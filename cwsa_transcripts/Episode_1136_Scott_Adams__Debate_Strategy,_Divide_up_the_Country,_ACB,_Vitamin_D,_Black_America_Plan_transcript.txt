[Applause]
hey
how's it going come on in
does it seem like i'm a little bit late
that's because i'm preparing
i have to get my whiteboard ready
because i know how much you like your
white
your whiteboard lessons so that's kevin
up
yeah this is the best part of the day
it's going to be pretty good
it's going to be off the hook and all
you need to enjoy it
to its maximum potential is
is what i think you know all you need is
a
copper mug or a glass of tank or chalice
or stein i can't juggle flask a vessel
of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure that dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and you can see the world improving with
every delicious taste
go
mmm let me tell you about a discovery i
made
recently i was trying to cut down on my
coffee uh well my caffeine
content and i found that if you add hot
water
to coffee so that it's half just
hot water and half coffee instead of
tasting like
bad watered down coffee it turns into a
different kind of
beverage it just tastes like
coffee flavored warm beverage you'd
think it would be terrible
but it's delicious and i can drink more
coffee that way
so it works has
joe biden declared a lid yet
has anybody heard from him because i
think this is just about the time
he wakes up and jill biden goes in and
shakes them a little bit and says joe
do you know where you are what's your
name
and if he says uh i think i'm i'm joe
biden and
i'm in my basement and if he gets the
right answer then she talks to the
campaign and she says
he's good to go put him on zoom quick
quick before he loses it
so that's what's going on um
we're watching uh as spotify employees
are apparently threatening to strike
over uh wanting to have control over joe
rogan's content
so so joe rogan gets this you know
enormous uh payday going over to spotify
and you you would assume
that part of the negotiations for that
deal
is some kind of agreement about who has
editorial control
well the employees of spotify who are
probably not
personally negotiating that deal have
decided that they can't possibly abide
by all that free speech that doesn't
agree with them
and so they might go on strike
oh my god
my smartest democratic friend who i
mention often
because i like to give you an update on
me trying to convince him out of his tds
so here's the funniest thing that
happened so this week as you know
the additional uh emails came out
about the the the whole investigation
into the russia collusion thing
and there were uh we got some new
information
about uh also hunter biden
and we got information about uh ukraine
and how hunter biden had taken
money from our you know a billionaire
russian
the ex-wife of the moscow mayor so
obviously pretty close to putin
so i was thinking to myself i can't wait
i can't wait to hear what my smartest
democratic friend says
because once this information about
hunter biden comes out
you're just gonna have to admit that
there's a problem with
joe biden because now that it's clear he
knew what was going on
that part we know from the new
documentation so joe biden was aware
of these concerns about his son as far
as we know
there's no there's no specific crime
that is alleged
and i'm not alleging that either it's
just that it's
really really swampy and so i thought to
myself
this is going to be good what in the
world
is my smartest democratic friend going
to say
that could possibly explain away
joe biden's connection to this swampy
stuff
and so he emailed me and said
well looks like the new york times has
looked into this and there's nothing to
worry about
what what and so i looked at the article
and sure enough the new york times
had decided that all the new information
about hunter biden
is not illegal so we're good here right
how in the world how in the world
do we go from from a trump has these
russian connections and it's the end of
the world
all the way to the other side where well
it turns out that
hunter biden and by extension you know
through the family blackmail connection
it looks like uh joe biden's got a
russia problem which doesn't matter
now suddenly no that's it's not
technically illegal
so why are you even bringing it up
so to watch the uh mental machinations
of people trying to trying to understand
their world
is pretty funny
all right i saw some experts giving some
debate
strategy advice and i would agree with
the following
advice that the more president trump
can tie every topic to the economy
the better he looks because the economy
is his strong
is the strongest topic so i would agree
that any time the president can say well
let's bring it over to the economy he's
going to
he's going to be winning and you can do
that with almost everything let's say
the topic is health care
the president will say yes i've done
this to lower drug prices
i've done this to allow you know
telemedicine across state lines which
should have
you know a good effect on things we're
doing this and that to
increase you know the market and these
are things that are going to be good for
the economy
and that works so you could talk about
climate change well we got to get the
economy right to
to be able to deal with the climate
change
you could do it with coronavirus you
know it's not just about the
you know the direct deaths it's also
about the economy
i think he can tie just about everything
to the economy
and the things that he can't are things
that people have already made their mind
up about
you know the supreme court picks for
example
there's not much you can do about that
republicans are going to like it
democrats are not going to like it but
there's not much to debate it's just
it's going to be what it is so i think
the president's got a real strong play
there just
tie everything to the economy any way
you can and he's going to look pretty
good
now do you think we're going to make it
all the way to tuesday
and have that debate what do you think
if you had to put the odds on it today
is joe biden going to make it to tuesday
and have a debate
here's what i would be looking for if
joe biden
is not going to debate on tuesday this
would be the tell
there would be a lid on joe biden
all the way through tuesday if you see a
if you see a lid on biden that just
clamps it down
from today all the way through tuesday
he's probably not going to debate
because that would be sort of the tell
that there
that something else is going to happen
that you know they have to replace him
or they're going to say well we need
some time out or
you know maybe we don't debate as of
yesterday
nancy pelosi was still saying
he was still she was still saying that
biden shouldn't debate
so you know that at the highest level of
the democrat
party they are not too happy about the
idea of him debating
so we'll see i would say uh
if you were to put the odds on it as of
today
the odds of him making it to tuesday
being on stage and debating
are greater than 50 percent probably
certainly greater than 50 percent
wouldn't you say yeah he can always say
he's prepping so he'll always have a
cover story
but if he if he puts the lid on for
three days i
i just think that would be a tell that
they they have something else
planned i would say there's a maybe a
70 to 80 percent chance at this point
he'll make it to the debate stage
it could be that the democrats uh
have decided that he might get through a
debate
now a perfect situation would be he gets
through one debate
doesn't do too badly you know you know
takes a few punches
but basically survives the debate what
would be the smartest
thing for the biden campaign to do if he
survives
one debate you already know the answer
if he survives one debate he's
definitely going to cancel the rest of
them
because if he survives one then it can
be said
that he can debate they can make the
case
but it would be crazy it would just be
crazy
for them to let him have more than one
if the first one goes okay
if it even just goes a little bit okay
you've got to cancel the rest of them
and it would be easy to do they would
just say
well look at what president trump did in
the first debate
all he did was lie so what would be the
point
of having another debate when all he's
going to do is lie
so it would be easy they just say we did
one debate we're good
now let's say they do one debate and he
just falls apart
what happens then well then the
democrats just go ahead and replace him
and they say you know okay we see it now
so we're going to make a quick change
it's going to be kamala probably
top of the ticket everything's the same
kamala biden you get the same package
there's no real difference
biden picked kamala as the vice
president because they have so much in
common
if you think about it nothing's really
changed all you did is change the name
and we've been calling it harris biden
take it anyway it's not that big a
change
don't worry about it after the election
biden will you know be replaced or
something
maybe before or maybe after so
i think what will happen here would be
my best guess
i think the democrats are going to roll
the dice
roll the yeah does it die roll the dice
on one debate i think it's a one debate
bet if it doesn't go well boom they
switch the ticket
if it does go well they cancel the rest
of the debates and try to ride it
that's what i would do all right
um it's starting to look
as if everyone except the trump campaign
colluded with russia in 2016.
because the more we find out about what
the steele dossier was up to
and the more we find out about what
hunter biden was up to
everything looks like they were all
colluding with russia
because the hunter biden connection with
the money coming in from
a russian oligarch and
and of course the steele dossier
apparently was put together by
a an alleged uh russian asset
was a was a major sub source for the uh
for the steele dossier
now given that brennan knew that
how is that not colluding with russia
if if you're literally working with
russia
on a common goal to overthrow the united
states
which is the allegation against brennan
how is that not
colluding now you could say well the
person we talked to wasn't
necessarily having a conversation with
putin that week
it might be just a russian but i don't
know if that's a thing because the
person that
he was dealing with for information
anyway
was a suspected russian asset which
means he would have connection to the
top
indirectly so
given that we we have this new model of
the world
that if if you accuse somebody of
something first
and it turns out you're the one who was
the doing it
people get exhausted by the original
accusation
and then when the truth comes out oh no
the person you
you accused was innocent all the time
completely innocent
but you the accuser were actually doing
that crime like crazy
somehow it doesn't hurt them
because we are so easily uh
rewired or we're we're so easily
you know we buy into the first story we
hear
that if the first story is that you're
accusing somebody of something
they can't even see you as the as a
perpetrator for example
let's say you wanted to murder somebody
this is what we've learned instead of
just going out and murdering them
you want to set the stage first so prior
to murdering somebody
you should publicly accuse the person
you plan to kill
of being a murderer and and you sell
that and the person will be like what
are you talking about
i'm not murdering anybody i'm just a
innocent citizen
no no no you're a murderer and you get
everybody to believe that they're a
murderer
and then you murder them and people will
have a hard time understanding
because it will be too much of a leap to
go all the way from
wait a minute are you saying that the
the murderer was
was actually the one you murdered
i i can't hold that in my head it's too
much of a leap
i can't be that wrong about something
cognitive this and
dissonance has just put up a wall i
cannot see
this new truth that you just murdered
this innocent person i just can't even
see it
my brain doesn't register it because i'm
still invested
in the fact that the person you murdered
i believed was a murderer
so if you don't think that's real then
you need to look into
brains a little bit more because that is
real
whoever accuses first has that permanent
advantage and it's
it's hard to you know erase a first
impression
on tucker carlson the other the other
night he had an expert talking about
how the united states is experiencing a
quote
color revolution i don't know all the
details about what this
quote color revolution is but the idea
is that we have people in the united
states
who working for intelligence agencies in
the past
have fomented revolution in other
countries
intentionally and they did it by simply
sowing chaos about the election process
so if you can get the citizenry to not
trust the election process
then you can have an actual revolution
because
you know the system will break down the
allegation is that the same people
literally the same people the actual
same people
who did this professionally overseas to
other countries
are literally specifically and even
publicly
doing it right here right now
and that and that there's a an active
color revolution being perpetrated in
this country
by the book publicly obviously
while we watch it right in front of us
by the same people
who are experts at doing this thing now
do you believe that
does that sound like something you
believe
here's my problem with it i don't know
what they would think is their
end game if you're if you're fermenting
revolution in another country
your end game is the revolution you just
want to weaken that other country
and if you can get a new regime and
that's friendly to your country well
that would be an advantage
but you don't really care that much if
that other country just falls apart
because it's not your country right so
if you do a color revolution in another
country
and it just goes to hell well it wasn't
your country
so that's the kind of risk you could
take with somebody else's country
but would you take this risk with your
own country
would you would you literally cause a
a violent probably to be violence a
violent revolution
in your own country thinking that would
work out
who exactly would be smart enough to
work in an intel
intel organization and also think that
you could have a violent
revolution in the united states and that
that would work out pretty well
i i have trouble understanding how this
plan makes sense so
which doesn't mean it's not happening i
just don't understand it
um lanny davis
noted republic i'm sorry a noted
democrat
lenny davis he tweeted this dear red
states
we're leaving we've decided we're
leaving we intend to form our own
country
we're taking the other blue states with
us that includes hawaii oregon
california new mexico washington
minnesota
wisconsin blah blah
and i saw that and i don't think he's
you i don't think that is a literal
statement
i think is more of a hyperbolic sort of
thing you say during the election period
but i have to say
it's not a bad idea it's not a bad idea
to at least test it here's what
i would love to see president trump do
he won't do this
so that this would not be something
you'd expect
president trump to do but if i were
president
this is what i would do i would say the
black lives matter and all the people
who were unhappy with systemic racism
i would say how about this we don't know
exactly what you want
we don't know exactly how to fix it but
we we would love to give you a plot of
land
we'll find a place in some state that's
friendly to this idea
and create effectively like a native
american reservation
where you'll just have your own rules
and we'll let you run things the way you
think
things should be run and you can just
build your own
society you can take donations from
soros or whoever you want to take
donations from there would be plenty of
people who would donate
and just try to build a functioning
non-systemic racist society
that is along the model that you would
like to see for the rest of the country
if it works maybe we'll take the good
parts and try to expand it to the
country
if you find some parts of it don't work
well then we won't expand those parts to
the rest of the country
but why don't you take take some land
and just go do what you want
now what would happen
would that actually happen would anybody
say whoa
that is a pretty progressive idea you
know
no matter what your plan is it does make
sense to test it first
and what an opportunity the the united
states is so open-minded they're going
to let us
have our own land and just test our
ideas and make this work
we're all in do you think that'll happen
no
no because everything we've learned so
far
is there doesn't seem to be anybody
involved with at least the leadership of
the movement
who is interested in solutions they're
not
interested in solutions if they were
everything would look different people
who are interested in solutions
do do things like the following hey
can we have a meeting our people have
some ideas
we want to bounce them off of you
we'll really float these up see what
people think maybe get a budget for this
see what we can do
are you seeing that no no you're not
you see crazy stuff like defund the
police but we don't know
exactly what that means you see we've
got to get rid of
institutional racism whatever that is
whatever it means to the person talking
we we have to tear down the system we've
got to burn it all down what does any of
that mean
anybody who is working on solutions it
would look
really really obvious what that looked
like you couldn't miss it
it would be people with actual plans
actual suggestions that were pretty
specific
hey how about this law how about this
budget
how about this area does this
differently how about we
train police in a different way that's
what it would look like
there's nothing like that happening so i
think you would
you would expose their movement for what
it is
by just giving them what they want and
and go to the high ground and say we're
going to give you everything you want
but obviously obviously you're going to
test it first
because that's the way you would do
anything there's nothing you wouldn't
test first if you could right just
common sense
so give them what they want and the
whole thing would fall apart that's a
persuasion trick by the way
the persuasion trick is instead of
arguing with people who appear to be
irrational or maybe they're lying about
what they want
either way it looks the same instead of
arguing with them that doesn't work
if they're irrational you can't argue
with them and if they're lying about
their true motives
you can't argue with that either because
they'll just keep lying
so the thing you can do is agree with
them
and offer to give them what they're
asking for
and in the process of trying to accept
everything they're asking for it will
become obvious it wasn't real
so it's one way to solve it
the big news of course is amy coney
barrett
who i love the fact that the
public is deciding to call her acb
now you think of aoc when you think of
acb
and i think these three named people
need to be
initials but there's something that
happens when somebody gets
a three-letter initial
be it to aoc be it jfk
be it lbj or be it
be it anybody else mlk i guess
anybody who gets a three letter initial
or
and uh rbg as well
anybody who gets an initial three
initial name
is more important you you don't think
that
should be the case right and you say to
yourself well
just having a cool nickname doesn't
really make you
more than you were but it does
this is one of the things that i learned
years ago in college
so in college some of us got
nicknames i was one of them my college
roommate was big on
giving people their name names so here's
one guy
who'd assigned everybody their nickname
it was it was your nickname all the way
through college
it was like a superpower he had to give
you a nickname to stuck
sort of trump-like and he gave me the
nickname
w just the letter w because i once wore
a shirt that a big w
on it for my school that i grew up on
wyndham was the name of the town
and and so for four years of college
my nickname was w and there were people
i knew pretty well who had no idea what
my name was
because i was just w and there were
other people who had names there was a
there was a guy called the kewl sure for
a molecule
because he would get so high that he
called it getting small
so he was just the molecule and then the
cule and what happened was
that the people who had cool nicknames
actually
came to be seen as a little bit cooler
now this might have been my imagination
you know it's
subjective of course but it seemed to me
that when people got a nickname they
they
elevated to a level of just sort of
an icon that's the wrong word i don't
know
that you became something like a symbol
or something
so there is something powerful about
these
initial nicknames they tend to go to
people who have
some higher level of importance all
right so the big story is that she's a
member of this
people at brain is a charismatic
covenant community
so it's they're they're catholic or
catholic
catholic friendly or catholic leaning or
mostly catholic or something
but they have some interesting views
that includes
allegedly and i'm going to put a a
really big legend on this
because i'm very skeptical that this is
happening currently
it could be that they're being blamed or
painted with something that used to
happen but doesn't anymore
because i'm not entirely entirely
believing
that they speak in tongues do you think
that
whatever place of worship that
acb goes to with her family do you think
they
actually speak in tongues you know while
she's there
at the service i'm guessing not
which doesn't mean that some part of the
organization has never done that or
doesn't do it
but i'm kind of guessing probably not if
i had to put money on it i'd say
something like i feel like that's
70 chance she's never been in a room
where that happened
i could be wrong somebody says
lid did the lid get is there a lid
now it does make sense if you get at
least one
one more lid before tuesday or two but
if
if it's all lit if it's lit all the way
to tuesday
that means something all right so
i don't know how real this stuff is but
uh it's gonna be the big
topic now here's the beauty of it as uh
i think it was
uh uh tim young pointed this out on
twitter
he said uh every time a democrat calls
uh
amy coney barrett a cult member which is
what they're calling her
thousands of undefense catholics turn
into trump voters
and i think that's got to be true i if
you're
if you're a practicing catholic and you
hear the democrats
call somebody who also was associated
with catholicism
if you hear them call her a cult member
are you going to say to yourself oh no
no that's the different kind
you know she's she's over there doing
speaking in tongues so that's
that's a different kind so yeah maybe
that's a cult
not me i'm just a regular catholic
so that doesn't affect me i don't think
people are wired that way
i think if she's called the catholic and
you happen to be called a catholic
and somebody is making fun of that other
kind of catholic
you don't shade it and say oh that's not
me that's a different kind of catholic
i feel as if you're going to take that
personally
if you're a normal human being you're
going to take it personally
so the the beauty of trump's
trap is that the more they complain
about
her the more votes he gets
i think i think is pretty direct
here's the most fun part of uh
of the allegations against acb's
religion is that uh
quote one of its most notable features
is the submissive role played by women
some of whom were called to quote
handmaids at least until the handmaid's
tale aired in 2017
at that point they started referring to
them as women leaders
[Laughter]
they're women leaders now do you think
that the phrase
women leaders suggest submissive
handmaids
i got a feeling that we don't quite have
the full story
of what was going on there because i
don't know how you would
take somebody that your own religion
considers
to use their words submissive and that
you just rename them leaders
and it's like oh it's okay we just
rename them leaders
still submissive but we're just going to
call them leaders
i don't know if that's what's going on
it feels more like if i had to guess
and this is just a guess pure
speculation
that if you dug into this a little bit
you would find that whoever
whoever labeled their belief
as a belief that women are submissive
i think you'd find maybe that's just not
the case i think you would find that
that if submissive is even part of the
belief it may be in some specific way
i don't think it means in life in
general so i got a feeling that we don't
know what's going on there
but here's my take on this suppose the
left
goes after her for this allegation
however true it is we don't know
and suppose they say hey we object to
her
in part because she's she she has a
belief
that women should be submissive what to
their husbands
maybe maybe that's the context whatever
it is and again
you should be really skeptical about any
of this
i don't know what the odds are that any
of this is true
but let's just talk it through let's say
what if it is
isn't that a sort of an lgbtq problem
because wouldn't it simply be a
lifestyle preference
if true don't know if it is but
if true that it was her preference or
other people in the
in the religious group that they would
be
and i hate to use the word because i
think it's inaccurate but submissive to
their husbands
isn't that just a lifestyle choice why
is that anybody's business
because i don't believe they're saying
that you and i should change what we're
doing
i don't believe they've ever gotten in
my face and said
scott you need to change what you're
doing
doesn't bother me so if there's somebody
who in their private life has a personal
way of
relating to somebody that's different
than yours
how is that a problem and shouldn't you
be the open-minded people who say
hey sexuality is a is a you know big
continuum or rainbow which is my belief
i believe my belief is is that every
everybody is so different
that you know grouping people into these
arbitrary
categories is is
is suboptimal so i'm i'm as pro
lgbtq as anybody could ever be i'm super
pro
lgbtq i'm extra i'm
extra pro lgbtq the more the better
but it feels to me like although this is
not a sexual preference
that it's in that that area where it
should just be a personal choice
why is that anybody's business uh bill
maher is making news again
by uh i don't know why this is news he's
the most famous uh celebrity atheist in
the world
so he said some biting things about her
religious beliefs
is that a surprise that he said that
here's what i would like since everybody
has worked up about
president trump saying that he would not
guarantee
a peaceful transfer of power has anybody
asked
the democratic leaders if they would
commit to a
peaceful continuance of the trump
administration
should he win election how has that
never been asked as soon as you hear it
you know i tweeted this this morning the
moment you hear this
doesn't your brain say uh yeah that's
missing
nobody's asked pelosi can you commit
to a peaceful continuance of the trump
administration
should he win the election that's a fair
question
should should they be asking biden
should they be asking kamala harris
should they be asking
chuck schumer yeah you should ask
every one of those people to get on
record would you support and commit to
a peaceful continuance of the
administration
should they win nobody's asking
if you have if you don't see that asked
by today
by the end of today because you know
there's always a democrat floating
around you can ask this question it's
sunday the
notes what is today saturday so you can
certainly ask the question
if you don't see that you should just
assume there's no such thing as news
anymore
that it's just so broken that you should
forget about it
um let me do my uh
impression of chuck schumer uh
is it my imagination or is chuck schumer
the worst
public speaker you've ever seen for a
politician
i don't know if i've ever seen a worse
public speaker
how in the world does he get his you
know
leadership job by being the worst public
speaker
let me give you an impression of chuck
schumer
giving a public statement glasses down
like this
and president trump he is continuing to
do
bad things and bad things are done by
the president
because of his badness and his meanness
and
he doesn't believe in freedom
he hates people he would like to destroy
the economy
for selfish narcissistic reasons
and my my god how does somebody like
that become a leader
literally all he does is read
and he doesn't even read sincerely he
doesn't even read sincerely
if you look at prominent politicians in
either party
would you say that aoc whether you
disagree with her or agree with her
doesn't she look and come off as being
sincere
i would say so she looks sincere to me
that doesn't mean she
is but in terms of how she presents
herself
looks sincere does president trump look
sincere yeah he does does
vice president pence seem sincere when
he speaks in public
totally he seems 100 sincere again
you don't know what people are thinking
internally but they certainly present
themselves
as sincere how about most of the
politicians you see talking on
television
do most of them look sincere a lot of
them do
some don't but i've never seen anybody
who looked
intentionally insincere before
schumer actually looks like he's not
pretending to be serious
he looks with that with that smirk that
he always has
he looks like i'm not even pretending
that this is real
and i feel like it's disrespectful to me
as a citizen
that you wouldn't pretend you mean what
you're saying
at least pretend you believe it don't
ask me to listen to it
if you're not even going to pretend you
believe in yourself
and i don't think he pretends he
believes it it is a weird look
pelosi is kind of a hybrid she she does
a little bit
better job of acting sincere
but the things she says are so
ridiculous lately that you know they're
not
um so that's different all right
um
here's uh here's a question
was it uh bill maher who asked this of
bernie sanders
listen to this question in the best
possible world
biden wins and eat and takes office and
then bill maher
asks what do we do with these
republicans
ones who showed that when it mattered
that they were willing to cast aside
democracy
that's pretty chilling isn't it what are
we
what are we going to do with them what
do you mean what are you going to do
with them
how about you don't do anything with
them how about you go about your
business
how about you be happy if your team won
you form a government and you try to run
the country
how about you don't round up the
republicans and punish them
how about if you were to do that that
would be the end of the republic
because let me tell you if conservatives
or republicans
start getting rounded up and punished
because this question is what do we do
with them
how do you interpret what do we do with
them other than there would be some
active measures to do something
what send us to uyghur re-education
camps what exactly does that look like
so i think that is a little bit chilling
i would remind you that i think there's
no chance that the country will be
ripped apart
and that we won't exist in 2021.
by 2021 may or may not be by
you know the end of january but
certainly in 2021 we'll have an
actual president we'll still have a
country and we're going to be
kicking ass with the economy so it's
going to be fine
you know the you're feeling about
whether there's going to be a revolution
or you know violence in the streets and
all that there will be violence in the
streets
but there is now it probably won't be
that different than every single tuesday
there's just violence in the streets
every day now it doesn't
but that's that's sort of the new normal
but we will be fine
but uh and the reason it seems more
dangerous it's just that the
the emotions are elevated for election
period
um what would be the point of holding
hearings for acb and the
the supreme court confirmation in normal
times
it's a good process because you want to
make sure you've vetted the candidates
you want to you want to give the public
some credibility
to say that okay all the people who
really know what they're talking about
both left and right have looked at this
candidate they've wrestled with it
they've you know they've pushed all the
the buttons and kicked all the tires
under in a normal situation it's a good
process
i have my favorite of it but this is not
a normal situation
the democrats have uh they have
broadcast that they don't plan to treat
it seriously
haven't they just fact check me on this
has the democrats not broadcast in the
clearest possible terms
that they don't have any intention of
treating this
in a legitimate manner they just want to
stop it and make a political point
now under those conditions i would apply
the
the bill bar rule you know bill barr
agreed to
testify to congress and then they didn't
let him talk
they kept reclaiming their time so when
when the additional people were
requested by nadler
to go to the uh go to congress and
testify
the department of justice said no
because you've now
signaled so clearly that you don't take
the process
seriously it would be absurd
for us to be involved in something that
you've already told us won't be a
serious process
if there was some hope it would be
serious if there was some
remote chance something good could come
out of it for the country
even for us oh we might do it but now
that you've told us
in no uncertain terms that you're not
going to be serious about this it's just
going to be a stunt
why would we why would we show up
likewise with the supreme court stuff
given that the votes are there to
confirm her
given that she was recently vetted for
her you know the job that she has
um it would be just foolish to hold
hearings
so lindsey graham uh i think he's still
planning to hold hearings
um if you do you should at least
keep the option open of closing down the
hearings right away
if it doesn't work because i don't want
to waste time
there's nothing to be gained as as a
citizen there's just nothing to be
gained by that process
just vote on it get it over with all
right it could be an advantage to the
president though to drag it down a
little bit
he might like the fight the
daily mail and of britain is reporting
that
boston university researchers found that
coveted patients who had
sufficient levels of vitamin d were
about 52 percent less likely
to die after hospitalization so we have
yet another study now this is not one of
those
randomized controlled studies this is
another one of those they just look at
the data of things that have already
happened
so it's not it's not that gold standard
kind that you would like to really
really know that you know what you're
talking about
so we haven't reached that level of
certainty and i
and i worry a little bit about cause and
effect because it could be
that people who are in a weakened state
also have less vitamin d
and it's just a coincidence so there
just could be a coincidence
well we don't have what would be better
would be we treated this group with
vitamin d and this group
we didn't and we got a different result
that would be better
if it were randomized and controlled it
would be better anyway
at about 42 percent of americans are
vitamin d deficient
now given that we do know that vitamin d
is unambiguously good for you
and even if it didn't help you with
coronavirus
we could all agree you know science
agrees there's no debate about it really
vitamin d is good so the question was
asked
why is fauci not pushing vitamin d like
crazy
shouldn't we be pushing vitamin d like
crazy is there anybody who is not taking
vitamin d
i think vitamin d supplements every day
and
and when it's not so smoky in california
that i can't go outside
i also go outside every day to make sure
i get
a little bit of sun with my sunscreen on
etc
but i feel as if the government should
be pushing vitamin d
and i feel like that's a mistake that
it's not happening
because it's all upside no downsides
except i guess you could overdose on it
if you went too far
in helsinki they're testing cove into
sniffing dogs
you've heard about this before but
apparently
it seems to be working at least the
early
indications so the dog will just go up
and sniff you
and it can tell even before you have
symptoms apparently
it can tell if you have covent dogs are
unlikely to get covered so they can it's
a little safer for them to be sniffing
i guess cats have a bigger problem with
it than dogs
they can get it but not as often so
here's the question
i asked to you could
science make something that smells like
coven but isn't dangerous and
if they could make something that smells
like covent
but isn't dangerous could they
distribute it to everybody who has a dog
to train their dog because i can train
my dog
i think i mean i i don't know how
sensitive the dog's nose has to be
but i'm guessing probably most dogs
could do it
you know i know some dogs like
bloodhounds are extra extra good at
smelling
but all dogs are pretty good at smelling
if you could give me a little a little
smell tab
that smelled like covet to a dog it
wouldn't smell like anything to me
if i could train my dog with that
i think we'd be three weeks away from uh
getting rid of coronavirus
because there are enough people with
dogs
who can trade a dog right how hard would
it be to train a dog
that gets a treat when they smell one
thing and not another
it would be the easiest thing in the
world i could train my dog to
sniff it i'm pretty sure and she's not
like the
the genius dog of dogs
somebody says didn't i predict this
i remember talking about it but i
believe i read about it as a possibility
before i predicted it
i i would take credit for it if i
thought i deserved it
boston dynamics a robot making company
they make that robot dog that looks so
creepy
have you seen it it's like this
four-legged
walking robot dog that is just so scary
it's crazy
but apparently now they're they're going
into production and for 75
000 you can have your own robot dog
called a spot
and if you don't think this stuff's
gonna change everything
you gotta you got a new thing coming
because these
this robot is gonna change everything i
mean you could just drop these into
dangerous
neighborhoods and well i suppose they'd
get
torn apart they'd probably get broken
pretty quickly
here's a fact you probably didn't know
i'll just throw this in here as a fun
fact
did you know that the organizer of the
charlottesville
tiki torch racist march
named richard spencer did you know that
he endorses joe biden
that's right joe biden's primary claim
is that president trump was sort of
favorable to these racists in
charlottesville but the guy who
organized it
richard spencer has publicly endorsed
joe biden now does it mean anything does
it mean that joe biden is a racist
because a racist endorsed him no
it doesn't work that way nor does it
work that way if
some racist endorses president trump
it doesn't make the rest of his
followers racist
and it doesn't make trump racist it
doesn't work that way
people endorsing you don't turn you into
them that's not a thing
but it's fun to note that the
the biggest racist in the country at
least the one who's made the most
trouble recently
endorses biden so
take that for what it's worth here's a
question for you is the phrase
african-american done it's over isn't it
i had been using the phrase just out of
respect
because i like to use any name that any
group wants
to be called so whether you are an
individual
or a member of a group if you have a
preferred name that you want to be
called i'm all in
right no reason to make people mad if
somebody has a preferred name and
there's another name that makes them
unhappy
don't use the unhappy one use the one
that makes them happy
right we're all trying to be in this
country together so i'm a big fan
of using words that make people
comfortable um
but it seems to me that because of black
lives matter
and and that phrase becoming the
dominant phrase
black lives matter that it's not african
american lives matter
they don't do it that way it seems to me
that plus the fact that recently there
was a decision to capitalize the b
in black by a number of publications
which i also agree with by the way
i agree with that as a as an author i
think capitalizing the b
in black adds a little clarity to
sentences
calls it out a little bit you know as
long as you do the same thing with the w
and white i think it's just more clear
it's better writing so i'm in favor of
that as well but it seems to me that
that black is now just the acceptable
common word everybody agree can we agree
from today on
that the um the african-american
is just unnecessary and it is no longer
a
term of respect because the word black
and if you write it capital b is equal
maybe better i don't know is it better
or equal
[Music]
but in any case i'm i think going
forward i'm going to discontinue
the phrase african america in american
in favor of black
if if there's anybody black who has an
objection to that let me know
let me know because i would listen to
that
[Music]
here's a question for you that nobody
asks
you know i talk about thinking past the
sale
there's there's a gigantic thinking past
the sale that's happening now
and it goes like this
in this world there are people who have
bad luck
they're just born that way and it never
gets better
you're just born into a bad situation
and you're
you're just having bad luck your whole
life there are other people who are just
born with
everything they're they're born rich
they're born healthy
they're born handsome good looking
beautiful
just all good but suppose you're here
you're you don't have great luck you
don't have the worst luck
but let's say you have a health problem
your parents are over alcoholics
you're you know you've got ptsd
you've got some serious problems and
they're not your fault
things you were born with let's say
you're you've got a physical disability
there was an accident you went to war
you got injured
it could be just you know hundreds of
different things
that would all fit into the category of
bad luck
the proposition that we're being given
is that this person with the bad luck
if they were white would owe this person
who has slightly worse luck
some some money or reparations or some
kind of consideration
or that the person who is not you
has a preferred problem that there's
there's such a thing
as a a kind of bad luck that's the worst
kind now let's say you had the legacy of
slavery
that ripples through time you find
yourself in a bad neighborhood
there's crime and bad education all
kinds of problems
there do you have a thing called bad
luck
yeah you do yeah you do that sounds
pretty bad luck to me
if if if racism and
slavery is still affecting you
you know hundreds of years later and and
you still haven't climbed out of it and
you've always been behind the
behind the uh the eight ball or whatever
yeah that's bad luck but why is your bad
luck
a preferred bad luck now not talking
about myself
right so don't put me in the
conversation because
i'm kind of over here at the moment
things are pretty good
so you know i'm i'm in a good place i'm
not
not complaining but there are a lot of
you who are watching this
who are not not black who just didn't
have a good life
things went wrong why is it that you're
just an
 right but if you're over here
and you've got bad luck
and it has a specific flavor of bad luck
it came from slavery there's still
systemic racism etc
and that's the the nature of your bad
luck why is yours favored
what why if i'm over here as a good luck
person
why why should i transfer some wealth
and attention
to somebody who's in the same
neighborhood of bad luck
but i but not you wha what's wrong with
you
why are you the why can't why
can't you get helped
so the the thinking past the sale
is that there's a favored kind of bad
luck
that some kind of bad luck is the good
kind of bad luck
and there's another kind of bad luck
that's the bad kind of bad luck
but that's not a thing if you have bad
luck
that's it that's the whole story you got
bad luck
so i think we've been duped into
thinking there's a favored
kind of bad luck and that's
it's quite distorting all right um
i i asked uh i asked on twitter
yesterday i think i mentioned this
i asked people on in my non-scientific
twitter poll is there something going on
now i just saw my audience drop off
there might be something happening in
the news
that 92 percent of people who answered
my very unscientific poll most of these
would probably be trump supporters if
they follow me on twitter
and 92 of them said they
have less empathy for black lives matter
in 2020 because of the the protest
92 percent of them think worse of them
how in the world is this working what is
it that black lives matter
wants if what they wanted was respect
they're getting the opposite aren't they
they're getting the opposite of their
stated
intention and it's obvious isn't it
it if you were just an obs tried to be
an objective observer you know you came
from another planet and you didn't have
any bias
and you're just going to look look at
the planet from a distance to say okay
how's this strategy going the black
lives matter people say they want to
they want to be considered you know full
full humans i guess would be the the
best way to say it you know not
considered in any way
some kind of a second class citizen
a completely legitimate thing to want
and i would uh
certainly want them to have every bit of
that
but here's the thing if you looked at
what they're doing
isn't what they're doing exactly the
opposite of what you would do
if your stated goal was to be treated
with respect
i don't know how you do things that
guarantee you will be treated
with disrespect while fighting for
respect
i just don't understand how that works
so all right
so i think that's not working
now the other thing that is unstated
watch me state something that's unstated
that makes you
uncomfortable are you ready you hear
about all these uh
these people have decided to move out of
the urban areas
so people moving away from san francisco
people moving out of new york city and
whenever we tell this story
we always say well it's it's people
getting
away from crime yeah
yeah that's what it is that that is
accurate it is people who want to get
away from crime
but here's the thing that people aren't
saying
it is really white people getting away
from black people
right now i
how bad does that sound this sound that
sounds as bad as it could possibly be
but what other outcome could you imagine
would happen
if you were a well-off white person
living in a city that was on fire every
night
because black lives matter was
protesting would you say to yourself
uh i'll stay here probably not
you would probably get as far as you
could from black lives matter
supporters as you could because it
doesn't look like they
have a solution in mind it doesn't look
like there's an end state
where you say okay everything will be
fine once their demands are addressed
we'll be back to normal it doesn't look
like that's a possibility it doesn't
even look like it's on the table
not even an option so if you're a
typical
white person living in a city what is
your internal mental process
you're probably thinking i gotta get as
far away from
black lives matter supporters as i can
and in your mind are you thinking that
that also includes
you know the antifa and other white
allies and protesters
maybe but you're probably also thinking
that you're getting away from black
people
so how do we get to this point is that
an advantage
is it a better world that something like
i don't know 40 of white people in the
united states
are actively thinking how can i get
further away from black people
because you know that's exactly what's
happening that's not good
that's just about as bad as things could
be so
we need to fix that but that's what's
happening nobody wants to say that out
loud but that's exactly what's happening
president trump trying to make things
better
has proposed the 500 billion black
america plan
which very cleverly uh designated both
kkk and antifa as terrorist
organizations
now in terms of political cleverness
this is really good all right the fact
that he paired
kkk which so many people wanted
designated as a terrorist
organization i i guess i agree with it
in the sense that i wasn't too aware
what the kkk was doing
in recent years i will assume it's true
that they were involved in terrorist
things
um that i mean it feels like there must
be somebody involved in that
so i would say that that seems
reasonable and
most of the country would think that's
pretty reasonable to designate the kkk
as
a terrorist organization but the fact
that he could throw
antifa in there at the same time because
now
these protesters are going to be part
black lives matter who have not been
designated as domestic terrorists
you could argue that some of them should
be but they haven't been
but they are now marching with domestic
terrorists
let me ask you this if you're marching
with
terrorists are you not a terrorist
because i'm pretty sure i've been
hearing since 2018
that if you quote marched with
racists you can't say you're not you're
you're not a racist
and i completely agree in
charlottesville the fine people were not
marching with them
they were in the same zip code but they
had nothing to do with the marchers they
were
they were a separate group but it is
true
had those fine people so-called fine
people
if they had been physically marching
with the tiki torch people
then i would certainly say oh those are
not fine people
look at them they're actually literally
marching with
racist chanting racist stuff of course i
would condemn them
exactly the same as the people who you
know maybe have a
membership in a racist organization
there would be no difference they'd be
marching together
but now antifa and black lives matter
are going to be marching together
literally marching
actually physically marching every night
so the president has just
fined people uh he's just fine people
antifa and black lives matter he just
got away with calling antifa a terrorist
organization because
he called the kkk a terrorist
organization at the same time
which kind of makes it all okay right
you can't really argue with that
as long as it's both
who who argues
so i don't think people quite see
the brilliance of this move this is
really really smart
one of the smartest plays i've ever seen
in politics
you know because it kind of came out of
left field and just suddenly this
boom was right there and i was like oh
okay that's really good
now the another part of this is uh
they're making lynching
a national hate crime who disagrees
who disagrees with lynching being a
national hate crime
i don't know i don't think anybody
disagrees with that well there's always
somebody who disagrees
but that seems pretty popular if
if president trump is this big old
racist
why is he the one suggesting that
lynching
be a national hate crime if he's a big
old racist
why is he the one who just made the kkk
a terrorist organization if he is the
racist
why is he the one who did prison reform
why is he the one who supported the
historically black colleges with their
funding why is he the one
who brags every day about low black
unemployment i've got a feeling
that trump's black voter numbers are
going to be just crazy
this might be the biggest shock in the
system
is the number of black people who are
not crazy
you know the ones who look at this and
say uh
you know i like the idea of black lives
matter i mean
i'm totally down with the philosophy i
like everything about that i like that
they're fighting for
you know people like me i like that a
lot
but they don't seem to be having an
exactly a productive
direction with their marxism etc
i think you're going to see just a lot
of black people
say how about we just don't go down that
path
all right so part of this is a 500
billion dollar
uh capital kind of thing we don't know
the details but apparently something to
make
capital more available it's all good
stuff good political play
separately in one poll support for black
lives matter demonstrations
have fallen from 54 percent
three months ago to 39
today that's a big drop
so black lives matter is now way
underwater
at 39 support
so now the president has just tagged
them with being domestic
terrorists because they're marching with
domestic terrorists antifa
uh i don't think that's going to help
him all right
um
uh you know i could talk more but i
think uh oh let's talk about joe biden
and his quote uh so there's a video from
20s i don't know a few years ago 2016 or
something
where joe biden was talking to the
troops and
he said quote clap for that you stupid
bastards
so he called the troops stupid bastards
to their faces
but he was obviously making a joke but
it was sort of awkward the way he said
it and
but is that the kind of joke you make to
the troops
i accept that it's a joke
and i'm certainly not the guy who's
going to argue that
a joke's not a joke right because i
you know i spend so much time saying did
you not realize the president was joking
so i'm not going to like you know
reverse that just because i'm talking
about biden
biden was obviously joking but
is that the kind of joke that feels
right to you
right if you uh
you can imagine a million kinds of jokes
that are definitely jokes and they're
just intended as jokes
but they're still offensive right
is a uh what about a uh an ethnic joke
an ethnic joke is a joke
but it's really offensive is it okay
is it okay because it's a joke no it's
not okay
because in addition to being a joke it's
kind of offensive
and i would say that even
joking to the troops calling them stupid
bastards
that's not really as funny as it should
be so
i would criticize him for um
for being awkward and offensive uh
accidentally but it was a joke
all right gayle king got into uh pelosi
a little bit
and said that when pelosi calls uh
refers to trump and her henchmen
that she's just being as as bad as trump
is
and so even gayle king is calling out
pelosi's
language all right i don't want to go
too long today there's so much news
so much so much is happening that's all
i got for today
and um
was that the line yeah you could you
could google that
that's all i got for today and i will
talk to you tomorrow
