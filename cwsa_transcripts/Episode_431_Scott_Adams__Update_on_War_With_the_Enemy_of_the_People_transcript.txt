[Music]
hey everybody
come on in here gather around
grab your mug grab your chalice your
stein
grab your glass grab your thermos
because you know what time it is it's
time
for coffee with scott adams and we are
ready to enjoy
the simultaneous sip for those of you
who are nimble a finger
and ready for this raise your
chalice and join me for the simultaneous
episode
good stuff so i note that
there's a group of child protesters
who are protesting um
i guess they're going to mitch
mcconnell's office and protesting
and you know that they already protested
with dianne feinstein that didn't work
out
so well for them and so the question i
ask myself is
have the democrats decided to use
children to make their argument now
i don't want to make the obvious joke
that aoc is 29
and she's kind of young and that might
explain a lot
but it does strike me as
curious that the democrats are literally
sending
children to make their arguments
children they can't make their arguments
with adults
do you really need children now there
was a
uh hilarious but possibly shocking
poll that we just saw go around
david axelrod sent a poll around and i
tweeted it in which the priorities of
the country were ranked
of course stuff with the economy and
healthcare and stuff were up toward the
top
but way down at the bottom of the list
of priorities
second from the bottom was climate
change
after all that's been said and done
about climate change
it's at the it's at the very bottom
of the list of priorities now i wouldn't
make
too much out of that because it doesn't
mean it's not a problem
it just means people have ranked it low
and that could be an artifact
of the fact that half of the country
thinks it's literally a nothing so if
you took
any of those items on the list that
people say
are a big problem in half of the country
said well it doesn't even exist as a
problem
it would rank at the bottom so for
example
if half of the country didn't care about
the economy
then no matter how much half of the
other half cared about it would still be
at the bottom
because half the country doesn't care
about it at all
so uh being at the bottom of the
priorities
is not an indication that that the
public
doesn't care about it that's that's a
false interpretation in my opinion
it's it's a it's an indication that
half of the country doesn't even think
it exists as a problem
and half of the country in these are
rough numbers you know maybe it's 30
percent maybe it's 40 percent
maybe it's 50 and then another big chunk
of the country
thinks it's the worst problem in the
world but
since the poll question presumably did
not
capture the let's say the degree of
caring
meaning that if half the country say
it's irrelevant and half the country say
it's the biggest problem in the universe
it's still going to get rated as not
much of a problem because half of the
people said it wasn't anything
so that was a little bit misleading poll
but interesting to see where it where it
ranks
all right um
so we're watching um
cnn and the anti-trumpers in general
open what i call the the portal to fake
news hell and that's in the form of
primarily michael cohen he's sort of
he's sort of the first
demon out of the portal to fake news
hell and they have to
they have to work hard to come up with
something
because the president's got such a
strong hand
this week first of all whenever the
whenever the president goes overseas
good things seem to happen at least in
terms of the public's opinion
of his competency and everything else
so the fact that he's overseas at all is
positive for the president
because it always is the fact that
china has
the fact that china is starting to talk
about meeting at mar-a-lago
because everybody's expecting things to
turn into an agreement
is fantastically good for this president
can you imagine anything more mind
effing to the anti-trumpers than
if we don't know this is going to happen
yet so i'm getting ahead of myself but
i do predict it will happen
what will the anti-trumpers say
if trump comes up with a pretty good and
i won't even say great
if he comes up with a pretty good
improvement
on our trade agreement with china and
let's say it includes a lot of the
intellectual property stuff now nobody
would expect
china not to try to cheat on stuff
because you know it's the real world but
if we have an agreement that's got some
some teeth in it that says if you do
cheat these things will happen
we might have something really good
coming out of this don't know
too early to say but suppose it happens
what would that do to the people who
thought he was a crazy
maniac it will show
that his approach is the best
we've ever seen and by his approach i'm
going to describe it this way
being respectful and personal to the
leaders of countries that are
in some ways um antagonistic to us
some way sometimes enemies sometimes
just uh
competitors but he's
he's respectful and personal and very
complementary to the leader
at the same time he acts tough as
possible in the negotiations
that formula is probably going to be the
formula that forever is
considered the standard assuming things
go well with china
and then i'm also going to assume that
things go well with north korea
because i think they are now i'm still
seeing people on social media
saying to me scott you idiot
you idiot can't you see that the
president
has accomplished nothing in north korea
and that's a real that's a real
head shaker because how could you watch
the news for the past you know two years
and conclude that the president has
accomplished nothing with north korea
now you could certainly say there's a
lot more to go
you could certainly say it has not
reached the standard that we hope it
will get to
very reasonable things to say in fact
most people would agree
but to say that literally nothing good
has happened
that is not that's not part of the
sane world and here's how i like to
describe
it what the president did
was he removed the reason for nuclear
war
with north korea he took the reason away
the reason that it was ever a risk is
that north korea was pretty sure
we wanted to attack them at any minute
do you think that they believe that now
nope
do you believe that north korea thinks
that their nuclear weapons
are now a strategic asset or
now a strategic liability what do you
think is the mental process
of kim jong-un and i don't know if
anybody else matters in terms of
decision making but let's say just kim
do you think he sees his own nukes
as an asset because he's not at war with
anybody
what what do you use them for the
president's being nice he's offering
economic development
we have no border disputes south korea
is okay with them
china's okay with them exactly who would
go to war with north korea
nobody nobody
so at the moment kim's nukes are
sort of a bargaining chip but they're
also his biggest liability it's the
thing that is making him
least um let's say
least likely to stay in his job because
we've offered something much better than
having nukes and i think the president
has sold that version of reality
in a way that kim can look at it and say
yeah he's met with me twice i've looked
in his eyes we get along great i don't
think he means to kill me
right if you spend enough time in a room
with somebody you could probably detect
whether they plan to kill you like
literally kill you
and i think that if you spend enough
time with trump
and he and kim get along they have some
laughs they figure out what to do about
economic development
they agree that they need to get to
denuclearization
you know the details may not matter so
much and in the short run
in the long run they matter of course
i think i think it's the biggest
accomplishment
maybe any leader has ever has ever
achieved
somebody said that nixon going to china
might be the same level of
accomplishment but i don't know if we
were on the brink of nuclear war with
china maybe
some historians can correct me on that
but it seems to me
that taking somebody from the brink of
nuclear war
to hey buddy can we talk about nuclear
development
is the biggest accomplishment of any
president
i don't know that anybody's ever done
anything
that clever and that good that you could
you could specifically say was the
president's action
right i don't think anybody is saying
well the president was in charge but
other things happened and other people
were doing things and
there were other forces that made the
good thing happen i don't think
anybody's saying that
i think people are saying that his exact
personality
and his exact strategy with north korea
turned a nuclear holocaust into
a economic opportunity
nobody's ever done anything like that
before it's
enormous and i would think that we're on
a very long path
to do not having a nuclear risk
whatever that looks like all right
uh i'm loving the fact that
bernie sanders is getting a lot of heat
for apparently he used a lot of private
jets
when he was helping hillary clinton
campaign
so because he was busy a flying uh
commercial is not really effective so in
order to make all the
the stops that hillary clinton wanted of
him
he requested and got private jet service
but of course that works against his
works against his
you know green climate change
kind of a vibe so he's getting a lot of
heat for that
now on a realistic level i'm really not
the guy
who's going to say that him taking that
a leader taking a private jet is ever a
bad idea
i am of the opinion the rational opinion
that if your leader is the one who has
the biggest leverage
in terms of how things go they should
take private planes
and their time is worth more than other
people's time
and you just can't compare what the
leader does to to what you know the
population
as a whole should do so that's that's
crazy but
it works against bernie and the funniest
part was
one of bernie's ex-campaign people
said that the uh the clinton uh
supporters or the clinton campaign
people
were were just huge they said
they're all
and they're just like terrible people
for letting this story about the
the jet requests get out
all right um so you may have seen
that uh joel pollock retweeted with a
with some inflammatory language uh
a chris cuomo's
little bit he did i think last night in
which he played a clip
of the president uh saying
out of context that you know he played
eclipse
as if the president had called the
protest
the neo-nazis in charlottesville fine
people
now of course that's fake news he did
not call
the the neo-nazis fine people but cnn
reports it that way
what it what of course he was speaking
about was that there are fine people on
both sides of the
confederate statue issue more generally
now i'm against confederate statues so
i'm not on his side on that point
but nonetheless it's being reported
in a fake news way and
so let me let me call out for you
some more dog that isn't barking so
remember uh it was about a week ago i
said i'm going to say in public
loudly and clearly that the
charlottesville
report that the president said the
neo-nazis were fine people
i'm going to say it's fake news and a
hoax i'm going to say it loudly
and publicly and watch how none of the
outlets that normally cover me
is going to cover it now can you think
of any other major story
that someone as prominent as i am and
i'm not you know the most prominent
person in the world
but you've you've observed that if i say
something controversial
it's definitely in the news right
if i say something that gets me a little
bit off the you know off the path
it's news every time it's not news
everywhere
but there's always some you know
liberal-leaning
publication that'll say ah this idiot is
saying x
and i predicted that i would say the
most outrageous thing you could possibly
say
which is a major story was fake news and
a hoax and that i could back it up and
it's obvious
that it's a hoax and that there would be
no news coverage
and you watched it right did you not
observe
that literally no one touched my comment
no one on on the left who believes that
the charlottesville hoax is real
no no one even mentioned it it's like it
didn't happen
[Music]
coincidence it's not a coincidence
it's not a coincidence at all and if you
think about the
unlikeliness of that prediction
it was very unlikely that i could say
something that
insanely radical and get no coverage on
it whatsoever
and i told you why they can't cover it
now
doubling down joel has now commented on
it and
i think he might be writing something
about it but again
he's a very prominent person in the
political world
breitbart is a prominent publication and
when he says in public that chris cuomo
is lying
lying he called him a liar
do you think that chris cuomo will
respond
now normally what would happen if
somebody reports news
and someone else prominent calls them
out and says you're you're literally
a liar what would be the normal response
of the person who's being called a liar
they would respond right you're not
going to see it
so i predict that you will not see
something
like a a real response yeah there might
be like a brush back or something
but i don't think chris cuomo
can respond in any way because if he
does
it's going to bring attention to the
accusation
and the accusation is so much stronger
than the fake news that you don't that
he's not going to be able to survive
even the conversation and when i say
survive i mean
in terms of his interpretation of the
world
so watch so watch for the dog that
doesn't bark
watch out loudly and often we can say
the obvious statement that the
charlottesville
reporting is fake news and a hoax and
the most dangerous thing that's ever
happened in this country
in my opinion so dangerous in fact
that i was wondering if there could be a
class action suit
against cnn now i'm very much against
class action suits and lawsuits i just
think it's a
it's a horrible world to live in you
know i don't want to get any and
so therefore i i typically resist
suing anybody i've never suited anybody
by the way in my whole life i've never
sued anybody
i don't think yeah i've never seen
anybody um
it's because i just don't like the whole
don't like it to happen to me don't let
it happen other people
don't like to be involved in lawsuits
there's just almost always a better way
to handle this stuff
but from a a legal perspective
i wondered you see how dangerous it is
to go outside uh wearing
a trump hat you know just a
any kind of a pro-trump shirt or a magic
hat or anything
and you've seen how dangerous that is
you've seen how it could affect your
career you've seen how it could affect
your safety
now what's the biggest
cause of that lack of safety
well i would say unambiguously the
biggest cause
is the charlottesville hoax because it's
not it doesn't live alone there are lots
of accusations against this president
for you know every manner of thing but
all the rest of them
are a little bit thin so for example
would say well what about when he
announced
he announced he was running and he said
that mexicans are rapists and murderers
well even the people who were worried
about that
certainly understand that that was
hyperbole
and that he did not mean that the women
and children coming across the border
were also rapists you know no reasonable
person
could look at that statement and assumed
that he thought they were all racist
and nobody assumes that that was the one
time he didn't use hyperbole
if somebody uses hyperbole all the time
and that's the most ordinary explanation
for what happened during that
during his announcement it was a little
more hyperbole he made the
he made the risk of people coming across
the border sound
a little higher than you've heard it
before normal hyperbole
so you know when you see stuff like that
you know it's not enough it's not enough
to create the the bubble of fear
and and just the the crazy stuff that
the anti-trumpers are thinking
it's the charlottesville hoax that's
that's the king of all the hoaxes it's
the one that people think
this one we don't have to wonder about
because we heard it in his own words
that's what people think about the
charlottesville hoax they believed they
heard something racist
that was contemporary meaning current
and in his own words and unambiguous
this time those other things you could
see the argument you could say
okay maybe i'm taking this out of
context
but with charlottesville people said
this one seems
just too obvious it's his own words it's
being reported everywhere it's his own
words
how could i be wrong that's what makes
it a hoax
because it was out of context it was a
hoax
and it's the big one it's the mother of
all hoaxes
the charles charlottesville hoax is the
mother
of the smaller hoax it's the mother
of the covington hoax it's the mother of
all hoaxes
and it's the one that is the most
resistant
to any kind of reason uh i just
i just had a back and forth with
somebody here on
on twitter and oh i wish i could maybe i
can find it
because i wanted to show you what
happens when you expose someone who
believes
in the charlottesville hoax when you
when you show them the actual quotes and
the context
and then you tell them it's obvious that
he wasn't talking about
um the neo-nazis as being fine people
what happens to somebody if you watch my
twitter exchange that was this morning
they will devolve into word salad
and i if you should see it just for
entertainment and education purposes
um it's on my twitter feed this morning
it's somebody i was
going back and forth with watch what
happened to his last couple of tweets
they actually don't even make sense
their their words
and they form something like a paragraph
but they're actually just nonsense
and if some did some of you see it if
there's anybody on here who
witnessed that i'd just look for a
confirmation that he did devolve
a word salad is when you have words in
the sentence
but they stop having meaning they just
fit together as words but they don't fit
together with meaning
yeah so you're seeing you've seen some
people confirm now
that uh he devolved into actual babel
just babel now the babel is when you
know you've
and by the way i'm not making this next
part up when you get that kind of
babble irrational word salad answer
it means somebody has been pushed into
cognitive dissonance
as a trained hypnotist i've seen this
many many times if you're new to it is
shocking and you might misinterpret it
you might look at it and say ah he must
be just a troll and when you you got him
with your logic he's
trying whatever he can and maybe that's
part of it but
it's it's a classic signal
for someone who's trying to get out of
their mental prison
but they can't they hit a wall and they
they just degenerate into word salad
so let me let me give you an argument
here
for my interpretation of the
charlottesville situation
versus the hoax interpretation
my interpretation was that the president
went on television
and said that there are good people on
both sides of the statue
debate this makes perfect sense
because he's actually said he's in favor
of keeping the statues
and if any side was bad that was going
to be the side that you thought
had a problem right the people who want
to keep the statues
i'm not in favor of keeping statues i
think they're offensive
but that i'm just giving you that as
background so you know my own bias
but since he has been publicly in favor
of statues
you would think that he would say well
they're good people on both sides of the
statue question because he is one of
those people
in his own mind he's a good person don't
you think
don't you think that the president
thinks he's a good person
don't you think that he thinks his his
buddies his advisors who also want to
keep the statues
the writers the people on the right who
want to keep them don't you think that
the
president actually thinks they're good
people of course he does
and that's that there's no mind reading
involved in that that's sort of an
obvious statement right nobody would
really disagree with that
so my interpretation is completely
normal
and consistent with everything we've
seen before
and everything we saw after because he
specifically
condemned the neo-nazis and the racists
when asked to clarify
so the normal explanation is completely
normal
completely consistent with the past fits
all the data
completely consistent with his
clarification later and everything he's
done since then
now let's look at the hoax
interpretation
here's what you need to know
here's what you need to believe is true
in order to buy into the hoax
that the president went on live tv and
said racists were fine people
you'd have to believe first of all that
my more obvious
and normal explanation is the wrong one
so so right away you're on shaky ground
right
because there's a normal explanation
that explains all the debt all the data
yeah you'd have to agree that you'd have
to believe
that he cited against his own family
um let me put it this way
here's a quote for you if you if you
want to if you want to quote me later
here here's the uh the pull quote
i wrote it down so i'd say say it right
the only difference between antifa and
the neo-nazis
who were at charlottesville the only
difference
well not the only difference let me say
it again
a big difference between antifa
and the neo-nazis at charlottesville is
which members of the trump
family they wanted to kill
the big difference between antifa
and the neo-nazis marching in
charlottesville
is which members of the trump family
they wanted to kill
now i would say that probably the antifa
people
would have loved to see bad things
happening to the president
and probably to you know jared
because he's central to the you know
administration
whereas the neo-nazis would be more
about deporting
ivanka and jared and the president's
grandchildren
so where the neo-nazis would also want
to kill trump's grandchildren
antophar would only want to kill trump
himself
and maybe maybe ivanka and jared
so the big difference between them is
which members
of the trump family they wanted to kill
now cnn is reporting that the president
said there were good people on both
sides
do you believe that the president of the
united states went on television and
said well
here's two groups they want to kill
different parts of my family
one wants to kill you know me and jared
and maybe ivanka
and then the other side wants to kill
doesn't want to kill me
but definitely wants to kill uh you know
jared and my grandkids
but i'm not sure about ivanka because
she's converted so
yeah but in both cases both sides want
to kill members of my family
cnn is reporting that the president said
they're fine people in both of those
groups
does that sound reasonable does that
sound like something he thought
don't think so
in order to believe the charlottesville
hoax you would have to believe that the
president
consciously went on television
and thought to himself i think i'll say
some good things
about the racists marching with tiki
torches
does that sound reasonable does that
sound even
a little bit reasonable now and even if
you believe that
then you have to believe the second part
that the next day when he was asked to
clarify he unambiguously clarified
that he disavows completely
completely disavows the racists and the
neo-nazis
so now you'd have to believe if you're
going to buy into the charlottesville
hoax
that this was the one time the one time
that we know of maybe you can think of
another but i think it's the one time
that trump changed his opinion because
it was unpopular
how often does that happen do you
believe that this president
if he had really held those views that
people imagined he held
you think you wouldn't say that a second
time
do you think that he would have backed
off of that that's not the president
you're watching
the president you're watching doesn't
give a flying
f what you think of his opinion
if he said it once he would say it again
if he said something that sounded
ambiguous and then he clarified it
to be completely consistent with
everything he's ever said on the topic
completely consistent
that should mean something all right
in order to believe the charlottesville
hoax you would have to also believe
that he was sending a secret dog whistle
by completely disavowing that group
now what kind of a secret dog whistle do
you send
when the the ambiguous statement
you know there's an ambiguous statement
and then he clarifies it and he
clarifies it
as clearly as possible that he
completely
disavows the racist and the neo-nazis
is that a dog whistle because that's
like a really bad
dog whistle you know here
here's let me give you an example
if i wanted to dog whistle my approval
of you
would i call you ugly and stupid
so if i said bob is ugly and stupid
would you say to yourself oh there's
that secret dog whistle i think he's in
love with bob
i think he and bob got a little going on
here because he just called him ugly and
stupid
well yeah
you know where's this this dog whistle
that we keep hearing about
the next thing you'd have to think about
in order to believe the charlottesville
hoax
you would have to also believe that
israel didn't notice
that they didn't notice or somehow that
they didn't mind
that the president of the united states
was backing
the anti-semites marching in
charlottesville do you think israel
would give him a pass on that if it were
true
do you think israel believes cnn's
reporting
do you think netanyahu sees cuomo
saying watching you know reporting that
the president praised
the people who were marching with
anti-semitic statements do you think
netanyahu watches that and said oh yeah
that's real news
not a chance there isn't the slightest
chance
that israel thinks that news is true
is israel stupid no evidence of that
does it does israel have a really
fine-tuned
sensor for detecting anti-semitism
i think they do i think they've had some
practice
and if they don't see it who do you
trust
on a question of is something
anti-semitic
do you trust israel or cnn
one of them is credible on that question
you would have to also believe if you
believed in the charlottesville hoax
you would have to believe that the 60
million
trump supporters are okay with it
you'd have to believe that 60 million
people
would be okay in this country with the
sitting president
praising white supremacists marching
saying anti-semitic things
60 million of them who somehow didn't
notice
this now if you told me
a million people believed it in a hoax
i'd say oh yeah a million people believe
anything but 60 million
and you can't find probably anybody in
that group
who believes he actually called the
racist fighting people
60 million none of them noticed
none of them noticed right
let's see
[Music]
all right so that's my point
now having completely demolished the
idea
that the president called the
charlottesville
nazis fine people
do you think this will become a story
nope it won't i will be completely
ignored
uh and they will just wait they'll wait
a few weeks and then they'll report it
again like it's fact
um but wait for this
if you see any kind of response i don't
even say that because there's no chance
you won't see any kind of response
but if you did see a response it would
be
word salad so that's my prediction
prediction is you'll either see no
response
or you'll see one that is word salad in
other words it just
it'll be words that fit together but
they don't they don't quite mean
anything
um
all right
see you next north korea flame story
yesterday vanished
after you said it i don't remember what
that was
say something bad right next to it and
get in trouble
yeah that's that's an interesting
technique so somebody's suggesting that
i
pair my statements about the
charlottesville hoax
with something that's just so horrible
they have to cover it
um
oh yeah so we're going to see some more
michael cohen uh
statements that
who knows you know you know anonymous
unnamed sources are saying they know
what michael cohen's going to say
to congress michael cohen is literally
famous for being an incompetent liar
who will say whatever he needs to say to
uh
you know to further his interests so
it's going to be interesting because
he almost certainly is going to come up
with some damaging
stuff about trump and
it's going to be so not believable and
it makes me wonder especially in the
context of the
the smaller thing in the covington thing
i wonder if cnn
is just going to get their ass kicked
for even reporting it
i guess everybody has to report it
because it'll be public and it'll be
news
but it's got to be an uncomfortable
situation
because i think they're going to know
that it's not
credible but how do they treat it in the
context of all the fake news lately all
right that's all i got to say for now
and i will talk to you all later
