there we go it allowsu said many years
ago he said watch your thoughts because
your thoughts become words watch your
words because your words become actions
watch your actions because they become
habits habits become your character and
your character is Destiny
now I'm going to update this Lao Zoo
was a very smart guy apparently but he
was smart before we discovered how to
make AI work
so there's something we have to update
on this
words and thoughts
turns out of the same thing
whoops so AI taught us the large
language models that all you have to do
is look at the pattern of words
and if you applied the right technology
to it just the word use alone would
produce intelligence
but before that we imagined we had some
kind of you know reason and thoughts and
stuff that was independent from our
words
but AI kind of put the lie to that which
is something by the way hypnotists have
known forever
hypnotists know that the words
are what are activating you
the thoughts are really word
combinations
because we think in words
right your thoughts right now your
private thoughts are in words if you
were to change those words
what would happen
well if you change the words so I'm
going to treat you words and thoughts as
one thing because AI taught us that
right so if you change your words you're
going to change your actions because
that's how you're built
that's the only way it can work
the things you do are literally based on
the frequency and combination of words
in your programmer your head your brain
so to reprogram a person from something
sub-optimal to something that they would
want
all you do is change the frequency
and arrangement of words
do you know what this is called
if you change the frequency and
arrangement of words and and what you're
doing is trying to change somebody's
actions what's what's that called
wordsmithing no
reframing yes could be hypnosis that's
exactly what hypnosis is
hypnosis is not a lot of people if they
watch movies they think it's about the
watch this clock they think it's about
the voice of the hypnotist it's not the
voice
it's not the mannerisms although those
those are helpful parts of the process
it's actually the frequency
and the arrangement of words
that's hypnosis
that's it
that's enough to change somebody's
entire brain and their actions their
habits their character and then their
destiny
so if you could optimize the words in
your head
blah blah blah let me give you a real
concrete example the other day I was
showing this to somebody
and the person said that they they were
working on a problem they had a fear of
rejection
right there there was considering doing
something it was somebody considering an
action which would have been almost
certainly good for them right a very
obvious you know just a really obvious
thing to do that would be good for you
but couldn't get the action right
because of the fear of rejection
that ladies and gentlemen is word
poisoning you say to yourself well
there's some bad thoughts there no words
are thoughts
words and their combinations
and their frequency
is your thoughts there's no difference
once you get that
you unlock this power
until you understand that your words are
a programming language that you can
change on your own
you can't you don't have access to the
stack
right and then what I heard when I heard
the person say to me fear of rejection
I had this thought
I don't use that word for anything
anything
I'm never going to let that word in my
head
when I heard it I I like I recoiled I
recoiled the actual word hurt me
it was like I don't want that in my
head
I will never use that word
because I don't want to
stop myself from acting
do you know what I say in those
situations
this is going to be great
this would be great because keep in mind
that in all of the situations I'm
talking about mine or anybody else's
people know what they're supposed to do
am I right don't people almost always
know what they're supposed to do
it's just hard to do it
and the reason it's hard is because you
don't have your words right if the words
in your head is the word rejection
you're not going to do this whatever it
is if the word in your head is this is
going to be great this will be excited
this will be interesting by the way
curiosity is one of the best replacement
words
if you have some negative words and you
want the easiest way to replace them
replace them with curiosity words I
wonder what's going to happen well this
will be interesting I am fascinated
about how today is going to turn out
you put those words in your head you're
going to act you put the r word in your
head I'm not even going to say it again
because it's such a damaging word
or the f word
f-a-i-l nope not when I say it's not my
vocabulary I mean that I have
consciously made sure that if it comes
up it's not about me
as you know I'm talking about a system
failure or something like that
all right so
how many of you are sold on this as a
good way of understanding the world
just just give me a a halfway point
is this a good way to understand
what you see
all right I think most of you say yes
got one now all right so now I'm gonna
so hold on to this thought that words
not thoughts
words are what unlock habits okay words
and the combination of words is the only
thing that unlocks habits not thoughts
just the words
if you don't get that you don't get
anything
right
now let's explain the world
this by the way would apply to
other people more generally but I'm
going to give you a specific problem
so we have a problem let's say you're uh
let's say you're a black kid and you
want to succeed in this world and you
want to do it the way everybody succeeds
the way everybody succeeds is they
imitate people who have successful
patterns
so you look for somebody who's
succeeding and you say what are you
doing to succeed and then you try to do
that that's how everybody does it
everybody everywhere now every once in a
while you might produce a Steve Jobs
right Steve Jobs does seem magical it's
like he was inventing things that other
people copied
now I don't think he actually invented
anything but he was better at noticing
patterns so he might be you know like a
real exception where he's inventing
patterns as opposed to following them
but the rest of us follow we would
follow him right she'd say what did you
do all right let's do more of that
but because we have an industry that
tells you that well these all have
something in common the Dei the CRT the
ESG one thing they have in common is the
words
that there were slaves
there are systemic racism
there's black and there's white
and that there is a oppressor class and
an oppressed class
those would be you know that's an
example of the words right so don't
think too hard about the specific words
but you would agree
that all of these uh ideas these
Concepts
are built on words
you agree so far it's a it's a word
related set of thoughts as everything is
so these are not these are not uniquely
about words
any three-letter Concepts I put here
would also be supported by their sets of
words
these sets of words create what I call
the glass imitation ceiling
meaning that if you're a young black kid
and you're asked to imitate successful
people
you're going to be looking at the people
that you have been taught or your
oppressors
who can do that who could imitate their
oppressors
I couldn't
if you said the only way you can succeed
is by imitating your oppressors or a
life of crime
I'd pick the crime
I would
I'm just being honest if you put me in
that same situation the the mental
emotional
impact of having to imitate my oppressor
there's just no way I do it
I would I would take up a life of crime
before I did that so that's the
situation you're putting black kids in
and again if anybody's new to me I'm
never talking about all black kids I'm
never talking about all white people
anything I'm never talking about all
black people anything or all anybody
anything
people are amazingly different from each
other
but this is just a good conceptual
framework so here's what I think has to
be fixed uh Black Americans have an
imitation ceiling they simply can't do
the things that other people would do
but
the tools are all there
the tools are there I mentioned my book
had it failed almost everything and
still went big my new one that is also
coming out I think this week if the last
technical Parts work with the online
publishing but
those would be two examples of books
that would tell anybody how to succeed
because I've organized the words in the
books
to make that happen
the books are also hypnosis in the sense
that they're built they're built to be
persuasive as well as you know
utilitarian so
how do you fix this
I'm going to tell you I have no idea I
have no idea how to fix it the only
thing I'm sure of
is that it has to be fixed by the people
who are involved
which is not me
this is something that can't be fixed
from the outside no matter how good your
intentions are no matter how good your
skill is
and no matter anything it doesn't matter
how many resources you have there are
some things that have to be fixed from
the inside
and I feel like every time you put
outside pressure
on a group that's already in a say
victim an oppressor model
that outside pressure
depending on who it comes from let's say
it comes from somebody like me
is it helping
I don't know I I don't have a good
argument that would say it would help
might actually make it worse
so somehow Black America needs to figure
this out
you know how do they either create
enough black successful people or
stories about them so that young black
kids have lots of role models that they
can imitate but
this is the basic setup
you don't know how much your problem is
systemic racism until you deal with the
fact that people are not pursuing
individual success
because they feel like it's denied to
them or where it's it would be
unpleasant to copy somebody
that's my understanding of the world did
it help
