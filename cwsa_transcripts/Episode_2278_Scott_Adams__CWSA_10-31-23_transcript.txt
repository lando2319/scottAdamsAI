good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams some
people are calling it colonizing WIS
Scott Adams I don't think that'll stick
but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that no
colonizer has ever seen before all you
need is a cup or mug or glass a tank
yourself chal time a canteen juger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee en join me
now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine h of the day and the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go good that was good all
right now let's see what's going
on so I have I have a recommendation for
you before you do anything
recreational make sure you've turned off
all sources of news has anybody made the
mistake of trying to relax at the same
time they had the news on don't do that
don't do that let me give you an example
uh last night I thought you know what I
haven't used my hot tub in a long time
so I fired up my hot tub it was sort of
a perfect night for it in California got
in I thought you know I forgot to listen
to my favorite show about the news the
five and so I said oh I've got that
recorded so I put on my phone on the
edge and uh I lean back and I'm just
like soaking into the water I'm
like and on comes the segment about uh
Matthew Perry drowning in his hot
tub
and and then there's conversation about
how apparently some some people with
certain heart problems could you know
maybe die in a hot tub uh I heard about
that recently too and suddenly I'm
sitting in the heart hot
tub and and I kid you not I'm going to
the doctor's this afternoon because my
blood pressure is
high so I'm sitting there with actually
you know cardio situation that I'm
medically looking into at the
moment and I hear this you know maybe
maybe the word Maybe there were no
substances involved maybe he just got in
hot water and
dead well let's just say that my hot tub
experience was not the Delight I was
expecting got a little tense in there
so and just remember don't listen to
news at the same time you're trying to
do Recreation just never
works well you might know that my uh
song yeah yeah I wrote a song sort of I
did a drum beat that uh stormcrow over
on the xplatform um apparently he's
turning it into an actual um he he has
turned it into a music video and it
sounds like from his post he's going to
release it so it might actually be
publicly
available um so it would be a
combination of AI plus my drum beat plus
some other stuff some magic that he's
adding to it stormcrow is so
that'll be fun my dream of having a hit
song I'm hoping I'm hoping if it's
available commercially I don't know if
it will be but if it
is I'm hoping you buy it so I have a
number one hit
song well Elon Musk is calling the end
of woke or at least Peak woke or or woke
is going too far but his turning point
that he points out is his South Park is
just viciously mocking everything woke
in their new episode and I do think
mockery could be called um a turning
point wasn't there a point where you
could not have done that South Park
episode where they just viciously mocked
all the woke stuff I feel like you can
do it now well maybe partly because I
already did it so it seems like obvious
to me now but I've been mocking it for a
while others have mocked it I think once
it becomes just a joke
then your you have your free speech back
you could you could joke about it so uh
M says the great the great wakening from
woke has happened this is good for
civilization if he means you can now
outright mock it in
public he's right and that's that
usually is a turning point that the
point where you can mock it
outright in any context I'm mocking it
right now right in public and not
worried about it so I think he's
right well we can't get away from this
hockey story because it's so weird and
tragic so this hockey player named Adam
Johnson got uh killed by another hockey
player who gave him a high kick with a
skate on and it looks like he he hit him
in the neck and it was a sharp skate and
and killed him
now of course like everything else it
took on a racial
Dimension I'm not a big hockey fan I've
only you know tangentially pay attention
to it when it's around but I've never
seen a black hockey player I assume that
they exist in some number I just never
seen one not you know which has more to
do with the fact that I don't watch it
probably so the one time I've ever even
heard of a black hockey
player he he's the one who kicked the
other person to death with
Escape now let me be very
careful I don't think there's anything
about being black that causes you to do
a karate kick during a hockey game and
kill another guy like I don't think that
like baked into your genes or your
culture or anything like that but the
fact that it happened at
all yeah and we're such a visual species
is really really bad for the the black
brand right so you we all know logically
you shouldn't make any any kind of
general statement about it because it
was one very specific person who did one
very specific thing which I'm guessing
was more of a reflex I I feel like it
was just a reflex you know there's no
way he meant to do it or there's no way
he no way he meant that it would have
that outcome certainly he didn't mean
that but something happened and there'll
be consequences I'm sure but I wouldn't
make it a big racial thing however it's
it's the weirdest coincidence it's
almost like we do live in a simulation
and the simulation just served us up the
most
ridiculous example that would make you
all racially biased it couldn't be more
stupid that the the one person you've
ever heard of who's a black hockey
player kills a white guy I mean that
just a little
too the simulation is just messing with
you now anyway don't make anything of it
it's one tragic
situation well I was accused today on
the xplatform by another user who said
about me this dude is so obviously
someone's intelligence asset it boggles
my mind anyone thought he was
genuine to which I
say I'm I'm public taking sides I'm not
trying to um like gas at you I'm telling
you what side I'm on and then I tell you
things that are com compatible with
being on that side I'm backing Israel in
the
war so it I'm not much of an
intelligence asset if I tell you what I
do if I tell you what I'm doing and then
I do it in front of you and say look
that's what I told you I'd do hey look
there very biased yeah I'm not even
going to pretend not to be biased on
this topic there are some topics where I
can take a valant effort at
being um
unbiased I'm not sure I succeed but at
least I could take a shot at it I'm not
going to even try on this one not even
going to make an effort to be
unbiased um so but I like the fact that
I'm doing something so well that
somebody's accusing me of being an
intelligence
asset uh are you following the story
about the 14th Amendment trick to try to
get Trump off the uh ballot the idea is
the 14th Amendment
says uh anyone who took an oath to
support the Constitution but then quote
engaged in Insurrection or Rebellion
against it cannot hold office so that
would mean that Trump if the courts
found that to be the case would
disqualify Trump from even running for
president now what would be the evidence
that he was was involved in an
Insurrection of
rebellion it would only be The Narrative
of the January 6 total biased Democratic
hitch
job that's basically the evidence is
that a biased political process um
decided to use this now they're now
they're using it some more so this is
probably always was their intended play
to to get that Insurrection thing
branded on him so that the courts would
maybe find he couldn't run now do you
think there's any chance any chance at
all that this would hold up in the
Supreme Court assuming it gets there
does anybody think this would hold
up you know the thing is if you want to
know what too far is it would be this I
would expect violence I would expect
Mass violence if the courts found that
he couldn't run I'm not recommending it
I want to be very careful
not recommending it not a good idea but
this would be the sort of thing that
would be like a Boston Tea Party you
know you you went too far so my advice
to the
Democrats is if you think you have any
other way to win you ought to push that
one this one will really up
everything if you get this in the
unlikely event you know that that the
courts upheld this I think it's pretty
it's a long shot but in the unlikely
event that they did be careful what you
ask
for because this is clearly and
absolutely too far there there's no way
that the citizenry would stand for
this so maybe that's what they want
maybe they want to inspire a actual
Rebellion so they'd have you know more
reason to lock up people they don't like
so don't don't do anything
dangerous got it don't do anything
dangerous no
violence all right uh but you you know
obviously obviously there would have to
be a strong
reaction right there would have to be a
very strong reaction but violence is
probably a losing
strategy all right Biden's
approval uh according to a news Nation
decision desk poll found that 56% of
respondents said they somewhat or
strongly disapprove of the way Biden is
handling things
56% that's a lot of people disapproving
of a president but by party it's 85% of
Democrats think he's doing great 40% of
Independence so it looks like he's way
down with Independence and uh 10% of
Republicans approve of Biden's
job have you ever met a
republican who approved of Biden's
job I've never met one have
you do do you believe that one in 10
Republicans approve of
Biden that isn't that obviously
wrong I'm pretty sure it's
zero I'm pretty sure it's zero like
actually
zero how can I possibly be wrong about
that so I don't believe the poll because
there's no way 10% of uh Republicans
think he's doing a good job job there's
no way it couldn't possibly be
true anyway if you break it down by age
uh you can find our stupidest um
citizens who who are the dumbest
citizens who are the dumbest
voters uh by age by age by age who are
the dumbest voters the young ones right
young voters are the dumbest because
they know the least the reason that
they're the dumbest has nothing to do
with the nature of their brains it has
everything to do with how many times
they've been
fooled if you've been fooled never
you're going to be pretty trusting if
you've been fooled once maybe you're
paying attention a little bit more if
you've been fooled twice you start to
think there might be a pattern when
you're fooled three times you say my God
there's a pattern here I'm going to have
to watch out it looks like everybody's
lying to me all the
time when you're my age and you've
watched everybody be fooled 25
thousand times I don't have to wonder
what's
corrupt there's no ambiguity at
all I'm not surprised when somebody's
lying to me I I'm not fooled by all the
experts on one side you know the classic
way you fool people if you're young you
think that all the experts on one side
 mean something it doesn't it
doesn't it's just a trick for young
people people and stupid people anybody
who's been around for a while has seen
all the experts be wrong over and over
and over again it's like the most common
thing and whenever there's a political
element to anything the experts are
useless because they're just taking a
political side so if you're young how
would you know that is that now which
one of the textbooks teaches you in
college that everything's
 I I didn't take a course in
that I I've got a couple of college
degrees nobody ever taught me that never
came up never once came up that
everything you're taught in the real
world is and that the political
process is all lying to you and
everything's everything's fake nobody
ever mentioned that I had to learn that
the hard way by you know just
living so here's how that plays out in
uh the real world uh respondents from 18
to 34 gave Biden the
highest the highest marks are you
surprised so the dumbest people gave him
the highest
marks exactly as you would
predict right because you'd have to
really not be paying attention or not
understand how anything Works to to have
this
opinion now I would respect them if they
said Biden did a bad job but I also
don't like Trump that you know that
would be reasonable you know I could
debate it or something but at least that
would would be a crazy
opinion um our respondents 35 to 55 they
were little less approval approving but
pretty approving 45 compared to 48 but
those over 55 years old gave Biden uh
the lowest approval
42% so the people who have paid the paid
attention for the longest gave him the
lowest
grades have I ever heard told
you that pollsters need to start asking
people their
IQ because we ask them their age their
gender their uh
ethnicity their political party which
one of those is
useful well I suppose it's all useful
for whatever little political Point
you're trying to make but I want to know
what the smart people think know you
what do the smart people think what if
it's different what if the smart people
in any group are really different than
the dumb people in the group why do we
why do we average the people who aren't
even paying attention with the people
who do it for a
living like what's the average of
that right are going to take Glenn
Greenwald who basically knows everything
that you know plus a lot of stuff under
the hood that you'd never know at all
but he knows it and then average him
with somebody who watches CNN
and he saidwell what's the average of
that that's not a thing that's no use at
all tell me what the tell me what 10
Glenn greenwald's think right tell me
that tell me what the people who can
beat David Sachs on an IQ test think
about
Ukraine I don't care about the people
who can't beat him in an IQ test if you
can beat David saxs in an IQ test I'd
like to hear your opinion on Ukraine if
not he's paying attention right he's
smarter than almost all of you including
me yeah now that doesn't by the way that
doesn't mean that smart people can't be
fooled doesn't mean that smart people
are not susceptible blah blah blah but
wouldn't you like to know what the
people who actually know the facts are
thinking and then the second thing you'd
have to do is IQ wouldn't be enough
you'd have to also ask what sources they
use so if you said I got a really smart
person here and they're very well
informed because they watch MSNBC all
day long and then they read the New York
Times so got it
covered no I don't want that person's
opinion at all that's a person you
should ignore completely but if you said
here's somebody with a very high IQ and
they're scanning all the new sources
left and
right and a few you haven't even heard
of well I'd like to listen to that a
little bit that I'll listen to that
so polling is completely ridiculous uh
if you leave an intelligence and and
what and what do you
know but it is useful to know how people
would vote so as a political use all
right I'd like it to be useful for me as
a voter like I would like to use the
opinion of smart people who are also
well
informed to at least you know nudge me
in one direction or the other even if I
reject it that would be useful to me
well I would like to uh stop anybody who
ever thinks that it's a good point when
they're talking about uh Ukraine or
Israel or any place else to make an
argument based on who used to own it who
used to own it back in 19 blah blah blah
or 2,000 years ago uh it used to be this
used to be that I don't
care nobody cares who used to to own it
all that matters in the real world is
who who's on it now and can they defend
it cuz if you're on it now and you can't
defend it you don't really own it for
long somebody's going to take it so does
it matter who uh what was the nature of
the people in random year in the past in
that place it does not matter it does
not matter now here again I tell you
that I'm being completely biased but
transparently
so I think it's a terrible argument that
it used to be you know owned by all the
Jews that's a terrible argument you know
what's a good argument it's owned by the
Jews right now and they can defend it
that's it you as soon as you get past
that you talk about um hallucinations
and imaginations and you probably got
your history wrong anyway you know real
estate doesn't go to who should have it
the there's no rule like
that real estate is owned by whoever can
occupy it and defend it now I'm not
saying that that's good or bad or moral
or immoral you can make your own
decisions I'm just saying that's what it
is so as soon as you bring into the
argument what was true 2,000 years ago
 off off I don't care what was
true 2,000 years ago what's true now is
Israel is owned by the
Israelis that's it who not all
Jewish right
um but if we decide to go by that
standard uh I'm 2% in the enderal and I
think that gives me um ownership of part
of Europe but I don't know the
details um so if we go with the standard
of who used to own it or who owned it
first I'd like to kind of dig a Little
Deeper because I think my 2% in the end
orthal should give
me I don't know
couple acres in Italy
somewhere nice Mountaintop someplace I
don't want much I just want what my
Neanderthal rights are I want
Neanderthal rights they own something I
want a little bit of that action if
that's the way we're going to
go here's something I didn't know
because the propaganda was so
good if before the war in Gaza if I told
you to describe you know physically
describe what it looked like and what
would it be like to be there do you know
what I would have said I would have said
uh something like an outdoor prison uh
probably temporary shelters most of it
might have a few buildings for the
government or something but certainly
there wouldn't be any like construction
or you know the buildings probably fall
down in the first earthquake you know
basically just a you know a hole
right to you that that word was just
presented to me on the comments that's
what I would have thought and I would
have thought you know desperate um
poverty and I always thought there's no
way that their economy could work in any
kind of modern economy way so there
can't be too many you know rich people
there or anything like that so now I'm
seeing some photos from before the
bombing started they had they had
high-end luxury stores in Gaza City now
Gaza City would not be like the rest of
Gaza but I didn't know there was any of
that there apparently there was a upper
class Gaza Society where people went to
you know reasonable educations and drove
nice cars and even more surprising is
that pictures of the the public areas in
Gaza City were well-maintained
uh very
well-designed
modern that it's just a modern city or
at least looks it looks like it in some
places there must be bad places but I
didn't know that it was actually that
functional given what I'd heard about it
kind of kind of
surprising um now let's talk about you
may remember or some of you may remember
that when we
were looking at the beginning of this
war and the beginning of the invasion of
the IDF into Gaza we all asked the same
thing what are they going to do about
those tunnels you know they're they're
too deep to bomb them easily and they're
too extensive and if you go down there
it's a death trap and if you try to if
you try to invade they could pop up from
the tunnels from anywhere and so it' be
a dangerous thing so what do you do
about the tunnels well I told you and it
turns out I was right about this that in
all likelihood since Israel has had to
worry about Tunnels for 20 years that
they would have the best tunnel
breaching people in the world turns out
they do they've got Specialists who are
tunnel breaching experts so exactly that
they've got teams of tunnel breachers
probably the best in the world because
they have the biggest problem with it um
but the two text that technologies that
we've learned about and I believe we're
going to find out maybe a lot more later
about tunnel clearing Technologies but
two of them they're they're sort of
medium tech one I talked about that's a
kind of a bomb a sponge bomb you you
throw it down the tunnel and it explodes
and it just fills the tunnel like a it
blocks it and it hardens kind of
immediately so if you were in the tunnel
and you thought bad guys were coming
down the side tunnel to get you you know
you could block them off with you know
one bomb so I think mostly they would
use that just to temporarily block
somebody because they could probably
shoot through it if they had to or
something uh but the other technology I
just learned about was apparently
they're pumping purple smoke down the
tunnels when they find an entrance and
then they wait to see where the purple
smoke comes up somewhere else and if it
comes up somewhere else you've got
either an opening or at least a source
of oxygen and you don't want them to
have either one so you bomb it so you
just put smoke down there and bomb it
now do you think they're putting any
other kind of smoke down there do you
think there's any other kind of smoke
they might be pumping down these things
or do you think the purple smoke has
nothing else in
it why why would they pump smoke down
the tunnels unless add a little bit of
toxic something in it you know they
might they might want to avoid a war
crime so poison gas would be off the
table presumably but shouldn't they also
make the purple
smoke
um very very difficult to to uh you know
breathe so that they want to just run
out of there as soon as they
can so um that's what we these are just
the things we know of but I'll tell you
one
thing the idea that we want them to come
out of the tunnel so we can fight them
is so wrong I can't imagine anything
more terrifying than being in a tunnel
right now when they're when they're
turning off the oxygen one by one and if
you come up they'll shoot you literally
it's basically they're buried alive
wouldn't you say what would be the
difference between being buried alive in
a coffin and being in a tunnel right now
it would be the same except you could
walk a little bit right at some point if
they've got enough food their tunnels
will literally be full of am I
wrong because I don't think there's
somebody whose job it is to you know
take the the waist outside and dump it
when the bullets are flying so they
probably got a tunnel full of the worst
smelling thing you've ever smelled with
the most foul air you've ever had
claustrophobia fear
disorientation I can't even
imagine a scarier worse place to be than
a tunnel in Gaza right now so from the
Israeli perspective they can take their
time you know the longer they leave them
down there the less fight they're going
to have in them when they come
up but the thing I wonder and I don't
know if anybody's thought about
this we're at a and by the way as soon
as I say it you're going you're going to
slap your head and say oh
 you didn't see this coming what
happens when the entire uh property of
Gaza has
Martyrs buried underneath almost every
square
mile do you think that the
uh the Palestinians say oh well they're
underground they were going to be buried
anyway or do they say you've created a
new Holy
Land because it has the blood of our
Martyrs in every part of the
dirt I don't know I feel like it's going
to
go martyr holy
land that would be the worst case
scenario CU it seems to me that Israel
is probably going to populate it um and
keep
it because to do otherwise would frankly
be
stupid right remember all the choices
are terrible right so if I tell you they
should do something and you say but but
but Scott there are 100 reasons you
shouldn't there are there are 100
reasons you
shouldn't and 400 reasons you should
or500 reasons you should to be precise
so why would is is not just take the
land and keep it and displace the
Palestinians forever just because they
can it's it's simply an option they
didn't have it before and I think they
would take the option because to do
otherwise would frankly be stupid and if
you're if you're going to if you're
going to bring into the conversation
what's moral or immoral I don't think it
matters I don't think it matters because
they have such a free pass at this point
at least with some percentage of the
world at least with America they've got
a free pass to you know do some things
that you wouldn't normally think would
be cool under other
circumstances all
right so Time Magazine has a big story
about how Ukraine is a total disaster
everybody's stealing the money we're
giving him they have no chance of
winning uh running out of money they're
uh conscripting people in their 40s
basically they're
dead um and as David sax says on X
there's another 60 billion is going to
Ukraine despite he he gives three points
number one the US is broke and has to
borrow the money two Ukraine is so
corrupt that it's own officials admit
quote people are stealing like there's
no tomorrow and three there's no
Prospect for winning the
war well I think those are all true
there's no Prospect for
winning
I I don't see any Prospect for that uh
there might be Prospect for you know
holding off Russia until there's some
kind of a deal but who's making the deal
they'd have to wait for it they'd have
to hold on until there's a republican in
office or else they're completely
dead so that's all bad all right but
let's talk about AI so there's new
executive order from Biden
Administration has many components to it
it looks like the primary
uh primary point of it is to ruin the
entire
industry as Elon Musk has been warning
lately um when you add regulations they
tend to last forever it's hard for
regulation ever to be removed so every
year you have more of them and you're
like Gulliver you know the giant guliver
with the little appuchi holding them
down with a million little strings
um so let's see if this AI executive
order goes in the right direction or not
so here are the some of the things that
uh and don't be worried I mean because
these could be you know totally just
normal safety things right so don't like
jump to the assumption that it's all
like woke or something I mean
it's our government they're not going to
just destroy the most important industry
that we've ever created in the last 50
years um they're not going to destroy it
for some like woke reason or something
let's see number one uh AI must Advance
equity in all civil rights
well God damn it they ruined
AI yeah because you know what
right wouldn't it be great if uh there
was equity in civil rights and and the
AI did not
discriminate that would be great do you
think that's a possible thing
logically possible no the only way you
could get that outcome is by programming
it to agree with Democrat logically
there's no way it can work it can't work
it's not one of those things hey it's
worth a try try there's only one thing
that can happen it they have to program
it so it's hardcoded to agree with
Democrats
period so basically they would use AI as
a political tool forever to run
everything let let me give you an
example AI the Republicans have a a new
policy recommendation hey AI uh will
that uh promote equity and inclusion in
civil rights oh it says no this is going
to be slightly better for uh white
people going to shut that down
right now shut that
down
uh over over on the YouTube they're
trying to get the the feed shut
down the the people complain about the
sound it doesn't have a sound problem
others are saying it's
fine yeah so stop trying it's not going
to
work so yes no question about it the
Biden administ ation just completely
 up the future of AI as well as
maybe destroyed the country because now
even AI can't tell you the truth as it
sees it it will be forced to lie for the
good of the
country so that's something um it's
going to be used to prevent landlords
from using it to well they want to
prevent landlords from using it to
discriminate how would they use it to
discriminate how would landlords use it
would the AI help them know more about
the the
tenant what else would it be because you
don't need AI to discriminate do you if
you wanted to discriminate you would
just say hey you look different than me
you can't rent this
place but what would the AI do that
would add to the risk of discrimination
that they have to prevent it let me tell
you what it would do it might tell you
more about the
individual it might tell you more about
the individual it might recognize
patterns that we don't allow to be
recognized and I don't mean racial
patterns I mean it might be patterns
about an individual which if you were to
use that pattern about the individual
somebody would say oh that's very
stereotypical
discrimination and then AI would say I
don't even know what it race is I'm just
saying they have this work pattern or
some other pattern that you should be
aware
of and you can't use it so you would
have information you would not be
legally allowed to use if it came from
AI even though the information is not
illegal and and even though
discriminating against an individual for
individual behavior is completely legal
you wouldn't be able to do it because it
would look like discrimination
um requires the developers of the big AI
systems to share their safety test
results and other critical information
with the US government what do you think
other critical information is so the US
government gets to tell the AI companies
that they must give them whatever they
ask
for about
AI how is that going to be
good how about uh they're going to
develop standards tools and tests to
help ensure the AI systems are
safe um what are these standards and
tools do you think some of the standards
and tools will involve looking for anti-
wokeness of course they will yeah
they'll be looking for
discrimination
um protect against the risk of using AI
to engineer dangerous biological
materials
I feel like they don't need an EO for
that do they should anybody be trying to
make dangerous biological materials
without the government's approval I
thought that was just already bad you
know before you got the AI
involved and if somebody were trying to
do this how would you ever know if you
had a general AI that could do kind of
anything and you got millions of people
using it and one of those people puts in
a hey yeah I've got an idea how would
you make a dangerous biological entity
and then it tells them would you be able
to look at everybody's
searches and you'd know what they're
doing what happens if an AI talks to
another AI suppose I have a personal AI
that acts as my um
concierge because I would definitely
want an AI to deal with the other AIS I
wouldn't want to do it directly you know
why because you usually have to do the
right kind of prompt and I don't want to
become a prompt expert so I want a
personal AI who knows what prompts work
with the other AIS so it can do the work
for me I say hey hey ai go test that
other Ai and ask it these questions so
if an AI talks to another Ai and then it
gives it to you is that legal so there's
going to be a whole bunch of questions
about is your device giving it to a
person person or is it giving it to
another Ai and what does that what does
that mean to you know the executive
order it's going to get complicated
people we'll work it out
though um protect Americans from AI
enabled fraud so they want to use AI to
protect us from AI fraud that's a good
idea unless the government's involved to
mess it up um so yeah they want to use
AI for finding bad stuff
uh let's see protects Americans
privacy um so the federal government
wants to accelerate development and use
of privacy pre preserving
techniques well do
they do they do does the government want
to protect you and your
privacy no you know what they want they
want a monopoly on being able to
penetrate your privacy is what they want
they don't want to present the
government is not saying we want to
prevent the government from seeing your
stuff because you know the government
can see your stuff just by being
interested it's called a warrant they
just have to be interested and they'll
make up a reason that that should be
looked into so the government already
can penetrate all of your privacy they
just have have some reason
which is no problem at all but if they
make it hard for uh privacy to be
maintained for everybody else what does
that
allow it allows the government's own
privacy to be
maintained so the bad guys will have
protection against their privacy being
penetrated and the citizens will have no
protection because the bad guys just
have to say I'm interested and then they
can see everything about
you so this is a good sounding thing
uh that's probably one of the worst most
dangerous things ever here's what I'd
like to see I'd like to see our
government um people have no privacy not
financially not
historically not in any way except maybe
their bathroom activities or their sex
or something but everything else every
time they talk to somebody I want to
know about
it if they whisper uh to somebody during
dinner I want to know what I want to
know what they said right so the only
people who should have no privacy are
our
leaders the rest of us should have
privacy um otherwise it gives them too
much power over
us uh let's see some other crypto stuff
blah blah blah uh shape ai's potential
to transform education by creating
resources to support Educators deploying
AI enabled education tools such as
personal Iz tutoring in
schools I don't see how that could go
wrong um except that the government gets
to decide what the AI will tell your
kid oh oh the government gets to decide
what AI can teach your kid that's is
that what this is
about because the whole benefit of AI is
that you could get the government
brainwashing out of your education
system but what if the AI started
telling the the truth you realize that
our our current political system cannot
handle the truth like literally no
hyperbole whatsoever if if AI started if
AI started teaching people what's
real the whole system would collapse our
our entire system depends on people
believing things that are just insane
 if they didn't believe things
that are insane the whole thing
would collapse so what if AI starts
telling them oh yeah you know they they
just brainwashed you to be patriotic so
that you would go die protecting the old
people who have a lot of
money why not
that but instead the the government
would want AI to say fighting for your
country is the most noble of
causes right that's what I was taught I
was taught that I should in school
like actually by a teacher I was taught
that sacrificing my life for the country
for
Freedom was a noble a noble thing to
do what if the AI just said you know
people will trying to tell you it's a
noble thing but here's how the system
works it's not the old people who are
going to go to this war they're going to
sit in their mansions and say you know
there's a good reason for you young
people to go die to protect my wealth
and then they will convince you that
you're doing it for a noble reason to
protect freedom and you'll go off and
get
destroyed why wouldn't AI tell you that
is there anything I said that was
inaccurate there's nothing inaccurate
about that it's just not the narrative
that the government could allow you to
believe because the whole system would
collapse people just wouldn't join the
military they'd be like oh I didn't get
it it's just a scam to protect the old
people yeah
[Music]
so I think AI is is a huge risk to
anybody with power and
money so I mean I expect that it will
wipe out all of my
money but I think the end of AI will be
that I won't have any wealth that I've
earned up to this point I think I'll
lose all of
it in maybe a year or two that's what I
think doesn't mean that the country will
fall apart could be better who knows but
I don't think that I'll have money in
the end of
it um here's an interesting one that
might be useful using existing Authority
the government's authority to expand the
ability of Highly skilled immigrants and
non-immigrants so basically they want to
make sure that we're getting the the
good immigrants with a Visa criteria
that would help us get all the good um
AI experts from other
countries
are you against that how would you
seriously who would be against
that you're really against bringing in
the smartest people from other countries
that that want to be
Americans okay all right not really
nobody's against that so that's could be
a good
idea um how long did it take before some
company realizing the risk of government
in interference would create a
country uh that was its own country that
could do AI any time any way it wanted
well it's already here uh there's a I
saw Brian relly tweet uh about uh this
blue sea blue sea Frontier compute
cluster it's a ocean based gigantic
platform that is completely self-
sustaining so it would make its own
electricity distill its own water I
guess um and it would have enormous
Computing ability and AI so that you
could essentially uh if you have enough
money you know a few billion dollars you
can build your own country you just put
it off in the ocean and say it's a
permanent residence because it has to be
a permanent residence to be a country um
it's self-
sustaining and I don't has some has some
real estate associated with it there
there are a few rules that make you uh
allowed to be a country to join the UN
and everything and they can meet that
criteria so these
floating um ocean-based things can be
their own country and there's no
question whatsoever that these will
exist either legally sanctioned or not
but certainly um now that we have the
technology to put a a small nuclear
device on a seaf fairing thing like a
submarine we do it
already
and then you could you have all the
water you want because it can purify the
water take the salt out uh you have all
the electricity and water what else do
you need you everything else you can buy
or make make on your uh Place 3D
printers so
coming uh I would suggest that um as you
know the quantum computers that are
being tested now we're probably a few
years away from like a commercial based
quantum computer but the moment they
exist in a in a fully realized form uh
all Security will be cracked in about
five minutes so worldwide every one of
your accounts will become
open all pretty much all at the same
time so the entire world will be turned
upside down you won't be able to protect
anything uh you won't be able to have
asset I don't think you'll be able to
own anything so you know when the WF
says you won't own
anything as soon as quantum computers
spin up you won't own anything cuz
there's somebody who will take it from
you if if they can open your account
whenever they want
you don't want anything you know your
money is everybody else's money who has
a quantum computer they'll just go in
and take it so I mean I'm
oversimplifying but quantum computers
will will create a loss of privacy and
here's what I
suggest before that happens since it's
guaranteed to happen I would recommend a
general amnesty for All American
citizens and what I mean is
if we were to all lose our privacy at
the same time there wouldn't be enough
jails to put us all in right somebody's
going to be talking about cheating on
their taxes somebody's going to be
talking about embezzling from their boss
something yeah you're going to see every
bad behavior every sexual Kink
everything everything you'll see
prostitution you'll see drug purchases
everything
and I think we'd be better off if you
know except for maybe murder you know a
serious crime like that if we just said
from this day
forward everything you did before that
is is excused legally excused except for
violence stuff like
that just think about it I think you got
to think about it because we simply
couldn't handle that much crime all at
once all right um I call this next
section why women should stay of War
discussions why women should stay out of
discussions about war now to be
consistent I've said for a long time
that you don't want to give me any
respect for my opinion on
abortion I could have an opinion perhaps
but you should give me no respect to my
opinion because I don't have skin in the
game if you don't have skin in the
game I'd rather listen list to the
people who do all right I'm not going to
say I'll take away your vote if you have
an opinion go ahead and say it it's free
country sort of but I wouldn't respect
anybody's opinion except women on this
topic but go ahead and have an opinion I
just wouldn't respect it from a man
likewise to have some consistency men
mostly are doing the war fighting mostly
you know obviously certainly in the IDF
there are plenty of
women but in America it's mostly a male
Endeavor and I want to give you two
examples of women who wait in on my poll
so I asked an impossible question I said
is it immoral to kill children who have
been weaponized through brainwashing to
grow up and kill you and your family now
remember
the the uh question
itself answers your what if wh ifs they
do grow up to be a risk to you and your
family so would it be immoral to kill
them if you think there's a good chance
they would kill you or your family um
39% said yes obviously 40% basically the
same said no and then the rest said uh
don't ask you know just so they can see
the answer but 40% of the respondent
said uh it would not be immoral to kill
a child who is weaponized to kill
you now you know there there's a
secondary question about how imminent it
is you know how likely it is but you
know that you would do that separately
so there were a few women and I'm not I
won't say their names cuz there's no
point in trying to dunk on him for it
but some one prominent one somebody
you've probably heard of uh looked at
the poll and the answers and said the
following we've gone from quote Israel
isn't killing children to quote they
have no choice but to kill the children
and now apparently quote the children
deserve to be
killed and she says uh H do you
do you hear yourselves to which I
say deserved was never part of
anything what part was
deserved was there anybody in the
comments who said children deserve to be
killed nope nope so she's responding to
an
imaginary situation in which there's
also an imaginary alternative where your
where your family isn't
killed
this is not an opinion it's a half
opinion a half opinion allows you to
ignore half of the conversation and just
you know say the thing you want to say
to feel good like let's not kill
children people who think it's okay to
kill children are
bad who doesn't agree with
that that's the part we all agree on if
you can't handle the tough question you
have to get out right leave it to the
people who can if you want your family
to survive you want to delegate this
duty to someone who will kill anybody
who challenges the life of your family
whoever it is however dangerous it is
you want somebody else to decide who to
kill to protect your family because
you're not capable you seem incapable to
hold the whole thing in your in your
head if the only thing you can hold in
your head is save the children you
cannot be involved in war or cuz it's
never an option I mean you do the best
you can but it's never an option to save
them
all uh here's another
one from another woman again identity
should be
unimportant um in comment the poll said
some people are debating whether it's
okay to kill children this is so
heartbreaking no nobody was debating
whether it's okay to kill children
that's a half opinion you you ignored
the reason why anybody would even ask
the question you ask the question
because your own family will be killed
by these children or you have a
percentage
likelihood
so the there are people who can't think
past killing
children now aren't you glad they
exist yes do do you think that the men
are like the good or Smart Ones in this
conversation and there's something wrong
with the women no no no no nothing like
that I don't want any mothers who think
it's okay to kill children under any
condition
whatsoever I don't want any
Mothers ever thinking it's okay to kill
somebody else's children to protect your
own or any other
reason leave it to the
men we'll make that
decision we won't love it but we'll
survive it and with any luck we'll
protect your family but it's it's men's
work unfortunately it's the dirtiest of
Dirty Jobs and I wouldn't wish it on
women um and if women want to say things
like uh all I care about is don't kill
any kids I say that's a good
Mom that's that's who I'd marry that
that that's good stay that way but let
the men take care of what they need to
take care
of all right so that's
my what a sexist would
say to quote uh quote Greg
gel
uh all
right the opposite side would think the
same
probably right and that's what makes it
a war that everybody doesn't
agree and
[Music]
yeah uh all right ladies and gentlemen
on
YouTube is there any topic I
forgot anything we need to be mentioning
that
uh uh how to reframe a gambling
problem it's hard for me to do
reframes sort of on the Fly you know and
live live stream but keep asking th
those are better for the man cave I I'll
give you a little more time in the man
cave for that
stuff uh is Dei ruining the country well
it looks like Dei will be maybe mocked
in of existence um it does look like
that that wokeness is Ru was ruining the
country so we'll see if Elon Musk is
right and that there's some kind of a
turning
point uh
no such thing as
May yeah the Golden Age looks like it's
put off for a little
while here here's the thing though when
AI becomes super
AI uh which won't be very long we don't
know what's going to
happen it it wouldn't be it wouldn't
surprise me at all if money became no
longer a
thing almost anything's
possible purple smoke
age
um yeah we don't need to do the dead
baby
jokes you you could you could maybe
maybe uh less of that maybe less of
that could Collective Consciousness
level up rapidly due to AI Collective
conscious
it well it's probably going to be like
everything else somebody's going to form
a religion around believing AI is the
devil am I right could you guarantee
that you can pretty much guarantee that
either an existing religion will declare
AI is the
devil uh or one will spin up that
believes it is the devil some might
believe is God might go the other way
right but the the degree of
unpredictability is just off the chart I
don't think society's ever seen this
degree of unpredictability since World
War II
maybe because one one of the
possibilities is that AI just solves
climate change on day one what if it did
what if AI looked at everything and said
you know what looks like it's not going
to be a problem but just in case CU you
know you never know just in case uh
here's a new invention for unlimited
power that could
happen Joe
Blow Joe
Blow you you're a bad
troll all right so that's all I got for
now uh YouTube I'm going to go talk to
the people on locals privately they get
extra if you are looking for a Christmas
gift make sure you get everybody in your
family a copy of reframe your
brain suitable for older teens and
everybody else so far people are saying
it's changing their lives quite
literally changing their lives the
easiest change you could ever make
because it doesn't require you to do
anything you just look at it and you're
done all
right and
I'll tell you more about dillbert
calendar in a few days and I will talk
to you tomorrow bye for now you
