so here's how I see the world
and I would like as my gift to Black
America
to solve all your problems right here
all right
so the American success uh plan is
usually the same if you want to succeed
you first have to get rid of your
obstacles right if you have an obstacle
to success
logically would you how many of you
would agree if you have an obstacle to
success and you want to succeed do you
not need to remove your obstacle first
yes or no
oh somebody says no interesting
interesting it's because you're way
ahead of me isn't it some of you say yes
we'll get to that all right so let's say
you've got obstacles you've got to get
rid of and let's say one of your
obstacles is systemic racism and
systemic racism could be connected to a
bunch of other problems you've got from
poverty to maybe poor nutrition you're
in a crime neighborhood too many drugs
Etc the ETC on this is doing a lot of
work
uh but you also if you if you could
handle your obstacles you can find a way
around them then you'd also have a
strategy and your strategy might be
study continuously build a talent stack
you know learn things all the time it's
always good for Success you'd want to
stay off drugs and obey the law and you
hear again the ETC is doing a lot of
work right you'd want to network you'd
want to you know there's a whole bunch
of things you'd dress right so there's a
whole bunch of things that we could all
name
that would be your strategies for
success now in my opinion and here's
where I'm going to get in trouble
it's great to have free speech if you
ever get a chance to have free speech
like I have that most of you don't it's
really awesome
it's a great feeling to be able to say
whatever you think is true and helpful
all right now I try to use my free
speech just to be helpful and this would
be an example right if you're an Asian
American
do you have any systemic racism
I'd say yes historically most people
would agree yes and do any Asian
Americans come over here with any
problems of poverty and bad nutrition
probably there are plenty of poor people
of all types Etc but in my opinion what
I see is that the Asian American
community
works on their strategies for success
and you know what that does
but what happens if you work on your
strategies and you ignore your obstacles
it removes all your obstacles it removes
your obstacles
because if you've got a really good
skill set nothing's going to stop you
nothing if you're not doing drugs you
stay down to jail and you developed
useful skills that the world wants
nothing's going to stop you no you're
you're soon will fix your own nutrition
your poverty will be fixed your systemic
racism might still be there but you
wouldn't even notice it you slice
through it like it didn't exist
so I believe that the the Black American
strategy for success is accidentally
backwards
accidentally is accidentally backwards
and I believe that we're being we all of
us are being sold an idea that if you
don't remove the obstacles to success
systemic racism being at the Top If You
Don't remove these black Americans are
going to be you know depressed and
suppressed because they won't have the
same level of success
Asian Americans do it the other way
around they get themselves right they
fix themselves
and then all this becomes irrelevant
so this is the biggest thing that black
Americans probably need to imitate
success is mostly imitation
imitation there's no there's no uh
there's no
there's no crime to be imitators right I
learned to be a cartoonist by imitating
other cartoonists right so imitation is
the way to succeed you look at other
people what did they do and then you try
to do that thing
and what works for every person
black Asian American anything else
Hispanic American you name it what works
for everybody is this Barb you do this
part first
you don't ignore the obstacles you know
if there are people who want to be
working on those directly that's great
but if everybody did this you wouldn't
even talk about that it would just
disappear in time
right and that ladies and gentlemen
is my contribution to Black America I
believe that if every black American
took the free assets that are available
and I'm a perfect example uh I could
give you advice on how to do this right
I really could a lot of people could I
write books on it so you can buy my
books and you know how to fail at almost
everything and still win big tells you
exactly and in a pretty easy way
how to do the strategies right to
succeed
Black America
because I have freedom of speech I got
it the hard way but let me tell you if
you do this
work on the strategy first
the other stuff is going to disappear in
importance in a fairly quick period of
time
but if you work on the you know focusing
on the obstacles and you tell yourself
well there's no point in working on
myself because I got all these obstacles
you will be guaranteed to fail and
honestly it's going to be hard to care
it's gonna it's gonna be hard for other
people to care about you right do you
know why Asian Americans never had Asian
American lives matter
because nobody questioned it
wasn't a question nobody even thought
about it of course they do the reason
that black Americans wanted to make sure
that black lives matter is it felt like
they didn't just felt like they didn't
but if you want to make black lives
matter
stop working on this side
that's not how you get there this is a
false path
these are all real things there really
is systemic racism you know I'm a big
believer in it
but you need to ignore it if you want to
personally succeed if you want to
personally succeed work on strategies
the rest of it will become irrelevant
pretty quickly pretty quickly now you
might say to me Scott you're being
simplistic
because the reason you can't work on
those personal strategies is you're
you're in such a bad situation
to which I say that is a loser's
strategy or a loser's philosophy if you
believe you can't because you have
obstacles well then you can't
somebody smart said that once if you
believe you can't you're right
if you believe you can you're probably
right
so this is my contribution I do it at
obviously great personal risk
but I'm in a position where I could do
that and so I thought it was useful and
I only do it because it's useful it
probably looks like I'm trying to get
clicks but not this this is only because
I think it's useful
and that ladies and gentlemen concludes
our presentation for today YouTube I'll
talk to you tomorrow
