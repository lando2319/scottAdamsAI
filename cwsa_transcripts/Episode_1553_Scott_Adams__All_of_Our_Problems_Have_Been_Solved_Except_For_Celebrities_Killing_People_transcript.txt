good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that ever happened to
you
and maybe anybody else it's called
coffee with scott adams and there's a
little thing called the simultaneous set
that's coming up in a moment but i have
to set the stage
have i ever told you how much i hate
sleeping
i'm the only person i know i'm sure
there are others but i hate sleeping
and so
i wake up just naturally quite early i
start work four
four a.m usually it'd be my ideal time
to start work
so last night
i
woke up in bed and i thought to myself
you know
i i think i'm just going to get up
because i was awake
and i didn't really check the clock
because
my internal clock's pretty accurate i
thought that's pretty close to 4 am
give or take
so i got up
it turned out to be 1 45
1 45 is when i woke up this morning
and i was already up and around and
patting the dog and i thought
you two
vet vegas
so
let's just say that the quality of this
live
stream
might be a little bit lower than what
you used to
i'm just trying to set the expectations
but
still
despite all of that
how terrific is it going to be to do the
simultaneous simple it's going to be
amazing you know you use a cupra mug or
a glass of tiger jealous it's not a
canteen junk a flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better
especially your antibodies it's called
the simultaneous sip and it happens now
go
um i don't know about you but sometimes
if you're leaning
when you have the simultaneous step
it'll it'll stimulate the antibodies
only on the lower side of your body
so if you did if you made the mistake i
did which was leaning while you did it
try try this
lean the other way
there we go there we go
antibodies stimulated
and evenly distributed now we're in good
shape
all right uh question for all of you i
was just chatting with the local
subscribers before i fired up youtube
and asked i'm going to ask you the same
question on youtube
is body language real
in other words is it a skill which you
can learn
and apply
or maybe you've already learned it
and and then you apply it
is body language real go
yes yes yes
yes yes absolutely yes yes yes
yes yes yes okay looks like we have
universal agreement that body language
is real question number two
how do you know you're good at reading
it
yeah you're not so certain now are you
here's my observation
it doesn't matter if body language is
real or not
for most purposes
it doesn't matter
because you don't know if you're good at
reading it
that's the problem
the problem is not whether
body language is real
the problem is you think you can read it
and you can't
you're terrible at it
uh it's the same problem with pattern
recognition right our brains are pattern
recognition machines
and
we see patterns and we think they mean
something even when they don't that's
why we have science to
to essentially get around our own
illusions about patterns
well
don't you think that your pattern
recognition
is what's driving your interpretation of
body language
all right so now you all think that body
language is is a real thing
and you got real quiet here's my next
question
you ready to have your brain blown off
you ready you ready
how many of you
listening or watching right now
have been accused of feeling something
you did not feel
because somebody you know
misread your body language how many this
week
this week
i'll read your uh messages
all the time most of the time me me me
yep often yup yup yup yes true true true
yes true
every now read
here
every day
a few knows
every day every day yes yes yes every
day
all right now now
you see where i'm going here
if body language reading were a real
thing
don't you think they'd read your your
body language right
don't you think that the people who
accuse you of being let's say angry when
you weren't angry or
not interested when you were interested
whatever it was they were they were
blaming uf
don't you think that the person who did
that thought that they were good at
reading body language
wouldn't you say
probably every person who falsely
accused you because they read your body
language wrong i'll bet every one of
them
thought they did it well
right
it's sort of like do your own research
how many of you think that it's uh
wise and notable to do your own research
there's a big story most of you seen it
about quarterback aaron rodgers
who is getting a lot of attention
because he
was fairly eloquent in describing his
process of
deciding whether to get vaccinated or
not he decided apparently not to
he he thought there were some risks of
allergic reactions in his case that
might be unique to him
i don't know if that's a thing
do you
is that a thing
did
i don't know i mean i looked it up but i
couldn't find that it's a thing but he
thinks it's a thing
now
if i asked you should you do your own
research and talk to your doctor
to decide what to do most of you would
say what
should you do your own research on let's
say anything but vaccinations
and then talk to your doctor
that's the way you should handle it
right do your own research and talk to
your doctor how many of you think you
should only do one of those
only your own research
or only talk to your own doctor
nobody right
you would all agree
100 that you should do your own research
and then talk to your doctor
you know doctors are saying different
things right
they're not all they're all saying the
same thing
so how do you know you got the right
doctor
you're basically imagining that you were
good at picking a doctor
you probably didn't pick your doctor
most of you just sort of took the doctor
that was there because you don't know
how to pick a good doctor from a bad
doctor
so and
similar to uh getting a financial
advisor
there are more financial advisors than
there are stocks
how do you know you got a good financial
advisor they don't they don't beat the
market
more than a monkey with a dartboard
they usually do worse than a monkey with
a dartboard
let's say compared to index funds
so here's the problem that we run into
all the time
body language is totally real
but you can't do it
you just think you can
financial analysis in which you look at
the pros and cons of companies and study
their balance sheets and look at their
business model and study the management
quality
that's very real
you can't do it
but you think you can you think he can
likewise doing your own research to
decide what you should do about
vaccinations
you think you can do that
but you can't
you can't likewise almost everything
that you see on twitter that's a graph
or a chart or is proving something
you think you can read that and come to
a decision that's pretty good
but you can't
you don't have those skills
nobody does
basically nobody does
you know i
the reason that i continually promote
people like andres backhouse and
anatoly lebarsky is that they seem to be
very close to having those skills but of
course nobody's right all the time
right
so when you don't know how bad you are
of something
until you see somebody who's good at it
would you agree with that
would you agree that generally speaking
it's impossible to know how bad you are
or something until you meet somebody
who's good at it
take singing for example
i suppose you had never met a good
singer
you probably thought you could do it
and then you meet mariah carey and you
say oh okay i don't know what i was
doing but that wasn't singing
that singing
whatever i was doing i don't even know
what that was anymore
right so the problem is you'll never
meet somebody who's good at body
language because there aren't many of
them i don't know if there are any of
them really but i'm assuming that the
people who study it
you know professionally probably are
pretty good at it
pretty good but you're never going to
meet them
right and it's not you
so you should all i would encourage you
to do is have some humility
about the assumption that you can do
your own research now let me
give you my macro opinion of aaron
rodgers bunch of people
sent me his video and said hey this is
really persuasive
this guy gets it
and
here's where he lost me
he lost me when he called himself a
critical thinker
so far so good right called himself a
critical thinker and then he
demonstrated it by saying that he did
his own research
that's where he lost me
because if you're a critical thinker you
know you can't
if he were a critical thinker he would
know that he can't do his own research
not in any reliable way
i mean even if he were a top researcher
he probably couldn't
let me give you another example
the director of the cdc i guess recently
claimed that
face masks are 80 percent effective
really
really is there anybody who believes
that face masks are 80
effective 80 percent
even the people who are in favor of them
are are giving numbers that are like sub
20 and we're not even entirely sure
about that
right
so uh of course
uh this caused somebody in the comments
to that there was a tweet about it
and as soon as i saw it i thought that
must be a typo
didn't you think that
if you saw that the the head the
director of the cdc
the director
if you if you read something that said
she thought mass were 80 effective
wouldn't you think that was a typo
or just
didn't really happen
but apparently it did
it did and apparently and i didn't know
this there are a whole bunch of studies
that show that maths are
70 to 80 percent effective in certain
situations that are basically not this
one
how long did it take
for somebody to reply to the tweet
that showed a whole bunch of studies
that show masks totally work
how long did it take somebody to paste a
whole bunch of studies
the show masks
totally don't work
about a second
so right next to each other on twitter
is a link to an article that mentions a
whole bunch of studies masks totally
work and then another one a whole bunch
of studies masks totally don't work
so when aaron rodgers goes to do his own
research
how does he sort that out
now he was talking about vaccinations
not masks but it's a perfect example
do you think aaron rodgers with whatever
skill stack he brings to this
could be a critical thinker
and then sort out whether mass work or
not
with two completely different sets of
answers
i can't
could you
how many of you could do that
right so he did his own research but
it's absurd
because he never knows what he doesn't
know
right
if you're outside of a if you're from
the outside of the area of expertise
unless you're unusually smart
you know unless you're uh you know elon
musk smart
you can't enter somebody else's field
and and like
figure it out
that's not a thing
you know it's it's a thing for the the
smartest among us but it's not a thing
generally speaking and certainly another
thing that aaron rodgers did so when he
calls himself a critical thinker i
challenge that because a critical
thinker would know that you can't do
what he claims to have done
it's not doable
with
the brains we have and the information
that's available to us it's just not
doable in any rational way
all right let's talk about this
i am so interested in the steele dossier
story update
because something's happening right
and i don't know exactly what it is
because
the some parts of the media are treating
it like it's not even a story
but it looks like it's the biggest story
and so we have these two movies running
at the same time
that is the biggest thing i've seen in
years
or it's nothing
or you know just some weasels did some
lying that's about it
so it's either some weasels did some
lying
or hillary clinton was behind or her
campaign was behind
a legitimate plan to overthrow the
basically to cheat in the major election
and or overthrow
a sitting president once trump was
elected
it's either what is it is it the worst
thing in the world or is it nothing
do your own research
go go look at the media do you think you
can figure it out
if it's nothing or it's a whole bunch
well
i think this story is telling you
how deeply the
intelligence
assets in this country are embedded in
the media
that's all this is telling us right
you know as glenn greenwald often tweets
and writes
that the public isn't fully aware
that major parts of our media are just
controlled by
the cia or cia assets or
some damn intelligence
you know units of the government
and
this isn't
this isn't conspiracy theory stuff
this is really well documented stuff
i don't know if anybody even
i don't think there's anybody serious
who even doubts it right
that our intelligence agencies directly
influence the news
and
so when you see that this story is sort
of semi-disappeared
there it's definitely covered
and the opinion people are talking about
it but it should be the main story
i think
and yet
sort of downplayed everywhere
now
actually that's an exaggeration the
washington post covered it
so give them that jonathan jonathan swan
i think he's axios
uh tweeted that the tweet of the
washington post coverage so i looked on
axios to see the coverage and there
wasn't anything today
but i'm sure they covered it originally
and so jonathan swann
summarizes the washington post coverage
of it this way
he says the charges are not only
did clinton slash democrats fund the
dossier but a long time clinton dem
operative was one of the sources for the
rumors about trump
and then he summarizes that by saying
doesn't get much worse
right
right as in this the biggest story
it doesn't get much worse
but it's not the biggest story
do you see now
that the uh
do you see now
that
um
there's somebody deciding what a story
is
you get that right
there's somebody
and it probably varies depending on what
the story is
but somebody controls
whether or not the world thinks it
matters
and amazingly whoever that is or those
people or entities or
a series of forces whatever it is has
decided that this won't get attention
it's really freaky isn't it when you see
it in real time
when you see that the news is just not
even close to real it's just
it's just a brainwashing operation you
can't see who's pulling the strings all
the time but sometimes you can see the
strings
this is one of those times when you can
see the strings you're like hey hey hey
i can actually see those strings
and it won't matter
what are you going to do about it
so let's say you and i see this the
how bad this story is what are you going
to do about it
no that's right what am i going to do
about it i can't think of anything i can
do about it
wait i don't know
so it's a weird story it's the biggest
story ever
treat it like it's nothing
to be even more amazed
turns out that rachel maddow is running
a report
that durham you know the very same
person who's coming out with this new
information
and barr ex ag bar intentionally ignored
emails that quote prove
trump was in direct communications with
the russian alpha bank
a covert community communication channel
existed
during the 2016 campaign that bar and
durham knew was real but they covered up
boomerang
says
rachel maddow gotcha
so
are any of the other major media
covering that story
where's that story on cnn
i didn't see it
where's that story on fox news
i don't know i didn't see it
did she just make this up
this is just totally made up
and
don't you think there's a little context
missing
so she claims that there are emails that
durham and barr saw but ignored
what what is the missing context
they saw it
and they ignored it
the missing context is why did they
ignore it
probably because it was bs or
unimportant or
some trivial email
probably
there's nothing here and rachel maddow
has decided to
turn it into something
who controls msnbc
depends who you ask
some would say intelligence agencies
i can't confirm that but that's a that's
a common claim
if you're an intelligence agency
wouldn't you want to create the counter
narrative that oh no it really was trump
who is colluding with russia after all
this is so heavy-handed
this is like really obvious heavy-handed
manipulation of the public it's kind of
crazy and here's the thing it's totally
working
no matter how easily you can see the the
puppet strings and say hey hey this is
clearly manipulation and a trick
it still works
because again what the hell are you
going to do about it
take your story to the media
hey i see what's going on here i think
i'll
i'll call my contacts at cnn and report
it
seriously what the hell are you going to
do about it as long as the media is
going to cover it the way they're
covering it that's
sort of the end of it
there's nothing you can do
what are you going to do call tim poole
if he if he doesn't uh if he recovers
from his
uh covet
i mean
the independents are so small relative
to the major media that
there's nothing you can do
all
right that story just fascinates the
whole enemy that you can make something
like that disappear
so pfizer announced that they've got a
covenant pill that
at least in the test they had zero
deaths from people who took the coven
pill soon after having symptoms
and
uh
reduces deaths 89 or something like that
now
if you've got a pill and i imagine this
will get approved pretty quickly
that reduces it by 89
aren't you done
like
isn't this pill the the get back to work
bill
because
if you've got the vaccinations
themselves
and of course not everyone will take
them but they reduce the risk you know
by some enormous amount
then you've got this pill and that
reduces it by an enormous amount
you've got the monoclonal antibodies we
know that works we know the vitamin d
drip works um at least a few other
things we know work
so each of these has like takes a big
percentage out of the total risk
where the once the pfizer pill is here
and one's like it you know the um who
was it uh
uh i forget the other company that has a
pill
but i feel like we're done when we have
those
don't you
i mean i've i felt like this before so
maybe this is false optimism
but
how
how much better would it be if you've
got these pills that work so long as you
you take them early how much better
would things be if we had rapid tests
that you that are so cheap you could
just do one every day
suppose you could for one dollar test
yourself every day
and
you know not everybody would spend 365
dollars per person in their household
but a lot of people would
a lot of people would and you would get
at least the the super spreaders but if
you were catching a fast and taking the
pill fast
i feel like we're done
right i mean i don't know when we'll all
have availability of these pills
and
then the real question is do you just
buy these pills and keep them around
all right you know i'm sure they're
prescription
but wouldn't it be great if you could
just get some and keep them because you
don't want to have that time lag between
a dry cough and getting the prescription
because that you know that could be
eight hours right by the time you
yeah if you wake up in the middle of
night with a dry cough it could be hours
and hours so wouldn't you like to test
yourself grab a pill
you're done you've already treated
yourself go back to bed
alone in quarantine
all right
so apparently there was a claim that the
uh the uk version of the drug that got
approved
um was really just ivermectin
now oh i'm sorry there was some thought
that maybe the pfizer one or somebody
else's anyway the claim is false
and the claim was that one of these
companies was just
repurposing ivormectin
and here's a little tip for you
you can always assume that fraud is
hiding in any complicated environment
a complicated environment would be
finance
definitely fraud there
science
definitely fraud there
and we hear about it all the time it's
obvious right and
so the more confusing it is the more
likely is fraud but
when you heard the first time you heard
this rumor
that one of these big companies was just
going to try to slip ivermectin into a
different name of a pill
that
you should have known that wasn't a
thing
because it would be too easy to catch
them
right
how hard would it be for somebody to
just you know somebody who knows how to
do it to take a look at it and say uh
this is just ivermectin
you guys have been screwing us it would
be so easy
to find it out it would be ridiculous
for them to try that
uh zunar says wrong what are you going
to do well what you're going to do is
start taking ivermectin
that's what you're going to do if
and again the rumor is false so so
there's no uh
persuasive evidence that ivory mechton
works as far as i know
but
i also wouldn't know
um
all right good comment though sooner
so i would just say that the only reason
anybody would believe this ivermectin
rumor that is really the
the drug that's in these other pills
rebranded is because we'll believe
anything now
like nothing seems off the table does it
when you hear this story about the
steele dossier the the real way it was
created
doesn't it almost feel to you
as if there's just nothing that's off
the table anymore just anything's
possible
am i right
so you can make up any rumor and
somebody's going to believe it because
people say well
that's not any worse than the five
things i heard on the news that might be
true
yeah we've lost all trust that that is
true
um
how would you like me to fix
the supply chain problem
you ready
now remember i'm never totally serious
when i say stuff like that
but i think it's fun to talk about it
i'll give you a little background
i
tweeted and talked to you the other day
and i said
that one of the secrets of persuasion is
that whoever makes the best visual graph
of whatever the problem or solution is
whoever does the best job of the
visualization part ends up being in
charge
because the visualization
tells people what to do for the first
time
because if it's a complicated situation
people can't read through it and decide
what they want to do but if you give
them a nice clean
chart or pie chart or visualization
and it's accurate
people suddenly will line up behind it
say oh okay now we know what to do we
know what the problem is etcetera
so
the the power of being good at creating
visualizations is way underrated
because i used to do that you know for
my corporate jobs
and i discovered that
basically i was running the department
because i could make the visualization
compelling or not for whatever i wanted
and it felt like the chart making person
was running stuff it certainly felt like
that when i was making the charts
because because i could make them good
or bad if i wanted
so
hearing my explanation of the power of
charts ryan peterson ceo of flexport who
you already know because he did a
terrific thread in which he went to
actually visited the ports he's a you
know he works in this industry so he
knows what questions they ask and
where to look for problems
and he came up with a pretty good
analysis a very good analysis actually
so good that the governor of california
called him to see what was going on see
if he could help
so it was that good
and uh and then he followed up with
building a presentation that's really
good
really good so you can see it on my
twitter feed or just
look for ryan peterson the send part on
the end is sen petersen
ceo of flexport and you can see his
stuff there and i recommend it
because i think it's really fun actually
weirdly
because i'm a total nerd about business
models
does anybody else have that
yeah i went to business school and so i
just got hooked on business models
like what what is it that makes some
company have a process that makes money
and it's different some others
yeah i see some other people saying the
same thing
that
business models are just endlessly
fascinating to me
so anyway seeing seeing this flowchart
of what the problem is and i'll let me
quickly summarize the problem
you think the problem was truck drivers
right
how many of you have been told
the problem is not enough truck drivers
well that is a problem-ish
but it's not the immediate problem it's
not the reason stuff is backed up
because there are drivers sitting in
trucks
with an empty
container on the back
and they don't have any place to put the
empty
so you have you have drivers all over
the place with just an empty on the back
and no place to put it
so they can't pick up a new one so they
can't do any work because they can't get
rid of the one that's on the back now
why can't they get rid of the one in the
back well the ports
got slammed with the the pandemic
traffic because people bought more goods
than they consumed services so people's
spending patterns radically changed
and they started buying stuff because
they were stuck at home instead of going
on a vacation
and buying gas and stuff
so
that momentary shock of the system
caused a build up that rippled and the
ripple was
that they didn't have a place to put the
empty containers and then that slows
everything down because they're in the
way
now part of the solution was uh getting
approval to stack some of the containers
in places that they couldn't stack them
or in ways that they couldn't stack them
before
and i think that
ryan peterson was instrumental in
getting that happening quickly so it
made a little bit of a difference
it's not the solution
but the big problem
is
that there are you need a special kind
of chassis in other words the the part
that's behind the the big rig truck it
has to be a special kind for a empty ca
or any kind of container to be uh
carried on
and there aren't enough of those
to carry the new traffic because they're
all used up with an empty on it they
can't go anywhere now you say to
yourself scott this is the easiest
problem in the world to solve
just take all those trucks with the
empties the government just say okay
temporarily here's a farmer's field it's
an emergency farmer says it's okay we'll
give them some money just drive to this
empty field and just put all your empty
containers there right
how do you get them off the truck
how do you get the container off the
truck
you need that crane
that's back at the port
you can't get them off the truck
except at the port
and do you know why you can't get them
off the truck at the port
because it's already filled with empty
containers
so the cranes the cranes and the trucks
can't get near each other even the
cranes are not being used
because there's nothing but uh trucks
with empties and empties all over the
place
and that's your problem
oh you're you're ahead of me so here's
my question
all right
suppose you took the best engineers in
the world
and you put them in the metaverse so
they could have a meeting in
in the
zuckerberg's
virtual world so it feels like they're
there and you take you know your elon
musk's i like to use them for every
example he just fits every example it
seems like you take your elon musk you
take your you know best
engineers from a few different places
and you just put them in one place
you say here's the problem
the normal way that
empties are taken off is with the same
crane i think fact-check me on this the
same crane that they use at the ports to
do everything else that the cranes do
so the cranes as they're built
are sort of
multi-purpose
for the ports
but suppose
you wanted to
very quickly develop a an engineering
solution that would simply
take an empty off
the first thing the first advantage is
that you're only dealing with empties
so if you were to build a crane or
or a forklift type device whatever it
would take
you wouldn't have to make it very strong
compared to the ones at the port
because the port has to take full
containers
as well as empties so that has to be way
way way stronger
but if you're only dealing with the
empties and it's an emergency you just
want to get empties off chassis
could you
modify a forklift
could you
build one of those magnet things that
just picks it off as long as you've
disconnected it somehow from the chassis
could you do it with a giant magnet
how long would it take a caterpillar for
example to modify anything that they
have existing
they can very quickly just grab empties
and and
toss them off
right
so suppose you did a you know it's an
overused concept but basically a
manhattan project to find a temporary
engineering solution for removing
empties from chassis
not at the port
so
you know is there such a thing
is there anybody who knows is there such
a thing as that like just a
badass forklift that's big enough to
take an entire empty container off a
truck is there such a thing
and could you modify
some other piece of equipment or
equipments
that could do that
oh there it is there's somebody gave me
the
actual picture of a forklift that's
meant for exactly that
so how hard would it be to get a few
forklifts in some big farmer fields
so i'm saying yes they already exist
so i so you don't really need to move
the crane
anywhere do you maybe just these
forklifts
yeah
so i guess there's there's more
questions right
remember i told you uh every time you
think you can do your own research
you just find out that that's not
something you can do
so here's a perfect example so here i am
trying to do my own research
but you know it's not my full-time job
just like it isn't most people's
full-time job to research anything
and
i don't know what's going on
still because
if there exists and i can see that they
do exist
these giant forklifts
probably they're all being used at the
ports themselves
but it seems like maybe for a day or two
you could at least get a few of them and
just
outsource them to the farmer's field or
wherever
uh yeah redesigned the trucks to be
self-emptying so i just tweeted there is
such a device so there are trucks that
are self-unloading
so it looks like they've got some kind
of a roller thing so they just dip it
down and let the then they drive away
slowly and that
and the container just
but i don't think they make those for
too many chassis
um
forklifts can't run on soft ground good
point
good point so you need some kind of
paved situation
that's a really good point
but they could if it's packed down they
could if it's packed down dirt they
could probably
maybe not
too heavy
all right
um
you did you hear about travis scott he
has this festival called the astro world
in houston
and apparently the crowd uh
surged it's not clear why and eight
people died and hundreds were injured
and stuff
and
is it my imagination or is the fourth
leading cause of death in this country
being killed by celebrities
so you got your alec baldwin
slaying one person this week you got
your nfl players killing people with
their automobiles
you got travis scott gives a concert
and kills eight people
then you've got all your celebrities who
are so thin
that is causing a generation of kids to
have body image
problems and die of eating disorders and
suicide
and
here's a question i ask you
so there are
several examples of celebrities have
killed people
just this week
there are three examples of celebrities
killing people
within the week
or two weeks i guess
now
think about your profession
so those of you who are working
think about your job how many people in
your job killed anybody in the last two
weeks
let's say you're an accountant
let's say you scoop ice cream at the
baskin-robbins how many ice cream
scoopers killed anybody in the last two
weeks
very low number
very low number
but how many how many celebrities killed
people
a lot
a lot right
and it's funny it's no it's not funny
it's tragic of course but it's gotten to
the point where
it might be the fourth leading cause for
anybody over under 30.
you know just stay away from any
celebrity related thing now i'm not even
just think about how much you could pump
up the number killed by celebrities
think of all the things that celebrities
have
promoted in public that you should do or
not do that probably killed people
probably
probably a few right
uh
depending on your political leanings if
you
if you're of the camp that says abortion
is murder then you've got the
celebrities you know supporting abortion
so depending on your point of view you'd
say well let's chalk up some more to the
celebrities i know celebrities seem very
very dangerous is what i'm saying
that's what i'm saying
all right
pretty sure that's all i wanted to talk
about today
oh no
i would like to remind you
at the beginning of the pandemic
one of my predictions was
that you can't tell how any country you
would do
in the first few innings
anybody remember me saying that just so
we can verify that i said that right
from the beginning
i said you won't be able to tell what
countries are making the right decisions
and that leadership won't even be a
variable you can isolate
everybody thought that that you could do
that i think i'm the only person who
said from the start
you'll never be able to do it
so what's the news today well it's the
opposite of what it used to be and yet
leadership hasn't changed
so there's probably not that much
difference in leadership in europe
versus the united states but suddenly
europe's having problems that we're not
having
so europe's now the epicenter of the
pandemic as of today
germany reported his highest number of
new coronavirus infections in one day
since the pandemic began
um and new new cases across europe have
risen 56 and everything now i'm not
going to tell you that the united states
did better than europe
what i will tell you is we don't know
what why anything is working
we still don't
like you know even the most basic thing
which is well the most vaccinated
country should be in the best shape
that doesn't even seem to hold
at this point but the one thing i'm
pretty sure is true is that there wasn't
enough of difference in leadership
changing in the united states really in
terms of the pandemic even biden isn't
that much different than trump would
have been
i don't think europe changed that much
leadership wise so leadership just
doesn't predict
is there anybody who's willing to agree
with me at this point
that leadership
did not predict
outcomes anybody is anybody willing to
agree with me that leadership did not
predict outcomes
oh i got some agreement okay
nope
all right so we got we have some
agreement there that's all i can ask for
all right here's a you here's a little
uh thing from
twitter you know twitter does this cool
thing where if there's a big story and
lots of tweeting on it they'll have
they'll put their own editorial
summary of
what's going on with all the tweeting on
that topic
and i always like that because it's a
real good fast way to learn what's going
on so i like the feature a lot
but here's one way that they describe
something and let and you tell me
if this is biased or not right i'll just
read the summary it's a bullet point
one of three bullets under what you need
to know that i assume twitter editorial
wrote and i quote public health
officials
warn against taking ivermectin a drug
often prescribed for animals that can be
dangerous for people to treat kophan 19.
now
does that sound
a little bit biased
do you think there was a better way to
phrase this so you didn't suggest that
people taking it were taking a horse
medicine which of course is horseshit
this is
this is like
just mind-boggling
that somebody could write this sentence
here here would be an honest
uh version of this
uh public health officials warn against
taking ivermectin
uh especially the the animal version of
it
because it hasn't shown to be uh
effective according according to them
this is not me talking
um and the animal version especially
could be dangerous to humans
now it takes a little bit longer
but it's but at least it's clear
right
i would like to know that there's an
animal in a human version and i would
like to know that if you took the animal
version you might have some problems but
if you took the human version not so
much
and that's the story right
shacky is still saying ivor meccans save
lives all over africa i don't think so
i don't think so
uh
you and i know you've seen the
information that suggests that
that's i don't think that's going to
stand up i would make a very large bet
that ivermecton is not saving africa
i mean i don't know what's going on
there
but
and
i like i'd like to say also whenever i
make a statement like that
i can never be 100 sure
can you accept
that even when i talk with confidence
you can't really be 100 sure of anything
we don't live in a world where anybody
can do that not me not you not anybody
so when i say things that sound like
absolutes just in your mind
translate that into not quite an
absolute
all right
um
and now
i believe i've done my tiny bit of duty
to help the supply chain
because i feel like the supply chain
problem is one of those things where
there are enough
brains and resources in existence
but hasn't quite
hasn't quite uh you know been focused in
the right places at the right time by
the right people and ryan peterson i
would say is the most productive person
on this
and if i could give him a boost to you
know boost his signal
then i think that collectively we've
done something good
because you know it goes without saying
but i'll say it anyway
you know people always say after they
say it goes down saying they always say
it anyway
that my uh my ability to boost um ryan
peterson's signal which i think has been
productive
and it may have been part of what got
the governor to call him we don't know
for sure
but
you can only do that because
there are a lot of people paying
attention
so that is all your power
um if if i helped you focus it
in a productive way that would be great
uh yeah infrastructure bill got passed
so boring um
so that's the part that a lot of people
agreed on just the pure infrastructure
the real infrastructure part
uh and
how would you know if that's a good idea
how would any of you
know if the infrastructure bill and by
the way they they've separated out the
social programs and now that's that's
going to be part of the build back
better separate bill
but the one that really was
infrastructure which i get would have
taken three years to get an
infrastructure bill
so you can't be too happy about that but
how would you know it's not all just
pork and
how do you know it's in that thing
i don't
i don't know
i mean i like the idea of
infrastructure
now here's another question
we started this infrastructure bill
thing in 2018 when the economy was a
very different economy
it was pre-pandemic you know pre-massive
run-up of the debt
uh at least as much as it did run up
and here's my question and i don't know
the answer to it so it's not
it's not
a fake question it's a real question
should we be stimulating the economy
right now
is there anybody here who is good enough
in economic i mean i have a degree in
economics and i don't know the answer to
this question
is this the right time to be stimulating
the economy
because it feels like the wrong time
doesn't
because you know our our jobs are coming
back strongly
we're ordering more things than our our
capacity to deliver
and inflation is high
now i don't know what the supply chain
is going to do to inflation should
should drive it up blah blah blah
but
is anybody reporting
that the infrastructure bill might be a
huge disaster because only because of
its timing not because it's a good or
bad idea
in and of itself is anybody writing that
is that a story even or are all the
smart people saying i don't worry about
that
because you need i mean we need the
infrastructure right so it might be that
we don't have a choice
you just gotta you have to have good
roads you need
more broadband you just need this stuff
um
yeah i don't know how much of it is junk
and pork and stuff like that
get rid of the vaccine mandates well
i would say that
the
if these pfizer and the other pill
if they get approved and they really
stop it in its tracks and you can really
do
rapid testing
i feel like
we've got to open up at that point
you know i've told you before
somebody says i work for the cia
all right
did they assign you to watch me today
uh
you know
a while back i learned
how intelligence agencies
approach citizens and try to try to
influence them
and
once you know how they do it you can
spot it pretty easily
and i've got one now
that's that's trying to uh approach me
um
and i would say they they act very
different from normal people
i'm not going to tell you what they do i
don't want to tell you that but but it's
easy to spot
i can't tell you
all right
um
russia collusion was an insurrection i
think so and that would also explain oh
here's some more
over on locals people are posting all
kinds of pictures of
uh large devices that move containers
and so there are portable ones they
don't have to be cranes
all right
um
uh national guard has some national
guard have some container movers yeah i
imagine they would
all right
that is all i have to talk about today
uh if my energy was low
that's because that three hours of sleep
but
i hope we made the world a better place
and i hope
you're all a little bit more cautious
about imagining what you can do with
your own research
yes i know i am
if there's one place that you can uh
guarantee i will be humble
because i know some of you have a
problem with me being right too much
but where i guarantee you i'll always be
humble is that i can't do my own
research on any of this
i mean i can i can talk myself into
thinking i did it but i can't
so
i mean if you're substantially smarter
than me
in this particular way maybe you can
but uh i know i can't
so
unless you're pretty sure you're way
smarter than
than i am about how to analyze stuff
i don't think you can either not with
confidence anyway not with any
confidence
um
what kept me awake i
i hate sleep
so when i woke up i just didn't want to
be asleep again and then it doesn't
happen
i feel like sleep is just wasted
wasted life
but i will tell you i've been thinking
more and more about the the state of
what a dream is
have you ever have you ever said to
yourself the one way that you know this
is not a simulation
is that the stuff is solid
do you ever think to think that to
yourself
well i know
that whatever this is that i'm
experiencing my reality i know it can't
be
just code or pro program because they're
solids
right it doesn't go through it
you know if i were made of software
or some imaginary thing
none of this could happen right it
wouldn't be solid
but what about dreams
in your dreams everything's solid isn't
it
in your dreams things have weight
don't they
in your dreams there's still gravity
so apparently
we absolutely routinely pretty much most
of us every night
have an illusion in which there is full
weight
and gravity and all the rules of physics
sometimes you can fly in your dreams
sometimes
but
the question of whether you can imagine
solids when there are no solids it has
been answered
yeah you can it's called a dream that's
just one way you can do it
all right
which is different than virtual reality
because when you've got a virtual
reality goggles on you can't actually
feel any of the objects so that's that's
less than a dream a dream a dream you
have the sensation that objects have
weight
dreams are software updates
could be or defragmenting
it feels like defragging to me
so scott doesn't have spirituality i
guess it's all just a waste
is it
i have no physical sensation in youtube
well but the rules of physics apply in
your dreams
is what i'm saying
um
i learned your lesson about doing your
own research trying to figure out how to
do a live broadcast yeah
that that's that's a pretty humbling
thing
now some of you are going to say but
scott what about that
uh situation you gave us with the
spasmodic dysphonia and
googling your own
voice problem
that's an exception
and
one of the things that makes an
exception is that once i found it i
could verify it
so having having found it on my own
that i could easily take it to an expert
i could find an expert once i had a name
for it and then the expert could say oh
yeah you're right and then
you know my research just ends up being
the same as science you know i end up in
the same place so that's really a
special case
and i do think that that you that a
motivated person can do a slice
but i don't think we can evaluate
studies very well most of us
all right
that is all i have for today i believe
i'm babbling and i'm going to say
goodbye to you youtube
talk to you later
