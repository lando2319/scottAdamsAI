well it's time time for coffee with
scott adams and i don't think it gets
much better than this all day long so
better enjoy it grab that pleasure while
you can grab it by the neck
and let's enjoy it and to enjoy it to
his maximum potential all you need is a
cup or a margarita glass i'll take your
chelsea steiner canteen jugger flash a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
is called
yup that's right the simultaneous set
but it happens now go
ah
i feel my need for a third booster shot
just decreased to five percent
we'll stay that way apparently but uh
good for now we're good for now
let us begin
our episode by talking about
anecdotal persuasion
um as you know if you watch cnn at all
what is it that they want us to
understand
well one thing more than anything else
orange man bad we'll get to that later
but there's a second thing they want us
to believe
which is that they are the the the
network of science
who
support the party of science the
democrats
they're all about the science
the science
and they would like to give you data
good solid data
within the context of science
and that will help you all make really
good decisions
except that the way they're persuading
you
is with anecdotes
what
that's right
even cnn knows that they can't convince
anybody with science
because science is really important
except it doesn't work
for persuasion
now in a sense it does because the most
the most persuasive thing you could do
is to stop using data
which
cnn has done
so instead of telling you that uh
that uh vaccinations are good
or that you should get them
they'll give you anecdotes of people
having a bad time
and instead of telling you here's the
data that says climate change is to get
ya
they say
here's somebody who died in a flood
so cnn is in this weird situation
where they're the promoters of science
while couching all of their stories and
anecdotes
literally the opposite
of scientific thinking
so
that seems ironic except that
it is actually quite compatible with
science
to not tell people the science
if you want to persuade people
don't tell them the science apparently
that doesn't work you got to scare them
scare them with stories so here's one
for today
melissa joan hart
you know her from tv as uh
sabrina the teenage witch
she was fully vaccinated and still got
sick with covid
did not get hospitalized but she's
having a tough time with it
now she might be on the list of people
you'd say
needs that third booster
so cnn
is uh persuading us with anecdotes and
is working
because scientifically speaking we don't
get much persuaded by facts but
anecdotes
yes
would you like to hear a true story
from behind the curtain
things that only
minor celebrities
like me and sabrina is a teenage witch
experience true story i once
partnered with joan hart
who was sabrina the teenage witch
on a local episode of wheel of
fortune so sometime back it was a while
ago as you might imagine
uh the the wheel of fortune show did a
traveling version where they would do
the regular you know national show but
they would also go to different regions
and do a local show
and it would be local minor celebrities
so i was one of the local miners
celebrities who appeared on a california
version of the show and it was still you
know it was vanna white and
it was the regular staff they just did a
local room and i was partnered with uh
because it was celebrities they put us
on teams because we were too stupid to
too dumb to do it ourselves i guess
so melissa joan hart was on my team
and we did not do well
turns out
turns out we did not do well at all
and i that's where i learned that a
20-something
person is not the best person to have a
wide range of the trivia of the world
we got beaten by a
retired ex basketball professional
nba player
and i thought to myself if you get
beaten in a battle of uh intelligence
because part of it is intelligence
uh buy a retired
basketball player
you need to raise your game a little bit
so so uh
sabrina the teenage witch and i got
smoked
at wheel of fortune
one of my biggest failures
to this day i i
i bow in shame
so
here's some more uh
fake news
maybe
maybe
so here's a story i would have to see
this with my own eyes to believe it's
true
because you know how the one way to
identify fake news i've told you many
times
it's a little bit too on the nose
you know when the news is a little bit
too perfect
it's usually not true
it's one of the most
predictive
tells
you know something that will really tell
you that something's
not working out is uh
that's not really melissa joan hart is
it
somebody's sending me a picture of
melissa joan hart that i don't think is
hard is it
anyway
so here's the news i don't believe that
the daily mail is quoting notes
retrieved after the 2010 operation for
uh to get osama bin laden
and it says that osama had a handwritten
note
that said he wanted biden to be
president of the u.s
and banned any attempt to assassinate
him because they wanted an incompetent
president who will lead the u.s into
crisis
now
does that sound real
what do you think
i have to see the note
i'd have to have like a handwriting
analyst
look into it
yeah i'm seeing some people say it's
true some people say it's fake
i don't know
i would say it might be true it might be
fake but
but
it is in the category of things that are
usually fake
if i had to bet money on it i'd bet fake
but maybe 40 chance is true you know
something like that i mean it wouldn't
be a good bet it wouldn't be a safe bet
but i bet it's not true
or that it's out of context or something
somebody said they heard that years ago
it doesn't make it true
all right
well
all right here's a
another anecdotal persuasion from cnn
why is it that climate change only makes
storms and hurricanes worse
why does climate
change
make everything worse everywhere
are you telling me that you can't come
up with one story
about the place that used to be not as
good for agriculture but they're having
record agriculture
no
no there's no story like that
because it's not so much climate
worsening
although there's a lot of worsening
going on it appears
but there's climate change
wouldn't you expect
just your common sense that there might
be some places in the globe that were a
little too cool
and making them a little warmer really
help things
where are those stories
and are you seeing the real story if
you're only seeing the bad stuff
if the change is making some stuff worse
and some stuff better
let me ask you this
could you
have thrown a dot dart
at any point in the timeline in american
let's say industrial age history
and
could you
not have found
that there were more disasters in some
places than usual
at the same time that some parts of the
world were having a better than usual
time
i feel as though you could have done
these same anecdotal stories at any time
in the past no matter what climate
change you have been doing
you tell me you can't find even if you
took away all climate change
right if let's take the assumption it
makes no difference at all
you don't think you could find lots of
people lots of places on earth
setting records
of course
of course you could but you would also
find places that are having the best
weather they've ever had
i don't know that this should be
persuading you it's not science
but uh that's that's your climate change
persuasion all anecdote
uh cbs news has decided that everything
is about climate change
including the taliban takeover
and that one of the reasons that the
taliban so easily
uh got control of the country is that
the rural places
their crops had been destroyed by
climate change
and then they were
they're more easily co-opted into a new
system because they were desperate
so
don't you think
that the news is going to figure out how
to make climate change about everything
like every story is going to have to
have a climate change angle how it made
it worse
and the further they go with this the
less credible they are
it seems to me
if if they stuck with the things that
really seem pretty solid
i think it would be a better argument
than trying to make everything that
happens about climate change
but on the other hand they're not making
a logical argument they're making an
emotional one
and for that this stuff probably works
as i saw in the comments and i was going
to say it myself why is it
that climate change made everything
worse except the poppy fields
am i wrong
were the
were the poppy fields
the only thing
that wasn't affected by climate change
i it turns out climate change might be
really really good for poppies
um
and that's related to another topic
which is the question where does the
taliban get their funding
where do you think the taliban gets
their funding
well almost entirely from illegal
activities they're basically uh
you know the taliban is basically an
islamic mafia
and they sell drugs
and traffic various things
and uh
they make anywhere from hundreds of
millions to you know a low billion
per year from doing illegal stuff uh
kidnappings ransom mineral exploitation
uh illegal tax collection well i don't
know what's illegal
um and that sort of thing
now
let's say
that selling illegal drugs
poppies
is their main source of income
what would be a way
to destroy their poppy business
and weaken them
fentanyl
now
as you know i'm not pro-fentanyl
fentanyl is what probably killed my
stepson
but
it's kind of weird that afghanistan is
cozying up to china the main producer of
fentanyl
because i feel like you could produce
fentanyl cheaper
and ship it easier
i feel as if
the poppy business might be in trouble
am i wrong
because fentanyl apparently is cheaper
easier
you can ship it better you don't have to
process it as much you know if you've
got a lab you're you're set
you don't need any property
shouldn't be that hard to get the
chemicals because you can get them from
china as much as you want
right
so
i wonder if the poppy business is going
to take a hit
secondly
you know i heard lots of reports that we
were intentionally allowing the poppy
fields to stay
because it's the only way the poor
people in afghanistan could survive they
had to sell
illegal drugs
or i'll say a starf death
well
is that our problem still
i would say that when we were in
afghanistan
and had you know a degree of control
over the government
directly or indirectly it really was our
problem to feed everybody
and maybe we have to make some tough
choices
about feeding the locals versus you know
killing their their poppy business
but we're gone now
can't we bomb it now
now now that we're out of the business
can't we just destroy all the poppy
fields
and if we did
what would happen
it would just make fentanyl more
available right
you know the fentanyl would just fill
the the gap
so i'm not entirely sure you could mow
the poppy fields and make any difference
at all
because it's just such a fungible thing
that somebody would say oh fewer poppies
let's just crank up the fentanyl
production we'll break even
so i don't even know if you can do
anything about it
um
but i do think that fentanyl is one of
the stories that has one of these
unintended consequence sort of things
baked into it
it'll either kill the poppy business or
replace it or something or make fentanyl
bigger one of those
see
here's a
fake story
by
lack of context
right
so here's here's a challenge to you
i'm going to tell you a story that's in
the news that you all know about
afghanistan all right and then i'm going
to tell you the context that they don't
tell you that as soon as you hear it
you're going to say oh that is true
and you're going to be mad okay so my
challenge
is to make you mad
at the quality of the news coverage are
you ready
we're worried about the taliban
capturing a whole bunch of
weapons that americans left that part's
true
as far as we know i mean it looks true
so we all know that story and it's a bad
bad thing
right
it's all bad
now even if we even if the taliban can't
operate the helicopters
they could sell them somebody could
maybe reverse engineer them maybe
somebody would use them you know iran
might use them against somebody i don't
know
so
you can think of lots of bad bad things
that would happen because we left so
many weapons behind
here's what they didn't tell you are you
ready to get mad
they also have the taliban
all of the weapons of the afghan army
now how do you feel
how much difference does it make
that they got all the american weapons
we left behind
they got an army
they got the whole taliban army
they have all the weapons
that we left a 300 000 person
taliban army
the taliban army was like
five times the size of or no they the
afghan army was about five times the
size of the taliban right
so the afghan army
probably has five times
the weaponry
that we left behind
or something like
that it's basically
if you only if you own an entire
nation's army
which is what the taliban does they own
the army
do you really care about the extra
weapons that the americans left
let's put it into into context
how many how many rifles were captured
by the taliban because they were left
behind
probably a lot
like it's big alarming number right
but as a percentage of all the weapons
they gained
by taking over an army
they took over an army
they own the army
[Laughter]
i don't think a few warehouses of extra
weapons
are going to make that much difference
now wouldn't we prefer that they didn't
have those weapons of course of course
is it a mistake to leave them looks like
it
it looks like a terrible mistake
but i don't know if it's as big a deal
as we're making it i feel like the news
has intentionally taken away the context
and the context is
they conquered a whole army
they own everything that the army owned
it's all theirs now
i don't know if it made any difference i
could easily see
that there will be some things we learn
about the
decisions
that the military made about pulling out
here's my prediction
my prediction is
we're going to learn some facts that we
don't know now that will change your
mind about what happened
one of those facts we might learn is
that a lot of the advanced equipment was
disabled
maybe another fact we might learn is
that it doesn't matter how many weapons
the taliban has
because they have so many weapons from
the army it just doesn't matter and it's
possible that the
the americans said you know what if we
blow up our own weapons we're going to
injure some of our friends who are too
nearby and we're going to scare
everybody we're going to panic everybody
it's possible
that the military made a conscious
decision
to leave the weapons
meaning well obviously obviously it was
a conscious decision but i mean they
might have actually calculated
that it would be worse to destroy them
because it might have caused you know
panic and might have hurt people who
were nearby and i don't know
now of course your common sense says
seriously
you can't tell everybody to just back
off from that warehouse and just you
know lob a bomb onto it well it seems
like it i mean common sense says you
can't just throw a hand grenade in there
and
you know make sure you're you're effing
up the the sightings and stuff on the
weapons i mean how hard would it be to
lob a few grenades into the
you know into the small arms
place and blow it up i don't know seems
like you could you could
damage enough of the weapons that they
wouldn't fire
correctly
um maybe not i don't know
but
and now we're talking about maybe
dropping bombs on them after the fact
but now we can't do it
you know we can't bomb those weapons now
right because we haven't gotten the
americans out
so this is a hostage situation already
because the fact that americans are
there and the taliban can control
whether they get out that means already
they're controlling what we can and
cannot bomb right now
because we can't bomb
the weapons we left behind
too dangerous they've got her hostages
so it's already a hostage problem
so um
remember the other day i said uh or
maybe even yesterday i was saying that
we can't yet know enough to know how bad
the decision was
on the surface i'm completely with you
on the surface
it looks like the biggest botched thing
of all botched things we can all agree
on that right i will stipulate
that based on what we know so far
it looks like the worst mistake ever
made in the military industrial
or no the military political world
i guess we could agree on that
but
there's a dog not barking here
how do you explain
that a hundred percent of the people who
were not in charge knew exactly the
right thing to do
but a hundred of the percent of the
people who were in charge
didn't how do you explain that seriously
how do you explain that that's that's
not a
point it's an actual question of
curiosity
every one of us who were not there knew
what to do
but everyone who was there
didn't
and knowing what was right to do was
kind of easy wasn't it
you know
blow up your own weapons
get the get the americans out first
kind of easy
right
what do you say they were easy easy
decisions that anybody could have made
right
almost guarantees
that there's something we don't know
how many of you would agree with the
statement
that is more likely
that there's something big we don't know
about
versus it was exactly as incompetent as
it looks
which one do you think it was there's
something we don't know something big
or that it was exactly as incompetent as
it looks and the only people who didn't
know how to do it right
were the people in charge
and everybody else in the world knew how
to do it right
which is more likely
i would say that the we don't know what
happened there's more to the story
is maybe
five to one more likely
that would be my guess just based on
living in the world
you know you live in the world long
enough you start to develop these
these rules of thumb in your head
they're not accurate necessarily they're
just you know
patterns and expression and impressions
you picked up but mine is there's a five
to one chance
that the explanation is or something we
don't know about some kind of deal we
made
some kind of risk we wanted to take some
kind of leverage somebody had on
somebody some kind of threat i don't
know
something
um
so here's uh
here's another question that we all love
uh talking about is
why is it that uh
trump
well why do you think that trump might
have done a better or worse job
do you think that the democrats are
having any trump
missing trump problem
a little bit
let me tell you something that trump
would do in this situation
that biden does not okay
and i think it's easy to imagine this
now first of all trump says you wouldn't
have been in this situation and
and maybe not
because whatever it was that caused
biden to be in this situation
it probably means somebody made a
cowardly decision or
they made a hard decision and didn't
explain it to us or something i feel
like trump wouldn't have done that
i think trump would have made a hard
decision and just told us
i think you would just would have told
us yeah i mean i had to make this hard
decision it's really going to be bad for
this one thing but you know you got to
make a decision this is what i decided
but here's the other thing that i think
trump would do
that biden so far is not doing
and i think it would go like this if
trump found himself in this situation
and we don't know that he would
of having all these americans there and
having to trust the taliban to let them
out
here's what trump would probably say to
the taliban
taliban
you're getting everything you want
we only want one thing
if you don't give us that one thing
which is
allow the americans out
we'll take everything you have
everything
we will
come back every five minutes and just
mow the lawn
we will wait till you assemble in groups
larger than five and drop a bomb
in the middle of it every time as long
as it takes
forever
if you give us any trouble with getting
the hostages down and let me tell you
that i will do it for fun
i'll enjoy it
i will wipe out every freaking taliban
anybody with a gun is going to be dead i
will i will i would degrade your entire
country we'll leave nothing there
unless you let the americans out
now
we believe the taliban respond to
threats because they're rational people
and they have no benefit whatsoever of
messing with the americans except you
know whatever psychological weird evil
benefits they get
i feel as though
this is one of those situations where
trump was the perfect president
if he had been the president
now to be fair
i've said many times that it's it's not
really about having a good or bad
president
it's usually about a fit
like who's the right fit
and trump was the right fit for this
he was really the right fit for this
exactly exactly
the right president for this he just
wasn't president
i would say that trump was maybe not the
right president for the pandemic
wouldn't you say
i would say if there was one issue
really that stands above all the rest
it would be trusting trump with
health you have health decisions
right
because one of the things that trump
created for himself
is you know wild hyperbole
which works you know politically it
works really well and had a lot of
benefits
but you don't want to be the wild
hyperbole person when it's a health
scare
it's just the wrong fit it has nothing
to do with
trump's talent
it has nothing to do with you know his
brains or his motivation his intentions
or anything else just some things fit
better than other things and i'd sure
like to have a president trump while
we're trying to get americans out of
afghanistan to me that's no contest
i i feel as if even the democrats would
agree with the statement that trump
could get the americans out better
because he's scarier
let's see what else we got here
what is the difference between
biden withdrawing from afghanistan and
the california
governor's recall election
well
one difference is that the people who
will be left in afghanistan
will still have power and electricity
and their country is mostly not on fire
mostly not on fire
whereas the californians after newsome
leaves we won't have enough power or
or water
and
the sky is full of smoke because our
state is on fire
so the new some recall is a little bit
worse
in terms of what gets left behind all
right i'm kidding afghanistan's worse
but
you have to you have to ask yourself
about uh how bad is california that you
can even make a reasonable comparison to
afghanistan
and people will listen
well today i did a robots read news
comic if you're not following those i
just tweeted one out and posted it on
locals
so i only do that comic because i can
post it on locals and not get in trouble
but sometimes they're ones i release
into the wild as well
if they don't look too bad
and uh
so
the
robot read news comics you want to read
those on the afghanistan topic you don't
want to miss that
now let's talk about uh
larry elder should not be advertising
pain relief when running for governor
yeah he's on he's on one of those
pain relief commercials
so every day that goes by
that we don't hear a genuine
larry elder scandal
i think his odds of becoming governor
just go up almost every day because
california itself is looking worse every
day
um
i've i've got my
blinds down but
you want to see a picture of what it
looks like outside
uh you're going to hear the sound of my
blinds going up and it's
and i'm gonna get over lid in here but
i'll do this just so i can show you what
it looks like
oh i just realized i don't know if i can
change the
oh i don't think i can do this on
locals i'll i'll turn the screen around
all right
on youtube
let's see i think i can turn you around
i'll turn the screen around
so look at my window there and then on
locals i'll just turn the screen around
so you can see
so you're looking out my window this
looks like fog but isn't
that that's the actual air quality so
that's the smoke
and uh christina got trapped down in
town in a small aircraft she was doing a
little ferrying a an aircraft um for let
the hangar
and she can't get back in town
because she can't fly a small aircraft
in the smoke so she's she's gonna have
to get back on a commercial flight i
guess
so that's what california looks like now
tell me
if you have to put your mask on to go to
the gym
and
and you're
and you can't go outside and take a walk
i can't take a walk
but just think about that
just just try to imagine that you're in
in your state whatever state you're in
i can't take a walk
it's too dangerous
i can't go outside i mean i could walk
to my car
but i can't i literally can't go for a
walk it's just you know i've got asthma
too so it's a little worse
so how does the governor get
reelected
when the residents of the state can't
take a walk
i mean think about that
i feel as if larry elder just has to
show up
and he's going to be the next governor
you just i just don't know how you can
you can elect the guy
who manages to stay so poorly you can't
go outside
i mean that's crazy who has ever done
worse than that
ever has anybody ever done worse than
that
i don't know
uh yeah the blackouts and the brownouts
um so far the
the weather has been more mild than i
thought and i think so so here's the
weird thing
it might be that and this is true by the
way
the only reason i still have electricity
somebody tell me what's what's the only
reason i still have electricity
does anybody know why
it's because the forest fires are so bad
they're blocking the sun
so i don't need ac
i'm not making that up
that's
legitimately
true the only reason i have electricity
is because the forest fires are blocking
out the sun
and so it's cooler
i'm not making that up that's real
that's the only reason i have
electricity
do you think a governor can get
re-elected
when the only reason you have
electricity is that the forest fire
blocked the sun temporarily
how does it get worse than that
and he's responsible for you know
closing down our last
nuclear power plant the only hope we had
of having enough electricity
not good
not good we're it looks like we're going
to run out of water
in california and i don't know that
there's a plan to get more
what exactly is our
water making plan
because the only way i can see that we
could do it is stick a hose into the
ocean
build a nuclear reactor on the coast
and start desalinating
otherwise we all have to move out of
california i guess
so
um obviously i've come to the end of my
content it seems like the only the only
things happening are afghanistan and
climate change
and i guess the recall
so is
uh oh i also saw
um
was it austin and maybe millie said this
too
that that nobody saw any
predictions that the taliban could take
over in 11 days
so that's sort of the defense
so the the defense is that
we have you know 2020 hindsight
but if the military had known
that the taliban could take over
so quickly they would have acted
differently
does that does that work for you
that's even an incompetent defense
don't you expect that even if people do
a bad job
they could probably put on a pretty good
defense because you know they have time
to think about it and they get a lot of
help and
lawyers probably talk to them and say
all right say this
it won't be true but it's going to sound
pretty good it'll be good defense
they can't even defend themselves
because here's the problem
even if they had more time
shouldn't they get the get the americans
out first
the only question was what order do you
do things
and his statement about we didn't know
that the taliban would fall so quickly
doesn't address the main complaint
the main complaint is he did it in the
wrong order
and he doesn't even address it
he acts like that was the right order of
things
right
so
um i would say that i could not have
less confidence in our military
leadership that i have right now and i
would go further
i would say that if biden doesn't fire
both milli and austin
over this
then
maybe he doesn't need to be president
anymore i'm not sure if he is because
we're still trying to figure out who's
who's making the decisions
by the way does anybody know who's
making all the decisions i have a theory
on this
but
let's see your opinions so tell me in
the comments who do you think is the
power behind the power
i'm seeing susan rice blackrock hillary
clinton
uh obama
jill
susan rice hillary
she jeeping
uh valerie jarrett ron clain
okay here's the answer
um and i would i would die on this hill
meaning that i would bet basically
everything that i'm right you ready
it's a it depends who cares the most
per topic
so here's who i think is running the
country
everyone who cares the most and is also
a democrat
per topic so in other words there is
almost certainly a group of people who
really really care about let's say what
we do with israel
and i think they're in charge
because there isn't enough pushback from
anybody else so i think any group of
people
who are sort of the the experts on that
domain you know there'll be some china
experts some russia experts
some nato experts some climate change
experts et cetera i think that the
people who care the most
and
you know are most uh part of those
advisory stuff i think they're making
the decisions
because i think by the time it gets to
the advisors the advisors say i don't
know well they're the experts and i
think joe isn't
capable enough to override an expert the
way trump would
what what is the main thing you want
from a president
if i would if i were to say there's one
talent
you want the most what would it be
what talent would you most want from a
president
let's say they're all good at
communicating and the basics right so
let's say everybody by the time you
become president you've got all the
basics but what what one single talent
there you go
it's funny i watch the difference in the
comments between the people on locals
the people who subscribe to my content
and the people who may be more of a
general audience on youtube
and such a difference in the comments
and on locals people immediately went
right to the right answer which is
 detection
the only thing you need your president
to do
is to know when the experts are wrong
that's it because otherwise the experts
would just run everything
you could just say all right just tell
me what to do about climate change right
you're the experts all right i'll do
that
right the only thing the president does
is call on experts
trump
i would say
did this better than anybody's ever done
it
even with whatever mistakes you might
say and there would be a few i'd say
that trump is the best detector
we've ever had as president
i think
now that doesn't mean he also doesn't
give the most because he does
right
and you know this the old saying it
takes one to know one
well that is so true
let me give you an example
every hour and then somebody will make a
movie that involves a tennis game and
maybe a tennis professional
if you are a tennis player
and you watch a movie where people are
pretending to play tennis
you can immediately spot that they don't
know how to play tennis
right no matter how much
acting lessons they took
to you know hit correctly
anybody who's an experienced tennis
player could say
there's somebody who never hit a tennis
ball until they started practicing for
this movie
right
you same in golf right yeah right same
in golf if you're a golf expert you can
just look at somebody's swing and
you know what's going on
but trump is literally the most prolific
bullshitter
of all time
and
uh
yeah he was the most prolific
bullshitter and don't you think he can
spot it
i do
i think he's done it over and over again
now he used a little hyperbole when he
talked about
china and you know climate change being
a hoax
but if you look at the context in which
he meant that
meaning that china wanted us to be in a
bad situation economically compared to
them
it was oaks
now that doesn't mean that climate
change isn't real i'm not saying that
um
i'm saying that he correctly called out
that there was a whole bunch of
baked in with the real stuff if there's
any real stuff
right
he he spotted the part of it
and i think he got that completely right
now
the i guess the other thing
the president needs to do is take the
hard choices and take the heat
because sometimes it's not so much about
the experts it's priorities
and when it's just priorities
then you need a president who can take
any amount of heat
who could do that better than trump
nobody
ever
ever
no president could take more heat
for a decision that just needed to be
done
then pres then trump and imagine a
second term trump
oh my god
a second term trump
could make the hardest decisions because
he could and he would and i think he
would play you play the long the long
game
i think he would i think trump would
play the long game which is to make the
hard decision
withdrawing from afghanistan as one of
those and
uh just
you know just get it done and i think
history would be kind to him if he did
all right
no more old president somebody's saying
i agree with you i mean i said it before
trump ran the first time i said we
shouldn't have
70 plus year old presidents i think it's
too old
on the other hand
what is the biggest advantage of an old
president
you know what you're getting
that's the big advantage you know what
you're getting
um
and i think with trump we got exactly
what we thought we would get uh you know
the some of the details were different
but not really i mean basically you got
exactly what you you expected he he was
trump from day one he was never on trump
biden too
didn't you know what you were getting
with biden
of course you did you got exactly what
you voted for now people chose that
consciously i hope they like their
choice it doesn't look so good this week
but
the presidents need to be post-sexual
that's not a bad
that's not a bad
concept yeah if you get your presence
old enough so that they've
they've crossed over their their sex
life you have one less thing to be
distracted you know with allah clinton
for example
um
yeah once you cross 80 the the
statistics look bad i i would allow that
young 70s isn't like it used to be
so
um
i'm being asked for a lesson a micro
lesson on uh self-hypnosis for stress
relief
um
i don't know that that would be a micro
lesson so much as i should hypnotize you
so i should do a video in which i just
hypnotize you to sleep better which i
could do
i'm working on one now about how to
create assets out of nothing
you know basically psychological assets
and
coming along on that
i've got a problem right now that
there's some construction in my house
so almost as soon as i'm done with the
live streams there's going to be
construction noise all day so it's tough
to make videos and by the way if you're
on locals and you're wondering why i
slowed down on the videos that's why i
can't do them during the day like i used
to but that won't last forever so
there'll be more of them
and
that
is what i call
coffee with scott adams
that's right
you have come to the end of another
fantastic segment
the kind of entertainment that really
you can't you can't buy
because i don't sell it
you might have to watch some
advertisements but okay you could
subscribe to it so you can buy it
but forget about that
and here's how i tell you you should
watch this show
i think that different forms oh by the
way before i go i'm going to give you a
recommendation of some entertainment
media entertainment that's amazing
um
uh the way you should watch this live
stream
is either by exercising while you're
doing it you know taking a walk doing
something like that or housework you
know washing the dishes putting your
your headphones
uh or just having it on as sort of a a
friend who's talking to you while you're
getting ready for your day or commuting
that sort of thing so the way to listen
to this is not so much that you're
picking up the news
but you're having a conversation with a
friend who talks too much
thinks he knows everything
that's me i'm your invisible friend
how many of you who got lonely during
the pandemic did anybody get lonely
during the pandemic
yeah i just want to see in your comments
how many were lonely
a lot of no's because your families were
close yeah
but then there were a lot of people
especially single people it was just
devastating
but one of the ways to listen to this is
as your uh
your imaginary friend who's not really
imaginary
uh and i'm just there hanging out with
you a little bit talking about what's
new
all right here's your
recommendation have you all seen i know
you have there's a
a
a series called ted
lazzo ted laslo
ted laszlo on i think it's only apple tv
so it's a you have to buy it and i just
started watching it
and you know i've told you that there's
no such good as there's no good tv shows
anymore and there are no good movies
they don't they don't match our sense of
uh
i don't know
our
it doesn't work anymore and the content
is terrible
just terrible and it makes you feel bad
and it's cringy and all that
it's woke
and then there's the show
ted lasso now i i resisted watching it
because the
the previews are terrible
have you seen the previews
the previews
don't make that look good
but i found out there's a reason
you can't make a preview of that show
and here's why
this show is what is a cumulative
masterpiece
every moment of the show
is a little
muted a little reduced in let's say
energy
and so if you watch a like a preview
you're going to get one of these
low energy just somebody's talking to
somebody and you're like i'm not sure
why i watch that
but that low energy stuff
accumulates over the course of an
episode and then also over the course of
the arc of the entire show
and it is a freaking masterpiece
it's
it's very nearly the best thing i've
ever seen
on television
and i'll tell you what he does right um
so um
who is it sedacus who's the executive
producer and the star
i'll just give you the setup without
being a spoiler he plays an optimistic
american
who has chosen to be a soccer coach in a
british premier league and he's never
played soccer and he doesn't even know
the rules
now
what's the show about
if it's about an
american who is a coach in a different
uh in a different level in a different
sport
what's it about
persuasion
it's a whole show about persuasion
because this this person he has no
skills he has no experience
the only thing he knows is how to
motivate people
and you watch him as he uses one
persuasion trick after another
usually in a more you know dramatic
sense so they're exaggerated a little
bit but he uses one one trick after
another and you watch him build
build a thing over the course of the
shows
that's amazing
it's really amazing
it's the best
uh
ted lasso is it laszlo or lasso
right so it's ted lasso and it's uh
looks terrible in the previews so let me
say this as clearly as possible don't
look at the previews
don't look at them
it's not good
the previews cannot capture
the genius that went into this freaking
thing it's pure genius from beginning to
end the first episode you might not feel
it
at around the third episode you're going
to say to yourself what the hell am i
watching
this is so good
it's got layers it's like layers on
layers on layers
one of the things they do is what
i call the beatles technique i've been
studying the beatles for i don't know a
year now to find out what they did right
not just musically but like what was in
their systems or techniques it turns out
that both
mccartney and lennon were systems people
you know they they would develop a
system
that would get them there not just a
goal of having a good
good song and one of the systems was
they would take anything that sounded
good and put it in the same song even if
it didn't make sense
they say well this sounds good this is
this bell ringing ding dong
hey i like the way that bell sounds
and then you've got a guitar lick over
here
there you don't sound good we'll take
that bell
that i like individually we'll put it
with that guitar lick that i like
individually and we'll have a bell and a
guitar and we'll call it a song
and we'll add some random lyrics that
don't really have anything to do with
anything
that's how the the the beatles made
their songs they took individual things
that felt good and put them together
i don't know if anybody does that
um
but
but uh anyway this this show does that
because one of the things it takes is uh
bits from the best thing you've ever
watched
how many of you like shows where the
underdog
wins a sporting competition
right
don't you like
anything where the big underdog wins a
sporting competition or it could be a
spelling bee by any competition right
every movie that has that if they
execute it well
i like it so they throw that in there
that's intent lasso then you've got a
fish out of water
that's sort of the basis for most
humorous stuff that that's there
you've got persuasion
lessons
which is fun that's there you've got
great dialogue you've got the most
interesting character that's there
the casting is freaking genius
where do you see the casting
you need an academy award for just
casting that stupid thing
but every part of this is genius and the
parts aren't supposed to go together
and they put them together anyway they
just said take everything that's great
and put it in a show what's the thing i
hate worse about every any show
they make you feel bad
in order to make you feel good
right they have to they have to take the
viewer down into depression so that when
things go well you're like oh finally i
feel good now but this show makes you
feel good almost the whole way except
he's got some marital problems that are
kind of necessary to the to the plot
but otherwise you're just sort of happy
the whole time
it's amazing anyway watch that show you
won't you won't be disappointed and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
