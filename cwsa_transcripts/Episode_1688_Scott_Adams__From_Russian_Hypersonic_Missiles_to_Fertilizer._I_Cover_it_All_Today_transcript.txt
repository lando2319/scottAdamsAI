good morning everybody and
congratulations on a good start to your
day
because nothing is better than making it
live for coffee with scott adams no
there's one thing that's almost as good
listening to it recorded
and pretending it's live
just as good because reality is
subjective and don't ever forget it but
let's say you wanted to take things to a
stratospheric level a level never
achieved in any live stream before well
all you need is a copper mug or glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine here today the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip and watch how
amazing it is go
ah
yeah
wait wait
i don't do this often
perhaps i've never done it
but there's going to be a second step
because you need it today
you need it
go
somebody's calling this tantric sipping
i don't think that's far off
well in the news today progressive
leader uh jaipal
she's blaming corporate america for
raising gas prices
what do you think
do you blame corporate america and their
profiteering and
price gouging
well here's my take
if you hear anybody tell you doesn't
matter who it is
republican democrat doesn't matter who
if anybody tells you
that there's one reason for gas prices
going up
don't listen to them
that's the person you should never
listen to you should not be allowed to
talk in public
if you think that gas prices went up for
the one reason
there's more than one reason
pretty sure there's more than one
and if you can't speak to all of them
you should just be considered a liar
and maybe you should get on that list
of 50 intel
well we'll talk about the 50 intel wires
in a moment
all right
so
let's see
uh so things that cause gas prices to
change
you got the war in ukraine
you've got the uncertainty which is
partly because that you've got the uh
the problems with the supply chain
you've got the
biden administration tightening up on
what we can do domestically
um
and
you've got uh you know green energy
forces forever
making nuclear less
attractive up until now so basically
almost everything is wrong
essentially uh everything
let me let me speak to the comment i'm
saying
somebody is saying that it's all comes
down to supply and demand
in economics generally speaking
price comes down to supply and demand
no it doesn't
is anybody who actually has a degree in
economics believe that this is supply
and demand happening here
let me ask you this anybody who has a
degree in economics
you have to have a degree for just this
question if you have a degree in
economics do you think the price of oil
and gas is being caused by
supply and demand
no it's not
it's not
not in the short run
in the long run
in the long run supply and demand yes
not in the short run
in the short run all kinds of reasons
change prices
in the short run somebody's going to say
i will gouge you
because in the short run i have no
competition
right
so i mean that is i guess that's supply
and demand but in the
but you have a psychology working and a
lack of information
so what you're really seeing is a lack
of information
not a supply problem
so if you have uncertainty
about supply
that's that that acts the same as a lack
of supply does that make sense
if you have uncertainty psychological
uncertainty about future supply
it affects the price
without the actual supply changing
do you understand that
now
in in most if not
almost all cases
the psychology of what's going to happen
matches the actuality right so lots of
times the psychology and the actual
thing move together
but with
the short term
and the fog of war and so many big
variables in motion at the same time
from pandemic to supply chains to
ukraine to god knows what
it is uncertainty
largely that's driving crisis
is there anybody with a an economics
degree
who would disagree with my statement
that of course supply and demand matters
in the long run of course that's the
main thing in the long run
but in the short run
it's psychology
anybody want to disagree
yeah i think everybody with an economics
degree just agreed with me i think
so so as soon as you think it's supply
and demand you're a little bit lost
you'd be a little bit lost if you think
that's all that's going on there's a
whole bunch of stuff going on
but it's mostly psychological
um which could become real i mean if if
people's
guesses about the future are right then
it becomes real but they are guesses
all right i'm going to teach you how to
evaluate studies
because there um there's a new study on
and i hate to go back to this
but it's just a little mop up
i i swear i'll make it short
there's a new
biggest and best to study on ivermectin
that says it has no impact at all
how does that make you feel
now
i'll talk about the flaws in a moment
i'm not going to ignore the flaws
um
but how does it make you feel
i'm looking at your comments now and
we'll talk about those the comments are
who funded it uh they didn't include
zinc
uh was the protocol right we'll talk
about that
all right let me teach you how to
determine if a study is correct or not
because the
is also true if you didn't know this
that um
the hydroxyl cooler queen studies
largely stopped in 2020
uh because there was one big data set
that said it wasn't working and then
everybody stopped their their tests
but here's here's how to tell if any
studies are effective
now
you're probably saying to yourself
well if it's a peer-reviewed study
i'm going to believe it
but we don't really live in a world
where you can believe a peer-reviewed
study
so i'm going to teach you how to
determine if a study is credible it's
very simple
does the study agree with my opinion
that i've already stated
if yes we call that a gold standard
kind of a study
if
if the new study disagrees
with my prior opinion
that's an example of a a flawed study
so studies that disagree with you
have methodological problems which we'll
discuss
so
if you use this guide i don't think it's
ever it's ever failed you know there's
some kinds of rules of thumb i give you
where the rule of thumb is you know 90
of the time it works but you have to
watch out for that 10
this isn't like this
this is one of the few standards or
rules that works every time
in fact i've lived a long time i've
never seen this not work
this has worked
every time
and if you don't believe me just ask
anybody
who's evaluating any study
anybody who evaluates any study will
agree that this standard works it works
every time
so
when you're looking at the ivermectin
study
you might have said something like this
scott no one ever claimed ivermectin
worked alone
you have to put the ivormectin
with the other early treatment things to
get an impact scott scott scott have you
never heard of an aids cocktail
it's the combination of things that make
them work it's not
it's not the one thing by itself
scott
no no
so that's one of the complaints
um
someone said it's not peer-reviewed it's
not peer-reviewed it's only been
submitted for peer review
that means something
do you know how much more credibility
you will get if it gets peer-reviewed
and passes
you know what would be the extra
credibility
from something that's submitted versus
peer-reviewed
what's the extra bump you get after the
peer review
 zero
all right if you haven't been paying
attention let me inform you
that the peer review
should add something
it should i mean on paper it makes sense
right
in reality
nothing
so if your complaint is that it's not
peer-reviewed
you imagine the peer review adds
something
you should
like logically it should but in the real
world i don't think it actually does i
think it's just somebody who's busy who
looks at the top line stuff looks at a
couple numbers and says yeah i don't say
anything obviously wrong with it that's
about it
um
here's some other complaints
valid enough that it was only a
three-day dose
to which i say
i'm no doctor
but if you couldn't see the difference
in three days
for a drug which is supposedly from its
its uh
its proponents
say that ivermectin is so darn effective
that three days would pretty much
eliminate it in you
but they saw no difference after three
days
um doesn't mean it's right i'm just
telling you what the study said
someone else said that there's a
separate study
that shows that when you combine
divermectin with antibiotics you do get
a good effect
so really scott
testing ivermectin alone is really not a
good test
you should have tested it with the
antibiotics
to which i say i'm no doctor
but i'll bet you i could do a study that
showed that antibiotics and potato chips
give you a good result does anybody want
to doubt it
if i did a study
that said if i gave you antibiotics and
potato chips
do you think that you would show a
difference
i think you would and not because the
antibiotics work with covent because
apparently they don't
it's because the antibiotics might work
on some other problem you have because a
lot of people have other problems
and if it improves the other problem
some bacterial problems let's say
it might make your immune system a
little bit stronger and you might get
better better results so yes testing
ivermectin and antibiotics i'm glad they
tested it but i would expect exactly the
same result as potato chips and
antibiotics
that's what i'd expect i mean i haven't
tested it
um
now remember
that the uh
oh and then somebody else said it didn't
include zinc
but i don't believe that the proponents
of of ivermectin ever claimed it
required zinc
and we don't and
and
we haven't seen it
you know ivermectin being called a
delivery system for zinc
we heard hydroclax hydroxychloroquine
so
here's a general rule i'm also going to
give you
it goes like this
if there's something that you think is
true
on day one
but you don't have any way to test for
sure it just has lots of indications
that might be true on day one
is it reasonable to say well i don't
know for sure but let's let's treat it
seriously
yes
yes if you have lots of indications that
are non-scientific that something works
and it's important you know it's a
there's a big problem
you should take it pretty seriously
now what happens
if uh months and months have gone by and
lots and lots of tasks and you get to
the end of that and there's still no
proof
well i would use the following standard
hello all you clankers
i would use the following standard
that
extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof
would you all accept that the base
before i go on
that extraordinary claims re require
extraordinary proof now on day one
on day one when somebody makes an
extraordinary claim can you
realistically ask them to produce proof
not really
because it's brand new
but if you've gone two years
and nobody can produce anything that
looks like proof
what would you say about the
extraordinary claim i think it's an
extraordinary claim that there would be
an available widely available drug
that everybody could have that would
just basically shut down the whole
pandemic that's an extraordinary claim
right
well would you disagree with me that
that's an extraordinary claim
whether it's true or false it's
extraordinary
right
so an extraordinary claim requires an
extraordinary proof
it's been two years
and nobody's come close
and the most recent best quality proof
says it doesn't work
what would you now give i'm going to ask
you a following question and i want you
to give it in percentage is
right everybody who says yes or no
is wrong
everybody who gives me a percentage
might be wrong but at least you're the
thinking right
right so given current information given
two years of not being able to show that
divermectin works
tell me what your odds are that
ivermectin does work and we just haven't
proved it yet
what are the odds that ivormectin does
work
i'm going to read your numbers they're
from 5 to
50 but you seem to be settling in around
a 20 range most of you
if i if i average your numbers i'm just
eyeballing them
uh
on the on the locals platform
a lot of people are saying 75 percent
but others are saying 5
200
100
the the youtube people are uh not being
useful right now
all right
so
uh i just leave you with this standard
and i'll i'll let you
sort of wrestle with this over time
so remember the standard is and i'm not
saying the standard works every time
you know i i probably should say that
about everything i say
which is this won't work every time
that's just true of everything almost
everything
all right
i think it's fascinating that we have
this list of 50 intel
prior intel officials who said that the
hunter laptop was russian disinformation
and now that we know it wasn't and we
know they had no evidence to back their
claim
we have an actual list of 50 intel liars
how useful is that
you know usually you're wondering like
who to trust
but how useful is it that we have an
actual list of 50 people who put their
name on a list
to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that
they will lie to you in public about the
most important things
that's kind of useful
and what you know what's the funniest
part
the first four names on the list of
known
credentialed liars
are four of the most common people you'd
ever see on cnn
clapper hayden leon panetta and john
brennan
in fact panetta was on there yesterday
cnn had leon panetta on there
right after
he had been proven on a list of 50 uh
documented gigantic liars
and remember that the hudson biden
laptop lie
is a special kind of lie because it's so
bold
it's so bold you can't really i don't
think you can wonder whether they were
just wrong
can you
does anybody think oh they were just
they had an opinion and they were just
wrong
does anybody believe that
that's that would be pretty hard to
believe
i suppose anything's possible there are
50 people there there's somebody on that
list of 50 who who just believed that
they were right
but it seems very unlikely that the top
four
clapper hayden panetta and brennan
do you do you think the top four
didn't know it was real
really
really
they didn't know it was real
really
they knew it was real of course and they
just lied to the public
so
it is just so
oh my god it's just so ballsy for cnn to
put one of the people on that list ever
on the air again
how does john brennan ever get on the
air again these are these are literally
at least these top four guys
correct me if i'm wrong but these are
the russia collusion liars aren't they
aren't they the same liars who said
russia collusion was totally real
how many times do the same people have
to lie to us
get caught
in a way that's you know unambiguously
you've proven that they lied
this is really bad stuff
compare this kind of lie
to anything trump ever lied about
do you see the difference
when trump
uh quote lies
and often it's in the form of hyperbole
it's a little bit transparent isn't it
like if you see trump talking about
you can't watch television because your
windmill isn't isn't turning
do you
is there any is there any actual lie
there
well yes yes there's a lie in the sense
that clearly trump knows that the tv
doesn't go off when the wind stops
blowing
i mean not literally
i mean he knows that so yeah yeah you
could say that was a lie
or you could say it's hyperbole or yeah
you could say it's just a joke
but
i don't think that
i really don't think that trump's lies
have the quality that these lies do
these lies were a genuine attempt to
bamboozle the country on something that
really mattered
i can't think of an example of a trump
lie
that had weight
let's see if you can
and by the way i'm i'm just spitballing
here because there might be an example i
don't know is there an example of a
trump lie
that's documented as a lie as as well
documented as these are
and also was important to the country
like it actually mattered
uh
somebody's saying that trump didn't lie
he exaggerated i i think you know 80 of
it is sales and hyperbole and
exaggeration yes
the stolen election
this trump is not lying about the stolen
election it's a belief
and
is that different than the 50 intel
people who said they
they are sure
that uh the laptop was disinformation
maybe it's not that different
because in a sense the 50 intel people
were saying it's their opinion
but they didn't really present it like
opinion did they
i know it does seem different here's why
it seems different
we do distinguish between experts and
politicians
am i right
if an expert says
the election was stolen or a lot of
experts you say oh that seems pretty
serious if a politician says an election
was stolen you don't give that too much
weight do you
i think it's different
so i would say that the you know if you
just say lies or lies
and i i can see why somebody would have
that philosophy but if you just say all
lies are equal
i don't think you're understanding the
situation correctly
these 50 intel people lied in a way
that's
i i mean it's just jaw-droppingly
outrageously
dangerous to have people like this have
any impact on the country
whereas uh trump was more entertaining
you know his lives usually were funny
and they made a point
you know it's a whole different standard
so russia fired a hypersonic missile
i was not fully aware of how good their
hypersonic stuff is so the russian
military equipment seems to be poorly
maintained and maybe not the best stuff
but i guess they have actually some
advantages in hypersonic missiles
so they've got these hypersonic missiles
that you can't see until it's too late
and they're way too fast to stop
basically they're invulnerable
so they have a missile that's if it
wants to carry a nuclear warhead it's
going to get you
right
now so you've got mutually assured
destruction and
and russia used it to take down some
arms alleged arms bunker or something in
ukraine
but there's a little bit of disagreement
about whether russia was just proving
they have the weapon
and could have done the same attack with
lesser weapons
or
did they actually need that weapon
because it was a bunker
so i saw one expert say yeah they
probably thought they needed that weapon
because it was a bunker and the
hypersonic missile has enough kinetic
energy to penetrate it
so you have to penetrate it before you
blow up or it's not that good
maybe
i know
uh i'm not sure that a
mother of all bomb kind of bomb wouldn't
take in a bunker i think it would
i don't know i think it would
can somebody answer that question
if a mother of all bombs type of bomb is
dropped on a bunker
no matter how deep the bunker is in
reasonable sense you know a reasonable
wartime bunker it's going to take it out
right
am i wrong
that might be wrong
somebody says no that it wouldn't take
him
is that because the explosion would be
limited to the surface whereas the
missile would penetrate before it
explodes
they're called a wheel well we do have
bunker busting
bombs yes i assume russia has those
all right so that's open question
um
what else we got here so i told you
about there was a long thread on twitter
that was excellent from trent tolenko
talking about uh truck tire maintenance
because he was a he was somebody who did
this kind of work in the u.s military
and he was noting that the tires and the
tire maintenance on the russian
equipment seems poor
and that that was going to be a huge
problem their their equipment would be
breaking down we've got a new new thread
i'm not going to detail it but the
bottom line is
lots more
um lots more evidence that the russian
army is becoming
operationally
stuck
and there's something called operational
attrition
which is that your stuff breaks
just by being in use
and it's hard to replace it fast
so
this guy who's a an expert on
maintenance of big military equipment
he he estimated that we might be just a
few weeks away
from the russian army just collapsing
because their equipment will just be
just garbage in about three weeks now
part of this is that they are poorly
maintained the claim here is that the
u.s military is obsessive about
maintenance and we have like an entire
you know an entire organization just to
do maintenance and they they maintain
regularly so they're just maintaining
maintaining like crazy
but the russian army basically doesn't
even have that organization
they've just got conscripts that are
told to change the oil
i'm exaggerating but you know something
like that so they don't have as a
professional a maintenance
group and it seems to be showing
and it looks like they don't have the
ability to
resupply etc
and at this point if ukraine can hold
for
i don't know
five or six weeks
do you think kiev can hold out for five
or six weeks
because it's looking like they can
but if they hold out for five or six
weeks the entire russian army will start
becoming
immobile it just it won't have supplies
it won't be maintained it just won't be
able to move the roads will be bombed so
as soon as the ukrainians have them
completely trapped in country here's
what i predict
that
day after day the ukrainians will
you know being quite aggressive and
having great weapons
they will surround and destroy
one mechanized unit after another
until russia can't handle the pain
anymore
now i think the ukrainians have already
discounted
all destruction of their country
that's what i think now there's no way
to know this i'm just making a
a mental leap and a lot of mind reading
but i believe that the ukrainians have
sort of
factored into their decision that they
will lose every building and
infrastructure in ukraine
and they're still going to fight
am i right
i mean i could be wrong about this but
it feels like the ukrainians have just
said okay the thing you're going to do
to us is kill a lot of us
and destroy everything that we own is
that right
and putin would say that's damn right if
you don't surrender i will kill a lot of
you and i'll destroy every building in
your country and every infrastructure
and the ukrainians just said
bring it on
they just said bring it on
and i think they meant it
now
as naval pointed out not too long ago on
twitter
that a motivated uh
motivated defenders with uh really good
supply lines
are unbeatable
as long as you have supply lines and
somebody's willing to keep supplying it
indefinitely
and you're motivated you just can't be
beaten
because you can't kill everybody
and there's still going to be plenty of
people who will pick up a shoulder
mounted thing and keep fighting
so i think the thing that putin
miscalculated is how much
pain the ukrainians were willing to take
to get what they want
am i right
the big miscalculation i think
aside from how well the ukrainians would
be equipped i think that was a
miscalculation but the other
miscalculation is that the ukrainians
they don't seem like regular people to
me
i know it could be that the propaganda
is catching up with me i think that's
that's happening
but
it looks
like the ukrainians would fight to the
last
last brick
it looks like it i mean if if the only
thing they're doing is sending that
message that they're going to fight for
the last brick
that's pretty good persuasion but they
certainly sent that message
um here's the biggest thing i'm worried
about and have been for a number of
years even before the ukraine thing
there is a
big problem with a shortage of
fertilizer
so
uh and i've known about this for maybe
seven years or so that
that the world was running out of
fertilizer materials and we didn't have
a way to fix it now i usually
employ the adams rule of slow moving
disasters
and they say yeah
we think we're going to run out of
fertilizer but somebody will figure out
how to make more
you know we'll figure it out because we
have enough time and everybody sees it's
a problem
but then you have a war
and the war happens to affect the
fertilizer you know
development or manufacturing in one
country it's a pretty big deal
so suddenly
you took a a problem that was already a
sort of brewing big problem and you
added a war on top of it and shoot
you're out of fertilizer and then
everything falls apart
fertilizer kind of holds the world
together
and
i tweeted now this is not a solution but
it's the sort of thing that can happen
there's a company that's taking co2
from generators you know capturing uh
the source from at the uh
the waste source
and turning it into sustainable
fertilizers
so you can actually turn co2 into
fertilizer
now it didn't say they could do the same
thing by uh sucking co2 out of the air
where
i think you'd get more of it that way
but maybe you get more of it just
attaching it to the stack you know the
smoke stack or whatever i don't know
but
um in the case of an emergency which i
believe we've entered fertilizer-wise
and i don't think that this company
let's see what's the name of the company
ccam technologies i don't know that
they've proven they can do it
economically but they have proven
they have proven they can turn co2 into
fertilizer
now what would happen if our two biggest
problems solved each other
that might be happening
wait a minute if you put co2
on plants as fertilizer
does that just
reduce does that
are you going to end up just releasing
the co2
all right so here's the question
could you solve the fertilizer problem
and the climate change problem at the
same time
could you
can you suck co2 out of the air and turn
it into fertilizer
i'm starting to think you can
now i don't know if you could do it
economically but if if the world runs
out of fertilizer then the economics
change completely
if
somebody says climate change is
so they don't need any more fertilizer
okay i get it
i get your joke
now i'm not not going to predict that
this is the solution to everything but
it's the kind of ways
that you can go from doom to a good
situation and a war can get you there
if there were no war
i doubt we'd put as much attention into
turning co2 into fertilizer
so it could be that the war in ukraine
solves climate change
and also solves the fertilizer shortage
in my opinion
possibly the two biggest problems in the
world
we could have solved them both
right i mean it's possible i don't think
the economics would be easy to work out
but it's possible
um
oh interesting so john carroll is saying
uh he has a farm
where he uh
basically fertilizes the plants with the
animal waste and it all works out
maybe that maybe that's the trick maybe
the trick is to get the animal farms and
the plant farms closer together
i don't know maybe maybe that's a lot of
the trick
all right
um
i think it was uh ian bremmer
suggesting that maybe biden should go to
kev
because there were three nato leaders
that went to cave kiev kev
kiev
and
are you surprised that anybody can go
into kiev how the hell do you get there
how in the world could you get a
president of the united states into the
middle of a war zone into a surrounded
city
fly you know i get it you fly he's not
going to walk
but
uh
is that safe
use a green screen right
i here's my opinion
i do think biden should go to kiev
but he's not the only one
i think jesse smollett
should go to kiev
i think that
all of the criminals in seattle
should go to kiev
i think i think there are actually lots
of people i'd like to see to go to kiev
but um
not anybody that we want to save
no nobody that we want to save abide
sure
you know i'm starting to think that
cyber war is uh overrated
how could we be this far into the russia
ukraine situation
and not seeing any serious cyber attacks
what's going on here
is it possible that we're better at
defending against cyber attacks than we
thought maybe especially during war
maybe they watch it closer
or
is somebody holding out on the good
stuff
or
are there
cyber attacks that are working and we're
not hearing about it
now i know that anonymous the hacker
group anonymous
has been doing a lot of denial of
service attacks on russia
but they had one notable success some
hacker or hackers hacked into a russian
tv network and put on a short video clip
that replaced the normal programming to
tell people what's really happening in
ukraine
so somebody a hacker actually got
control of like
uh i think it was 20 minutes
of live air time
how do you do that
so that sounds like something with an
insider doesn't it
i don't think you could do that without
an insider
how in the world
could you do that
that that just doesn't sound like
something a hacker could do
i think i'm going to go further and say
there's no way that that happened
externally i think that was an internal
thing
in other words somebody involved with
the station must have pushed a button i
don't think you could hack that into
being but maybe
maybe
they did that to one of giuliani's
broadcast too
was giuliani's broadcast on
a network
was it on a network or was on like a
streaming service
yeah i guess i have some
questions
where's q and what does q say
fox news audio keeps cutting out in
canada interesting
that one was proven false as somebody
says
oh is it proven false that somebody
hacked the tv station because
yeah
because i don't i don't feel like
that story is too credible
even though it ha it actually happened i
think we do have uh
information that it was hacked but i
don't think it was necessarily anonymous
um
so
am i wrong that maybe the cyber attacks
from russia either are not being
they're not happening or they don't
really work
the chef is back in ukraine oh is he
the chef was the
oligarch who is very close to putin
right
and and he he had the troll farm
i think that's who the chef was
but i don't know if he's really in
ukraine that's just a comment
all right um
servant of the people
all right that is uh
let me check my notes checking
notes that's about all that was
happening today
and
is there anything else i missed
so who shut down the east coast pipeline
last year now those were
uh um
male hackers
and so here's a question i have
if you're a black male kind of a hacker
where you're trying to shut down
something in black male and we know that
happens and we know that they get into
serious stuff
how long does it take that kind of
attack
to develop in other words do you have to
develop sources within the company
could
in in the context of war
and let's say you had two months to do
something
could you figure out how to hack
something major in two months
or
here's my question
or do the
the blackmail ransomware hackers
do they just try to hack everything they
can until they find something
because they're not really hacking um
government stuff they tend to be getting
into private stuff right
so
uh they aren't targeted
yeah so right
so if you have every company and every
system in the world to choose from
and you try to attack as many as
possible and you get lucky and you get
into one
the law of large numbers is of course if
you're trying to attack everything that
exists you're going to find some
weaknesses
but
if you're ukraine and you know you're
going to get a cyber attack on your
electrical grid just to pick an example
couldn't you protect that completely
if you knew it was a target and an
imminent target
probably you could
somebody says no i guess it would depend
on the vulnerability right
it would depend on the vulnerability but
at the very least you'd think they'd
have some kind of a system that would
you know wipe out its own software and
reinstall it if it had a problem or
something like that
ransomware works by fishing mostly
interesting so that the fishing
if ransomware where works by fishing the
idea that you send fake emails to
employees
and ask them for their you know ask them
for their credentials to hack into
something i think that's what you're
talking about
that would
that would require a length of time
because you might not get that kind of
thing on the first try
might take you
two tries
uh
so it probably doesn't work so well in
the context of war when you're working
on one target and you're in a hurry
the the fishing thing doesn't seem like
that works
fast
it worked on podesta
yeah but that wasn't also a
podesta didn't have you know credentials
to the infrastructure
you know the electric grid
it was just an email credential
all right
that is all i have for today
i'm pretty sure that this changed your
life in a positive way
um
and uh now that you have this standard
for knowing how to interpret scientific
studies you're in good shape
because before you were just wandering
blind in the in the desert but now
if the study agrees with you
that's good science
and
i'm going to go do some other stuff
important things
and i would like you
to enjoy
the beginning of the golden age
i i actually do think this is the
beginning of the golden age
let me summarize that for a moment
the war in ukraine as awful as it is
should be
the the takeaway from this i think
is going to be that you can't attack an
industrialized country
because if you do
you're not going to win it's going to
blow your economy up and the economic
sanctions will take you apart
i do think you can still attack a lesser
developed country
and get away with it
but i don't think you can attack a
ukraine
or anything like it and i think that the
this is going to prove it
that's good
that's really good in the same way that
dropping
nuclear bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki
was incredibly bad
for the people who got bombed and for
maybe humanity's soul
but
it probably kept us out of some other
nuclear wars because people got to see
just how bad these weapons were
so the golden age interpretation
is that the ukraine war will be horrible
for now
but will prove maybe forever that that
kind of war can never work
that's good
what happens if our shortage of
fertilizer because of the war
increases the energy put into taking co2
out of the air and turning it into
fertilizer that'd be really good
um
oh it never went through the networks
somebody said the hacker attack was kind
of overrated
that makes sense
um
here's some other uh
good news
it is entirely possible
that uh crypto becomes more powerful
because of the the forces that we've
seen recently that could be good
especially the blockchain stuff
it could be
that
we now know how to handle pandemics in
the future one of the biggest risks to
humanity could be in much better shape
now
that's good it could be that
uh not only do we learn how to take co2
out of the air and fix climate change
but it turns into valuable products etc
and so
um
it seems to me that everything bad
that's happening now
is a clear incentive
for the good thing to replace it
take for example uh nasa was a mouse
and then we get into war with
russia and russia would no longer be
seen as a
good source
for sending stuff to the international
space station
but there's spacex
there's elon musk
so his business gets a pop
that's good too
so it seems to me
that although the news looks pretty darn
bad
every one of those bad news
news
every one of those bad pieces of news is
very closely matched
with a probable solution that would be a
beneficial to society forever
so if we can get past the inflation
which won't be easy
and we can figure a way past the
fertilizer
i think everything else is going to work
out and those two things i think we can
fix or at least we can we can weather
them
i live in a time when we could put a
helicopter on mars it's true
we did
um
and so
i say to you
that we're in a pretty good place
but we're not quite there yet
so
that is all i've got for today in that
upbeat thought
and thank you christo and i'll see you
on youtube tomorrow
