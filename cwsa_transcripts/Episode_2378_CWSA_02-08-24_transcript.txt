good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
pretty sure you've never had a better
time if you'd like to take this up to a
level which I don't even think the news
can understand all you need is a cup or
a mug or a glass a tankered chalice or
Stein a canteen jug or a flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure dopamine end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go
delightful well I'm going to give you
some uh various new stories
today but for your pleasure I will be
summarizing them into a theme uh closer
to the end and I figured out what's
wrong with
everything have you all noticed that
there's something going on that seems
bigger than
politics and I finally figured out what
it is so I'm going to pull it all
together before we get to the end here
all right let's start with a a little
thing I like to
call backwards science backwards science
that science it shows you a correlation
that might not be exactly what you think
it is in today's science we find out
that uh people who use erectile
dysfunction drugs have 18% lower alzer's
risk or is
it backwards science there's backwards
science let me ask you
this say you took a bunch of uh senior
citizens and you can put me in the mix
you do a lineup and I'm in your lineup
and it's all people my age
and you say take off all your clothes
and you're like ah no God nobody wants
to see that but it's for science you
have to so I'm going to line up with a
bunch of people my age we all take off
our
clothes and uh the question of the
people who are viewing is this which one
of these people is likely to have sex in
the next
year
[Laughter]
right the the people who are likely to
have seet
are the ones who look like they might
live for another year or
two they also in many cases might want a
little boost on the old erectile
dysfunction drug so wouldn't you expect
that the healthiest people we already
know there's a correlation between
General good health and not getting
Alzheimer's wouldn't you expect that the
people who are the
most
sexable would be the ones who also look
the healthiest at the age that they are
and so wouldn't you expect that the
people who are having the most sex
whether or not they needed a you know a
little extra would still be the ones who
had the least Alzheimer's wouldn't you
expect that but no it looks like just
possibly I'm just guessing that maybe
somebody who is involved in oh I don't
know selling one of these drugs or
manufacturing it I wonder if they had
anything to do with the funding of the
study do you know because I don't
know if you don't know who funded this
study about a Pharma product that turns
out well not only does it do what it was
supposed to do but it could even make
you live longer
happier okay this is the kind of science
that you should not believe at all
moving
on we've got a climate change update
from CBS News turns out that according
to CBS and other uh mainstream news that
January and 2023 was the hottest year on
record and it's not even
over um actually last month was the
warmest
January
because and we know this is true because
science can measure the temperature of
the
world does anybody believe that how how
many people believe that a science can
measure the temperature of the world and
then compare it to all the other
years someday we're going to laugh at
that that it's someday that story is
going to be like you know when we
thought cigarettes were good for your
health because that actually was a Thing
Once yeah we're going to laugh at the
fact that we thought we could measure it
with
thermometers and you know the
thermometers end up being next to
airport reports and there's just a 100
problems with
anyway maybe it's right by the way I'm
not denying climate change how would I
know the the only information I have
about climate change comes from science
and the news reporting on the science
which one of those is credible the
science or the news reporting on the
science which one of those no those are
both completely non-credible sources you
agree right you can't trust societ sence
for sure and you definitely can't trust
the news talking about the science you
know your best case scenario is that the
science is fake but the news is so
stupid they talk about it opposite of
what it was actually the science and
then they reverse it and they
accidentally get the story right because
they made a mistake on the mistake you
know two wrongs can make a
right you know they always tell you two
wrongs can't can't make a right but
there's so many situations in which it
does for example killing a
murderer I don't know does that make me
worse off I don't know I feel like two
wrongs made a right or at least made a
wrer toward the end
wrer all right
um let's talk about
fenel uh Robert deiro you might know
tragically not too long ago lost his
grandson and and uh he agonizes over
what he should have done now you know
you you probably all know I lost my
stepson five years ago to
fenel and it's natural that you wonder
what could I have done differently and
all that well let me tell you one thing
that won't help at all
voting voting won't help you because we
had Trump that didn't make any
difference we had Biden that didn't make
any difference so the one thing you
could tell for for sure is it won't make
any difference what you vote
for for
reasons that I might get into a little
bit later in this presentation we don't
seem to have a government that is either
willing or able to do anything and it
doesn't seem to matter which president
isn't
there so what's up with
that probably exactly what you
think well there's a funny story about
will Weeden who is the who was a actor
on Star Trek do you know all know will
he kind of a liberal act activist type
he's he's quite mad that actor comedian
Larry David uh comedically strangled the
Elmo puppet on some Morning Show just
sort of jokingly grabbed it and
strangled it and will weaton was
triggered by that because his father
used to grab him and Shake him and so he
wrote a a very long piece uh hating on
Larry David for the horrible horrible
Act of strangling
Elmo now a lot of people don't know but
Elmo is not
real he's not even
real if there's anybody who didn't know
that I thought that was worth putting in
there so that was in the news
today that was in the
news that will Wheaton's real mad
at H David for strangling a puppet all
right well that's the most important
thing that happened
today so the libs of Tik tock if you're
not familiar with that account um mostly
reposts things that left leaning people
who have posted themselves so Libs of
Tik Tok doesn't make stuff up they just
show you things that are also on social
media that maybe you didn't see because
they're kind of
outrageous and for doing that um she had
predicted that uh the news would come
after her and now NBC News did a piece
uh where there
they're basically saying now this is the
libs of tiktock um the person the woman
who runs it this is her take she says
they're now openly saying that their
goal is to frame me for bomb threats and
get law enforcement to investigate me so
NBC News does this piece that says that
people that are mentioned in the libs of
Tik Tock posts often get bomb threats
and therefore NBC News has decided that
the problem is not that people are
engaged in such bad behavior that other
people want to blow them
up like that that doesn't seem to be a
problem you you should probably ask why
do so many people want to blow them up
with bombs because that's not even an
ordinary thing it's not even something
we do it's not it's not very much an
American practice whatsoever but
apparently these people are getting a
lot of bombs threats most of them are
not real of course they're just threats
uh but still it's plenty uh plenty
distressing now I'm completely opposed
to bomb threats don't do any bomb
threats because you saw something on a
post it's very bad behavior it's not
really helping
you um however when NBC News packages it
up as a story it turns it into a cause
to investigate the libs of Tik Tock for
what NBC News would say is helping to
create a list of people to Target with
bomb
threats wait what this is somebody
simply reporting on these strange things
that are happening on social media that
are already public she doesn't do
investigative reporting she literally
shows you what's already public because
you know it's just shocking sometimes to
see that it's actually out there and for
that simply being person who shows you
things that are already public what it
does is it gives a it's a convenience
for people who want to do bad things so
they can look at her posts and say oh
here's somebody I might want to do a
bomb threat to or some terrible thing
and so therefore you know maybe law
enforcement should look into her oh my
God now does this look like to you a
news organization which is doing just
doing a news thing or does it seem like
um political activism to take out one of
the strongest voices against the
left it looks like political activism
now has anybody ever blamed um NBC
news of not being a legitimate news
entity yes people say that it's a
CIA Democrat organ that is in the
business of fake news so does this look
like a real news story or does this
something look like something that they
did in a political season to take out a
political active person it's an OP I
mean to me it just looks like an OP now
that doesn't mean that the you know the
CIA had a meeting with him or anything
because I think everybody knows what to
do they don't need any
orders um but
wow yeah and also the Chia the the woman
who runs the account she's of course
getting her own death threats so do we
have freedom of speech in this country
yes or no do we have freedom of speech
no no this is a clear example where NBC
which we believe to be government
Affiliated I can't prove it but that's
the general belief in the public is is
trying to stop the free speech of of an
American citizen right in front of you
like right in front of
you all right um there's now a new tool
to find the Soros prosecutors there's a
the law enforcement legal defense
fund uh put together an interactive map
where you can see on the map of the
United States all the prosecutors that
Soros
funded
and you know you keep hearing these
stories about there some how
many am I correct that there have been
two stories recently of a Soros
prosecutor who gave U money to her
boyfriend there're two of them right I'm
getting all the stories confused but can
you confirm there are now two stories in
the news of as
Soros is Soros
prosecutors who were paying their
boyfriends so I saw that there's this
interactive map and I I thought oh I'm
gonna I'm going to you know go in there
and see if I've got a Soros and sure
enough um Oakland so that handles my
area uh the prosecutor is a Soros funded
uh she's a black woman who's according
to the uh law enforcement legal defense
fund uh hired her
boyfriend she hired her
boyfriend so and she got a million
dollars they say from Soros in
funding um in 2023 there were 70 Chief
prosecutors linked to
Soros
70 did you have any idea it was that big
I was thinking a
dozen you know just from the reporting I
thought oh man there must be a dozen of
these in the big cities there's 70 of
them now do we have a system in which uh
the citizens of the United States select
people and they you know they build a
system that works for the country no it
appears that Soros has found a hack to
hack our system so that our system no
longer involves you know the people
deciding how to rule themselves it's
George Soros deciding how to use his
money to create facts on the ground that
nobody voted for well people did voted
for it but you can make anybody get
elected if you have
money oh my God are you really gonna say
he is
Jewish like that that's the comment that
fits in this in this story right now
like here's something I like you to do
for me because I know I always get the
the anti-semites flooding in I need you
to find me something that makes your uh
your
Jewish conspiracy theory more believable
than
UFOs you know the UFO problem huh it's
funny the whistleblowers are not the
people who have touched them they're
only the people talked to people who say
they've seen them h Huh why can't we get
a good photograph of all these UFOs
they're everywhere can't get one good
photograph can't can't show me a piece
nobody in the government's actually seen
them themselves kind of suspicious after
all this time isn't it well here's what
I'd like you to do if you believe
there's a worldwide Jewish
conspiracy I would like you to find some
uh leaked emails from their
meetings and find me a whistleblower who
used to be in the club but now says oh
I'm I'm against this big Jewish
conspiracy because those surely exist
right uh unless you're believing
something that's just batshit crazy I
mean all these years all these thousands
of people involved you've got some
whistleblowers by now and not only that
but leaked documents and videos must be
plenty right so why don't you show me
some of that or shut the up for the
rest of your life because I really don't
want to see this ever again I mean
really do you have to say Jew every
 story every story you
got to yell Jew it's a
Jew I mean you're boring me if nothing
else but if you can't get a little bit
more just a little bit more meat on your
 conspiracy theory can you just
leave it alone just leave it away from
me right I mean you can have your free
speech of course but why do you have to
inject it in every top
IC in every topic what's up with that I
just got accused of me having TDS do you
think this is me having TDS right I'm
the one who yells Jewish Conspiracy
Theory with no evidence whatsoever every
 story and that then that makes
me with the one with TDS that's that's
your that's your analysis and that makes
sense to
you all right moving on um
Mike Tyson said that he was younger he
was an allout liberal I'm not sure when
he said this it might have been a while
ago might have been recently I'm not
quite sure but he said as I get older I
look at my children I see what's in the
world and I get a little conservative
it's Common Sense he says you know it
made me
wonder um it made me
wonder does anybody ever get more
liberal as they
age have you ever seen that
I've never seen a I don't think I've
ever seen it oh Joe Scarboro that
doesn't count using the
media Madonna
no all right um it's just a question
because I wonder how do people who are
liberal process the fact that it only
works in One Direction that the more
experience you get
get the better your brain is developed
the more things you've seen in the
world why does it always go in One
Direction shouldn't that tell you
something is isn't there a clue in there
about something but people aren't seeing
it all right so uh let's two Jet Blue
planes collided on the ground in Logan
Airport how do how do planes Collide on
the ground unless there's massive
incompetence
and what would cause this massive
incompetence well in a completely
unrelated
story uh mat Matt Walsh has obtained
internal footage of senior officials at
the
FAA um trying to figure out how to have
fewer white males in aviation so they're
quite direct about it they want to
reduce the number of white males and
they want to increase you know promote
people from I guess the baggage area to
Pilot and they they've got quite a
program to make sure that the trans
trans
Pilots you know have uh full
support now do you think that the the
move to Dei has caused a lack of
competence in any of our
systems do you believe that are you all
racists really what kind of a racist are
you to believe that desperately trying
to find your pilots from a limited pool
of
people gives you a bad result why would
you think that because of
math yeah of course it's obvious there's
only one way this can go now I do think
you know maybe they have good intentions
no they don't they're racist they're all
racist so the FAA is completely racist
as are the entire Airlines and I would
have some real problems flying now I've
never been afraid of flying because
historically it's always been safer than
most most things and usually usually my
Common Sense can override any irrational
fears about being in the air in a giant
piece of metal which is kind of weird if
you think about
it but I would say that I'm actually
genuinely concerned about flying now as
in not just saying that for political
reasons you know not trying to make some
dramatic point I'm
actually actually literally concerned
about flying never have been before
did you see Hillary Clinton on MSNBC
talking about
Putin and she said there are people in
this country right now who are like
fifth column for Vladimir Putin they're
Putin's puppets and so it's it's all
about uh Tucker being over there now I'd
like to call your attention to something
I call liar
face and the Democrats all have a liar
face that has some things things in
common and you want to look for it
number one is they bug their eyes out
too
far and then they have a smile that
doesn't match the rest of their face do
you know what a sociopath smile looks
like when a real person Smiles their
eyes and their mouth are matched like
it's almost like your eyes are smiling
smiling when your mouth Smiles that's a
real person when the mouth Smiles but
the eyes are doing something out of
context that's liar face but also look
for the the chin that goes up watch this
chin goes up a little bit it's larace
Hillary
Clinton and
when Tucker
Carlson goes to talk to
flut I think you can
see that it's really he's a
puppet and now hold on hold on now now
do Adam
and Trump
obviously a puit of Putin he's peing on
all the mattresses over
there it's the same face am I right it's
the same liar face they also keep their
chin up a little
bit look for it um also Nancy Pelosi
look for Nancy P's liar face and
Trump Trump is a f and puffet again we
only have a few things we
say
Insurrection now Gavin Nome has a
version of that but he slips slips in
and out of it a little more
slickly so look for liar
face um New York Times has a story about
Tucker the mainstream
media's writing a lot of stories and
Glenn Greenwall points out he had a good
he good good story he says so hilarious
the New York Times has written four news
articles on Tucker Carlson's visit to
Russia in each one they claim he's quote
a diminished figure since leaving
Fox that's the New York Times is the uh
article that my smart Democrat friend
tells me I should read so I could get
the real news instead of all the fake
stuff I've been
watching The New York Times
is telling Their audience that Tucker
Carlson's profile and importance in the
world has
decreased as they write about him over
and over and over again because he has
the best interview that any of them have
ever gotten in the last five
years I don't even know how to even say
this in a way that doesn't make my head
explode four times they've called him a
diminished figure his profile is the
highest of any media person in the world
who isn't Joe
Rogan
his he he is the subject of all the
coverage this
week and in it the New York
Times the the head of the you know the
news you know credibility for the left
each time they claim he's a diminished
person while doing everything they can
do to prove that he's EXA actly the
opposite and not just a little bit but
aggressively one of the most important
journalists in the world right
now how how many people on the left read
this and thought yeah he must be
diminished since he left because they
don't see him on
X they believe
this now do you think that the writers
who wrote it believed
it did the editors who checked it did
they actually not know that they writing
four articles about this guy while
calling him not
important how in the world do they not
notice that in their own behavior or are
they are they completely conscious of
what they're doing it could be a little
both because at one at some point you
know you become the Nazi you know on day
one you're just you know doing the walk
and the talk and wearing the clothes but
if you do it long enough yeah you're
Nazi yeah maybe on day one you're just
going
along but uh yeah all right New York
Times uh they are I don't even know what
they are but at least you have uh you
have other Publications in a election
year that you can trust for example
there's a publication called the
hill and the hill referred to uh the
border and said uh with immigrants
Crossing at their highest levels in
decades Republicans are running on the
issue of a border in and they put it in
quotes
crisis
that's right the
hill put crisis and
quotes because it's Republicans were
running on the
issue if if Democrats were running on an
issue do you think they put the issue in
quotes as in maybe this isn't even a
real issue people I'm not even
sure that's a real
issue how about people are dying from
the fenel
crisis yeah maybe maybe uh Ukraine is
having a little a little
military crisis no how about you take
the quote marks away from the word
because we can all see what's going on I
mean this is not even bipartisan at this
point all right I think you've seen
enough examples now let me tell you
what's wrong with everything are you
ready because you you can feel it right
everything is
broken I've got it all figured out and
I'm just going to read it to you the way
I wrote it on on X if you didn't see it
yet because the order it is is important
here it is here's what's wrong with
everything it's a system problem it's a
system problem but not one system but
there's a commment part to all right I
finally figured out what's wrong with
everything it's a system problem the
introduction of trump into the systems
you know our various government and
other systems uh broke almost everything
and in multiple different ways so in
other words you could go back to the the
cause was Trump now that doesn't mean
Trump's bad that means he was the
triggering triggering
event and the fake news created um a
white supremacist
hysteria specifically because of trump
so tell me you're with me so far would
you agree that Trump was was so scary to
the system that they created a white
supremacist hysteria yeah we we watched
it now what happened with that white
supremacist hysteria well that led you
to the Fine people hoax and it also LED
you to the George Floyd hoax hoax in the
sense that you know it's obviously
wasn't
murdered um now what what did the George
Floyd hoax and the fine people hoax lead
to well it led to massive increase in D
right so massive increase in di that's
well documented every and and the number
of white people who got promoted from
that point on you know dropped to
practically nothing in Corporate America
so they they really did a full court
press on
Dei now what's the uh the the uh let's
say unavoidable consequence of pushing
Dei faster than let's say it could
organically
happen the natural outcome of that is
incompetence in all of our systems so in
other words you should expect that the
FAA would be hiring less capable Pilots
less capable air control people not
because they're black not because
they're
women see this is why you can't you
can't talk about this in public because
it'll take about two seconds for
somebody to say hey he just said black
people can't be
no nothing like that not even anything
close to that it's just math if you
don't have enough people to fill the
jobs but you got to fill the jobs anyway
and you have to reach down and lower
your your requirements you're guaranteed
to get fewer qualified people has
nothing to do with gender has nothing to
do with anything but just limitations of
math so that's a guarantee that Trump
caused a uh the news to do a white
supremacist hysteria purely for
political reasons I don't think the news
people believe this so much that created
uh several hoaxes that led to the Dei
that caused to massive
incompetence u in all of our systems
which on day one you don't really
notice but but once it works to the
system and it'ss a certain critical
point you actually have too many
incompetent people for anything to work
right have you ever been in a big
organization
and everybody was pretty good at their
job except maybe just one person and the
whole thing goes to hell it only takes
one bad person in the group and you
can't get anything done right so by now
in theory Dei should have ruined almost
everything important in the
country because it's just math and again
I'll say it every five seconds has
nothing to do with anybody being black
or minority has nothing to do with what
color you are it's just the system it's
a system that tries to do something that
the math doesn't support that's the
problem
right and then on top of
that um we've got wokeness and
cancellation what would be the antidote
to any bad
system the antidote to every bad system
is always the same Free Speech you got
to be able to say oh here's what's wrong
I'm going to talk about it with
everybody who can help fix it and then
because we're all talking about it
transparently we identify the problem
and then we correct it and go on that
can't happen today because you're not
allowed to talk about it so if you can't
talk about it you've created a permanent
system problem problem number one is the
math well problem number one is the Mass
area that's you know intentionally
created by the media the Mass area
creates the Dei the the EI has just a a
math problem has nothing to do with
gender or or race just the math of it
but they're forcing that math into the
system so it forces the quality of the
employees to go down it's guaranteed now
on top of that you have some natural
retirements so you probably have you
know qualified people leaving in just a
natural way more often than than before
so those are two forces in the system
that we didn't have before there's big
pressures and again you can't talk about
it honestly so there's no correcting
possibility you can't correct what you
can't talk
about all right on top of that the Trump
experience has made it clear that all of
our government systems are corrupt they
probably always were but as long as we
didn't notice things limped
along for my entire life Congress has
been doing omnius bills that look
corrupt to me we've always been f mil
industrial complex that looks suspicious
to me but as long as we were limping
along you know as long as the country
seemed to grow and prosper I think we
are all okay with our
suspicions right do me a favor you don't
have to say 34 every time we get the 34
Minute um glitch because it makes me
lose my
place anyway
um so so would you agree with the the
fact that because of trump we simply
notice that our systems are more corrupt
we notic that the news is fake we
noticed that our Wars might be optional
right we're noticing we're noticing even
that the science was
corrupt I didn't I didn't have any idea
how bad it was I had no idea but now I
do now we notice
so now we don't accept the science
because we know it's corrupt we don't
accept the omnius bills we know they're
corrupt we don't accept the Foreign Wars
that look sketchy we don't accept the
elections we can't fully audit we don't
trust the news for good reason we don't
trust our Intel services to not be
agents of one party and we see the
justice system as being weaponized fair
is that all fair did I say anything that
you don't obviously observe yeah and
while all that happened Soros found a
way to take control of the American
systems via funding non-government
entities and integrating them into the
American system Fair Soros find a way
found a sort of back door that he could
take control of our system without the
approval of the people that happened
that happened yep um but at the head of
the snake is the fake news and fake
science and there's no correcting
mechanism you can't correct the science
and you can't correct the news if you
can't talk about it you can't correct
the science if you get kicked out of
science for doubting the science that's
our current situation you can't correct
the fake news if that's all there
is and you can't correct uh wokeness you
can't correct Dei because wokeness will
cancel you these are system
problems and right now the the only
antidote to all of this is free speech
and the only place you can get that is
on the xplatform at the
moment and that's why the entire
government is trying to kill the
platform and maybe musk at the same time
and you watch that right in front of you
you can actually see the system
organizing self-organizing to destroy
Elon musk's businesses his reputation
and the
xplatform
so did I nail it
well what we have is a system problem
and it's very easy to see both the
sources of it and how it worked through
the system in each case and the reason
it was so hard to
spot the reason it was so hard to spot
is it wasn't one system you know you had
the the Soros influence you had the bad
news you had the intelligence people
working with the corrupt news you've got
elections that look more sketchy than
ever before but I suspect they always
were do you know here's a little uh
confession do you remember some of you
remember the election between Gore and
Bush and it was tight and the Supreme
Court had got involved and they counted
their hanging Chads and then in the end
George Bush
won I didn't think there was much
difference between the two candidates
honestly like I I was Pro Gore at the
time um then Bush won and you know what
my reaction was when my candidate that I
didn't prefer one honestly it was like
huh yeah he might be
okay literally that was it you know I
think you know Bush might do okay as as
it turned out he
didn't but in my mind they were not
really that different they didn't seem
that different right I didn't think my
life would change either way but when
you have you have Trump in the mix
people imagine that you have one regular
candidate and one you know chaos racist
candidate or whatever they're saying
about him so yeah if you had the lack of
free speech you can see why all of our
systems are broken uh and the lack of
free speech would include the scientific
Community who doesn't have it in a real
way uh the news which is literally
designed to fool you it's not designed
to inform you and there you have it so
if you were going to fix it all you
start with free
speech that's where you you start and
the the only uh bulwarks against it are
independent people like me who I do not
have to take a check from a corporate
entity so it's hard to get to me without
you know now that I'm cancelled um and
people like tuer
Carlson people like Russell Brand you
know I could name 100 others but it's
the it's the independent people who are
the your last hope is basically Your
Last Hope Obi-Wan
Kenobi all right a few more stories
China is still unsafe for business
they've got massive deflation but tell
me this deflation is obviously terrible
for China but doesn't that lower our
costs is that deflation going to work
its way into products or is it only the
domestic problem over there I don't know
how that works its way through the the
economics so I don't know if that's
anything for us well here's a story from
Brazil so the Supreme Court um is
ordered a I guess they ordered a police
massive Roundup of former uh political
Rivals so the former president
bolsonaro and uh his a lot of his top
people who are generals and whatnot are
being rounded up by the current
Administration and they have to under
their passports and basically they're
screwed so it looks like the current
Administration is weaponizing their
government and going after the losers of
the last race and their claims were
here's why they're mad they're saying
that bolso claimed that the 2022
election was fake and that the person
who won was a fraud
Lula and that there were big protests
that invaded the State Building I'm
still talking about
Brazil so they the people questioned the
election and invaded the state building
on
January
8th on
January
8th um in 2022 and the court sees this
as a coup a coup
attempt a coup attempt so apparently the
conservative
president thought the election was
rigged his supporters entered the state
building and the other side called it a
coup attempt and now they're rounding
them up and putting them in jail because
apparently they must have some sway in
their own Supreme
Court do you know what America would
look
like if Trump had not made the Supreme
Court
conservative
Brazil
Brazil the only reason Trump can stay
out of jail and his and his
supporters might
be the Supreme
Court Brazil apparently doesn't have
that
protection and now the ruling party is
locking up the people who lost the last
election which one of them is right do
you think the election was
rigged how would we
know
how would we know but I can tell you
that they don't have free
speech because if they had free speech
they could say it was rigged all day
long and you wouldn't call it a coup
attempt Brazil yeah not the United
States that's Brazil it sounded a lot
like the United States didn't it and the
only difference the only difference was
that our Supreme Court probably wouldn't
do this it wouldn't support something
like like that I
think all right there's a story that uh
the US used an air strike to kill an
Iranian commander in
Iraq and it was a precision air strike
and it just got just the car of the of
the bad guy in it and it killed them
good do you believe that
story do you believe that we surgically
took out exactly who we were looking for
and got that guy and he was the one who
uh he was behind the Drone strike that
killed three Americans so not only did
we identify him we found where he was we
found his car and we did a Precision
strike we're pretty great aren't we wow
wow look at us being all capable like
that huh do you believe this story I
don't believe this story now it could be
true it's within the realm of
possibility but a fog of news story
during a hot conflict you should never
believe what what are all the
possibilities number one it's not the
right
guy how would you ever
know how would you ever
know your government told you they got
the right guy what if they just said it
so you'll feel good oh we got him yeah
we got him oh we're all good so then if
they get this guy doesn't that take the
pressure off of Biden for doing a wider
War it does
does it would take the pressure off him
for having to attack Iran internally or
something crazy so isn't this isn't this
such a convenient
story that just when Biden's getting all
this pressure to act more forcefully
because of these three Americans he gets
this Precision strike gets exactly the
person he wanted man and we're good now
I guess we're
even here's why you shouldn't believe
this story
two reasons number one it's coming in a
fog of War context meaning anything
military is fake the first time you hear
it so just the fact that it happened and
it got reported don't believe it two
it's really right on the nose it's a
little too perfect that they found this
guy and they got him so
surgically maybe it's totally possible
but if you just believe it because it
was in the news you're not paying
attention the news is manufactured most
of the
time uh did you hear a story I told you
about uh Michaela Peterson and her
father Jordan Peterson there was word
that they were being suppressed on
YouTube because if you type their name
into a search engine YouTube didn't
autocomplete well Michela says that's
been fixed and now it does
autocomplete and she believes it was
suppression not a glitch and it's been
reversed
H did that really
happen something wrong with that story
too isn't
there did did YouTube just admit did she
did they just admit it was suppression
how do she know it was
suppression I don't know I mean it's
possible that it's exactly where she's
at I I do believe it was
suppression but I wonder if it was just
a device thing you know maybe if you use
a different device it
autocompletes because it has different
assumptions about what you're looking
for based on what you searched for
before maybe I don't know so I would say
it could be exactly what it looks
like I would say she's a a credible
person so if she has more information
than she revealed uh that might explain
it but um I do believe that they're
suppressing and I do believe YouTube is
suppressing
me
because my numbers are susic
suspiciously flat for year after year
after year I don't know that that ever
happened to anybody
organically all right uh here's ABC News
um tweeting about the uh big Supreme
Court case that's being argued right now
as I talk I believe I believe it's
happening right now about the 14th
Amendment and the question of whether I
think it was Colorado can take Trump off
the ballot on the uh belief that he led
an Insurrection which they say would
make him
constitutionally um
unavailable so how does ABC News talk
about that
well here's their exact
wording um they talk about the Supreme
Court and why it's there and then they
say
um
um they say that he's there because of
his role uh in the attack on January
6 so Trump's role in the attack on
January
6
now does that sound like news or is that
propaganda his role in the attack you
know what his role was his role was to
tell them to be
peaceful why don't they say he's being
uh charged for insurrection
for asking his supporters to be peaceful
but not forcefully trying hard enough to
stop
them would that be fair would that be
accurate that that he did tell them to
be peaceful he did say to fight like
hell in the context of peacefully
protesting but is it fair to say that
that the situation over is over quote
his role in the
attack his role in the attack if you
read that sentence you believe he
organized a physical violence against
Congress so you ABC News you
 you because this is personal when I
mean this this this makes my life more
dangerous I mean I've got the libs of
Tik Tock problem now because this puts
me in the role of somebody who says good
things about Trump who ABC news says he
had a role in the attack of the United
States you ABC News
you
you all right uh Biden is seeing more
dead people I guess he said he believed
he talked to helmet
Cole Germany's helmet Cole who's been
dead for a
while so now if you're keeping track
he's talked to uh dead Francois midrand
dead helmet Cole um I think soon he'll
be talking gold in my ear Charles deal
and this is just a guest but I think an
Frank so I I think he'll be sniffing the
hair of Van Frank any day because he's
3/4s down the tube to the toward the
light and he can see the dead people now
he's almost there he's not at the party
but he see he sees the party through the
window if you know what I mean you can
see him through the
window all right
um here's some more uh fake news
um this is from NBC news now remember
NBC News is connected with intelligence
and the
Democrats so keep in mind who it is
before I tell you what they're
reporting so they say that uh there's
this dust up of the anti- Dei people and
they mention Bill Amman who didn't
comment for the story and then uh musk
and here's what they say quote uh musk
calling the former Dallas Mavericks
owner Mark cubin a racist for supporting
diversity and inclusion in businesses H
is that what happened did musk call Mark
Cuban a racist for supporting
diversity well in a way but here's
another way they could have worded it
says the same thing here's how they C
have worded it U musk called Mark cu
racist for advocating racism against
white males and
hiring would that be
accurate because that's actually what
happened he didn't say I hate that
diversity Mark Cuban he didn't say
that has has Elon Musk ever spoken out
against
diversity no not
once has
he that has never happened in the
history history of the of humankind no
mus has never once said diversity is a
problem or something to correct or
anything in fact I've never heard
anybody say
that like not in public maybe somebody
says it
privately but to imagine I mean to put
it this way calling Mark H been a racist
for advocating racism uh no for uh
supporting diversity my God no it's not
supporting diversity is for supporting
Dei do you think the NBC doesn't know
the difference between supporting
diversity and supporting
Dei I'm sure they know the difference
fake
news all right
um and so there's some some push back uh
there's some black leaders like uh
morial Mr moral who's quoted as saying
uh so when you attack Dei you are
literally slapping Us in the face you're
literally saying that we don't deserve
an
opportunity
literally slapping him in the face
literally you know what he could
use could use a a little vocabulary work
because that's that's sort of uh
literally the opposite of the what the
word literally
means yeah
he meant to say figuratively not
literally twice all right
um and V ramaswami warns us again that
uh that Nikki Hy isn't even on the
battle on the ballot she wasn't on the
ballot for the uh Nevada GOP caucus so
something weird happened in Nevada I
guess the state said it had to be a
primary but the uh Republicans said we
don't want a primary we want a caucus so
they did both but the primary doesn't
count so dumb the primary doesn't count
because there's a
caucus so the caucus counts so I believe
see if I got this right I think Nikki
hilly ran in the primary because Trump
wasn't in it and it didn't count anyway
so there's no delegates at stake so she
claim she wanted to claim that she won
the Primary but I believe she got beat
by none of the above is that true did
she get beaten by none of the
above that's true
right so not only is Nevada so messed up
that they have a caucus and a primary
they run one person in it and she loses
to nobody literally to nobody or any
anybody else basically and and then
there's a caucus which is also complete
 now does it look to you like
Nevada is operating as capably as they
once
did
no no does it look like there's some
kind of massive incompetence problem
happening in
Nevada
yes I don't know if it's because of Dei
but it certainly is massively
incompetent there's no question about
that and uh V is uh pointing out that
the fact that she still has lots of
funding to to be beaten by anybody else
in a nonevent and she has lots of
funding does that look like a normal
system or it's obvious corruption right
I mean it's obvious corruption you
everything's broken at this point all
right ladies and
gentlemen that brings me to the
conclusion of my amazing plan to
comments
and um
yeah she's looking forward to Super
Tuesday it'll all be different on super
Tuesday um do you like my how did you
like my
hypothesis that it's a uh multiple
system collapse problem and that the the
head of it all is Trump is the trigger
but it's the lack of free speech that
doesn't allow you to fix it and the
wokeness so the wokeness becomes the
problem wokeness plus Trump plus masses
areia breaks all systems that's the
better way to say it right
yeah so uh it's hard to fix because
these are all different systems and Free
Speech doesn't seem to be an option at
the moment Trump emerged because it was
all failing that's true I would say that
Trump emerged because it was failing but
it's failing much harder because they
broke everything to try to address him
yeah free speech is the CER you know who
else knows that V that that's actually
V's message the free speech is the cure
I'd like to see Trump do a little bit
more of that as well little bit more
free
speech yep you know here's here's one of
the under the underappreciated thing
about my comments that got me
cancelled I don't know if I've ever said
this directly but I will if you're
trying to uh affect a change in the
world you know it's going to be you know
changing a lot of different people so
other people will have to act
differently or will be affected
differently if you get the big change
you want in the world isn't the most
important part of that besides money and
capability I guess how it will affect
other
people if you were going to do any big
change in
America isn't the most important thing
after is it practical how people will
respond to
it now the problem was that people
didn't understand how I would
respond or other ordinary you know white
guys how would they respond to a world
in which um they were that some portion
of the population was trained formally
with the government's approval to see me
as their abuser their the person who's
the problem and to see them as a victim
and to tell them that they need to do
something to fix that
situation which is all bad for me now if
you're if you're a black American and
you're saying to yourself I'd like to do
this Dei stuff and I think ESG is good
how would you ignore the impact it would
have on your fellow
citizens when it's it's got to be right
at the top of things you shouldn't
matter so if you think that black black
Americans were not
benefited by my free speech that got me
canceled you're wrong you're wrong every
single black person who heard me say
that heard free speech and they heard
somebody say this affects me this way
and that's part of your variables if you
want to make your life better whoever
you are you know I'm not just talking
about black people but whoever you are
if you want to make your life better and
has some impact whatever it is you want
has some impact on other people you need
to know what they
say I need to know what you know
everybody says about me uh sometimes
people mock me for uh Googling my own
name you're idiots you're idiots my
entire job is doing things that
influence other people in an
entertainment or information way and
then I need to know how I did it did I
influence you in a positive way negative
way did you get the wrong impression the
right impression do you hate me for it
do you love me for it I need to know
that so I go actively and I go get your
feedback because sometimes you don't say
things to me sometimes you say things
about me in other places and then I go
look for those things because there's
nothing more important than me knowing
if I do this what will be the impact and
the impact on other people's minds are
the main thing I need to know it's the
main thing so you're mad at me because I
offended you
and I did obviously I was being
intentionally offensive to be
provocative to uh draw attention to a
point I think is important but if the
only thing you saw was how bad you felt
about it you missed the
benefit the benefit is you saw how a lot
of people
feel you didn't just see my opinion you
saw how a lot of people who were in my
same situation would feel that's
useful that's
useful it's not just a little bit useful
it's really really critically useful you
need to know that this is creating a
situation where I'm literally looking to
leave the country how is that not
important right how's the country going
to be if all the white guys
leave because we're heading in that
direction that is that is the direction
we're heading that all the capable white
guys would just
leave and Asian Americans too probably
for the same reason yeah their their
opportunities are being
suppressed
so uh there's some free speech for you
now I do feel like I have more free
speech than I've ever had would you
agree uh I have clawed back my own free
speech at tremendous expense why would I
why would I put myself at so much risk
to assert my free speech
because it's the only thing that's going
to save us you not me specifically but
people like me who are willing to push
through and take the arrows your Tucker
Carlson's your Elon musk's you know
there's a longer list
but if if we don't take the punches
there's no way you're going to do it you
know because we we're just in a
privileged position so we can we we get
the benefits of the privilege but is
also a Spider-Man problem you know the
Spider-Man
problem it's a curse really with with
great power comes great
responsibility I mean part of the reason
that and Elon Musk you know risks his
entire
business and
everything I mean basically Elon Musk is
risking
interplanetary human life for free
speech because there all of it his
businesses are in Jeopardy if he keeps
talking and you know I I put my entire
reputation and life and career on the
line I'm not the only one not you know
the libs of Tik Tock Libs of Tik Tock
she puts her you know CH she puts her
life on the line her life she's risking
her
life just so you have free speech
basically showing you public
information yeah don't think that don't
think she's not risking her life she is
you right especially a woman it's a
little more
dangerous so um there is there is a way
out but uh the people who are believing
Hillary with her liar face are pretty
deeply in the Trump derangement um
Bubble but it might help you to know
what the problem is so it's a system
problem Trump triggered it
the media created what you know the
hysteria the hysteria made it you know
basically Juiced Dei which brought
massive incompetence then the media
covered it up and got rid of our free
speech so that there's no correcting
Force to our systems anymore and then
there's outside forces with money that
we didn't have before so there you have
it if anybody can fix that good luck
maybe a v
can name some else who could fix
that it's like his name just immediately
comes to mind yeah like you can't even
imagine anybody else would have a
chance but he could I think he could all
right that's all for now thanks for
listening on the YouTube in X and Rumble
platforms uh hope you had a good time
we'll see you tomorrow same place same
time let's find out what's up on that
Supreme
Court
