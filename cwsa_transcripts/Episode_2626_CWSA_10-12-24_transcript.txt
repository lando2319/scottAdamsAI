well it's Saturday and it's time for
some
fun oh there will be
fun all over the
place just getting some
comments visible here and there we
go good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty confident that you've never had a
better time but if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
can even understand with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need for that
is a cup or mug or glass a tanker chal
or Stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dop Amin
here of the day the thing that makes
everything better today with extra
oxytocin and it happens
now oh so
good
delightful well here are a few things
that I've heard on social media in the
last few
days uh the United States has some
big uh facility at the South Pole where
we're controlling earthquakes and the
weather I'm not going to say that I'm
buying into that one
yet stop it
kamla I don't know how that happens
but video just started running on its
own go away there we
go um so I don't believe this South Pole
has a major earthquake making weather
changing facility but maybe maybe that's
where they're keeping all the
UFOs I've heard there's something called
Zero Point Energy that we got from the
UFOs or the uaps so we have infinite
energy and the question is do you steal
it or give it away and I thought that's
kind of an interesting question isn't it
suppose the United States or any one
country
uh captured a downed UFO and and reverse
engineered its energy making properties
and then suppose that one country on
Earth had the the capability of having
free unlimited
energy what do you do with it well
here's the weird thing if you think
about well we'll give it to the world
and then the world will have free
energy I'm not sure we would do that I'm
not even sure we would ever make it
available so I love the fact that I
don't well I don't think that we've
discovered any infinite energy from UFOs
I'm not on that
page it is true that if we did we
wouldn't necessarily ever release it
because what it would do is it would
equalize the power of all the countries
in the world because suddenly the
smallest country in the world would have
unlimited
energy if you had unlimited energy you
could end up you know building I don't
know particle beam weapons and lasers
and you wouldn't be able to you wouldn't
be able to dominate the world as America
likes to do so sure enough if we had
infinite energy and it was free energy I
don't know if we would tell anybody we
might just keep it to
ourselves
um there are other accounts that the
aliens have have now been well
discovered and a whistleblower can
guarantee that there's a big government
facility looking all the alien ships and
let's call them uaps because we don't
know if they're in from out of
space and that there might be some
announcement soon I do not believe any
of that I do not believe there will be
an
announcement of any official sightings
of
uaps uh I do not believe that there are
orbs so the reporting is that the UFOs
are orbs you know they're like uh just
round own glowing things that seem to
defy physics I don't think so but I
could be I could be
convinced so every so all these things
that I've been hearing on social media I
don't believe a single one of them but I
could I could be convinced you know I I
could imagine some future situation in
which there's better information and
suddenly I think hey those alien orbs
are all over the place but not yet
so remember I told you how impressed I
was that Elan musk sent his Tesla robots
the Optimus uh to mingle with the crowd
at his launch event and that the robots
would just have conversations and mingle
and act like
people and then today I saw a video that
suggests now we do know that at least
the the bartender robots had some human
assist so there were some humans
operating them remotely
so that they could do maybe a little
more than a robot could do but I think
uh the reality is that maybe all the
robots might have had a little remote
exist so I don't think that that event
showed you what the robots can do I
think it's showing you what they think
they can get the robots to do eventually
I don't know that for sure but I would
be a little
cautious that the robots are as advanced
as the initial press suggested
in my experience using AI as just a
consumer it did not seem to me that the
AI itself would be anywhere near good
enough for a robot to act the way the
robots were supposed to be acting so it
wouldn't surprise me if there was a
little more human remote assistance in
those robots than was immediately
apparent I so I saw one video of a robot
having a conversation at the event and
there was clearly just a person the
there's no doubt about the voice coming
out of the robot in that clip was a
person not a not an AI but that the clip
itself could have been fake so I don't
know what's going on so I don't know if
the clip was fake or the robots were
human
assisted but I wouldn't believe that
they can do all the things that you
thought they could believe they could do
not yet I think they
will speaking of Elon Musk uh Starship
five it's going to take off in two days
so that's that really big fat rocket
that I don't think has successfully
launched um yet um but if it does it's a
big big deal it's a Starship and what's
fun about it is that when this one lands
if everything worked uh there are these
two gigantic
Chopsticks that will that will hold it
when it lands so it's going to come down
like a regular rocket but apparently it
won't be completely stable
uh when it lands so these giant
Chopsticks are just going to grab it
when it reaches the ground do you think
that's going to work I'll tell you if
you told me that Rockets were going to
you know take off and then land and so
they could be reused I might have said I
don't know if he could ever do that and
then I hear that you're going to grab
the rocket with giant
Chopsticks and then I say again I'm not
sure you could do that I don't know if
that can be done
we'll find out in two days we might find
out if it can be done I wouldn't bet
against musk when it comes to Giant
mechanical
things well Babylon B has a parody movie
called January 6th the most deadliest
day the most deadliest day because
Democrats say January 6 was the most
deadliest day which is you know
laughably
incorrect so I only saw the trailer for
it but it looks like it's very
funny uh CBS News was acting
ridiculously at a headline today that uh
Trump wants to make auto loan interest
tax uh interest on auto loans tax
deductible now that part's true Trump
did say I'll make uh I'll make the
interest on auto loans tax
deductible um and then CBS news says it
would mostly help the rich experts
say it would mostly help the
rich to make
a write off on your car loan well this
is
awkward but as an official
representative of people who are often
called Rich we um we don't get car
loans did anybody know that we um it
comes with being rich
they just sort of pay cash for the car I
mean I don't know what kind of car you
you would be rich and still need a loan
for that's sort of like not being rich
now to be fair the car I'm driving I did
have a loan on yeah the the BMW SUV that
I have it just happened to be some weird
period in my life where I had this you
know a lot of cash output at the same
time but I wanted a car and I didn't
want to wait a week and I didn't want to
sell stock because I like the stock I
had so I did get a
loan believe it or not now because I'm
rich as soon as my cash replenished I
paid it off so I you know I didn't pay
it until completion it was just sort of
a short-term cash flow management thing
very normal that had nothing to do with
being rich or poor or anything else it
was just a weird coincidence of events
that I needed cash at the same time for
a bunch of things um but generally
speaking
it would be true that rich people pay
cash for
cars so CBS you're being
silly there's a report in the New
England Journal of Medicine John
fleetwood's writing that uh big
Pharma apparently paid over a billion
dollars to influence medical research be
between 2020 and
2022 which would be the period of the
pandemic um but they they tried to
influence the medical research in bmj
jamama and valan those are the big ones
it said 59% of Journal
reviewers so these would be the people
reviewing the studies to say that
they're passing peer review or not that
uh 59% of them uh received fora
payments revealing massive conflicts of
interest
so you trust that science
knowing that 59% of the people reviewing
the science are being paid by people who
would kind of like that science to go
their
way yeah so you should not be surprised
that science is in the state of total
lack of
credibility when there's a good reason
for that apparently science is pretty
much bribed and ruined like everything
else but
um uh one so you've heard that uh
there's a big argument about voter ID
Democrats say we don't need no voter ID
it's just causing people to not be able
to vote and Republicans are saying if
you don't have V voter ID then all the
people who are not allowed to vote are
going to vote and the election will be
different well there is one study from
2019 19 that allegedly found that strict
ID requirements have no effect on
fraud that if you have strict ID
requirements you get basically the same
result as if you don't have any
requirements at all on
fraud does that sound even slightly true
to
you I don't know that looks like the
sort of study that may have gone through
the 59% of Journal reviewers who were
who are tainted by the Pharma industry
payments in this case has nothing to do
with PHA but
uh kind of wonder who reviewed this
study don't you who reviewed that
study I'm going to say that uh it might
not matter if you have strict ID
requirements if the environment is that
people are not talking about ID
requirements if nobody is talking about
ID requir requirements I completely
understand why it wouldn't be much of an
issue because people who didn't have ID
would think that they needed it so
they'd stay home and that would be the
end of the
story everybody would just assume they
needed ID if they were going to vote so
if they didn't have it they just stay
home and they'd never bring it up and
nobody would even think there was any
difference but what if there's a
gigantic National conversation about
voter ID combined with a massive influx
of people who don't have ID because
they're coming from other countries do
you think you can use your 2019 study
that's probably in the first
place to find out what will happen in a
completely different
situation science I'm glad we've got
this science to tell us what's
true so I'm not going to believe that
one the propaganda Network sometimes
called MSNBC I I can't call it a News
Network anymore it's just so
ridiculously over-the-top propaganda at
this point that to imagine it's a it's
like a news platform it's not it's just
so far from news it's not even close but
uh uh Chris Ayes is telling us that
Trump is signaling he's not going to
accept a defeat in
2020 here's how I interpret that if the
propaganda Network tells you Trump is
signaling he won't accept the election
results What I Hear uh what I hear is a
secret dog whistle from
MSNBC telling us that they're going to
definitely rig the election and they
want to Prime you in advance that
anybody who would question this upcoming
election is some kind of a crazy fascist
nazi
possibly
yeah I'm hearing the dog whistle the dog
whistle says we're totally going to
cheat so we we want to make sure in
advance that if anybody is going to
question the election that we'll
discredit them before they even try I
mean I mean people who's going to who's
going to question an election in the
United States except bad people only bad
people are going to question an election
unless it's the Democrats in which case
they've got a really good
argument but when the Republicans do it
bad people just bad
people yeah anyway that's not a good
look uh Barack Obama is still getting
some backlash for telling black men that
maybe they're just a little too worried
about having a woman president and
therefore are not supporting uh Comm
Harris as much as maybe they
should and um I'm I'm not too interested
in it I I'm sort of interested that
there's a backlash from both the left
and the right uh to it the right just
sort of makes fun of it but the left
I've seen a number of people saying wh
why is why is Barack Obama insulting my
people why is he
insulting uh black
men have you noticed that when people
don't do what Democrats
want they don't tell that it's not so
much the reasons why they should do
something different it's like you suck
every everybody's a racist or a fascist
they don't do exactly what a Democrat
wants them to do how about sometimes
you'd make an argument no you're just
you're just a bunch of sexists according
to Barack
Obama so but here's uh something I
wondered if if it's
sexist and it could be by the way I I
have heard some uh black men on social
media say that they wouldn't vote for a
woman as a
leader however the people who say that
that I saw on social media gives that
strong indication that they weren't
going to vote
anyway they they didn't exactly look
like regular voters the one who said
they wouldn't vote for a woman uh but I
wondered would they have voted for
Hillary Clinton because we would know
that right because she
ran well Clinton got 88% of the black
vote in
2016 how do you get 88% of the black
vote on unless black men are massively
voting for you am I
wrong I mean Le let's say you even got I
don't know 98% of of the women voting
for you the black women you'd still have
a whole bunch of black men voting to get
up to 88% of black voters are for
Hillary so I don't know how much it
showed up when Clinton was running
because as I've often said um you can
come up with you know plenty of
criticisms for Hillary Clinton but among
the criticisms would not be included the
following she's stupid nope nope say
what you will about Hillary Clinton and
I say plenty she's not stupid she's very
very
smart um so if you're a black man and
you see that she's been a senator she's
been the state department person she's
been in the White House do you think
that black men would look at Hillary
Clinton and say oh there's someone who
could never be uh
commander-in-chief I I deeply hate
Hillary Clinton but she absolutely could
have been a
commander-in-chief and I'm not going to
say that about everybody because I don't
think it's true for comml Harris but I
think it depends who the woman is I
think that this whole idea that um
misogyny is involved but just with KLA
harrris I think that has more to do with
her although I wouldn't be surprised if
the way people interpret it in their own
minds is I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with a woman as a
leader I think they were pretty
comfortable when Hillary Clinton was
running even I would be I mean even I
would be comfortable with her in charge
you know if I trusted at least her
Mission she has she has at least the
capability full capability
all right but here's the thing that uh
sticks out for me I haven't heard
anybody talk about it how did it
suddenly become socially acceptable and
socially safe for both black men and
black women to say in public and on
video and on social media that they have
a complete support for
Trump this is
new right now I'm not saying that there
were not any blacks supporters of trump
before because of course they were but I
don't feel like like they felt safe
saying it out loud in public like oh
yeah yeah yeah I'm totally I'm Trump all
day long and I've seen video after video
of young people older people a whole
bunch of different ages but uh black
voters usually on the street sometimes
in small groups and they're just saying
oh yeah Trump Trump trump all day now
they're not all saying Trump there are
others are voting for Harris Etc but
this is completely different and here's
my
speculation I don't believe that you
would see so many people so many black
American voters supporting Trump vocally
and in public and with no no sense of
embarrassment about it you no sense of
oh I hate to tell you this but just
saying it it's not like I have to hedge
it I have to say well he he's he's bad
in these ways but all over you know if
you if you weigh everything I think I I
slightly support him you know that's
what white people say that's how white
people talk you know all this Nuance
well you know don't like everything
about him but you better any alternative
and you see the Black American voters
are just oh yeah Trump all day long it's
not even
close so here's what I
think I think you couldn't possibly see
so many black American voters
be completely comfortable to give a non-
nuanced full-throated
yes Trump in public unless
unless the private conversations look
the
same and maybe more because I don't know
what percentage of black Americans
privately saying Trump might be the
answer is sufficient for anybody to say
oh I could just say that in public now
and I couldn't say it in public before
but I can do it
now something big has changed and I
think it's not just the public
statements I think that you know I think
that at home the conversation's
completely
different um Glenn yunin points out it's
only uh you know 30 days till the
election and I get I guess the Biden
Harris Department of Justice they're
filing a lawsuit against
Virginia the Commonwealth for for
enforcing a law to remove noncitizens
from the voting rules so Virginia
followed its own law it's a law that
says they have to do it and they cleaned
up their voting uh roles so that it's
only people who should be allowed to
vote are on the list of people who
should be allowed to
vote now what's the problem with that
what would be the problem of improving
your list of Voters so that it doesn't
include people who shouldn't
vote well according to the Biden Harris
Department of Justice uh they're getting
sued for doing
that and here's the question I would ask
since the argument against it has
something to do with disenfranchising
voters can you show me that
person can you just find one that one
would be fine fine you know normally I
would ask for uh a scientific poll to
make sure that there's really a problem
here that needs to be addressed the
problem being that if you get rid of all
the voters who are dead and not in the
state and should not be voting that it
would somehow suppress the votes of
people who are completely allowed to
vote so somehow preventing people who
are not allowed to vote from voting
would have some kind of of a some kind
of an impact on people who are allowed
to
vote so can we get an interview with
that person who would not vote because
Virginia cleaned up his voting roles
just one again I I don't need a gold
standard controlled trial just show me
just show me that one just one voter who
said I was totally to vote until
Virginia cleaned up its voting roles and
now I don't know what to do can I vote I
mean I'm totally a legal voter and I've
always been a legal voter and I live in
the state and I'm an American citizen
and I've got ID but now that Virginia
got rid of the people who are not legal
voters I I don't know if I can vote
anymore let's have a talk with that guy
because that guy sounds kind of fun I I
think I'd like to see that crazy old
bastard explain exactly why he can't
vote this time because the people who
have nothing to do with him can't
vote just one just one just one
interview and I I'll be on your side
Democrats you can win me over with just
one one data point that's all I'm asking
for just
one
anyway um
we're going to play a game that I call
drunk or stupid I'm going to play a
video of KL Harris at a recent event and
I'd like you to
judge drunk or
stupid one moment
please oh it's not working
let me see if I can make it
work can you hear that my technology is
failing
me drunk or stupid
[Music]
all right well you'd have to see it and
uh I did test this I'm in the rumble
Studio oh you got no sound not on locals
h
darn it all right sorry about that but
um the the the technology does do this
and I did test it before we went live
but it just stopped working in the
middle so that's not
cool that's not cool anyway so if you'd
seen it boy would we be having a good
time now we're not now I'm just all
pissed off but if I were not pissed off
and you had seen that my goodness we'd
be having a good time now instead of
this whiny up attitude that I
have because this thing didn't
work when I wanted it
to but boy would we be having fun if it
did no she's at um I'll just giving you
my opinion in my opinion she's obviously
drunk and and it's just funny that we're
pretending like we don't see it
I you can see you can see it on my X
feed if you want to see
it anyway while she was acting stupid
and drunk in public uh Tim wals was
talking to Michael
stran and if you want to see a car wreck
of an interview you should see that now
it turns out that every single day now
now that both walace and Harris are
doing more public stuff it really is
just the news about them complet
completely
blowing so to speak some public
event and I've never seen an easier
campaign where the other side just has
to show the actual event with no
commentary and just have Donald Trump I
I approve this message he's actually
doing that now and it's freaking amazing
he he literally just ran a campaign
where it was nothing but her exact words
he added no commentary whatsoever and
then at the end he just said I approve
this
message that's baller if you could just
show them in their own words and not add
a single thing and just say here's my
campaign add look what look at this
that's great yeah so the Tim walsing was
a total train wreck as
well one of the questions was I guess he
had at one point said he wanted to get
rid of the electoral college but the
campaign is not on that so stran asked
him well you said you wanted to get rid
of the electoral college but what do you
say now because K Harris does not want
to and he did the well you know I said a
thing but uh the campaign is very clear
very clear uh we're not going to do
that
okay all right so JD Vance was being
grilled by a New York Times Reporter and
the New York Times Reporter was trying
desperately to get him on video to say
that wouldn't accept uh the results of
the next election because that would
make sure that you knew that maybe they
had didn't accept the last one and and
maybe that's just who they are and maybe
that's just proof that Trump is a
fascist
so uh she tries with the question asking
Vance you know did Trump lose the 2020
election and Vance went into a story
about how uh the uh FBI convinced the
technology platforms to lie about the
hunter laptop and that there is science
that supports the fact that it changed
the outcome of the vote in a in a pretty
measurable
way and then of course she didn't like
that because that was something that
sort of anoited the vote counting world
so she wanted to limit it to the you
know is the vote rigged or not and then
once again JD used her question as an
excuse to talk about not why she she
wanted to talk about which is vote
counting rigging but talking about
rigging in a larger sense because the
social media platforms and our
Information Network were clearly rigged
in a way intended to change the election
and it was done by people within the
government and then she didn't like that
so she tried to ask him a third time and
then JD for a third time used the time
to describe how the election had been
totally rigged outside of the vote
counting part totally rigged by the
information you know bad behavior for by
our government then she tried for the
fourth time to get him to say something
about the upcoming
elections and they asked if if he'd
commit to a peaceful transfer of power
now JD Vance being one of the more
gifted um
communicators did the following which I
if you want to see perfect form this is
it so the question is would he commit to
a peaceful transfer of power what's the
first thing you say when asked would you
commit to a peaceful transfer of power
what's the first thing to say every
time yes okay if you don't say yes to
that question and you start explaining
or giving some background or well you
need to know the context oh you
up
[Laughter]
that the question is you know will you
accept a you know will you do a peaceful
transfer you say yes to that you you
give that a hard yes and then you talk
about it you don't talk about it first
and then get to something like a yes no
no no you say yes hard yes unambiguous
yes and then you talk about
stuff for example
um he said uh uh of course it will be
peaceful and then he said because he
expects Trump to win perfect
perfect and uh but of course you know he
wasn't saying it would only be peaceful
if Trump wins he was just you know
projecting that he thinks he W but then
he said and I quote but if there are
problems of course in the same way
Democrats protested in 2004
and Trump raised in 2020 we we will make
sure every ballot is counted there we go
there we
go if there are
problems he he almost got there th this
is very close to a perfect answer but
it's short so I'm going to I'm going to
criticize it at the same time I'm going
to say it's the best I've
seen nobody's been closer to getting
this perfect
he got really
close but that last 10% that he fell
short on this answer is the 10% between
a landslide Victory and making no
difference at all it's just so close and
here here's the difference between
Landslide
Victory and making no difference at
all he should have gone on
offense so he was completely on defense
and boy did he do a good job on defense
boy if if you were going to say did he
defend himself well yeah yeah great good
good
defense
except the Democrats when they ask the
questions this way are exposing their
soft
underbelly meaning that they're
providing a kill shot if you wanted to
go on offense he came close to offense
he came close when he when he took it at
the domain of counting the votes and
it's the domain of the the information
manipulation by the Press but it's going
to feel to the public like a little bit
of a weasly avoidance of the question
because he he wanted to avoid the vote
counting issue and go to another issue
that he could make hay with good
defense good
defense here's what offense looks
like Mr Vance
uh are you willing to accept the uh the
outcome of the election and have a
peaceful
transfer um before I answer uh I think
for the benefit of the audience we'll
need some
clarification what are you talking about
well are you talking about an election
that looks to all observers like it
looks
clean well I'm asking you will you
accept the election I know but one could
imagine there could be an election where
even objective observers think oh that's
very non-standard
so I'm I'm asking you just so I answer
your cor your question correctly are you
saying if the election looks like
something's deeply wrong with it will I
accept it is that your
question well no no uh if it's like if
it's like 2020 oh well you know
2020 was very different from a lot of
projections and there were a lot of bell
weather states that didn't go in the
direction anybody had ever seen
before is that the is that what you're
talking about are you saying that if the
next election also violates a lot of
expectations and Bell weathers and looks
very non-standard compared to what we
would expect is that the situation
you're asking
about it's a Kill Shot you can make the
questioner just
melt you you you're you're making you're
trying to make me think past the sale
the sale that you're trying to make is
that the election looks perfect on in
every way if the election looks perfect
in every way I can commit 100% we're
going to accept it there will be a
peaceful transfer of power and the
people will have spoken is that what
you're talking about one that doesn't
have any problems and there are no
questions when you look at it and even
the Republicans and and even the most
the most Ardent Democrats could look at
it and say yeah that looks fair I don't
see any problems with
that somebody just lost the the did you
really lose the
sound I can't tell if I'm being
pranked hey Paul are you still
there I need a uh I need a sound check
Paul I have to ask somebody I can trust
on the uh the
networks I'm getting pranked in the
comments all right there's no problem
with the sound right all right good
um so that's the thing if uh if anybody
asks Vance or Trump that question or any
of their pundits the person before
answering you have to
say I need a clarification on your
question do you mean if it looks like
it's fraudulent or do you mean if it
looks
perfect it's a kill shot it's the end of
that question and it's their biggest
it's their biggest issue that he won't
you you know he'll stay in office but
nobody would be able to get past that
question it's a Kill Shot there there
aren't very many kill shots that are
this clean this is a clean kill shot and
it and it keeps being presented over and
over again and nobody takes the shot and
I'm not exactly sure what's going on
there but take the shot take the shot
next time JD I think you could end this
thing anyway um have you seen the ads of
men for Harris The Men Who say they're
supporting Harris there's a new campaign
ad from that group and uh so it it
purports to show Tim Walls and a number
of manly
Pursuits you know he's using tools he's
driving cars he's he owns guns he's got
a dog he's a man's man but I have to say
that uh if I can advise one thing for
the Harris
campaign you should really hire at least
one heterosexual man and you would not
embarrass yourself this much because if
you saw the commercial it is the gayest
looking thing you've ever seen in your
life while trying to to teach us how
manly he is and you know this is not a
criticism against anybody gay I'm just
saying if I were doing a commercial
about had to be a gay man I would hire a
gay
man if I wouldn't hire a
lesbian I would if the commercial is
let's show this guy as a heterosexual
man I would have heterosexual men
working on it and nobody
else because they know far better what
it's like to be a heterosexual man again
if it were for black voters I'd make
sure that the commercial was mostly
managed by black voters because they
would know black voters are feeling and
thinking better than other people would
so Harris campaign needs to find at
least one heterosexual man maybe a token
you know you don't have to give him a
lot of power but at least put him in the
room to say um that uh that looks super
gay just you know so they know it before
they put it out so that's my advice they
need a heterosexual man to do some
serious man's
explaining it's just one of the one of
the times mansplaining is exactly what
you
need um did you know that uh the the ad
probably the first ad you saw for Camel
KL Harris ad that was men forla was
written by one of Jimmy Kimmel's writers
Jacob
Reed and
uh uh apparently none of the men who
were used in that ad of men for Kamala
were actual regular people they were
paid
actors so the men for kamla weren't even
the men for kamla I mean they might also
be for her but they were paid
actors I I guess they couldn't get any
like real normal men that look good on
camera who would just say that they were
for KL Harris I'm pretty sure there are
tens of millions of them but they
couldn't find anybody they were happy
with so they got actors
well Harris has released her uh health
records I think Trump has not for this
cycle um but what I wonder is did they
test her for
drugs and why
not if I'm going to see a presidential
candidate's um health records and it
doesn't have a drug
test I don't really think I've seen the
records because if somebody is acting so
drunk or inebriated on something that it
becomes a major campaign question and
you don't reveal any you know drug tests
that would indicate a drug problem or
any other drug use um I'm going to say
that's not actually a health record or
even close that would be a partial that
would be a partial health record
intentionally keeping out important
elements now if it were Trump I probably
wouldn't even ask for that because you
know he's so famously a non-drinker and
he never looks like he's on any kind of
drug so I think we need to know she
needs a drug test and I don't mean that
purely
politically I I've seen how she
acts and I don't want that person in
charge of the nuclear
football so you need to you need to tell
me is that real is the way you're acting
in that video
real or are you
drunk cuz if it's drunk I don't want you
near the nuclear
button I mean really seriously that's
important so
anyway
um I heard today in the comments to uh
post about Tim Walls a set of
accusations that were very
specific and very terrible
they are sufficiently
terrible uh it's an accusation of a past
Behavior Uh during his football coaching
years now it is so bad that I'm not
going to repeat it okay and it's not
from it's not from
a credible Source meaning some platform
that I would believe it's from an
individual but the the thing that
bothered me about it is it was really
detailed it was really
detailed
so maybe there's something to come out
um I'm definitely not going to tell you
what I read because of the
source but if it's
true wow thanks
Paul if it's
true well the polling information is all
over the place uh the uh
538 forecast says Harris remains ahead
in Pennsylvania Nevada Wisconsin and
Michigan which would give her enough to
win 538 have you heard of them
538 so that used to be uh Nate
Silvers uh entity but he sold that and
he's out of that now I think it's just
the New York Times owns it there's a New
York Times own 538 I'm not sure who owns
it but uh this is a different result
than I'm seeing in other
news um in other news real clear
politics is flipping Nevada for Trump
which I think would give him all of the
Swing States because I've been hearing
the last 24 hours oh it looks like
Trump's going to win all the swing
States or could with the exception of
Nevada and then today's news is oh he's
going to win
Nevada now keep in mind that I don't
believe anything about the polls at the
moment they're just all over the place
and they're crazy and they disagree with
each other but the so on one hand 538
says Harris is ahead in the swing States
uh on the other hand Real Clear Politics
says that he's she's so far behind she's
even going to lose
Nevada um in other news um the
apparently the number of mail in votes
is way way down in in the swing States
and that presumably would help Trump we
don't know
so it does seem and and then there's
another thought that uh I think M was it
Mark Halper and who was saying this that
the the internal polls are worse than
the public ones and the reason is that
the internal ones are maybe the
expensive and good
ones
so we'll see Rasmus in is signaling that
Trump's you know got a got a solid
situation here and then uh if you looked
at the the results against Trump the
funny thing about having Trump run for
election three times in a row is that
you have a baseline to compare things to
that's really interesting and Harris is
doing way
worse um compared to either
Biden who won uh and also Al to Hillary
who
lost so Kam is way under the numbers
that even Clinton had when she lost
although lost very
narrowly so um what's confusing is they
Harris in the polls anyway seems to be
maybe one point ahead or effectively
within the margin of error on a whole
bunch of States depending on which poll
you're looking at and most of the SM of
people would say that if he's tied in
the
polling or within one it's actually a
win because he he always performs better
than the polls but the others don't so
if that's true that this time he's also
going to perform better than the polls
and I'm I'm speculating that this will
be the biggest difference between the
polls and the actual vote so this is my
prediction so this will be the third
Trump run and each time they say what
they think the Trump vote will be and
each time it's bigger two out of three
so far if this one is I think this one
also be bigger but I'm going to predict
it's the
biggest of the
differences that there are more people
who are intentionally just pranking the
pollsters than at any time in the past
and that they know it's part of the they
know it's part of winning because
they're they're trying to use a prank
basically to defeat what they think will
be cheaters so if they prank hard enough
the cheaters won't know how hard they
have to cheat and they may under cheat
which the belief is that that's what
happened in 2016 I don't have any
evidence of that I think Jim Kramer uh
came out and said that Harris is going
to
win Jim Kramer is sort of famous as a
counter
indicator so you can interpret that any
way you
want uh
uh axios is trying to soften the fact
that people are learning that Democrats
challenge elections too so axio says
that when the Democrats challenge
elections it's largely
symbolic not like those serious
challenges coming from the Republicans
so when they do it it's just talk it's
largely symbolic for example in uh
2017 or in 20 let's say 2005
Democrats objected to Bush's win in Ohio
but you know they just sort of went
through the process and worked it out
and yeah they largely
symbolic now is it symbolic if you have
to recount the hanging
Chads symbolic is when you don't do
anything in the real world they have to
recount a recount is not
symbolic that would be the opposite the
recount is an actual set of actions that
happened in the real world that's not
symbolic that was actually trying to
find out who won how about 2017 with
half a dozen Democrats filed
objections uh to Trump's elector slates
but they didn't get a backing of any
Senators so they couldn't Force any
votes so largely symbolic no it's not
that was a full-on attempt that just
didn't work there was nothing symbolic
about it it just didn't work
Jamie Rasin of course he he would be the
figurehead of democrat lying he said
quote Democrats don't engage in election
fraud and election
fabrication now he's also one of those
backwards indicators that whatever he
says they don't do oh they're definitely
doing
that so if he ever tells you they're
definitely not sacrificing children in
Satanic
rituals they're definitely sacrificing
children in Satanic rituals by the way I
don't believe that but I also don't rule
it
out I think it's highly unlikely that
there's a massive National satanic
Network that the Democrats are all
plugged into and Diddy and Epstein and
all that I don't think
so but we do live in a world where if
you said would you give it 5% I'd say
yeah yeah I'll give it 5% Poss
possibility anyway there's
a um there's a uh had piece in
slate slate is a
publication uh and uh written by Ben uh
meth
Lily and uh he's talking about how
people like me say that when Trump says
something that's not true his hyperbole
as I call it that uh and they they
quoted me in the article quote Trump's
hyperbole is directionally accurate and
benign and here's how they described me
they said Scott Adams the Dilbert
Creator turned right-wing thought
leader am I a right-wing thought
leader I don't know not bad but they
didn't hit me hard they just noted that
uh um I I've got this framing that it's
directionally correct even if it's
hyperbolic and
uh then they tried to fact check Trump
that that at an October 5th rally he
told a uh story about a uh woman's
weightlifting record that was broken by
somebody who was born a man and had
never lifted before and so they fact
checked it and found out that that
wasn't
true but somebody should tell zubie
because he thinks he was the person in
the story do you know
zubie you famous uh
musician uh social
media uh personality he's got a lot of
he's got a lot of different talents so
it's hard to describe him um but zubie
famously entered a woman's weightlifting
competition identified as a woman during
the competition and won the
competition now that was a story that a
lot of people in the the right side of
the political world have heard and even
zubie when this was first mentioned
zubie posted on social media on X is he
talking about me or I think he's talking
about me or something like that and I
think he was because I think it's the
most famous story of somebody entering a
woman's competition as a man and winning
so I'm not sure the fact check was right
um but but I'm also not entirely sure
what Trump was
thinking anyway so yes the uh apparently
my idea that Trump is directionally
accurate is a little too dangerous for
the Democrats to let stay out there
without a little push back so they tried
to push back on it but wasn't much of a
push so I came out okay on
that uh Trump is uh teasing that KL
Harris is doing so poorly that the
Democrats must be thinking about uh
switching around a few weeks before the
election I don't think that's going to
happen but I'll bet I'm not I wouldn't
be surprised if it's been uh discussed
she's doing so poorly really worse than
any candidate ever I mean we always make
fun of Dukakis remember when Dukakis ran
and he he rode around in a tank and
everybody teased him and he lost
well duckus was much
better than KL Harris as a campaigner so
she is the worst campaigner in the
history of campaigns as far as I
know
um but I don't think they're going to
switch around I think they're going to
have to live with what they got here
there are reports that Trump is
massively ramping up his security we
don't know the details of that but it
does seem that uh the threats against
them must have ran up and maybe the
Iranian thing is looking bad there's
some indication that maybe he rides a a
decoy plane sometimes and he's not
always in his plane I don't know if
that's true but
um we got to keep him alive
people and there reports that the secret
service is not always consistently doing
a good job and uh it's it's scary stuff
so keep him alive
um according to the Woodward book uh
General Mark Millie is afraid he might
be court marshaled if Trump
wins interestingly Mike Benz who knows
more than we do about things uh has been
saying for a long time that eventually
the evidence about January 6 will point
to Millie now I don't know exactly what
the accusation is but my guess is that
it would be something like Mark Millie
might have
intentionally allowed the situation to
get out of hand or Worse may have been
part of instigating things that made it
get in a hand now that's not an
accusation from me I'm just saying that
if it's true and Mike Ben is highly
credible and as has demonstrated great
Mastery of the the uh
information about all things political
it seems but uh
maybe maybe
it doesn't feel wrong to me but I also
don't have backing for it so I can't say
it's true
um but I will be interested to see if
anything about Mark Millie comes out I I
have long had a feeling about
him and my feeling is he doesn't look
like he's exactly on my
team but it's just a feeling so we'll
see if there's any anything that would
uh be suspicious about his activity is
maybe someday we'll know uh New York
Post says the feds have deported some of
those Isis migrants who slipped into the
country um some would say that most of
them have been in prison the whole time
so they weren't dangerous but uh it
reminds us once again that we need a
secure border not whatever is
happening um has Israel attacked anybody
in the last
hour because we're waiting for it this
weekend so the smart people are saying
probably this weekend Israel is going to
do some kind of a a response to a ran uh
some say they're not going to attack the
nuclear facilities some say they might
some say they're going to attack the uh
the oil producing
facilities uh they
might they
might I don't know if they're going
to you think they're going to attack
Beirut they might
um I don't know we'll
see uh then there's reports of some kind
of a
um some kind of maybe there was a Cyber
attack already on Iran's nuclear
military assets I don't know if that's
true and what do you
think you think it's going to be massive
because it's massive Iran probably will
respond if it's a decapitation strike
which would be gutsy big
risk um then I don't know how they
respond because they would have to
figure out who's in charge that could
take a
while I don't
know there might be something lighting
up this weekend but we'll find out um
I'll give you some advice that I would
like to give well I'll just give you
some
advice um you're probably feeling
feeling more anxious than you
have maybe much of your life but a lot
of that is that the news is just
saturating you with bad news and scary
things more than ever so we're probably
not in any worse shape survival wise
than we've ever been at any time in the
country in fact we're probably in better
shape uh riskwise than maybe any time in
history now that doesn't mean
everything's going to go right but if
you were looking at risk reward and
compared us right now to any time in
American history it'd be okay it's not
like everything's falling apart we've
had about this many complaints before
gotten out of
it but uh you know the the thing I would
advise is that the odds of your lights
and your water being disconnected for
much longer than normal are above
anything I've ever seen
so I would advise you to get a little
extra food and water get some batteries
get some backup
generators uh talk to your neighbors
maybe get a little more organized about
who can do what who does what when um my
understanding is that you can get a um a
starlink you know internet device that
can be powered just by a small camping
generator like one that uses
so it doesn't use a lot of electricity
so I'm thinking of getting one just as a
backup Elon Musk actually suggested that
it's not a bad idea so it wouldn't be my
primary internet but um I did buy two um
solar
recharging small generators so I could
do small appliances I could run a fan or
charge my phone I could keep one
refrigerator running um but I could also
run my starlink
now I might run out of electricity in
the evening but then I can recharge it
and start over the next day so Amazon
had some so I put it in order I'm
surprised that they had any left so they
haven't actually shipped it I'm not sure
if they'll ever be able to ship it
because my brain just tells me that
there are too many hurricanes going on
and that they probably already were
bought out but um you should all give a
little more thought to being able to be
self-sufficient at least for a while I
can't tell you how long I mean some
people are talking about the whole grid
being taken out and you know we're
powerless for
months
maybe I would bet against it I think the
odds are against that but the odds of
losing power for a week are pretty
high the odds of losing power where you
live for a week just based on either a
natural disaster or based on a half or
something like that pretty good the odds
of losing your power virtually
permanently you know some catastrophic
attack the
network low but definitely a
possibility but
low
um I I heard there were some problems
with some of the natural gas generator
backups um but I don't know what those
problems are
uh I'm I'm short of being a
prepper but I'm uh I'm prepper
adjacent yeah I'm prepper adjacent I'm
right in that General thought category
but not quite a
prepper
um 12 days yeah
a lot of people put in
generx well I priced mine it was
$100,000 so I decided not to do
it I might look into it again maybe with
a different
company all right ladies and gentlemen
that's all for today I'm going to talk
to the locals people privately thanks
for joining if you're on X and Rumble
and YouTube remember to get the dilber
calender you can only get it at

the process that I can't kill so I I
don't have a way to make the stream
stop so you might not see it but if you
don't see it on one platform look for it
