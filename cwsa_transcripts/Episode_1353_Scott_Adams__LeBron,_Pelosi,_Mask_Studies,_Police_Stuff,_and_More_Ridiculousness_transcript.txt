hey everybody come on in come on in
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day
and today will be well it's going to be
a good one
a barn burner if you will hello sweden
good to have you in the house arizona
nice to have you
yes people from all over the world
pouring in to enjoy the simultaneous sip
and all you need to enjoy it to its
maximum potential
and really why would you settle for less
all you need is a copper bunker glass a
tanker chelsea stein that canteen drug
or flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i
think i may have mentioned i like coffee
now join me for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope meaning of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called
the simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen
right now go
so i'd like to say something about that
uh
chauvin trial that i haven't heard
anybody say directly
so let me say it the judge
was really good in my opinion just the
parts we could say
and i didn't see much pushback from
anybody else i think
you know there's a there was uh the
dershowitz
um observation that maybe he should have
done more
to keep the jurists away from the news
but really really how do you keep these
jurors away from the news
they had a year of the news before they
even got selected
nothing changed after that point
so they were already tainted there was
no way to have a fair election
or a fair trial but uh i think the judge
did a good job in a difficult trial i
would also say that the attorneys
both did good jobs i think the
defense and the prosecution were both
on their game so
at least we can take some comfort in
that
take some comfort and the fact that all
the professionals and i think even the
the jury we'll talk about that i think
they
they were serious people doing pretty
good work
and when you see that in public you
forget to call it out sometimes
because we like to focus on what went
wrong but at least those professionals i
thought really
um they they should make you proud
as an american the judge and both and
all of the attorneys
should make you proud um
there's some more good news the
perseverance rover up there on mars
just turned some carbon dioxide into
oxygen
did i mention on mars
this is one of those stories where it's
so mind-boggling
mind-bogglingly awesome
that there's nothing you can say about
it except say it twice
the united states just put some hardware
on mars that turned carbon dioxide into
oxygen
on mars this was after
testing out their flying helicopter
on mars it's like anything that ends
with
on mars is just still impresses me i
hope i never get bored by any of this
stuff
well of course the big story is you all
saw that as soon as we thought we were
over
with the george floyd stuff there's a 16
year old
young woman who got shot and killed uh
by police
now if you saw the video
and assuming that there's nothing we
didn't see on the video
that maybe this is the one time video
tells us what
really happened because video could be
quite misleading we know
but it looked pretty clear and to me it
looked like a case
of excellent police work
now of course it was widely misreported
by the illegitimate news
that a policeman killed a woman for no
reason right
some of the reporting was that the the
the
knife was already on the ground i'm
basically completely misreported
uh but now we know from the video that
the police officer
not only did something that seems
clearly within the rules of engagement
but really really good police work so
here's my question
why isn't he being put up for
accommodations
because i get that the public is really
mad at this police officer
but his his bosses his supervisors
they've seen the video they know
that what he did wasn't just ordinary
police work it was really good police
work
as in if i could hire that cop for my
police force
i'd want that cop that was a split
second
put his own life on the line
because we've all seen the george floyd
trial right if you make a mistake in
this context
you're going to jail this cop
put his life completely on the line
derek chauvin
is now in a 7 by 10 concrete cell
23 hours a day for who knows how long
all right this cop took that risk
and took one shot i think it was one
shot
and was accurate and saved a life
so i feel as if if his supervisors i
know that they're going to take a lot of
heat and he's getting doxed and
all kinds of things but that shouldn't
stop you
from putting him in for a commendation
oh somebody says it was four shots
but it uh it certainly
certainly accomplished what he was
trying to accomplish so
uh although you could argue that four is
too many we'll probably hear that
argument
but it does seem to me that if what we
saw on the video
is accurate and there's nothing else
that we're missing i don't know why he's
not being put in for a commendation
and i feel like his supervisors owe him
that
as as just a little bit of counter
persuasion
in the context of everybody blaming him
for being a murderer basically
so i feel like that would be fair now if
there's something we don't know about
the story that would be the usual
situation
and by tomorrow everything we know may
be backwards
so keep an open mind that we might not
know everything about this
even though it looks exactly like we
know everything
about this how many times have we been
fooled when we thought we knew
everything about a situation
so don't be fooled well the biggest news
on social media
and it's quite a jaw dropper
and this should tell you everything you
need to know about the state of
corporate news that it was a big story
that don lemon and chris cuomo told the
truth about a story
i'm not making that up that's not an
exaggeration
it's big news on social media anyway
it's big news that don lemon and chris
cuomo
told the truth about a story that we can
all see clearly because it's on the
on the the video the about the young
woman who got killed by the police
and um here's what
don lemon actually said um
he said that when police roll up on the
scene
they see people tussling around someone
has a knife and their job is to protect
and serve
every life on that scene
protect and serve every life
that's what don lemon said police job is
to
protect and serve every life on the
scene
that gets really really dangerously
close
to saying all lives matter isn't it i
mean it's not the same
you're saying that their duty is to
protect and serve every life
on the scene but does that imply that
every life matters
because i feel that that would be kind
of racist
at least that's what i've been told by
cnn
so i don't know if this means that um
that they've gone full racist because
they're doing the thing that i think
they consider racist
saying that every life matters but maybe
that's a different concept so they can
lo get away with it
over in india the kovit is raging and
they've got a new
death high and a new infection high and
i'm wondering what this does to the
skeptics
because didn't we believe the ndu was
doing fine because
uh allegedly they were taking malaria
drugs like hydroxychloroquine
and allegedly they had lots of sun maybe
not as much
air conditioning in some cases maybe
they had
they had some kind of herd immunity
already
but maybe none of that's true so if
there's one thing we know about
coronavirus is that we don't know
anything about coronavirus every time we
think we know something
it just turns out not to be the case
it's pretty consistent
so what do we know about india
nothing really right yeah it's a double
variant
but i can't believe it's only in india
right
severity seems low somebody says well
i imagine that part of this is that
their data was really bad
before and maybe maybe it's improving or
maybe the numbers are just so big that
even bad data can't hide it anymore
but we don't know exactly what's going
on in india and that's kind of like
everything else
where we don't know exactly what's going
on with any country
it's just um baffling to me
that we still can't sort out why
anything is happening
why is it going up why is it going down
now we think it's because
at least in this country vaccinations
and that's a pretty good theory i think
that's probably true
all right singer ted nugent who is a
cove denier has coveted and says it's
the sickest he's ever been in his life
but it looks like he'll survive at least
so far
so i don't think that'll change his
opinion about how dangerous it was
as long as he survives but we'll see
one of the reasons to not be a
coronavirus
skeptic i feel like the universe
owes it to you to give it to you if
you're a skeptic
like you've got a little extra danger
not in any rational scientific way but
does this seem like if you talk out
about
uh as soon as you become an advocate for
something you're gonna get that thing
it just feels like he's begging the
the universe to give it to him
yeah ted nugent is quite a healthy
weight
and so even though he's a certain age
i feel like he'll he'll get through this
fine
we hope so nancy pelosi went full racist
yesterday here's what she said
in public she said thank you george
floyd for sacrificing your life
for justice because of you and because
of thousands
millions of people around the world who
came out for justice your name will
always be synonymous with justice
that sounds racist to me and i had to i
had to think about it for a while to
figure out why
because my first reaction is just
there's something wrong with this
but it's hard to put my finger on it
exactly and here's what here's what i
think bothered me about it
it's overtly racist isn't it
because i can't imagine this being said
about a white person
it feels like this is only something a
an old white lady would say about a
black person
and here's what's killing me you've
heard the phrase about the
soft soft bigotry of low expectations
to imagine that george floyd is a hero
as opposed to just a victim
is sort of promoting him beyond
what feels right for a role model
and there's a fairly fairly consistent
thing that we see on the left
is that they're victims they try to turn
into heroes
and the victims sometimes are not your
best role model
for example uh even martin luther king
was ultimately a victim i mean he was he
was killed
and in his case you know there's there's
more good than bad about
emulating him but there's a consistency
to victims being
martyred and i'm not sure this is a good
strategy
if you look at the strategy on the right
you'll find that the people on the right
idolize thomas sowell
people are very high on candace owens
michael jordan what do those three
people have in common
three people that people on the right
like a lot
thomas soul candice owens michael jordan
what do they have in common
besides being black all right one of the
things they have in common is they
refuse to be victims
and they're uh positive role models
meaning that they're just trying to make
the world better and
you know they're not victims and i just
feel as if
it is such a disadvantage to idolize
victims it's just not a good strategy
now i've said this before the victims
are real and it's true and we can't
forget them and you don't want to
minimize them
but that's completely different from
making them your role models
um it would have been far more
constructive for the left
for themselves the best thing that could
have happened
is to say that chauvin was guilty
according to the jury so you know we've
taken care of that
the jury has dealt with it he's guilty
guilty three times
but that doesn't give anybody else a
pass
and i feel like if you give george floyd
a pass
for his behaviors that led up to it
again
it's the cop who went to jail and the
jury has spoken
but giving giving george floyd a
complete pass
as pelosi did feels like that
setting the bar too low you know
something you do
only for somebody that you had a
negative opinion of
that you didn't think the success was
somehow an option
or something like why would you focus on
the
on the least the least role model kind
of behavior you could ever think of
which was you know drug use maybe some
criminal behavior
resisting arrest i mean that's
such a bad strategy so if you care about
black america
as i do it really it hurts
to watch them accept or
pursue a strategy that couldn't possibly
work for them
right this has nothing to do with me
like i'm not really directly involved
with any of this stuff but i feel bad
that they don't have a strategy that
could work for them
here's a uh little framing thing that
might be fun
you know we keep hearing about uh
everybody's brainwashed right
we hear that the the q anon people
they're brainwashed
we hear that the school kids who are in
critical race theory
the people on the right say they're
getting brainwashed
uh antifa what's up with that are they
brainwashed
how about white supremacists how does a
white supremacist
stay away supremacist probably
brainwashed
what would happen let me just put this
out here this is a thought experiment
okay
what would happen if somebody or some
organization put together
a deprogramming program
but it included all of them
it's the all of them that's the key part
of the idea
so somebody builds an actual
organization with funding
resources maybe they got a web page or a
book or whatever and
and they're they're they built it all to
reprogram people
who have fallen into any kind of
brainwashed cult
like thinking that's unproductive and it
would be completely voluntary
right of course nobody would have to be
deprogrammed
you'd have to want it so you know
there's that
but imagine that you went and said yes
my
organization deprograms people from
brainwashing
we include everything from white
supremacists to antifa
to the school kids who were learning
critical race theory
to qanon and you don't defend
any of your decisions about why
anybody's in that group or out
so you don't say well here's the reason
that we're doing this group
you just take it as a given and you just
offer the service
and you say look i don't it's not even
up to us
to tell you you're brainwashed if you
feel you are we can help you
so you have to come to us but we're
specializing in these groups because
these are the groups who are most likely
to need a little help
that would completely change and by the
way this would be an example of
causing people to think past the sale
to think past the sale if you're talking
about
how to de-program somebody you've
already
gotten them to accept that it needs to
be done
uh speaking of programming the new
the new phrase is get woke go broke
don't buy coke i added that last part
get get woke go broke don't drink coke
so rasmussen is uh
following up on some of their reporting
from yesterday or their polling
uh 33 of black adults say they are less
likely to buy coca-cola because of the
company's involvement
in the georgia election law controversy
as new
35 percent of white adults and 44
percent of other
non-white adults so
black adults and white of white adults
almost exactly the same opinion at least
you know the 33 to 35 percent of them
say they'll buy less coca-cola products
because of
coke getting involved now if these
numbers
are anywhere near close and i'm sure
that they are
at least in terms of what people say
they're doing but whether that
translates into actual actions is
separate
but how would you
imagine now the first wave of corpus
ceos who got involved in the georgia
stuff
they didn't know exactly how that was
going to go maybe they thought it would
be a plus
because it would make them look good as
a company but now they know it's not
what happens to the next ceo who thinks
they should get involved
well the next ceo doesn't have the
luxury
of knowing it won't work
because coca-cola just proved
it doesn't work for profits i mean it
might work for whatever their
social objective is but it's not going
to work for the stockholders
and ultimately that's that's their
primary goal
is to make stockholders happy
even if they say it's not so
what happens to the world now that
there's an uh an official
national polling company that says
effectively through the data it says
that
getting a little too woke is a disaster
for your company
what happens to the next one they can't
claim they didn't know
here it is i mean you could google it
you can check it so any any ceo who
makes this mistake
in the future probably needs to get
fired
because now you know what the outcome is
before you didn't
so the ceo of coke you could agree with
him or disagree with him but you'd have
to agree
that he couldn't have known how this
would turn out
couldn't have known but the next one the
next one knows
they can't do it i think it's done i
mean i think this might put a
damper on things you should expect uh a
series of dilbert cartoons
uh focusing on the ceo getting woke
and what that does to profits within
dilbert's company so we'll see a little
bit of that
um not in the same topic the wokeness
but i'll come up with some
you know analogous wokeness that doesn't
get me in trouble
um we got some new fake russian news
you know i don't feel like we can go one
month without some fake russian news
so here's the fake russian news
which could turn out to be true let me
say this as clearly as possible
this news which i'm calling fake i'm
only calling you fake because it looks
so obviously fake
but anything's possible right is there
some chance i'm wrong yeah yeah just
like everything else right
there's always some chance but let me
tell you the story and let me see if you
think
this is real news or fake news
u.s intel officials have identified
russia
as the likely culprit now isn't that the
beginning of most stories
i feel like 25 of all of our national
stories are
they start with this u.s intel officials
have identified russia as the likely
culprit
and then you just fill in what's the
rest of the story but they all seem to
they all seem to start with that don't
they
well we think russia is the culprit
we're not going to show you the proof
but we've got it not only do we have it
but we
convinced 16 other intelligence agencies
that we really have it and they say we
have it too so they agree with us which
makes
17 intel intel agencies on the same side
how can you doubt us now but here's the
story
that uh has ident our intel has
identified russia as the likely culprit
apparently there's a secret suspected
neuro weapon yeah a weapon that can
scramble people's brains from a distance
possibly or probably the same
secret weapon that was used against our
embassies
in cuba and then something in canada
happened as well
so all these people with headaches and
actual verified brain damage
and it seems to be coming from
a weapon that nobody's ever seen
nobody's ever seen it but it's a weapon
and it's probably the russians
somebody says it's smartphones oh you
troublemaker you troublemaker
yeah now i don't think it's smartphones
but um you do have to wonder uh
what are the odds that this is a real
story well i would say that given
especially the source that i saw it from
i'm guessing this is an intel
fake news it doesn't look like a real
story to me
now i want you to all remember that i'm
making this prediction
because i've been making it since the
cuban
neuro weapon story that it's completely
fake news
there is no neuro weapon being aimed at
our diplomats or our soldiers
that that's my prediction if i'm wrong
i'm wrong but i'm going to be
spectacularly wrong
but i'm not wrong until you see the
weapon
right if you don't see the weapon you
got a little bit of a bigfoot situation
why can't we ever get a good picture of
the weapon
all right um
i've told you there's a trap called the
skeptics
trap which i just gave a name to and it
is that once you become known as
that skeptic on whatever the topic is
you you have
a great incentive or
pressure to just keep being that skeptic
even if the information is no longer
supporting your skeptical claim
and i feel like this is a trap that is
going to happen to a lot of our
coronavirus
skeptics even if they're right about
some stuff so
skeptic dr naomi wolf got booted off a
twitter temporarily
um hold on
um so naomi wolf got booted off twitter
for
tweeting about a study that she claimed
came that came out of stanford which she
claimed was peer review
in which the study claimed that masks
don't work
so you say to yourself wait a minute
that sounds pretty good
stanford study peer-reviewed
wow we finally have proof that maths
don't work except
it wasn't really stanford and it wasn't
peer-reviewed and
it's completely non-credible so totally
debunked
and i think i'm not positive but i think
this is probably the same thing that
steve cortez got bumped off of twitter
he's back
but i think he might have gotten bumped
off because the same fake study
so there is a there's a fake study
that says mass don't work it's
attributed to stanford they had nothing
to do with it
it looks like it's just a fake study so
she got trapped by that
i don't think she knows yet that it was
fake
ellen dershowitz says weighed in on this
chauvin outcome
and he seems confident that it will be
reversed in the supreme court
largely because of the too much news
seeping into the jurors and and they
being at personal
risk um based on their uh
based on their uh knowing they had
personal risks so we think that maybe
they didn't use the facts
now as dershowitz points out and i think
this is important
it doesn't mean shoving is innocent
just because the trial may or may not be
reversed because the
jurors were too influenced by
potentially
outside statements by politicians etc
that doesn't mean they got the wrong
answer it just means you have to reverse
it
because there would be too much of the
wrong kind of pressure so you couldn't
feel
couldn't feel it's a credible outcome
even if it was the right outcome
so i always make this distinction
between what is credible
from what is true or right they don't
have to be the same
you know right you can have a credible
study that's wrong
you can have a credible opinion that's
wrong
yeah and um i'll say again
that the jury played this perfectly
and uh um until i get counter
information
which is very likely you know we could
find out tomorrow that the jury is
a bunch of nerdy wells who just wanted
to break the system
who knows anything could happen but as
of now
in the same way that i assume innocence
until proven guilty
which i did with shelvin i presumed his
innocence as hard as i could
and then when the jury spoke i accepted
that
you know i didn't watch the evidence
like they did if their opinion
unanimously is guilty
i'm good with that now there are two
possibilities that they voted guilty
on all accounts one is that they thought
he was guilty on all counts
right we're not going to rule that out
are we
that they actually just voted their
conscience they all thought he was
guilty on all counts boom go home for
the day
maybe the other possibility and by the
way if that was
if that was their legitimate opinion
they saw the evidence i didn't
not all of it i accept that as a
credible outcome
but what if
they were really sending a message to
the rest of us
by so quickly voting guilty on all three
counts
that even the most optimistic of us said
huh that's a little bit too on the nose
isn't it like it's a little bit too
exactly
what what the uh let's say the
protesters
etc wanted it's a little too on the nose
feels like a message it feels like a
hostas
message that that we got that said
effectively we don't know what to do
we're in trouble we're going to vote
three guilties
get the message and if that was the
message
i think the supreme court is going to
hear it meaning they're going to hear
that maybe the jurors were sending a
message
just speculation right pure speculation
can't read minds i don't know what
anybody's thinking
i couldn't know that but but
so far the facts suggest
two interpretations which are both valid
at the moment until one of them gets
ruled out by
future uh somebody says stockholm
syndrome
maybe maybe a little bit of that
what is uh disengagement syndrome i
don't know what that means
yeah it would be a stealth kind of
jury nullification basically they would
just kick it up to the higher courts
knowing that it would get overturned but
in the meantime they've covered
themselves perfectly
which i would respect i mean if they did
it just to protect their families i'm
okay with it
they have that right let me say this
i'd love to see your opinion suppose
there were
you had a juror let's just take it as a
hypothetical
who legitimately felt that his day his
family would be in danger
we won't even make it him or herself
we'll just say
their family would have been in danger
and they vote
to save their family but it puts a let's
say a person in prison
did they make the right decision
what do you think did they make the
right decision if they protect their
family
but it puts them hypothetically an
innocent man in prison i'm not saying
that chauvin's innocent
i'm saying hypothetically would that be
okay
with you somebody says i would drop out
of the jury yeah that would be the
that would be the smarter play right
yeah i think whoever said i would drop
out of the jury that's the only
legitimate play
uh but i don't know if you can do that
if you get all the way to the end
that's a pretty tough decision if you've
gone through the entire trial
because you don't want to be the one
that wastes everybody's time
that's not good either that's not going
to help you so if you don't drop
out sort of right away i'll tell you
when they could have dropped down
the day that there was a public
statement and they probably heard about
it
yeah the the day that maxine waters made
her statement
any of the jurors could have stood up
and said i'm out
and nobody would have faulted them would
you
if we had spent millions of dollars in
all this time to have this trial
but the minute that maxine waters was
done speaking
in what sounded like a threatening way
if one of the jurors had stood up and
said
your honor i'm out here's the reason
and you can't keep me here i'm out
and just walked out the door would you
blame them
would they go to jail would they be in
contempt of court
i don't think so i don't think so
i think all you'd have to do is play the
maxine waters video and say look
i'm out it wouldn't matter what anybody
said
no listen to it i'm out i'm out
there's no conversation there's no
argument there's no debate
listen to this i'm out i'm now going to
walk out that door
i'm no longer on your jury you guys can
work it out
but i'm out no
as long as you did it professionally as
long as you did it with full
transparency you could just walk right
out the door
i don't think you would get a penalty
for that
now of course the judge could probably
try to twist your arm with
threats or whatever but i don't think
he'd stop you
in the end he or she would let you walk
right out
completely legitimate for an american
citizen
to protect their family completely
um all right contempt of court yeah i
just don't think that
that the judge would pull the trigger on
contempt
if it's even an option i don't know if
it is
um
somebody says it's a it's a message not
stockholm syndrome let's see that
opinion
jury has not experienced violence or
been saved by their captors
yeah but you know the stockholm syndrome
uh
if you're talking more generally if
you're just sort of
you know trapped with a bunch of people
and you've got certain influences on you
it's not exactly stockholm syndrome
correct but you know you can you can
feel that it's in that same direction
somehow
uh alternate juror would take over well
they had already been
uh released at one point but yeah if
it was before that you could you could
do that
all right i think that's all i needed to
say today
so i'm going to go do some other things
because i think we've covered all the
news that we care about
and remember my dilbert nft
is for sale until may 1st i don't think
people will bid it up until just about
the last day
so keep an eye on that and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
