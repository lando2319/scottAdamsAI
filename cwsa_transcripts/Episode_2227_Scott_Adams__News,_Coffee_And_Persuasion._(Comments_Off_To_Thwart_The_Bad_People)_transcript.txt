we can fix that there we go looking
better right now
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
if you'd like to take this experience up
a few notches well this is the place to
do it and all you need is a cover of my
girl glass of tanker Charles's diet and
a canteen jogger flaska vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine end of the day the
thing that makes everything better is
called the simultaneous Sip and happens
now go
ah
if you are on YouTube right now and
you're saying to yourself hey why can't
I comment
it's because it occurred to me that
the commenters
were not organic
it didn't look like organic people it
looked like a bunch of uh
people coming over to say anti-semitic
things which probably had something to
do with depressing my channel
so on YouTube you can't make a comment
but it's streaming simultaneously on the
locals platform
I'll make it private after we're done
because I talked to the subscribers
privately
but you could also watch it on Twitter
right now it's live streaming at the
same time so if you go to my Scott Adams
says profile you should see it right up
there at the top streaming live so
YouTube you're a bad too many bad people
were commenting so you don't have an
option there
all right
um speaking of bad people Amazon shows
my hardcover book being out of stock
that is
probably not the case
now why I'm having so much trouble doing
the simplest thing in the world which is
listing a book on amazon.com and selling
it well I will leave that to your
speculation
has nothing to do with the fact
that I have a political presence I'm
sure
no actually in 2023 you have to assume
that anything that you suspect is true
so it doesn't mean it is true but
whenever there's anything that looks
sketchy and it's not transparent you
can't really tell what's going on and
what isn't assume it's just as bad as
you think you'll be right about 75 of
the time
all right
um let's talk about the news there's a
gigantic lithium discovery
in Nevada Oregon border
and apparently it's it would be the
biggest one
in the world
so you remember you were all worried
about running out of lithium
and do you remember that Elon Musk once
casually said there's plenty of lithium
you're not going to run out
do you remember that and we all thought
no no all the news is telling me we're
running out
how could this one person this Elon Musk
guy we've never heard of why does he
think we might have plenty of it
well it turns out the world is just full
of it it's more of a mining problem but
we'll see if we can make a difference
there with this new new finding if it's
real it's a preliminary report so it may
not be as big as they hope but it looks
like it's promising
I saw I was speaking of Elon a lot of
the news is about Elon Musk today
um I saw him talking about his robot
business
you know the Tesla robots which he sure
will work
like he doesn't have any doubt that they
can build a proper robot that's got I
guess Ai and
and some lithium batteries probably that
last a long time
so but here's here's what Elon said that
I think I said the same thing earlier
not that I beat him to it it was just
sort of an obvious thing that
if his if his robots work and he
believes they will and so do I
it will be his biggest business
that the robots are in the big business
all the other things are like
they're like a warm-up to the real
business
he thinks he might be able to sell
10 billion robots
10 billion robots
I don't know how many Teslas are sold
every year
how many Teslas are sold per year a
million or something I have no idea what
the number is
but it's nowhere near 10 billion that's
for sure
somebody says
but less than half a million
yeah so there will be way more robots
than there will be cars which makes
sense because there'll be robots working
and robots doing security and robots
doing all kinds of stuff
so yes that's why if you look at Tesla
as a car company
you would be missing a lot
because it's sort of an energy company
as well as a robot company and if you
had to bet on cars robots or energy
cars would be the third one on that list
for me
all right well so we'll see
um
so the New York Times is reporting that
universities
are publicly or publicly posting their
their criteria for assessing Dei
diversity equity and inclusion and
apparently Berkeley will give you a
lower score
if you are applying
um if you if you say you prefer to quote
treat everyone the same
if you say you'll treat everyone the
same
you get a low score on Dei
is that mind-boggling
so I'm gonna I'm publicly announcing
right now that I'm renouncing my
Berkeley degree
I don't want to be associated with that
college whatsoever
so I'm I disavow is that a thing can you
disavow your degree I don't want them to
mention me as an alum in any way not
that they would at the moment since I'm
disgraced but they they used to feature
me as one of their like famous alums
I don't want I don't want anything to do
with this the name of that college or
anything else I disavow Berkeley
as a
legitimate institution it's just a
racist entity now I don't want to have
anything to do with racist entities like
Berkeley
all right
um I have a persuasion suggestion
for Vivek ramaswamy now he's really
really good at persuasion and he's
really really good at communicating
but there's one little just a little
tweak I keep hoping to see him make just
it's just the smallest tweak
when he talks about climate change he
has a he has a killer approach best I've
seen
in which he says over and over again
that more people are dying from cold
weather than warm
and if you don't net that out you don't
really know what you're even talking
about
it's crazy to say that more people died
of hate which is also true
unless you say fewer people died of cold
which we don't know is true or not in
any given year but generally speaking
cold is the bigger problem than Heat
Now The Vape point of this out they
tweet in which she there were some news
about people in Europe dying from the
Heat
at the same time people in Europe are
being discouraged from using air
conditioning
so part of the problem is that
not everybody has air conditioning when
the heat is going through the roof so as
Vivek says quite reasonably
you know if you want fewer people to die
maybe a little more air conditioning
because the air conditioning is not
contributing to you know the the problem
as much as the direct deaths of the
people are important
now here's what I would do when he when
I made that claim so I've seen them make
make it live in front of a number of
people if he's talking to a news person
I would make the claim as he does then
more people are dying from cold than
warmth and it's not even close it's I
don't know ten to one or something
so but once you made the claim here's
the persuasive part
usually do you know what happens usually
when he's talking to a host who believes
that climate change is an emergency and
he makes a claim that more people die
from cold than warm do you know what the
host always does what does the host
always do
every time
next question
they won't they won't engage it
they never engage his point
have you seen it watch it you look for
any clip
he'll say more people die from cold than
warm and the host will get you the the
big no eyes
next question
right you you watch for that here's
here's what I would suggest you to do
that he'd do instead make your point and
say you know uh 10 times more people
dying for the cold or whatever the
statistic is and say by the way I would
encourage you to do a fact check on that
because I know a lot of people watching
are wondering if that's even true
so you would be doing your your
reviewers a service if you could do a
fact check on that just check me it's my
it's my primary claim
it's my main claim you know I have other
things to say about climate change but
it's the primary point
so it would be great if you could fact
check it for your audience
imagine saying that
what does your host do
b-u-l-e
willo yeah
yeah well uh next question
that's what's going to happen
you're going to get next question
don't know what to do so that's my
suggestion
um
I mentioned this before but because it
keeps working it's worth mentioning
again Trump said in a speech that his
black support quadrupled or quintupled
after his mug shot came out
now I don't think anybody thinks that's
true or even close to true
but because he said it
CNN has to fact check it so they have
Daniel Dale come on
and he's like no no no
way there's no way that black support
quadrupled or quintupled do you love the
fact that he said quadrupled or
quintupled
that's technique he's trying to make you
think what was it quadrupled or was it
really close to five times
the answer is of course it was nowhere
near any of those
but in the in the process of debunking
them Daniel Dale the CNN debunker guy
the fact checker he says oh no the facts
do not support that we checked five
polls it came out after the mug shot and
only four of the five were up
only four of the five
we're up
now he's careful to point out accurately
that the amount the four out of five are
up is within the margin of error
what what does the public hear
do you think that the average CNN viewer
hears
um it's oh it's within the margin of
error okay okay so now that I know it's
within the margin of error it's like the
same as saying there were no polls at
all
do you think the average CNN viewer says
that
or do they say
four out of five polls say he's up with
blacks
is very much like uh their trick of
doing a a correction long after the lie
because nobody reads the correction
yeah so Trump could just put this out
there and make them talk about four out
of five polls say he's up and the public
is just here four out of five polls now
why does Trump make this claim Let's
test you
why does Trump make the claim
they use way up way up with black Motors
is it because he wants to be fact
checked
well here's the answer I'm looking for
he's trying to make it true he's not
talking about it as if it's true
although he is right talking about it as
if it's true is how you make it true
suppose you're a
uh it could be any kind of person let's
say you're an albonian voter
and you're a low information albonian
voter you're not really paying attention
to politics it's not your thing you're
just getting on with your life but you
catch a news report
that says that Trump is way is way up
with albonians but there's some
controversy about whether it's four or
five times or just four out of five
poles
and you're you're barely paying
attention you're like
wow I guess a lot of people like me
must be liking this Trump guy I better
take a second look
and then you get into the voting booth
and yet really don't know anything and
you haven't paid attention you're like
well I hear a lot of people are liking
Trump
a lot of elbonians apparently changing
their mind on him so I haven't looked
into why
but I like to be on the team with my
other albonians so whatever the
elbowians are doing I'm I think I'd like
to do that
so
because politics is team sport
Trump is basically saying that hey
people people that you would identify
are flocking to me
that's what makes people flock to them
if they imagine other people are doing
it because yeah it's just a bandwagon
hurting the cattle kind of thing and it
would work with any group it has nothing
to do with being black you know any
group if you say they're flocking to you
is more likely to happen
so Trump is right on point with his
persuasion but not his fact checking per
usual
I saw a tweet by Ryan s whoever he is
but he had a smart tweet
SoftBank your Chinese company is going
to buy Albertsons that includes Kroger's
over 400 stores
now that does that bother you that China
is going to own one of our major food
Outlets
oh you haven't even thought it through
yet
as Ryan did
allow me to point out what Ryan pointed
out
Albertsons and Kroger
are one of the biggest pharmacies in the
country collectively
the biggest pharmacies
does this mean I don't know if this is
true does this mean that China will have
access
to what drugs you were taking
does it work that way
or or is somehow the prescription
systems sort of carved out so you can't
get into it
I mean is it may it may be the maybe the
prescription system is more secure
but
but they would have also an inventory
system that would pick up the names I
would think
so I can't believe it would be secure
so imagine imagine China knowing who
takes what drugs
but as Ryan Hess points out is more
disgusting than that
do you want to have your head explode
if China owns the pharmacies for these
major Outlets
they will control the selling of
fentanyl the legal kind
as well as selling the antidote to the
Fentanyl
they'll actually make money
selling you the fentanyl
and then sell you the the antidote to
the overdose for the Fentanyl
is your ad exploding yet
how in the world is this going to be
allowed how in the world does China get
a big piece of our food distribution
Network
how in the world could this be approved
by the
I mean I like I like a free market but
not when your adversaries are buying it
you know I wasn't I'm not terribly
worried about China or Bill Gates buying
a Farmland
because you know with all they have it's
still a small percentage it shouldn't
make any difference but this is like a
major chain store and they're going to
have all their private data and stuff
and what is killing people more than
drugs and bad food
I mean China will now have control of
the biggest weapon to kill Americans
shitty food and shitty Pharma
two big sources of death in America
maybe the biggest possibly combined the
biggest sources of death
so that's all bad
um here's a little uh
a little bit of a trend we're seeing
so on The View
as the Colin rug points out in a tweet
I'm talking about migrants the ladies of
The View
and here are a couple of quotes just so
you can see how silly they are quote
number one talking about all the
migrants in New York City uh they need
to be resettled elsewhere
this is the ladies of the view the
migrants need to be resettled elsewhere
they need to spread out they need to be
spread out where where this is a massive
country
that's right
so everybody was fine when it was just
the southern states being destroyed by
it
but as soon as some of that pain went
North oh oh it turns out that the people
who were all into their sanctuariness uh
there was a limit to that wasn't it and
the limit was the moment it bothered
them
the moment it bothered the ladies on The
View personally because they have to
walk down the streets now it's not
acceptable anymore
but they also have this Joy Behar wanted
to get in on this conversation and so
she said it's only going to get worse
with global warming and climate change
because people can't live in certain
parts of this world
yeah
it's a level of stupidity
that is beyond comment
like what do I even say about that
like I could say all the obvious things
about it but you're already thinking
them so what's the point of saying them
right
these are the dumbest
people who have the biggest platform
one of the dumbest people have the
biggest platform but the theme I'm going
for is the following
maybe those Republicans were right about
a few things after all
so you see the ladies of you now realize
that Democrat immigration policy is
obviously a disaster
obviously
here's another one you know about the
New Mexico Democrat Governor who wants
to suspend the Second Amendment
and at least for 30 days
you wouldn't be able to have what is it
concealed or open carry or something
and
they couldn't even get these two people
to agree so here's two people who
tweeted their opposition to the New
Mexico governor
so essentially suspending the Second
Amendment on our own one of them is
David Hogg
David Hogg one of the most famous
anti-gun you know survivors of the mass
shooting and one of the most notable
voices for gun control
and he says directly you know no bueno
we're not overturning the Second
Amendment
even Hogg
even Hogg says that
Ted Liu famous critic of all things
Republican guess on Twitter same thing
I like gun control but no we're not
overthrowing the Second Amendment too
far
so even even your
you know your vocal uh but not crazy
people now do you remember it wasn't
long ago
that you all gave me a hard time when I
said Ted lose not crazy
do you remember that it was only like
within the last month wasn't it where I
was telling you that you can't judge Ted
Liu like you know Adam Schiffer swalwell
or something you use it in his own
little category he's partisan he's very
partisan but he's not crazy
as as this tweet proves right so he's
showing you that he has an independent
mind and and there is such a thing as
too far and I appreciate that so give a
shout out to Ted Liu and also to uh
David Hogg while I would largely
disagree with her other views on on
stuff
good citizens right now
yeah on this on this item just good
citizens
all right uh and even uh Jank uyghur
yeah from The Young Turks
he's saying over and over again on
Twitter and I think he's just doing a
good a good service for the country
doing this the Biden's too old and the
Democrats need to get they need to
figure this out really quickly because
because uh jenk doesn't think that Biden
can win I don't know about that
maybe you can win but
you're seeing a lot of Democrats
coming out against Democrats
and yeah a lot of Whispers that they're
not happy about buying more Whispers but
they're not happy you know with Harris
being the backup
so
are we seeing any kind of a trend
or or these little anecdotes just kind
of a coincidence because it feels like
the utter Insanity of the you know the
leftist you know the farthest left
opinions are now being a little bit
obvious even to Democrats
and that and their sense of team play is
being challenged you know why would you
want to be on this team some might be
asking themselves
well Gavin Newsom says oh he's not
running he's not running let me give you
his actual tweet
and I want you to look for read between
the lines and then I'll tell you what I
think has happened and will happen
all right because we're we're all just a
we're going to speculate so I'll read
you his actual quote
so Newsome said in answer to the
question well I think the vice president
is naturally the one lined up
the vice president Harris is naturally
the one lined up
now is that what you say when you're
giving a full-throated endorsement
to somebody on your team
well I think the pr the vice president
is naturally the one lined up
so naturally lined up
because you know if you're picking a
next president
the one the one thing that you're really
concerned about is who's naturally lined
up
that that's your big tell isn't it all
right so he goes on
uh and the filing deadlines are quickly
coming to pass
huh
and I think we need to move past this
notion that he's not going to run
let me read that again and you tell me
what attitude you're picking up from it
and the filing deadlines are quickly
coming to pass
and I think we need to move past this
notion that he's not going to run why
did he need to mention the filing
deadlines or quickly going to pass
that feels like they didn't belong there
right
it feels like a little sour grapes
a little sour grapes are you picking up
a little bit of dissatisfaction
I am
it's an interesting way he's wording it
isn't it yeah it's it's you better call
me in the next 10 minutes or you're
really
right that's what I hear you've got 10
minutes to call me I don't think you're
going to do it you and good luck
because I'm your only your only hope
basically like that yeah I mean I can't
read his mind
but when I read his words that's what
I'm hearing right so I can only be
responsible for what I'm receiving I'm
not responsible for what he is thinking
or saying
um
and then he says President Biden is
going to run and we're looking forward
to getting him reelected
is that what you say about a really
strong candidate
he's going to run
okay that's a ringing endorsement he's
going to run and we're looking forward
to getting him elected
that's a lot about not Biden isn't it
he talked about process
so instead of saying we have the
greatest candidate of course he's going
to run
he talks about the process
read between the lines he obviously
doesn't think Biden is qualified
obviously nobody does
and he says I think there's been so much
uh wallowing in the last few months and
hammering in this respect but we are
gearing up for the campaign we are
looking forward to it
we're looking forward to it
we're not we're not looking forward to
Joe Biden being president
we don't think he has the qualifications
because maybe that would be the time to
mention it
yeah don't if somebody's going to be
your candidate and you're going to
support them you don't have any good
words to say
how about how about this would the way
it be the way to say it if you are not
planning to run and you were happy with
the current situation here's how you'd
answer that
well I don't know why anybody would be
looking to run we've got the strongest
team we've ever had we've got Joe Biden
who's done 10 great things he'll
probably do 10 more great things I just
talked to him yesterday and if you think
he's got any cognitive disabilities I
mean I talk to him personally I can tell
you he doesn't he's looking strong and
Kamala Harris she doesn't get enough
credit for all the things she's done but
she's in every meeting she's part of the
process and she is ready to take over
any time but you don't have to worry
about it because Joe Biden is so healthy
I can I can assure you I talk to him
personally he's fine he's right here
he's raring to go he wants to get out
there his staff is holding it back a
little bit but they can barely keep up
with him
right
that's what you say when you think you
have a coherent president with a capable
vice president candidate and you're
backing them here's what you don't say
looking forward to getting him reelected
gearing up for the campaign
we're looking forward to it
he's not a happy guy
do you hear it too or is it just me to
me he sounds like you tried and failed
here's my further interpretation this is
purely speculative not reading any minds
and I don't have any inside information
what is what it feels like to me
is that Gavin has been maneuvering to be
the substitute
and it didn't work
and I think that the only person who's
saying no is Joe Biden himself
and he has the ability even as
cognitively declined as he is by his
position he can simply say no
and I think that Biden is saying no
because he needs to stay president to
stay out of jail and to keep keep Hunter
out of jail and the rest of the family
well mostly just Hunter I guess now to
me it seems obvious that even a Gavin
Newsom knows that Biden is only running
to protect himself and his family and
this has nothing to do with the country
because the fact that even Gavin Newsom
couldn't say a freaking positive word
except that the Kamala is next in line
and they're looking forward to getting
him reelected
not a single positive word about either
one of them
there's no way he's a happy camper
and there's no way that the Democrats
are happy that he's running
I think the Democrats do not want Biden
running
and I think the conversation has
probably gotten pretty tense and I think
it looks like Biden's going to run out
the clock
so if Biden runs out the clock and other
people don't file because he's just sort
of keeping them from filing
you know he could have a stroke the day
after the filing deadline passes are you
still going to be your candidate
all right
so I uh an alarming video from a
influencer Twitter on Twitter but also
Tick Tock a tick tock influencer a young
guy named Chris Mowry he was talking
excitedly in his car on camera about how
good bidenomics is because you know what
if there's one thing
that young Maybe
20 something looking guys care about to
do Tick Tock videos they're really
deeply into bidenomics
but thank you to community notes on
Twitter I mean X for uh noting that his
talent agency is paid by the DNC
now imagine you're on tick tock
and you see this influencer say oh Biden
economics binomics is so good so good
inflation is coming down manufacturing's
up job's good and he's just really
excited about it
if you didn't know that he was being
paid
by the Democrats literally paid to say
this you would think it was real
wouldn't you
of course you would
and if you thought that other people
like you
thought that Biden was great
you wouldn't put much thought into it
you'd like well he thought about it you
know this guy thought about it and I'm
like him
you know I've got a lot in common with
this person I follow so if he likes
Biden maybe I like Biden too because I'm
not going to look into it economics are
boring and if a tick tock influencer
says bionomics is working well well case
closed The Tick Tock influencer told me
I'm sure he looked into it in some depth
so what a service these Community notes
do and imagine that you don't see them
on tick tock
Tick Tock just thinks this is a real
opinion
speaking of real opinions and
interesting development with our
favorite
person on the x-platform
Rob Reiner
we all know Rob Reiner from
TV and movies very successful actor
slash producer
and we also know that he is very active
on the x-platform uh very anti-jump
and have you ever said to yourself man
that guy seems crazy
and man it's like he's impervious to new
information
and man it's like he fell for every hoax
how could one person fall for every hoax
and so it didn't really seem right did
it
it seemed like is there something wrong
with him does he have some kind of
mental problem or or you know did Trump
once steal his girlfriend when they were
teenagers like what's going on it just
like it didn't seem right
right
well uh in comes uh Mike Benz b-e-n-z a
real good follow he's at Mike Benz with
a z cyber all one word Mike Ben's cyber
I highly recommend you follow him if if
it's only for this
so here's what he said
and
it was to look into the
impact on the election in 2016.
and on his organization
uh where three CIA Chiefs
who are his advisors
do you see it now
and
um so I'll let me read Mike benz's tweet
in this
so uh Mike had said before he knew there
was any connection
he had said that in his opinion his
experience that Ryder was talking like a
CIA asset
and that there's a way that they talk
and he describes it humorously as like a
cocaine fueled
um almost almost psychopath
immune to new facts you know just it
seems like pure propaganda
so he noticed the the tell
in Rob Reiner's tweeting that he just
tweets like he's a CI agent
and he does a little bit of research and
it didn't take much
to find out that he's actually friends
with most of the CIA top guys
they're his advisors on this board that
he created
now
so so here's Mike Ben's uh describing he
says quote this isn't a tweet you can
literally smell it on these people
there's a CIA speak
frenzied energy of a man on cocaine
endlessly and wholly unaccountably
unaccountable believing about democracy
verbal State Department print shop in
other words just saying what this state
department would want you to say and a
psycho's lack of remorse
and then he says he runs an organization
with three CIA Chiefs who all serve as
his advisors
and then he notes as a Hollywood
producer
why is there a Hollywood producer
who's who's good who's got advisors in
the CIA and he's running some kind of a
political investigation that happens to
be bad for Trump
all right so Rob Reiner as Mike says no
background in National Security or
Foreign Affairs just a humble little
Hollywood producer who just so happens
to have three Chiefs of the Central
Intelligence Agency in this year
how about that
um but it goes further
three of the CIA directors serving us as
advisors are also on something called
the Atlantic Council
Michael Morrell Michael Hayden Leon
Panetta
the Atlantic Council
I wonder if they have any funding oh
yeah so Mike did some research found out
that the Atlanta Council uh they're
sponsored by who's this company
I don't know if you've heard this
company before barisma
burisma
have you heard of them before
it's a Ukrainian company I nobody's ever
heard of it but I guess they're one of
the sponsors of this Atlantic Council
there's a bunch of CIA related people on
it who are also on Rob Reiner's board
his advisors huh
so
I'm not going to make any uh direct
accusations myself
I'll just point you to Mike's Mike
benz's good work here
how much of this surprises you
are you surprised
does it explain
everything
explains everything doesn't it have you
heard that the CIA historically
directly and with a lot of energy
and successfully controlled Hollywood
controlled other movies looked and made
sure it was all you know very patriotic
and American and we said bad things
about the bad guys and stuff like that
and of course you'd want to join the
military because it's awesome
so
if you were going to influence Hollywood
how would you do it
where would you start
I would start with the directors do you
know why
the famous directors well number one
everybody's heard of them you know so
that they would seem like the smartest
people
you know nobody thinks actors are smart
even sometimes they are but you don't
think but you think the directors are
smart don't you
and you also know
that if you cross a director
you're not going to get work
so the directors are the choke points
for Hollywood
you just need to get a few directors
see what I'm talking about
if you get a few of the big directors
then all of the anybody who might
someday want to work with them or
somebody that they know because the
directors know each other
they don't want to get on a blacklist
so if you're an actor you're going to
fall in line immediately as soon as as
soon as the big directors have an
opinion you're just going to fall in
line
so the CIA only needs to influence half
a dozen big directors and they get the
whole industry
am I wrong
does that make sense
that there's a choke point and it's not
the actors
right you don't need to get Tom Cruise
because nobody believes actors but
directors have a different level of
you know assumed capability and
intelligence because they've done
something that's more like running a
business you know what smart people do
so
it's probably exactly what it looks like
all right now that you've heard this
I'm gonna I'm gonna say one other name
this is not an accusation
all right because I have I have nothing
to back any kind of Suspicion
you ready
Stephen King
now I have I have no indication that he
has any connection with any intel people
none whatsoever there's no evidence no
evidence to suspect
that he's anything but a person tweeting
with an opinion
however he's got a new book out
that uh apparently is so bad
uh let me uh
it was described as pure cringe and
there's a Maga character in the book who
dies of coven for not being sufficiently
vaccinated
the Stephen King book
yep
do you think you wrote that
well let me just say that there are a
number of famous writers
who when they reach a certain point in
their career
are still producing as much or more than
they used to
because maybe they don't write all of it
anymore
so I don't know if he wrote it that's
unknowable and I'm not saying he didn't
I'm just saying it's unknowable for a
person like that
um
but uh I don't know
doesn't it raise some questions in your
mind
did have you ever asked yourself
why does Rob Reiner tweet the same way
Stephen King does have you noticed that
they the vibe is just the same
yeah now again I want to be crystal
clear I'm not accusing Stephen King of
anything because I have no information
that that would be you know suggest that
I'm just saying that you can't trust
anything anymore
you just can't trust anything
all right
um
here's something I did that
probably will cause me more trouble than
it has already
I tweeted that uh
whoever controls the media
controls the country
and at the moment it looked like the ADL
controlled the media
would you say that's a fair statement
based on what we know about the ADL
trying to crash advertisers for the
x-platform
and it appears that that's exactly what
they do their business model so to speak
is they pressure
they pressure news entities to cover the
news in a way that they want and if you
don't do it you're an anti-semite
and the anti-semitic thing comes out
like really easily
just anything they don't like well
that's a trope that's a little bit of a
Trope right there
now
immediately after tweeting this
I was accused of being anti-Semitic
do you know why
because people assumed that what I meant
certainly didn't say it and wasn't even
thinking it was that the ADL is a Jewish
organization and the media are Jewish
have a lot of Jewish owners and
therefore that what I'm really saying my
secret you know racist dog whistle is
that the the Jews are behind everything
so that's what I was accused of
what part did I mention Jews
where was that
I'm talking about Democrats
that there are Democrats in the ADL the
Democrats you know they had in the ADL
used to work for Obama and one of the
clintons I forget which one right he's
just a died in World total
is that died in Wool what does that even
mean he he's just a total Democrat
the Jewish part doesn't have anything to
do with anything except they like
calling people anti-semitic a lot so
you know I spend half of my days arguing
with the trolls on YouTube
that uh that what they think is a this
major Jewish kind of conspiracy
could be a hundred percent explained
their observations could be completely
explained by the fact that Jewish people
are good at school
and they value education
so are we surprised that they have that
there's a high percentage of them in the
best kind of jobs
of course not that should be exactly
what you would say
is that the people who valued education
got the jobs that you need a good
education and they're the good ones the
good jobs
so if you could if you could run a TV
News Network
we're a network
don't you think that'd be a good job
wouldn't you want that
yeah so this is another case where uh I
didn't mention I now you're not going to
believe this next part
but I wouldn't bring it up just to lie
about it
right it wouldn't make sense I would
just sort of Let It Go so I'm going to
bring it up that's my only evidence that
I'm not lying that you know if I were
I'd rather like not not discuss it
but I swear to God it never once
occurred me that anybody would interpret
that as anything about Jewish people
like actually was not in my mind I was
like oh ADL is influenced in the news
the news influences what you think
that's all I was thinking
but they turned it into an I'm an
anti-semite
now do you recognize that play
who was the anti-semite in this story
the one who literally never even
occurred to them that there was any
element of it in the story and I and
there isn't in my opinion
or the people who immediately looked at
me and thought I'm an anti-semite
it's the people who accuse me right the
people who accuse me are in a racial
model
and I just wasn't there
so I didn't even recognize when they
first said it I was like what are you
talking about like I had to piece it
together after the facts like oh you're
saying that because I said okay
yeah the the the people who are guilty
on the Democrat side will accuse you of
the thing they're doing even as they're
doing it like they were doing it
actively doing it
while accusing me of doing it and I
didn't even know what the topic was I
didn't even know we were talking about
Jewish people
you know when did that come up
all right
so that's your situation
um
so I tweeted because it seems like the
government is going after Elon Musk in
too many different ways
yeah they're going after him with the
ADL which in my opinion is operating
like a quasi-government entity it's not
technically but it's operating like a
wing of the Democrats
um he's being sued for
if I understand this not hiring
immigrants
while it would also be illegal to hire
immigrants for his rocket company
because the the government says you
can't hire anybody who's not a U.S
citizen so he doesn't and that he's
being sued for discriminating against
non-us citizens
now that doesn't even sound like a real
lawsuit yeah it just sounds like
so I tweeted
just as I was just thinking about it I
said are the Democrats trying to jail
musk and I said it looks that way to me
it's starting to look like they just
want him in jail because he's too
powerful
and
uh Elon Musk actually replied to that
which is not the tweet I would have
expected him to reply to just hold this
in your mind
so he had I don't think he's replied to
anything I've tweeted
since I got canceled I think he tried
once and then he got piled on and it
wasn't worth it I mean I can't read his
mind but I'll just tell you that he made
one one positive comment about not
canceling humor and he got you know a
lot of for that so he hasn't
commented on anything I've tweeted for
uh nine months or whatever whatever it's
been
but this is what he did
it was about whether the Democrats are
trying to jail him and what he said was
in his tweet something strange is going
on
imagine knowing what he knows
you're right because we know just what's
in the news but he knows
like what's actually happening in his
daily experience and he's even saying
something strange is going on like it
doesn't look organic whatever's
happening it makes you wonder if the
intelligence people have decided to take
him out which is what I worry about
yeah
but uh you might be worried about it too
all right let's talk about this uh story
about uh shoken the this is actually
getting more interesting
so remember the Ukraine's prosecutor
General Victor shoken
so the story as most of you know Biden
said he got the guy fired and he was
proud of it and then when it was found
out that Hunter was
you know working for a brisma
and that there was some note there was
some thinking that the prosecutor was a
problem for brisma so really that's the
reason he was removed and it wasn't
because of any other reason now
um
so uh Miranda Devine of the New York
Post
found some documentation that showed
that the European Commission
actually it praised Ukraine's prosecutor
general shokin for his efforts to fight
corruption
nine days after
Vice President Joe Biden demanded his
ouster
so while Biden was demanding his ouster
the people he said were on his side
were praising him for a job well done
because he met his anti-corruption goals
so
now you can't let that story set right
so
so I'm re I retweet that story Miranda
Divine story and immediately I saw
sources that contradicted it so one of
them for example was from Andres
Backhouse who's always been a a real
good
source and data Checker and fact Checker
of lots of different topics
but he said
that the idea that there was anything
you know sketchy going on there has been
debunked and he showed me a source that
referred to all the people who did want
that guy gone
do you know what the source was
a Ukrainian publication I've never heard
of
a Ukrainian publication
so I said your source is a Ukrainian
publication
and he mocked me
oh oh yeah oh yeah sure it's my source
as a problem right and I thought well
that's weird
kind of weird so I thought well maybe
there are other sources and sure enough
there was ft
Financial Times so after he had an
article in which they went down and and
it mentioned a whole bunch of people
diplomats who who did in fact won and
fired
so by the time you're done with the
article it's like you know this Diplomat
wanted to fire that Diplomat you know
this Source this official so it was a
whole bunch of people who wanted wanted
this Victor shoken fired just like Biden
said
do you want do you want to know the
names of the people
there are quite a few mentioned
no names
no names yeah there's a diplomat
unnamed
but there's also the other diplomat
who agrees with the first diplomat
unnamed
there's a an official
unnamed
there's an organization that is named
but the person in the organization not
named
the entire story was about all the
sources
that were on the same team
and none of them had names
now you say to yourself but Scott but
Scott you know sometimes people like to
be anonymous
these are the people who agreed with the
official Biden Administration policy
you tell me that they're not going to
say that they still agree
if they thought he was if these were
real diplomats
and they really disagreed or though they
really agreed why would they need to be
anonymous
and why would they didn't you know
there's no indication they asked to be
anonymous but ft didn't list their names
do you think they didn't want to be
listed for agreeing with the policy that
the Biden Administration thinks was the
right policy
why would they have a problem with that
why in the world would that need to be
anonymous
and they weren't even called anonymous
they were just called a diplomat
it didn't even say they want to be
anonymous
they were just referred to as this
Diplomat that diplomat
now if you read that article and you
were not a sophisticated consumer of
news
you would be pretty sure that everybody
wanted that guy gone
if you are a more sophisticated consumer
you say
it's a news article about people who
said the correct thing that agreed with
the administration their their
ambassadors which are the people who say
out loud the things that are the right
thing
that's what they do
and yet none of them did
you would immediately spot this for what
it is
you see it right I mean I don't have to
explain anymore it's obvious what's
going on
so
um
well let me read uh Andre's back houses
comment so this was his comment to the
Miranda Divine story
that suggested that
maybe not everybody agreed on his firing
so Andre says quote
I'm always saddened when I see people
falling for dumb stuff
like the claim that the EU is satisfied
with Victor shocken and didn't want to
see him ousted it's such a dumb obvious
lie
do you see it
Andres is in he's like a PhD in
economics
the reason that I followed him for so
long and quoted him so often is that he
never talks like this
he doesn't talk like this
he says well here's a better source
or that source is sketchy because of
this reason
maybe you should look at this one
instead
but on this one thing
it's very personal oh it's very sad it's
sad that you people would agree and then
the best source that he gave was an
obscure Ukrainian publication
to support his point
like what's going on now it could be as
simple as he you know his Pro Ukraine
you know if you live in Germany maybe
maybe you've got some pretty strong
feelings imagine you would but I'll tell
you it's really hard to know
who's giving you straight information
and who's not
all right uh have you are you following
the story of Ashton Kutcher
and uh Danny Masterson who was on that
That 70s Show
so one of the one of the stars of That
70s Show
uh Danny messages I guess he got
convicted of
uh I don't know how many rapes and
sexual abuses or whatever
two two rapes so and got 30 years
somebody saying so it was pretty serious
and apparently the evidence was pretty
strong
but both Ashton Kutcher and Mila
what's her last name
Mila Kunis I guess they had been asked
early on maybe by the family of Danny
Masterson to write character references
which they did
and they that basically they only talked
about you know that
the person they knew so they were not
aware of anything he might or might not
have done so they weren't really talking
to that they were just talking about him
in the positive way because their
interactions with them were positive and
they just put in a video
with more Contrition than I've ever seen
from any two people saying uh
sorry
[Laughter]
we we didn't know about that stuff
what do you think about that
well I would like to offer the following
suggestion
if somebody asks you to write a
character reference
for somebody
I think your best choices are this
either don't do it which is hard to do
if it's somebody you've known and you've
had a good relationship with
or if you do it
definitely don't apologize for it
definitely don't apologize the apology
looked worse than whatever they wrote
I I would have just said this look I was
asked to give a character reference
based on what I know not based on what I
don't know
I said what I know
that's everything that everybody has to
me
everybody asked me just tell us what you
know I did so if you've got a problem
with that it has nothing to do with the
crime because I didn't know anything
about that
yeah if you have a problem with people
having input that is useful to the
process
you better make your case but I'm not
going to apologize for saying what I
knew
and not saying things I didn't know
but now we have evidence that a jury has
found to be conclusive and I'm going to
respect the jury's opinion on that I
don't take back what I said
but it's obvious that there was more to
this person than what I understood no
apologies
that's how I play it the the apology
thing makes them look a little guilty
themselves in some way that I think is
unfair
because I I doubt they knew what was
going on
but you never know you never know
but there's no reason to think that they
did anything wrong
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the best darn live stream
you've seen all day
is there any story I missed that matters
uh uh
person to work with maybe
it's the best ever
all right YouTube
um I hope you found a place to comment
if you wanted to and uh maybe the trolls
will go away oh yeah there's a rufo
story
is that Christopher rufo uh what he's
being uh
accused of what
something crazy
uh oh yeah there was a hit piece so if
you see Vox Vox
writing a story about an individual it's
not true
so there's some Publications which you
don't need to read it to know it's not
true Vox is not a credible Outlet there
there's a negative story about me and
The Daily Beast
today or yesterday I mentioned and do
you think that the Daily Beast
accurately described me
now they called me a uh a right wing
or a far right-wing guy or something the
the very first sentence about me wasn't
true like they're not even on the same
Planet when they start and then they go
on from there now anything in The Daily
Beast about people is not true anything
in Vox about people
no rolling stone
these are not real entities these are
not entities where you read a story and
go oh maybe maybe yes maybe no it's
always no yeah Huffington Post these are
not
uh uh there's another one uh
I can't remember them at the moment yeah
Vanity Fair salon
uh these are not real Publications
Washington Post
yeah the Atlantic right
yeah those are the ones who stay away
from I'll add those to my list
of Publications that you should stay
away from
or not believe say Atlantic
uh Vox
um what was the other one Daily Beast
one of my critics came at me today and
said oh so you you think these sources
are not good so I guess I guess you like
Fox News
to which I said
they they advertise tick tock
you'd have to know nothing about me
to think that I was okay with that
all right
um
here says Putin invaded likely due to
Biden's Afghanistan debacle nobody knows
nobody knows all right that's all for
now thanks for joining YouTube I will
talk to you later
