well come on in here we're going to have
a show like you've never seen
before the show of
shows H that's
weird there we go we got
comments we got
notes it's all coming together
now are you ready for this
wrong
date why what's today's
date no it's the right
date did I put the wrong date on
something like I always
do oh you know me well well well well
well well are you ready for a show
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
I need to make a technological change
right now because I've got a little
problem hold
on this will require my last remaining
piece of
paper now I'm using this piece of paper
to fix my
iPad because it turns out that there's
two versions of me looking at
me there's one on the iPad that's
slightly
delayed that I'm using just for watching
the comments and there's one version of
me that's not delayed and boy you can't
look at two versions of yourself
operating at a different time while
you're doing something live it's
impossible but I just put my last
remaining piece of paper in my entire
house because I was just looking for
paper couldn't find it but that's all
boring to you you don't care what you
care about is a simultaneous sip which
is going to happen now and if you'd like
to join in all you need is a copper
muger glass a tager chales th and a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dop ofine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it's going to
happen right now
go oh so
good oh my goodness so so good
well it turns out that my house is out
of printer paper so I'm using my digital
device to look at my notes and it's just
different we'll see what happens so I
saw a uh news report that people are
using Google Maps and blurring their
house on the map so that burglars can't
tell what their security system is and
how easy it would be to climb over a
fence and stuff like that and part of
the story about uh people blurring their
homes is that uh somebody from the
Department of Justice well actually
Department of Justice says there's less
than uh or fewer than 1% of households
ever experience a
burglary does that sound right to you in
your
experience do only 1% of households
experience a
burglary where where the hell do you
live I don't think I've ever lived
anywhere that didn't get burgled
1% let's
see yeah almost everything I think
everywhere I've lived I've been burled I
think where I live now I've had all the
tools in my garage
stolen when I lived in Dublin all the
tools in my garage were stolen people
would people if I left by uh let's say
when I lived in
Danville all of the tools in my garage
were
stolen I've lost all of my tools three
times
um yeah I when I lived in San Francisco
I came home and my door was open already
I've been
burgled and the neighborhood I'm in now
three of my neighbors that are within
literally a ston throw well one of them
two Stone throws three of them have been
burgled in the last 18
months there there are bands of burglars
that we actually observe casing our
neighborhood literally because we have
all kinds of good security and we're all
connected by WhatsApp so a common a
common thing is you know we're being
cased right now and you can look inside
you can you you can actually see the
automobile that's very clearly people
casing your neighborhood so 1% I think
they need to update that a little
bit of course we'll be talking about RFK
Jr here um but just a couple of things
before that so there's a company I don't
even know this is real so here's
something I just saw on social media and
you could tell me if it's even
real uh there's a company that selling
sunlight at
night now you hear that and you say oh
they're making a light bulb that's like
sort of like the sun no actually and
again I'm not sure this is real so
somebody's going to have to tell me if I
if I got taken by a hoax if I have been
taken by a
hoax um
at least my only defense is well at
least I was a little suspicious but the
story is that there's a company that
sells you an app where you can direct
sunlight at night to your location and
the way you do it is through mirrors on
satellites does that sound true that you
can yeah basically it would be a network
of mirrors so if the if the Sun is on
the other side of the planet the the
series of
mirrors will redirect it exactly down to
where you
are why is everybody saying the date is
wrong oh I wrote the wrong date on
the okay on the live stream do you know
what I did before I wrote the wrong date
on the live stream I was talking to my
pre-show people on live stream and I was
telling them how uh I have a trouble
concentrating writing dates
down and then after the so so that was
the fifth time I had to write a date
down that's part of my morning process
because I published the cartoons Etc so
it was the fifth time I had to remember
the correct date and write it down I got
it wrong in the fifth
time yeah when I tell people that I have
a date related mental problem all my
life this has been since childhood
people don't really believe it
because I've never heard of it before
I've never heard of anybody who couldn't
keep dates straight I just look at them
and I can't write them down it's the
damnest thing anyway enough about me so
I was thinking about this sunlight at
night thing imagine if you had a mil a
military operation let's say you're the
ukrainians and it's night and there's a
operation going on if you could just
turn on the lights on just your
enemy imagine how that would mess them
up imagine being in a night might fight
but you stay you stay in the dark but
use your app to turn on basically the
sun on your enemy I think they can do
that now if this is real all right
there's this there's a article I just
read that
uh apparently there's a big study that
uh there's a lot less alcohol being
consumed by the young and there uh title
of the article was that the young are
being more sober curious so apparently
the per percentage of genes who uh who
drink is way down college students way
down and the way the article seem to um
frame it is that young people are less
interested in
alcohol now that's not exactly my
experience it's true it's also my
experience that young people seem less
interested in alcohol just from
anecdotally but here's what here's
what's missing from the article
and I know many of you can confirm this
I hear about three times a day from
people who are definitely not in the
young people category that they stop
drinking three a
day now it's because I say alcohol is
poison and I'm listening to my own live
stream audience you know uh who are
being influenced by that messaging and
so just within my small live stream
audience at least three people a day
quit alcohol forever ever I've never
seen anything like this so there's
definitely something happening but it's
not limited to young people there there
is something about the understanding of
alcohol and how it it you know how it
influences your life that people are
just saying no to and I don't know that
there's anything behind it you know I
often say that I'm trying to figure out
why it is that when I when I take a
stand to try to persuade publicly on
some issue
I feel like I always get my
way and I've been you know influencing
against alcohol for a number of years
now and sure enough there's this major
Dro in alcohol now I wouldn't say that's
because of me there's something else
going on but it but it it does say that
I am good at picking winning winning
topics you know so if you had told me
that anybody could make you know the
rate of drinking go down in the United
States I would have been skeptical but
apparently I joined the right side I
don't think I caused
it all right let's talk about RFK Junior
I would like to start out by showing my
complete respect and appreciation for
the Kennedy
Shanahan um team for what they've done
um for me they have modeled the the
best American Behavior as I want to see
it now I think americ America has been
going through an identity crisis lately
partly because of the division in the
country that you know you feel like
you're either Republican or you're a
Democrat and the whole idea of being an
American got kind of pushed back a
little bit but then out of nowhere
suddenly RFK Jr and Shanahan are showing
us what America is supposed to be so
here's here's my take of what they got
right which is a lot
number one we watched as they personally
sacrificed for the country personally
sacrificed you saw that RFK Jr literally
couldn't get secret service protection
you know that he is physically in danger
you know that when Nicole shanan started
this she knew that she was going to take
on a lot of grief from the people around
her from the rest of the world and maybe
the rest of her life and it was going to
be super expensive and she had a you
know a family that she needed to take
care of at the same time that she was
trying to help the
country personal sacrifice for the
country modeled in front of you yes
thank you how about uh running an entire
campaign that as far as I can tell
involved no hate no lies no hoaxes no
division no racism or accusations of
racism no gender stuff or accusations of
gender
stuff just
policies just telling you what's
important telling you what they're going
to do about it I've never seen it before
do do let's talk about the dog not
barking these two just ran a
presidential campaign in the United
States for months and months and
months no lies no hoaxes no hate no
stupid stupid racism claims no stupid
gender claims just policies and what's
good for the country it didn't work out
in terms of getting the most
votes but it's what I wanted to
see they also and very American in the
in the best way um they also fought
against huge
odds they they took on a task which is
bigger than just about any task you
could think of trying to change what the
priorities of the country to concentrate
on our medical and food related safety
in my opinion our biggest challenge and
they actually convinced enough people
that it was a big enough
challenge that the the entire mind of
the country is starting to move in that
direction and certainly with the team up
with Trump you're a much stronger case
so when you see individuals trying to
move the country on their own at Great
personal risk you say to yourself hey
one person can't change anything
 one person in this
case one person who got a really capable
partner in
Shanahan change the country now I'm not
just talking about election result I'm
talking about how we think they they
change our
priorities and fix them now not
everybody not right away but you can you
can feel you can sense and feel the
change one person especially if they
have a strong partner can change the
world it just happened right in front of
you that's
American it's American to say you can
change the world and then go do
it all
right so that's that's just my uh
appreciation and congratulations but
let's talk about the
politics um
I feel as
though losing you know a prominent
Kenedy part of the most
famous uh political families in the
country famous for being Democrats and
having him defect to be at least a you
know United partner with Trump not
agreeing with him on policy very clear
on that not agreeing on all the policy
but finding a way to work productively
with uh with Trump it makes you wonder
if this is the death rattle of the
Democrat
Party because you know how things don't
happen until they happen
quickly I feel like there's something
that maybe is happening on the Democrat
side that looks like nothing so
far but you know once the crack forms
maybe it's something bigger have you
noticed this yet remember the
commercials that Apple used to run
against IBM computers back when IBM made
personal computers and the commercial
was or at least the you know the message
was that lots of people will change from
IBM
computers to Apple but almost nobody
changes from Apple to
IBM and that was one of those things
that you hear and you go well you know
that can't be true and of course it's
not 100% true but it's kind of true be
it is a one-way trip when you moved to
Apple products it's really hard to get
back because they just
forum
and so now we've seen Elon Musk a
lifelong
Democrat embrace the Trump team again
not necessarily every policy but that's
not necessary we've seen uh Brett
Weinstein um he's been making some noise
on podcasts Etc in which he's been a
lifelong Democrat and says he doesn't
recognize these Democrats because he
became a Democrat
because he didn't like the uh
the he says the Democrats are now
anti-democratic pro- censorship pro-
forign Wars and de deeply corrupt and he
says that's not the Democrats I signed
up
for now they lose
Kennedy that's about as Democrat as you
can get and four reasons not for crazy
reasons for really legitimate
transparent public
reasons now uh I've told you many times
I'm registered as a Democrat but I've
been persuading on the side of trump for
now quite a few
years I'm Pro Trump I'm not
Republican do you all know that right I
I think I've been transparent about that
I've been a lifelong
Democrat so my only votes have been for
Democrats and you know I've been happy
when Democrats got elected in the past I
like Bill Clinton for example I thought
he was a solid president one of the best
frankly so I too am in the camp of
people who were lifelong Democrat
supporters I feel a little embarrassed
about it but it's true that I was and I
did not become a
republican I didn't become a republican
I became a trump supporter do you know
why because Trump's not exactly a
republican he's a guy who says why don't
we do smart stuff and and I saidwhat
and then Trump said of course I'm making
this up why don't we just do smart stuff
stuff that you know will
work and I thought you have my attention
say more you know close the
border maybe cut the taxes on the
corporate stuff I'm like well all that
makes sense you know if you can if you
can cover your deficit it makes
sense let's have fewer Wars because
there's no real reason for them what
that makes sense so let me say very
clearly I'm not a republican I just love
Republicans I really like Republicans if
I had a choice of who to hang out with
probably
Republicans I like Republicans because
they have a a code of ethics and they
stick to it I don't know what the
Democrats are up to honestly I you can't
even characterize them if I Tred to
describe what Democrats are I'd say uh
I'm not so sure if I were trying to
describe Republicans in the past before
Trump I would have said they're
religious oriented people who are also
involved in
politics so that's how I would have
described the Republicans you know sort
of religion first and that you know that
informs family ideas as well as politics
but starting with religion and then
filtering that through politics in the
days of trump I don't see that I mean
there's there's still a healthy respect
to the religious elements of the
Republican party and you know Trump
respects that but he's not leading with
that he's leading with how about we do
things that make sense how about things
that everybody could look at and say oh
that makes sense like having border
security for example you know just
obvious stuff so how how hard is it for
me to be in support of something that
just makes sense and it's fully
transparent it's easy it's easy it's not
even political that that's why I say
that Trump doesn't even feel political
to me except that he's in a political
process anyway so look for this uh
pattern of PE there's a one-way trip
even people who are sort of rhinos as
you like to call them you know the
people aren't as Republican as you think
they should they're not joining the
Democrats
right is is Mitt Romney going to become
a democ r or support Harris no I mean he
might you know write somebody in or skip
voting for president this time maybe you
know which is a different thing but he's
not going to become a
Democrat all right
so I've got a question for
you I was looking at this meme of uh
somebody made an instant meme of Kennedy
and and Trump you know doing a dance to
uh I don't know I forget the popular
song but I I looked at that thing and I
thought God I love this meme Ju Just
watching Kennedy and Trump do this you
know dance in a in an animated meme
thing and I was trying to figure
out
why now part of it is I like both
personalities so it's two people I like
but I don't know that you could just
take any two people I like and stick
them together and having him dance and
make me happy like what what is it what
is it that's the deeper thing that's
that's reaching me it's not about the
people exactly there's something deeper
going on and I don't know but I'll give
you some
speculations how many of you are old
enough to remember the Rat
Pack you remember Sinatra and Sammy
Davis Jr and some of those other cool
cats Dean
Martin and even though they were uh you
know heavy Drinkers and womanizers and
you know they certainly played fast and
loose with the
rules they were so
cool that you just sort of liked them
even if they had bad
behavior you ever notice that somehow
The Rat Pack became cooler because of
the things they' had in their past you
know you wouldn't necessarily approve of
everything they've done but somehow they
pulled it off and they just look cool
and there's something about that that
Kennedy and Trump both have which is
that even at their current
ages there's there's a coolness that
runs through them that somehow reaches
me now if you if you add Elon Musk to
the party and you add V to the party and
you add JD against the
party you have this wonderfully
diverse in their own way they're diverse
uh diverse group of people who are all
in the same
fight and I've said before that uh the
Trump movement always reminded me of a
pirate
ship that you know the 2016 Trump
supporters were just the weirdest group
of non-regular political people you know
suddenly if Mike cernovich is on your
ship you're not exactly a just a a Navy
ship suddenly you're a pirate ship in a
good way you know if I'm on the ship I'm
I don't belong on that ship I'm a pirate
right I'm I'm there to to do some stuff
so I feel like it's some kind of a rap
pack pirate ship thing but I'm going to
go a little bit more controversial
it's unambiguously
male it's unambiguously
male and what I feel about the you know
where the country is going is I'm just
to say it honestly I don't want a woman
in charge
anymore now when I say anymore because I
think women collectively have had you
know a rising influence and I think for
a lot of good reasons
of good benefits lot of
equality all the all the right reasons
so I'm not complaining about the rising
power of women in America it's all good
you know get what you want get more
power get more equality it's all
good unless your job is to keep me
alive if your job is to keep me alive I
want men
sorry sorry I want men do you know why
because I know
men I know how they act I know how men
act at a deep biological
level and here's what I'm going to tell
you Trump is willing to take a bullet to
fix the
country Robert Kennedy is willing to
take a bullet to fix the country Elon
Musk has heavy
security and he's willing to risk taking
a bullet to save the country V just had
a tense conversation with Van Jones in
the hallway at the I think it was at the
DNC about van
Jones's R rhetoric which caused a death
threat against his wife and
family V is still in the game he's
willing to take a bullet to fix
the
country what's Harris willing to
do take a sip
seriously you've got a pirate ship full
of the strongest people you've ever seen
in your life who have very
clearly sent you the message in in
reality this is
reality willing to take a
bullet do you see that in Harris no in
Harris you see an opportunist who maybe
was just pushed in front of a
parade I don't give a about the
opportunist who was just pushed in front
of a parade she doesn't look like she
would take a bullet for
me so I won't take a bullet for
her that's how it works well I probably
would take a bullet for
her it doesn't work both ways it's sort
of built into being a man you're sort of
raised that you're going to take a
bullet for
somebody so I'm going to be as sexist as
I need to be now but I also allow that
it would be easy to imagine a female
candidate who would take a bullet uh has
demonstrated that you know courage and
would be a perfectly acceptable
president so I'm not going to rule out
that you can't be a woman and be
president because you can't do defense
to the country you can I just don't see
any of it in
Harris and from her Democrat supporters
I don't see any of that energy I don't
see any of the protect the country take
a bullet energy
and sorry my allergies is killing me
today so remember uh all the smart
people are telling us that policies
policies are being pushed aside in both
cases You could argue and that it's a
Vibe
election I I agree with that it's very
much a Vibe election here's the
vibe Harris is dangerous as I saw Brett
Weinstein say in a podcast that the
Democrats look at the moment like an
existential risk to the country I don't
think that's an
exaggeration I think they're an
existential risk to the country now
maybe I've been brainwashed maybe but
that's how I feel and remember it's a
Vibe election so how you feel about it
is going to determine how you act so
telling you how I feel maybe I can't
always defend it with a bunch of logic
and policies but it's how I feel I feel
way way safer if the people making the
decisions about how I live or don't live
are made by people who prefer freedom
and are willing to die for
it that means a lot to me all right
so
um I think the joke I made online is
that uh both Kennedy and Trump would be
willing to take a bullet but Kamala
would be willing to let both of them
take a bullet so she could be president
that's a very different
vibe so um as you know the Democrats
have been trying to laware both Trump
and uh Kennedy but I wasn't aware until
just recently last few days how much
laware the Democrats had sent toward
Kennedy and apparently um there are a
few Mega donors that were behind at Reed
Hoffman one of them funding some of the
lawsuits and Ron Conway's Clear Choice
back so they both sued to remove Kennedy
from the ballot and as some would say
denying some voters their their option
to vote for him
now how much do you love the fact that
Kennedy tried very much to work with the
Democrats I mean there's lots of reports
where he reached out and was
rebuffed and then they tried to sue a
man of
existence and they forced him into a
Unity party with with
Trump this is very much an own goal on
the Democrat side this is very much an
own goal on the Reed Hoffman side they
may have made the biggest mistake in the
history of
politics because he was the wrong guy to
with that's why he's cool too Trump is
the wrong guy to with and I like it
Kennedy's the wrong guy to with too
and I like it
so we got that going
on the big worry that I've seen others
say online is that if it looks like uh
the Kennedy
Trump Elon Musk VI JD Vin Etc team I'm
obviously leaving out a lot of strong
players but you get the idea if it if it
looks like that team's uh on its way to
Victory what would the Democrats and the
guys do to stop
it and I'm really worried that whatever
plan C is because they're already onto
their plan B of KL Harris might not be
working out too soon to say but it might
not what happens if they think they're
going to
lose how deep would the Democrats go in
that in that case I think everything's
on the
table let me give you an example the
daily mail already has a story that uh
RFK Jr's Harvard classmate says that RFK
Jr was a coke
dealer let let me say this as clearly as
possible I don't care what anybody used
to
be you can't make me care what somebody
used to
be I won't I won't buy it do you know
what I used to be in
college not so good do you know what
most people were in college when they
were College age not so hot yeah not so
ethical maybe not as useful to society
as they could have been I'm not going to
vote for a college RFK I mean I'm not
voting for him but you know what I mean
uh no no I don't care what it used to be
I also don't care that KL Harris you may
had some friends help her out I'm not
voting for what she used to be I'm not
voting for what Trump did in his past or
didn't do I mean I don't believe half of
it so but you'll see the uh the type of
attacks just increase and by the way the
fact that um RFK Jr has gone through
what he's gone through drug addiction
he's very transparent about it can can
you believe that RFK Jr was
literally uh addicted to pretty hard
drugs has admitted it
completely um also admitted you know his
let's say marital Fidelity issues
basically completely transparent about
all of his past
flaws and to me it made it all go
away I definitely trust somebody who who
went through something learned from it
turned into a different person I like
that person I like it more than somebody
who never experienced it so a lot of
this stuff about Trump's past and uh and
Kennedy's past aren't really hurting at
all let's talk a little bit more I
mentioned VI ramas Swami and Van Jones
had a little um a little conversation in
the hallway it got kind of tense but
maybe turned into something more
understanding because V uh said very
clearly you said some things about I I
guess van Jones comment was that even
though Trump is a certain age V might be
like a new Trump coming up and you might
have you know you might have Decades of
trumpism as expressed through a V and so
a would be
dangerous and right after that his
family gets a death
threat okay so V is you know connecting
the dots correctly I think and saying
that uh van Jones your rhetoric
basically put my family in danger now
here's what I loved about
it I love that V was defending his
family and and he phrased it that way
and I do think that's the way he was
thinking about it he was thinking about
the effect on his his wife in particular
I don't know if the kids are paying
attention but his wife was quite
distressed by wouldn't you be a death
threat right obviously she's going to be
distressed correctly so and I like the
fact that he defended his wife and he
didn't care who was
listening like as soon as you saw van
Jones he just went into all right I need
you to do less of this now van Jones to
his
credit um after initial maybe brush
reaction decided to listen to
it and he
simply listened to everything that V
said now I'm not going to defend
anything that van Jones did in this case
he he gets to do that himself but he did
say that he would uh um he would
apologize to V's wife he he offered it
it wasn't asked for but he offered it
now you know what I like about
that that I don't think he offered to AP
oliz to the now maybe I missed
that but the van Jones was acknowledging
that there's a you know an extended
family risk here that's going on but you
know maybe he feels that his comments
were accurate but that they had an
effect on the family and he wanted to
make sure that that was unintended
so here's what I wonder will that make a
difference I'd love to I'd love to say
that I thought that uh
people would see that the danger of the
rhetoric was too high and that maybe
they just sort of let that happen
accidentally and nobody had specific
intention to cause any danger but maybe
pull that back a little bit so again uh
V shows his value to the country by very
clearly and publicly saying here's a
line you just cross that
line and Van Jones listening to it now
what he does we don't know
but he listened to it and the message
was very clear and the two of them were
helping the country draw
line now I hope it makes a difference
but boy I love to see two credible
people now if you don't like van Jones
is because he's a partisan I'm a
partisan we're all partisans so I don't
mind the partisan part but he seems like
a real person like you know a genuine
person who wants what's what's good for
the country and his own view of what
that is
well wer General points out that both
candidates are a bit light on policy
details I would say that's true um Trump
has a number of things he wants to do
that he doesn't say how he's going to
pay for it or pay for the debt or pay
for any tax decreases or anything
totally true and uh so both of them are
light on it but everybody seems to be
understanding that policy isn't driving
the ship it's not really a policy
election it's a vibe
all
right um even smes on CNN said that if
the contest were about policy Trump
would win or probably wins now that
would be based on our observation we all
have the same observation that uh Trump
is way ahead in the polls on the top
three or so topics so that would suggest
he would win especially if he's ahead on
the economy which he is and the border
which he is
um but it looks like it's going to be
about personality and
Vibe now if you want to be
impressed at the quality of the
persuasion coming out of the Democrats
and I'm trying to be to to separate the
skill level which is looking really
strong on the Democrats from whether I
like where they're persuading to be I
don't like what they're persuading and I
don't like their candidate but my God
they're good my god I've never seen this
since Obama really now why is it that I
haven't seen them this good and I'll
talk about what I mean by that it's
because I think they have the same guy
so this guy uh David
plof he appears to be the main character
behind the uh Harris campaign at the
moment and he was an Obama guy so it
looks like maybe some of the Obama
magic comes from or learned from or
picked up from maybe he was the
instigator maybe he just learned it I
don't know but the strongest persuasion
game we'd seen until Trump was Obama and
it looks like his persuasion wizard is
what's behind uh what we're
watching now how good is he let me give
you an example of how good he
is do you remember the videos in which
KL Harris said that young people are
stupid and she makes like a she makes it
a punchline so she really pushes the
stupid part she say young people want
this or that then she says you know what
young people are they're
stupid now she's completely right about
that I'm not going to argue with the
point yes every one of us is smarter
than we were when we were in college or
that age right we're all smarter than we
were at 18 if you're older than 18 if
you're 19 you're smarter than than you
when you were 18 right so it's not
really an insult to young people to say
young people are stupid because the
young people are being compared to their
own to themselves you know if I say a
20-year-old is stupid I'm comparing them
to themselves at age 50 it's not even
going to be close everybody knows that
so I agree with her the young people are
stupid but imagine that she said that
you know out loud and laughed at it and
that she's uh she's zooming ahead in the
persuasion of the young people people
because she has good memes on social
media all it took was good Tik Tock
memes and she got the young after
calling them stupid so she calls them
stupid and then without any policies
whatsoever she just makes some good
memes and brings some joy and then all
the persuaders say that she's the one
who can protect you from the evil of
trump and the next thing you know she's
winning she's winning hard the young
people boy was she about how
stupid they
are they they don't even know her
policies that if you stop a young person
and ask them two questions about
politics they won't know anything you
know it would be the rarest person who
can even answer a basic question about
either candidate they would only know
the
hoaxes
so how good a Persuader do you need to
be to get all the dumbest people on your
side even though they've been called the
dumb people by the person they're
backing though you got to be pretty good
and apparently it's pretty good now it
helps that the entire media is in the
bag for the Democrats now can give me a
fact Jack I saw somebody on social media
I didn't see every minute of Kennedy's
speech but did he say that the media is
an organ of the Democrats and that the
media and the Democrat Party are
basically
one I think he did say that right
and uh I saw a comment here on social
media saying uh do you think that the
media will fact check Kennedy on his
accusation that they are in League with
the
Democrats you think that would be pretty
important right of course they would
right because that's like one of the
main big stories of the day is that a
presidential candidate said that the
news is working hand and glove with one
party I can't think of a bigger story
than that that's just such a big
accusation so are you seeing all the uh
all the news talking about that this
morning no do you know why you won't see
that in the
news because the news is an organ of the
Democrat
Party if I hadn't brought that up before
so it's kind of amazing to watch it now
how many young people would know what I
just said that first of all the media is
essentially just the Democrat Party and
that uh it's a persuasion game and the
policies aren't even part of the process
how many young people could even just
say that most obvious clearly
transparent inarguable Point none
basically
none and they're they're sporting Harris
all right now did you wonder why why
there were so many hoaxes at the DNC
that every speaker got up there and said
fine people hoax and the the drinking
bleach hoax and one hoax and the and the
suckers and losers hoax did it seem to
you like wait a minute it's like the
media isn't even factchecking them and
they weren't I don't think a single one
of their hoaxes except for the project
2025 I think Daniel Dale did call that
out as a hoax
do you know why that one was safe to
call out as a
hoax because it's the only one that even
when you know it's a hoax if you're a
Democrat that doesn't make make much
difference because if you say well okay
Trump is not the author of it but it's
all these Trump supporters are the
author of
it
well it's just not that much difference
if you're a Democrat if you're a
republican you say well Trump's going to
do his own thing and he's not going to
do that document which is what I believe
but if you're a Democrat it's actually a
pretty strong case that a whole bunch of
Republicans that were very Pro Trump
have some suggestions that you don't
like you know because you could imagine
that could bleed over into the actual
policy I don't think it will but you
could imagine it would so that's the
only one that gets fact
checked because the fact check doesn't
move the the dial at
all imagine if Daniel Dale had fact
checked the drinking bleach the fine
people and the uh the losers and suckers
thing imagine if he just said they
weren't
true it's like the main messages of the
whole
thing we'll see that the only one he'll
debunk is the one that doesn't matter if
it's debunked or not because the
Democrats will feel the same about it if
it's technically debunked because it's
just technically debunked it's basically
directionally true they would
say so the fake fact checking is fake uh
but on top of that once you know that
this David plof guy is the wizard behind
the
throne yeah it feels reasonable to
assume that it's intentional that
they're pushing extra hoaxes why would
they do that what why would the
Democrats go really heavy on the
hoaxes it's
because here can't
compete on policy even
smes I won't say even smires I always
giv
maranes um the benefit of being an
independent mind even though he works
for CNN sometimes um he does seem
independent so I'm GNA I'm going to give
him full respect for that
um it's exactly what it looks like the
Democrats have decided they can keep the
Republicans busy debunking things and
then they won't be talking about policy
and if you could make people think about
the hoaxes they're thinking less about
policy so every hoax you see is like a
UFO sighting diversion from policy
because Harris can't work on it so just
know that that's the the play now is
that ethical of course not is it moral
of course not is it a really good
effective strategy
yeah yeah it is yep freaking David ploof
he has the goods right he he's he has
the goods I hate to say it but you
should not be don't feel comfortable
about anything no matter how no matter
even if the polls turn prot Trump do not
get comfortable there is a persuasion
wizard behind the scenes who is way more
powerful than you think
think anyway uh Governor yunan uh in
Virginia says his administration has
removed uh about 880,000 dead voters
from the state's voter roles what 80,000
dead people still on the voter
roles um and more than 6,000
non-citizens what there were 6,000
people who could have gotten away with
voting in the state they didn't live in
this raises many
questions why does the governor waste
his
time fixing an election system that was
Flawless to begin with Governor yunan
couldn't you do something useful I'm
pretty sure that the mainstream press
which is an organ of the Democrat Party
told me many many many times that these
elections are so pristine and clean that
there's no way anything could have gone
wrong this was these were clean
elections my people so he's wasting his
time getting rid of all these ineligible
voters for what it was already
Perfect all right well but that was a
oneoff I mean you know a rare
situation let it go it's it's just a
oneoff oh maybe two off uh the Ohio
Secretary of
State um they're going to prosecute
uh I guess they had found the 597
noncitizens voted in
Ohio H so he's going to refer n 597
people for possible
prosecution
huh 138 non-citizens were found to have
illegally cast ballots while another 459
registered to vote but did not actually
vote huh
why why would you need to correct
something that was already perfect again
none of it makes sense I mean I feel
like I've seen maybe a dozen stories
just this month of states that made
major changes in their election process
but why but why oh oh let me check the
fake news uh fake news let's see why
would all these changes be
necessary uh voter suppression
because the thing that the uh those
Republicans love they love voter
suppression one of the things they like
to suppress is the votes of dead people
and the votes of people who don't live
in that state and the votes of people
who are non-citizens that's called voter
suppression people obviously Trump is
trying to steal your
democracy I mean you know connect the
dots I'll say it again in case you're
slow Trump doesn't want non-citizens
voting he doesn't want people who are
from the wrong State voting he doesn't
want dead people
voting it's kind of
racist against dead people and people
who don't live in your state and
non-citizens all
right um there's a video of Gavin Nome
in some podcast uh must have been a
friendly podcast in which he was asked
about the process for comml Harris you
know being uh kind of quickly pushed to
the top of the ticket and even uh even
Nome mocked the openness of the
system Gavin Nome laughed out loud and
mocked his own party for their lack of
transparency and for basically a
non-democratic
process and then after he realized that
he was being recorded I think like I
think that was just his honest reaction
and you could imagine why I mean he if
they' had an actual contest to see who
was going to be their new leader Nome
had a really really strong chance of
being the candidate which he would know
and so even
Nome is looking like he's about five
minutes away from registering as a
republican now I don't quite mean
that or do
I you know what pushed RFK Jr over the L
it was being denied the Democratic
process that's what that's what took a
Kenedy to join forces with a republican
a Kennedy because his Democratic process
was stolen from him right in front of
the world what happened to
Nome the Democratic
process was stolen from him right in
front of the
world if you tell me there's no chance
he could to become a republican you're
wrong it would be wildly unlikely I'll
give you that but you know what else he
said recently somebody asked him on a
podcast why was the homeless problem so
bad in California do you know what he
said because of our
policies and he he didn't misspeak he
said yeah our
policies that's what got us all the
homeless what
I mean just think about that so Nome
gets totally nuked by his own party and
then he throws his party into the bus by
saying that their their policies are
what cause the problem now of course
it's in the context of changing the
policies so it' be less problem
but I don't know I think he sees what we
see maybe maybe he'll become a supporter
who knows highly
unlikely all right here's fun thing
apparently uh Kennedy was suing the
Biden Administration over their
censorship of
him um and there there was some other
case had to be resolved in some way
before his case could be looked at
seriously I can't get into the legal
details because I don't understand but
the bottom line is that he has an active
still active case quote the court finds
that Kennedy is likely to
succeed likely to succeed which is a you
know a requirement of a case going
forward that you know there's some
validity to it so the court finds that
Kennedy is likely to succeed on his
claim the suppression of content posted
in other words censorship was caused by
action of the government defendants in
other words that the Biden
Administration censored and there is a
substantial risk that he will suffer
suffer similar injury in the near
future
wow so on top of the fact that that the
evidence does suggest that it happened
you know not in a court proven way yet
but enough for something to go forward
but on top of that the court
acknowledges that they there's nothing
to stop them from doing it again and
injuring Kennedy
again what this is
amazing that that's going to go forward
because think about just the disclosure
that that would cause so the I'm not too
interested in the ultimate you know come
of the case what I'm very interested in
is whether it changes the narrative as
people understand it because I don't
think there's a single Democrat who
knows that they were censoring things
except the ones who have already
switched parties like you know Brett
Weinstein so the ones who know that
their party no longer approves of free
speech have probably already left the
party who's going to stay for
that if you actually understood that
your party was massively against free
speech and had acted in in huge in huge
ways like just thousands literally
thousands thousands of people associated
with the government working on censoring
speech mostly on one side if you knew
that could you stay in that party I
don't know how you could unless you were
blackmailed well you know when Peter
teal um said Joe Rogan show that his
feeling about how the country really
runs is the people with the most power
had to be black mailable or nobody would
let them have power in the first place
that the real power wants to make sure
that the politicians are black mailable
short of that they don't want them in
office because they can't control them
is that an
exaggeration I don't
know might not
be all right
um wait I have to look at this
joke I was applying for oh somebody said
I was applying for Australian
citizenship and the interviewer asked do
you have a criminal record I said no is
that still
required okay that's
funny trying to get into
Australia well here's the latest fake
news from Jake Tapper so apparently
Trump said said uh quote recently Trump
said uh we had a bordar who was the
bordar she loved the title but she
didn't want to do the work because she's
lazy and probably more importantly than
being lazy she wants to have an open
border and then Jake Tapper had Susan
Rice on and he said uh that it was a
racist Trope about African-Americans
that they're
lazy is
it well and when was a child in the
1960s that was definitely a racist Trope
that black people were
lazy is it
today I I I would think it's not even
close to a Trope
today because what's the difference
between 60s and now you got a black
president clearly a hard worker you got
Kobe Bryant famous for being like one of
the hardest working athletes you got
Michael Jordan one of the hardest
working athletes you got Oprah one of
the hardest working you know women
you've ever seen you've got I I could go
on all all the athletes all the
musicians Kanye Kanye no matter what you
say about him he's a hardworking
freaking guy Jay-Z hardworking uh
Beyonce hardworking except she was too
lazy to go to the DNC no I'm just joking
she was never supposed to be
there but I would I feel like Jake
Tapper had to go back to the six s to
find something to about
Trump how about you don't go back to the
60s it's not a Trope
today I've never even heard it in 30
years not not a suggestion of it
nothing and here's here's what I would
like to suggest for the millionth time
how about we treat people like
individuals Trump
did when Trump calls somebody lazy you
know I think it was a throwaway line he
could have said about anybody but I
don't even think there's any slightest
chance he had any
racial you know subconscious or
conscious thoughts about it I think it
was purely a thing you say about
somebody who was supposed to do a thing
and they didn't do a thing you know you
just speculate why it was and let people
figure it out themselves and nobody
thinks that KL Harris is lazy it's just
a political thing to
say all right so let's stop uh Jake
Tapper maybe you should stop treating
people like their groups and averages
and 60s tropes how about we treat each
other like we're all
individuals we're all individuals and by
the way if I had been the if I had been
the borders are and if I had gotten as
little done now you could argue whether
she was really a borders are but that's
separate um and I'd gotten as little
done and somebody called me
lazy I wouldn't like it
but I wouldn't say it was a racist I
would say that oh that's something
individually targeted at me because I
didn't get this thing
done so let's grow up a little
bit apparently uh KL Harris and Tim WS
are going to do some kind of a bus tour
in Georgia a bus
tour do you think I'm going to let that
go you think I'm just going to move on
it's a bus
tour come on I'm a PR professional
humorist is it a yellow
bus is it a yellow bus with
Wi-Fi because I want to see how excited
KLA is before she gets on the bus if
it's a regular bus I don't know how
excited she'd be but we've seen how
excited she gets about a yellow school
bus that has Wi-Fi if I can do my
impression of Kell Harris seeing two
different forms of transportation it
would go like this uh Miss Harris here's
your ride it's a it's an Uber it's a or
it's a let's say it's not an Uber let's
say it's a it's a limousine here's your
limousine uh thank
you no no interest in that limousine now
say um Miss Harris your ride is here
it's a it's a yellow school bus and you
can charge your phone it's got Wi-Fi
what what you what what
it's got
Wi-Fi so KLA
Harris with a yellow school
bus so yet another January
6er by the way if you're going to do
jokes about the short bus you have to do
that without
me I might laugh at them but I find
them inappropriate
and not funny
whatsoever all right
um so did you know that there's a group
of people who are active I think they're
not law enforcement but maybe working
with them that are hunting for the
identities of January 6 are still so
that once they identify somebody who was
there using their various mechanisms
then law enforcement can go pick them up
and they're still picking up people from
January 6 um and did you know that the
group of people who are helping you know
identify the Republicans to be picked
up did you know what they're
called they they have a name for
themselves apparently so this isn't me
calling them something but they have an
internal name they call themselves
Insurrection
Hunters Insurrection
Hunters do you remember in 2020 I was
mocked for saying that if Biden won
Republicans would be
hunted and then I got mocked
terribly well here we are they call
themselves hunters and they are
literally hunting
Republicans uh I was uh
somebody some idiot came who was
important I forget how uh some notable
public person came on board and mocked
me for a prediction I made
my prediction was that uh Kennedy this
was a year ago by the way so a year ago
I predicted an X that Kennedy was the
one who had determin who won the
election because he could stay in the
election if he liked how his impact was
affecting it and if he didn't like that
and wanted the other outcome he could
get out of the election so that's what
he did so I was saying you know how did
my how did my prediction age and I got
mocked by some stupid public figure I
can't remember his name who said uh that
my game that I've got a grift basically
that I make vague I make vague
predictions and then I claim victory no
matter what
happens was that a vague
prediction in 2016 when I said that uh
Trump would win was that a vague
prediction and I said he'd win because
he's the most persuasive person alive
does anybody have any doubt about that
that was pretty specific
when I when I when uh the vaccinations
were first announced and I predicted
that they wouldn't work was that a was
that a vague
prediction that's pretty specific they
won't work when I predicted that fouchi
was lying about masks um were
independent from the question of whether
they work or not I said he was lying
because he wanted to save them for the
professionals that's pretty specific
very specific
and uh when I said that Republicans
would be hunted they're literally called
Insurrection Hunters they're literally
in jail Trump got
shot I I got
cancelled dozens of other Republicans
got cancelled you don't think we got
haunted I think that's pretty
specific anyway so Ukraine has
acknowledged using bombs the US provided
inside
Russia so some people say that's
basically opening the door to World War
III because Russia will not tolerate the
US weapons being used on their territory
I could see why they would be so
displeased but may I inject a little bit
of optimism into the Ukraine
situation have you noticed that in uh in
the real world nothing gets fixed in
until it's the highest level of
emergency right when things are as bad
as they could possibly be that's when
people get serious about fixing things
until then maybe not so serious okay so
when I see that Ukraine is invading
Russia and that makes people think World
War III is coming and you know and
Putin's getting you know maybe
threatening more it looks like it's like
the end of the world but I i' like to
inject some
optimism you ready for this listen
carefully it's always the darkest before
the
dawn that's right the
situation as dire as it is is perfect
for Trump to fix it why is it perfect
because it's so
bad if something is really really really
bad it looks like World War I three is
knocking on the door suddenly if
somebody comes in and says I can fix
this everybody listens but if it's not
the end of the world and it looks like
maybe each side thinks they can get a
little more Advantage it doesn't matter
who's offering to fix it it would not
matter who is offering to fix it if they
both thought they could win some more by
keeping you know keeping it going at
this point I think it's really obvious
that there's not any winning to be had
on either side and they know it there's
no winning to be had the the
intrusion into Russia is more of a
negotiating situation to me I don't
think as as military as it is
negotiating create a little better
situation so it doesn't look like
Ukraine is doing nothing but
losing but it has created a situation
which is
ideal for Donald
Trump and so it is always the darkest
before the dawn now let me let me tell
you another thing that Trump just did
for the world suppose you're Putin and
you're thinking to yourself oh my god
I've got to you know I've got to take
this up a notch because Ukraine took it
up a notch what do you think Putin is
thinking when he knows that there's a
real good chance that uh Trump is the
one he can talk to in a few
months if you're Putin there is zero
chance you're going to launch a nuclear
war do you know why because you're
pretty sure that if you just wait for
Dawn
that you can get some kind of negotiated
end that will not humiliate you and will
not you and will allow you maybe
to have some kind of repaired
relationship in the
future Trump has
already made the odds of nuclear
war basically zero there there is no
situation in which a rational player and
Putin whether you like him or not he's
totally rational no rational player
would move nuclear between now and the
time that Trump becomes The Negotiator
nobody would it it wouldn't make any
sense how in the world could you
possibly win under that condition
there's no winning nuclear war but if
you just hold on the way things are for
a few more months you know you have
somebody you can talk to so let me say
it
again between now and the time that we
know who wins there's no chance that
Putin will go nuclear it just wouldn't
make any sense at all under any
condition it makes no sense Putin knows
that just wait Trump already made you
safe that's real that that's completely
real I don't think Putin would have gone
nuclear in any case but uh I think the
Trump possibility just makes there no
chance at all you would think about
it well there's a report that 90% of
Gaza residents have been displaced
now um as you know I don't like to take
sides um obviously it's a tragedy of
immense
proportions um but my opinion doesn't
have anything to do with what happens
over there and I think that what happens
over there is just who has the most
power gets their way the most and that's
that's all we're watching if the
Palestinians had the most power they
would have already you know taken care
of Israel in the worst possible way and
at the moment Israel has the most power
so they're you know kind of compensating
for October 7 but here's the larger
thing that I would like to point out you
know I always talk about half
opinions a half opinion is is only half
of an opinion a half opinion is we need
to spend a trillion dollars to fix
climate
change what's left out is where are you
going to get a trillion
is it worth it to run up the de Deb
another trillion so a half pinion is
when you look at either the costs or the
benefits of something but not both of
them and of course it's fully irrational
because any decision should look at both
the costs and the benefits and if your
policy is only half of that talking
about the costs or talking about only
the benefits that's a half pinion how
dangerous is a half
pinion well here's the best example
you'll ever see
the half pinion of the Palestinians as I
understand it I'll take a fact check if
I'm wrong about this is that they
overwhelmingly backed the October 7th
attack does anybody have a fact check on
that now I'm not sure that's true but
what I see every time I see interviews
of actual Palestinians they seem to be
backing October 7th am I wrong if I'm
wrong I'll change my opinion immediately
because I might be but everything I've
seen suggests
that the Palestinians were fully in
favor of October 7th do you know what
that
is that's a half opinion the half
opinion is us you know them uh attacking
uh or their people the people they like
attacking Israel is half of the equation
so they're really really happy with the
half the half that happened after that
was 90% of Gaza residents being
displaced and by the way this would be a
reasonable time to give some compliments
to whoever is keeping those displaced
people fed because that's got to be a
monstrously big job in the hardest
possible conditions and although there
were many risks of you know famine and
um
starvation I think the worst of it has
been
avoided so I don't you know I may be
wrong maybe there's more starvation
going on and of course it's tragic and
it's a war Zone and it's horrible so let
let me not if if you think I'm
underplaying the tragedy of Gaza I'm not
it looks like the worst thing I've ever
seen
lately uh which is not taking sides I'm
just you know describing it's a bad
situation there so I think this is the
danger of a half opinion you had an
entire um population who was convinced
that they do the half of it that somehow
they'd come out okay the other half is
that Israel and Anil Ates your entire
country 90% of it's already
gone and the other 10% will go I mean
there there's no there's no chance it
will ever be you know Gaza like it was
it'll always be a Israeli controlled
entity of some
kind so half pinions in America are just
as dangerous and by the way both Trump
and com Harris have plenty of half
pinions Trump wants to lower your taxes
but he hasn't told you how he's going to
deal with the deficit that's the other
part right now I get that nobody likes
higher taxes and you know if you can
increase growth that might help but it's
not going to help enough to pay down the
the deficit I don't think anybody
believes that so beware the half pinions
they will cause you to be 90% displaced
from your
[Music]
home the guardian
publication had a headline I loved never
take health tips from the world's oldest
people say
scientists yes you don't want to find
out what the oldest people did and then
copy them because you so often find out
well I ate Candy every day and smoke 10
cigarettes and you'll be like really
maybe I'll try that well it turns out
that whatever it is that makes people
live a long time it might be luck it
might be just jeans and turns out that
if you have the right luck and the right
jeans you can do a lot of things wrong
and still live pretty to a long life so
don't just look at old people to figure
out what they did it's not going to tell
you
enough and then I'm going to close on my
favorite Story the US Navy has run out a
pants I I I feel like I don't need to
talk about
that it's just funny that the Navy ran
out of pants
Where Do We
Begin if I were in if I were in some
other branch of the military which I'm
not I would be tempted to say well maybe
they don't need pants as much you know
what I mean but I wouldn't say that
because I respect all branches of the
military uh but if I were in one of
those disrespecting other branches who
has fun with each
other I might say something like
that uh
but I'll tell you what it tells me it's
like we can't have our robot dogs fast
enough because you know what a robot dog
doesn't need pants needs no
pants
