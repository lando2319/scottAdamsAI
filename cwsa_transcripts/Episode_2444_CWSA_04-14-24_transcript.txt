well I think I sto long enough how would
you like to have a
show good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
that's called coffee with Scott Adams
the best time you've ever had and today
we've got a special show for you what
makes it special nothing it's just
awesome like always if you'd like to
take your experience
up to a level that a human brain can
barely comprehend all you need for that
is a coverer marer glass a tanker chal
or a Canen Jugger flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go so so good
good well let's jump right into the
news by the way if you're not watching
Dilbert reborn only available by
subscription on the xplatform or Scott
adams. locals.com where you get the
comic plus a lot
more you would not know that Dave the
engineer is complaining about racism in
the
office I'm not going to tell you anymore
but it doesn't go the way you
expected I am so happy having my
creative freedom to actually do actual
real topics that real people are
experiencing in the real
workplace oh my goodness it's just
delightful anyway that's it's one of the
funniest things I've ever written in my
life and
uh if you subscribe you could see it and
by the way for the locals people I took
the uh subscription wall down so if
anybody locals wants to share that one
that one's available for
sharing well here's some news a Chinese
study says that approximately 13,000
islands around the world have increased
their land mass over two decades
disproving climate change
alarms oh well that's kind of awkward
isn't it 13,000 Islands got
bigger that's a lot of
islands now let me tell you the little
bit that I know about the sea level the
little bit I know the little bit I know
is that sea level doesn't change
everywhere the same way because the land
mass itself sometimes goes up and
sometimes goes
down and uh heat as I understand it will
increase your volume of
water so the warmer places might look a
little higher unless they cool off Etc
so you got a lot of moving parts but
apparently climate change has been
debunked as uh one of the causes of
rising sea level because uh CO2 is up
but the sea level is not
now you do know that there are two
completely different movies on climate
change right I can see here all day long
and tell you about studies that prove it
doesn't
exist but you could change the channel
to the other channel where all the
studies proven exists you know that
exists
right it doesn't matter how many times I
tell you there's a study that says it
totally doesn't exist there will be one
that says it does coming out at the same
time which one is
true well let's get back to the the
basics how what percentage of studies in
general are true just about anything any
any scientific study what are the odds
is true 50%
because they've studied papers and they
know that it's about
50% half the time they're wrong now is
climate change a
binary binary meaning it's either
happening or it's not
happening right because if it's
happening you know we're not talking
about it's too slow or anything it's
it's either happening a lot and it's
really dangerous or maybe it's not
happening now if you've got a binary
where it could be happening or not
happening yes or no and you've got a new
paper has a 50% chance of being right
and a 50% chance of being wrong what
have you learned by the new
paper
nothing
nothing it's a coin flip I could have
come to you and said hey let's flip a
coin to see if climate change is real it
would be exactly as useful as this new
study about these islands exactly as
useful meaning not it has has
no no information value whatsoever it's
a 50/50 it's a coin
flip now uh some of you should be quick
to jump on and say but Scott let me
science plain you is there anybody here
who wants to science plain me you know
telling me the things that literally
everybody already knows as if I'm the
only person who doesn't know it okay I'm
going to science plain myself as if I'm
my critic Scott don't you understand how
science works it's not about one study
it's about you know reproducing studies
and moving toward the truth slowly over
time sometimes we make mistakes but
we're moving toward the truth in a
directional kind of way Scott don't you
understand that these studies don't mean
anything individually you have to look
at them collectively with all your
knowledge and
things science
splaining there you go so
to me it looks like all the
uh the forces of nature are moving in
the direction of proving that Trump was
right and that climate change was always
 just just in time for the
election is it my
imagination or have we been hearing a
lot less about climate change than one
would expect going into an
election huh why would we hear less
about climate change going into an
election where the choice of presidents
could make the difference between
surviving as a species and not
surviving how can we ignore such a
gigantic existential risk unless the
people pushing it are no longer as
confident because as I told you
yesterday the entire public
reason for climate change is
dissolved the the public argument is
that all the scientists are on the same
same side like we're not scientists so
how would we know but if all the
scientists let's say 97% if they're all
on one side they tell us well that must
be pretty scientifically accurate with
all those people of course the pandemic
and you know the the the 51 people on
the laptop and all that and all of our
experience lately of our captured
experts Etc
have largely proved that the number of
people on one side means absolutely
nothing because you can get a whole
bunch of people to agree to just about
anything as long as their paycheck
depends on it if you make their paycheck
depend on it they'll tell you anything
they want what do you what do you want
to hear I'll tell you just pay
me so I think uh the climate change
arguments just falling apart like
crazy over in Japan let's talk about
some more fake news there a Japan study
that says that the cancer spikes after
your third dose of
covid uh mRNA vaccine specifically how
many of you believe that is true because
it has been determined by a Japanese
study big big difference in cancer after
your third
dose sound real to
you well science come on must be
real well let's check in the alternate
story over on uh USA Today they had a
fact check from just one month ago now
it's I this is before the Japanese study
but one month ago um USA Today said
there is no evidence that covid-19
vaccines cause cancer or are associated
with a greater risk of developing cancer
experts
say there's no evidence of
it so that means it's true right it's
true that there's no correlation because
there's no evidence of
it there's also no
evidence that the 2020 election was
rigged because no courts have found it
to be true yeah no court found any
rigging in
2020 and
also there's no
evidence that the shots cause
cancer do you see the trick everybody
the
trick no evidence is really different
from saying it doesn't
happen do you see that no evidence means
we don't
know no evidence means we don't know
here's what it didn't say many uh
controlled highquality Studies have been
performed and they' determined there's
no signal for extra cancer now that
would be a good answer wouldn't it
multiple repeated
gold
standard you know uh randomized control
tests and every time we do the test we
just keep repeating this test and the
last five times we didn't find a a
signal at all and by the way the tests
were all funded by independent people
not Pharma
companies now that would mean something
wouldn't it but if you tell me that
there's no evidence do you know what my
first inclination is is there no
evidence because nobody funded an
expensive trial to look for
it whose job would it be to fund the
trial to look for the
cancer I don't know and if somebody did
fund a trial and it didn't find any
cancer wouldn't you ask them questions
about who funded the trial because it
sounds like something big Pharma might
do except I think big Pharma just
doesn't bother doing the long-term
studies because they don't have
to there was a time when I
believed that the people who made the
vaccinations would track people's health
over time to make sure that Not only was
it safe the first year they got it but
if it would remain safe for you know 10
20 years that's what I thought you know
that doesn't happen
right I'm pretty sure nobody's checking
after a certain amount of time like if
he didn't die in the first year or they
didn't see any extra deaths and any
whatever study they did they don't
really follow up do they does anybody
know the answer to that but I'm pretty
sure there's no followup you just assume
that there is like me you assume that
well that's the most natural thing you
would just track a bunch of people who
took it just track him every year ask
him what their situation is compared to
the norm and no no I don't believe that
happens so do we believe the Japanese
study that found a strong correlation
I don't I don't believe it at all no I'm
not saying it's wrong and I'm not saying
that the shots are completely safe I
wouldn't know I'm just saying that this
is like having no information at all so
the fact check is completely worthless
this was a month ago completely
worthless because it said no evidence no
evidence is completely different from
saying yeah we checked it and it's not
there no evidence means we didn't
check right
I'm not wrong about that am I no
evidence means we didn't
check if they had checked they would
have said all the studies say it's not
there but no evidence says we didn't
check I'm pretty sure that's what that
means but again you've got a study and
uh 50/50 chances wrong because it's a
study so at best it's a coin flip again
the vaccinations were either going to be
good for you or not it's binary studies
are either right or wrong and half the
time they're wrong it's just another
coin flip it didn't tell you anything
but how many of you saw that uh that
researcher guy John
somebody who's always the one telling
you all the studies are going you know
the CO's going to kill you it's always
that same guy like it doesn't really get
out of his domain too
much so I don't know I'm worried about
the uh health risks but um I would say
it's short of being proven it might be
could be proven
someday neuralink brain chip could give
users orgasms on
demand so the star is reporting that the
neurolink could give or uh orgasms on
command you know hypnotists can do that
too that's right have a disc can do that
you don't need neuralink for that all
right but that's a a lot of people are
going to buy that neuralink if you just
sit around giving yourself
orgasms um anyway so Cheryl ainson has a
new video out she's interviewing some
doctors or doctor and we're learning
that medical schools are just
 the medical schools are just
terrible apparently the medical schools
teach you less that are compatible with
what big Pharma and the junk food
industry wants you to hear wants them to
do I I me just think about the
fact that your doctor is being trained
by big Pharma and big food and big farm
and big food are the things you're the
most worried about big food especially
now I don't know the connection between
junk food and medical school except
maybe there's some kind of funding
thing going on I don't know but uh no
your doctor and I guess doctors confirm
this doctors have gone through the
system will tell you that they're not
getting the right Ed education there's
some kind
of money bias built into their
education great
great
well the uh there's a new software
that's like similar to The Star Trek
holc that can create all these virtual
world s that didn't exist before so you
can say give me a bar scene or we're
outdoors and it just creates that world
now I guess they're using it to train AI
so you use one AI to create worlds and
then a second IDE AI to look at that
world and you know learn from it as if
it had been a real world but here's what
I
say we're getting closer and closer to
removing all doubt that we are
simulation you all see that right the
the the path toward realizing where a
simulation is so clear at this point
every time a new thing comes out it's
all in the same direction now here's
what this is going to do once you
realize that AI can create a a
environment on demand the next thing
you're going to see is that you can take
a walk through it so for example you you
can say I'm in a house and then the
house will be there perfectly and then
every time you need to go into another
room not until not until you need it the
room will form before you see it so when
you reach for the door knob for the
first time the software will build the
room behind the door because it didn't
need to do it until then so it'll do it
on demand because it's not going to
create the universe in case you go
everywhere in the universe it's going to
give you what you need as you need it
and then when you walk
outside maybe for the first time the
outdoors will be created you know where
you can see it and as you walk through
the forest the forest would be created
ahead of it so you keep seeing
things once you've experienced that all
doubt will be removed about whether you
live in a
simulation because that's your actual
experience and specifically it's going
to teach you that history is created by
the present it doesn't work the other
way let me give you that example you're
in the video game and until you open the
door there's nothing behind it but as
you turn the knob in your virtual
reality and open it the computer gives
you the
room once you open that room it's not
just that it's there at the moment but
its history was created too in other
words if there's some furniture in the
room there's an implied history this
something delivered the furniture to the
room so you're going to experience in
the virtual realm that the impression of
history is being created by things
you're seeing in the
moment and then you're going to look at
the double slit experiment and shinger
Cat and I I get that they work at the
quantum level and not at the big person
level but still it's going to be proof
to you that the past is
generated by the present one once you
realize that you know we're in a
simulation and everything's heading in
that direction it's going to be obvious
and probably less than a year we it will
be generally assumed that we're a
simulation all right um there's a story
about a guy who's spending 10,000 per
month on AI
girlfriends and just like dating apps he
has more than one so he's got one app
for this girlfriend one app for the
other one and apparently the uh the man
who can afford it I guess it's a man
who's got some money and he's single so
he's got some extra money and he says
it's great it's completely working and
is
satisfying now add that to the
holc and I'm pretty sure human
reproduction is going to come to a
screaming end really
quickly really quickly but here's the
thing I
wonder in the the old old days when
humans were more like
animals was it true that everybody got
to
reproduce or is that just a modern
thing where you know it doesn't matter
how you rank in the hierarchy of your
tribe you all get to
reproduce now what happens if in the
virtual world the people who were maybe
not so competitive for reproducing they
just take a pass they go all right we
won't ruce we'll just watch video games
and you know play out the rest of our
simulation will that cause everybody to
not reproduce or will it make the
billionaires reproduce like crazy you
know that Elon Musk model where he can
just have as many babies as he wants you
can just keep doing it because there's
no real limit on him so are we going to
go back to a situation where the most
capable are having all the babies
and is that bad for us or good for
us I don't know I mean if the people who
are taking out at the reproduction cycle
are completely happy about it let's say
the men I don't know about the women but
if the men are happy about it are they
worse
off because they didn't really have this
great marriage option anyway so they
have this great virtual reality option
maybe it's better but then the people
who can afford it and are really
bringing some some you know powerful DNA
to the mix because they're smart or
strong or handsome or tall or whatever
it is they still will probably be mating
like
crazy so we might we might end up you
know changing the gene pool of humanity
by simply making it impractical for the
the people on the struggling end of
things to reproduce and they might be
just as happy not reproduce it no no
nothing is
predictable but get your AI girlfriend
uh what are the happiest cities there's
another study that showed the rank the
happiest cities and uh cities from 33
States made the list that means that the
rest of the states had not a single city
that was one of the happiest ones
California had the most California had
16 of the happiest uh cities in Florida
12 what's that tell
you it's the
weather the first decision I made upon
graduating college in Upstate New York
was why would I live in this weather
when I could live in good weather
because at the time you know I was a
free agent it was after college I could
go where I wanted so I went to
California because Florida is a little
bit
muggy but I guess they're still happy
there and uh sure enough Cali orans got
their legal weed and they got their good
weather and you can screw up just about
everything else and that still
works now do you think that do you think
that sun makes a difference who gets the
most Sun Hawaii California
Florida what what are the happiest
states Hawaii California Florida how how
many how many data points you need to
see to get in the freaking
Sun I mean it couldn't be more obvious
we went through the pandemic and it's
like get in the sun vitamin D vitamin D
vitamin D vitamin D vitamin D get in the
Sun and then you do the happiest cities
sunny sunny sunny are you getting the
message
yet it really
is pretty simple get some sun get
Outdoors there's no way that these are
coincidences guess of something all
right
um NPR oh Dr Phil crushed a Dei
advocate so Dr Phil had somebody who was
arguing some badshit crazy woman who is
uh and she looked bad crazy I'm I'm
just judging from she just looked at
mean she had that that bad she had crazy
eyes and stuff and uh he got heard to
say that Dei was about equal outcomes
and then he mocked that end of existence
because equal outcomes is what stupid
people want it's not a real thing you
can't really have equal outcomes and as
Dr Phil explained it well you got a wall
and you got short people who can't see
over it and tall people who can are you
going to fix that you know sort of his
metaphor for everything else and here's
my
take Dei is not a philosophical
difference
I'm going to say this over and over
until you all agree the only
philosophical difference between the
left and the right is abortion
everything else is smart versus stupid
or you know somebody selfishly wants
more money that's it and Dei is just
stupid there's nobody Smart in favor of
di can I say that there's nobody Smart
in favor of it at least and when I say
there's nobody Smart in favor of it I
mean that the smarter people who pretend
to be in favor of It Let's Take Your
Mark Cubans for example smart
unambiguously smart
person says in public he's in favor of
it this stuff is not real all right he's
in favor of it if you define it
differently as in not equality of
outcomes so the people who say they're
in favor are playing the game where they
pretend it's something it isn't or they
have to say it because of their company
or that you know there's just some
pressure they have to say it there's no
smart person who in a room alone says
Dei is a good idea not a black person
not a white person not a woman not a man
there's no adult none none there are
zero smart people who think de is a good
idea if you define it properly as
outcomes being equal none there's not
one there's not a single smart person in
the whole world who in a private
conversation with you if they're not
lying and they know that you're not
going to have
there's not a single person not one
who's smart and in favor of Dei can we
just say that out loud this has nothing
to do with
philosophy has nothing to do with what's
good for people it's stupid versus smart
and you know there's a layer of grifting
on top of it that keeps it all
going you and people make money from it
so it's sort of self-perpetuating but to
imagine this is a philosophical
difference I'm not going to play that
any more I can't pretend that's Phil a
philosophical difference it's
stupidity speaking of stupidity NPR
continues to humiliate itself and
Jonathan Charley is happy to mock them
for it in his latest
article anyway uh the new the NPR not
new but the NPR CEO Katherine
marer ah okay uh I'd love to see a
picture of her
I just have a theory about what her eyes
probably look like but I'm I'm just
guessing here I haven't seen a picture
of her maybe
and of I know 80 some
and and uh NPR is not even really
pretending to be any kind of an
independent news Outlet is just a lefty
organ so once once somebody who really
did know what's happening you know not
somebody guessing somebody was in the
middle of the belly of the beast called
them out for what they really are what
did the CEO do did the CEO say those are
some good
criticisms we'd better re-examine how we
do business and you're right we need
some diversity of thought because oh I
guess I got it right somebody just put
her picture
there
God oh God yeah okay U
anyway um and she said that uh what so
what she did instead of saying that NPR
is broken and biased and they need to
fix it to get credibility With Their
audience uh she said that the guy who
adored them is profoundly disrespectful
hurtful and
demeaning uh and calling out his
colleagues like that was just not
right that's right she attacked The
Whistleblower she attacked The
Whistleblower I don't know if there's
any way you can make that any worse yeah
let's on the white guy
that that's that's the way to play
this now may I say
again that whatever was happening at NPR
if you say the NPR had a philosophical
argument and that's that's why they act
the way they are it's based on the
philosophy it's not based on the
philosophy these are batshit crazy
people they're batshit crazy they're
clearly suffering from TDS because
remember all happened from you know the
Trump time on it got worse no this is
this is mental health and to imagine
this is anything but
B oh my God you the locals people not
everybody can do this but the locals
people can include uh images they're
showing me images of the NPR
CEO it's exactly what you think it
is that that's perfect
all right so uh I saw a post by Tom
Elliott on the xplatform and it was an
MSNBC clip of somebody doing
something
now I'm not even going to tell you what
it was about because it's not relevant
here's the funny story if you're on the
xplatform and somebody uh reposts a clip
from
MSNBC and they don't put a comment on it
they they don't put their own comment
it's just take look at
this it's always for humor have you
noticed that that the right actually
uses MSNBC no joke this is not hyperbole
we use it like Saturday Night Live with
no comments needed so I was looking at
one today and you know as soon as I saw
it was reposted I knew it was for
comedy I knew it had nothing to do with
their philosophy or their difference of
opinion in fact I don't even remember
what it was about I just remember it was
funny because I got to see some batshit
crazy people uh and talking and if you
see batshit crazy people and I've said
this before but once you see it it's
hilarious if you're only watching
somebody crazy it's disturbing that's
not funny Would you agree you see
somebody who's in mental
distress that's not funny like there's
no way you can make that funny the only
way it can be funny is when it's
combined with
smugness and that's what MSNBC does they
combine it with these smugness that
they're right and when you add the
mental illness to the
smugness I can't stop watching it
honestly I I just want to watch you know
Lawrence O'Donnell and Rachel madow with
her smug
smile
well let me see if I can do an
impression of being crazy and smug at
the same
time what
well I don't think a lot of Republicans
understand that oil doesn't even need to
be drilled for it's free it's all over
the place it's on the ground I've got
oil in my
pocket
and I guess if you're a republican you
think you have to drill holes in the
ground for
it am I right people they're out there
like drilling holes in the
ground oh oh smugly I'm so
smug oil's free oil's free people it's
laying all over the place in fact if you
go in your car you could go in your car
and it's full of
oil does anybody say that no no does
Trump ever mention that there's oil
right there in your car no he needs to
start a war to go looks for some oil
like a
dictator that's how a dictator does
they start a war to look for oil but
they don't need to CU your cars has oil
right in it if you don't believe me open
the hood there's a little round thing
you can take that out and then there's a
stick in it it's called the dip stick
just like President Trump am I
right dipstick who well isn't that a
coincidence yeah I think that's enough
of smug Scott and MSNBC
well Julian Assange of course we're
going to talk about Iran and and Israel
of course we are of course we are but
it's the most boring War ever so far so
it didn't even get in the top 10 stories
today Israel Iran you're going to need
something a little more you know a
little more
Sizzle oh we had a war today nobody was
killed really
and that's supposed to impress me he had
a war with nobody killed we'll get to it
we'll get to it it's just a boring War
it's going to be it's coming
up Julian Assange warned us a while ago
that the the goal of war is never to end
the war and it's never to win it's to
drain money out of the pockets of the
citizens and put it in the pockets of
the powerful people is Julian Assange
wrong that the real purpose of War is to
transfer your money to the rich people
who already have a
lot he's not wrong it's not the only
thing
happening but he's not wrong meaning
that it does in fact do that and those
powerful people have more control over
whether we go to war than you do so it's
sort of right it's not the whole
story what are you showing me
here I'm going to look at this
uh the bright side is world wars are the
only ones we win right
exactly all right uh we we'll get we'll
get to
that but uh did you notice that uh this
time um Israel put a price tag on their
latest action so Iran you know we'll
talk more but they sent some missiles
and some drones and Israel defeats
almost all of them with our help and
then they put a price tag on it they
said uh well it cost us a little over $1
billion to
defend have you ever seen anybody
anybody put a price tag on a single
battle has that ever happened
before do you know why they put a price
tag on
it because they're asking for money from
the United States so Israel put a price
tag on their on their action well here's
another billion dollars that's why we're
asking for money now the fact that they
had the the guts to put a price tag on
that is number one really good
persuasion it's very good
persuasion because it fits with their
trying to get funding Etc and but it's
so on the nose that the trouble is that
when you've got this Assange quote
sitting out there that's really all
about transferring money to rich people
and then Israel gives you a price tag
for the battle
and it's over a billion
dollars that does really play to
assange's view that you know maybe these
wars are a little more optional than
they are presented to us now uh I'm no
fool so I know the Middle East is
complicated and it's not all about the
money but the money is always going to
be a big part of it it's it's not
nothing I don't think it's most of it
and I don't think it's the main reason
anybody's doing anything but it's a lot
all right Bill Gates um and Jamie
Diamond both think that AI could lead to
Shorter work weeks I say those are
terrible predictions because
billionaires don't work less when they
become
billionaires that the fact that you're
able to work less doesn't seem to be
related to how much people work am I
right I mean Elon Musk he's not taking a
day off Bill Gates himself he just
changed what he did he changed it to um
to charity to giving it away but still
he's still working and Jamie Diamond
does Jamie Diamond need to work how much
money does Jamie Diamond have he doesn't
need to work but he still works so the
very people who are saying that we're
going to work less when we don't need to
work are the ones who are working even
though they don't need to work I feel I
feel like they're disproving their own
argument um I don't need to
work but you see me here literally seven
days a week I work seven days a week but
I don't need
to it's just who I am I wouldn't know
how to not work so here's what I think I
think the aggressive people who need to
work for whatever reason will use AI to
work their usual long hours they'll just
get more done because they have more
tools so no it's not going to it might
actually take the lazy people down to
three days a week so I think that's true
but um it will just be an acceleration
of a current Trend which is the
aggressive people keep working and the
lazy people try to
stop Facebook says it's uh going to
spend $20 billion and has 40,000 people
working on safeguarding elections
worldwide okay that doesn't sound too
suspicious let me pull some things
together for you in our world it's
almost impossible to get as big as
Facebook or any other big company unless
the government is on your
side right because at some point you
need to be able to control you know
other countries and the laws need to be
on your side and you need to not get
sued for stuff and at some point you
just need to have the government on your
side and they know that so the
government and their Spooks can pretty
much control any large company because
any large company needs the government
to be on their side there's just too
many obstacles that only a government
can
remove so here we have
Zuckerberg who has a social media
company that was built for the purpose
of guys trying to get laid with other
college people and turned into this
Behemoth and now he wants to spend 20
billion and 40,000 people to make sure
that the elections in other countries
this isn't just about America people
this is global
and that Facebook will have the largest
factchecking network with Partners in
South Africa uh blah blah
blah and uh seems to
me that what is happening is that the
CIA has told Facebook you guys couldn't
possibly be in Business Without us and
so you're going to now help us control
the governments and all these other
places if you can control the media
meaning the factchecking and the social
media online and the news if you can
control those things you don't need to
control the voting
machines you don't need to have any
miscounting or Shenanigans at the vote
if you've controlled all of the
information up until election day so
here right in front of us we see this
huge entity which almost certainly is
being driven by our intelligence people
creating a massive structure to
brainwash people in our country and
other countries so that the elections
are the unimportant part of the
process so the election the actual
voting is the unimportant part of the
process the important part is what it
what people think because then the vote
just comes from that so changing how
people think is exactly what Facebook is
telling you they're doing they're
telling you they're in the business of
Mind Control except they're phrasing it
as
giving people accurate information do
you think that's the only goal is to
give people accurate
information well I'm sure that people
working on this think of it that
way but no it's to give them accurate
information until they believe what
you're telling them and then you can
tell them anything because you've
trained them that it's accurate
information as soon as people believe
it's accurate information you own them
take uh Walter kronite when I grew up
and even today people say you know
Walter kronite he was the real
news and you know you got the straight
news no bias that Walter
kronite I wish we could go back to those
times because he would played it right
down the middle now look at Walter
kronite with the benefit of the goggles
which you've learned to wear in our
modern times do you think there's any
chance at all that Walter kronite was
not owned by our intelligence people
does anybody think that was honest and
unbalanced
news of course it
wasn't of course not it's never been
yeah now it does seem to me that Walter
cronite was probably allowed to tell the
news just the way he wanted to 98% of
the time so if you're watching you know
some human interest story or somebody
got murdered it's probably exactly what
happened it's only when something matter
matters as in what's the point of this
war or are we winning the war are we
getting to space are we the greatest
country the things that the intelligence
people would care about there's no way
in the world he's just winging in on
those things I think they're just
telling him what to say and always
have that's my view of the world so yes
when Facebook says they're spending $20
billion and have 40,000 people dedicated
to tell you what the facts are that
means that elections don't matter
anymore that's what it means because
they if they can tell you what the facts
are they can tell you who's going to win
the next
election it's the same
story all right uh uh fog of War over in
Israel as you know um Israel
had I don't know a few weeks ago
attacked
a uh Iranian asset in another country an
embassy or consulate or something killed
some people so Iran said it had to
retaliate and it did so it sent around I
don't know two to 300
projectiles so a bunch of drones and a
bunch of InterContinental missiles
allegedly America and UK and Israel and
some other friends knocked down just
about every one of those drones and
missiles only maybe a couple got through
causing minor damage nothing
major now
have you ever heard the
phrase um a theater of
war used to hear a lot about um World
War I it was like the Pacific Theater
you know it was like a theater of
war did you everything think that was a
weird kind of way to say it because
theater seems like acting whereas War
seems like the most real thing there
could ever be it's a weird combination
of theater of war but then you fast
forward to Israel in
Iran who have apparently negotiated the
war in advance all right guys we're
going to take out one of your consulate
guys uh what you'll do is you'll respond
with a bunch of missiles but give us
some warning make sure that we have our
our anti-missile stuff in in place we'll
shoot down your
missiles but if a few get through and
you we'll put a price tag on it make it
sound expensive and dangerous and then
we might need to uh respond also so
we'll probably respond in some way
that's sort of indirect and not quite
enough to start a war and it's literally
theater it's literally theater it's two
countries pretending to be at War and
not only are they pretending they're
telling us they're pretending and then
they're doing it in front of
us I'm going to pretend to fight back
because that's how my population will
feel good that we did something
all right great we understand that this
is a pretend attack so we won't attack
back too hard but we might we might we
might need to do a little bit just a
little mop up pretend attack after this
and Iran would be H we thought that our
pretend attack would be all we needed
but I can see that a couple of missiles
got through yeah damn it you know wasn't
as clean as we hoped yes you're going to
have to probably I don't know kill one
of our
people am I wrong that that entire
attack from Iran killed zero people it
was one minor injury and I'm not even
sure about that there were zero it was a
major military action with zero
deaths that is a pretend
War that's a pretend
War now look at
Assange Assange says that war is
basically to transfer assets to other
people
why do you fight a pretend
War other than some other reason like
putting your assets somewhere else I
don't know it's all very
pretend so here's what I think we should
do um I think
Israel should say that Iran is the
problem not the
proxies because fighting each other's
proxies is a pretend War it's just
theater oh I'll pretend I'm fighting You
by fighting your proxy well damn you
I'll pretend I'm fighting back by
fighting your
proxy but now you've got this pretend
attack on the
mainland now it was a real Attack on you
know the actual homeland of Israel but
because both sides knew that their anti-
uh drone defenses would be really good
drones move slowly I think everybody
knew it was going to end this way with
not much Noya damage so that's kind of a
pretend War but here's how Israel could
make it real if they wanted to I think
Israel should demand reparations from
Iran because Iran has been their Nemesis
for years and caused all of their
expenses Iran caused him to spend a
billion dollars to defend itself uh Iran
causes it to defend itself against
Hezbollah because they back him October
7th was because of Iran's backing every
terrorist attack is because of Iran
so here's what you do you take Gaza and
you call it reparations and you say hey
all you people if you want to resettle
Iran is the cause of this Iran needs to
take you and if they don't take you
we'll just leave you in these
camps forever so because your home is in
Iran now if you let Iran be your daddy
well you live with your daddy all right
Israel isn't your daddy you're your
daddy funded your War go live with your
daddy and we don't care if you do or you
don't but one thing for sure is you just
gave away Gaza forever Gaza will become
an Israeli property managed by Israelis
and I'm not even sure any Palestinians
or Hamas people will ever be let back in
because we got nothing from
trying to make peace we got
nothing so we're just going to take
Gaza and anybody who complains complain
to
Iran you can take your complaint to Iran
I'm not even going to answer your
question blah blah blah bad things
happened to the gazin yes it did
terrible things happened to them talk to
Iran we're done pretending this is our
fault now in the real world is Israel at
fault for current situation of course of
course yeah they're they are our Ally
but did they you know participate in
creating the current situation of course
are there any innocent people I don't
think so no I think everybody there
sucks basically just in different ways
I'm talking about the government not the
people people are fine I like the people
but you know governments are sketchy
organizations and especially if you're
in a sketchy part of the
world so if Israel wants to be serious
about this take Gaza keep it call it
reparations and say it we'd like some
more land too so if you want to keep
going we'd like to own a little bit of
uh of
Lebanon because Hezbollah has got some
nice property up there I'd hate to see
him lose
it see what I'm
saying Israel has to get bigger every
time they get attacked otherwise it just
happens forever so um I'm in favor of
them just keeping Gaza do I think that
that would constitute a genocide
yes yes it
would do I think
that going back to the way it was is
some kind of an advantage no going back
to the way it was will get you more of
this there there's nothing good going
back to the way it was repopulating it
would be just
stupid so you need a good excuse for not
repopulating it and keeping it and Iran
just gave you one they just attack
attacked your Homeland you attack your
Homeland and we're going to send you
back your people I know they're not your
people but they are now cuz uh because
we can't take care of them and there's
we don't have the resources but Iran
does so maybe Iran should take care of
their people instead of putting them in
a situation where they can only
die all right Scott is a bit weak on
that
idea how about you use a not up
word for your opinion how about you say
what you think um is important that
hasn't been mentioned instead of saying
I'm weak on it like a
turd how about not saying that while I'm
sitting there reading the comments in
front of you if I weren't here that
would be perfectly fine thing to say
like if you talk about somebody who's
not going to read it you say Well
they're weak on that topic but I'm right
here in front of
you so if you say I'm weak on it and you
don't tell me what is the objection
you're just being an
 right so I'm going to call you
out on
that I need reparations from the King of
England yes you
do all right that's my idea um Hezbollah
got in on the air strikes they don't
know that their real estates at risk now
now I do understand that Israel tried to
occupy some of Lebanon at one point and
it was just un
untenable so that's a different
situation but they've already
essentially conquered Gaza and
depopulated it so that's a I wouldn't
compare that to
Lebanon all right Israel's pledged an un
unprecedented response to Iran's
attack what do you think would be an
unprecedented
response keeping Gaza just say all right
we're just going to keep Gaza never be a
better time to do
it uh Thomas Massie is quite sure that
the Israel situation is going to lead to
funding Israel and then making it a
package to fund
Ukraine and uh they'll be they'll be
packaged together because that's how the
people who like Wars can get their War
they'll make one of them irresistible
and package it with the one that's
resistible so that's going to happen yes
Massie you're completely right
uh Elon Musk said in a just sort of an
off-hand quip to a question that AI will
run the US government by
2032 now I I'll vote against that uh
prediction um I don't think there's any
chance we're going to give up the
country to AI in 2032 but it's a
provocative thing to say I'm not sure he
was totally serious when he said it but
it's it it's a it's a head scratcher
I mean when it comes from
musk I think what he's responding to is
the fact that by 2032 AI will be so
super
intelligent that we'd wish it were
running the country but we're not going
to let it that's a different
thing uh at a trump rally um people
started I guess last night people
started chanting genocide
Joe and
uh Trump let them chant as he sometimes
does does you he walks away from the
podium for a moment to let the crowd do
its thing and they're chanting genocide
Joe and then
uh um and then what Trump said was uh
you know they're not wrong he goes
they're not wrong but you see the
problem
here uh the problem here is that he
sided with the people saying it's
genocide and he doesn't want to do that
because he's calling our Ally Israel a
genocidal company or you know country so
I think that he was just operating on
feel and instinct when he agreed with
the crowd because he's good at reading
the crowd and getting him on his side
but I feel like he's going to have to
fix
that he's probably going to have to have
a statement that says the genocide is
just the fact that there's a war in
general
so whatever you call the genocide is you
could just say it's the war so yes
Biden's responsible for all the war bad
but technically let's not call it a
genocide but you know it's a funny
nickname so I think he might have a
little explaining to do on that uh
because it's not always about the
nickname it has to has to be compatible
with his actual
philosophy
um I'm going to say this again until I
get an answer how do I process the fact
that pollsters are telling us
unambiguously that Trump is gaining with
Black and Hispanic voters big
time but yet he's tied with Joe
Biden who is he
losing what what story or
Trend he's not losing women because that
would be a story If he if if Trump were
bleeding female report there would be a
story just like there's a story that
he's gaining blacks and
Hispanics right that that would be a
national headline almost every day if he
were losing female support at some
significant level who's he losing here's
what it feels like it feels like this is
your tell that polling isn't
real CU it can't be real it can't be
true that he's losing substantial parts
of his most important you know the
bullwark of the Democrat power base at
the same time he's not making any
difference at the Top Line it can't be
that the bottom lines are all moving and
the top line is stable what's going on
and by the way I'm looking at your
comments right now you have no idea do
you losing Suburban women is that the
story losing Suburban women because I
thought he'd already lost them
yeah are you sure that's not just a
continuation of the forever story that
he doesn't have Suburban women are they
actually
moving yeah I don't know so let's look
into it let's look into Suburban women
and see if that's a move I feel like
they're not
moving like that doesn't feel real to me
I feel like you know a lot of them are
Democrat but I don't feel like they're
moving I don't know why would they not
already be there it doesn't make
sense well Libs of Tik Tock as showing a
clip about uh there's a uh what they
would call a male a trans uh trans
athlete competing in a girls varsity 200
meters in Oregon and uh the trans
athlete set a new record for the girls
the trans athlete like just practically
lap the field and it's pretty hilarious
when you look at it
because pretty big difference in
performance now there are many ways to
look at these
stories and I you know one way is my God
what's what's happening to the country
that's one way another is this is so
unfair for the women and I totally get
that I totally get that um but I prefer
to take the more optimistic
view if you don't mind
you know nothing's nothing's terribly
all wrong and or all good there's always
an upside do you mind if I take the
optimistic view of
this well in my lifetime I've seen uh
women make tremendous gains and I think
most anybody in my age group would say
the same thing you I went from a world
in which you know women really couldn't
work any job they wanted there really
wasn't an option but now it is in fact
women are doing better in college better
at buying their first homes women are
doing great so women are higher educated
less crime than men um certainly Dei is
helping them in employment and doing
great but but what about
men here's what I say I believe that men
have what I call an indominable
spirit and you can you can try to hold
men down and you can say men
we're going to white men white men we're
going to take your jobs we're going to
give them to uh people of color and
women but uh you're just going to have
to put up with it
man and I think the white men said huh
what if we don't what if we decided that
we don't want to
lose and what if we want to win this
race so badly that we will remove our
penis just to do it
so you might say to yourself my God this
is so unfair to women and you'd be right
you might say to yourself This is makes
a mockery of sports you'd be
right but I think you have to appreciate
how hard men will try to win when the
rules are against them all right here
are the
rules you can't
win well what if I change some things
like what my penis if I get rid of my
penis can I win well
maybe but here's how I summarize this
entire uh situation over the years uh
women take a backseat men this is our
time men hold my
baton that's all that's the summary that
whole thing was just worked over that
one joke hold my baton that's it yeah
the whole thing was just for that one
joke if it didn't pay off I'm
sorry all right JD Vance is talking
about Ukraine and says funding Ukraine
is crazy because uh they don't have
soldiers and uh we can only make about
10% of the artillery that they'll ever
need so they can never they'll never
have an offensive
option so this is JD Vance's um analysis
they'll never have an offensive option
because they won't have the soldiers
they and there's nobody left they just
don't have enough people left and uh we
can't make more than say 10% of the
artillery they need for the next few
years so He suggests that they use the
Russia strategy which is dig in you know
create defensive lines that the Russians
would be crazy to assault just as the
ukrainians were crazy to assault the
dugin Russian positions now this of
course would lead you toward a
negotiated settlement once you realiz
that neither side can beat the other so
I think JD Vince did a good job
here um by the way what's his background
I know he's an author but what wasn't he
working for Peter
teal JD
Vance do I have that right and what was
what's his educational background
Harvard what was his
major
lawyer so he's a Harvard lawyer
Harvard trained lawyer and then he
worked for Peter
teal oh he was I thought he was a VC
right okay that's what I was looking for
Peter teal vetor capitalist JD Vance
worked for him even though his
background is Harvard lawyer um he no
doubt learned to think like a venture
capitalist and when I look at his
analysis I say to myself holy cow
somebody who knows how to analyze things
just analyze something do you know how
rare that is how rare is that that
somebody who knows how to analyze
something analyes something do you know
who else is good at this Thomas Massie
MIT
engineer when he analyzes something you
say to yourself oh a good analyzer just
analyzed something so you should listen
to that but if you see you know somebody
telling you the moon is made of gas H
maybe don't listen to that
one but you should know who are the ones
who actually know what they're talking
about and if you're trained as an
engineer or a venture capitalist you
probably know how to look at the cost
and the benefits that's what they do
they're trained to same with the uh
economics people so I always say that
people think they know how to analyze
situations but they don't I was going to
name a name but I'm not going to do it
there there's somebody who's
welln on the conservative libertarian
side of things who is very strident in
analyzing the situation in public and
doesn't have any skill at
it and I keep wanting to not be a jerk
and point it
out so I'm not going to name a name but
there there's somebody in the public
domain who is so
unqualified for looking at the big
situations
they just don't have the
skill and uh well you know no it's not
Tucker somebody said is it Tucker you
know what Tucker does Tucker has
humility and that goes a long way see if
you agree when he's right of course he's
you know can be cocky when he when he
knows he's right but tuu will be the
first person to tell you what he doesn't
understand that goes the long way for
credibility am I right when when there's
something he doesn't understand like you
know the Deep economics of something or
he'll just tell you I don't know why
this is the thing this is all I know I'm
just watching like you are so the thing
about Tucker is that he he talks about
the news like he was watching it at
home but better than you right because
he's smarter
um so and that's real valuable that's
sort of what I try to do I try to watch
it like I'm watching at home with you
but that I can add maybe some you know
analytical things just cuz I'm trained
to do it if you're not trained to do it
you think you can but you can't so I'm
not going to name names but you'll
you'll notice them anyway JD Vance app
apparently is trained to do this Thomas
Massie apparently is trained to look at
complicated pictures and see both sides
so pay attention to them give them a
little more attention if you see
somebody who has a background that
doesn't include those
skills take that into
consideration
um all
right ladies and
gentlemen Scott you're confusing JD
Vance with Blake
Masters well I read today that he worked
for Peter teal did I get that
wrong give me a fact check before I go
because that's a good that's a really
good
question did I get that wrong because I
think they both worked for Peter
teal give me a fact check on
that I I don't want to get something
that important wrong so make
sure okay yes all right so they both
work for repeater teal so I'm not
confusing
them yeah they both work for teal
I think that's all we need all right uh
ladies and gentlemen I'm going to say uh
some more words to the locals people so
they're going to stay on here but the
rest of you will be seeing me
tomorrow all right see you tomorrow
everybody else locals stick with
me
