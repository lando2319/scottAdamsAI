hey everybody
so i was getting ready to do some work
as i do every day i don't know about you
but
uh i work seven days a week because i'm
not
lazy and one of the reasons i work seven
days a week is that
it spreads out my drawing time so i
don't overuse my hand on any given day
of the week
by the way this is not a bandage it's a
little device i use so that when my hand
is uh
on the glass of the screen it's not
leaving any oils from my hand
i replace these every now and then but
this one's a little worn
all right so what you're gonna see is an
intermediate
stage of drawing the dilbert cartoon so
these are the tools that i use this is a
wacom cintiq spelled w-a-c-o-m
wacom is the name of the company and
then the model
of the uh of the drawing device here
is a cintiq c i n
t i q so if you google those you can you
can see what this device is
this would be the common device used by
almost every person who draws comics for
a living at this point
so if you're not using paper you're
probably using
something exactly like this
so um this is photoshop software
and i do the entire drawing in photoshop
there's no reason that i have to use
photoshop it's just one of the ways you
could do it
i happen to be comfortable with
photoshop so i do it that way
i think you would find most people would
use
other software but for me it does
everything i want
so what you're seeing here is the stage
of the comic in which it's already
written
so the first thing i did was i uh i
wrote the words
and that was yesterday and writing the
words for a dilbert comic these days
is as easy as typing at least the the
physical part of it
you probably can't see that but let's
see if you can see
can you see this
so as you can see my own handwriting
is the font
so some years ago i just converted all
of my handwriting into
a dilbert font available only to me
you're going to say hey where can i get
that font and the answer is
my computer that's the only place that
exists
and in the cloud i suppose so if you're
a really good hacker you can get it
i've been thinking about releasing it
but i don't know
the dilbert font is only capital letters
oddly enough
because the dilbert cartoon is always
capital letters
there's no reason for that except that
it's a cartooning standard
comics tend to use all capital letters
uh
it's not a good idea but
it's it's the common way it's done so
here we see a stage in which i've taken
the
general characters and plop them in
so if you look at it you can see that
there are a bunch of uh
a bunch of screens that are kind of
incomplete
so you'll see there's no dober body here
i don't have the
the face so these are just uh
placeholders
i just take uh art i've done before plop
it in
and then i'll make a bunch of
adjustments to each of the characters
but they they kind of block out the
scene for me
i don't know if other people use this
technique or not
now here's one of the things that is
sort of really
inside cartooning this is my character
tina
the technical writer and she
interacts with dilbert almost like a
like a spouse
so anytime i think of any jokes that are
more like a
a real couple i have these two interact
as sort of the uh
the office husband and wife now and by
the way i don't know what i'm going to
do
if remote work takes over completely
because it ruins my whole cartooning
thing if i have to have them talking
into computers the whole time
you need a little bit of human
interaction to make a cartoon work
so i'll work that out anyway here's what
i was going to say
the original tina drawings had her as a
quite a skinny individual
but over time and here's the reason you
don't
keep exactly the same art every time
over time you
adjust them a little bit so that they
drift
in the audience's mind
and maybe the audience won't notice it
on any given week
but they become slightly different so
here i'm just making
tina gain a little bit of weight
so tina is going to get a bigger
backside over time
and this is this layer is just the first
draft layer so
this is not the finished art i'm just
sort of giving her dimensions
now for future
future drawings i'll have to make that
adjustment
so by drawing it every time instead of
just plopping them in
the ark gets to drift in this way
there's something about this line i
don't like
so i'm going to make tita heavier over
time
and tina is going to kind of take over
the uh role of uh
you know the uh the phrase of karen
somebody who's complaining about stuff
all the time
here i'm just changing the size of my
brush in this case this is actually the
eraser i've changed
so we're going to make her a little more
bosomy and she's going to gain a little
weight
this year coronavirus is going to
make her a little heavier all right
so so here are the cartoons uh drawn
very
roughly you can see that dilbert's hands
for example
are just approximations and then when i
do the final art
i will draw over them uh
this way so i'll give you a sneak peek
of what that looks like
so this is done in what's called the
layer in photoshop
look where i'm pointing so these are
various layers
so the words are in their own layers and
you could think of this
if this were a physical drawing you
could think of it as
tracing paper so imagine that as a bunch
of tracing paper
in which there's some things on some
paper and
other things on others and ultimately
they're all going to end up in this
this background layer but everything
above this
i get to play around with until i commit
it to you know the final drawing
i'm not sure if you can see that or not
so the layer that the drawing is on is
this one
and when i'm ready to get serious i will
lighten this
layer so that you can just sort of
barely
see it there and then
i will select a different layer the
final layer
and when i draw over this
the only layer i'm going to keep is the
final finished layer
and then when i'm done i'll just make
everything else disappear
by just deleting it so when i'm ready to
do the actual drawing i will come in
tight like this
and here's another adjustment i would
make so
i'm not going to keep the hair the way
it's shown here
oh you can barely see it but right now
it's sticking out a little bit
so when i do the final art
i won't keep that
all right
now inevitably there'll be little flurbs
like
that one in which i need to
reverse it out so i can just push a
button
i've got i've got these little guys
programmed if you can see them
these little buttons here are programmed
uh for my
functions that i want them to perform
within photoshop
so that comes this little keypad thing
comes with the
the device the cintiq that i'm using
and i tell it what each of these keys
are
so they're my little shortcuts
all right so the other thing i can do is
i can
go as tight as i want
so that it's easier
and notice that i'm not um maybe you
can't tell from the angle i've got you
at
but i'm not following my original lines
exactly
this is this is the actual
drawing the other lines are there for
the purpose
primarily of just
of just keeping things in their proper
size and orientation
but the actual drawing is comes at this
layer
and whenever i make a mistake i just
push one button and it goes away
now when it shrinks back down
all of the imperfections disappear
if you were to look at this up close
you'd say to yourself hey
it's like it's a little bumpy over here
and
yeah this these eyebrows don't quite
match and
and all that stuff but that's not the
size anybody will ever see it
they're going to see it about this size
and then all those
imperfections just disappear
so if you look at the rest of this comic
um let's get this stuff out of the way
here's my little floating toolbar i can
put wherever i want
so i start with a file that already has
the boxes
drawn in so i only had to ever do that
once
and then the stuff between the boxes is
there as well so the first layer is what
you saw that is now
um lightened to become the the draft
layer and then i'll do the final drawing
over them
and let me read you this comic since
you've been teased by it here a tina
comes up to dilbert and says do you have
a few minutes to review my first draft
dilbert says yes tina says i ask
because usually you say you're too busy
to help
and dilbert says well i said yes this
time
and then
tina says that's funny because usually
you're all i'm so busy
but today you have all the time in the
world dilber says
today i'm not busy and tina says i find
that suspicious
and dilbert says take yes for an answer
and tina says that's not how innocent
people talk
now if you take this uh this scene for
example
i've got a generic dilbert head in there
but obviously that's not what he needs
to look like
so when we go back to the whoops go back
to the
the layer in which i'm doing the first
draft
we'll show you what this is going to
look like so the first thing that
dilbert would be doing
is i have no idea if you can see this
well by the way because i'm holding it
with one hand and drawing with the other
and not really looking at the screen but
i think you can see it
so dilbert's hair is going to be up like
that
so that's the first thing he's going to
have angry eyebrows
a little bit of anger in his forehead
there
he's going to have squinty eyes that
usually you can't see behind his glasses
but you can when he's mad
he's gonna
let's see will he be bending over he
can't decide yet let's
let's look at it so if i wanted him to
be like scrunching over in anger ah
like he's like you can't stand that he's
balling up in a
in a ball he would be looking like that
or if he's screaming at the sky
he'd be looking like that which would it
be
which should it be should he be balled
up like
or should he be screaming at this at the
sky
well that's the question
looks like your comments have suddenly
disappeared oh there they're back
sky down sky sky
balled up oh there's a difference of
opinion here
sky or balled up sky sky sky
ball down interesting so there's more
sky
than there is balled up so we're gonna
go with the
the majority now um
and i know you can't see it as well from
this angle but i can't draw it
if i if i give you the perfect angle i
won't be able to draw on it
so it's just the first draft so
roughly dilbert's arms will be like this
and his hands will be like this
because he'll be all exasperated so his
his
his fingers will be apart like this
he he'll be leaning back like this
because you've all told me he should be
leaning back leaning back looking at the
sky
okay you didn't all tell me that but
he'll still be in his chair
and his legs will be up a little bit
here's an example of something i'll
probably draw 15 times
which is exactly where are his legs
so again this is the first draft so i
don't have to know exactly where his
legs are going to be when i do that
final layer i'll
make a choice
so he's got two arms and normally you
wouldn't be able to see the second arm
but i'll cheat and move it down a little
bit
so you can see it
sometimes i if i know that dilbert is
going to be exasperated or one of the
characters is
i'll have them carrying something
like coffee or some notepad so they have
something to throw in the air
then you show then we'll put the little
motion lines
ah motion line
his ears are moving
his will give him some perspiration
jumping off his head i always put my
perspirations in
uh odd numbers three or five
never four four would be crazy
all right i need two hands for this next
thing
because i've got to hold the key while i
re
relocate that now um since dilbert's
going to be screaming this
he'll be coming from him
and later i'll put on the lines
the the straight lines are drawn let's
see if
you can see this when i want to do a
straight line
later um i'll just hold down
the shift key
and draw it and it will draw a perfectly
straight line for me
so when i'm ready to do the outline of
the
uh the bubbles the speech bubbles
i just start like this
and make that one go away that didn't
work
and then later i'll fill in the corners
so the way i fill in the corners uh
actually i'll show you
and you're going to say to yourself my
god
that looks like a really hard way to do
that scott let me tell you
let me tell you five ways that this
would be easier
than the way you're going to do it and
all i'm going to say to that is you
think there are five ways that are
easier
but they all have a trade-off so i just
take this corner that i've drawn before
and i stick it on the ends of the lines
that i just
drew and can you even see that
i guess you can and
i'll do that with each of the corners
but i do all the
the top left corners first because these
will all have the same
same box situation so there's a dilbert
he's going to be
going crazy a little bit and then i've
decided that
he probably needs to be a little smaller
but gotta make sure i'm in the right
layer
so he's gonna be a little smaller
because it's gonna look funnier
and then i'll uh i'll fix tina's
expression later to
to match this situation what was that
somehow i got an extra layer in there i
didn't mean and then i'll save my work
because
don't you think i should save it all
right
that ladies and gentlemen is the
intermediate step
of a dilbert cartoon so the the stages
of this i get an idea of some general
thing
i take out my blank file that's just got
boxes in it
i type in the words just imagining who
the characters will be
because for every idea in the dilbert
universe
it's usually kind of obvious which
characters would be involved in that
kind of scenario
so if it's something with authority i
put the boss in there if it's something
absurd i'm
more likely to put dog bird in there if
it's something with human resources
it's gat birth the human resources
director so
you start with the idea you open up a
blank you think what would these
characters do
in this situation you write your joke
then the first layer
i just take the heads that i've used
before
and i just paste them in about where
they're going to be in the scene so i
don't have to redraw every head every
time because they're the same
but the bodies are almost always a
little bit different and i i do draw
them every time
because that allows them to drift over
time
so as i showed you with the tina
character here she started out
as a skinny character but she's going to
be funnier
and this is the only reason to change it
she'll be a little bit funnier
if she's a little chubbier just trust me
on this
it'll be funnier so i'm going to i'm
going to
morph her in time to become kind of a
karen character
uh and it'll just be funnier if she has
a few extra pounds
so that gives us the
the first pass just the heads then i
draw the bodies
and then that's still just the first
draft and then the last thing i do
is i draw over them the final the final
art
and disappear the layer below and then
the first draft is gone
and all i have is the top layer and then
we will add color now adding the color
is as simple as
uh and here's a little trick if you're
if you're at home and you're trying to
do this uh
there's always one thing that the
experts leave out so when you try to do
it yourself it's just
freaking impossible so i'm gonna tell
you
oh
that was my tripod deciding to
crap out just before i was going to tell
you the secret
that you would never learn any other way
coincidence i don't know
maybe but here's the secret
i draw this in grayscale in photoshop
but then i change it to bitmap before
i'm ready to add the color
the bitmap gets rid of the the soft
edges and turns it into hard edges
but because i'm drawing at the right
scale you can't tell that they're hard
edges
so so bitmap is fine at the scale i'm
drawing
and then i take it and i switch it back
into
grayscale and then from grayscale
and you only have to do this because it
doesn't work unless you go through the
intimate intermediate step
uh into cmyk mode
see that now we're getting deep deep
into the
the secret of cartooning once you're in
cmyk mode then you can just
use the paint bucket tool and add the
color
and it will be easy but if you don't
know the process of going from
grayscale to bitmap back to grayscale
all the way to cmyk
you have to figure out some other way to
do it and
good luck with that so there's always
that there's always this one part
that if you didn't know from trial and
error or somebody didn't tell you
it would make you crazy trying to just
to just solve that one thing it's like
how come i add the color
and it doesn't go all the way to the
edges and you would be crazy
so yes then you can do an auto fill but
you can also
do a fill with a gradient that i
sometimes use
um
[Music]
adobe only updates photoshop to force
you to relearn stuff
oh my god it's my biggest problem right
now every time they
upgrade to photoshop
i get in real trouble
do i save the original into bitmap
losing
the history uh i do save uh the
original uh grayscale which i saw
originally i
i draw on grayscale and i do save that
before i do any other versions yes
you have a physical copy of cs6 yeah
it was fine on cs6 right
did you ever need any more than that i
don't know everything else is just
making you work harder
all right that's all for now and i will
uh i'm not going to keep this
up uh too long on youtube
uh maybe today at most and after that
i'll put it on the locals platform
so i've got a subscription community
service there
and this will be there permanently uh
but for today
at least for a few more hours it will be
in replay
on youtube as well
uh you're asking what about converting
to vic
to vector uh you could convey
you could i mean there's just lots of
ways to do it i just choose this way
um that's all for now
