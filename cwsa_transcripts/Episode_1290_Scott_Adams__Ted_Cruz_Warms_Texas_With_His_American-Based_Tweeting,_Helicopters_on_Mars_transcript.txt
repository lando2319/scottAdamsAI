hey everybody
you're right on time i like that about
you
punctuality will always pay off
in fact if you're there on time you're
five minutes late yeah
that's right so i'm glad you're all here
but if you would like to enjoy this
even more i know it's hard to believe
right that you could enjoy this more
it's a big claim but let me back it up
by saying
that if you were prepared with your
copper margaret glass or tanker jealous
designed a canteen joker flask a vessel
of any kind
if you filled it with your favorite
liquid have i ever mentioned
i like coffee and join me now for the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip i'll
bet you know how to do it
it's coming up now go
so let's start with the biggest problem
in the country that has been
solved i'm here to report a lot of a lot
of other
live streams and news sources will be
giving you bad news
all the bad news makes you feel bad
stresses you out
why why when there's so much good news
to report
for example um i know that you had been
suffering from the lack
of uh something called a
uh uh let's see what's it called a
blackfoot
ferret i believe yeah it's called the
blackfooted ferret
and they were extinct until this week
and it looks like the this uh
black-footed
ferret has been cloned to life
they named it elizabeth i call it betty
um or liz just sometimes but it's a
black-footed ferret and a lot of you
were
saying really just last month people
were just talking about this
and talking about it's like there are no
black-footed ferrets
where are all the black-footed ferrets
we have white-footed ferrets that's not
fair
and so not only have we made things
more just racially but
we now have a whole new animal a brand
new animal
i mean it was an old animal that's of
course sort of a classic
brought back but how long before
dinosaurs
i know we haven't found any intact dna
but will that stop us
no i think we're going to be building
some animals
maybe build us up build ourselves a
dinosaur that never existed before
maybe you can't find all the dna for a
proper dinosaur of the past
maybe you find like a couple of
dinosaurs and stick them together
see what you get franken frankenstein
dinosaurs
what could go wrong really um
is it just me or is it obvious like
really obvious
that there's a gigantic available space
for some new political
person with trump off the stage nobody
has replaced
the size of his voice you know biden
doesn't really leave much of a footprint
and we think he's
short-term on the democrat side but as
we're watching the republicans sort of
figure out what life after trump or with
trump on the outside looks like
it's just not obvious anybody
is emerging now i know all the names
that you're going to
mention desantis and ted cruz etc
but when you watch how badly ted cruz is
being
whipped by the media we'll talk about
him in a minute
it's as if they're trying to suppress
ted cruz
because the other side feels like he
might be the biggest threat
they might be right they might be right
he might be at least in the top
certainly in the top four of the biggest
threats i mean he
came in pretty close compared to trump
so it feels like the news about ted cruz
you have to see it through the filter
of they're trying to stop him four years
from now
that's what it feels like we'll talk
about him a little bit more
now if you've been looking at the story
you know that ted cruz and his family
went to cancun while he had no
electricity he was one of the people
affected in texas
and people said hey ted cruz how can you
leave
the country to a warmth when when your
constituents
have to stay here freezing get back here
and be a leader
and so he rather quickly got back in the
plane and got back to texas
or got back to the united states
somewhere i don't know where he is
but um a lot of you don't understand the
importance of this
people are talking about it as if it's
just some kind of a psychological
morale building leadership thing but
it's a it's a lot more than that
and i let me bring you the white board
and this is an important point there's
no way you're going to get to the other
end of this
crisis in texas unless ted cruz
has enough pain so when he went to
cancun and he got all warm things just
went to hell but now as soon as he's
back in the country
suffering a little bit we hope he
doesn't have heat
and i hope they didn't give him a jacket
because if he has a jacket that's just
going to postpone the solution
because he you know he'll feel okay with
at least the jacket on
so you got to get rid of his jacket you
got to get rid of his warmth
and the more pain that we can inflict on
ted cruz
the warmer it will get in texas now
that's not obvious to you you're
thinking it's about
psychology and morale but now the
forecast actually is that by tomorrow
temperatures are going to start changing
it might be
you know at least in houston the the
cold snap is looking like it's going to
it's going to drop and i think that has
everything to do with bringing ted cruz
back
uh not just the fact he's back i'm
talking about the fact that he's back
and tweeting american-based tweets
did you see any of his uh cancun based
tweets
it was like they they were just they
fell apart he would send them and they
would just
like they would evaporate in the air
they're useless
tweeting outside of the united states i
i don't even know why anybody does it
but as soon as he got back on american
soil did you see the power in those
tweets
i i'm miles away and i felt warmer
just reading them now one of the things
that you noticed is that
as soon as people heard that ted cruz
has
left to safety in cancun
a lot of the residents of uh texas
really got kind of hot under the collar
about that didn't they
and does ted cruz get any credit for
that
no he made every forehead in texas a
little bit warmer
because they were so angry about him
going to cancun
i feel that that helped and does he get
any credit for that
no no we act like that didn't even
happen we're all just talking about the
bad side
what about the good side people felt a
lot warmer they were pretty worked up
about that
that's not nothing now
ted cruz did satisfy
the 48-hour rule which i invented
and the 48-hour rule says that if you do
a proper
and proper matters apology within 48
hours of whatever the hell you did wrong
that we should accept it and move on
because i want to live in a world where
people can mess up
and say oh i'm stupid i'm sorry
i did something wrong i know it was
wrong won't do it again
you're right i apologize when people do
that they're just being human
and i get it now the the human part of
this story i
i actually like ted cruz more
because of this story and i'm not
kidding i like him more
because of this story because the
reality of it is that the reason he went
is that his wife and kids stalked him
into it
and he basically says that he was drawn
to be a good father he said but you know
he also had a wife
you know he he's trying to play it
toward it has more to do with the kids
but
he had a wife too and i'll bet she she
had an opinion about how that family
went
so let me tell you this if your family
is
around a fireplace freezing with no
electricity
and you decide to take them to warmth
i am not mad at you ted cruz for
for taking your family to warmth that
was one less family
that the resources of the united states
had to worry about
he had the money to take them away from
the problem
that was the right thing to do indeed
every single politician
in in texas who has the means
to send their own family out of state or
to some place warm
please do it please do it
because the fewer people who are in
danger the fewer people the system has
to support
there's a food problem they're literally
running out of food
wouldn't you like fewer people eating
food if they can afford to go someplace
like
and and if it causes maybe some
extra economic activity wherever they go
well that's good too
now but ted cruz himself you have to say
to yourself okay there's there's also
the leadership thing you have to be on
the front line etc
but uh where's the compassion
do you think ted cruz had less
compassion
because he made his wife and children
warm
it doesn't work that way you can have
plenty of passion
and still take care of your family those
are unrelated
concepts so i would say that the ted
cruz thing says more about
us than it does about him
it says something about ted cruz and he
apologized for it
directly the in fact the quality of ted
cruz's
apology if you will was perfect
it was perfect he told you why it
happened but not as an excuse
just by background which we appreciate
he said it was
a mistake obviously now that's as clear
as you can be
he didn't say well you know you know if
you look at it differently
it wasn't a mistake or uh you know
you're being political
or you're spinning it didn't do that he
said
it's obviously a mistake i felt it as it
was happening
i came right back that's as good as you
can do
for an apology now you of course wish
the situation hadn't happened
but as an apology goes that was the gold
standard
and when people do a proper apology
where they acknowledge exactly what the
problem was no no weasel no spinning
i like them better because you don't get
that from a lot of people it's a it's a
sign of
it's a sign of character i think
uh so ted cruz with his apology
right i'm isolating just the apology
part that's high character
how much do i criticize him for uh
let's say um satisfying the needs of his
family
not a bit zero criticism and
and to be consistent had this been any
democrat just in case you're wondering
had it been any democrat i would say
exactly the same thing
if there are any democrats in texas who
can get their families out
go ahead and do it do it so
but there is this need among the public
you know you and i we need ted cruz to
act differently
but let's not kid ourselves this is
about us right
it's about some need we have that's a
little bit irrational
because is ted cruz really less
effective
tweeting from cancun would he care less
about his state i don't think so
there's no evidence that that would be
the case
what has he done since he got back what
did ted cruz do to make
texas warmer tweet
appear on tv and apologize for going to
cancun
what what exactly could he do so he
comes back
and he gives the public what they ask
for which is he pretends he's on the
ground and
being on the ground and being locally
makes a difference
does it i mean does it
you know the entire country just learned
that driving to work
didn't really matter didn't we
didn't didn't we all just learn that
there was never a compelling reason to
drive to work in the first place we felt
there was
but as soon as we couldn't well maybe we
prefer it this way don't we
suddenly driving to work isn't even that
important
but ted cruz driving to work and being
you know physically there that's still
important
it's not it's just something we need
now it's not it's not nothing because if
the public needs that they need it
but it is based on some kind of a flaw
in us
that we need it i think ted cruz does
need to as a leader he needs to
acknowledge that he has that coming back
matters to
us the public and if it matters to the
public
he has some responsibility to address
that
it's just an irrational need all right
jake novak tweeted and i didn't see this
anywhere else
there's an article on i guess our first
special forces command is building an
information
warfare center that will specialize in
quote
influence artillery rounds in other
words persuasion
so our special forces have a persuasion
wing now to to attack with new
persuasion wherever somebody else's
persuasion had
caused a bad outcome now militarizing
persuasion it had to happen
i mean it's the obvious thing that had
to happen but just think about
how powerful the uh let's say the the
system of persuasion has become
because persuasion as a skill has
existed for decades
we haven't really learned that much in
the last you know 10 or 20 years
about how to persuade we pretty much had
that down
20 years ago maybe longer but what's
different is our ability to instantly
communicate
anything to anywhere anyone anywhere
so once you can instantly communicate
that influence it becomes weaponized
pretty quickly so the government
is creating a basically a brainwashing
group now of course it's under our
national defense umbrella so we assume
it's
defensive and used for our benefit but
what happens to the skills these people
develop
what happens to all the people that
we're using in our military to protect
us
when they learn all these skills about
how to overthrow governments and
change the news and and brainwash people
what do they do after they leave these
jobs
what is their civilian job after they
leave
with these skills it's a problem
it's a problem so this is not free
meaning there's a risk to doing this but
we probably do need to do this
i would imagine this is actually a smart
thing to do to have a weaponized
military group to deal with this kind of
stuff persuasion
let's talk about white supremacy
because it seems to be the uh
the monster under everybody's bed if
they're a democrat anyway
now i've said this before but i feel
like it needs to be said again which is
that
what white supremacy used to be
say when i was a kid was the belief that
white people were better than other
people
but i believe that is extinct as a
belief
now that's not to say there aren't you
know a pocket of people who believe
anything
so it's extinct in the same way that the
flat earth
idea is extinct yes there are flat
earthers
so i'm not going to say a hundred
percent of anything is ever true
it's just hardly ever true that 100 of
something is true
but i've i've never met one
i mean i've never even seen one talking
about it on tv
in the old way the old way was
that there was actually some kind of
genetic superiority
i i don't even see white supremacists
saying that
the people would even call themselves
racists i don't even see them saying
that
and why not because they used to
and the the obvious reason is that
observation
doesn't agree with that opinion you just
have to wake up and turn on the tv
oh wait a minute uh obama was the
president of the united states
wait a minute michael jordan was the
best basketball player
wait a minute kanye west can do just
about anything wait a minute
oprah is the best probably who's ever
done
what oprah does so you can't really
you can't really live and interact in
the world and hold that belief
that somehow white people have this
superiority
like in the old days people used to
think it's just so obviously not true
now here's the dumbest part about white
supremacy
which is
well there's a flip side to it too the
dumbest part about white supremacy as a
belief
let's say you are the white supremacist
now i'm not talking about people talking
about it
i'm talking about this alleged person
who's the white supremacist
why would you take credit for the work
of other people
so so suppose you're saying hey white
people
invented you know all the good stuff or
you're saying hey
white people accomplish this or built
this
or build economies or constitutions or
whatever
and let's say that's true if you were to
just look at the
you know do a checklist and say all
right who
who built the computers okay more white
people than other people
who you know made the smartphones well
well by the time you got to smartphones
companies like apple had lots of lots of
people of all kinds of types working on
it
but let's say you could make the
argument that more historically
less less in current times but more
historically
that a lot of white people accomplished
a bunch of stuff
what's that got to do with you they're
not you
odds are you're not even related
how in the world do you specifically
take credit for what edison or
tesla you know tesla the inventor
how do you take credit for that they're
not you
it doesn't make any sense and likewise
how does black history make sense
how does that make sense because if
you're black and you learn
that somebody black invented something
did something
it's good to remind us you know that
everybody can accomplish stuff
but those people who are black and
accomplish things
they're not you why do you get credit
for that
the same way that i don't get credit for
edison
why do you why does somebody else get
credit for george washington carver
it's just other people doing stuff it
makes no sense
that somehow that has something to do
with me it just doesn't
so you know we've drifted more into a
situation where i think the way white
supremacy is used
in 2021 is that it's
um let's say a system has developed
primarily through the influence of white
people over
over time which is optimized
for white people now that argument isn't
bad
that's not a bad argument right wouldn't
you say that the united states
i i know you know you have your issues
with wokeness and
blood of bladder and cancellation and
those are real things
but wouldn't you say that's a reasonably
true statement
that the united states not and not
necessarily by
intentional design but it sort of
evolved into a place that was optimized
for white people
i don't think it was necessarily
intentional but it just
sort of worked out that way now not
optimized for
every white person right if you were a
poor white person
and you came into a situation where
you're trying to get a job
and there was some preferential hiring
that went to
trying to increase diversity well that
didn't work for you
did it because i was in that situation i
had two careers that i lost
for being white explicitly white and
male
explicitly in other words my bosses told
me that directly
they said we can't promote you because
you're white and male
now was i getting the benefit
it seems like i was being discriminated
against but the truth is
that at the time i could easily get a
college education
and it kind of didn't matter how many
companies were bad to me i just had
other options
so i just went to my other options so it
wasn't good for me but i just
went to my other options because i had
them was
was the united states optimized for a
person like me
in let's say the late 70s when i was
getting started the answer is yes
it was very optimized for people like me
and i took advantage of it so i think
that argument has
some weight but here's a question i have
for you
if you were to actually calculate
reparations
we'll just talk about it hypothetically
i know you're opposed to it this
audience for the most part
but let's talk about there's something
to learn by thinking about it
how would you calculate it now
the the way that we automatically think
is that the way you calculate it is
you'd say
well how are all the white people doing
and then how are all the black people
doing you know whether or not they
descended from
the slavery or not there they sort of
you know get painted by the same brush
and have the same experiences to a large
extent
not completely of course so you know
you could argue there's maybe an
economic difference on average
and so what you're trying to do is you
you know what the gap is
so you base your reparations on maybe
closing some of that gap
right that would be the common way to do
it but does that make sense
is that what is that the way an
economist would do it
let's say the economist had no racial
bias that's not a possibility right
there's no such person
but imagine there were and the economist
was doing
nothing except a calculation what would
be the calculation
well i think they'd go like this they'd
say you're a black person
living in america and if slavery had
never happened
you would be a black person living in
africa
what is the average income in africa you
know normalized by
you know different dollar stuff
etc
[Music]
i guess spam like all times a day so
if you're an economist you'd say how are
the people doing in africa
and how are the people doing who were
victims at least their families were
victims of racism how's her economic
situation
probably better so what do you do with
the fact
that the victims the people who are
descended from slavery and i think
victim is the right word that's not too
strong
do you do when the victims are doing
better than the ones who are not victims
now of course if you were actually a
slave
and you were still alive that's a whole
different conversation because you
specifically
had a really bad thing your life was
stolen from you it doesn't get any worse
than that right
but if you're descended a few
generations down
and you compared where you are today as
a
person working in the united states
compared to what you would have been
if your family had stayed in africa
which one's the better deal
i actually don't know i mean maybe you'd
have to adjust it for
various cultural expectations or
whatever but
how would you calculate that now here's
the other thing that makes it even more
iffy
what is more important money or
happiness
go what is more important what what do
we
what do we put in the constitution
does the constitution of the united
states say you have a right to make
money
well it doesn't restrict that right so
you do of course have that right
but the constitution is sort of silent
on money isn't it
it's happiness the constitution directly
calls out happiness and freedom but
happiness
right so if you're going to pay
reparations
should you pay reparations until the
monetary situation
is you know closer to being equal
or since money is not your top priority
in life
not anybody's happiness is
should you not create a situation where
your happiness
gets to the same level
what do you think is the general
happiness level
of black people in america compared to
white
people in america go in the comments
without looking it up
don't cheat i know you can google this
instantly
but without any cheating what do you
think
is the average black person and the
average white person
in america about the same level of
happiness
or is there a difference go
what do you think without looking it up
people are saying the same same
same same same i'm looking at now why
would you think that
how could it possibly be the same
um i only got one no somebody says
black happiness would be lower um
somebody says black people are more
upset on average i don't think you can
make that claim
that that feels a little bit racist a
little bit racist
you know even if it's right i don't know
if it's accurate
but even if it's accurate it's a little
bit racist
all right um and by the way
it's my belief that 100 of humans
are biased by design you know your brain
is a pattern recognition machine it
doesn't turn
off and you're not good at recognizing
patterns
we see false patterns all the time and
we think they're real i mean
it's a continuous thing so you can't
really turn off the fact that every now
and then
you think or say something that somebody
else thinks is a little racist
it's not a thing and we should stop
pretending like we could do it
it's just not a thing people can't turn
that off you can deal with it
with your better you know your better
moral and ethical fiber you can
you know you can overcome it you can
become a better person but you can't
turn it off
that's not a thing um
so the answer is that uh at least in the
last
you know internet search of some survey
i saw that the
black and white happiness is similar but
here's the weird part
black happiness used to be higher it
used to be higher than white
happiness not too many you know decades
ago
what's up with that what's up with that
and what if what if that had persisted
what if you did a survey today
this is not the case i understand but
what if you found out that black people
were a little bit happier than white
people on average
what the hell do you do with that given
that happiness is
literally our highest goal
i don't know but at the moment it's
equal but black happiness has fallen
is there a reason to believe it will
continue falling
i think so because whatever caused it to
fall in the first place i doubt it
changed
did it i mean what made it fall in the
first place
i don't know i would imagine the social
media isn't helping
is it do you think social media is
making black people happier
i doubt it i doubt it i don't know if
it's making anybody happier
why would it make them happier and not
everybody else doesn't make sense
so i would definitely like to know
what it is that's lowering the average
happiness of
african americans but it does coincide
with smartphones
it does coincide with you know social
media's rise
coincidence maybe maybe
the best form of reparations is to get
rid of social media
because if social media is what caused
the higher black happiness to
reduce to the level of white happiness
maybe the social media platforms are
part of that i mean not intentionally
obviously
so
did it fall or did white happiness rise
according to what i
saw with low credibility white happiness
has stayed about the same
for a long time and black happiness had
been higher but
but was reduced now you can't really
trust necessarily that any of that was
polled correctly you can't trust that
the question was asked
correctly so it didn't have a cultural
bias so you can't
really be sure that's true but what i
can be sure of
is that there's no evidence that white
people are happier than black people
on average right we can be sure we don't
know there's a difference
we can't be sure we know it's the same
all right
so i just throw that in the mix to say
that if we try to calculate this
on economic basis it would be an
irrational act
but it could be an irrational act in the
same way that ted cruz returning to the
united states
was in my opinion irrational but he's
dealing with an
irrational problem which is how people
felt about it
so sometimes you have to deal with
irrational problems with irrational
solutions
that's not even unusual it's sometimes
just the only way you can do it
all right one of my favorite follows
on twitter and and this guy drives me
freaking crazy
in a positive way is uh uh anatoly
lubarski i think he's a game designer
but he follows he follows a lot of my
tweets and then comes into the comments
and debunks
uh a lot of what i say and and a whole
lot of what other people say
i've never seen a more productive
debunker or or anybody who could do it
as quickly
and make a solid case of it so if you're
not following him
look him up so his last name is lubarski
l-u-b-a-r-s-k-y
first name anatoly now i don't know
anything about him
except his tweet activity but his tweet
activity
is so rational and well informed
that you're really missing a lot if you
don't see his take
on the same things that you see me give
an opinion on
especially to see him take an opposite
opinion from me
quite often now he's probably one of the
few people who disagree with me
that i will happily tweet
because uh his disagreement is so well
done
that i'm happy to be called out on it
he just does a good job on it so here's
something he said
that is so funny because it's
i think it's just so right uh
everybody's talking about why it is that
the
uh the infections and coronavirus are
plunging
because shouldn't december or shouldn't
february be a bad month
seasonality blah blah right february
should be a bad month
if the cold has anything to do with
anything or
seasonality has anything to do with
anything this should be our worst month
but in fact the the infection is
plunging everywhere
how do you explain that and so
everybody's been arguing about oh it's
you know the vaccinations are kicking in
other people saying there's a natural
immunity
which i think there's something to that
argument by the way uh but there there
are different explanations
and then uh and then anatoly
lewarski comes in and he says all we're
doing is reverting to the mean
after the holidays and i thought
well it can't be that simple and then
you look at the chart
and all we're doing is reverting to the
mean
after the holidays that's it
that's the whole freaking thing now of
course it matters that we're
you know we're trying hard to socially
distance and wear masks and stuff
i i'm a believer that those things
matter that they make a difference
but we were doing that before the
holidays and it was keeping us at a
certain level of infection
then the holidays came in and it was
this huge thing which we said was
seasonal
but was it seasonal maybe it was only
seasonal because the holidays are
clumped in one season you know the big
ones
where you travel to your family
so just think about this
that all of these explanations you heard
it's like wait
maybe they're secretly using
hydroxychloroquine and it really works
think about all the explanations you've
heard
for the unexplained drop in infections
completely unexplained and then anatoly
says
now it's just reverting to the mean
because the thing that caused the spike
went away and i read that and i thought
uh i think that's
the right answer i don't know that this
is a mystery
at all is it is there any mystery here
it literally just returned to the mean
that's it but
now i'm seeing somebody say wow in the
comments
are you having the same feeling that i i
had when i first read this
which is not only is it right
but it's obvious but it wasn't obvious
until i read his tweet
what the hell is wrong with me how
hypnotized have i been
that something this obvious
wasn't obvious to me i mean i've looked
at those graphs
over and over again and you can very
clearly see
here's the baseline here's the spike
and then it's going back to the baseline
now of course there are lots of other
things happening we're getting better
with therapeutics and
some people say there's something about
the testing that's changed and maybe
it's
biden is in office so they're looking at
it differently
i don't know i don't know it just looks
like nothing happened
except that we stopped going on holidays
where we mingled with each other
let me ask you this suppose you said
uh hey united states here's the deal
for three weeks you can only physically
interact with people that you have
interacted with already
in the past one week
and just say that that's the rule you
can interact with everybody you've
interacted with in the past
week but for the next three weeks
nobody else nobody else goes inside your
house
you never go into a room in which
there's even one person in that room
they have not already been with in the
past week
how hard would that be well
i don't really meet many new people
during a pandemic do you
that would be really easy for me i would
just make a list of the people i've seen
in the last week i'd be like
that's pretty easy now i would still let
a plumber in my house i just make sure
i'm not
standing in the same place right you
know i would still
maybe you know have somebody deliver
doordash or something
but
somebody says stop it stop what
stop what could you be a little more
specific
now i'm not suggesting that we do that
because there's no practical way that's
going to happen
but aren't we sort of at the point where
we kind of know what caused the problem
and the problem is
people interacting who don't normally
interact that's what the holidays did
as soon as you take away people
interacting that don't interact on a
normal weekly basis
infections just fell off a cliff
couldn't we just do that for three weeks
is that the chinese secret
is china's secret that they just
socially distance
they didn't socially distance that much
but they
they did it with only the same people
that they they hang out with i mean
could it be that simple
maybe i'd like to know all right um
then there is the question of whether
half the country is already immune
from either other t-cell stuff or
whatever
i think that i think that hypothesis
is still very much alive but i think the
big drop is probably just
we stopped mixing with strange people
over the holidays
here's a question for you um
how does facebook still make money
there's something going on here isn't
there i've told you before that
a background in economic is like a
superpower
for anybody who doesn't know i've got a
background a degree in economics
and an mba so when you when you have
that
talent in your talent stack it lets you
just
see things that other people can't see
for example i use this example a lot
i i avoid speeding tickets
because i understand economics so i say
to myself
would a police force use a valuable
resource
because everybody's got a budget problem
these days and put it somewhere
where there would be no real danger from
speeding
let's say sunday morning at 9 00 a.m
nobody's on the of the roads it's 9 a.m
would a police force have a speed trap
at 9 00 a.m on a sunday morning when
absolutely nobody's getting in an
accident
and the answer is no because
economically it wouldn't make sense
so there are all these situations in
which you can use economics to actually
see through walls
i can actually see around the corner and
know that there's not
a speed trap if it's sunday at 9am
so my my economics ability literally
figuratively but almost literally allows
me to see around the corner
on the road and know that there's no
speech out there
think about that it's like a superpower
now every now and then
this superpower lets me see things in
other realms as well
and here's what i'm seeing with facebook
i log on to facebook
and i look for posts by the few friends
that i have remaining
and there are none there are maybe
two people in my feed who still post
because they're republicans
or two families i guess and they still
post
because at least one of them is still
traveling you know literally every day
and so it's travel pictures but only one
and uh and then another republican who's
you know does his hobbies and stuff like
that but almost everybody else
is not posting
yeah i'm looking at other comments as
other people are saying
the same stuff now how do they make
money
if people stopped posting because
there's no way
somebody says i see my friends post on
facebook all the time
are they posting about their travel or
their their
their parties that they're at because uh
probably half of facebook was where you
went
and the group of people you were with or
even you know pictures of your food at
that nice restaurant
you went to and then there's also
pictures of people just you know looking
good
but if you're wearing your mask
nobody really wants those pictures to be
part of their permanent record except as
the novelty of it
right somebody says my friends just post
memes and jokes but i'll bet not more of
them
right probably not that much more
so you've got facebook who has the
pandemic
in my observation their
number of posts are probably down 60
percent
at least 30 percent am i completely
wrong
i'm talking about individuals just
posting pictures of their life
is that not down 60 percent
could somebody tell me i'm looking at
the comments to see if people are
agreeing
is this just my observation now i'll get
that there's more activity in the lists
and the groups i'm hearing the people
who are advertising
just anecdotally anecdotally i'm hearing
that advertisers are
not advertised people who are
advertising their
services are still doing great so they
seem to be getting just as much response
so you're seeing a lot of people sharing
articles
somebody says wrong completely but you
don't give any
details somebody says the gamers are
keeping it afloat
somebody says i stopped posting
uh some some no longer use it so most
people are agreeing with my observation
that there's less activity at least on
the posting part
so do you believe that other activities
magically
increased to fill the gap
do you think so do you think that people
are spending as much
time on facebook just but they're just
doing other things
and that just magically their interests
went from the thing they were doing
which is
you know showing their vacations and
whatnot suddenly they like
memes and groups and lists
maybe i mean it could have happened
people spending more time at home
maybe they've got a little more time but
it doesn't smell right to me
all right here's the other thing to add
to this
they don't have um election campaign ads
because the election's over that had to
be a huge source of revenue right and it
just stopped
at least until the next election at the
same time
i i've seen some uh allegations that
facebook now i don't know if this is
true it's just allegations
that facebook had uh been aware that its
statistics it was giving to advertisers
were inflated
i don't know if that's true it's just an
allegation that's in the news
this week now let me ask you this
let's say you work for facebook and you
sell ads it's your job to sell ads
do you go to the advertisers and you say
uh
here are our statistics from the the
last week
and you can see the traffic is way down
so the amount will charge you for your
ad
will be based on this traffic being way
down
so we're going to have to give you a big
discount do you think that it goes that
way
is that is that how sales people work
let me explain how a sales person
works they work for commissions usually
i don't know if that's the case in
facebook but in any case everybody wants
to do a good job
and the salesperson says this
they say look at my traffic for
2020 which might have been high
um and we'll base your advertising fee
based on the traffic from that last year
because that's the full
the full year we have we're not going to
base it on the last
month because you know it was unusual
month and blah blah blah blah
don't you think that advertisers are
overpaying
i feel like they might be do you think
that the advertisers are aware that
people aren't posting as much on
facebook does facebook tell the
advertisers that
it's like hey hey guys it's okay people
are posting way less
because the pandemic they they can't
show a picture of their
you know ted cruz is not going to show
the pictures from cancun on facebook
right
and then you can extend that to other
people who also don't want to do that
now when when i had my delayed
honeymoon recently went to bora bora
we did post some pictures but i didn't
feel comfortable about it let me tell
you
i didn't feel comfortable about it we
were trying to
preserve some sense of normalness but
maybe it was inappropriate
i felt a little bit like ted cruz did
which is that
if if i were not suffering enough
i wasn't enough of a team player you
know what i mean
but i powered through it
i managed to enjoy it anyway so i've got
a big question about
facebook i'm not so sure their business
is as solid
as maybe their stock price would
indicate
all right um
ed martin tweeted this and i love this
thought
he tweeted that the russia hoax which is
sort of an election-based hoax right
something about the election and russia
so the russia hoax
and the fine people hoax which was about
white supremacy
uh got together and basically had sex
and created the pelosi insurrection hoax
so if you if you look at the capital
insurrection hoax
the idea that they were actually
literally trying to conquer the united
states
with their viking horn hat and their and
their zip ties
if you look at that hoax it is literally
the combination
of an election-based hoax the russian
oaks
and the fine people hoax a white
supremacist hoax
they actually married two hoaxes and
made a new hoax
and i love this observation because
it feels like exactly what happened
doesn't it
anyway so good tweet ed martin
um looks like nancy pelosi hired a
racist
to hunt down uh mega people uh
that's what matt gates uh tweeted this
morning so this uh
was a general honorary or whatever
i'm just gonna say this that he looks
like a nut job
and probably a racist
just based on what we can see of him and
some clips about things he said
and remember i told you was it
maybe in the spring of last year
and i tweeted that uh if biden got
elected
republicans would be hunted
do you remember how much i got for
that
you know they all the democrats just
grabbed that tweet and
it they got republished in various you
know left-leaning publications
look at this idiot can you believe it
the cartoonist says if biden gets
elected
the republicans are going to be haunted
they're going to be haunted it's
happening
it's happening now didn't you think that
was the weirdest prediction
probably not some of you some of you
probably were already there
but if you if you look at how weird some
of my predictions have been that have
that have come in this one was pretty
weird
but um i would say that is is now proven
right
all right new news uh secretary of state
uh blinken under the biden
administration says they're willing to
meet face to face
with iran and talk about it and they
want to get back with the
other united nations countries that are
part of the
conversation with iran
now is that good
now if you were to just read this story
on the surface
it sounds pretty good you got you got a
nuclear issue
but iran is willing to talk about it and
negotiate
now biden's team is willing to talk
about it and negotiate
pretty good on paper right if you didn't
know any context
pretty good because you certainly would
rather be talking about
nuclear war than you know building
toward it
so it's all good isn't it well here's
some context that
was left out and uh joel
 pointed this out in a tweet
that if the biden administration starts
negotiating with
iran and and gets back to something like
obama's old nuclear deal with iran
it's basically a green light to israel
to attack
iran and change the regime and get rid
of their nuclear weapons program
now would you say that
would that be your opinion that israel
would now have a green light to take out
the
regime of iran if biden's team looks
like they're going to
sign on to a deal that would doom
israel in the long run according to
israel
i think so i think this is a green light
to attack
so was the trump
approach more likely to create war
or less likely remember i told you
i'm going to remind you of this so many
times you're gonna be so sick of me
you're already sick of hearing it
the longer trump is out of office the
smarter he will look
as long as he sort of stays out of
things right
as soon as he gets back into things and
becomes part of the headlines
then we're back to where we were but
it does look to me like biden has set up
a path that guarantees
war with at least one nuclear power
israel and and one you know
fledgling nuclear power
am i wrong is this is this not a fair
analysis
that it seems pretty clear that what
whatever trump was doing
was likely to cause flare-ups of maybe
some terrorism but even
he'd even it looked like he'd even
scared iran out of some of their
terrorist
ambitions not all of them of course but
it looked like they had
tamped it down a little bit right now as
soon as biden's in
one of their proxies uh hurts americans
in iraq
it's not a coincidence it looks like
biden has just created a
clear path to a major war
are you surprised well a lot of people
said that biden was
part of the war party you know
associated with the industrial military
complex
and various people who like war because
it's profitable
so trump looks like the smart one
trump looks like the smart one on this
topic period he looks like the smart one
and i don't know if that's going to
change there's a new book
alleging that uh julene or is it
jizz lane i never know maxwell
appeared appeared to admit
appeared being a key word here appeared
to admit
that jeffrey epstein was taping donald
trump
and the clintons visiting i guess
epstein's island and
whatever during a 26 meeting with
so this alleged admission
um happened with a 2016 meeting with
former cbs producer ira rosen
who writes this in his new book all
right so here's what we know
uh and then apparently gillette gillane
said that she didn't want to admit where
the
trump tapes were because then people
would ask for the clinton tapes
and she wanted clinton to win
all right so that's what's reported and
this the source of this
is a book with no
tapes or no text messages just
somebody who said he heard it now what
level of credibility
do you put on a story that's in a book
and the most interesting thing in the
book is this story
which is what sells the book what
credibility would you put on that
zero yeah exactly zero
now that doesn't mean it's not true and
i'll say this every time i use the word
credibility
just says how you should treat it it
doesn't say whether it's true or false
but the credibility is zero there's no
no credibility if you give this any
attention
you're a sucker because this is a pure
sucker play right here
there's now what do you think are now
aside from the fact that there's no
credibility because the source is coming
from
an author selling a book with no no
documentation to support it right
but could it be true well anything could
be true but i feel like we would know it
by now
so i imagine that whatever happened was
probably you heard it wrong or
remembered
it wrong or she answered unclearly it's
probably something like that
but all right
here's a question why are cat why is
california
and flor doing about the same as florida
when the way that they're handling the
coronavirus
is completely different so california
had
strict lockdowns florida was more
permissive with opening schools and
business
but the curve looks about the same how
do you explain it
well let's go back to my previous note
uh
anatoly will explain it by the only
thing that mattered
was that it's not christmas anymore
maybe that's it maybe none of the other
stuff makes much of a difference
maybe now the other thing you have to
factor in
is that california might have had to far
worse infections
so it could be that if california had
not locked down
and done you know stricter things that
they wouldn't have been similar to
florida
it would have been much worse now why am
i saying
that florida that california might and
this is speculation this is pure
speculation
why am i saying that california might
have more more infections
because they're locking down harder
right
oh it's the thing i'm not allowed to say
isn't it
what's the thing i'm not allowed to say
you can say it in your head now what
does california
have as far as the situation that
florida doesn't have forget about the
politics and forget about the
um the rules for the pandemic
why what is what else is there about
california that's a little bit
different oh i'm seeing
a bunch of racists saying stuff in the
comments somebody's saying it's because
we have an open border with mexico
so a lot of infected people presumably
might be coming over the border and
making it impossible
for california to control the infection
whereas florida has at least a little
bit of a water
boundary there so fewer people streaming
screaming infected
but that is very racist of you and i
would never say that
so racist
but back to anatoly lubarski's
comment might be that the only thing
that really matters
is that we're not having holidays at the
moment could be
that that's 80 of everything but there's
a solid 20
we don't understand at least right and
that 20
could have to do with immigration being
more permissive
in california can i say that out loud
without being canceled what do you think
is that just a statement of statistics
or is it just automatically racist
because it has something to do with
immigration
we live in we live in uh dangerous times
i don't know if you can make
an obvious statement that if your border
is open
and people who could be infected are
coming across it that you're in
worse shape than if you didn't do that
isn't that fair to say
but we don't say that much out loud all
right
um so what else we got going on how
about uh
i guess johnson johnson announced uh
that there they filed with the the world
health organization for emergency use of
its
single-dose uh covert vaccination so now
there will be a one-dose vaccination
i'm guessing that it will not be as
effective but it could
i think it's both in the 90 range like
one's in the low 90
ones in the mid 90 something like that
right so
it might be a little less effective but
not so much less
that it would matter that much right so
i told you that everybody asked me are
you going to get the vaccination when
it's available to you
and i always said i'm going to wait till
the last possible moment
when i have the most possible
information
because it might we might find out that
one of the vaccinations is better than
the other
right i mean that seemed obvious that we
would at least hear a story about that
even if it's not true
uh we might find out that one has some
side effects that we didn't know about
so i'm waiting till the last minute
to make my decision i'm leaning toward
getting it
so i'd be really surprised if i don't
get the vaccination
but this is the kind of thing i'm
waiting for right
now did you know that
within the time that we're waiting for
the vaccination we might get approval
for a single vaccination
that was worth waiting for right so
i didn't have an option of getting it
but that's why i
wait on the decision all right so i
would be far more likely to favor the
single shot than the double shot
um here's the good news we
nasa just put a helicopter on mars you
know i
i tweeted and live streamed on this but
i just can't stop
being happy about this nasa put a
helicopter on car
on mars and it's a i guess it's a little
a helicopter that's built for their
atmosphere how do you build a flying
device
for another world
i mean how incredibly awesome
is this and if you understand the number
of technical challenges that all had to
be solved just right
and nothing could go wrong i mean
everything had to work
just right to get this thing to land
safely in one of the most hardest places
to land
this is a big deal and
i've said this before but i i can't
again i can't say this enough
whoever controls space will control
everything
because if you control space you've got
a good chance of controlling the planet
because whoever has the high ground
controls the planet
there's probably more wealth ultimately
in space
ultimately not right away um
whoever gets up there is going to own
the united states
now how big is it that i think we're the
first
the united states to put a flying
a flying object
on mars because you don't control mars
unless you control the sky on mars
and we put the first flying device on
mars
we are the closest so far
to controlling the sky
militarily on mars
you don't think that matters do you it's
going to matter a lot
now it might not matter to you but it's
going to matter to your grandkids
because whoever controls the sky and
you know the air in mars controls mars
and whoever controls mars has a base and
space
that would be unparalleled the moon
might even be better but
mars is pretty important for controlling
space
right so militarily is gigantic
how it makes us feel as a country is
gigantic
is this a trump accomplishment or a
biden
accomplishment well i think it got you
know it probably has been started even
before trump i would imagine
so i'm not sure you can give people
credit but at least trump must have
funded it
at the very least he funded it right
so this is the sort of thing that i
think trump has
the smart strategic advantage
if biden is not working on nuclear power
really hard and working on conquering
space
really hard and making sure that we have
flying
technology in space flying technology
both for the outer space part but also
on planet
if those aren't highest priorities for
the future
biden isn't getting it right i think
trump understood that
don't you yeah and i think elon musk of
course
understands it so yeah and trump did
space force
right space force was not just because
it's going to look good on his resume
space forces because he understood
power if there's one thing that trump
understands that nobody should be
arguing about
he gets power right he knows how power
works
all the all the ins and outs of power
and he looked at space
and said uh oh if somebody else has that
power
someday space we're doomed
we have to have that power and so he
went out and
and created the seeds and we're seeing
it start to
come to fruition of that power
i i think trump is is beyond
smart president he's visionary if you
look at
space force as an example so
he'll know i don't know if he'll ever
get enough credit for that but he should
um and the other good thing i told
i was saying on a live stream yesterday
i did a little impromptu walk in my
neighborhood if you saw that
and i noticed yesterday for the first
time that one of the facilities near me
there's a big
fairgrounds facility not too far and
they put up a giant
tents and they built a vaccination
center now of course there have been
vaccination centers for some time
in other places and we know that the
vaccinations have been rolling out of
course
but i have to tell you that when you see
a giant human-made
vaccination center pop up in your town
it'll change you it doesn't feel the
same as just
knowing it's happening i actually cried
when i saw it because this was the point
where
the humans go on offense right
defense is putting on your mask and
socially distancing and closing your
schools
that's just defense i don't really want
to be
in the military that only plays defense
i want to win and winning
requires offense now of course i'm
speaking just figuratively
but vaccinations look like offense to me
that doesn't look like defense and the
the psychological
morale uh thing that that did to me
watching watching my town go on offense
for the first time
so maybe your towns have been on offense
for a while if you got it first
but my town just went on offense
i'm very very happy about that it
happened about the same time
that my country put a helicopter
on mars who put the helicopter on mars
was it the politicians
well they helped but it was the
engineers
american engineers and they did work
with people born in other countries
et cetera so um you know
different uh uh national origins were
involved in the
the landing but let's say mostly
american engineers
just saved our bacon in the future
or they're on they're on a path to doing
it meaning giving us
some military uh assets in space
at the same time our scientists built
these vaccinations in record time
politicians helped right the politicians
did their job on
on both cases but we're watching
our best scientists and our best
engineers re-engineer our whole freaking
civilization
right in front of you we watched our
engineers say
wait a minute you can't commute well we
got this
other technology now a lot of those
engineers were in china i suppose the
zoom people
but the point is that engineers and
scientists
are really pretty big heroes
i mean not to take away from the front
line responders who are
in a category of their own hero wise
but i don't think we give enough credit
to the
engineers and the scientists you know we
complain about the science all day long
but usually we're complaining about what
journalists told us about science
or what politicians told us about
science we're not
really complaining about science because
we don't have access to it directly
but they're doing some stuff i'll tell
you that stuff we can't see directly
the science they're doing some stuff
just put a helicopter on mars if i
haven't mentioned that before
so um is the golden age here
might be what do we have in front of us
probably peace in the middle east there
might be a war with iran before we get
there
but it will be short if it happens
probably space colonization is
entering its golden age probably the way
we
manage future pandemics is forever
changed
taking that risk which was a gigantic
risk
and probably figuring out how to
put that back into a smaller box
um so it's easy to get caught up on you
know who got cancelled
and what's in the headlines and who's
arguing with who and
our country is divided and stuff but
we're working on nuclear fusion
space exploration you know
vaccines like we've never seen i think
education will be
i think there are now uh corey deangelis
is does the best reporting on this about
the school choice
and i think there are 23 if i have it
right
23 state legislatures who have put forth
legislation
for funding to follow the child instead
of the school
the effect of that is if your child
decides to go to a non-public school
that the funding would follow the child
and help fund the
the other entity so almost half
of the country now is that a big deal
yeah yeah that's that's really big
because the teachers unions are the
primary source
of systemic racism and systemic racism
is probably the biggest problem in the
country at least
domestically right and and we have
it looks like we are marching pretty
quickly
towards solving it by taking money away
from
their control and allowing the student
to go where they want with the you know
parents of course and and
take the money with them this is
so big it's all it's almost incalculably
is that a word incalculably
large if it keeps going the way it's
going so you still need to get there
but it's going the right way right
so um who promoted that
yes i think trump was one of the louder
voices and the debt
and the republicans in general were the
louder voices on that
topic somebody says no systemic racism
is not the biggest problem
it's the biggest problem in uh in terms
of
uh disunity in the country now
if you're saying that it's not real
here's my definition
of systemic racism which is that
if you can't get a good education
because you're
let's say in a depressed part of the
country if you can't get a
good education and you don't have a
choice
that does suggest that there's a ripple
effect all the way from slavery
to the current world and even though
it's true that you know
black people can succeed of course
there is an average difference that's
real
there's an average difference and of
course there's a ripple effect from
slavery
how could there not be so that doesn't
mean it's your fault
and it doesn't mean you have to lose
your job to fix it
that's a whole different conversation
i'm saying that if you could fix the
schools
you would eventually and it wouldn't
take that long maybe one generation
probably stop talking about systemic
racism because everybody would have an
education that wanted one
and you know the the
economic disparity would close on its
own etc
so it's a big deal it's a big deal all
right that's all for now and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
i've gone on too long i've gone on too
long and i'll talk to you tomorrow
