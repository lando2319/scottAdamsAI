All right, let's check our
stocks. And they look like they're in a
healthy situation today. Yeah, Tesla's
up. All right, let's have a
show. Going to check my
comments. There we go.
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains, all you
need for that is a copper mug or a glass
of tank or gels to stay in a canteen jug
or
flask, a vessel of any kind. Fill it
with your favorite liquid. Well, I like
coffee. And join me now for the un
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day. The thing that makes
everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip. And it happens now.
Go.
Perfect. Well, let's see if there's any
science that they could have skipped
just by asking me. Oh, here we go.
Uh my favorite writer lately, Eric Dolan
and
Cypost. He's uh reporting that uh women
with
ADHD have less consistent orgasms during
partnered sex. I'm glad they said
partnered. Now, do you think they needed
to do that study? Now, I don't know the
answer to this because of my personal
exploits.
I know the answer to this because I know
what ADHD is and I know what an orgasm
is. And I'm pretty sure that if you're
thinking about something else while
you're having
sex, your orgasm will not be so
powerful or likely to happen. So yeah,
next time uh you need to know if ADHD is
going to interfere with anything,
including sex or anything else, just ask
me. Um, yes. I think their minds would
wander a little
bit. Here's another one. Also, Eric
Nolan, also
Cypost. Um, apparently psychedelic
experiences are linked to long-term
improvements in psychological
flexibility. You know who else they
could have asked that question of? 100%
of people who have ever had a
psychedelic
experience. That's the main thing it
does. The main thing it does is make you
see the world as sort of subjective and
then you get flexible because if the
world is
subjective, you don't have to be locked
into any one way of thinking or one way
of perceiving. So yes, next time you
want to study something about
psychedelics, just ask me. I got the
answers.
Well, because I have to know this, uh,
I'm going to make all of you know it,
too. If you were trying to avoid the
Diddy the Diddy trial because you'd hear
something that would
uh that would destroy your brain
forever. Uh, you might want not want to
listen to this next
thing. Okay. It's not funny. It's not
funny. Stop it.
It's not funny because there was a
serious crime alleged here. But now
there's new
lawsuit. According to uh Breitbart News,
there's new lawsuit of a woman who says
that Shaun Denny Combmes um tried to
rape her. Uh but that she was not that
afraid once she once he whipped out his
manhood because she described it as
Tootsie Roll sized.
Now, are you ever going to be able to
imagine him in any context again without
imagining the the Tootsie Roll?
No. That's the most devastating thing
you could do to him is do the the
Tootsie Roll thing. Oh my goodness. But
in related news, the New York Post is
reporting that uh Justin Bieber's rep,
his rep, not him, his rep um said that
he was not a victim of Shan Combmes. So
if you're worried about Bieber being a
victim of Shan Cones, his
rep his
rep says it didn't happen. Now, if you
can't trust a celebrity rep, who can you
trust? Yeah. So, we're not going to
believe the
rep. I I I hope it's true that he was
not victimized, but you're going to need
to do better than the
rep.
According to Brendan Carr at the
FCC, Verizon has now agreed to end its
DEI policies. Um, and uh, that's good
news. Now, you might know that uh, I was
a victim of DEI back in my phone company
working days. I never worked for Verizon
or any of the companies they absorbed,
but um I did experience the DEI effect.
So, this one makes me a little extra
happy because it feels personal. So,
Verizon, we'll see if you actually
really get rid of your DEI policies or
are you just going to change the names?
They might just change the names. We'll
check in with them later.
All right, here's the uh the the big
story everybody wants to talk about
today. So, apparently James Gome, ex
head of the FBI, has arranged some
seashells on the beach and then took a
picture of them and the shells were
arranged in four digits
8647. Now, 47 we
assume refers to Trump. He's the 47th
president.
86 is a food
services reference to getting rid of
something.
So, Secretary Christy Gnome as um she
she posted an ex disgraced former FBI
director James Comey just called for the
assassination of
Trump. and uh she says that the
Department of Homeland Security is and
Secret Service are going to investigate
this threat and will respond
appropriately.
Likewise, FBI Director Cash Patel, he's
all over it. He says, "We are aware of
the recent social media post by Comey
and uh directly at Trump." He says, "And
we're in communication with the Secret
Service and director current primary
jurisdiction is with the Secret Service,
but the FBI will provide necessary
support." Now, if you were not aware
that 86 has a meaning beyond being a
number, you might not have worked in a
food services kind of job as I have. Uh,
I spent years working for in kitchens
and I was a dishwasher and I was a line
cook and I was a salad cutting guy. Uh,
so I was always in and then I owned a
couple of restaurants. So 88 86 was
common phrase. And so if my boss told me
to 86 the
lettuce, I knew that that meant get a
high-powered rifle and hide it in the
bushes near the golf course and then
shoot that lettuce when it came
by. Right? That's what that means. It
means assassinate the
lettuce. Right?
This this story strikes me as so dumb
that on one hand it's deadly serious
because all it takes is one crazy person
to say he sends the signal he sends the
assassination signal. On the other hand,
the odds that he will get in any kind of
serious legal trouble for using a common
word that means get rid of
something really low. Uh, I don't think
he's going to jail because he used a
common food services term with
seashells.
So, we can speculate what he was
thinking and we could speculate what
other people might think when they see
it and whether he thought that they
would think
that. But I think he is in probably safe
territory. He's not going to go to jail
for using a food services term for
getting rid of something.
Yeah, we we never thought of it as
assassinating the food. So, I don't
think he's in
trouble. But, of course, the news will
be all over it today and you're going to
hear that story so many times and people
will act terribly shocked and offended
and and it's the worst thing in the
world. They use that term
86. All right, so that's coming.
Um Joe Rogan had a Harvard uh I guess a
persuasion mind control expert and uh I
saw a good summary of that on ex by the
vigilant fox who's a good account to
follow. you should follow the vigilant
fox and uh the expert her name is
Lemoff. She talked about how uh back in
2012 there was a an experiment done on
Facebook where they uh they achieved
mass emotional contagion at scale. So
whatever what they did was they uh they
give one group of people without them
knowing it. By the way, this experiment
was done on users of Facebook without
the users knowing they were part of an
experiment.
Um some of them were given all these
negative words and the other was were
fed a stream of positive
words. And then they found out that the
group that was exposed to more positive
news feed
uh also had a measurably statistically
significant effect of more positive
emotional
response and the control group was
unaltered by
this. Now did they really need to run
that
experiment? Was there anything they
could have done that would have been
cheaper and faster than running that
big somewhat unethical experiment
because the people didn't know that they
were part of the
experiment? Yes, they could have just
asked me because every hypnotist and
everybody in
advertising would have known what would
happen. If you give people a bunch of
negative words, they feel negative. If
you give them a bunch of positive words,
they feel positive.
And it's not that
complicated. It's probably the the
single most well understood thing in all
of the in all of
persuasion. You know, I doubt you could
find even one hypnotist who wouldn't
tell you, "Oh, you don't need to do that
experiment." Yeah. All the negative
words would make one group feel bad and
the positive words would make the other
group feel good. Yep.
Um, but here's what you need to know.
That's basically CNN and MSNBC every
night. Now, they're not running it as an
experiment. It's just how they operate.
So, you know that word
chaos. Do you think it's an accident
that they all use that word and then
when they they get a new word, they all
use it? It's the same thing.
BA basically the news is a you know
persuasion tool and they use negative or
positive words based on the story and
uh it's very persuasive that that's why
people who watch any one of those news
shows at the expense of watching the
others seem to you to be emotionally
unbalanced and and it's because they are
and you would be too if you only watched
one news source, you would either get,
you know,
unrelenting good news about one side and
unrelenting bad words about the other
side and and you'd be quite
triggered. Well, Trump is back from his
successful Middle East trip and I got to
say it is one of the most
impressive, you know, successes that
I've ever seen. Uh I don't think we've
seen a
president just dominate the news and do
such a you know impressive job in other
countries but I I saw a Joel Pollock of
Breitbart did a little summary of what
was achieved and I think maybe the list
is even longer than this but uh Joel's
list is uh that Trump got us respect and
gratitude from the Arab world. Yes.
Investment deals for the USA. Yes. Big
ones. Release of the American Israeli
hostage. Well, that timing was pretty
good, huh? Clear statements of US
interests and values. Yes. Uh tough
message to Iran. Yes. Uh uh a distinct
though linked path from Israel. You
know, a little bit of distance from
Israel, but we can see how we're
connected. Yes. Bipartisan praise at
home. Yes.
and a strong personal
image. So yes, now do you remember that
it was
only oh I don't know two weeks ago when
if you would ask Democrats they would
have said that it's quite obvious to
everybody that President Trump is the
laughing stock of other
countries. Do you remember that?
And does anybody remember me saying that
no, other countries are
transactional. If Trump offers something
that they want, they're going to love
him. If he offers them something they
don't like, they're going to demonize
him. And all all this stuff you think
about how, oh, they just have an
impression of him and it's negative and
they think these none of that's real.
That it's all about what he can do for
him. And apparently they think he can do
a lot for him in the Middle East because
they really really put out the red
carpet. But uh I would say that the
biggest thing he accomplished is that he
reframed war as
commerce. And I'm going to say it in my
own words, but this is what I got out of
it. You know, mostly from his speech,
but also from just the way he did
business.
I I think I think he just thinks that
war is just the worst thing ever and
he's very consistent about that. You
know, when he talks about it, we just
want to stop the killing,
etc. But, uh, in a world where everybody
has to be connected
commerce-wise, I think he just sees that
commerce is the better tool. Do you want
to be part of the world economic global
economy? Yes. Well, then you're going to
have to stop killing
people. If you don't want to be part of
the world economic global community,
basically the only way you could ever
thrive, you don't have to be. And we'll
be happy to cut you out and you can just
suffer and
starve. And it feels to me like he's
this is his greatest accomplishment.
I'm going to go a little further and say
it might be the greatest
accomplishment of any leader in any time
in American well no human history not
American history human history. Now,
part of it is because he's he's born in
a specific time. You know, uh 300 years
ago, you didn't need to maybe do some
international trade, but you can't
really
survive unless you're plugged into the
international commercial network of
everything. And I think Trump is the
first one to say war is obsolete.
It's
obsolete because in theory you could get
almost anybody to do almost anything to,
you know, bring them from some extremist
situation into the
fold by just making it clear that the
only way you'll ever thrive is to act
like a responsible country and then you
could be part of the world commercial
situation. Now, he hasn't said that
directly, but that sure feels like where
he's heading with Iran, with Russia,
etc. He's not saying, "If you don't give
us what we want, we're going to bomb the
hell out of you." He doesn't take it off
the table. It's not off the table. But
he said clearly that the the alternative
for Iran would be being crushed
economically and the alternative for
Russia was to be further
sanctioned.
So I feel like it's one of the greatest
accomplishments of any leader in the
history of humanity really if he pulls
this off.
It's not completely pulled off,
but he seems to have reframed it in a
way that we can all
understand. Well, according to the uh
Kobe Kobes letter on X, uh Trump's
investment, he raised uh
uh $2.5 trillion in capital for the US.
Now, we don't know over what time
period, but uh UAE was in for 1.4 4
trillion that they want to invest in the
US. Saudi Arabia 600 billion. Qatar 500
billion. Um these are the very big
numbers, but they're not as big as what
Trump says it
is. So those are the numbers based on
news reports and what those countries
have said out loud. But uh Trump says
that his his trip is worth 12 to 13
trillion and includes deals already
announced and some that will be, you
know, outlined
shortly. So, and he's going to be
sending out letters to nations for trade
deals
soon. So, I don't know. So, somewhere
between 2.5 and 13 trillion is what he
came back with. But I I don't know how
much of this to believe because when you
look at the uh what the Arabs nations
said they would contribute or actually
invest not contribute um I don't know is
that over 10 years or 20 years. So I
don't even know how to how to say if
that's important or not. Um I don't feel
it like nothing in my life changed.
Um, so I'm going to say I'm not 100%
sure anything in your life will change
either, but it's way better than not
getting those
deals. So a lot of what Trump does is
salesmanship and selling the country
and, you know, creating an image and,
you know, just making people think
differently. You know, that's what he
does best. So, if what he's done is
created this situation where all the
smart people are putting massive amounts
of money into the United States because
it's the best place to invest, and it
probably is. It's probably the best
place to invest. Um, that would be
amazing. So, I can quibble about what
the real number is and how big it is,
but what he's done is make everybody
think in that way.
uh meaning that if he visits your
country, you better open your
wallet, and I think people
will. So, not only did uh Republicans
think he did a great job in the Middle
East, but Fox News and others reporting
that uh former Biden
officials, people who would be, you
know, deeply critical of Trump are also
saying,
"Wow, like he he seems to have
accomplished a lot in one trip.
And so podcasters are saying it. Axio
spoke to several Biden administration
officials. Um, and some of them are
saying that Trump's audacious foreign
policy moves were um, pretty pretty
amazing. One official anonymously said,
uh, gosh, I wish I could work for an
administration that could move that
quickly. So even if he didn't love
everything that Trump has done
everywhere, you look at this and you say
to yourself Biden could not do
this, I don't think there is a single
Democrat who actually knows what they're
talking about who would say, "Oh yeah,
Biden could have done that. I, you know,
he probably almost did." Nope. I think
people are absolutely recognizing that
he's a singular personality and that he
can literally do things that other
people can't do. And when you start
imagining a world in which you're not
locked into all the same choices and
that when Trump shows up, you have more
options and some of them look pretty
good. He's sort of someone who can make
something happen that all the smart
people thought couldn't happen.
And that the value of
that is
incalculable. Just think about that.
There's one personality really just one
in the whole world where if he aims his
airplane at your country, things can
happen that just couldn't have happened
without him. Nobody else is like that. I
I don't even know historically if
anybody's ever been like that. So, the
fact that he's not afraid of anything,
he's not afraid to take you in a
different direction, he's not afraid to
upset you, he's not afraid to try
something that might fail, he's not
afraid to try something and it doesn't
work, then he has to quickly pivot and
change it. His lack of
fear combined with his common
sense, we've never seen
this. We've just never seen this.
So, you know, uh I do I do appreciate
that the Democrats are not blind to
it. They can see it, too. Now, there's a
uh a rumor that I'm pretty sure is false
that uh Trump is at least considering
the idea of promoting a two-state
situation and backing Palestine,
Palestine as a its own country. I don't
think that's going to happen. What do
you
think? I feel like he would have already
signaled that. Now, we're seeing that
Trump is uh made it very clear that
Israel is not going to be yanking his
chain. So, he's created some distance
from Israel without creating any kind of
a, you know, major economic or other
problem. Um, but he's very clearly
signaled that he's going to do what's
good for the US and that's it. If Israel
doesn't like it, Israel just has to deal
with it. So, we we haven't seen that
before. Um, so I went to Grock and I
wondered how many of the Palestinians
themselves want a two-state solution.
And it turns out it's just
wildly difficult to get any kind of a
read on that uh according to Grock. But
the numbers range from 24% to
74%. So we don't know exactly because
the range is so big. We don't know
exactly if even the Palestinians want a
two-state solution. I just assume that
they all
did. But maybe not. Or maybe it's just
that the limitation in the polling over
there is so bad that you know it's 74%
plus could
be. But then I wondered how many of the
Israelis want a two-stage solution. Um
according to Gallup in 2024 only
27%. And if you looked at the only the
Jewish Israelis it's as low as 17%.
Um,
so I I don't even know how many people
want it. You know, if you say a
two-stage solution to the
Palestinians, do they say to themselves,
"Oh, no. We really want to own the whole
thing, so we want a one-state solution
where we're in
charge." Is that what they're thinking
when they answer the question? So, that
would be, you know, yet another reason
why you can't trust the polls on any of
this.
So, but here's what I do think. I I
think the opinions in the region would
be so far all over the place that if you
propose any kind of two-stage
solution that even the people who said
they were in favor of it would be
opposed to it because of the specific
way you said you wanted to do it. All
right. Two-state solution. But who's in
charge? where is it? Whi, you know,
which real estate are you talking about?
I don't think you could ever get much of
an agreement on that. So, I'm going to
I'm going to
assume that Trump will either stay away
from that question, as in this is your
problem, not mine. Uh, but I don't think
he's going to come out strong in favor
of a Palestinian two-state
solution. Just a guess. I don't think he
will. I could be
wrong. Well, as you
know, there was a what's being called a
top Iranian official, but really is an
adviser. He's well connected, but I
don't know if he's a top official. He
said that uh Iran would be willing to
make a deal with Trump in which there
would be some limits on their uranium
enrichment and there would be some
agreement not to make nuclear weapons
and there would be some kind of a
inspection to make sure that didn't
happen and they might destroy their
existing um yeah maybe maybe get rid of
some of their stockpiles but
uh I don't think that gets close to what
the US wants. So the US not only wants,
you know, something in the nuclear realm
as part of the deal, but they also want
Iran to stop supporting their terrorist
proxies, you know, Hamas and
Hezbollah. And uh I haven't seen that
even discussed. So would we make a deal
if they were going to just keep funding
Hamas? Doesn't feel like Trump
would. So, we're pretty far away on
that. And then uh uh Wititov recently
said that uh what the Trump
administration wants is a full
dismantlement of Tran Tan's uh nuclear
program. So that would include three
main nuclear facilities completely
dismantled. I think if I'm right, Thrron
wants to continue having the ability to
refine uranium, but they would keep
their refinement well under
the the level that uh you could make a
bomb and that there would be some
inspections on that. Now, I don't know
if that would ever be enough because it
would still leave them with the ability
to kind of
semi-rapidly change their mind and make
a bomb. And I don't think Trump's going
to live with that. So, Trump actually
said that uh there that there, you know,
important talks that are happening right
now and uh he had some he had some
optimism that uh maybe something will
happen. But the alternative that Trump
has laid out is that he will just turn
off uh oil sales from Iran. Now, right
now, Iran is still selling oil and you
know to China mostly. Um I I guess we
would embargo that or
uh stop those ships in the water or
something, but that would happen next if
we don't get a deal.
Uh, apparently oil prices have fallen in
part because of uh Trump's comments
about
Iran. And
uh so yeah, so if if oil prices fall,
that would also mean that Russia gets
less money to pursue their war. I don't
know if it'd make enough of a big deal
that Russia would want to make a deal,
but that's happening.
All right. Uh let's change the topic to
AI. So according to Fortune,
uh a bunch of CEOs are saying that only
a fraction of AI initiatives are
delivering a return on
investment. Now you know that I've
been more skeptical than most people
about what AI will ever be able to do.
And I've been skeptical that companies
will be able to use it in production
because I don't think they figured out
how to get rid of the hallucinating the
hallucinations and they don't know how
to make it reason yet, you know, and
figure out things that it hasn't
encountered before. It's just not good
at that.
So, so that seems to be a thing. Now, at
the same time that the CEOs are saying,
"hm, this has been a little
underwhelming, Meta, one of the big
players in AI." They've apparently
delayed their roll out of their flagship
AI model, the next level. And the
insiders are saying it's because they
don't think it is enough of an
improvement, and there's a lot of
insider fighting and stuff. So it's sort
of
suggesting and uh other people are
saying the same thing that AI might be
plateauing meaning that there will there
will always be you know new new models
coming out that are better than the last
one but they're not going to be twice as
good. You know the next one might be 3%
better. I'm just making that up. But
that would suggest that AI is reaching
its total
potential with the current technology.
So even if you build a a bigger data
center and you train it even harder,
there might not be that much extra that
it can go to. Now, if it's true that the
CEOs are saying it's underwhelming and
it's not really paying back and it's
also
plateauing, what is that telling you?
That's that would be some bad
news. Um, but then I see some uh big
breakthroughs that AI is doing. For
example, Google's deep mind AI is able
to come up with algorithms that humans
were not capable to come up
with. To which I say, wait a minute, are
you telling me that in the real world
benefit of
AI, the only thing they had to talk
about this week is that it could come up
with some algorithms that we couldn't
come up with. And then I say, what would
be those algorithms? And how how are
those changing the world? Well,
uh, Alpha Evolve, I guess that's the
flavor of AI that's doing this, um, came
up with more efficient algorithms for
several kinds of
computations. Several kinds, I say
several kinds, not just one, several
kinds. For example, it they came up with
a method for calculating
um that involve matrices that are a
better better method for calculating
matrices. Um and it's better than the
Strawson algorithm that has been relied
on for 56 years. So how good do you feel
about that?
I I tell you for 56 years I've been
relying on the Strawson algorithm to
calculate my matrices and the whole time
I was well there's got to be a better
way. Does anybody have a better and sure
enough AI came up with a better way to
calculate your
matrices better than the Strawson
algorithm. It improves the computational
efficiency by reducing the number of
calculations required to produce a
result.
So that's not
nothing. Does it feel to you like all
the little hints are suggesting that AI
may be reaching some kind of a limit
that we weren't expecting?
Now the next level of AI, you know,
where it's uh super AI and AGI and all
the whatever we're thinking is that next
level. That really depends on us
inventing things we don't know how to
invent
yet. How long does it take to invent
something we don't know how to invent?
Remember I told you the day that the
estimate for when we would have humanoid
robots that could live in your house and
you just tell it, "Oh, I've got a new
task for you. Uh, you've never done this
before, but here's how you feed the
dog." And then it would just watch you
do it. And I go, "Oh, okay." We're not
really close to that because you've
never seen that even demonstrated, have
you?
Let let me give you the
demonstration of apparently what is the
best our current AI can make a robot
do. If you're just listening to this,
this is me dancing like a like a
 Jazz hands.
Do you think it's a coincidence that
every time we see a demo, it's doing
something that you wouldn't need at all?
Are are you going to buy the dancing
robot or uh the robot that can do uh
back
somersaults or the one that can carry a
a predetermined size box into a
predetermined size place and not much
else? Um and and then you saw, you know,
some estimates that maybe it'll be 2 or
3 years before you buy a humanoid robot
that can just do stuff around the house.
Two or three years doesn't suggest that
we have current technology that can do
it. That that's not just tweaking it for
two or three years until it works. That
really depends on inventing something
that we haven't invented.
So, I'm uh I'm pretty skeptical on this
whole AI thing. I think we may have we
may be approaching a plateau, but you
know, that could change in a minute if
somebody's invented something
new. Well, are you
uh are you watching the Supreme Court
conversations?
Um, let me try to explain the Supreme
Court situation because, you know,
you're not all lawyers and you don't
have the deep understanding of law and
the Supreme Court the way I do, you
know, with my complete lack of
experience in that
domain. But apparently
somehow, oh, let me just say this in
case you can't pick up the sarcasm.
There's nothing I say about the Supreme
Court that you should
trust. It's really complicated at the
moment. So, apparently there are two
questions. Birthright
citizenship and then the universal
injunction thing. That's the thing where
a federal judge who in theory would be
in charge of, you know, some small part
of the country would make some kind of
ruling that says the entire country
can't do this thing. Now, it's been
applied to a lot of the executive orders
from Trump. So, all you need to do is
get some lefty judge to say, "Oh, yeah.
Uh, I I give you an injunction so that
nowhere in the country can you do that."
And then of course the people who are
normal say why can this one judge who's
only in charge of this little slice of
the country tell the entire rest of the
country what it can and can't
do. Now both of these questions you'd
think would be good questions for the
Supreme
Court. But for reasons I don't fully
understand. The only way to get it in
there was to to jam them together and
talk about how birthright citizenship
have been blocked with an universal
injunctive
relief. So, it would cause the Supreme
Court to have to deal with both
issues in ways I don't quite understand.
So, I listened to a bunch of the
arguments. I didn't understand a damn
thing I heard. Did anybody have the same
experience? You know, some of you might
be lawyers, so you understood it. But I
didn't understand any of it. And I don't
understand how they can just staple
these two staple these two items
together and take them both to the
Supreme Court and expect that you're
going to get some kind of answer to them
individually. Don't get it at all.
Absolutely baffled by the whole thing.
But the smart people, the people who
know way more than I do and uh Politico
has some writing by Josh Gerstein and
Hassan Ali
Kanu. Um they're saying that the the
birthright part is getting a frosty
reception, meaning that don't expect the
Supreme Court to come up with any ruling
that says that birthight citizenship
will go away or be limited. So it looks
like maybe both the lefty and the righty
parts of the Supreme Court are just
saying, "Hey, we got president. We got
clear writing in the Constitution. We're
not going to change
it." But the situation of the uh
judges that are making these broad um
rulings that affect the whole country,
there does seem to be some wiggle room
on that one.
So, we don't know. You know, it's too
early to know how anybody's going to
vote, but there's a possibility that
when they're all done, nothing about um
birthray citizenship, which is you get
to be a citizen if you're born in this
country, probably nothing about that
will change.
But the idea that a judge can, you know,
a federal judge in one part of the
country can do something that affects
the whole rest of the
country. There might be some changes
coming in that domain, but that's uh
that's speculative at this
point. Well, as you know, Trump's big
beautiful bill is getting ready for the
prime time. They're they're still
marking it up and playing with it, but
basically they've uh got the bill kind
of close and uh I think Trump's kind of
happy with it. But Ran Paul says uh
quote, "It will be a record for Congress
to raise the debt $5
trillion, but also it indicates that
this year the deficit will be over two
trillion, but it means they're
anticipating close to three trillion for
the next year.
So, so Ran Paul is questioning the
raising the debt ceiling by 5 trillion
and
uh so yeah and especially in the context
of Doge was supposed to save us all this
money but we don't see anything like
that. We don't see anything that looks
like a Doge saving. Where is it? What
happened to it? Did we go through all
that for nothing?
Um, and uh, Paul says, he summarizes it
by saying, "It's really a slap in the
face at those of us who were excited
about Elon Musk and Doge and all the
cuts." Well, that's me. That's me. I was
excited about Elon Musk and Doge and all
the cuts, and I consider this bill a
slap in my
face. I feel
insulted. Literally insulted.
Um, and let me let me just put it this
way. Congress had one thing that they
had to get
right. We'd like them to get everything
right, but they had one thing
they needed to get right, which is not
to spend us into a certain death. And
those
 Republicans, I'm only
talking about you Republicans. You
 came up with a bill that
will spend us into oblivion. And you
 know it. You know it.
And you're doing it right in front of
our faces. Am I insulted?
Yes. Can I support Republicans when
they're doing this? Right to our face.
No. No. you. I'm out. I am so out.
You need to at least put a little effort
into it. Don't try to shove this up our
 asses one more time. Do Do you
think you didn't get the message that
the public is done with this? We're so
done with this. Go back. Take five or
10% off or whatever you need to do. It's
going to
hurt. Here's the problem.
We have a goal which is to have fiscal
responsibility. But we don't have a
system that can ever get that for us
because the problem is that if any
politician cut anything enough to make a
difference, they would not get
reelected. So we shouldn't be surprised
that the people who are in the system
that they will be punished to do the
right thing. They will be punished. They
will be punished if they do the right
thing, which is cut the spending. They
will be punished. Even if they take
something that only 10% of the public
cares about, that's enough not to get a
reelected. They would be punished. So,
as long as we have a system that
guarantees we're going to go down the
drain, don't ask me to sign off on this.
Don't ask me to pat you on the
head. Don't ask me to say, "Good job,
guys." No, this is an
insult. This is an
insult. Rand Paul, I'm on your
side. And I feel like the public just
has to take over this
process. I feel like the
public needs to just say, "We're going
to get rid of
everybody unless you can fix this." Now,
I don't know any way that that can work,
but I'll tell you one thing. The
Congress can't do this thing, and it's
the most important thing. And if
you can't do the most important
thing to keep us all alive, to keep us
alive, you got to
go. Something's got to change.
And am I happy with President Trump, who
apparently seems to be perfectly happy
with kicking this can down the road at
the age of whatever he is?
Nope. Absolutely
not. No. I I can tell you that Trump did
amazing work in the Middle East. I I
think really just historically amazing
work. But if he gives us this
budget, how am I supposed to support
that? And it doesn't have anything to do
with a Republican or Democrat. It's
doom. It's the end of your
life. Unless somebody's come up with
some magical way that everything will be
better. The the only thing I saw that
was like this glimmer of hope was
somebody in the comments on X said well
you know nothing about the budget will
matter when AI reaches you know this
certain level AI will change everything
so so debt won't matter etc
really is is that why the uh the Fortune
500 companies say hm this AI isn't
working out so
much you're going to have to give us
some kind of a plan that doesn't look
like you're going to kill
us. And this is absolutely a
non-starter. So, every one of you
 you got something to explain to
the public. You've insulted us. You've
failed. You've set us on a track to
absolute
destruction. And you'd better
figure it out.
Now again, I do have some sympathy for
the fact that they're in a system where
they will be personally punished for
doing the right
thing. I feel like the
public or or maybe it's Trump. I mean,
you know, he he's a singular character.
He could he could do
it. I just don't know that he
would. I I think that it's political
suicide to cut any part of the budget
for any any reason whatsoever. Just
absolute
suicide. So, I don't know where this
goes, but don't expect me to be
mindlessly supporting Republicans when
they're trying to kill us all. That
That's not going to happen. That's just
not going to happen.
Well, not only are they trying to take
away all of our money and destroy the
country, but uh now Senator Mike Lee,
Republican,
uh he wants to make porn a crime in the
United States. So all pornography would
be u basically become a
crime. Now my first question about this
was would that include only
fans? Would the Only Fans be able to
still do their Only Fans
thing? Because if you got rid of all
sort of classic
porn, wouldn't men turn more to Only
Fans? And wouldn't that turn women more
into prostitutes
online? I don't know. I would worry a
little bit about the unintended
consequences of this one. you know, I
don't know enough about it, but
um I don't know. It look it also looks
like a limitation on free speech and
everything else. So, you can have your
opinion on that.
um US wholesale uh prices. So the
according to the Daily Wire, so US
wholesale prices had the biggest decline
in 5
years, flying in the face of economist
predictions. At the same time, the news
is saying that Walmart's getting ready
to raise their prices substantially
because of tariffs. So if you're not,
you're wellversed in economics, how can
it be true that Walmart's going to raise
its prices at the same time, which would
be the signal for everybody else to do
it really? Uh at the same time that
we've seen the biggest drop in 5 years.
And the answer is there's a timing
difference. So the the tariff stuff
hasn't really hit the economy yet and we
don't know how big it will be. But uh
nothing that has happened so far is
predictive of what will happen over the
summer. And the news is pretending it
is. The news is pretending that that uh
because there's some kind of weird
disconnect between the Trump tariff uh
action and the fact that prices are
actually going down. I think the news is
trying to convince you that there won't
be a connection because there hasn't
been a connection so far. That is not
true. There is a timing difference. We
might see some further decreases in
prices, but when the tariffs start
kicking in over the summer, it's only
going to go in one
direction. Now, it could be that the
Walmarts are the ones where the prices
happen. Maybe we won't see it in some
bigger areas like tech and stuff like
that.
Maybe. But don't be confused. If
Walmart's getting ready to raise prices
and they've announced it, prices are
going up.
Um, according to Politico, Joe Biden uh
probably cost the Democrats the White
House in
2024 through his feebleness and his
insistence of being in the race anyway,
but now they're thinking that he's going
to uh completely hobble them in
2028. Uh, I'm going to push back on a
little this. So, Politico's the writing
is from Adam Bran and Holly
Otterbine. Um, and I guess they're
talking about the fact that the
Democrats are still not coming clean
about the fact that they were running a
candidate who was mentally incompetent.
And if they don't come clean on that and
find some way to deal with it
productively, it might hang over them
all the way to
2028. I'm not so sure.
because 2028 is so far away that we're
going to have a whole bunch of other
things to think about. And I was I was
watching the news yesterday and have you
had this experience yet? It'll be a
podcast or a news show and they're just
saying the same thing about Biden over
and over. Well, they should have known.
Well, the tapper book is really just
trying to give the press some kind of
ounce. Well, certainly the insiders
knew. Why didn't the insiders tell us?
And it's all the same. Now, I don't
believe that the political right and
their podcasters slash newspapeople, I
don't think they can keep telling that
same freaking story for four more years,
can they? Three more years.
So, even as powerful as that story is, I
only kind of see it from the Republican
side and then the Democrats are like,
"Okay, you know, you got a pretty good
point there." But I don't think it's got
three years of
legs. I I think it'll be based on how
Trump did for the next three years and
based the economy does.
I just don't know that that's got the
legs to make a difference in 2028, but
we'll see. Um, at the moment, the books
coming out are driving the headlines.
And there will probably be some more
books, and they will sort of all be the
same. Oh, here's another insider who
says that he noticed something was wrong
with Biden. We know that. There's
nothing new.
Um, but uh, Governor Whitmer was on CNN.
So, here's another example. So, even CNN
is trying to get people to admit that
they knew. But CNN is doing the trick
where if they can get you to think that
the problem was the Biden insiders were
lying, then you won't notice that CNN is
uh didn't somehow pick up on the fact
that you could tell just by looking at
Biden in public. Fox News knew it. How
did Fox News know that Biden was
mentally
incompetent? And uh probably 70 million
Republicans could tell every time they
saw him in
public and and CNN's trying to paper
over that essentially change history.
They're trying to rewrite history. So
the problem was not their observational
skills, which was the real problem.
Well, it wasn't even their observational
skills. it was her willingness to say
they
noticed.
Um, so Whitmer was
asked, you know, since she was very
involved in the uh campaign,
um, you know, if she didn't notice
Biden's decline, and she said, "I was
busy working. I didn't see the president
directly." Are they going to really get
away with
that? that that all these people who are
working on behalf of the president
didn't really spend much time with him.
Yeah, I didn't really see him
much. I can't blame me. But again,
they're trying to make it look like you
couldn't tell every time he was in
public.
So yeah. Anyway,
um so there's a story about
uh a Soros Foundation director.
So, this is somebody who's literally the
director of the Soros Foundation, like I
just said, who uh who sort of admitting
according to the national pulse that uh
the NOS's were using a lawfare to
protect illegals against public wishes.
And so this uh fellow Greg uh Maniatis
the director at the George Soros
Foundation was saying that uh the sort
of the activities of his organization
um created chaos at the border. Now the
reason I found this story
interesting is that he's using the word
chaos to describe what they had created.
He said, quote, "Chaos is the defining
story of failure among progressives."
Uh, Manny Addis said, pinpointing the
refusal of Democratic leaders to address
a quote chaotic border system,
particularly over the last decade.
Is it
possible that the Democrats use of chaos
as their their one big word against
Trump, is it possible now that the word
has
just become normalized to the point
where they're using it against
themselves? You know, it seems like the
Democrats are now competing to see who
can say the worst thing about
Democrats, right? because there's a
little bit of competition of who could
be the most honest about knowing that
Biden was mentally
incompetent. But now there's further
competition to say, "Oh god, we were bad
about that border." Yeah, you got I got
to admit, we sure were bad about the
border. And they're even using their own
code word
chaos. I don't know. It struck me that
that was
fun. I saw a story that at first I
thought was terrible, but maybe it
isn't. Um, Governor Nuome of California
in his uh new budget, he's calling for
closing yet another prison in
California, which would be the fifth one
that would have been closed during the
Biden or the Nuome administration.
Now, when you hear that he's going to
close five prisons or or close the fifth
one, four have already been closed.
Doesn't that suggest to you that he's
letting criminals
out or or that somehow they'll just let
the criminals run free and not put them
in prison? Well,
maybe. But his argument is that crime is
down and they just don't need it. Is
that possible?
Do you think crime is actually down and
falling and that it's falling at a
predictable enough rate that he can
close another
prison? That would be kind of awesome.
Do you think it would have anything to
do with closing the
border?
Yes. So, it might be that closing the
border, although I doubt that had
anything to do with the first four that
he closed. It could be that closing the
border has a predictable effect on crime
that the governor of California is
saying, you know what, we might have too
many
prisons. I don't know if they're
connected yet, so I'm just
speculating. Well, because Democrats uh
can't they they seem to be unable to do
anything right in terms of messaging. Uh
now some Democratic lawmakers are
pushing hard again for
reparations. So uh Representative Summer
Lee, Democrat Pennsylvania, she's going
to reintroduce uh and this had been
first introduced in 2023 by Cy Bush, but
they're going to reintroduce some
reparations
um ideas and
uh trying to make up for all those bad
things in the past. What do you think
about that? Do do you think that uh the
thing that will help the Democrats uh in
the midterms and in 2028 will be their
push for
reparations? I I'd love to see uh James
Carville's opinion about that. Paging
James Carville. Do you think this is the
time to talk about
reparations? Do do you think they seized
the moment just right?
I'm seeing something online. It's not a
big trend
yet, but it's going under the tag of
uh black fatigue. Is that it? Black. Do
I have that right? Black fatigue. But
it's the idea that just people are
getting tired of listening to uh black
specific
problems. And it does feel to me like
this isn't the right moment for that.
And you know, my take on it is I used to
be um extra interested in black American
problems most my adult life under the
theory that if you could help the people
who are in the deepest hole,
uh that would be the best thing for the
country. So if you could take somebody
somebody from can't get a job to got a
job or can't get into college to got
into college or doesn't have a good
education to got a good
education that you get enormous
benefits, you know, better than if
somebody got a 10% raise at the job they
already had. So my thinking was, well,
it just makes sense. I mean, it just
makes sense that you would focus in that
area because that's where the the
deepest problem is. You reverse that,
you really get some some good societal
gains. But I'm just so tired of
it all. And now I just think everybody's
got
problems. There's nobody with special
problems. And so when I hear any group
saying, "I've got special problems and
you should give me some money." I just
think I'm bored and I don't care. You're
boring me and I don't care. Do they have
a point? I don't care. Do they have a a
good historical argument
for
reparations? I don't care because
everybody's got a good argument for why
they should get some extra, too. So do
I. I I've been discriminated against for
50 years. Do you care? No. Well, you
don't care. Why should I care about
anybody
else? So, no. Uh, I have I have some
kind of fatigue. Don't care. But I think
James Carville will be funny if he
weighs in on this because if the
Democrats don't have anything that's
working, that's the worst time to throw
this into the
mix. It's just not going to get you any
extra votes.
Well, according to
uh the news, um the the EU is going to
put new sanctions on Russia because
Putin skipped that peace talks in
Turkey. So, poor little Zalinski
um went down to Turkey and he thought he
was going to meet with Putin and then
Putin just ghosted
him, which to me is funny. It's funny
that he ghosted him, but then, you know,
he sent some low-level people and then
they all said, "Well, this is
worthless." So, they just already ended
the meeting. Um, Trump has said that
he's already he's ready to meet with
Putin to try to work things out, but
apparently the EU is going to put some
extra sanctions on
Russia. So, we'll see if that makes any
difference.
Um, but it does suggest that the Trump
approach of making all wars commercial
wars, you know, he if you want to be
part of the world commercial system, you
better stop your physical
wars. Um, but we'll see if Trump can get
something done there. In other news,
Newsmax is reporting that uh Health and
Human Services is going to stop advising
COVID shots for kids and pregnant women.
To which I said to myself, wait, they
were still advising
that? Are any of you surprised that they
were still advising
that? You don't have to be a doctor to
know that that was a bad idea. You just
have to be a little bit aware of the
news. My god, really? and and they
haven't stopped yet that they've just
announced that they're going to How
about just get this
done? How about just saying pick up the
phone or write a memo or sign an
executive order? How about stopping it
right now? Why are you going to wait a
week?
Jesus. All right, got a little worked up
today. That's all I got for you today.
see if you can embarrass your Republican
representatives into doing their job for
the first time ever. Um, see what we can
do. I don't have a good idea there.
Maybe you do. Maybe AI or
something. Uh, but I'm going to talk uh
privately to the people on locals. If
you're on Rumble or YouTuber X, thanks
for joining and I will see you again
same time, same place tomorrow.
and locals coming at you privately.
