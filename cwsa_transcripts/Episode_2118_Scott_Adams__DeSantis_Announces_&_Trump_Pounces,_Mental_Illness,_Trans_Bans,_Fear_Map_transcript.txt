do do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization today
featuring I know hold on
electricity yeah yeah today we're going
to do the show with electricity see if
that keeps the lights on for a little
bit longer and if you'd like to take
your experience up to levels that have
never been experienced before well all
you need is a cupboard of glass I take
your chalices iron against yoga flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine for the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous separate happens now
ah
surprisingly delicious
oh that's good stuff
all right I'd like to begin by uh
putting you all into tech support for a
moment
does anybody else have the experience
lately and I can't tell if it's an
internet problem or a Scott problem
that your internet is working fine
you can test and there's plenty of
signal but some of the main websites you
go to just stop working in the afternoon
does anybody had that problem
is there something like oh okay yes okay
a lot of yeses
I thought I was crazy
for example my my internet can be
blazing at you know several hundred
megabits per second and I can check it
at the same time the Instagram isn't
working
and then I'll go to Twitter I'm like ah
Instagram isn't working I'll go over to
Twitter and Twitter won't work
so that I'll say well check my Gmail
and it won't work
and it can last for hours
so you're all having the same problem
right a number of you having this
problem
is there some kind of common
how could there be a common element to
any of that
there must be something common
well I don't know what it is all right
well I'm glad it's not just me but there
are times in the afternoon where I can't
use my internet at all
and here's the weird thing
my 5G stops at the same time
I don't know what's going on so I always
think oh my my internet's not working
I'll switch over to my 5G it goes down
the same time all the time I don't know
why
all right
if you're not watching the new Dilbert
reborn comic available only to
subscribers here on locals or if you if
you subscribe on Twitter you only get
the comic
and uh Dilbert is still trying to deal
with his new Karen 3000 AI sex bot
and I will just summarize by saying it's
still not going well it's not going well
I saw today a visual illusion that
mirrors the Yanni and Laurel you know
the audio illusion where some people
here uh Yani and some people here at
Laurel
you've probably seen on the internet
that that illusion has been expanded
you can have a list of something like 10
different sentences
that if you're reading the sentence the
audio that's always the same sounds like
the sentence you're reading and then you
go down to the next sentence and the
audio instantly changes in your mind but
not in reality in reality it's always
the same but in your mind it changes to
exactly the next sentence which has
nothing to do with the sentence above it
and then you can repeat that nine times
every sentence you read completely
different sentences the audio instantly
changes to the sentence you're reading
now if that didn't freak you out enough
you can do that with visual stuff as
well so I I tweeted if you want to see
it there's a visual illusion where if
you concentrate at a dot in the center
sometimes you see green sometimes you
see purple and sometimes all the dots
disappear and turn into one Green Dot
and all of it is based on
kind of wanting to see it you just
concentrated one place in in the entire
visual field changes while you watch it
now if that doesn't tell you
that you've always been living in a
complete subjective bubble of reality
that your bubble in my bubble do not
match
you should yeah I mean that's about the
best evidence you could ever have that
we don't live in the same worlds with
each other we're we're imagining that
the other has experienced something like
we're imagining but is Pure Imagination
your little world of mine so different
and we'll never know we'll never know
all right
um
yesterday uh if you were watching from
if you're watching my show from YouTube
you knew that the video crapped out just
because I didn't have my iPad charged up
enough
um
and you missed the big reveal
I promised you that I was going to show
that Carrie Lakes challenge in Arizona
which said that the signature matching
had obviously not been done or at least
not done well
because the claim was that 274
000 signatures were matched
or at least you know looked at for a
match
in two seconds
and I claimed that I could do that right
in front of you 274
000 signature matches
and I'm going to do it in less than two
seconds do you believe I can do it
well
if I remember on this board are two
signatures
and I'd like to demonstrate uh that I
can I could do a signature match in
under two seconds
uh it takes a little stretching it's not
something you can do right away
let's see if I can get this
all right
you can set the timer set the timer for
two seconds I'm going to turn around
quickly and see if I can do a signature
match
how was it was that under two seconds
um
they do not match
they do not match
how would I do
pretty good wasn't it
I'm pretty sure I got that in a little
under one second
maybe a little over one second but two
seconds was plenty
I had plenty of time
now you might be confused because I said
I was going to do 274
000 of them in two seconds
did I say that
this was the new set didn't it didn't
the news say that there were 274 000 in
two seconds well not really no not
really what the news said was
per signature match
two seconds per signature match which I
just proved I just did it in less than
two seconds
now of course that doesn't answer all
the questions
I'm really just mocking the quality of
the news all right so I'm not making any
real point about the election itself I'm
just mad at the news for telling you
that what what that really meant was all
274 000 happened in two seconds
it was two seconds each which is plenty
of time
now here's the part I don't know
how do you do a signature match
do you have do you have to Fumble around
and find two things before you do the
match
or do they or are they presented to you
on a screen and you just look at them
because if they're presented to you on
the screen let's say in a column where
all you're doing is seeing if this one
matches this one you can just take your
finger and run right down the page
couldn't you
is it on the screen are you looking at
it on two pieces of paper that you have
to like
fuss with and find the two pieces of
paper
does anybody know how that works
it's on the screen somebody says
if the two signatures are on the screen
next to each other
you can do that in two seconds pretty
easily
that's not even a challenge
because they're not looking for exact
they're not looking for oh that you
dotted your eye differently they're
looking for like massively different
signatures or like one's missing or
something you know they're not looking
for small differences
am I wrong about that
I don't think I'm wrong
anyway so this is more a comment about
the quality of the news coverage
it's not a statement in any way about
whether the election was fair or not
fair I have no idea
right
um so that's what you missed
uh let's see so as you know uh
tonight uh DeSantis announces
and Trump
pounces yeah all right you can save for
that for a minute
DeSantis announces and Trump pounces we
have both stories so descendants is
going to go on the audio service on
Twitter called spaces and is going to do
an unscripted interview which exposes
the only kind you should do an
unscripted interview where the Elon Musk
do you think Elon Musk is going to get
any uh pushback
for having this anticon
oh of course because it's Elon Musk and
its politics and his DeSantis and all
that so we must find reasons to hate it
reason number one to hate it Twitter has
become a right-wing Echo chamber
right
except that musk has on Twitter said
that he'd love to interview Biden as
well
so there's your right wing Echo chamber
the guy who's being blamed for being
biased
literally open to any of the major
candidates talking to him I'm sure now
he didn't say anything about Trump
but what do you say no
I don't know it's a good question you
might he might actually because there
are competitors on Truth versus uh
Twitter but we'll see
however I think I love I love everything
about it I think DeSantis is smart
to do it this way
because it makes news
so so DeSantis gets to make news twice
once because he's announcing and twice
because he's doing it in a in a way that
is newsworthy
that's good technique I'm going to give
DeSantis some compliments
he he does consistently find the free
money
right the the little things that his
base likes
and uh this is just one of those little
extra there's just a little extra for
this right anybody can announce for
presidency several people have done it
already and it's usually boring
I don't think there's anything less
boring
than having an unscripted conversation
with Elon Musk where he gets to ask the
questions what could be less boring than
that
that's pretty good so DeSantis uh a plus
for uh announcement technique
however when DeSantis announces Trump
pounces and so he had a little screed
today about it in which he called Ron uh
to sanctimonious now he's shortened it
to Ron Des Sanctus
now I
I cannot hide the fact
that Trump's technique makes me giggle
and he's done this before right he's
announced a nickname but then he's later
shortened the nickname he's abbreviated
it I think it's another he gets another
hit for the abbreviation
so now I guess he's abbreviating it to
disinct us and these are the claims that
Trump makes now these are political
claims
so you know use your judgment about the
the truth of any of this right it's all
out of context stuff so you know I'm not
claiming any this is true
if it were to be considered in context
so he says that DeSantis voted to cut
Social Security and degrade Medicare and
he wanted to introduce US 23 sales tax
increase and these are he's a rhino who
Paul Ryan likes and he's a disloyal
person and so so Trump is basically just
emptying the you know empty of the clip
he said what do we got
bring me the entire list
I'm going to do I'm going to do one
announcement I'll just throw everything
in there see what it sticks uh but my
favorite was Trump said that about
DeSantis he desperately needs a
personality transplant and to the best
of my knowledge they are not medically
available yet
now
am I wrong
that that Trump is one of the best humor
writers
in our age it's just the way he chooses
his words
because it would be one thing to say he
needs a trans a personality transplant
right if you say somebody needs a
personality transplant that would be
sort of innovative and might get a
little news right but most people would
stop there
oh it is a he needs a personality
transplant but what does Trump
consistently do what technique does
Trump use
say it
say it he gives attention of course
now there's more it's the most obvious
thing he does
say it
he makes you think past the sale
right here he did it again the sale is
that uh
the DeSantis needs a personality
transplant so that that's what he's
trying to sell you that he has a boring
personality now
can you imagine any other candidate
uh focusing on somebody's boringness
as a political attack
because if you saw this out of context
you'd say to yourself perhaps and I
think I think even musk said something
like this that you want you'd like a
boring president for a while
you know a boring president might be
exactly what we need how about a
president with no personality whatsoever
I could go for that right now right so
there are a lot of people who would say
well that's not even that's not even an
insult
like why would you focus on his
personality when it's the least
important part of the process
and the answer is because it works
that's it
Trump knows what other politicians don't
know that people do vote based on what
they think will be more fun
I know I do
I am absolutely conscious of the fact
completely conscious of the fact that
I'm biased by what would be more fun or
funnier or just more interesting and he
knows it he knows that if he's more fun
people are going to vote for him
I'm sure that helped zielinski do you
think zelenski won because he was more
fun probably
probably that and nothing else probably
zielinski only won because it was more
fun it doesn't seem like it at the
moment but I imagine they thought so
so anyway
um and then the claims he makes Are all
uh and the context for example the sales
tax increase to 23 percent if you hear
that and a context
doesn't it sound like Ron DeSantis wants
to raise your taxes
because at one time he said 23 sales tax
no now I don't have to do any research
I've done no research on this to know
that that was in the context of lowering
your other taxes
did I guess right I'm just guessing
but I'm guessing that Ron DeSantis never
suggested keeping all your other taxes
the same and raising your sales tax to
23 percent
you know that never happened right you
don't have to research that
of course it never happened yeah he was
probably in the context probably in the
context of a total tax overhaul that
would result in lower taxes or something
more efficient and I'm not saying it was
a good idea or a bad idea
I'm just saying it wasn't this it wasn't
just keeping everything the same and
raising your sales tax
so you know it's a very political
trump-like
um set of
set of complaints
all right so but I will give Trump
credit for one thing in particular he
can you do a fact check on me here I'm
not sure I'm going to pass the fact
check on this but my understanding is
just based on memory
that Trump has been pretty consistent
about not cutting benefits for seniors
especially you know Medicare and Social
Security am I right about that I believe
he's been completely consistent about
backing seniors
yeah and then so that's a strong attack
because if DeSantis has ever wavered on
that and thought Oh we need a you know a
grand deal to balance the budget which
is not a bad idea
you know I'm not I wouldn't criticize it
if somebody came up with an idea that
did maybe shave off a little bit from
Social Security and Medicare
but had the benefit of saving the
country because you know we get out of
her death spiral
that's something you'd want to talk
about
but if you see that in a context it just
sounds like a big old you know tax
raising
benefit cutting guy
all right so I don't know if this attack
made any difference but I love the fact
that he he mentioned the personality
transplant and here's the part we make
sure you think past the sale
to the best of my knowledge they are not
medically available yet it actually
makes you think about whether it's
possible
which is the hilarious part it's like
well wait a minute he's actually talking
about this like maybe it's possible
all right
so Vanity Fair which used to be a
respectable publication some people say
has devolved into just a ridiculous
parody of itself
and
they had uh so there was an article
today that had two headline uh in it one
of the headlines was
that DeSantis is going to announce on uh
on Twitter because quote David Duke
wasn't available
that's right Vanity Fair actually says
in a headline that DeSantis will be
announcing his presidency with Elon Musk
because David Duke wasn't available
and then they doubled down in the same
article later saying uh
um
oh no it was somewhere else but there
was another another similar uh
accusation
and
oh what else is that and other Neo-Nazi
sympathizers weren't available
now I'm starting to have a whole
different feeling about Democrats now
like the the writer of this article
I think we'd all agree that at some
level in the Democrat you know power
hierarchy they know they're doing things
just for politics in other words they
don't believe their own messaging they
just know that it works similar to Trump
right he doesn't believe his own
messaging but he knows it works
um
so
here's what I'm starting to feel
when I say people like the writer of
this Vanity Fair I don't know that this
writer is part of the Democrat power
structure
or is it somebody who has induced mental
illness
because the hitlerization of the
Democrats where they see Hitler
everywhere because the media is
hypnotize them basically to see Hitler
you know in their closet and under the
bed
that to me reads as mental illness now
it could be a temporary form of it you
know something that passes when the news
passes to another form but at the moment
I I don't see it as a political opinion
do you
do you see that as politics it doesn't
look like that at all it looks like
mental illness to me and I'm not saying
that
for a hyperbolic I'm I'm intentionally
trying to not exaggerate here my actual
impression of it is I only see it as
mental illness now does anybody else
have that yet are you seeing it that way
are you still seeing it as politics
now I don't know if there's a version of
that that works the other way
do you think that Democrats have a view
that there's some stuff that Republicans
are doing that's not based on their
actual opinions or politics but rather
on some kind of mental illness
they would say that about religion right
yeah so so some Democrats non-religious
Democrats some of them might say
uh the the right is crazy because of
their belief in God
but that but I think we're well beyond
the point
where somebody's religious belief is
considered a mental illness
right there's nobody in the medical
community who would say that at least
for the the standard religions yeah I
think the medical view is that people
have different filters on life and if
you you pick this particular religious
filter it's more of a lifestyle
lifestyle preference and can be very
good for you
would you compare somebody who who
believed in let's say a specific
religion and let's say you don't believe
that's a true religion that's your
opinion
is that mental illness if somebody picks
a religion that gives them a good
guideline for living their life in a
healthy way
to me if that's if if if religion is a
mental illness
you're gonna have to show me where it's
hurting people
you're gonna have to show me that the
negative is greater than the positive
because my observation this is just you
know anecdotal but my observation is
that religious people do better
they have happier lives they're less
mental illness you know more success
more satisfaction live longer
right to me to me the benefits of having
a religious Faith are somewhat
unambiguous I mean it just seems obvious
to me now I don't and I'm saying that as
someone who is not a believer
so I think that gives me some
credibility wouldn't you say
because if I were a Believer and I said
oh yeah believing is the healthy thing
to do well then you'd have to say you
know that's confirmation bias but I'm
giving you something that's the opposite
of my confirmation my confirmation is
I'm not a believer
I'm not my choice
I'm not a non-believer by choice it's
just where I ended up right it's just
where I am I don't choose it
so if I could choose
I would choose to have a religious faith
that would be my that would be my
rational choice if I could choose
but I can't I just my brain doesn't have
that capacity I guess
so I'm not sure I'd call that a mental
illness if it's making you healthier and
more successful and gives you meaning
and all that stuff
but if you see Hitler under the bed how
is that helping you
it's not that's just mental illness
so that's going to be my take I think
for the the rest of the cycle is I'm
going to try to make a distinction
between what is political attack such as
Trump making you know tax and benefit
related claims about DeSantis that's
clearly not mental illness would you
agree
a politician just claiming the other one
has bad policies even if it's a lie it's
not mental illness it's just how they
play that game
all right
but the I think we need a name for this
seeing Hitler everywhere it's like
hitlerization or
that's not quite it
but something that yeah TDS didn't get
it done
Trump derangement syndrome is uh too
non-specific I'm looking for something
that's more specific to the the racist
um narrative
godwinization too clever
Hitler haunting Hitler under the bed
how about Hitler under the bed
does that work
you you got the Hitler under the bed
disease
that kind of works it's very visual
isn't it
is Visual and it's absurd so it kind of
works
bedtime for Hitler too long yeah it is
too long
all right
as you know if you're following the news
there is something like I'm going to
call it a trans backlash
so entities that are pushing back
against trans activism
Etc
so adding to that list is Montana
it's the first state to ban people
dressed in drag from reading books to
children at public schools and libraries
is that too far
that feels too far
now I'm not in favor just to be clear
I'm not in favor of
uh of people reading to children
if the reading to Children is also
coming with a political message
so just to be clear
I'm not really I'm not crazy about
um the men dressed well how do they say
it
uh they say people dressed in drag that
right so they don't say it in the
impolite way so they don't say men they
say people dressed in drag
um
I'm not in favor of people dressed in
drag reading to school children
but I don't know if banning it
is quite the right approach I don't have
a better idea
just to be clear I don't have a good
idea for this but I'm not sure that
it feels like a little too much
does anybody have that reaction or is it
just me
if somebody says jail
no let's just be it right I'm the only
one having this reaction
yeah because there's there's
we always have to walk this balance
between over regulating everything
and protecting children
so if you if on this one you fell on the
side of protecting children I'd be okay
with that I mean I wouldn't complain
about that instinct I I just feel like
it's sort of an expensive way to do it
you know just over it's a little over
regulating but I get it I get it I guess
I don't I'm not opposed to it
it just I wish there was some other way
to get the job done
all right but here I'm useless because I
have no no good ideas for this so I'll
just point out that there seems to be
some kind of a backlash coming
likewise uh Target I saw a target a
story about Target and the boycott there
because apparently Target was selling
some
trans related clothing for children
right
was that the story
it was trans specific chilled clothing
for children so there was a complaint
about that I saw a tweet about it that
pointed to an article in the hill
but by the time I clicked on it the
article was gone
is that because something about the
story changed
did the hill maybe get a fact check
wrong
so there's something about the story I
don't understand because it it kind of
came and went and
maybe it's because some of the facts
were wrong
anyway the only part that I think we
know is that targets giving pressure
to uh to change their approach
so that is yet another again another
example of I'll call it a trans backlash
now as you know
I'm a
pro-lgbtq pro-trans
for adults
for adults yeah and the kit issue is
that's a whole other topic but for
adults I'm you know live your life do
what you need to do
Etc
but I would also say that the trans
um let's say messaging or persuasion
was overdone
is that fair
you know can I can I be unambiguously
pro-trans because I'm pro-human beings
pro-human beings like that gets you
everything right adults they're
following the law you follow the law
you're good with me you know you stay
off my lawn
you're good with me I don't ask of any
anything else of you so you know if you
could put up with me I can certainly put
up with your differences of whatever
um
but I think the messaging was overdone
it was just overdone yeah I think
surprisingly I think more people were
already there
that the trans Community was weirdly
accepted from the start in my opinion
I mean haven't you all and you've been
you've encountered trans people probably
your whole adult life
did it ever matter to you at all
like did they ever hurt you
have you ever been beaten up by a trans
person
the trans people raise your taxes do
they try to take away your rights I mean
it was sort of a non-problem
but then then I think things
went maybe a little bit too far
so there's a little bit of adjustment
going on
um I saw one interesting
Theory and it was somebody talking about
what they thought James Lindsay's belief
was so there was mind reading involved
so I don't want to blame James Lindsay
for what I'm going to talk about because
it was some other person talking about
his opinion
it's just it's just such an interesting
idea I wanted to raise it
so you remember that the summer of
George Floyd
uh was a big narrative Builder
you know it's the country is racist and
all the white people are white
supremacists
and but that that messaging is starting
to where where thin
it's starting to not work as much well
and so there's some thought that uh
we're heading toward the summer of the
trans activism and and we'll make it
that the idea would be
to Gin up a bunch of trans protests so
that it can paint the especially the
conservative religious part of the democ
of the Republicans as a bunch of bigots
and there really any kind of public
demonstration is not so much about
George Floyd as not so much about
protecting black citizens it's really
just political
you know it's a it's a vehicle with
which people can wrap their politics
around it so it's never about the thing
uh no I said the same thing about me
getting canceled and I'll say it again
nobody cared what I said
nobody cared it's just that there are
some stories in the news that you can
wrap your existing political beliefs
around like a truck so it's like oh
there's a truck that's driving through
my neighborhood oh let me throw my
Politics on there
so everybody who saw my story of getting
canceled
if they thought that was about me
or it was about anything I said or my
opinion or about how my opinion might
change anybody else's mind it was never
about that
and none of these stories are that
that's the lowest level of understanding
of the news
if that's how you saw the news
that that story was actually about me
then you missed the whole story
there were no Republicans who canceled
me
none it was just Democrats so the
Democrats found a truck oh here's one of
those trucks going by I'll throw my
politics in it and I'll get a little
ride a little free ride
so that's all that's happening so the
the trans activism I think is starting
to fit into that model
that the the Democrats don't really care
about any specific trans issue they just
know they can throw their politics into
it and it hurts Republicans so
that works
all right
um and if you stay till the end I
promise you I'll do something that will
make my risk of getting
extra super canceled much higher
so if you're thinking of bailing early
before I risk my entire career of or
what's left of it the the shards of
what's left of my career
you're going to want to see that
all right
um
so Hillary says if Trump gets reelected
it's the end of democracy
is she calling for his assassination
I say yes
I say yes
I say if you are as prominent as Hillary
Clinton now this would be different if
you were just a citizen if you're a
citizen and you say something crazy
people just say ah your opinion but when
Hillary Clinton
says that electing Trump would be the
end of democracy and then of course
they'll use the the January 6
Insurrection hoax to be their evidence
of that
this is definitely
um
a call to assassinate
or at the very least to do whatever it
takes to keep him out of office
I don't even know how that's legal
you know I guess it is because it's free
speech blah blah but it feels like that
should be the most illegal thing that
could happen in the country it should be
more illegal than murder
because when you murder you kill one
person
which is plenty bad and you should be
punished for that
but if you call for the assassination of
a president indirectly
you're you're calling for something that
would destroy the country at least for a
while
I mean the the level of evil
in this just casual statement oh it's
the end of democracy if Trump is elected
now
here's what a reasonable person who
cared about the country would say
he'll uh not be good for the economy
you know debatable
he uh won't be good for international
relations debatable debatable
he uh only cares about himself
debatable
you know I I would argue that his
self-interest in the countries are too
closely aligned that would be hard for
him to get out of that box
um but when you say that it's the end of
democracy
you're really calling for somebody to
kill him
because the end of democracy is a line
where nobody can survive right no
nobody's going to be okay with that
we would die to stop that from happening
ah this is the most irresponsible thing
I've ever seen a leader do no exceptions
that that's a big statement think of all
the bad things leaders have done but
I'll just say the United States because
we don't we don't have a Hitler in the
United States yet
uh
but I think can you think of anything
that would be less
or anything that would be more
irresponsible
than saying that somebody who might be
the next president will destroy
democracy knowing that people will
believe that
that's just about the most unethical
dangerous irresponsible thing that any
American leader has ever said at any
time and in any context
am I wrong about that
I mean I'm making a very extreme
statement but I don't think it's
hyperbole I don't think there's any
public statement by any leader that's
ever been more dangerous
more irresponsible than calling the next
probable I think he's a probable next
president
the end of democracy
that's that's just I don't really know
what to say about that it's so bad like
you you actually lose the ability to
speak about it that's what was happening
just now I was trying to find the right
words
but it's so enormously bad it's just
enormously bad that I I couldn't even
characterize it
it's outside my imagination
that's the problem if something happens
within your imagination
then you probably already have words for
it because it's something that you've
considered but this is outside my
imagination
that that somebody at that level would
call essentially call for an
assassination indirectly
all right and I'm the only one talking
about it
what's up with that nobody else nobody
else thought that was worth mentioning
what was bigger than that
like how did that not become the the
biggest news in the country
but it won't be it won't be
all right looks like the Democrats are
trying to save Tick-Tock uh I saw a saw
a tweet that says that tick tock's on
track uh to have all of its user U.S
user data hosted by Oracle
that's apparently according to the tick
tock CEO now
do you understand the play that China's
doing here
there are two risks with Tick Tock one
is they get all your confidential
information
but the other is they can make anything
go viral they have a heat button that
literally makes something go viral so
they can determine what things you see
or don't see and therefore they can
manipulate and hypnotize the American
public
for example
China has the ability to push one button
and turn more American use trans
true or false
there's literally a button it's called
The Heat button that can make anything
trend
if if China decides to push the heat
button on Pro children transitioning
content
it will make more children in the United
States become trans
do you doubt that
now I'm not saying all of them you know
it doesn't instantly turn everybody
trans but we do know that persuasion
works we do know Peer Pressure Works we
knew we do know that social media
influences people none of this is
controversial
China can actually to turn your children
trans
I would argue that it's already
happening
and that if you could here's the study
I'd like to see
show me a study of trans kids and then
social media usage
if you can show me that there are just
as many trans kids who don't watch tick
tock as there are who do watch Tick Tock
I will change my opinion
but I'm a hundred percent positive it
could be wrong I suppose but you know
I'll give it one percent chance I'm
wrong if you looked at the tick tock
viewers
you would find that they're more likely
to become trans during the time they're
watching tick tock
would anybody take the other side of
that bat
and do you think that that's completely
naturally occurring
do you think that China is not aware of
that impact
of course they're aware
do you think they could stop it if they
wanted to
of course they could of course they
could now here's the problem
we don't know if China has pushed a
button to put heat on something or if
they simply created a situation where
heat would automatically arise in
unproductive places and then they just
let it happen
because that would be just as
destructive and it would also explain
why our version of tick tock is
literally illegal in China
because they know that even if they
don't push any buttons its nature is to
surface bad ideas and make them
prominent could be its nature that's all
they would need and that would make
sense why they just don't even allow it
in China because if if it wasn't bad by
its nature
they could always control what trended
in China right
if the only concern that China had was
any specific persuasion they would just
turn that off in China
oh okay you're worried that we'll turn
Chinese kids trans all right we'll just
turn that off in China
it would be that easy they can control
what content you see
so
anyway so the Democrats appear to be
buying this diversionary technique where
instead of looking at the big risk which
is persuasion they're trying to divert
us to the small risk which is data
security and if they can get Oracle
to allegedly hold the American data they
can make you forget the biggest risk
because they can say the the tick tock
thing we took care of it oh yeah there
was a tick tock risk but we took care of
it no you didn't no you diverted us from
the real risk to the fake risk the small
risk the data the Democrats are doing
that presumably because they like
Tick-Tock to win elections
and they're willing to turn to your kid
Trans in the process because that
doesn't matter so much
um
again this is one of the most evil and
uh unethical things you'll ever see in
your life the Democrats
hiding the fact that the big risk is
persuasion
and by the way the Republicans are just
a little bit better
you know I've I've prodded some of the
Republican people in Congress to mention
persuasion when they mentioned it and
the few of them have
so I know that the Republicans are at
least you know mentally they're on board
with the fact that there are two risks
but you can't find a Democrat to say it
find me any example of a democrat in
Congress who mentioned the risk of
persuasion
as opposed to the risk of data security
you'll find Republicans who have said
both
I don't believe you'll find even one
Democrat who has done anything but say
it's a data security problem and hey
we'll take care of that no problem
yeah
all right so I think Trump should just
ban Tick Tock if he becomes president
or uh DeSantis or as we like to call
them to Sanctus
all right even Chuck Todd this made news
is funny Chuck Dodd did something that
wasn't stupid and it made national news
how would you like to be so incompetent
that when you said something that made
sense and made national news
that actually happened
here's what he said
the NBC host said that basically that
the FBI is looking bad because of the
Durham report and that trust the FBI is
eroding left and right and he's saying
that even the left doesn't trust the FBI
and the Durham reports blah blah it even
suggests that maybe you need something
like the church committee to revamp the
FBI and make it credible again
now again the story is not about the FBI
because we've already talked about the
FBI to death the story is that Chuck
Todd made national news by saying
something reasonable
I mean that's the story
he just said something reasonable based
on the news and things we all agreed to
be true
and that that was national news
that is so embarrassing
that being reasonable get makes you a
headlife
all right speaking of unreasonable
um so you know that the left of course
has tried to demonize Twitter and turn
Twitter into a right-wing uh garbage
dump so that nobody believes anything on
Twitter
and they'll all go to tick tock for
their political opinions I guess
so here's what uh the the Trump attack
dog Stefan Collison says in an opinion
piece and CNN and by the way I do read
the CNN opinion pieces for the humor
meaning that I laugh because it's so
it's so propaganda
I mean it's not even pretending to be
anything like fair and you know that
always makes me laugh so Collinson says
that DeSantis is trying to out Trump a
trump
what do you think of that approach
I think you're going to see more of it
they're going to say all right Trump
trump is the worst thing that we've ever
seen in the history of the Republic
and here's the surprise the guy in
second place even worse
even worse he's out dropping Trump
that it
yeah I don't know it might work with
their base because I think they're
worried that if DeSantis does get some
traction
they're going to end up with a
reasonable looking Republican and they
don't know what to do with that so
they're going to have to turn to santis
into a worse version of trump than Trump
because they've learned that the only
thing they win on is what
what's the only way that the Democrats
went
fear
right they don't win on policies because
they the majority of the public is not
on board with their policies
policy wise I think something like a
you know a middle of the road Republican
would have the most beneficial policies
according to the majority of Americans
so
they've got a they've got this weird
little balance don't they they're trying
to make Trump look like the craziest
person in the world
but then DeSantis comes along and if
they take Trump out by saying he's crazy
and a threat to the Republic you get one
of the strongest uh
Republican operators of all time
because although I don't think
descendants could beat Trump unless
there's some new news that comes out
that we don't know about but head to
head I don't think he could be Trump
however
that said he's unambiguously one of the
sharpest best most effective Republican
leaders
in a long time
would you agree
so what are the Democrats going to do
they want them some DeSantis to run
against because that's not going to work
do they want Trump to run against I
don't think that's going to work either
I mean they've got a real Balancing Act
and I don't even know if the Democrats
have decided how to handle it yet it's
like they have two ways to be wrong and
no way to be right
do you see that they can be wrong in two
different ways but they don't have a way
to be right
because either one of those candidates
should be able to take whoever they run
against in my opinion I think both of
them can take anybody
now Vivek also makes things interesting
I love the fact that the Republican
party has the most diversity
for the for who's running for president
um who's going to challenge so far
Biden's Challengers are uh generic white
guy
and another generic white guy
who who is uh running against Biden so
RFK Jr generic white guy
oh Marianne Williams a generic white
woman
and then ASA ASA Hutchinson no he's
running as a Republican
wasn't there somebody else
newsom's not really running
Bernie's not running but
so now you've got you know Nikki Haley
and you got Vivek you've got Tim Tim
Scott
so even though Trump you know would be
the standard Bearer probably if he wins
the primary
that's a lot of diversity
that's a lot of diversity
yeah RFK Jr is generic by guy I mean
he's more interesting than the average
generic white guy but so is Trump
um
The Debs are going to say Tim Scott is a
racist yeah good luck with that that's
probably why they have to turn to the uh
the trans issues the racism thing was
sort of wearing out
all right let's see what else Stephen
Collins has said uh it says of Twitter
uh that's because Twitter which once
offered a platform for Democratic
movements in the Arab Spring has been
transformed by its new owner into a way
for it a febrile circus of Untamed Free
Speech conspiracy theories and
unverifiable information
does that sound like words out of you
yeah word salad I had to look up febrile
have you ever heard that word
f-e-b-r-i-l-e yeah it means like a
feverish
approach to something like a feverish
excitement
so it's a feverish what is it
uh
it's a
a fever circus of Untamed Free Speech
now let's break down these complaints
Untamed free speech
Untamed free speech
that's a bad thing
I thought Untamed free speech is what we
like
it's Untamed because the Democrats don't
control it anymore
the Democrats are actually against
Untamed free speech
here it is it's right here it said
writing opposed to untamed free speech
wouldn't most of you run toward Untamed
free speech I wouldn't run away from it
I'd run toward it
that's why I'm on Twitter I like the
Untamed free speech
so what else is bad about it besides the
Untamed free speech conspiracy theories
and unfair unverifiable information well
thank goodness
Stefan Collinson has alerted us that
only since must turn took over Twitter
that's when that's when things got bad
with conspiracy theories and
unverifiable information
you all notice that right it used to be
there were no conspiracy theories
and there was no unverified information
but as soon as as soon as musk took over
I don't know what happened suddenly
suddenly there are all these conspiracy
theories that were never there before
and unverified information my god I
didn't even think it existed until musk
took over now suddenly some information
is unverified are you kidding me how
could we live in this world with
unverified information and conspiracy
theories and untame Free Speech
wait a minute I just turned into that
meme
oh my God I just turned into the meme
it's like that right
I'm not wrong
look at that face
that's my impression of the internet
meme face
anyway it's hilarious
uh so you better stay away from that
febrile circus called Twitter
you don't want to be part of a febrile
circus
you know that's one of the things that
my mother taught me when I was young
I I was probably only I don't know maybe
eight nine years old and she called me
in one day and she said
you should always uh look both ways
before crossing the street
I understood that
she said uh be home by five o'clock for
dinner because you don't have a
smartphone they haven't been invented
yet and I thought wow how does she even
know that but yes so I'd be home at five
but then she would always throw in no
matter what other advice she would say
but most importantly
stay away from any febrile circuses
and I would say you mean
the feverish kind of circuses because I
had really good vocabulary then
and my mother would say exactly
stay away from the febrile circuses
and I've done that for most of my life
and I think that's paid off
so that's my advice to you too no
febrile circuses
well here's a little surprise the
American
economy it keeps surprising on the
upside
like I think we try to do everything we
can to kill the American economy you
know through our politics and you know
bad opinions and stuff and it just keeps
it just keeps going so apparently the
services sector is better than it's ever
been
so may was like the best it's ever been
now manufacturing is you know not great
but the services sector you know stuff
like vacations and things uh there's a
lot of pent-up demand it looks like
so that's good now inflation did come
down
uh
uh and uh Donald luskin had a uh a piece
on the Wall Street Journal
you should follow Donald luskin on uh
Twitter as well good follow for
economics
um
and he talks about how the the FED is
always fighting the last war
so
you know I won't give you the economic
argument here because you're not all
going to love it but the uh
the point is that people who work for
the Fed
and people who were also experts in
economics don't have the same opinion of
what works and what they should be doing
and when
you think that economics would have
figured that out
that if you do this you'll get more
inflation
and if you do this you'll get less
inflation don't you think that that
the most basic basic economic thing you
don't think the experts should be
agreeing on that stuff
but they don't
they don't like like even the FED seems
to be confused about what caused
inflation according to other economists
right not according to me but according
to other economists so what is up with
that
like we
you think that you can
you can distrust experts and you think
you've reached the level of skepticism
that's appropriate it's like oh yeah I
don't trust all the experts no I'm I
live in the real world I know experts
could be lying for a variety of reasons
or just wrong
but did you think of it did you think it
would go all the way
to all the experts in economics in the
world can't agree on the most basic
thing
will this cause more or less inflation
and
so Donald luskin raises the alarm that
because the FED is fighting the last war
in other words I think his view if I'm
characterizing right is that inflation
is going to come down on its own
so if the FED is goosing the reduction
of inflation you can get to disinflation
and you're in real trouble with
disinflation it doesn't sound like
trouble does it your prices are coming
down
sounds good right
what do you do when your prices are
dropping
how do you act when prices are dropping
how do you act if you think a car will
be less expensive in six months than it
is now
yeah you stop buying you just completely
stop buying things because it'll be
cheaper in six months
if you stop buying things the economy
dies
so this was a real useful context thing
is that the FED might be doing the exact
opposite of what would be good for the
economy and the argument is that the FED
didn't cause inflation and the things
they're doing is not going to reduce it
much
it's it's external factors that cause
inflation external factors that will
reduce inflation especially that you
know the bonus payments for the during
the pandemic once those stopped it was a
big source of inflation that went away
and
it could be
that the FED is pushing Us in the
direction we're already going to go
and that that will go there too far too
fast and prices will decrease and then
the whole thing falls apart
so good to know
but it's interesting that experts are
completely on opposite ends of what
makes sense for for economics
all right
um
you know those uh those neo-nazis in
Charlottesville who are saying they will
not replace us
now I think they were talking about
um not just it wasn't just anti-semitic
I think it was about immigration as well
right
and they were concerned that uh brown
people from other countries would be
replacing white people in the United
States and apparently it's happened so
we've had some prominent examples where
White supremacists
which used to be a job that only white
people held
has now largely gone to brown people
so I mean you got the the head of the uh
the proud boys yeah how did the proud
Boys
Part Cuban I guess
um and then there was the uh the Indian
American who had the Nazi flag and tried
to attack the White House recently
you know that was a job that was totally
white people they used to do that but
now now Indian Americans getting in on
the white supremacist stuff uh the
replacement is happening and I think we
had some we had some other examples
recently didn't we of uh Brown uh White
supremacists
yeah
so I didn't believe him when they said
that immigrants were going to be
replacing white people but they are
taking the white supremacist jobs I
don't know about the other jobs but the
white supremacists are losing a lot of
jobs and uh I think somebody should look
into that
well
it turns out that being a Critic of
Putin is not good for your health
Russia's Deputy minister of Science in
higher education
who apparently was a Critic of Putin
died mysteriously on the flight nobody
knows why he just got on the flight and
he fell ill and he died I wonder if he
ate anything on the flight
a big old big old coincidence all these
Kremlin critics they just keep dying
you know it's kind of amazing
that Putin just murders his critics
and apparently he's done enough of it so
we're just used to it
do you remember when it was a big story
that Putin murdered a Critic
and now it's just it's just one of the
stories
Putin actually made us get used to the
fact that he murders his critics outside
the country
we just got used to it
have I told you that before that you can
get used to anything
this is a perfect example
it was the biggest outrage and that was
just a little news story Putin's killed
killing another person
all right
for those of you who are nice enough to
wait to the end
uh I give you the most provocative
dangerous thought
you've ever seen
I call it my fear map
and it's on the back of this whiteboard
and
I'm gonna cause some trouble here
now people sometimes ask me Scott
why are you saying this
so they don't question what I say but
often they'll say what's your purpose
what are you trying to accomplish here
so I'll tell you what I'm gonna I'm
trying to accomplish and then I'll
explain
what I'm trying to accomplish is since I
find myself in a unique situation
that I'm already canceled
I can't get too much extra canceled it
wouldn't make that much difference so I
have free speech
in a way that you don't
so I can simply say things that I think
would be useful and I am trying to I am
trying to focus on things that are
useful right I'm not just trying to mix
stuff up not trying to get some extra
clicks everybody likes extra clicks but
that's not why I'm doing it I'm doing it
because they're just some things that I
uniquely can say out loud
that are useful I will only do useful
things that you need to hear
specifically what I'm going to talk
about would be useful for black
Americans
it won't feel like it
might feel the opposite
but here's my my general statement
you need to have good information to
make good decisions you all agree with
that right the better your information
about your situation the better
decisions you can make I believe that
black Americans are crippled by the fact
that white people lie to them about
everything
um white people can you give me some
confirmation white people lie to Black
Americans about everything because we've
been trained to lie we've been trained
to hide our true opinions because we
would be demonized if we were even just
objectively talking about data right
even if even if white people are just
just trying to help
trying to help will get you canceled for
sure all right so here I am I'm going to
try to help and there's something I
couldn't have done
except I'm already canceled
so you're going to see one of the rare
things that you've ever seen in public
a canceled person telling you the truth
now I'm going to Prime you a little bit
more
when this type of topic necessarily is
easier to talk about when you talk about
groups of people acting on average
if I say white people
like cheese
you're smart enough to know that I don't
mean every white person likes cheese
right it's just sort of a general
statement if I say black people like
hip-hop
you're smart enough to know not everyone
not every black person likes hip-hop
that'd be crazy
so everything I say about any group is
just a generalization it does not
include you
or any specific person
the next thing I'm going to say which is
very important under no circumstances
does it ever make sense to discriminate
against an individual
in Romance
in hiring in your social life your
family life any kind of you know
employment anything like that giving
somebody a loan
it makes no sense to discriminate
individually because it doesn't help the
person you're discriminating against it
doesn't help the system you know the
United States it doesn't help you as a
discriminator you're just cutting
yourself off from you know the the
beauty and talent of most of the world
so if you have a situation where nobody
wins
how can you possibly be in favor of any
part of that so discrimination against
individuals
you can't favor it on any level
because there are no winners it's just a
lose all the way across and it's the
opposite of what made America great
which is we tried really hard not to be
those people we didn't succeed but we
tried really hard to be those people
so with that in mind I give you the fear
map
now I'm roughly dividing people in the
United States by income and education
would you agree that education is highly
correlated with income again we're not
talking about every person of course
there are people who didn't go to
college and made a lot of money of
course but in general
the higher your education the greater
your income right and now I'm going to
start with a white person in America's
experience
now when I talk about fear I'm talking
about a visceral irrational reaction
right I'm not talking about logic
this is just fear irrational fear
as a white American if I go into a low
income area that's all white Americans
am I afraid
if I go to a low income area that's just
all white people am I afraid for my life
nope not even a little I grew up in a
low income mostly white area
I never thought about it and I never
even thought about violence I mean there
was plenty of violence because it's
everywhere but I didn't have any special
fear about white people being a white
person
suppose I go into a middle income
environment I get a blue collar job I
just go to work and let's say let's say
that my co-workers are all white
am I afraid of anything special
well just the normal dangers of life
but I'm not extra afraid because my
co-workers are white why would I be
it wouldn't even come up
um how about high income and high
education if I spend some time around
some Highly Educated white people
would I be in trouble
well yes a little bit
the the higher educated white people are
more likely to accuse you of being a
racist am I right
High income white people will accuse
other white people of being racist
that's where it comes from universities
and people write books and stuff so if
as a white person in America I would
have I would feel again it's just a
feeling I would feel no risk around poor
white people
there would be a risk because income and
and crime come together so there would
be a little extra risk but I wouldn't
feel it I've never felt it in fact I can
think of zero places in the United
States
that are mostly White
that I would have any danger feeling
going to although there would be
elevated risk with lower income
in the middle income I don't worry about
white people at all at the high income I
do worry about them that at high income
white people I do see as potentially my
enemy
does that make sense
not necessarily my enemy but potentially
yeah now let's say
you're a black American and we'll just
reverse it
you're a black American and you're in a
low income area
is your danger higher
probably
if you're a black American and you're in
a middle kid income environment is your
danger higher probably not
I mean
probably not right how about if you're
black and you're in a high income high
education area
probably not much danger at all
you'd probably be pretty happy
suppose you're a white person
and you're contemplating going into an
all-black area that's also low income
would that be risky
to be a white person going into a low
income mostly black area
well you can talk about the data or the
statistics but I can tell you with
certainty that would scare the out
of all white people
all of them
now of course when I say all I don't
really mean all right because every
every time I talk about a group it's
never all it's just sort of an average
yeah white people are scared to death of
going into low-income black areas
what about white people going into an
environment that had a big mix of lots
of black people in the workplace along
with everybody else so it's not mostly
black but you know it's a good mix of
diversity would a white person have any
fear
being in an environment that was a mixed
group versus let's say all white
yes
because the fear is that you will be
accused of racism
right
if you work in a mixed group the odds of
you being a white person being accused
of being a racism or close to 100
percent
do you want that
that's that's an extra risk that you
don't have to put up with
How about if you're a white person and
you're in an environment where there's a
lot of diversity
at the higher income level
well they're going to tell you that
you're the problem that you're you're
supporting white supremacy and you owe
me some money
right so
if you're a white person in a diverse
environment you've got the extra risk
that they're going to ask for
reparations no white person has ever
asked me for reparations
again this has nothing to do with
whether the reparations are a good or
bad idea
I'm just saying from a risk
management perspective being in
California is riskier than being in
Idaho
am I wrong in California there's a risk
I will pay reparations for having
nothing to do with slavery that's a risk
if I go to Idaho probably no risk
probably no risk of any reparations
so
I will say again
if you're dealing with an individual
of any color ethnicity religion and
gender you have to treat them as an
individual you just have to it's good
for you it's good for them and it's the
only thing that makes our system work
however if you're judging your personal
risk
you can use averages
it's not against the Constitution
it's not against the law
it's not unethical
it's not immoral
it's just risk management
it's just risk management and everybody
gets to do that
there's nothing that took away your
ability to manage your own personal risk
so
I would say if you're a white person
there are three areas you should have
extra
concern about because your risk would be
higher anywhere there's a high ratio of
black people in a low income area
anytime you're working with a number of
black people who have been trained by
Society to see you as the enemy and then
accuse you of discrimination whether you
do it or not and then the high income
group you get the professors who will
say not only are you discriminating at
the moment
but just by existing your mere existence
it makes you an
so
should you use your risk management
common sense to stay away from dangerous
situations or
should you allow yourself to be in what
are obviously more dangerous situations
because that would be the moral thing to
do
is it more moral
to put yourself in obviously more
dangerous situations not physically but
also reputationally and money-wise Etc
now it is moral and ethical to manage
your risk any way you want
any way you want
am I canceled
did I say anything you don't agree with
was there one thing here anything that
you didn't agree with
no you agreed with all of it right
you know this is what got me canceled
right
so earlier in the live stream I said I
didn't get canceled for what I said
I got canceled because I was a truck
going through the neighborhood that
wanted to put their message on the truck
so I just happened to be the truck and
they just loaded me up with their
message and I carried it with them yeah
I couldn't get it off my my truck bed it
was too late
that's all my fault by the way I take I
take full responsibility just to be
clear I always take full responsibility
for my own actions
and the outcomes so of course I take
full responsibility for getting canceled
but you should understand the mechanism
which is slightly different from who
takes responsibility
now
when I explain it this way
you all said oh
right
but when I explained it in the let's say
the angrier more provocative way where I
said you just stay the F away from
blah blah blah it was just the story
it was just this
and when I when I explained it without
the Hyperbole and without the swearing
you just looked at and said oh yeah that
makes sense
yeah that is higher risk now what's
different is
um it's hard it's hard to manage you
know in the short term the extra risk
that comes with low income right because
low income and crime are pretty
entangled
but I would say that if the middle
income and high income
there's a media poisoning
and the media has poisoned black
Americans and black Americans have not
yet figured out
that white Americans really need to kind
of stay away from them for their own
safety
again not individuals
if there's an individual
you should treat them individually but
if you're deciding should I go to an
environment where my co-workers would be
mixed or less mixed
you are managing your risk in a
realistic way that's that the media has
created you didn't create that you did
not create any of that risk
and you do get to avoid it
if that's your preference
now if somebody a number of people said
that you should increase your personal
risk
to make sure that there's plenty of
interaction among groups
because in the long run the the mixture
of the people will give you a better
outcome you know you'll get used to
people and you know discrimination will
go away on its own
to which I say I don't think you've
lived in the real world at all and it's
not my job to make the world better in
50 years because I uh did what you
described my job is to not get my ass
kicked
that's my job I just don't want my ass
to get kicked I don't want to I don't
want my reputation or my money to be
taken
that's all so I'm just going to look out
for that stuff
so
I'm loving I'm loving the nature of the
comments
because usually when I'm doing my silly
stuff you know there'll be silly
comments and if I do things you disagree
with you know there's a big pushback
that's coming in immediately
but this kind of scrambled your brain a
little bit didn't it maybe in a way you
liked
but you well I can tell when you get a
little quiet that there's there's some
processing going
so I think there's a lot of processing
happening on this right now
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
the conclusion of my live stream for
today
uh YouTube thanks for coming back after
I so rudely disconnected to you
yesterday because my battery died
but I think it was worth it
and uh
yeah most of you I think were on this
page so here's a writer's trick for you
here's how I describe a good writer
a good writer at least in the
non-fiction World a good writer is
somebody who says what you already think
but they say it better than you were
thinking it have you ever heard me say
that before
so that's what this was
this was me telling you what you already
thought most of you I think
but I I said it better than you were
thinking so now you can think it better
because you've you've just seen another
way to model it
so that's it for today YouTube I'll see
you in the morning tomorrow come on back
bye for now
