um
hey everybody
it's time for a coffee with scott adams
the best part of the day
i don't know if you've noticed this but
if you start your day off right
everything seems a little bit better
well i'm going to be relentlessly
positive today
it's all optimism and good news and
golden age and and all that stuff but
i'm going to put the hypnosis filter on
the news so you can see
the way it just sees it
but first
but first how about the simultaneous sip
and all you need is a copper micro glass
a tanker tells you to sign a canteen
jugger flask of vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
makes everything better yeah it's called
the simultaneous zip and it happens now
go
and if this wasn't enough and i think it
was
but if it wasn't
there will be a whiteboard later yeah
yeah talk about having it all
they say you can't have it all
but we're going to challenge that today
you're gonna have it all
all right
some reason all of my show notes just
disappeared
[Laughter]
that's the first
had them actually open and was looking
at them well
let's look at
uh
trash
well it's a tragedy folks my show notes
have just disappeared
but as luck would have them i posted
them on the locals platform this is
going to sound like a clever commercial
but i swear i didn't plan this
if you're if you're a member of the
locals community
i've started posting my show notes
before the show
and
uh
there they are okay
so i'll just read them all for locals
so i told you i was going to give you
the hypnosis filter on the news so it's
basically the persuasion filter
had a look at the irrational parts of
the news
we'll get to all that but
today in california at least where i
live is the first day of school
first day of school with masks
and that means that today is the first
day of mass government-sponsored child
abuse
well at least according to a lot of us
we'll talk about the
statistics of it but i'm wondering if
children wearing masks in school
is one tick tock meme away from going
away
and let me give you
an analogy
when i was in high school
a million years ago we had something
called a senior ditch day
and it was a day that the seniors would
all collectively ditch classes and go to
the lake and
drink beer illegally
and basically just play hooky from
school
now
if
three or four of the seniors had decided
to do that they'd probably get in
trouble
they'd they'd be absent somebody would
punish them maybe their parents would be
mad
but
because they all do it
it's just a tradition
so the school just says ah crap what are
you gonna do
and they just deal with it so the
teachers just have a day off and the the
kids all go to the lake
uh i recall vividly being thrown in that
lake
on a very cold day
very cool day
uh so it wasn't a good day for me if you
throw it in a frozen lake
but
it was an accident actually but i did
end up in the frozen lake
and
um it seems to be that all it would take
is one tick-tock meme
to tell everybody to take off their
masks i'm talking about students now to
take off their masks at the same time
that is probably all you need now i'm
not predicting that'll happen
but i like to point out
how thin the difference is
between everybody wearing masks in
school
and nobody wearing masks in school
it's probably
right
just a little bit it would take to
completely change the situation all it
would take
is one meme that says do it at the same
time and if the kids bought into it
that's all it would take
so if senior ditch day works uh how
could it be scaled up
here's some uh
indication of good news to come i've
told you many times that
we'll never be able to text and
um spend our way to everybody having
everything they need we're going to have
to lower the the cost
of a high quality life
you know the your housing your food etc
and there's something happening here
that's
really exciting in that world do you
know what adus are it's probably a term
that is uh local
but it refers to uh i forget what adu
stands for something like uh
it's like an extra unit of living space
basically a building that you can put
into your backyard that would be a
standalone home for
you know an in-law or somebody who just
needed a little care
and there's one called boxable
company is called boxable and it's a
folding home
they actually ship it and fold it up and
then on site the walls just fold out and
the furniture is already there or at
least the the built-in stuff is already
there
they claim they can give you 375 square
square feet of buildings of space
which would be you know pretty tiny
apartment but it would have a kitchen
bathroom bedroom little living area
now if it starts at 50k just for the the
unfolding box itself
and you figure that's the starting price
so the one you want it's going to be
more than that
then you add your land your taxes your
permits your plumbing your sewer and all
that stuff
um so i don't know could you get could
you get the cost of a decent home
down to a hundred thousand
and then everything changes
i think you could i think we're heading
in that way but it looks like the the
adu industry is what's going to lead the
way because they're going to do all the
innovations for how to make the the
cheapest home
and i think that's just a crossover
regular homes
all right here's a warning to you
beware of your own certainty
do you ever wonder
let's say you you wanted to know are you
hallucinating your opinion
uh or do you have a rational opinion
because wouldn't you like to know that
you probably know
that the only person who can't tell
they're crazy is the crazy person right
the person who doesn't know they're
hallucinating
is the one who's doing it but everybody
else can see it you know if you run into
somebody who's hallucinating you can
tell it's easy
but they can't tell so wouldn't you like
a little rule
that you could use just an objective
little rule
to know if you're hallucinating
all right
well here's one
now this is not one of those 100 rules
it's just a really good indication
that you're hallucinating and it goes
like this
you have certainty
about the uncertain
that's it
do you have certainty about something
that really can't be known
for example
are you certain just totally dead
certain that getting the vaccination is
better than not
or
the other way are you dead certain that
getting that the reverse is true
if you're dead certain about either of
those things or anything else
you're probably hallucinating
in other words you're you you could be
reasonably sure
that your opinion is not moored to any
facts or rational anything it could be
right
i'm not saying you're wrong
i'm saying that you might have arrived
at your decision through an irrational
process
and certainty
is really a tell for that
if you see somebody saying well you know
i'm like 80 sure
that vaccinations are a good idea
is that person hallucinating
no no they could be right and they could
be wrong
the 80 could be way off
or the could or it could be right and
they made the wrong choice
but they're at least not hallucinating
if you're talking in terms of
probability you're probably
looking at data and doing the best you
can with rational thought
we're not good at it at least you try
them
if you have certainty
that's a tell it's a gigantic tell
all right
uh that's your first tip how to know
you're hallucinating
uh is it my imagination or has trump
been a little bit too quiet recently
right
because he's fairly consistent about
staying in the news
but
correct me if i'm wrong didn't hasn't
trump go on quiet
and if he has
is something coming
is there something coming
maybe he's uh you know working on legal
issues because of his taxes or whatever
i don't know so he might be
you know working on something
but still
wouldn't he
make sure that he issued some
provocative statements to get in the
news again
well no i don't think it's a storm
coming somebody just said
but uh
there's something coming right
you feel it don't you
because because he's too quiet so
that's one of the things that
you know i like to look at is the dog
that's not barking and at the moment
trump is not barking and you gotta ask
why
either something big is coming
or it's a mystery
all right
here's some china persuasion
um
why is it that we still do business we
the the business community in the united
states and other countries why do we
still do business with china
when we know that there are
clear business risks
and also
horrible things going on let's say the
the uyghurs being put into camps
let's say the allegations that the uh
falloon gong uh people are being used
for
um
unwilling
donations of body parts
you know transplants and stuff i mean
they're just
horrible allegations against china
and we still do business there
we still do business why is that all
right here's the
the hypnotist filter on it the reason is
it doesn't affect us
have you once had your day
affected
by the uyghurs being in camps
well if you have a any kind of a empathy
for human beings you certainly had some
empathy for it you felt bad you thought
you should do something about it you
know maybe you doubled down on your
intentions to not buy from china or
something but mostly
mostly it didn't affect you
right maybe a little bit in your head
but it didn't affect your day
right
so
it doesn't matter how good an argument
is
how moral it is
how ethical it is what's right and
what's wrong
we kind of care what affects us today
right that just matters more
because we're not really all about the
the morality and the principle when it
comes down to it it's not very
predictive
but i'll tell you what is predictive
if if china gets
let's say we find out that the wuhan lab
was absolutely the source of a
in any way engineered virus
and that china is let's say held
accountable
for letting it happen and for maybe
covering it up so those things both seem
reasonably likely to happen
what happens then
to china as a place to do business
because
let's say you're nike
you're nike and you say gosh i really
want to keep making my sneakers there
because i'm getting good quality i'm
getting the good price i don't want to
have to make a change it would be really
expensive we've got business
relationships i really really really
really really want to just keep making
my sneakers in china
well they can get away with that as long
as their customers say some form of
you know i hate what china's doing but
it doesn't seem to affect me
but what happens when it does what
happens when the thing you think about
china is the wuhan lab causing the
pandemic
because the pandemic
affects you
right if you're wearing a mask
anywhere
it's because of china
or it'll feel like that if the if the
attribution goes to the
wuhan lab
and i feel like this will be a turning
point for china
that it seems likely that we're going to
attribute the problem to the lab
and it seems likely
that the story the narrative will
include china covering it up the two
worst things that you could compare
at that point
it's personal
do you see the difference
and so this is the the the hypnotist
filter on the news
as long as what china is doing this bad
is just a concept yeah they stole some
intellectual property
from somebody i don't know
the company i don't care about
i don't know
they locked up some people for their
religious views the uyghurs
well
but i still
went to work and
my day was exactly the same
yeah even fentanyl you know i'm i'm
activated because fentanyl touched my
family
but what if it hadn't
what if i never knew anybody who had a
fentanyl overdose i wouldn't feel any
personal connection to china whatsoever
but it's personal for me
and i think that it's going to get
personal for a lot of americans when
china becomes the the cause of the
pandemic
more so
than you already think
you know i think there's another level
for that so i think china has got
china has enormous problems and i don't
even know if they know how big they are
because if you're in china can you
really read the mood of the united
states
because their fate
sort of depends on our mood doesn't it i
mean literally
literally our mood in the united states
will determine the future of china and
our mood
is on it's on the border right now
between
it's not my problem yeah i don't like
china not my problem and you did this to
me china that's a big difference
china's in trouble
let me give you a
little inspirational lesson here i'm
going to plop this right in the middle
of my news talk
three experiences on learning and
motivation all right i'm gonna give you
three just quick little anecdotes
and then tie them together
years ago when i was first trying to get
syndicated as a cartoonist which is the
big break for a cartoonist i sent my
samples to a number of
cartoon syndication companies they're
the ones who make a deal with a
cartoonist which is your big break
and then they sell it to newspapers and
license it and stuff if you're lucky
so i submitted my stuff to the several
syndicates that existed at the time
most of them just rejected me
you know with just a form letter
but one of them rejected me by telling
me that
my writing might have some merit
but i should find somebody else to do
the drawing for me
just what you want to hear when you're
trying to become a professional
cartoonist
is one of the most knowledgeable people
in the industry an editor at a top
syndication company
telling you that maybe you should look
into having somebody else do the hard
part
the drawing
so that wasn't so good for
my
my cartooning ego
but i took all of my materials and i put
them in a closet and i said to myself
well i tried
and i felt good that i tried
but of course it was a abject failure a
few months later i get a call from sarah
gillespie an editor at united media the
biggest
i think they were the biggest cartoon
syndication and company and i thought
i'd gotten all of my rejections but
somehow i'd missed that i hadn't heard
from them
and she offered me a contract
right over the phone to become a
syndicated cartoonist which turned out
to be my big break that made dilbert um
successful
and toward the end of the conversation
you know i'm still reeling from the fact
that i got this offer at all
i said to her but i realized that my
drawing style
is not up to any professional level
and i said i'd be willing you know if
you think this would make the product
better i'd be willing to work with an
artist to do the actual drawing for me
and maybe i could just do the writing
and sarah gillespie said to me
what's wrong with your art it's fine
just the way it is
so she wizard of oz me
she freaking wizard devozed me do you
know what happened to my drawing quality
within 24 hours of being told that i was
a professional cartoonist and that my
current drawing style
was already
professional class
which which i didn't believe to be even
close to true
the moment a professional at the top of
the industry
told me that my drawing was good enough
the drawing style improved about 30
in a day
and then kept improving so at this point
you know i'm certainly not an artist
with a capital a
but certainly my comic is well drawn and
executed you know just through practice
so that's that's your first lesson that
somebody literally changed my
performance in one day by about 30
percent i would figure simply be telling
me that i was worthy that's it now hold
that story for a moment here comes
another one
uh i took the dale carnegie course
you've heard this story where you learn
to do public speaking and also
interacting with strangers you know
small talk and stuff and you learn a
bunch of things about how to be
comfortable
in these uncomfortable social situations
especially giving a speech
and the technique that dale carnegie
uses i've told this story a bunch of
times
is they only give you compliments
that's it
that's the whole technique they don't
tell you what you did wrong
imagine trying to learn a skill
and nobody ever tells you what you're
doing wrong not once
did they say stop jingling the change in
your pocket
not once did they say make eye contact
not once
did the instructor tell anybody
that anything was imperfect
not once the whole class
how many people in that class went from
basket cases just couldn't talk in front
of people literally couldn't even make a
word
there were people who couldn't form
words
in front of a crowd
like they would just ah
um
ah
just frozen
and with no
specific help
no specific criticism and only
encouragement telling you what you did
right even if it was a small thing
how many of the i don't know there were
probably 25 people in the class that i
took how many of them do you think
became really good speakers
at the end of i don't know 10 weeks or
something 100
i've never seen anything like it
100
every single person there
could stand up on a moment's notice
and give a speech to a large crowd of
people without
dropping a bead of sweat
third story
some of you know i've been trying to
learn drums
i started with an online teacher who was
very good at a lot of getting me the
basics
but ultimately it wasn't quite making
progress and i thought i'll i'll try to
be an auto die deck
self teach myself look at a lot of
youtube videos and see how far i can get
didn't work at all
all right there are a lot of things that
i i can teach myself i'm mostly
self-taught and most of the things i do
but i couldn't get there the the
drumming was beyond my ability to to
self-teach so i did so i now have a new
drum teacher
and he's come over i don't know half a
dozen times or more
and we do half an hour
and my my drumming is
way better
just with a few lessons just way better
and i realized uh i didn't realize this
until yesterday
that i've had all these lessons with
this this instructor
he's never once
told me i was doing anything wrong
not once
he never once told me i did anything
wrong in all those lessons
the only thing he does is he tells me i
did great and i must have been
practicing during the week
which i wasn't
he's actually complimenting me for
things i didn't do
like practicing
you know i mean i practiced a little bit
not enough to make a difference
but how much better is my drumming
with nothing but positive reinforcement
way better
way better it it's like you know
suddenly it just you know the the
the the curve just went straight up and
it has nothing to do with anything
except the fact that he told me i was
good and i didn't believe it
because i'm not but the fact that he
tells me that makes me interested
and then i'm excited and then i can
learn it so suddenly the ability to
learn just sort of turns on
now this particular
drum instructor
uh also is a personal trainer you know
and piano instructor he instructs
christina and piano as well and
his technique is basically to make
people successful here's the fourth
story
i had a neighbor who was a tennis bro
and i would ask him how do you teach
little kids
to play tennis when every time they
swing the racket they're not going to
hit the ball back
so how do you go from
i never hit a ball back
to being a tennis player like how could
you get past the mental part of well it
failed a billion times in a row this is
fun
and he told me that you only teach them
success
so if he has a little kid who basically
can barely hold a tennis racquet he has
them walked right up to the net
and then he tosses the ball to them from
two feet away and has them go
and just swing the racket at in the
general direction he hits some part of
the racket and ends up on his side of
the court
and then he praises him
and that's all he does he'll stand there
for an hour just going
you know a two foot and the kid swings
and it goes and it hits the ground and
the kid's happy
all he teaches is success
and then they get interested and as they
get older their ability to hold a racket
improves and
and they just get into it
entirely
through being interested so here that's
your uh your micro lesson of the day
this is sort of similar to the things i
put on the locals platform i've got a
number of them queued up that i'm going
to be adding there soon
if you like that kind of stuff
rasmussen has a poll
asking people as biden kept his campaign
promises
more less or about the same as most
presidents
uh 30 percent said he's
done better than most presidents
41
said he's done less well in terms of
keeping his promises
25 about the same
25
um
but here's the interesting part
uh
in every poll
we know
every political poll and even a lot of
scientific related polls we expect this
gigantic difference between
conservatives and liberals and sure
enough
63 percent of conservatives think biden
has done
less well
than other presidents at keeping his
promises
but yet a fairly similar amount of
liberals think he
has so the people who like biden the
least the conservatives
uh think he's not keeping his promises
isn't that good
wait a minute if the people who don't
like biden believe he's not keeping his
promises then they should be kind of
happy
but wait 58 of liberals think he is
keeping his promises better than usual
so they're happy too
how how weird is it that both the
conservatives and the liberals got what
they wanted
as far as they can tell
the conservatives think they got what
they wanted because he's not doing his
promises
and the liberals think they did get what
they wanted because he's keeping his
promises
they're both happy
you know something like 60
ish of both groups
kind of getting what they want i mean
indirectly not completely
so
there's some good news see i told you i
was going to put the optimistic filter
on everything
that's what that was
yes we're going to talk about governor
cuomo resigning
why do you think cuomo had to resign
with these allegations but trump did not
and went on to win the presidency in the
comments let's put put the hypnosis
filter on it yourself
tell me what was different
why did trump survive
allegations
and cuomo did not
i see somebody saying the brand close
and maybe that's correct um
in office when it happened uh okay
i don't know if that makes a difference
ah
damn it just lost my locals feed 28
minute cut off
but they're used to it now so um nursing
home deaths uh that's a yeah the nursing
home deaths might have been the real
reason huh and people just used
whatever they could
so it could be it could be that they're
is a fake because right
hello locals you're back
um
so yeah i'll give you the answer you
didn't miss the answer
uh here's the answer
trump inoculated you
he inoculated you
trump
trump gave you the vaccination
oddly enough you were vaccinated against
accusations about trump because what did
trump tell you directly
my my favorite thing that trump has ever
said
at any time president or pre-president
or ex-president my favorite thing he
ever said was
in public
i'm no angel
his actual words right i'm no angel
and was there anybody who when he
entered when he entered the race is
there anybody who thought there wouldn't
be allegations of sexual
something
nobody thought that
everybody who lives in the real world
said well wait for these stories
we're going to see some good stories
here and sure enough
the stories were just as good as we
thought they would be you got your porn
star check
you got your playboy playmate of the
year
check
you got your allegations of
something horrible happening in a
dressing room well i didn't see that one
coming exactly but something like that
was going to come
check
you got it all
now you could argue that uh and i think
i would argue this that the allegations
against trump
felt less credible
right now i'm not going to say that none
of it's true because i wasn't there
and i do agree with the the kind of
general statement that you should take
people seriously when they make
allegations but they didn't feel as true
as the cormorant ones now maybe that's
my bias
i don't know maybe you'd have a
different view maybe
you know maybe democrats and
republicans have different views on that
but it didn't seem as credible
they they felt a little manufactured
even if they were true they didn't feel
as true
so
i would say that the biggest thing that
trump did right is he inoculated you and
you you knew that his brand was
consistent with being
kind of that guy
like it or not
uh
whereas cuomo was sort of the uh the
lefty support all women
he shouldn't have been that guy so so
they had to get rid of their own guy
for being
too much like trump
all right so here
here are the things that won't get you
fired as cnn of course the the big story
that we want to talk about is you know
chris cuomo interviewing his brother and
you know
being basically a cheerleader instead of
asking him hard questions and
you know it's inappropriate and you know
you know chris cuomo was advising his
brother so it's extra creepy
blah blah here's my take on that
i don't care
why do you care about that
why do you care
that chris cuomo is the brother of
andrew cuomo and that chris cuomo
treated him extra extra nice
on tv
why why do you care about that was there
anybody there who thought that
uh
that a brother
was not going to talk to his brother or
give advice
nobody
nobody there's not one person in the
world who thought that was reasonable
that a brother doesn't talk to another
brother under any conditions i don't
care who it is
i don't care if it's part of the legal
system
you know i don't care if they've got
conflict of interest
under no circumstance
do you tell me that there's something
wrong with a brother talking to a
brother i'm sorry
that's an absolute
there's some things that are just
absolutes
that's a absolute sorry i'm
trying to trying to curse less that's
just an absolute so if you're if you're
getting worked up about a brother
talking to a brother
i mean
check your thinking there
it's not a standard you want i mean you
don't want that applied to you so i
can't get mad about that nor can i get
mad
that
you know
it was
you know such nice treatment of his
brother because what do you expect
secondly i found it entertaining
cnn is an entertainment network as much
as a news network maybe more
entertainment you could argue
i personally enjoyed
watching the brothers talk because it
was like an extra layer of something
interesting but as long as you know it's
an opinion program
who cares
if
if
if if it were the news segment i would
say that's a big problem
but if something is clearly an opinion
show and somebody in an opinion show is
talking to their brother
is there anybody who doesn't understand
that that's supposed to be biased
i don't i just don't have any problem
with chris cuomo on any of this
so
i mean it'd be fun if i did right you'd
probably enjoy it more it'd be more
entertaining but really
now let me ask you this
in brainwashing news
brainwashing news
how is it that we have been convinced
that some of the most important news in
the country has to do with what tucker
carlson says or does and chris cuomo
says or does
who are basically competitors right the
two competing networks i th is the time
slots the same
somebody give me a fact check
is chris cuomo's
show the same as tucker carlson's time
slot i think it is right
somebody tell me for sure
um
looks like i got some crackling audio
over on
over on locals
play with my cables a little bit and see
if anything's changes
you'll tell me all right
so if you think that it's natural that
we're all talking about chris cuomo and
tucker carlson when they are the two
opinion people on the two i would say
the most news making entities right now
if if fox or cnn says something's news
then it's news i guess
you've been brainwashed
you've been brainwashed
because
these are not important things
what chris cuomo says about his brother
totally unimportant
what tucker carlson says is very
entertaining and often you know some of
the bravest stuff that's on on tv
but
i don't know that you should treat that
as one of your top priorities but it
feels like it because they're in the
news so just consider that what you
consider to be important
and and worthy of your brain cycles has
been assigned to you
you the the thought that
tucker carlson and chris cuomo
you know that they're the story
as awesome as they both are i think
they're both
uh great at their jobs
individually
uh you've been brainwashed they're not
important
but great they're great at their jobs
i'd like to give you
my impression of talking about the
infrastructure bill
which has gone through some of the first
procedural hurdles
i'm going to try to do this while
staying awake
to the end of the sentence all right so
this i haven't tried this before in
public
so this could be embarrassing but i'm
going to read a sentence about the
infrastructure bill
i'm going to try to remain
awake and conscious
from the beginning of the sentence to
the end of the sentence and see if i can
do that
ready
all right
a 15-hour vodarama which is a procedural
move
uh to pass the framework of the
reconciliation
package
for the infrastructure
were we talking about the infrastructure
bill
or something
something about money or something i
don't know
i don't even remember what we were
talking about
so that's what i have to say about the
infrastructure bill
now
i would put myself
in perhaps the top
let's do a fact check on this let's see
if you'd agree or disagree with this
following assumption i think i'm in the
top five percent of people who follow
the news
i'm not sure that's the same as being
well informed but let's say i'm in the
top five percent of people who follow
most of the big news stories
i have no idea what's in the
infrastructure bill
do you
i mean i i know the headline stuff oh a
bunch of socialism stuff got in there
and
why are we calling this
infrastructure and
and there's some stuff that's in there
but then it's taken out and then the
republicans took it out but then
the messi pelosi might put it in with
reconciliation and what the hell is
reconciliation
anyway does anybody understand what's in
the infrastructure bill
do you know why the public should oppose
the infrastructure bill
because they can't explain it to us
basically you should oppose anything
that nobody will explain to you in a way
that you can understand it in some easy
way
now i have seen i think the new york
times
i've seen some graphs that show what's
in and what's out and i've looked at
those graphs and i didn't really
understand them
somehow they made it too complicated
i feel as if there's some way to tell
this story
that you'd understand
but it hasn't happened
yeah it's like obamacare once something
reaches a level of complication
and the public is essentially
taken out of the process
because we just don't know what's in
there what should be in there how the
process works anything
so i think the public can't help on this
one
that's part of the reason that i think
it's uh whatever optimism you have about
this getting passed
i don't know
i don't know
we'll see
um
so
here's something that
really makes you question the simulation
or reality itself
why is it that the
the idea that you follow the money to
understand what's really happening in
the world
why does it keep working
especially for prediction
even when it doesn't look like it should
be the reason for anything
it keeps working
so this is what i told you about
prediction
even if you think the the main reasons
for why something will or will not
happen in the future
have nothing to do with money
watch how often
the money coincidentally
also predicts
let me give you some examples
um what were the odds that we would need
booster shots
for the vaccinations
which would be wildly profitable
for the people who make booster shots
and the vaccinations
now i don't think the reason
that we need booster shots is because it
was all a plan to make them ineffective
so they could make more money with
booster shots i don't think that's the
reason
but why is it that if you predicted
using money
you would have gotten the right answer
right
let's take another one the therapeutics
we know that if the therapeutics were
excellent and and they all worked
that the vaccination makers would
probably make less money
and the pharma in general would probably
make less money with these
if it turned out that any of the cheap
generics or whatever worked
so it turns out that we're told that the
therapeutics don't work well enough
to make vaccinations unnecessary
now
is the reason they told us that
because of money
i don't think so i think the reason is
that the therapeutics didn't pass
enough scientific you know rigor
i think
but
why did money predict exactly what would
happen
again is it a coincidence
watch how many times you're sure that
the reason is something else
and you're really sure of it
but yet money predicted it
coincidence
i don't know
uh something to watch how about uh
how about afghanistan
given what we were spending there and
given that we weren't really didn't seem
like we were making any major progress
in a permanent solution could you have
predicted that we would eventually move
out of afghanistan because it just cost
too much
yes
yes money would predict
that you couldn't stay there forever
and
what about the future of china
well i think that given the reputational
problem and the likely you know the
wuhan lab connection that's likely to be
demonstrated in
with some
greater level of certainty in the future
i feel like china is doomed
if you were to follow the money
the money says it's going to flow out of
china
because they're they'll just be too
toxic so i'm going to predict as i have
that china's got some big problems like
so big they don't really have any sense
of how big these problems are going to
be
that's what the money says
all right here's some good news i just
saw a video on mashable which is a good
thing to follow on twitter mashable
uh there's a pepper harvesting robot
peppers being the you know the the plant
that makes a big pepper
and they showed the robot it could
identify a pepper and it would know it
was ripe and it would pick it off the
vine
so here's here's what's coming
farming is pretty expensive
and they're a bunch of
risks and expensive
especially if you're doing it outdoors
so if you are if you're doing it
outdoors you got to worry about weeds
bug sprays
weather damage you know flooding and
hurricanes and every every other thing
lack of water
you got to worry about labor costs and
then you got to
you got to ship it from your land to
wherever the city is so you get all
these costs
most of them could go away
if indoor farming became more modular
by modular i mean that you that somebody
makes
uh like the boxable example
a little indoor farm
that can connect you know
side to side with as many other little
indoor farms as you want you can make
you know as long as you want
and
once they get the you know the making of
the actual
farm which is basically just a glass
container with with some
utilities
once you could make those cheaply and in
mass units and then once you've got
um
oh
all right
problem here
i gotta take care of in a
minute all right
um
so i think the cost of farming may go
way down with
okay uh somebody needs to know that i'm
live streaming
right now
um
sorry
see my personal life intrudes sometimes
into my professional
until
uh
okay
looks like we'll be wrapping up here
pretty quickly all right let's uh just
finish a few things uh
uh in brainwashing news we're hearing
that the florida healthcare workers are
exhausted and angry
and
here's the thing
is that good persuasion the people who
want you to get vaccinated are doing
stories about
healthcare workers who are exhausted and
angry will that
will that uh
convince you
that you better get vaccinated because
the health care workers are overworked
nope nope do you know what doesn't
matter to anybody
that your job is hard
right there's nothing that matters less
to other people
than uh your job is really hard you
worked hard today
you have stress
you might have to quit very very hard
long hours
nobody cares
because you know who else has a hard job
you do
everybody thinks their job is hard
so the persuasion we're seeing which is
mostly limited to the health care
nobody cares
you do care if you don't get to go in so
here's what they should do
just like the vietnam war was ended i
think because of all the news coverage
they gave you lots of video and scary
stuff and blood
i think the news people need to park
outside the
emergency rooms
and show the ambulances backed up and
every day just say well here's your
local hospital
ten ambulances backed up if you came
here you'd have to wait five hours
and you'd probably be transferred
somewhere else
that would get your attention
right because you would put yourself in
that in in the ambulance you say oh
shoot
if i need to go there that's my hospital
so i think that would convince you but
you don't care that the doctors are
overworked
we do care i mean
we have empathy for human beings and
stuff
but there's nothing less persuasive than
somebody else's job is hard so stop that
all right um
there we do have a tale of two pandemics
here people think that there's there's
one happening
and i thought the most interesting thing
is i asked some on scientific polls
and 18 of the people who follow me and
answered the poll so it's very
unscientific
said that they knew people had died
personally i've coveted
18 of the people who follow me
know people who died
i've coveted that's a lot
all right but
here's the interesting part i asked the
people another poll
just the people who are who are not
vaccinated
how many people who are not vaccinated
know somebody personally who has died
half as many
closer to 9 10
so there seems to be and this is deeply
unscientific polling but my my curiosity
starts with this
is it that knowing somebody who died of
cohen makes it real to you
because that's persuasion
so the hypnotist says you need to know
somebody who died
or
or it's not going to work you could
digitally age somebody and put them in
the hospital and that would convince
them to
take somebody's actual photo and say
well here's you in the hospital gasping
for air
all right
looks like i'm going to need to go
and
going
right yes
first day of school you can imagine
gotta go
