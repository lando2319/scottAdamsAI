and I would not argue with that
wouldn't argue with it at all because it
might be the best thing that's ever
happened to you and
you won't believe this part but it's
going to get better
yeah yeah it gets better than this
right right I know it's hard to believe
but all you need to make it better is a
copper mugger a glass attacker tells her
Stein the canteen Joker flaska vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now go
very good
well I would like to start with a
an angry screed
against guitars
some of you know I bought myself a nice
guitar and I said to myself how hard
could that be
how hard could it be to play a guitar
and then you find out okay the first
thing you need to know
is you need to deform your fingers so
that they can form a natural claw-like
shapes
though you'll use in a non-obvious claw
like way
now if you have a normal size hand
you need to be able to spread these so
my guitar teacher said try putting a
a tennis ball between these two fingers
like spread them out to which I sat
there and I thought
Are you seriously telling me I have to
deform my body to play an instrument
now I've got a complaint
that goes like this
I'll try to say this without the f word
but I don't think I'm going to be able
to get all the way through it
Serenity Now
and it goes like this
if you invented a musical instrument
or perhaps a sporting event
and you invented that sporting event or
musical instrument
a hundred years ago
maybe every now and then you should take
a look at it see if you could upgrade
the interface
say to yourself I wonder if anything's
improved in the last 100 years
for example when basketball was invented
and they said let's put this hoop at 10
feet
do you think they were saying to
themselves oh this will be fun when
seven foot seven foot tall people
overtake the sport
and the only thing you really finding
out is how tall people are give or take
you know a curry
do you think you would have invented
basketball the same way
hey let's let's invent things where a
seven foot the seven footer will just
stand near the hoop and ruin the game
for the rest of us
hey I'm here to ruin the game for the
rest of you because it wasn't invented
for seven foot tall people didn't see
this coming did you
or how about tennis
apparently you're dumb enough to play
tennis
I was dumb enough to play tennis for 50
years until I quit
um do you know what ruined tennis the
equipment
the game stayed the same
and somebody kept inventing stronger
players and more powerful rackets
until the entire game is some guy with a
arm the size of a tree trunk
serving bullets at the other person and
the other person's like
foreign
that's basically the sport of tennis
every 100 years you should take
a look at your sport and see if
everything has changed to maybe update
it a little bit
all right now
I'm no Elon Musk
but if I were
I would buy all of the guitar making
manufacturers in the world
and I'd say you know what you shouldn't
make any more is an instrument that
requires you to put fingers in a
distorted monster way
around a thing that's way too thick for
your hand and like this
like that don't do that
instead
let me just suggest that each of these
chords could possibly be maybe one
button
yes I know there are more chords than
you could fit with buttons perhaps
but you only need three to do most you
know you could do a lot with three
chords you give me 50 chords one button
a piece
I I think I could learn to play the
guitar
but I wouldn't learn to play the guitar
like this like this deforming my body oh
hey everybody
good news I've been playing the guitar
so long that my hand is now deformed
permanently and now I'm a great guitar
player
look at this look at my smart
all right I just had to get that out of
my system
now can we talk about the news
that that was just point of personal
privilege there sorry
um Joshua steidman has a very
interesting thread you've heard about
these uh seemingly independent attacks
on our grid
so in a few cases people have snipers
have fired bullets into Power grids and
local places but there seems to be some
kind of a maybe a pattern there seems to
be an uptick in what looked to be Rogue
attacks on the infrastructure
now we don't have any evidence that
these are coordinated
but as Joshua is so CL wisely points out
if a foreign country wanted to mess with
us and as he uses this phrase put sand
in our gears
one of the ways you could do it which is
a known understood way to do things is
the intelligence agency from another
unfriendly country
could look for uh Rogue criminal
elements who would be willing to do an
attack for money
and then it wouldn't be obvious where
the attacks were coming from it would
look like a bunch of individual Rogue
terrorists
and
Joshua points out that there's at least
three possibilities here
but they all have to be considered one
is that they are individual attacks and
there's something that's causing more of
them but maybe not anybody coordinating
it
uh
number two
possibility is it's an actual
coordinated attack in which the foreign
government is trying to hurt the United
States and it's just about hurting us
as possible the other possibility is the
funny one
that there's a foreign country that's
trying to send us a message that they
could destroy our grid anytime they want
to
but we're not getting the message
because it's too indirect it's too
subtle like okay are they trying to send
us a message
because they look like individual
attacks but they do have something in
common
but we don't know who would be sending
the message
so so it might actually be one
possibility is it's a failed attempt to
send a message that somebody could take
us out if they want to and we're not
getting it
now I don't know which one to bet on
but I but I like I like the way of
thinking that says Don't eliminate
don't eliminate all the possibilities
like you need to look into it a little
bit
all right
um
so have you ever heard me say for those
of you who are new to my live stream
can the people been watching me for a
while how many times have I said that in
the long run the United States and
Russia are natural allies the actual
phrase the word natural allies
can you confirm that I've said that way
too many times I've said that so many
times
well today in the news
uh freed Russian arms dealer Victor bout
he's the one who was traded for
um Griner the WNBA player so he's free
now he had been an American jail for his
uh arms dealing which were pretty bad
because he armed a lot of African and
other countries that killed a lot of
people
but it turns out that uh Victor the
dangerous Russian arms dealer is very
pro-american
he's very he's very pro-american he
speaks really good English with an
accent but it's really good English
and in jail he said he would he would
hang around with a number of Rural uh
people I don't know why he mentioned
rural but he probably because they were
white now that I think about it but he
said he hung around with a lot of rural
people you know Americans and he said
they were great he goes they all they
were all interested in Russia nobody had
any bad feelings about Russia he had no
bad feelings about Americans loves
Americans
and and he said he actually used the
same phrase he said that Russia and the
United States are natural allies
did you see that coming
like who had that on their bingo card
freed Russian arms dealer says U.S and
America are natural allies and we should
maybe maybe Yak that way
Scott doesn't say we are natural allies
first I'm here again since 2017.
so there's somebody out here who says I
I've never said that
but there are plenty of people who've
heard me say it probably 12 times
yeah I've said it a lot
so I don't know if that means anything
but it's interesting to have a
famous Russian arms dealer agree with me
because if you don't have a famous
Russian arms dealer agreeing with your
live stream well you need to work harder
try to get them on your side
today is full of actually really
interesting news like like the kind
where you just say really really
that is that true all right here's
another one uh I believe you know Daniel
Ellsberg from the was the Pentagon
papers right so he had some he had some
secret
um U.S government documents
and uh so that was you know famous story
of Daniel Ellsberg so Danny Ellsberg now
is uh quite elderly I don't know how old
he is but he looks like he's around
80-ish right
and here's something we just learned
apparently Assange gave Daniel Ellsberg
a full copy of all the Chelsea Manning
stuff that Wikileaks had
just in case
So Daniel Ellsberg had the full copy the
whole time of everything that Assange
had had produced and the reason that
he'd given it to else
Berg
the reason he'd given to dellsburg is as
a emergency backup
because he was the one person that he
trusted to get it out to the public
that's kind of amazing isn't it and
we're just fighting to get out and then
here's the you know the the added boost
on top of it
Ellsberg is saying that if Assange is is
guilty
of Simply possessing the documents
because I think I don't know the
specific legal argument here but I think
the the argument is that simply
possessing
these secret documents is a crime
and Ellsberg is saying if that's a crime
you better indict me
because I have them
right
he
illegally has these documents but he
would say that he legally has them
because they were given to him by
somebody he did not steal them
so that's legal if you're not the
stealer I guess now he makes the point
that if this were Great Britain it would
definitely be illegal because they have
a specific law that says you can't have
any secret government documents that's
my understanding but Ellsberg points out
that in the United States we don't have
that law
and simply possessing the documents is
not a crime and he'd be willing to test
it like he's actually he's begging for
the you know let's bring it on let's
test this in court
how much do you love that
well like this this is the America that
I want to live in right this little
scenario
where somebody has some information they
thought it'd be good for the citizens
they found the most trustworthy citizen
they could find on this topic according
to Assange apparently gave him the
documents had a good backup plan and
then the backup plan
is working not exactly the way Assange
planned but in a different way
it's working
in other words Ellsberg now just he
entered the fight
if he had not had those documents
Ellsberg is 91 thank you Ellsberg is 91.
if Ellsberg we're not 91 and still
willing to fight
this would look different
this would look different
all right
uh so here's what I tentatively favor
but I'm going to tell you that I'm not
fully informed on the whole Assange
wikileak thing I feel like I might have
some uh dark Corners there that need a
little light in my understanding but
here's where I'm at
I'd like to see a public trial
I mean I don't even know if that's an
option but would we be able to see the
trial or would it be a bunch of secret
stuff so it have to be behind closed
doors if it's behind closed doors I
don't favor it at all
if it's if it's going to be open to the
public as much as possible then I say
let's test it
let's I don't even know why Assange is
so concerned about
um
extradition
because it's not like he's a free person
I feel like it's his only path to
Freedom
and if his only path to Freedom would
also give us you know American citizens
the things we want to know
I feel like that's a win-win does
anybody see a problem with that what
would be the problem with just putting
him in court and let us letting us see
how it plays out
you might be abstained
but doesn't he have that risk already I
mean would he be in more more danger
here than wherever he is I mean anybody
can get to him anywhere
you've been yelling power cords at me
I've been playing the power chords but
even the power chords you need these two
fingers to be further apart than a
normal hand
so I hear what you're saying I was
practicing my power chords yesterday
um
anyway
so let's keep an eye on that
uh here's a funny not a funny story a
horrible story I'm sorry
did I say it was funny this is a tragic
horrible story
about a nurse in Germany
who was gave 8600 patients a saline shot
when they thought they were getting a
coven vaccination so apparently this
nurse was anti-vaxx anti-covet vacs and
was giving people saline instead of the
vaccination and so she got convicted
and she'll let them serve some time I
guess
and here's the or no I get no she won't
serve time I think it was a
suspended sentence or something I don't
know but she's got some kind of penalty
um but is there anything uh Missing in
the story
now apparently she admitted that she
gave some sales injections but then they
thought wait it's probably more than
some and then they started testing all
the people who had bender and they found
out that they didn't have antibodies for
the vaccination
so so you determined there's 8 600
people who should have been vaccinated
and weren't and mostly they were over
70. so it was actually the most
vulnerable population
now is there anything missing in the
story
any any dogs not barking
thank you that's right
did uh
did anybody
s the 8600 people
how did it work out
[Laughter]
how'd it work out
because you know what is conspicuously
missing in a story about somebody who's
in legal Jeopardy What's conspicuously
missing
what was the cost or the outcome of the
bad behavior
we know 8600 people got a shot and then
we can say for sure about the 8 600
people what could we say for sure
they did not have vaccination
complications
right we can say that for sure
we know that the nurse reduced the risk
of complications
now
don't you think they had an obligation
to ask if anybody was worse off
do they have worse outcomes
did they get covered and die
have a suspicion
that the data does not support the
prosecution
because if it did and they actually
talked to all 8 600 people because I
think they had to talk to the 8 600
people
to test them for antibodies
they had extended conversations right
so isn't that kind of conspicuously
missing
I'm just saying it's just not there
all right another Amazing Story like the
the news is just full of Amazing Stories
today there's a whistleblower Dr Hoff
who worked in the Wuhan lab from 2014 to
2016 including being vice president at
one point so he's a high ranking
Wuhan lab American
who says absolutely
the U.S government is to blame for the
transfer of dangerous biotech to the
Chinese
in other words America is blaming China
is blaming the U.S
and they were both in on it
that's what the Whistleblower says they
were in on it together
ouch
now
have I told you that every time there's
a conspiracy theory
lately it seems we're finding out it's
exactly what you thought it was
the worst thing you could have assumed
about the Wuhan lab is the worst thing
you could you could assume that it was
all China it was just China
did it and they're lying about is that
the worst that you could assume because
that's really bad that would be bad no
is the worst you could assume that was
really America and we were blaming China
and mostly getting away with it that'd
be bad
I mean that'd be very very bad
but you know what would be worse than
that
if the United States and China were
completely aware that it was both of us
and and we just agreed to blame each
other so that nobody was quite sure
I feel like it was the worst case
scenario I don't know if it could be any
worse
what could be worse
now
let's back up a little bit do you
believe the Whistleblower
what is The credibility of The
Whistleblower it looks like his
credentials are solid
it looks like he was in the right place
at the right time
roughly 2016 I don't know if that's the
right time
it looks credible to me
but there is one one knock against it
it's a pretty big knock so there's one
Mark against his credibility what is it
what's the mark against his credit yeah
follow the money exactly he's writing a
book
and
so here's somebody who's allegedly an
American citizen
I say allegedly because he didn't act
like one
you didn't act like one if he waited
until now to publish his book
for us to know what was going on with
the pandemic
I don't trust him at all
he has no credibility in my in my view
if you're that much of a
you you are you're not credible he could
be right he could be right like I'm not
saying he's wrong I'm saying that I
wouldn't believe it because this
guy said it
because here's somebody you just threw
the whole country under the bus to write
a book
because we kind of needed to know that
if it's true right so I would say
credibility low
low unfortunately I love I'd love for
his gratitude ability to be high and I
don't know if there's any other you know
any other knock on his credibility I
don't know about his background or his
history but just that one thing
anytime you hear that somebody saves
their Blockbuster whistleblower thing
for the book
that's just a big hit on your
credibility yeah that's a big hit
so we'll wait on that
um I contend
that one of the worst things that came
out of World War II
aside from 60 million people dying
aside from the Holocaust
aside from all of that
there is a ripple effect from World War
II that is really really hurting us is
the fact that we can't make any
decisions without comparing comparing it
to Hiller
how good is our decision making if we
can't make any decisions without a
Hitler analogy
it's completely crippled
yeah we are permanently under PTSD
because all we can see is Hitler
everywhere it's just Hitler Hitler
Hitler if you can't make any political
argument without a Hitler analogy
there's no critical thinking happening
at all you're just hitlerized you're so
hillarized so that's like a permanent
PTSD that Society had and it really is
hurting us
because we can't have anything like an
even
partially rational discussion
if if one side is saying Hitler Hitler
we'll get to more of that more of that
later so Michael schellenberger is the
third independent journalist who got
access to the Twitter files
so now we've seen Matt taibi and Barry
Weiss and now Michael schellenberger I
assume musk was the one who personally
selected or approved the journalists
because they have something in common
they're all people who at one point were
associated with the left
who got a little frustrated with the
arguments on the left and though you
would not call them Republicans because
they wouldn't call themselves
Republicans you could say oh here are
three people that we know can see both
sides of an argument
that alone
if nothing else comes out of this
Twitter stuff if the only thing that
comes out of this is that there were
three independent journalists you could
believe
and I say believe not because they will
get every fact right for the rest of
their lives that's not a realistic
expectation but you could believe them
that they're not intending to lie
they're not intending to lie there are
people who have a history of intending
to just let you know what's true
that's very big and I think it's bigger
than the Twitter Story by far imagine if
you will yeah it could be that the whole
sub stack situation
is is really positive because it could
create a virtual independent journalism
I guess it has virtual independent
journalism tool
that the public might actually go to for
some some good information
so something really good is developing
there anyway so Sheldon Berger who has
my highest confidence for being an
independent journalist
um
he reports he was he was a test with
only reporting for the few days I think
around right after January 6th and one
of the big things we found is that uh a
number of people were calling for Trump
to be kicked off the platform including
uh Michelle Obama
and the I think the ADL and some others
so there were calls for him to be kicked
off
so here here are the people we know
Twitter targeted and you can help me
fill in the blanks we know Twitter
targeted Trump
Dan bongino
um
the libs of tick tock the lips of tick
tock
um James Wood
and who else
uh Jordan I didn't see that but oh
Charlie Kirk
Charlie Kirk
and who else is confirmed
Babylon B well we know the answering
Matt Gates is Matt Gates confirmed Roger
Stone confirmed I haven't seen those
confirmed
confirmed could you send me if you if
there's anything that confirms other
people like Matt Gates and stone could
you send the uh well Breitbart is
confirmed right
breitbarts MGT she confirmed I mean
there's things we saw in the public
but have we confirmed it from the
Twitter files that they were targeted
okay
oh you'll send me Matt Gates thank you
so
um so here's the thing
uh oh there's so many angles to this
let's take the yellow Roth and go first
as you know Joel Roth was in charge of
who got banned on Twitter and he seemed
to be operating somewhat independently
with at least one other executive and
maybe Jack Dorsey wasn't in the loop on
some of this stuff so so we know that
there was stuff happening outside of
Jack dorsey's
Direct Control or direct intervention or
something I guess
so that much we know
um
but it turns out
that the old Roth when he was I think
working on his PhD
wrote a paper and I'm going to be very
careful about how I talk about this
okay he wrote a paper about the app
grinder I don't know I don't know what
the bigger topic was but the part we
know about he talks about the app
grinder which is for gay people to do
hookups
and he mentioned that there were
underage people
who were not legally allowed on the app
but they would sneak on so there were a
lot of young people under 18 on the app
in his paper
he asked the question
is it you know should we only be working
on getting them off the app or is there
a way to take into consideration that
they're going to get on the app no
matter what
and that maybe you should treat them in
some way that's better for society
is there any positive way to make it
better keeping underage people on a sex
app
now
from a purely academic perspective
is that a fair question
from a purely academic perspective which
is the context is that a fair question
yes it is of course it is it's a fair
question because the question is how do
you reduce harm to children
and I I don't think he had a conclusion
I think he said we we have to at least
be realistic and say they're already
being harmed is there anything you can
do to help
right
my sound is good at my end so if there's
something happening I can't control it
so
all right so
um somebody researched that and found
out that that was in his background
and then Elon Musk actually tweeted it
Elon Musk actually tweeted
that it explains a lot
it explains a lot that the guy in charge
of who gets kicked off the system
had had written a paper questioning
whether children should be on a sex app
now remember Twitter was also being
accused of not taking seriously enough
the pedophiles that were active on on
Twitter
so you see that this all ends up looking
like the same thing
so
I would like to point out
that Elon Musk now holds the record
for the most extreme firing of an
employee I've ever seen
sometimes you just get fired oh we have
to downsize I'm sorry you'll have to go
bad enough I mean that's a bad day
but imagine being fired
and then within a week the person who
fired you ouch you on Twitter as
pedophile friendly
that is more fired than anybody has ever
been fired you can't get fired harder
than that
now let me very quickly
say that there is no accusation
that Joel Roth was involved in any way
with any underage
promotion of kids or activity right
there is no no evidence
that he personally is friendly with
any better stuff right I want to be as
clear as possible I don't think he's
been accused
and there's no evidence I've seen that
was suggested whatsoever
you're worried but that's a different
different subject
but it does seem to it does seem to be
true
there's someone with a documented
background
of being let's say flexible
flexible with underage stuff
was in charge of making sure there
wasn't any on
or at least he was one of the people who
could have been involved in getting rid
of the pedo stuff on Twitter
now that's about as bad as you can
that's like the worst situation you can
even imagine
but the fact that musk actually tweeted
that out
I've that's the most aggressive firing
I've ever seen in my life I've never
seen anybody fired harder than that
that's as fired as you can get
wow so
um
here's the question
did Jack Dorsey lie to Congress I just
watched the clip of it
and
he was asked
if let's see what was the exact question
does Twitter quote
try to censor conservative voices
does Twitter
censor conservative voices
and Jack said no
and he was sitting right next to the
person who was in charge of the sensory
is that a lie
well what would be the evidence what
would be the evidence that Twitter
censors conservatives what's the
evidence we've seen so far
we've seen Trump you know Kirk bongino
and they're they're all Republicans
right or at least conservatives
true or false 100 of the people we know
have been targeted that we know
just once we know are all conservatives
true
true right is it also true that each of
them had a specific uh terms of service
infraction or could be interpreted as an
infraction is that true or not
uh Barrington was not conservative but
he was certainly siding with him in this
oh yes false right
so here's the question
in in terms of a courtroom
if somebody says I have a 10 examples of
conservatives who were banned
but we use an excuse in each case there
was like a specific
harm that we called out
that these 10 people were engaged in
so does that prove if you know that
those ten things are true
or even 20. whatever it is if you know
that there are 10 absolutely confirmed
cases where people were were Shadow
banned
does that mean that they had a policy of
Shadow Banning conservatives if you knew
those were all true all 10 of them
and you knew that there was no example
not one example of a Democrat being
unfortunately it's just examples it's
just examples
right and those examples could be
explained another way just as easily
so what explanation is that Twitter
conspired and we're consciously trying
to suppress conservatives and everything
that happened looks exactly like that
right
well I I definitely would agree that
what we've seen looks exactly like
that's true
but suggestive of in other words there's
nothing that's counterfactual to it
there's nothing that rules it out it
certainly looks at it looks exactly like
it
but the evidence we have
only supports that they acted that way
which is different than a policy
and why would they act that way unless
they had a policy
why would everybody act the same way
unless there was a policy
and the answer is more obvious than a
policy because they were all Democrats
they just had the same worldview so when
they looked for harm they all saw it in
the same place
and when they look for harm caused by
democrats they just didn't see it
so their job was to get rid of harm
so they got rid of the harm they could
see
which to them was all a bunch of
conservative stuff they did not get rid
of the harm that they didn't see
because to them it didn't look harmful
and so is that would that be considered
um Twitter having a let's say a policy
of discriminating against conservatives
because if Jack says no we don't have
the policy
I don't see anything that says that's a
lie
because no document has said let's get
these conservatives
no person has no person has testified
that yes we were after conservatives so
you have no you have no testimony and no
documents
that would refute what Jack said in
Congress there's no counter factual the
only the only evidence you have is not
conclusive it's anecdotal
anecdotal evidence has no
um
no legal value really unless unless
there's just tons of it and then you can
make a a case you know based on uh
circumstantial evidence but this this is
not even close to that level
this is one anecdote that's just
repeated
now you imagine imagine a jury trial
imagine you took just what you have now
and you didn't learn anything else and
you took a jury you said hey Jerry we
found all these cases of conservatives
being suppressed and no cases of anybody
else being suppressed so there's our
case
and then then what does the jury say in
their minds they say well where's this
information come from
how do we know it's just 10
conservatives who told us oh three
people who are identified as being
friendly to the right
told us
that the left was discriminating that
that's how you know your source is only
people on the right
looked at things you haven't looked at
and we can't see we don't know if they
skipped anything we just know that they
only told us about the people on the
right which is exactly what people who
lean right would tell you
you see that you could never get a you
can never get a conviction
based on what you have now
right
now I'm definitely not telling you
that I know whether Twitter did or did
not you know collude or scheme to take
down Democrats or take down Republicans
I don't know anything you know certainly
we found anything's possible like every
other news story teaches this this
lesson you know those people you thought
you could trust
and not so much that's like every news
story
every news story is the same
so
um I'd like to talk to you about the bad
arguments on my team
my team is the following
my team is anybody who thinks that
Twitter did some things that were bad
at least in terms of the outcome and
would like to know more about it and
thinks we need to be kind of aggressive
and getting to the bottom of it that's
my team and my team also thinks that
there are probably some bad things that
happened right but what I don't like is
when people agree with me on the big
picture
have arguments that are absurd
so I'm going to talk about the people
who agree with me
that Twitter did a bad thing and we need
to figure out how to stop it and you
know know what happened don't do the
following arguments
I don't like the argument that Jack lied
to Congress because we don't have
evidence of that we have evidence that
he said said things we have only
evidence that he talked
evidence that somebody talked and said
something you didn't think they should
have said is not evidence of a crime
we don't know why he knew right because
that's important what did Jack know
because there's plenty of evidence in
the documentation that he was not
brought into all of the decisions he was
brought into the top ones but not all
so I don't like the argument that Jack
lied unless you have some evidence and
there's no evidence he lied
it might be true but no evidence has
been presented so that's what we
argument
uh which could turn out it could turn
into a strong argument if we had
different information but with what we
have how about this one people said I
noted that
it appeared from the Internal
Documentation
that the people who worked at Twitter
believed they were doing something good
for the country would you agree
now it's not your opinion
but from what we've seen doesn't it look
like they thought they were doing the
right thing
and then people said to me Scott Scott
oh you are so on the wrong place on this
it doesn't matter what they thought why
why doesn't it matter what they were
thinking
why why is it irrelevant that they
thought they were doing the right thing
go ahead say it
say it
say it
there you go thank you
Hitler
because we're poisoned by Hitler and
allergies
we can't think of this correctly
we don't have the capability to look at
this situation in any rational way
because we're all crippled
we're all crippled by Hitler
that's all we can say
if all you see is Hitler in this
situation
you're not you're not putting any kind
of critical thought on it you're just
Hitler poisoned
so anybody anybody who brings up Hitler
in any situations that's not literally
actually the Holocaust
they just have Hitler poisoning and you
should ignore everything they say
it's just Hitler poisoning
now some people said to me Scott
it doesn't matter that they had good
intentions in their own mind right it
only matters how they acted
because because the Hitler argument
those Nazis thought they were doing
maybe something good for the world
so just like Nazis right
Twitter employees Nazis exactly the same
they thought they were doing something
good but you can't you CA you can't you
can't excuse them for that can you
because I was told that people's
intentions are irrelevant
if what they do is evil they must be
held accountable for the evil their
internal thoughts are irrelevant to that
right would everybody agree with that
that it's what they do that matters is
not what they're thinking their internal
intentions and what do you agree that
internal intentions don't have any any
role in the legal system
would you agree that the legal system
does not care what your internal
thinking is it only cares what you did
right and that's why we treat
self-defense the same as murder
so if you kill somebody in self-defense
let's say you blow their head off that's
why they put you in jail for exactly the
same amount as if you murdered them with
premeditation
because your intention doesn't make any
difference in the legal system it only
matters that you killed somebody
what
what oh you're saying that those are
treated differently
oh oh so now you're changing your
opinion that the intention of the ACT
actually is completely determinative of
how you're treated huh
please don't tell me that the intention
doesn't matter
the intention is all that matters
it's all that matters
for understanding how to how to deal
with it how to fix it whether or not
there's any legal repercussions
the intention is all that matters it's
like way way the most important thing
because
um
in all likelihood
in all likelihood what we've found out
so far is exactly what Jack Dorsey told
you
a year ago
a year ago Jack Dorsey told you we have
too many Democrats and so we're probably
acting like
Democrats when we're making decisions
I mean I'm paraphrasing but he said that
directly and I think probably more than
once
he even Jack Dorsey said whoa we got too
many lefties here
so we're acting like a lefty
organization when that was never the
point of it like he didn't approve of it
he used he used that as a criticism of
his own entity that it was too Lefty
now
here are two possibilities to how
everything you saw could happen
one possibility it was an explicit
Twitter policy to suppress conservatives
and that would fit everything you've
seen would you agree
a hundred percent of what you've seen so
far would be compatible with that theory
that they were actually literally
knowingly
just suppressing opinions they didn't
like
totally offensive facts
here's something else that fits the
facts
nothing like that was happening but they
were all Democrats
and so they just saw the world through a
Democrat lens when they looked at Trump
they saw a monster
when they looked at
um I know grooming as you would say
grooming in schools maybe they just saw
a progressive sexual education
it didn't look dangerous to them maybe
when you saw antifa you saw a domestic
terror group
maybe they saw protesters for
black lives matter like you know good
people and a good cause
couldn't you get to the same place
it wouldn't wouldn't everything you've
seen be explained just by having lots of
Democrats there
couldn't you explain all of it
with that
because you can very easily there you
don't even there's no stretch there's no
spin there's no pretzel logic it's just
right down the middle
how about everybody was a Democrat and
so they acted like Democrats
or it's a big old conspiracy and they
were secretly trying to change the
country but yet it didn't show up in any
of their documentation and there's not a
single whistleblower not a single
whistleblower
says yeah we talked about it we're just
trying to put down the conservatives not
one there's not one whistleblower in all
of Twitter
really no no one whistleblower to say oh
yeah we actually just talked about this
privately and it was just all about
expressing not one
now maybe we get one
now and I want to be as clear as
possible later when you tell me I'm
wrong
if new information comes up no you're
wrong again that would be you being
wrong twice
if new information comes out then I
might change my opinion
based on the new information
that's not wrong I'm telling you we
don't know
what's going on because we don't have
the information so don't act like you
know when you don't know
right so if later we know then I'll say
oh yeah now we know
all right
um
all right
uh and so we've now seen any direct
evidence that uh Twitter was targeting
conservatives we've seen anecdotes which
are very convincing
and could mean that they had said it
directly but we're short of that
standard
um
yeah see
Ellen more to that point
um what is your point of view on the
following three things if you complain
that the 2020 election looked rigged
are you trying to protect the public or
destroy It Go
the the people who said 2020 was rigged
are they trying were they trying to
protect the republic or destroy it
sort of the point of view isn't it
people on the right say they're
protecting it people on the left side
they're destroying it
how about if you were a January sixer
and you protested were you trying to
overthrow the republic or were you
trying to protect it we tried to
overthrow the protect the republic or
protector
conservatives would say Protect
Democrats would say overthrow
and likewise if you were Twitter were
you trying to protect the public or were
you trying to rig an election
if you were the Twitter employees we
were trying to protect the country or a
Reagan election
both maybe both
yeah maybe both those are not really
separable
there's news that uh Trump turned down a
prisoner swap for that arms dealer I
talked about Victor bout for just Paul
Whalen so before the WNBA player was
nabbed
Trump had the offer
of the Arms Dealer for the ex-marine and
he turned it down
according to John Bolton
is John Bolton an accurate source for
Trump related behind the scenes
information no no he's not no so there
may be some context here that's missing
now I would not be surprised if he
turned down the deal
but that's there's a big difference
between that
and you know the the simple version
we're hearing there may be more to it so
I don't know could be technically true
but missing some detail
all right here's some really interesting
uh events you might know that Kerry lake
has filed a lawsuit about the midterms
and her Arizona situation
and
part of her filing
includes the claim
that they they got an expert on voting
machines and they specifically got an
expert on
um
they specifically got an expert on these
kinds of voting machines right so Kerry
Lake
guess an expert on these kinds of voting
machines and the expert says that the
mass problems they had with the voting
machines on Election Day
could not have been created
unintentionally
what
from a technical perspective it couldn't
have been an accident
now
that's one of those opinions that
you know you could imagine another
experts say oh yeah it could be an
accident let me explain how so you can
imagine there might be a counter to that
but that's the claim somebody with
extensive knowledge of those specific
machines says that exact problem could
not be happening by accident that that
can only happen by a human intervention
intentionally
now of course this is not proof this is
just the evidence being offered up
but here's what's interesting Rich
Barris who on Twitter goes by The
People's pundit and he was very involved
in the election irregularity claims and
he tweeted this and I don't know if you
could maybe you couldn't have done this
a year ago but he said the 2022 Arizona
midterm elections were not conducted
legitimately now keep in mind he said
that on Twitter
could you say that on Twitter a year ago
could you
I feel like you would have been kicked
off right kicked off at Twitter but
there it is but then he follows it up
and I think this gives it a little extra
weight he says I have no problem
extending invites to publicly
debate me over the fact all fake gurus
are welcome to apply
a word of caution this is from Rich
Barris he says you're not as smart as
you think you are and I'm going to
embarrass you
laughs
that's a pretty uh gutsy claim isn't it
now how long have I been saying we need
some kind of a national level
debate show a podcast or live stream
Where where outside of the government we
can actually have a real debate without
weird time limits where people just you
know talk until the time's up and have
actually maybe people fact checking and
like a real debate where the point of it
is not to win the debate
the point of it is to find out what's
true
which would look different than a debate
debates are artificial contests that are
not they're not designed to tell you
what's true
it's an artificial contest what you want
is something to help you know it's true
so the debate would be the sort of the
surface level
but below that you need to have the
experts and researchers sitting right
there at the same time and then when
somebody makes a claim they also are
clacking away on their laptops and then
they go okay you made this following
claim here's a study that backs you
here's a study that debunks you you know
here's what's good and bad about those
two studies
then we know something
right then we would know something
but the people I don't want to see a
debate are I just saw a Newt Gingrich
and Ann Coulter did some debate against
some Democrats
I don't want to see that
because as soon as you put Newt Gingrich
around Coulter it's all about them
right it's no longer about the issue
it's about those two people you can't
have that kind of person
trying to tell you what's true because
they're they're too identifiable with a
position you want somebody who looks
like they don't care which way it ends
up someone who legitimately says you
know I'm just following the facts so
wherever this lands it lands and then
we'll deal with it because I just want
what's good for the country you want
people like that
people could actually change their mind
in public
you are somebody who's so intellectually
honest that if they lost a debate in
public they would say it
like right in front of you
like that would be a rare person a very
rare person oh yeah you just basically
you just wiped the floor with me yeah
you won that debate yep that point you
made I had not considered and that
changes my mind
surely there are some people like that
somewhere in the world it'd be good to
see them debate
so
um I would
I would like to boost Rich barris's uh
offer and I do think he knows enough to
be a good person to have the debate now
I don't know him personally
but what I've been following suggests
that he's fact-based
so fact-based that I can imagine I don't
know it's but I can imagine
that if you were in a debate and he lost
they might actually just say it oh yeah
did my best these claims look like they
were pretty suspicious but now your
argument makes sense and I accept that I
think he could do it now that's pretty
optimistic isn't it
do you think I could do it
do you think I could be in a debate in
which I was really strongly held a
position but in the course of the debate
in public could I change my mind if I
got undebated yes I could
yes I could do that
yep
I could do that right in front of you
and the reason I could do it is I've
created a a brand that allows it
so I would not be
um I would not be going counter to my
self-image or the image that you have of
me if I changed my mind in public in
fact that would be on brand wouldn't it
for me that would be totally on brand
Alan dershowitz same thing they just saw
his name in the comments if Alan
dershowitz did a public debate
and somebody bested him in the debate
I believe he would say it
and he would say it before the debate
was over I think he'd say you know what
I came here honestly thinking I had the
stronger argument
after 60 Minutes of hearing the other
side I actually changed my mind and I
think you should consider that that that
that was a superior argument
dershowitz could say that do you know
why
because he's created a brand for himself
where that's allowed
Geraldo can do it too Heraldo could do
that because he also has a brand
where he can say oh I'm going to follow
the information
yeah
but do you notice how few people you
could come up with
that you would trust could change their
mind
right in front of you very very small
number of people and the only reason
they could
is because they've created the brand
expectation that they're people who can
follow the data wherever it goes even at
the even at the risk of embarrassment
and even at the risk of
you know personal whatever I see Victor
David Hanson being mentioned I'm going
to question that one not because of Any
criticism of him but because I'm not
aware of any uh anything used on this
counter to
counter to let's say the rights
narrative if he has that if he has that
background
then yes you would add him to the list
but I'm not aware of it
um
Tim Poole
somebody suggests maybe I don't know
um
offered to debate Trump on persuasion
well I don't think he and I would debate
anything
you know Greenwald is now
Greenwald may have passed too far into
the uh
right-leaning part of the world
it's been a long time since I saw a
Greenwald disagree with the right
it's been a long time
and while I have uh ultimate respect for
greenwald's reporting even though I
don't like him personally
which I think is important to say
because it I think that helps my
credibility I don't like Greenwald
personally because he you know he wants
to try to slap me down on Twitter and I
didn't think it was a legitimate
so I just have a personal grudge against
it because he's basically a dick
but the work that he does I think is so
valuable for the country
that I have you know ultimate respect
for his professional work you just might
be sort of a dick but I'm pretty sure
that's common to a lot of people
maybe even me
maybe even me
um
why do you believe assessment of who
they're all subjective
well it's not a question of who I'd
believe
it's a question of are there some people
that you know could change their opinion
in front of you
and I think there are some people that
you could know that with some certainty
and I'm one of them and I think
dershowitz is another you know what do
you say Tim Poole you're starting to get
into I don't know I I would like to
think you would like I have a general
positive feeling about Temple so I think
maybe you would but I think that
dershowitz is a guarantee
and I think I'm a guarantee
because we've both done it we've both
done it in public
Tucker changed on Iraq yeah years later
years later you know that's an
interesting one could Tucker change his
mind in real time he changed his mind in
Iraq but that seemed to be after the
fact
could Joe Rogan Joe Rogan could yeah Joe
Rogan could could Russell Brand yes
could Steve Crowder hmm there's an
interesting one
I don't know I have no reason to think
he couldn't but that's different from
saying there's evidence to suggest
that he would
that's a little bit different because
there are a number of people I would say
well I have no reason to think they
wouldn't change their mind but they
don't have any history of it
that I'm aware of right how about Jon
Stewart
yeah
he could Jon Stewart could
Tulsi could of course
yeah isn't it interesting though I feel
like we need a almost a separate
category
for people who are
for people who could change their mind
doesn't it seem like that's something
useful
because if you listen to people who
can't change their mind what are you
listening to
you're not listening to anything useful
you're listening to propaganda
right
yeah the the weinsteins another two good
two good examples the Weinstein's based
on
I believe just you know intellectual
honesty
I think they just have a higher
principle for intellectual honesty so I
think they would go wherever the
wherever the data went
that's my impression
Dr Drew same thing Dr Jews he's a he has
a history of being able to take a hit
by not saying the popular thing so he's
got a long history of going where he
feels the data is going so that's a good
one
[Music]
um
yeah all right well I don't want to I
don't want to mention too many names
um and I see all the you clankers I do
see your comments
it's just not something I want to
interact with
so but um I do see your comments so if
you thought you weren't being seen I can
tell you that you are being seen
all right
and then Kerry Lake responded to Rich
Barris saying he wanted to do a public
debate she said I'd pay to watch this
debate
now
is it isn't that the
the thing
I would pay to watch this debate
I would pay to watch that debate
I would pay actual money
10 bucks
but I definitely pay a dollar
imagine you don't think there's any
podcaster who's willing to host a debate
that people probably a million people
would pay a dollar for
to do you know two hours at work and you
make a million dollars
somebody's saying that sticks into him
are clarified within 48 hours so I
should unblock him
what's the what clarification could
there be if I think he's a dick
how do you clarify that
um I'm not interested
he didn't mean to insult me
no he meant to be condescending
he he wrote something which was clearly
intended to be condescending
yeah it takes one to no one yeah
that's true takes one to no one
now here so here's the thing
it wasn't his first offense
and when people speak to me in a
condescending way
I have a right to take them out of my
out of my attention span forever
it doesn't matter to me that he doesn't
like it that's not really
be a man
be a man all right here's a good
question
is it more manly just to make your
decision move on
or is it more manly to keep revisiting
your decision
which is more manly
I don't think anything's more manly
um Let me let me give you a little micro
lesson about something I think that
maybe this applies
any of you have the following philosophy
of life
and I'll give you the alternative
the first philosophy is once you've made
a decision
you just move on
and there are other people who make a
decision but it's never really made it's
always Revisited forever maybe maybe
maybe right
um
I I take the decision and move on
and then when somebody says you've made
a wrong decision and here's why
even if I believe them
I move on anyway
I move on anyway and that's really hard
to explain
other people do and I'm not even sure if
it's uh irrational
it's just that my experience of life is
that moving forward is always better
than not
and that as soon as you're in your
analysis paralysis that's all bad but
moving forward the wrong way
can at least help you adjust you know if
you run into a wall you adjust but I
always I always say okay we're done with
that decision
and it's really hard if you're making
decisions with women like a partner
because women will often say accurately
oh new information has emerged
let's go re-look at this decision and
then I say I don't go backwards
I'm going to make a new problem with my
new decision and then I'll fix that
because that's in the future
but I'm not going to go back I just
don't go backwards and boy this is a
this isn't a relationship killer let me
tell you
I don't recommend it to you at all it's
a total relationship killer because try
to explain to somebody you shouldn't do
something that's obviously right
well you obviously made the wrong
decision based on this new information
why in the world wouldn't you go back
and rethink it
because
I don't go backwards
I just don't go backwards I'll go fix
the new thing that I made worse but I'm
not going to go backwards
is it is that a good way to be I don't
know I really don't know
you took a massive l
for
what
sounds like an excuse
uh wonderful we'll ever find the real
story about the hammer and Pelosi
I think we do know the real real story
about that Pelosi the the part that
everybody's confused about is not
confusing at all
because they say that Pelosi answered
the door
and the police didn't see any immediate
problems
and that the Pelosi let them in
and it was only them that the bad guy
grabbed the hammer and and hit Pelosi
but
isn't it obvious exactly what happened
Pelosi was engaged in the crazy guy in
conversation to to stall and you know to
keep it as non-violent as possible he
had the hammer in his hand just in case
but he was clearly talking to the crazy
guy like a friend
and he wanted to maintain that feel
to keep the violence low so when the
police entered he said you know my
friend here
you know here's my friend because
they've been talking for a while now
so you want to you want to present him
as a friend to keep the violence down
here's my friend
and then when the crazy guy realized
that he was going to be in trouble
and that this was an arrest not just a
conversation he went nuts on Pelosi for
calling the police
how is that not obvious
now I'm not saying it's the true story
because anything could sound right and
not be true but it's the most obvious
explanation why would you reject the
obvious explanation
yeah that's the obvious explanation if
there's more to it well
that's the world we live in we wouldn't
be that surprised
why do I have so many clankers here this
is because you're all mad that a block
sticks and Hammer
so the the clankers are uh fans of
sticks and Hammer who I blocked the
other day for being the dick
and I think that
can can we all agree that it doesn't
matter
does anybody care who I block on Twitter
and for what reason does their personal
reasons
I'm not trying to say that you should
block him
it was just a personal decision it was a
very personal decision has nothing to do
with politics nothing to do with his
opinion
it's just personal
all right
that ladies and gentlemen brings us to
the conclusion of the best live stream
you've ever seen in your life
um I got less pushback than I was
expecting I thought I'd get a lot more
pushback on this one
all right
narcissist
absolutely
oh you just reminded me
uh So I responded uh Dr Jordan Peterson
responded to one of my tweets
and he was saying talk about anonymity
on Twitter and he has some interesting
questions about the anonymous people
whether they're good or bad in general
but uh Peterson noted in his response to
me
that there's research that shows that
these Anonymous social media users
are high in the dark Triad narcissist
personality traits
so you've really created a an attractor
for the worst people in society
and it attracted to them just like you
should have and then they're acting
exactly like you'd expect the worst
people to act now I responded to him I
don't I don't know if he responded to my
response I didn't say it and it won but
I responded to him because I thought it
was funny
that Jordan Peterson would be calling
anybody a narcissist
but I don't put him in that category
without myself
so in my response you know I noted that
the two of us were two of us were both
peacocks so it's hard to say that the
anonymous people are narcissists when
the people in the conversation are Dr
Jordan Peterson and me
do you think Dr Jordan Peterson and and
me
do you think the two of us have the
right to call somebody else a narcissist
of all the two people in the world there
couldn't be two more narcissistic people
than us
like we're the two peacocks peacockiest
peacocks you've ever seen I mean we're
all about public attention
for presumably doing good work at least
that's the attempt now
I I'm quick to point out and I'm sure Dr
Peterson would point out the same that
they're basically two major kinds of
narcissists
and they're very different
one kind likes to show off
but the best way to show off is to
actually do something good
like that's how I play it like I don't
really it wouldn't feed me to get credit
for something I didn't do because
actually that happens fairly often
fairly often people will say oh you
you've made this prediction correctly
and I'll look at it and go no I didn't I
never made that prediction but thank you
for giving me credit but it doesn't do
anything for me
get getting credit for something I
didn't do happens to me all the time
it's like a very irregular occurrence
but what is something I didn't do it
gives me nothing
like there's no dopamine hit just
nothing it's like Ah that's weird but if
I get credit for something I actually
did that helped a real person
feels really good
so yeah I'm I'm the most narcissistic
grandiose narcissist you could ever be
but I think you know my non-medically
trained brain says that Peterson is
exactly like me in this one regard you
know unlike the poor man's version but
in this one regard he clearly
according to my personal impression I
can't read his mind but it appears that
he likes attention for doing things that
are useful and good for people
and why wouldn't he
wouldn't you
he just he can deliver so he's in that
position because he has the ability to
do it but if you had the ability to do
it
wouldn't you
wouldn't you
if you could do as much good as he does
wouldn't you do it and wouldn't you do
it as publicly as possible and wouldn't
you enjoy it if somebody said hey you
did something good for me of course you
would
and my understanding is that makes us
both narcissists
but
um that's a different kind than the dark
Triad narcissist so the other kind
is almost all bad
now it's all bad not almost it's just
all bad
so you got to keep your narcissist
straight and so I think my comment was a
little unfair because I was conflating
the two kinds of narcissists but it was
still struck me as funny
who is more powerful Kerry lake or
Mike's certified
is that a fair question it was more
powerful
well you mean this is more persuasive
right
who has better persuasion abilities
I think they're both tens
I don't know the probably both tens
10 out of 10.
all right
um
were you bullied as a child
me
who who wasn't bullied as a child
is there anybody who wasn't bullied as a
child
is that even a thing
you oh yeah somebody who's really big if
you're if you're very large and you're
male
maybe you weren't bullied that's true
but even then the older kids would bully
you know
you're not
I had a few beliefs but things didn't
work out for them
yeah so my my bullying narrative is that
I had a few but I uh I solved them both
with violence
yeah violence solves a lot of problems
violence is very successful yeah in in
the old days remember the the uh the old
way that you were taught to deal with
bullies is to attack them
so I just physically attacked them and
hurt them and then they never bothered
me again
but the the key to attacking a bully is
you got to make sure that the next time
they know you're going to kill them
you have to you have to you can't just
hurt them because then they might just
want to hurt you back
so you have to hurt them and tell them
that's that's just the appetizer
well there's the appetizer if you want
the full meal I'll come back
so if you don't do that part it doesn't
work so you gotta you gotta really sell
that part hard so once you have them
down and you're shoving grass in their
mouth
that's when you tell them you'll come
back
as I was making one of my bullies eat
grass in front of the rest of the class
as I was sitting on his chest shoving it
down his throat I uh
I I reminded him that I would come back
no Elon mentions I did mention him I
mentioned him in the reference to yo

something we think he knew it was a lie

just one story just change the variables

all right
uh
everyone cleped I bet when you beat your
bullies no I don't think they really
cared
they were doing their own thing it just
happened to be a busy place it wasn't
that they all crowded around it just was
in front of enough people that there
