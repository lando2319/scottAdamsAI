[Music]
hey
everybody come on in here
it's time for coffee with scott adams
that's me and this will be yeah
one of the highlights of your day maybe
the best part of your day
probably the best part of your day all
right it's the best part of your day
come on you know it is and to get it
going we'll do the simultaneous sip and
all it takes is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chalice or stein the canteen jugger
flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip and it
happens now
go
i feel my vitamin d increasing
along with my iq and my sex appeal
you could probably feel the same thing
at home speaking of being a new person
i've talked about this before but i i
just i'm blown away by it
it's sort of a personal thing but
it has a larger meaning so i'm
preparing for some sinus surgery and
part of that is i'm on prednisone for
the
third or fourth time this year to try to
clear up the
the sinuses and it works
in fact my uh my ability to smell just
came back like two minutes ago
so every time i go through one of these
cycles i can i can smell again for the
first time in years
but it doesn't last however here's the
the finding
the prednisone gives me
probably takes 25 years off of my
effective age
meaning that uh with just this little
bit of prednisone which is being used
for completely different purposes
my body doesn't get tired i
am full of energy and love of life
i can speak better i can exercise longer
i'm probably
25 stronger i mean it's not even close
i i could go to the gym and actually
watch muscle development in 48 hours
it's crazy it's crazy now so far i
haven't had any
anger issues from the bread the zone
maybe that'll come later
but now you can't do the prednisone for
long periods because it has some
negative side effects but the fact that
it can change me by 25 years
and it and it activates in just a day it
makes me wonder how close we are to
something that doesn't have side effects
is there is there any way to get there
or is it just there's an impossibility
that if it's going to make you feel good
it's going to kill you somehow
is that always the case because yeah
it's it's a
steroid somebody's saying and it's not
healthy
to do it in the long run but i only do
it for short bits
and yeah riding faster on my bike
i can walk for hours and no soreness no
stiffness
it's just like being you know a kid
again it's amazing but anyway just the
fact that that's even possible
really makes you wonder you know what
could happen
with with senior citizens
i mean you could give an 80 year old
this drug and
they could pretty much you know live
like a 60 year old i think
yeah if they if they had their mental
faculties
all right let's talk about some other
things that are not me uh post well okay
a little bit more about me
a pollster called me last night and i
couldn't remember
if i've ever been called by a political
pollster
so at least now we know that they call
now they call them my cell phone
it's the only one i have and
their first question was you know they
introduced themselves
but their first question was am i
registered to vote
now i wasn't thinking clearly because i
should have said yes i'm registered to
vote
so that then i could lie on the poll
itself but they rejected me
for not being a registered voter
now was there any chance that
if i had been a registered voter is
there any chance i would have told them
the truth
none not only is there no chance i would
have told them the truth
i didn't even consider it it wasn't even
my option set there was no point at
which i said to myself
uh should i say maybe i like trump a
little bit better as president
nope not not even a little bit was i
tempted to tell the truth
i wasn't tempted to tell the truth
that's how far away it is because
normally you know i i've got a
a pretty strong you know bias toward
telling the truth unless i'm going to
die or something
you know unless you're literally
protecting somebody's life or income or
there's something
big on the line i don't like lying at
all
i mean i hate it it's it's something i
try to avoid as much as possible it
never works out
you know even if you try to lie it never
works it just that's my experience
so i wouldn't lie in
almost any situation but i definitely
would have lied to the pollster because
that's a
security safety kind of a thing and
certainly that would be morally
acceptable in my view
um there was article uh joel pollock in
breitbart today
talking about joe biden who
will not disavow the protesters who are
also the violent ones
and this puts them in the category of
saying that the
all the people at the at the riots are
fine people
which is turn turn about is fair play
now
what is the difference or is there
between the people who said to president
trump when he said there were some fine
people in charlottesville at the
confederate statue
and and the neo-nazi march
and the president said well you know i'm
paraphrasing but
they're not all neo-nazis some of them
were just there
because of the statues and they're fine
people but what's the difference between
that
at which point somebody's not somebody
lots of people said
well you can't be a fine person if
you're at the same event with the
neo-nazis
it just can't happen well of course it
can happen because we're a big diverse
country
where any big gathering has lots of
different people so of course they could
be there
of course it would be weird to not have
counter protesters in america
you pretty much always expect that so
but the point is how can the
democrats how can joe biden say that
it's okay to march with the people who
are literally rioting
literally antifa literally want to burn
down the courthouse
literally want to get rid of police hurt
the police
literally want to overthrow the country
are literally bad so but those people
who are marching with them
and obviously giving them a boost
they're they're not they're not doing
something wrong feels like
at this point the people who just wanted
to get the message out
are kind of done aren't they is it raise
your hand has anybody not
heard black lives matter
has anybody not heard that is there
anybody who needs to get their mind
changed more on that topic
probably not we're probably as persuaded
as we're going to be
and there really isn't much of anybody
on the other side there's nobody arguing
for
black lives not mattering nobody's
arguing that
and nobody's even saying we won't look
at a proposal
nobody's even saying we're closed off to
how to improve nothing
so what is the purpose of the further
protests
if the message is completely received
and i'd say it is it's completely
received
why are they protesting well you have to
ask yourself if it's more about the bad
element
being the driving force and it's
starting to look like that
now the interesting thing about this and
of course
in our world everything comes back to
trump one way or another
is that every day these protests go on
i'm pretty sure is good day for trump
now it might not feel like that yet but
it's one of those things that the longer
it goes
the different it looks when a when a
protest or a riot
first starts you say to yourself well
it's unfortunate about that
the rioting and the looting but there
was certainly a good reason for the
protest
so you can kind of excuse it in the
early days
but once we've heard all the message and
there's not much pushback about the
general idea of let's not have the
police kill people that don't need to be
killed you know that sort of thing
you know racism could it be better could
we improve the schools
opened all that but
i i think trump is just going to get
stronger every day these go on
because the original message will dim in
importance and all you're going to see
is it just looks like trouble
now the interesting part is that so far
trump is only using his federal forces
the department of homeland security
i think in just one place defending a
federal building
in portland they're on call for seattle
and other places too i think but they're
just on call
and their job is to protect federal
assets apparently
this is being turned into by people like
the lincoln project and
rick wilson who's he's got some real
explaining to do
i think rick wilson has some explaining
to do in his life but that's just that's
his problem
you may know know of some of his
troubles um
but they're trying to turn it into that
these are secret police
with secret badges and it's a trump
secret police
and i'm trying to figure out where that
will rank
on the list of trump hoaxes you know
that
the top one would be russia collusion
then i'd say
the other 10th poll would be the fine
people hoax
there's the he suggested ingesting
actual household disinfectant hoax
the hoax list is pretty long at this
point but i wonder where the secret
police hoax will be
i think it'll be in the top four
possibly a top four
and now the media is trying to turn it
into the trump is causing the riots
by allowing the department of homeland
security to protect a federal building
and that's causing a riot
because they look like secret police
yeah
they're not but they look that way
um have you noticed a lot of women
getting their asses kicked in these
riots
and on video every day i go to twitter
it's the first thing i do is i look at
all the
you know the new andy no videos etc
and it feels like have women become a
lot more aggressive recently
is anybody noticing this and i can't
tell
if what's happening is that women feel
they won't be killed because that's
generally true right if a woman gets in
a fight
she doesn't usually get killed but if a
man gets in the fight
there's a pretty good chance one of them
one of you is going to end up dead
so i feel like women are just getting
well somebody said the chubby ones in
the comments i wasn't going to say that
but you can't not notice it
it's impossible not to notice that the
women who are getting the fights
they tend to be larger and maybe that's
part of
why they're braver they just have more
mass to put against it
that's not a universal truth we just
watched a
skinny white woman get roughed up by the
police on video yesterday
but she was yelling in their faces and
provoking them
so they finally just took her down but i
haven't seen anything like this this is
the angriest
most violent group of women i've ever
seen
anywhere i don't think i've even seen
another country
with so many women getting into violent
fights every day at least on video so
it may be overstated because the video
makes you think it's everywhere but it
isn't
all right uh what else we got going on
this is the biggest story that gets
no attention and it's mind-blowing to
watch the biggest
stories be ignored while the smallest
stories become the story
the smallest story is that the police
sometimes kill somebody
or somebody dies in their you know
during the arrest phase
but it's so small i mean it's in terms
of number of people
affected even if you count the families
of the people who died
it's still a small number compared to
just about every other problem
so we we're we're sort of an upside down
world
where we're making the biggest story out
of the smallest story
but here's the biggest story
apparently the united states policy
against
about china has changed to regime change
what so mike pompeo apparently
says it directly that regime change
is is now the new uh policy
so we went from trying to work a deal
with china
to finding out that we can't that they
their mindset
is such that they only want an abusive
deal
or apparently no deal at all so it looks
like no deal at all is where it's going
to head
but pompeo was just going at it directly
and saying no
we're our goal is a regime change in
china
now can the united states get that done
now
i don't believe that that means you know
supporting a revolution or anything i
can't see that working in china
but it probably does mean not not
dealing with china as a country
it probably does mean moving our
facilities out it probably does mean
putting up more obstacles than we ever
were it probably does mean
putting more naval assets in the
contested
areas etc so this is a
really big story it's by far the most
important thing that's happening
i would say more important than climate
change more more important than
everything
more important than coronavirus more
important you know the economy i guess
you could say is the most important
thing
but it's way up there and you won't see
much about that today i'll bet
there'll be an ignored story speaking of
ignored stories
jonathan turley you know of him
a constitutional lawyer type
and he's writing in the hill how he's
astonished that the media
is just ignoring the fact
that the obama administration did make
up
an excuse to spy on the trump campaign
and
we're trying to figure out why this
isn't the biggest story in the country
is it just because it's about trump and
that it would be good for trump
because it would vindicate him for when
he said that his wires were being tapped
which you know not technically true in
the terms of tapping
but but true enough i mean basically
he correctly called out that his
campaign was being spied on
and that was just true now i tried to
figure out why
this story isn't getting the traction it
should
it got a lot of traction on you know the
fox news and the right but it just
didn't cross over it just never became
a narrative on the other the mainstream
media
and i have a few theories why the
obvious one is that
the media can't admit that they sold us
a hoax for
three years or whatever it was so the
media
doesn't want to point out their own
wrongness they don't want to support
trump so that might be the entire reason
but the other reason is this
it's kind of complicated and
even though even when i think i
understand it even just reading jonathan
turley's article i'll find four things i
didn't know
or i used to know and i forgot so it's
just this big
complicated thing of why did somebody
talk to somebody
what did carter page you know what did
they
have to do with was he a cia agent
did he work with him what did russia do
where was the dossier
just way too many people involved way
too many people so i think
because it's complicated and because it
dripped out
you know a little fact little fact
little fact
it just never got traction so part of it
is that it dribbled out
so it lost all of its energy by
dribbling the others as complicated so
we wouldn't understand it if if we saw
the details
and then of course they just don't want
to make trump look good
on predict it and other betting
platforms kamala harris just
got a big upswing no explanation is
given
but she's now had 39 chance of winning
at least according to the people betting
if you're going to look at predictive
markets
doesn't the stock market tell you that
trump is going to win
it feels like it right unless there's
going to be some giant plot
to tank the stock market right before
the election which is possible
so do not be surprised if the stock
market
takes a serious dump between now and
november
but it might be politically motivated so
could be real maybe you know maybe the
economic outlook won't look that good
and it'll just be a natural decline
which wouldn't be wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world and it
wouldn't be unexpected actually
but at the moment the stock market
captures
the economy obviously it captures our
optimism on it but i also think that the
stock market at the moment
is capturing coronavirus so if you look
at the biggest things that the president
has to do is stuff like you know trade
deals with china and coronavirus and the
economy
and the stock market kind of captures
all of that because they're all
interconnected
and it's high it went down a little bit
last few days but it basically is high
so isn't that predicting that trump will
win
um just a question there
so i keep seeing this graph
by a user named gummy bear now gummy
bear
was recommended to me as being a good
credible source
on the corona iris stuff now gummy bear
is obviously a
pseudo name for someone who apparently
has some kind of credentials
i don't know what kind but they're the
good kind
because the twitter feed has lots of
credible looking good analysis according
to people who
have been following him so i started
following
gummy bear and there's one
graph that gummy bear has posted a
number of times
and it's really persuasive super
persuasive
if if you're a nerd like i am about a
data visualization
it's just really good it's like
thrillingly
well designed just to give you
information
but i don't know if it's accurate so i
don't know if the data is right
i just know that the way it's presented
was great and what it was is
it just ranked all the countries their
death rate
by how they used a hydroxychloroquine
if they had used it early according to
the graph
which has some credibility questions
that's what i'm going to get to
it would show that the people who didn't
the countries that didn't use
hydroxychloroquine early
have all these problems the ones that
did use it you know in a modest way
have half as many problems and those who
used it aggressively
have practically no problems and so i
put it out there and i had to tweet and
say
can somebody tell me if this is accurate
because if it is accurate we're done
right we're done
somebody says it's fake why are you
arguing
um so i put it out there to let other
people
pick it apart and sure enough some
people said well you know i'm looking at
the graph
but i'm looking at this country and it's
in the wrong place
or it doesn't capture it right somebody
says i doubt such data is available
i also didn't see a date on it so it
might have been
you know over a month ago when things
look different so
somebody says why not research it
yourself let me answer that question so
somebody said why not research it
myself that's the dumbest question in
the world
and i i have to be blunt everybody who
thinks that they are capable of
researching this
themselves you're just kidding yourself
even the experts can't do it
if the experts could research this stuff
they would all agree
right if what you could do is use your
expertise
and dig into it a little bit the people
with expertise would be on the same side
but you don't notice you don't see
anything like that happening what you
see is the experts digging in
and coming to completely different
conclusions so if you think you can do
what the experts clearly can't do
because they're not coming to the same
conclusions
why do you think i can do it why would
you suggest
that i would be able to do this thing
that literally no one in the world can
do
it's just undoable now you could think
you did it
and you can do your research and you can
come to a conclusion
but you would be talking yourself into
it you would be talking yourself into
stupidity basically
because confirmation bias is going to
look just like it
i mentioned the the michael jackson
allegations about you know pedophilia
and now i've seen three different pieces
of video content
one made a case that said oh definitely
he's guilty
no doubt about it i watch another and
you look at it you go oh
wow it's all like it's all a con none of
it was true
i watched another one yesterday that
added more fuel to the
none of it was true fire
so i did my research right
i looked into the whole michael jackson
situation and what happened
i couldn't tell a thing i mean if i if i
had to be in a jury
based on what i saw i would say
definitely not guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt
i mean it's way beyond reasonable doubt
you know reasonable doubt is just this
thin sliver of well maybe
maybe he's not guilty the michael
jackson thing is mostly reasonable now
it's like
95 reasonable doubt five percent chance
maybe something happened and there just
didn't have to
happen to be any evidence so
i use that as an example of how doing
your own research doesn't do you a bit
of good
it really doesn't it's it's a complete
um it's complete illusion
and that probably has to do some with
our
with our belief that we can do more than
we can do
somebody says interview dr zelenko
terrible idea
terrible idea whoever is saying
in the comments and i don't mean to pick
on you as
but you could not be
less helpful than to suggest that i
interview
one expert i've said this before but it
sounds like i have to say it again
it is a disservice to the audience
for someone who can't ask the right
questions to interview an expert
because all you're going to hear is his
his side of it you're going to hear one
side of the
you know the michael jackson story it's
always convincing if you hear one side
it's the same reason i won't talk to dr
shiva on this topic
because dr shiva will say technical
things and then i'll say
i don't know and then you will have been
you will have gotten this unfiltered
opinion that you know there's another
opinion on the other side but you didn't
hear it
right now somebody says i'm in the
comments that dr
drew did a periscope with zelenko
now that's how you do it if i
actually i like to look for that if if a
doctor
is interviewing a doctor and the doctor
doing the interviewing has a broad
experience enough to ask the right
questions
that's exactly what you should read but
don't ask me to bring one expert on
on a medical or scientific thing unless
i have some background
so i don't mind bringing somebody on and
say a nuclear energy question
because i've done enough reading where i
can at least ask the right questions
thanks to mark schneider and michael
sheldenberger who have
educated me a little bit enough to ask
the right questions
all right so and and i'm sorry if i make
a big deal about that
the bringing the one expert on but
that's the biggest problem in the world
right now
the biggest problem in the world is that
people still believe
that if they hear one expert that they
learn
something and that is so not true if you
had one if you've only heard one expert
you have probably been misled
probably not every time
boris johnson is doing something awesome
you know one of the problems with being
a leader
is that the most important things you
can do will sometimes be the most
boring and they don't get you any
attention and they don't get you
reelected
so i'm gonna give a big big big shout
out
and props thumbs up to boris johnson
for just this i'm i don't have a comment
on boris johnson's entire political
career
but just this he's going to make a big
big deal about weight loss
using himself as an example so you know
he had his coronavirus
scare and it's worse for people who have
weight problems apparently
and i think that might have been a
wake-up call he'd wanted to lose weight
anyway but now he's getting serious
about it and he's going to go
he goes for a run every day changing his
diet
and i can't think of anything that would
be
more directly beneficial to the country
than having the leader promote
good fitness and exercise it's really
important
and i guess in great bread and the
obesity level is just out of control
and the way boris johnson is selling it
is exactly right
it's he's selling it as a way to protect
uk's national health system
boom there you are if if you said to
people you should lose weight for your
own benefit
well people say i'll figure out what my
benefit is
you know i don't need boris johnson
telling me
what to do with my personal life you
just run the government boris
i'll decide if i eat a cheesesteak
but the way so he's not doing it that
way so he's not saying this will be good
for you if you lose weight he's saying
this is how you lower costs basically
this is how you make
a national health service
possible i would say that president
trump is
missing the biggest opportunity with
health care
because there is a republican plan
it just hasn't been put together so i
guess you could say it's not a plan
but if you looked at all the individual
things that
the trump administration wants to do for
health care you know such as the
executive orders on pharmaceutical costs
lowering meds costs etc there's a whole
bunch of individual things
that will make things more competitive
could bring the prices down
such as making it possible to do
telehealth uh over the internet
across state lines you know these little
changes in the regulatory environment
can have a big impact
but one of the things that trump could
do which
i guess it would be hard for him to do
because he's got a few pounds himself
is to do what boris johnson's doing and
just say
if you want if you want more people to
have health care
then the people who already have health
care maybe they should lose some weight
because if the people who already had
health care
well plus the people who don't you could
say the whole public
if the whole public of the united states
simply became
more fit they just lost weight got a
little more exercise
what would that do to the total cost of
health care service
well if you've had an opportunity to go
to
a doctor's waiting room or emergency
room
is there something that you notice not
so much an emergency room because those
would be accidents
but let's say you go to a normal
doctor's waiting room back when
you could be in a room with other people
and you sit down and look at the other
people in the room
how many of them have a weight problem
a lot a lot what would be the total cost
reduction in health care if people got
healthier
it could be a lot 10 you know a 10
percent
reduction in health care just by getting
people healthier
that's enormous dollar wise
so but i'm not sure trump is quite the
right guy
for that message unless he was going to
you know lead by doing it
the way boris johnson is so i'm sorry
weight loss is the most boring political
question but that's my point
it's the most important and it's the
most directly beneficial to people's
lives
a plus boris johnson all right
it seems like we're going to be treated
to a constant drip of stories about
sports teams and whether or not they all
kneeled
is there anything you're less interested
in lately do you remember when that was
first a story
oh these athletes some of them are
kneeling kaepernick
he's disrespecting our flag and all that
but now when they're all kneeling
or some or close to all and it's all the
teams
it just lost all of its everything
didn't it it doesn't have any shock
value
it just looks sort of weak and pathetic
and which has nothing to do by the way
with the cause so when i say it looks
weak and pathetic
that has nothing to do with the the
cause has only to do with
the way they're doing it um
there's a news story that doesn't
deserve to be a news story that
joe biden turned down fox news's chris
wallace for an interview
now as you know chris wallace did
interview president trump
and you know gave him a pretty tough
interview one would imagine that chris
wallace would be a tough interview with
joe biden
and so they turned it down but is the
news that
chris wallace was turned down for an
interview is that the news
isn't the news that just biden doesn't
talk to anybody
i don't think has anything to do with
chris wallace is there anybody on the
fox news
network who could get biden to come on
the air and answer questions
there's nobody who could do that has
nothing to do with chris wallace
but it turned into a chris wallace story
i know because it makes it look worse
for biden or something
but i don't know how it can look any
worse than i'm not going to have a
debate and i'm not going to answer
questions
i should tell you everything you need to
know there
oh i keep forgetting to talk about
president trump's
latest name for the coronavirus so he's
calling it the
china virus now you recall that when he
was calling it the chinese virus
people were saying a racist you racist
don't call it chinese because then
chinese americans will you know be
be mocked for it even though they have
nothing to do with it and
indeed that looks like that actually was
happening which is tragic
but now he's going from chinese virus to
china
virus and it's very clever
because you think there's something
wrong with it still
but there isn't when he said chinese
you could say to yourself wait a minute
chinese would refer to maybe it came
from china but it also
the word refers to the people and we're
not really talking about the people
we should be talking about the the
government or the place
and but when he changes it to china that
is
unambiguously about the place you could
you could argue it's also about the
government
but what it definitely isn't is about
the people so that's an upgrade but
what's
clever about the upgrade is because
china and chinese are close enough
in your mind it still feels
inappropriate
but it isn't because now it's just a
description of where it came from
just like other flues that are named
after the place that they came from
so i love the fact that he took
something that really wasn't the right
way to go about it
chinese it just wasn't the right word
but you fixed it you tweaked it
you tweaked it to china and now people
are going to be just as angry about it
but they don't have a reason because
china is a different word all right
the best thing that could happen for
trump's re-election
chances are for other countries
to have bad infections uh that pop back
up
and it feels guaranteed doesn't it
isn't it sort of guaranteed that other
countries are going to have flare-ups
even the ones that are doing well
i feel like it's guaranteed and it
should be guaranteed just because the
world still has
travel so no matter how good your little
country of estonia does
if you're surrounded by people that have
well let's say even one of those
countries
still have it well you're going to get
it back
and if you get it back isn't it going to
flare again before you can get on top of
it
so the probably the biggest factor
in trump's reelection will be
coronavirus and how people feel he did
with it
and that will be almost entirely based
on what other countries do
because if he looks like he's just in
the middle of the pack
and other countries are having problems
then
then you're going to have to say to
yourself it looks like leadership didn't
matter
it will actually look like leadership
didn't matter
because you'll see all these different
leaders who did different things
and none of them had a great result and
some that did you don't know why
here's what's confusing about all this
these are the candidates
for why some countries may or may not
have had better results
and look at how many factors there are
there's better mass
compliance now experts will argue
whether that even makes any difference
i'm on the side of saying it's obviously
it obviously does
uh social distancing that has a little
to do with lifestyle
but you know are some countries better
at it what's your vitamin d levels
um how much diabetes do you have in the
country which is
gets to age and demographics uh the
hydroxychloroquine use
does it matter don't know yet it's still
uncertain
tuberculosis shots that's another factor
apparently there's some correlation
if you've had tuberculosis shots you
have more
immunity i think and then there's some
news today about there's some
genetic variant that some people have
that might make them
far more susceptible so look at all
these things
that are like big big variables and we
don't know
how important any of them are listen to
these again
and realize that we don't know
anything about any of them and they're
the biggest variables
we don't know if the masks make a big
difference a little difference people
are still arguing
you know i have my opinion but people
are arguing social distancing
i don't know can you really tell that
another country did it better
how do you compare it's hard to compare
how much is enough how much is too much
vitamin d i don't know diabetes
looks like 40 or 50 percent of the
people i think 50
of the people under a certain age
are dying with diabetes as a comorbidity
comorbidity when we look at the
experience of other countries
are we seeing other countries with the
same rates of diabetes the same
demographics now same hydroqual
hydroxychloroquine use no
tuberculosis shots no genetic variants i
don't know
are they different than different groups
so
we will never know if trump did a good
job or a bad job
in all likelihood we'll probably never
know
so if we never know if he's doing a good
job or a bad job
because there's just too many variables
to know which ones matter
and then you've got the therapeutics and
you've got the
vaccines maybe you're maybe not coming
online
i would say that we'll we'll have enough
room for everybody to have their own
opinion
but the one thing that's the most
solid argument for trump if it happens
is that other countries got into trouble
and we're just somewhere in the middle
of the pack
if it turns out that we're just
somewhere in the middle
i think you just have to say leadership
didn't make a difference
because we don't know what to lead to
leadership makes a difference if you
know where you're going and it's the
right thing
and hindsight says yeah that was the
right thing
but if you don't know what the right
thing to do is
leadership almost doesn't matter you
just have to try things and
adjust and that's what everybody's doing
all right
that is about all i have to say for
today
somebody says it's not about the
leadership it's about the systems in
place and the ability to prioritize
maybe so um certainly the fact that we
have
you know states rights puts us in a
different category from some small
country
where they can just say hey everybody do
this whereas in the united states it's
50 different entities saying
do this or that um
all right just looking at uh
your comments all right
did i speak about china in houston yeah
i talked
not today but i have talked about the
consulate being closed
and there will be a lot more of that i
think
uh remember no straws after surgery
what
oh so just to warn you so my surgery is
on the uh
29th few days um
i probably might miss a periscope but
i'll tweet at you and let you know
oh yeah this is the nadler video so
nadler was
found on the park bench by i know uh
hogan hogan rogan handley
and they asked them about the
the violence and he thought that there
was no violence as just protests
now do you think he actually believes
that
and what are the chances that jerry
nadler is going to survive coronavirus
if jerry nadler got the coronavirus he's
kind of dead doesn't he
i mean i don't mean to be unkind but he
would be sort of the poster child of
people who are not going to make it
through
coronavirus so if i were him i don't
know how he i mean he's pretty brave to
come to work at all
i think he's coming to work and wearing
his mask on his forehead i saw a picture
that's pretty brave because he's
definitely in the
the death zone there the kill box so
we'll give that
thank you for the good wishes and i will
talk to you
hogan gidley thank you hogan gidley is
the name that i messed up
sorry hogan
