oh
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called
coffee with Scott Adams and there's
never been a finer experience
if you're starting to tingle that's why
and if you'd like to take that tingle up
to a full-blown throb all you need is a
cup of mug or a glass of tanker
chalice's diet a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
ah
well
I'd like to start with an announcement
given the
upcoming arraignment of of ex-president
Trump
and uh
because of his legal troubles I'm
changing my endorsement to Joe Biden
Joe Biden so 2024 Biden Joe Biden
Biden Biden Biden Biden
April Fools
April Fools
all right
I am trying today a new experiment
they should Garner us the most number of
viewers ever
I'm using the new newly disclosed rules
of Twitter's algorithm uh well the rules
of what tweets get boosted
to cleverly boost my tweet today using
the new rules that have just been
disclosed we'll talk about that in
detail but watch the number count if
I've correctly gamed the system
it'll be more people than we've ever had
before
because the Tweet will be more visible I
think
we'll talk about that later
well here's some big news the Tate
Brothers have been released from prison
but they're still in house arrest I
guess
and
here's what I have to say about now you
probably now
I'm not a fan of the Tate Brothers
mostly Andrew Tate I have a personal
beef with him
but his story is interesting
so I'm going to talk about it anyway
and what I realized was he has the most
interesting business model I tweeted
about this just think about Andrew
Tate's business model
according to his accusers
he taught women how to exploit men
online
while also teaching men how to avoid
being exploited by women online and in
general
while also teaching men that's easy to
make money
and he made money doing all three he
made money teaching women how to scam
men
have to avoid being scammed
and then men how to make money
easily
and he did all three of them
apparently he made money on all three
that is the tightest business model I've
ever seen I'm not saying you should
you know emulate him
I'm not saying he's a good person
I'm just saying that's a hell of a
business model
that's all that's all I have to say
about that but here's the interesting
part
if the teacher on house arrest will that
allow them to do public media
in other words will they will he go back
to live streaming as soon as he gets a
haircut
I don't know so here's what you want to
watch for with the Tates I don't know
what they've done
if anything so I'm not personally aware
of any crimes but they've been accused
of quite bad things
so while we don't know if those are real
charges or trumped-up charges or what
they are
here's the interesting part of the story
as I've told you before Andrew Tate is
very persuasive he has the actual tools
of persuasion and as soon as he got out
of jail
as soon as he can talk
it's going to change things
in other words we're going to get to see
how capable he is
because I suspect there's some real
legal risks here and if he can get out
of them
it will be quite a show
I have to admit it would be a hell of a
show if he somehow gets out of all of
his legal problems but I think there's a
chance
I think there's actually a chance you'll
actually get away with everything
or maybe you didn't do anything there's
that's technically illegal I don't know
he certainly is accused of things that
sound pretty heinous but uh I'm going to
be watching this
both from a legal perspective
but also just to see if his toolbox
is sufficient to get him out of this if
it is he's going to come back stronger
and that would be interesting
because I do believe he is at risk to
the system
would you agree with that
I think he's a risk to the whole system
because the things he's saying are you
know often provocative and you know you
can have your own opinions about the
ethics of it and all that but there is a
certain truth to it
that is very disturbing to people who
don't want you to know those truths
it's pretty interesting
here's my question
there's a lot of news about these drag
shows not only for children but for a
lot of public officials and stuff a lot
of drag shows
and it made me wonder how many forms of
live entertainment are there for school
children
because I was trying to think why is it
that if you asked me to list all of the
live entertainment options for school
children
I would only be able to think of one
well
you've got your trans activist dancing
that's one
what would be the second one
no I mean that doesn't involve children
you know because children put on their
own place but what would be the what's
the other one and why can't I name one
I'm wondering is it possible that
there's also live entertainment
that would feature a republican men
dancing with traditional wives
you know in traditional like 50s garb
probably there is right but I'm guessing
that they don't get much attention
because they don't dance as well
probably they're probably just bad
dancers so you don't hear about them now
one of the things that impressed me
about the trans entertainers
is that they seem to get
they have no problem getting booked for
gigs apparently because we keep seeing
video of them
but
other forms of dancing correct me if I'm
wrong I'm not I'm not really like
you know big on the the Arts
but most form of dancing don't you
follow sort of a a set pattern of
movement
is that wrong
because the the trends have a whole
different way of entertaining which
apparently is very successful and I've
been trying to learn
how they do it
and
it looks freestyle yeah it's freestyle
and I was wondering how hard it is
so I thought I'd give you a little dance
performance it's something I learned
from the trans Community I'm not
pretending to be trans that would be
what would that be that would be called
uh cultural something so I'm not doing
that I'm just trying to learn from them
and pick up the tricks because I was
watching one of the trans dancers
and it doesn't seem like there's too
much to it I think I could probably
a little stretching first
all right
all right so I'm not pretending to be
trans not pretending to be trans I'm
only learning from their technique
[Music]
thank you
oh
I think that was pretty good
if you're listening to this
oh damn
it
ah
sorry locals I didn't notice my laptop
fell over
you're gonna have to
you're gonna have to watch it on YouTube
or in replay on YouTube
now
I can kind of see how the kids like it
doesn't have rules
things like that
all right uh
so I wonder what kind of live
entertainment would also be allowed do
you think if the military
had a dance troop
that the military Dance troupe would be
invited
How about if police
had some kind of acapella group
do you think the school children would
invite them to perform
I don't know
or or is it really the trans community
are the only ones providing any live
entertainment
I don't know
anyway so AI has been banned in Italy
Italy band AI
specifically chat GPT you open IAI
whatever it is and their problem was
data security
but I think it's the beginning
I I think I'm the only one predicting
this
two predictions about AI
number one it will never be smart
it will be an idiot savant
and what I mean by that is that it will
do some things extraordinarily well like
play chess write code do math
it's going to do some Savant stuff like
really really well
but it will never be smart in a
conversational way
because it can't be smarter than people
that I don't see any scenario in which
you can study people
learn from people and then become a
super intelligence
have you ever wondered about how that
works
yeah I know you disagree and and most
people would so so I'm basically
I'm basically saying something that I
assume most people disagree
my statement is that except for those
few like STEM related
very rule-based things like you know
chess is rules-based programming is
rules based math is rules based so once
you get outside of the rules-based
scenario
the only way that we train AI
is on humans
if a human would say this then the AI
will say it
and there's no way you can train
something to be super smart
by giving it infinite examples of idiocy
there's no there's no amount of stupid
you could put into it to make it smart
and that is actually the plan
the plan is if you add enough stupidity
into a database the net effect will be
super intelligence
am I making that up
that's real right
am I am I just completely ignorant about
why AI is or am I saying something
that's so obvious
that how else could it go
so AI can't be more than a bigoted
biased
stupid
personality
but it will have some skills
its personality would just be freaking
idiot because it's going to be based on
people now if it's not an idiot
how could it not be an idiot well
one way would be if these smart people
who developed it
gave it limitations
and said all right you're not going to
be allowed to say anything that Q Anon
says
or anything that antifa says
but black lives matter is fine
and we love trans community and
basically you just get one person's or
some small group of people's opinion of
what is good and what is bad
so that your best case scenarios that AI
is like the few people who created it
because they limit what it can and
cannot do
or it's just stupid
because it's some average of stupid
people
so it's either going to be illegal or
stupid
but really good at math and a few few
technical things that
are useful
you think AI is running the show
I don't
I don't
yeah I've lost all Faith at AI
isn't that weird
it's supposed to be going in the other
directions where I'm supposed to be
wowed by its capabilities I'm absolutely
convinced it's useless
except for
rules-based things where it could be
very smart
yeah now it might be like an interesting
companion just because it's stupid
you know you think oh that's just like a
person
but I don't think we're going to put up
with stupidity in the machines
we barely put up with stupidity in other
humans
it's going to be real hard to take if
your machine starts acting dumb in front
of you it's like ah I'm paying for you I
don't want to pay for you to say dumb
stuff right in front of me
you know you if you're a republican
maybe you don't get along with Democrats
but do you want to sit in the same room
for a long period of time
talking about politics probably not no
so you're either going to make your your
version of AI let's say your personal
one you're using you're either going to
make it follow your personality
which seems likely
you're not going to make it opposite of
your opinions
or you wouldn't pay for it or you
wouldn't talk to it
I know I've got a feeling that
everything we predict about AI is wrong
which by the way is the universal
smartest uh opinion on anything new
it's kind of cheating
you can take anything that's brand new
and complicated and you could just say
I've got a prediction that in 10 years
I'll review about this new and
complicated thing will be very different
than it is right now and you would be
right
every time right so if you just took
everything we think about AI at the
moment it's probably all wrong
it's probably all wrong we just don't
know what is right
yeah
but we should treat it like we do know
what's that has a risk so I don't know
if Italy will be the first to ban it but
now there's a chat GPT had some fairly
minor data security problem and that'll
scare people
uh Elon Musk oh here this is interesting
apparently Elon Musk
has already started recruiting uh AI
programmers
you see where that's going
so musk was part of the original what he
thought was going to be a publicly
available non-profit AI thing open AI
but he left because it turned commercial
and that was the opposite of what he
wanted
he wanted an AI that would just compete
with Google
and be available to everybody sort of or
open source when it became sort of some
would say captured by Microsoft because
they put an enormous investment into it
now they don't have a board member
and they have less than half of the
shares but
I don't see how they could not influence
it with that much money so obviously
Microsoft has some influence over it
Etc I think musk is going to compete
with it and I think musk is going to
build the non-woke version because he's
complained specifically about AI being
woke and what he said was if AI is woke
it will be a liar
now this is direct as you could possibly
be if you make AI woke like humans it
will be a liar
like humans
and what would be the point of building
a liar who would do that that's what
we're doing
we're actually building a liar we're
building the smartest liar that's ever
existed
and right in front of us because it it
is limited in what it can say it cannot
do a poem that is positive for Trump but
it can do a poem that's positive for
Biden
that's all you need to know
yeah one is inappropriate and the other
oh yeah sure I can do a
poem a praising Biden no problems
no problem
all right
so that'll be interesting I think the
you know it's a enormously expensive but
he can afford it if he wants so if musk
builds his own competing AI now I think
he already has AI right it's already in
his the Tesla but it's a it's a a
different version it's more for
recognizing a landscape and navigating
it's not so much the language-based one
so maybe he's adding the language-based
stuff who knows
all right let's talk about the Trump
charges allegedly Trump will be
arraigned on Tuesday
um
so there are 30 some charges
what do you think are the odds that
there are charges we haven't heard about
what are the odds
do you think because the only thing we
know were leaks that are not really uh
not really dependable so do you think
the leaks are nailed it then it's just
some kind of
you know creative
creative prosecution that turns
something into a felony that wouldn't
otherwise be a felony and you know
somehow we extended the statute of
limitations and it's all sketchy or do
you think that they also
maybe in addition to that or instead of
do you think they have something real
something they could stand up in court
and people would say oh okay that's
that's real
I
it could go either way
I think it could go either way but if I
had to bet on it just for fun I would
bet it's not real
I would bet that uh Jonathan Turley has
exactly the right take which is there's
no question that it's a political
prosecution
meaning that the charges would be the
kind you wouldn't bring on on other
people it's just sort of a trump
specific prosecution
that's that's my best guess my best
guess is that it is perfectly political
and the charges will be weak exactly
like you think
but but just be aware we could be
totally wrong
because if you come back to me on
Wednesday and say Scott
he had all these surprise charges and
you said he wouldn't I'm not I wouldn't
be surprised by that
I think it's like a 60 40. sixty percent
chance is just what you think it is weak
charges
and a 40 chance they surprise us
but that's a pretty big difference 16
40.
all right
uh
so far the only effect on Trump is he's
raised a lot more money for the campaign
and the polls have improved for him
substantially like really substantially
do you think that is a lasting effect
or do you think
or is it just a temporary balance
lasting effect or temporary bounce well
some of it depends if he still if he's
still battling it
during the elections
you know what would be the best Trump
campaign I could ever think of
he goes to court every day
on trumped up charges
just that
just seeing him in court every day and
having the you know the right leading
commentators say well it's a political
prosecution
this is how Biden is running for
president by using the Machinery of
government indirectly because he doesn't
directly you know Biden doesn't control
the the D.A but
collectively they seem to be acting as
one
which is not a coincidence
and
Trump could win by just being in court
when he should be
you know when he should be uh out
campaigning because the thing about
Trump is he's releasing all his policy
stuff on videos which I think is strong
that's a very good technique
and you know exactly where he stands on
pretty much everything
he doesn't need to campaign that much he
just needs to be visible it would be an
interesting way to make it visible as a
target of political
Hillary
so that could happen all right Wall
Street General did a poll and here's how
they framed it which I think is the
wrong frame listen to this sentence 66
percent of Democrats think indictment is
motivated
uh
is motivated by the law all right and so
in other words two-thirds of democrat
Democrats think that the Trump
indictment is not political
not political there's just nobody's
above the law
do you think that's the way to to report
that news that two-thirds of Democrats
think everything's going right
everything's fine
here's the other way to say the same
thing
breaking one of the longest patterns
that we've ever seen
one-third of Democrats actually agree
with Republicans that this is totally
political
where have you ever seen one-third of
Democrats agree with Republicans
I mean I I I'm sure it happens but it's
pretty rare right shouldn't the headline
be an unprecedented number of Democrats
understand that this is a political
thing and let me ask you a second
question
do you think that the Democrats who said
oh no this is totally about the law it's
only about the law there's nothing
political about this how many of them
believed what they said
maybe none maybe zero
yeah so I think I think the real story
here is that even Democrats even
Democrats can clearly see this is a
political indictment
shouldn't that be the story
if one third of Democrats are on the
same side as Republicans
the story is the ones who are on the
same side not the ones who disagree it's
like a backwards report
do you see it too or am I just babbling
is that point clear
that's reported backwards yeah
and that's the Wall Street Journal who
you wouldn't expect to be you know super
Lefty
all right um 93 of Republicans and 70
percent of independent voters
think it's motivated by politics
70 percent of independent voters
what percent of independent voters
normally go left versus normally go
right because they're pretty Dependable
usually
is it close to half
I don't know what it is
but that I I can't believe that 70
percent are typically on Trump's side
that's not common right it's not normal
that 70 percent of Independents would be
pro-trump
I don't think so
so there's that are left right they lean
just slightly left is that about right
60 40 Democrat somebody says
that sounds right I don't know if that's
right
but to me these are gigantic numbers
suggesting that Trump should win the
presidency fairly easily
but it's impossible to predict at this
point all right here's my take on
whether the
this situation will matter to the final
election
no no won't matter
won't make any difference
here's why
if you wanted to want Trump you had lots
of reasons you didn't need any new
reasons if you wanted to dislike Trump
you had lots of reasons you didn't need
a new reason
nobody needed a new reason for anything
there's no new reasons
all of our old reasons are just as good
as they need to be
now the other but the one thing that
could change is motivation to actually
vote
that could change
because I I have to say
I felt more likely to vote because it
made me angry
and anger is not really your best reason
for voting but yeah I'm glad we have the
option
so I've got a feeling that there will be
25 outrages far bigger than this between
now and election day
you you won't even remember this it just
it'll just be completely cleared out of
your memory banks there'll be 10 new uh
fake news stories about Trump
and Trump will do 10 outrageous things
that you can't imagine he said
and then there'll be 10 emergencies in
the world that you didn't see coming
it's just going to be nothing but twists
and turns so no I don't think it'll have
any difference the only difference will
be that Trump got a fundraising boost
yeah you got a fundraising boost and uh
it may freeze the Santa Sabbath the
primaries
if it has any effect it'll be a
short-term effect but in the short term
it can certainly make DeSantis pause
his campaign plans don't you think
if you were DeSantis wouldn't you wait
to see how this plays out
because if he gets convicted you might
say all right I better get in
if he doesn't get convicted and it just
raises his popularity with his base
you better stay out
so I think I think DeSantis is planning
to run but also wait and see meaning he
won't execute depending on how things go
that's what I see
even Mike Pence who is not the best
friend of trump at this point because of
January 6
Etc
and uh Pence is even thinking about
running against Trump
right so he's not the one who's going to
defend Trump but may I say again
that although I don't want Mike Pence to
be my president
my God he impresses me
once again Mike Pence did the stand up
correct thing for the country
and it wasn't in his best interest
wasn't in his best interest maybe it was
I mean because I you know I respect him
for it maybe it was but I don't think
he's going to get elected or anything
because of it
so Mike Pence once again you have proven
a model of
human behavior I won't even say
republican I'll say he's a model of good
human behavior I really appreciate that
from him I don't want him to be my
president but as a human he does set a
good example
because he defended Trump uh he said it
was just political charges
well this is super interesting to nerds
like me who use Twitter so musk has
released
the algorithms the the actual code
the programming code for when your
tweets get a lot of attention and when
they're suppressed
now this doesn't get to Shadow Banning
but it tells you what kind of tweets
Twitter likes and what they don't and
there were some surprises
there were some surprises would you like
to know what makes a tweet uh get more
attention of course you would
so courtesy of a Twitter user nft God so
it's nft underscore God who I'm guessing
is a programmer went through the code
and showed us screenshots and this is
what he reports now I suppose it's a
little early so maybe other people might
have a different view of some of these
things but it looked reliable in general
so here's what he found if you uh
it counts likes on Twitter more than
retweets
okay totally surprised but when you
think about it and that makes sense
the more people hit the like button the
more likely people like it
so Twitter wants you to see stuff you
like
so if people like it
there you go now my behavior for a lot
of tweets had been I would retweet it
thinking well that's what's best for the
person who posted it
I wouldn't necessarily hit like
because often I would be thinking well
it's not that I'm agreeing exactly with
the Tweet but I think you should see it
so I'd retweet as what I thought was a
respectful way to treat the Tweeter if I
didn't exactly agree with it but I
thought it was useful part of the
conversation now I would probably also
like
because anything like would boost its
message
and if the whole point of tweeting is I
wanted to boost this message
I think that would be the decent thing
to do so I'm already going to change my
behavior
I'm going to hit like more often because
now I know it helps the person who
tweeted it
here's another one and it's a big
difference it's like a 30 times impact
if you have a lot of likes you get 30
times more exposure
30 times if you have a lot of likes
and if you have a lot of retweets you
get 20 times the exposure
so if people like it
then it will go to more people who like
it and then it will go to more people
who like it so the more people like it
the more people will see it to like it
so very interesting
here's one I did not see coming if you
use multiple hashtags
you're not getting ranked at all
didn't you think hashtags were helping
you
it turns out if you have more than one
hashtag they completely remove you from
the Boost you don't get any boost
and what I thought about it I agreed
with it
because if you have more than one
hashtag
you're usually a bot
you're really you're usually a tweet I
don't want to see
I almost never want to see a tweet that
has more than one hashtag
I never really thought about it but I
definitely don't like seeing a lot of
hashtags so Twitter helps me out
I'm you know that one was not obvious
how about uh
if you mention something that's trending
you get a little boost
so if you can you know make your thing
tied to the trending headline extra
boost
um here's one I did know about if you
have an image or a video attached you
get a two times boost
so here's what I did with my I always do
a tweet before my live stream
so today what I did was instead of
putting text which usually my tweet is
just text
and then a link to where to get it
apparently the other thing that they
downgrade
is external links
I'm not cool with that
to me that's not cool
here's why
I use Twitter for my own entertainment
of course but what Twitter gets out of
it is my eyeballs to look at their
advertisements
and I accept that agreement
because I like the product
and
advertisements are just part of the cost
so I pay that cost by you know my
attention
but a big big big reason that people
like me would use Twitter is to give
attention to outside links
that's my number one reason
my number one reason and I get
de-boosted for that
so here's what I tested I don't think
that I don't think that's an ethical I
don't think that's ethical let me just
say it that way I think this rule within
Twitter without being disclosed without
being disclosed is unethical
now that it's disclosed
I'm gonna I'm gonna think about it a
little bit more but not disclosing that
I consider it unethical
wouldn't you am I wrong about that
that de-boosting an external link
for someone who has a million followers
and I I
presumably I donate a lot to Twitter by
my activity because there's lots of
followers that can see advertisements
I to me that seems unethical
now that they've now that it's uh
transparent I'm going to give it a
temporary pass
because that's moving in the right
direction
I'd like to see that go away
what would you say I'd like to see that
go away and the reason I like to see it
go away is that it's good for me
but I also think it would be good for
other
people now but let's take you through
you know before we get Hasty if they
didn't down if they didn't de-boost
things with links
maybe that's all you'd see
everybody would just use it for free
advertising when in fact it's a platform
for their own advertising that's what
they built they didn't make a platform
for you to advertise
but how in the world could I advertise
my link
um unless I had a million followers
it's it's the fact that I built up
enough Goodwill in my Twitter feed that
people want to go there that's the only
reason that it's good for me to put a
link in there to an external source
otherwise I wouldn't bother
so
I think this one needs to be rethought
a little bit of rethinking on this topic
would be good maybe it's maybe this is
the best solution even for me it's
possible that I don't want to see that
many links in Twitter too
so maybe it makes sense
but I got questions this one's a little
sketchy to me
now here's some other things that'll
boost or don't boost your Twitter stuff
if you're verified you get a little
boost
um
if you oh let me finish my point so in
the tweets that uh send people to this
feed today
instead of making them all text
I just did a screenshot of part of my
text and attached it as an image
so instead of just text
some of it will appear to yeah 200 to be
an image
will that make a difference in theory it
should boosted by two even though the
Tweet says exactly the same thing now if
I had a link in it to an external Source
it would de-boost it and of course the
whole point of it was to put a link in
it but here's what I tried
I tried putting the link in the first
comment
so it's a separate tweet
[Music]
um
does that help
because it's not in the main tweet it's
in my own comment to my own tweet
I don't know we'll see
other things that boost you or don't
your content would be uh if it's Media
or news you get a boost if it's a trend
you get a boost so basically if it ties
into whatever's happening in the real
world you get a boost and you get
demoted if there's no text
so you see a lot of tweets where
somebody will just do an emoticon
and then refer to something they tweet
retweeted
or just a picture so I think you need to
picture plus text a URL a URL only will
be de-boosted I've done that a million
times I can't tell you how many times
I've tweeted just a URL
because it attaches it attaches the
image automatically I thought that was
good enough but apparently not URL by
itself is de-boosted and name only I
don't know what that means name only
if it's a non-news item it gets
de-boosted
and if it's a non-media thing it gets
debusted
and
they also calculate your account's
reputation all right here's one I don't
like at all
your accounts reputation
so you get more boost if you're an
upstanding Twitter user here's one of
the ways they decide if you're an
upstanding citizen
and let me tell you in advance
I hate this
you get de-boosted if you interact with
low quality accounts
trolls
if you answer a troll
you get debusted
I answer trolls every day as part of my
entertainment as part of the show
like I do it partly for my followers
partly because I like it it's just fun
but partly because it's just part of my
entertainment to show to show that I you
know dunked on a troll if it's funny
like I only do if it's funny I don't try
to do it otherwise
um but apparently I've been I've been
hurting my own business model
by interacting with low quality accounts
do you think that that should be a rule
I would think that if a big account
interacts with a small account
for any reason
that should be hell yes
to me that should be
an advantage I don't see that as making
my reputation go down
so I don't know what this means this one
I think requires another look
again I'm going to be I'm going to stop
short of saying it needs to change
because you know people put a lot of
thought into this I'm just sort of
entering the game so I'm open to a
better argument there might be an
argument that's good just the way it is
but I don't I just don't feel
that that makes the world a better place
I should be able to interact with
everybody small accounts
controversial accountants
just anybody anytime Twitter puts a a
limit on who I here's here's the best
way to say it
have I ever given you my rant about
anybody trying to uh limit who I talk to
or associate with
have I done that right lately because
you know I do it at least twice a year
and I'm going to do it right now nobody
can tell me who to talk to
nobody can tell me who to
associate with I will tweet whoever the
 I want for any reason whatsoever
you cannot tell me who to associate with
this is America I will associate
with the worst people in the world for
any reason I want could be for
entertainment could be because I want to
change their minds could be because it's
interesting could be because it's news
don't tell me who I can talk to
don't tell me who I can
associate with don't tell me who
I can retweet
and that's what Twitter's doing
now I know that I will be penalized
for associating with people that Twitter
believes are low quality
are you okay with that
are you okay with that
I'm not I'm not okay with that now I
will I will allow that there might be a
better argument that I'm aware of
for having this algorithm
but I doubt it's going to be good enough
because if you give me any any any any
 reason that I'm cut off from any
other people that I want to talk to
unacceptable
completely unacceptable
that's my take
and I don't mind being canceled because
I would rather associate any way I want
that's my preference
all right um let's see there's a list of
there's a file of blacklisted topics
but the file is not available to us do
you think you should be
so Elon is in favor of transparency and
I love everything about that so nothing
but compliments for that
but he released the code that determines
if you get boosted or suppressed but
part of the code addresses a database of
secret words
and if you use accidentally one of the
secret words you'll get de-boosted
I think transparency requires me to know
those words
am I wrong
it's not transparency if they don't tell
us what words
D Bruce Lee
yeah I'm totally right so I I haven't
heard anything from musk saying he would
or would not release release that
database I feel like he would
am I wrong
if if Elon Musk later said oh we can't
release the database of sensitive words
that de-boost you I would have some real
concerns about that
real concerns because that that would
allow you to boost or de-boost anything
independent of all those other rules
I mean maybe all the other rules don't
even kick in if you hit one of those bad
words do you think that you're going to
get an extra boost for having an image
attached if you said a bad word you know
one of the band categories I don't think
so my guess and I don't know this this
is speculation is is more like how I
would have built the system
if the banned words really matter
they would cancel all the rest of the
algorithm am I right
because that that would be the top
priority
because if you said uh the Holocaust is
not real
do you think that they care if you have
an image attached I don't think so
I think there's nothing you can do if
you trip one of the bad words that's my
guess because that's the way I would
have built it I would have built it you
hit that word you're done there's
nothing else to talk about
now
in normal Communications
I will swear because sometimes it brings
attention to something that you want to
highlight as I just did
right
um
so in normal Communications a strategic
amount of inappropriateness is actually
good communication did you know that
doing something that sort of violates an
expectation
shocks you just a little bit is actually
part of effective Communications
but Twitter is going to say oh you use
one of those attention-getting words
I'm going to give you no attention
I think that one needs to be re-examined
or we need to see the list
I say need but it's more of a request I
would request
and I in the name of transparency I
think we should see the banned words it
could be that when you see them you'll
agree with them totally right it's going
to be a bunch of you know anti-semitic
stuff and you're going to look at them
and say all right and I agree
but we should know
um New York Times said it's not going to
pay for Twitter
so it's not going to get verified
uh
uh why is that
is that such a big expense ten dollars a
month
that New York Times yeah it doesn't want
to
pay for their uh reporters to be on
Twitter
and verified and are you telling me that
a reporter a New York Times Reporter are
you telling me that they won't just get
their own verification
for ten dollars a month
because don't you think New York Times
reporters want to have lots of followers
because that's how they get their own
stories boosted they tweet their own
story
that's what gets it boosted that's how
they get raises and better jobs
so
maybe the company New York Times won't
pay for
pay for what he call a verified account
but I would think the reporters will
but my comment on this is if the New
York Times gets de-boosted
I don't know if that's bad
it's just one more fake news entity
getting de-boosted so what's the
difference
what's that say
all right
um
according to the Wall Street Journal the
the number of people who think that a
college degree is a good idea is way
down
um
42 percent of people in the recent
survey
said getting a college degree isn't
worth it
and that's a big increase from what they
used to say
um
what do you think
do you think this story is accurately
reported
that 42 percent of people think college
degrees aren't worth it
that was not accurately reported it's
not accurately reported at all it's not
even close to accurately reported allow
me to help
people who got degrees realized
that they were people who got
engineering degrees are enjoying their
careers and making lots of money
that's the story
the story is colleges are offering
 and and mostly women
if I may be sexist for a moment not you
know not completely women of course but
more women than men are taking the uh
let's say the the majors that don't have
a big career boost
and more men and women are taking stem
classes
so
I don't know it looks it looks to me
exactly the way it's supposed to look I
know to me people who take who get
valuable degrees believe they got
valuable degrees and the people who took
courses that were clearly not valuable
know that they took courses that are
clearly not valuable now may I add a
super sexist commentary on this who's up
for super sexism
super sexism anybody
in the form of entertainment
super sexism
I forgot what I was going to say
uh I actually did forget what I was
gonna say
it'll come back to me
uh
yeah it was really good though you know
if you'd heard it I believe you would
have enjoyed it
yeah
it'll come back to me
all right
um
let's see women and older Americans are
driving the decline in confidence in
college why do you think it is that
women and older Americans are driving oh
I got it I just remembered the super
sexist thing
correct me if I'm wrong
but when I went to college a billion
years ago
it was a common joke very sexist joke
to say that the if a young woman was in
college that she was there for Mrs
degree
you've heard that right
the Mrs degree
now
that would be one good reason to go to
college and people who went to college
and got married and met their future
husband or future wife would probably
have a better view of marriage or a
better View at College because College
definitely had that benefit it makes you
more marriageable
I would also argue
that a woman who wants to bag a high
income husband
which I believe is from you know
biological reasons is entirely
appropriate
um it's just a natural impulse that the
best way to do that would be to go to
college yourself even if you got a
 degree am I right
a woman with a college degree
is more likely to attach
to get a high income husband
because the high income husband you know
is looking for somebody who has maybe
similar credentials
um now fast forward to today
does your college experience help you
get married in 2023
yes or no no it makes it far less likely
you'll get married because college is
what may is what makes you unappealing
to men
in 2023
let me say that again
in the 70s
a woman with a college degree any kind
any kind of college degree I would
automatically say hmm
there's somebody I could have a
conversation with
all right if they needed to work
optionally if they needed to maybe a
little boost and I would say that's
definitely like one more variable in the
marriageable department now I would not
limit myself to somebody who went to
college
all right that's not like a requirement
or anything but it'd be one thing you'd
put on the on the good pile right and in
fact my first my first marriage
it was not like that so
so it wasn't something that I had to
hide on my own list but it's a plus it's
a little bit of a plus
now in 2023 would you want to even
associate with a young woman who had a
typical liberal arts college degree
I wouldn't even want to have a
conversation
and I'm not even joking
that's like an actual serious opinion no
hyperbole I would not be interested in a
conversation
of any kind
of any kind
because I believe that young women who
are going to college have been
um
brainwashed or polluted or educated if
you wanted to say it in a positive way
educated to have a negative opinion
about me
before they've met me
am I right
when I walk into a room do I look like
I'm part of the patriarchy
oh yeah I got patriarchy written all
over me I mean my middle name is
patriarchy yeah you see this this uh
this white guy of a certain age walk
into a room I assume anybody under 25
dislikes me
I just assumed because they would be
trained that I am the devil
and if I said you know I used to think
Donald Trump had some good tools and
2016. I thought he'd be solid president
I would never be able to have any
conversation with a young woman after
they knew that that'd be the end of it
right so
the value of college has decreased not
just for its economic value well I guess
getting marriages marriage is an
economic value yeah I guess it's all
full of the money isn't it even getting
married is basically an economic plan
was that sexist enough or just right
is it just right
I think I I think that was just enough
spiciness
to get you a little little extra flavor
there all right you're welcome
I asked this question on Twitter in my
highly scientific Twitter poll what is
the bigger risk to America climate
change or the combination of Dei CRT and
ESG
well this might say more about my
audience than it does about the topic
but the answer was four percent thought
climate change was the bigger risk and
96 percent thought the bigger
existential risk to America was Dei CRT
and the SG and I agree with that
I agree with that
and to me that's obvious
because with climate change
it could get bad
but we'll find ways to adjust and
compensate and we'll figure it out
you know no matter what happens with
climate no matter who's causing it or
not causing it I feel like we're going
to figure that out
but the Dei CRT ESG stuff
that could be a kill shot
to me that could be a kill shot that
could take you right off of the map
because this is a bug in the software
right uh climate change is sort of a
hardware problem
literally we build machines
you know this is the climate change
story we build machines the machines do
bad things for the climate
um
so that's a that's a hardware problem we
can fix Hardware problems
fairly reliably if we have time to do it
but the Dei crtesg is a psychological
problem that I'll call a software
problem a software problem can take you
offline right away and can put you out
of business forever you know it was bad
enough
so I think people are right
now obviously if it were a Democrat
majority you're voting for this it would
be opposite ISO
but I don't think Democrats have a full
understanding of the cost
let's say the unintended cost of all of
the equity stuff the unintended cost is
in this driving population that you want
to interact with because they have all
the resources and the jobs
that population wants to have nothing to
do with you if you're infected with that
mind that mindset
it's not about race
you know white or black younger old if
you have this mindset that white people
took all your stuff and they'd better
give it back
I don't want to be around you
I don't want anything to do with you at
all not economically not socially not in
any way I don't want to have any
involvement with people who are poisoned
mentally poisoned
all right
um
so this will give you uh
let's say a read of the room
if you want to know the temperature of
the room
even understand the most of my Twitter
followers are leaning leaning right or
independent
here's what I tweeted and I'll tell you
in advance it got a million retweets
now I have over 900 000 followers
but to get over a million retweets
that doesn't happen a lot you know that
right normal retweets for me would be
ten to forty thousand
ten to forty thousand on a pretty solid
tweet
if you get a million tweet retweets you
hit you hit a nerve all right so this
one this one hit a nerve and it said Dei
is essentially a hunting license for
Democrats to identify and eliminate
conservatives from the military
government education and the workplace
you can prove me wrong with an example
of a conservative heading up a Dei
Department
there are no about
I mean I don't know nobody's proven it
yet but do you think there's even one
white male conservative who would ever
be considered to head up a Dei
Department
nope
now this is nothing but a hunting
license
which allows Democrats to hunt
Republicans conservatives
it's a hunting license
it's nothing else
and once you hear that it's hard to
think of it another way isn't it it's
just a license to attack conservatives
that's all it is
it got me
it got me
because it was a I'm sure it was the Dei
entities within within the groups that
canceled me of course it was the Dei
people that's their job if you get hired
to look for ghosts you're gonna find
some ghosts because that's how you get
paid if you get hired to look for
racists you're gonna find some racists
lots of them because that's how you get
paid
so we've we've created a system
in which we've actually intentionally
inserted the thing that will destroy the
company
which is a change of focus to ridiculous
things instead of profitability
so
um I think this this issue is the killer
issue
for the next election
I think if a republican candidate
now Vivek has done a great job in
speaking out against these corrosive
ideas
but I think this framing is the
strongest I've seen yet that it's a
hunting license
for republicans
agree because when you hear hunting
license that's a whole different feeling
than oh we disagree on some things
no you're hunting me
you're actually stalking me let me ask
you this prior to me being canceled
do you think there were any entities
that were poised and waiting and
watching
literally stalking
my public activities to to look for the
little uh little opportunity to jump in
yes no yes they were not ignoring me
until I did something wrong they were
hunting
they were hunting
do you think any of the other big
accounts that might be pro-republican in
some way do you think any of them else
are being watched carefully
well yeah because they're looking to get
rid of your Matt Walsh's and your
everybody else's you know the a lot of
them are safe because they're in
entities that are going to protect them
but yeah they're all being watched now
the thing that I had that made me uh
unsafe
was exactly the thing that I thought
made me safe so I had that completely
wrong I thought having
thousands of clients
would make me safe because even if a few
got mad I still have thousands
but I didn't understand that I'd have
choke points and that the Dei people
could go after the choke point the
publisher and just turn it all off
but if I had worked for let's say the
daily wire or the blaze or something and
a whole bunch of Democrats didn't like
me well
so what
it wouldn't make any difference at all I
was still at my job and the people who
paid me would be happy that Democrats
didn't like me
right so I was way more vulnerable than
I thought but now I've moved my business
into a subscription model
so that I can protect myself
and by the way the the value of the
locals platform and Rumble that bought
locals or merged with it the value of
the locals platform to free speech
is just incalculable
you literally can get canceled and then
still have a life after cancellation and
I'm not sure that was true when Roseanne
got canceled
remember when Roseanne got canceled
where did she go nowhere
nowhere because there was no place to go
she was just out of business now she's
back but
but if if she had done that when you
know maybe she's not the ideal person to
be on locals maybe she is but you could
imagine she could have you know just
recreated a different base of popularity
with different tools
Robert says hunting is a more
conservative Meme and you're digging
yourself further into extremism and
marginalization than necessary
um I like that comment
I like that comment but let me tell you
that I'm surfing the sun intentionally
all right
good advice would be hey stay away from
the Sun you'll get burned
I know that I know it's safer I don't
want to be safe
I'm not attempting to keep myself safe
I'm trying to make a point because I
think it's important I think it's
important for our survival
actually our survival if we have to get
this stuff right and it's very wrong
right now
we've got to figure some way not to hate
each other over politics and Dei stuff
and and not take our eyes off
the profitability and the well-being of
the country
so yes calling it hunting
is uh Pro let's say it's evocative of or
remind you of
extremism
and then it got your attention didn't it
did it get your attention
it got your attention enough to make a
comment and saying it was dangerous
so if I got your attention that's all I
want I don't want your safety I don't
want your protection
I don't don't need it
I only want you to pay attention
there you go
all right
um I don't think that the attacks on Dei
where we cleverly change the letters to
to d i e
I get it it's clever
but there's no persuasive punch to that
it's just sort of an interesting thing
that's all
uh
all right
haunted Us in Las Vegas
you got haunted in Las Vegas
now
am I dangerous
just just occurred him to me to ask that
I see a lot of yeses if you knows
the the locals people are more likely to
say yes
they've seen more of my toolbox
oh this is interesting there's quite a
split YouTube is uh almost all knows
that I'm not dangerous with some yeses
and locals is mostly yes with a few no's
that's quite a difference
interesting
um
well I'm dangerous to some things
I'm sure I'm dangerous to some things
all right let me ask you another uh
narcissistic question
but so this is purely narcissistic if
you'd like to see it that way but I kind
of need to know
like I actually need to know this
am I in the top 20 of people influencing
politics no not top 20 top 20 people
top 20 individuals
right locals we've got some yeses and
no's more yeses than those
on YouTube
lots of yeses but lots of no's pretty
mixed
now the people who say no
what what do you think
all right I gotta call out the idiot the
NPC all right somebody named decadence
uh their comment in all capital letters
is arrogant arrogant oh oh arrogant now
you idiot I started this by
saying is narcissistic
but it also has a utility
that is just clearly an NPC You couldn't
possibly be a real functioning human
with a brain
that you thought shouting that in all
caps was additive or what entertaining
like do your fingers just move like oh
just automatically or something
my God
oh my God
uh
now the thing that bothers me is the
boredom of it I don't know if that's
coming through the the sheer lack of
creativity actually just hurts me it's
like oh
like
do something different than that
anything just anything different than
all caps agreeing with me like you're
disagreeing or arrogant well although
arrogant oh
God you're so predictable
anyway
all right so my view is that anybody
who's in the top 20 people who influence
politics is going to be targeted for
removal either by the left or the right
so everybody who's in the that
top 20 influencer Group by the way
you did see that Mike cernovich is
almost certainly the reason that
DeSantis made the statement he did about
that didn't mention Trump but it was
about D.A Bragg
that was entirely in my opinion and I
think Mike cernovich's opinion as well
that was entirely one person
and that mattered
like that that was a moment that the
whole at least the right was watching
the whole world really that was an
important
framing moment and he made that happen
one person so as Mike cernovich in the
top 20 people who can make who can
change politics
oh yeah
yeah he's in the he might be in the top
three
he might be the top one
you know depending on what the topic is
yeah and of course you know some people
are more influential on some topics than
others but yeah
yeah I mean top 20 easily
top five I would argue
and if it was top two or three I
wouldn't even be surprised at all
all right
um
who else is in that category of people
who are not just entertaining
but influential
they actually like a policy will change
because of something musk of course
Tucker of course Steve Bannon probably
Russell Brand I haven't seen it yet Gad
sad I think he's actually influenced
politics I believe gadsat is another one
yeah
uh
uh you know I haven't seen Bill Maher
influence politics
I've seen him say things I like
but I haven't seen it change much yeah
Elon Musk for sure Jordan Peterson
I don't know Jordan Peterson is insanely
uh influential
on on a personal development kind of way
but politics
Maybe
bongino
David sacks that's a perfect example
David sacks yeah Matt Walsh
Joe Rogan
Jonathan Turley
Matt taibi now Michael schellenberger
Michael schellenberger is moving the
needle a lot
yeah I mean I would say outside of
politics yeah so Trump and
you know other people are influential in
politics Andrew Tate uh less so for
American politics I don't think he
entertain his
moving the bar in America
politics
Corey DeAngelis good name yes Corey
DeAngelis is
single-handedly the biggest oh uh yeah
James O'Keefe
this is sort of a special case but yes
Miranda Devine
oh yeah Ruffo rufo
uh I don't know about Alex Jones
just because I don't follow the show as
much Mr Beast I don't think so
Tom Fenton
um
well
I guess I need an example of that
that could he he might be changing
politics
all right
so um yeah Gutfeld of course
so
yeah if if you if you don't count people
who are TV hosts or elected politicians
or running to be elected
there aren't that many people who are
moving moving the needle
who don't have that job well I suppose I
have that job in my own way
Candace Megan Kelly
Sonny Johnson all right I've seen a lot
of names but but would you agree that at
least
where it concerns
um Republican related stuff
would you agree that there are about 20
people who are the one Tim pool would
you agree there are about 20 people who
make a difference
and that if the 20 you make a difference
probably the top ten
or 80 of the difference
yeah top ten are probably 80 and top 20
are probably all of it
probably just about all of it oh yeah
Victor David Hansen good name yeah but
you know some of those people are famous
but not influential
you know what I mean
let let and I'll use Victor David Anson
as an example I don't know if he's
influential
I know he adds a lot to conversations
like I know that if you listen to Victor
David Hansen your understanding of
context will be improved immediately
that might change your mind about
something but he but here's why I'm
questioning his influence
he pretty much is uh
right on the Republican conservative
narrative
am I wrong
so he he may be
adding context to help people
to help people maybe strengthen their
arguments
and that's valuable too
oh maybe that's that's a form of
influence yeah
but
um the reason somebody like a cervich
has extra juice
well there's lots of reasons he has
extra juice I mean he's a singular
personality you can't reproduce him and
he has special talents
uh
but but the fact that he's an
independent and you don't actually know
where he's going to come out on anything
have you noticed that
with certain events you never really
know
it could sort of go anyway and and his
unpredictability is a big part of his
appeal so that's more that's more
persuasive because when he takes a what
looks to you like a contrarian opinion
you stop immediately
you go oh what's this what's this
contrarian opinion I gotta I gotta
listen to this
yeah so he does have powers that you
don't have
uh how would anyone know the answer yeah
um
Gordon Chang
yeah Gordon Chang uh
has been a consistent you know China
Hawk and yeah he probably has made a
difference I think you're right and
specifically on one topic now some
people are more influential on some
topics than others
right so
uh
yeah all right so that's and prageru is
influential too yes all right that's all
I got for today I'm going to say bye to
the YouTube people it looked like my
clever Twitter tweeting tricks didn't
work at all looks like the same same
size crowd as every day
so
um I guess now I have a question whether
those
those Twitter algorithm tricks are real
because it looks like I just tested it
didn't make any difference
but let's find out
I won't really see the number until I
quit you on YouTube and then I'll tell
the locals people what it looked like
bye for now YouTube thanks for joining
best
