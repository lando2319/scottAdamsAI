[Music]
hey everybody good morning and welcome
to
coffee with scott adams best time of the
day every single day
and uh today is going to be a special
one
how special
oh wow
i'm not even going to talk about mass
and
vaccinations until maybe maybe the very
end
so if you love that stuff i'm only going
to talk about one point of logic
but before then let's enjoy the other
stuff the reason you come here we're
talking about the funny news and the
persuasion uh filter on it but all you
need to make this an extra special day
is a copper mugger classic tanker
chelsea stay in the canteen jungle flask
a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid and i
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better
except the afghanistan withdrawal it's
called this simultaneous step what
happens now go
ah yeah it's a little extra good today
a little extra delicious
well here's uh news
let's call this building block news
building block news
it's news that by itself doesn't seem
that big but it's part of a larger
uh structure
and here's the news there's uh now the
first autonomous
shipping ship
that's what they call them it's a ship
that ships things so that be a shipping
ship
you could call it a container ship if
you like but it's electric
and it's unmanned or as we say
unpersoned
and it's the first one so that you're
going to monitor it remotely and this
thing will
use its electricity to
go around in a very green way and not
pollute the world
now why is this a big deal
well if container ships become electric
and autonomous
and we're already seeing that there are
plans in maybe a year or two to have the
first electric
commercial airliners
so if you could get rid of carbon fuel
on container ships
and air travel
it's a pretty big deal it's a pretty big
deal so it's a little story that's part
of a bigger story
i do expect that all of our automobiles
will be electric and autonomous
fairly soon you know when you drive have
you noticed that the least important
part of the car process is the human
like all of the error
of an automobile
is all built around the fact that people
want to feel like they're driving
because you could easily get rid of that
part and it would be much safer i mean
we're already at the place
pretty sure i think elon musk would
probably agree with this statement
don't know but i think we're already at
the point where we could build
autonomous cars that would be safer than
human driven cars here's the thing that
i think every time i'm driving and i'm
using my navigation
so i'm driving along and i'm thinking to
myself hey look at me i'm in charge of
driving my car
with my free will and everything and
then my gps says turn right at the next
intersection and then i turn right
because that's where i want to go that's
why i set the gps navigation for that
but
the car already knew it needed to take
the right turn
and the car knew where the right turn
was in fact the car knew where the right
turn was before i did
the only weakness in the system
is me
i have to listen to it and then execute
if you could get me out of that
it's got to be a better system so i'm
driving but i'm thinking i'm the just
ridiculous part of this this system
if you looked at the whole system of you
know buying a car getting it on the
highway building highways
you know making this whole commun uh
telecommute not
this whole uh
transportation network
the human part is the stupid part like
you would never engineer that into your
systems but because we think we're
special we do
so it's all going to be electric and
autonomous soon
here is the best story in the news but
let's call it a sign of the times
it's a sign of the times this is the
actual headline on fox news
woman banned from zoo
after unhealthy relationship with chimp
he loves me she said
and when they banned her she was quite
sad she says it's all i have
and she she would visit the zoo on a
very regular basis for years and she
thought that she had fallen in love with
one of the gyms so one of the chimps
would come over and they would blow
kisses to each other and interact
but the zoo thought that she was ruining
the chimp she was making making the
chimp too too much like a human
and it sort of ruined the chimps
interaction and
so they banned her from the zoo
but that's not the big story
here's the big story
if you're a man
don't you already have enough
competition for human women
i mean it's hard enough
you know if you're not that good looking
you know maybe your job isn't that good
it's really hard to get a
get a girlfriend get a wife
and that's just competing against humans
you know when you're competing against
other human males the bar is pretty low
right
i mean
men kind of create
you know not really the highest standard
in the world so
competing against other men i always
think well i think i've got a shot
against those other men
but if i have to compete against chimps
too
can you imagine competing against a
chimp
you get a chimp
that thing is never going to talk back
the woman will be like
brat and will the gym say
oh you know the game's on
no
no that chimp will just groom you and
listen to your story you can complain
all day and that chimp will just go
or whatever jim spank
so i'm very unhappy that i will someday
have to compete
possibly with chimps
um
have you ever had the experience of
having an ex
who changed sides after after you were
with them
in other words uh if you ever had a if
you're a man have you ever had a
girlfriend who after you dated her she
decided to become a lesbian
i've had that experience
in college
uh there was a young lady
who was very inexperienced and wanted me
to change that situation and i did
and after i changed that situation for
her
she thought about it and she thought you
know
i think i could just do women after this
now
i like to think it was going to happen
anyway
i'd like to think
the the natural arc of her life was she
was born lesbian and she just needed to
find out and you know once she found out
it was going to happen one way or
another
that's one explanation
the other possibility
is that interacting with me was so bad
she said to herself i i think i could go
my whole life without doing this again
so let's just say that wasn't my biggest
success
but i like to think it would have
happened anyway
kamala harris her flight from singapore
was delayed
because of uh
havana syndrome
have you heard of it
havana syndrome
and that's where they they speculate
the professionals do that there's some
kind of secret sonic weapon that some
kind of rival or terrorist is shooting
at embassies and making people sick it's
hurting their brains in some horrible
way
and
so now there's a report
that this is happening in singapore
now what did i tell you about
havana syndrome and the secret sonic
weapon
what was my prediction the first time we
heard about this in havana
i told you
it's not real
that whatever it is is not going to be a
secret sonic weapon i mean it might be
real damage and it might be a real
phenomenon of some sort but i'll tell
you what it's not
a secret sonic weapon now if i'm wrong
on this one
nothing would make me more surprised and
i like this prediction because i'm the
only one
right i'm the only one with this
prediction so how's my prediction doing
that this story was always from
moment one
how does that prediction look well
here's
apparently there's another attack in
singapore
so does that mean i'm wrong
because these attacks keep happening
well there's a little detail about this
story that maybe you missed
that the two people who had these
anomalous health outcomes
that's that has been called havana
syndrome turns out they were working at
home
that's right
the diplomats
who who
had this
secret sonic weapon attacked them
were in singapore
and working at home
so apparently this terrorist who has the
secret sonic weapon
track them down at their homes
just to zap them at home
because that's exactly what you would do
if you were a terrorist and you had the
wherewithal to take your secret sonic
weapon
and go all over the world it's been in
canada it's been it's been in havana and
now it's in singapore so you've got the
wherewithal to get into all of these
countries with your secret sonic weapon
and your best bet was to hunt people
down one by one at their home office
no
no
it's not happening i don't know what's
happening you know maybe some kind of
phenomenon for real but it's not a
secret sonic weapon
can we just
agree that we've debunked that now
because there's nobody with there's no
terrorist with a secret sonic weapon
who's hunting people down at their home
office
that's not happening
all right
um
somebody's saying it's a satellite i
don't know about that
my favorite tweet of the day from
michael malus if you don't follow
michael malus on twitter
you're missing some real good
entertainment
those of you who follow him uh are
probably already laughing because the
funny thing about him is that
he doesn't take any prisoners
he's got a point of view that's probably
different from yours but
man does he hold that point of view
and and he does a hilarious job of
doing it but anyway his tweet today was
uh quote
at this rate saddam hussein will be back
in power by ramadan
that's a pretty good tweet
pretty good tweet saddam hussein will be
back in power by robin
all right
let me
surprise you by saying
that biden
might be doing a really good job on
persuasion with this afghanistan thing
now not i'm not saying it's not botched
it does look to me just like it looks to
you and apparently everybody else in the
world
it looks like the afghanistan withdrawal
is botched
but that doesn't mean every single thing
that biden is doing is completely wrong
might be yeah we could find out every
single thing he's doing is wrong but i'm
going to point out one thing that you
think is wrong the news is reporting it
as a mistake
but in my opinion clearly isn't and it
goes like this
so i guess biden is telling people oh
yeah we'll get those americans out
by august 31st
and at the same time he's saying that in
public
apparently um congress was being briefed
that that's not going to happen
by biden's own people
so
what's happening is biden have dementia
he's out of the loop doesn't know what's
happening so why is biden saying oh yeah
we'll get out of there by august 31st
well all the people who know what
they're talking about say no there's no
way
so is that a by mistake
what do you think
mistake
i don't think so i don't think so
here's why i think he's playing it
exactly right
and
i'll be even doubly offensive by saying
trump might have done this
right that's that's a big stretch
because we don't know what he would or
would not have done
but i feel this is very trumpian and
i'll tell you why
because biden is talking to the taliban
he's not talking to you
when biden talks to taliban he says yes
you've got a deadline
we absolutely are going to meet that
and what does that do to the taliban
makes the taliban feel like they're
getting what they want
so are they going to be more or less
flexible about letting people out
between now and august 31st
in theory
they would be more flexible because
they're getting everything they want
as soon as they stopped doing that
giving us everything they want you'd
kind of expect that biden would have to
stop
being as accommodating
so i have a feeling that biden is
talking to the taliban basically
treating them with the respect they
haven't earned
because it's going to make it easier to
get our hostages out hostages our
our americans and afghan allies it's
easier to get them out if the taliban
thinks they're winning
now as long as the news is correctly
reporting and biden would have known
this
biden would have known that the news
will tell the united states public it's
not going to happen by august 31st
it's kind of perfect
because you the public are completely
informed all right there's no there's no
mystery here we're not going to get them
out by august 31st you know things just
don't work that smoothly there's always
going to be somebody left
so you're getting the correct
accurate story
and you're even getting it through the
biden administration because they
briefed congress
and it wasn't secret
so congress immediately ran to their
microphones and said hey
the people who know what they're talking
about say we can't do this
so you got the accurate news that's good
you like accurate news
and the pa and the taliban got a
different message they said hey the
government of the united states is going
to try to meet your deadline
i feel like he nailed it
i don't think this looks like a case of
dementia to me this looks more like
somebody playing two different games at
the same time and winning both of them
now i'm not saying that the withdrawal
is a success
it looks like it's a pretty botched
situation but in that narrow sense
his two different messages at the same
time to two different audiences
it looks spot on
well i think i might have ever
recommended it you know if i'd been
there i think i might have recommended
he did it exactly that way i don't know
so
we can't know for sure if that's why
anything is happening
but it's it would be a lucky a lucky
accident if they didn't do it
intentionally
the taliban meanwhile is uh not only
trying to hunt down people who helped
the americans
um but
in at least one case and i feel
there's a big risk there'll be more of
this killing the family members
of the people they're looking for
so if the family members won't give up
the family member you know and tell you
where they are
they kill the family members
so
if you're not trying hard enough to get
out of afghanistan with your whole
family
maybe you ought to try harder
and i suspect that there will be a
number of afghans and this is just a
horrible thought
there will be a number of afghans who
helped america who will either
surrender and be killed
knowing that they'll be killed
um
let's get rid of dr johnson he's just
like
my mascot
goodbye
is like my my biggest troll
i have to ban him every day
but uh i've got a feeling that you'll
see afghans uh either killing themselves
or um
or surrendering to be killed so that
their families are not killed
so i mean i can't imagine anything more
horrible than what's gonna happen after
after the taliban takes complete control
all right in the category of trump was
right one of my better predictions which
was that as days went by
uh trump would look more right
the history would would give him a much
better grade
than the news was giving him while he
was in while he was in office
and here we go again this the supreme
court ruled against the biden
administration in its attempt to end the
remain in mexico program
so trump had that deal where where the
immigrants could be
the illegal immigrants could be kept in
mexico biden tried to end it
and the supreme court i don't
i can't understand the details of this
but they basically kept it in place now
that doesn't mean it'll happen does it
does that mean we'll actually go back to
remain in place i feel like that's not
going to happen so i don't know if this
story has any importance because
i don't know i just don't see you see
that you can force the government to do
this if they don't want to do it i feel
like
biden will have more options to not do
it
but
supreme court ruled with uh ruled with
trump
and i think we can see that trump was
better on immigration probably would
have been better on afghanistan or or we
believe it you know no way to know
um
all right
who predicted this
all right let's see how many of you
years ago predicted this
that
china's birth rate is so low that
they've got a problem
so
your
did anybody think that china would stop
reproducing now now we know
that china had that two
was it one child or two child policy the
one child policy
where they were trying to stop over
population
did you ever think that china would go
from
trying to stop growth of population
that's too much
to having a crisis of too few
somebody says musk predicted it but did
he predict it 20 years ago is what i'm
asking
it's the 20 years ago that's the hard
part
i think everybody predicted it in the
last five years
because the data showed it
so now china is saying that you can have
up to three kids
and the chinese women are saying no
thanks
hey you can have three kids now
no thanks
now here's the thing
uh play this out to the future
let's say china
becomes
an increasingly crappy place to live and
reproduce and let's say that the chinese
people don't have enough money
in their economy that want three kids
so let's say that china's
demographic problem just keeps getting
worse
compare that to the united states
now i think the birth rate in a lot of
industrialized countries is decreasing
or going negative
so if the united states did not have
immigration
could it remain a
top country i think the answer is no
because i think the united states would
not have a birth rate
that would support our you know dominant
economic position into the future i'm
talking 20 30 years into the future and
so
here's the question
does immigration and the fact that the
united states will always have some form
of it
whereas china will probably not
is that a competitive advantage or
disadvantage go
now here i'm assuming that we control
our immigration so it's not just open
borders all right i think we're going to
go back to a better control
but if the u.s can bring in good people
or just people you know just bodies
does that give us an advantage in the
long run over china
and i'd be interested i'm just i'm
seeing advantage
disadvantage yes
i think china is doomed
unless they open their borders and i
don't see that happening
do you
um and then here's the second part of
this and the fun part
as you know we're in a long-term
sort of a cold war with china
meaning that we're trying to
they're trying to persuade our public
and we're they're trying to steal our
digital assets and everything
sending us fentanyl so they're doing all
these things
i don't know what we're doing in return
but i'll tell you what we could do in
return
we could persuade chinese citizens to
have fewer kids
and it would destroy china in 30 years
now
how hard would it be to persuade people
to have fewer kids
not that hard
for
in terms of things which you can and
cannot persuade people to do
that would be one you could
because we see that people are being
persuaded by their um mostly by their
economic expectations
so the reason that the chinese women are
saying no thanks on the three children
is they don't think they can afford it
they don't think the economy will allow
them to easily have three children
so could you persuade
the population of china through indirect
means you know intel
agencies etc could you persuade chinese
students or the young chinese people
that it's a dumb idea to have three
children
because you can't afford it
yeah you could
as persuadable things that's pretty
persuadable now if you try to tell them
to have no children good luck right that
would be working against their biology
too hard you probably couldn't do that
but you could get people from three to
two
very pretty easily
right you just make it look like having
three children is a freaking nightmare
and having two is uh yeah you did your
job you're you're good person
so yes we could destroy china
with
persuasion about how many children they
should have
completely doable and we we can start
that today i mean you know it'd be a
long-term project
but you could destroy the whole con the
economy by telling them to stop having
kids
all right um
years ago i had the following idea for
how to solve afghanistan i don't
remember if i ever said it publicly
so if anybody ever heard me say it
publicly let me know and the idea looked
like this
you know that anybody who goes into
afghanistan
is in trouble right
so russia goes in and they get the
soviet union and they get crushed they
have to leave
the united states goes in and it's a
debacle
now china is looking to be the big
influence that's what i always wanted to
happen
will that will the taliban operate
uh as freely let's say allowing
terrorist bases and stuff if china gets
more of a grip on the country
because china i don't think china's
ambition is to just do business with the
taliban is it
i think china's ambition is to dominate
afghanistan
so if afghanistan is a long
range risk to the united states
what's the best way to control it
give it to china
because china will control the hell out
of it
look at the uyghurs
right it's not good
i'm not suggesting this is moral or
ethical
but china
could exert enough control over
afghanistan with money and all the all
of their various ways that eventually
they would just be able to control
whether afghanistan had any terrorist
camps
one way or another i mean it might not
be militarily they might just say well
you know we're going to stop
supporting you financially
unless you get rid of those camps
because they're a problem for us it's
gonna it's gonna mess up our supply
chain
because once china gets a supply chain
from afghanistan let's say it's
uh the rare minerals they're not gonna
want to let go of that and they're not
going to want the taliban to control it
they're going to want to control it
themselves
so
john says scott is wrong on china
how do you know
can you see the future
did you know that china would have a
population problem did you know the
taliban would take over in weeks
you didn't know any of that stuff you
don't know i'm wrong on china
you just know that i could be
that's why you know
you don't know i'm wrong
you just know i could be and even i
think that
even i think i could be wrong
but
i don't see
enough a strategic advantage for china
except for the minerals
that maybe doesn't compensate for the
fact that they might reduce terrorism
there in a way that we couldn't or
wouldn't because they'd be more brutal
about it
so maybe maybe we're safer if china
controls them because china is one risk
whereas china plus the taliban breeding
terrorists would be two risks
so does it take one risk or does it take
two risks and turn it into one risk it
could
what are the chances
not high you know not a hundred percent
but it could happen
um rasmussen polls asked is the u.s
safer from terrorist attack
than it was before 9 11.
what do you think
are we safer from terrorist tech now
uh or before 9 11.
well 51 say we're not any safer than
before 9 11.
that's not good
and 34 say yes we are safer
um
i don't know that this is a question
that anybody really can answer because
it only takes one big terrorist attack
to wipe out all the average of all the
terrorist attacks you know for decades
so
i don't know if there's any such thing
as an average risk when it comes to
terrorism so i'm not sure the question
makes complete sense except in how
people feel
and half of the country feels
that we're not any safer
i don't know that they're wrong are they
um but we've had
uh you know knock on wood
uh an unusually good run without
terrorism i i have to think that the
complete lack of
of personal privacy is what's stopping
all the terror attacks
would you say that's true
don't you think that your complete and
total lack of privacy
is why there have been no terror attacks
i would love to see somebody who knows
what they're talking about look into
that
but it feels like there would just have
to be terrorist attacks
like way more of them
unless we had so much control of
information that we could see them
before they start
and i think that's where we're at
i think
i'm seeing a little bit of disagreement
on me
what would be the other reason that
there are no terrorist attacks
i'm seeing lots of no's especially on
youtube
but what what would be the other
hypothesis
because you were not aware
oh that there are attacks but i'm not
aware of them
maybe
maybe they're more cyber attacks
um
yeah this but the cyber attacks are
different terrorists right
it's not like one morphed into the other
yeah i don't see
i can't think of any mechanism
that would have stopped all the presumed
terrorism between 9 11 and now
except for the complete lack of
privacy and i remember during 9 11 when
you know the privacy question became big
i always thought
there's no way it can go any other way
you will lose all of your privacy
because you'll prefer security now you
didn't get a choice it just happened but
i feel like it might have been the right
choice
we'll never know because you don't know
what attacks you prevented
you only know what happened not what
didn't happen
have you seen the trump video attack ad
on biden and his
afghan situation and his other problems
oh my god
trump
is back
[Laughter]
and it's brutal
if you haven't seen trump's brand new
video
mocking biden and attacking him for
everything it it juxtaposes just
horrible
things about afghanistan and bad
decisions and bad predictions
against every once a while to show them
falling on the stairs walking up to the
the plane
i mean it's devastating so they'll show
biden messing up something or
saying something dumb like afghanistan
will go smoothly a week before it
doesn't
and then they'll show him gaffing and
they'll show him falling down on the
stairs
oh it's good
it makes the case that he's
not not in his right mind
and not capable like really well he uses
visual persuasion
he uses humor
to get your attention makes it viral
and he uses fear
what's better
and and by the way how do you put fear
and humor in the same video
he did it
well whoever made it did it jumped into
it himself but it's really good
like just in persuasion so you can make
your own judgment about whether it's
fair or accurate but persuasion-wise
that's damn good
uh all right
apparently there's a new report intel
report that says uh about the coveted
origin we don't know where it came from
are you surprised about that
when you heard that
there was all this effort to find out
the the real origin of the coronavirus
or the uh at least the kovalev 19
did you think they were going to find it
because i didn't i heard that i heard
that and i thought how the hell
would you know where it came from
well it just doesn't seem doable does it
and then sure enough it wasn't done now
i suppose if you had some kind of you
know whistleblower or
uh can you do genetic testing to find
out that the virus must have come from
somewhere
i don't know to me it just didn't seem
possible when it started and sure enough
um apparently china is pushing a pretty
hard
persuasion war
uh especially in their own country
so within china you're being told that
the virus probably originated in the
united states
at fort kendrick
and i guess there used to be some
viral
research there
not anymore but the uh oh well i don't
know if it's not anymore but anyway
china is telling using their control
over their own media to tell their local
population that you know probably
probably derived from uh
is it dietrich yeah
fort dietrich
so
china is actually selling this story so
if you live in china
the news you heard is that the
coronavirus came from the united states
and specifically from that fort
now
if china is doing this to us and you
know just making up news like this
are we doing the same thing
can anybody tell me if our
intel people are putting fake news into
china
i assume so
right but why don't we ever hear about
that it's interesting
all right um
i have uh
one analogy i would like to give you
um this would be the point where the
people who don't like hearing the
persuasion or
logic discussions
that involve
vaccinations
this is where you can turn it off
but i'm not talking about whether you
should get it or not the only question
is
how do you explain that vaccinations
might cause more variance
and i asked that question and got all
kinds of cognitive dissonance how do i
know it's cognitive dissonance
i don't know that every answer was
cognitive dissonance
i do know
that almost all the answers were
cognitive dissonance because they were
different
and most of them made no sense
it's really easy to see
that
it's cognitive dissonance
but i try to come up with
a way to make my point and i'm going to
test it out
and i've told you many times that
analogies don't
replace reason right so if i tried to
make an argument with an analogy
you'd say to yourself well that's a bad
argument you said so yourself
so see what i'm doing here if i've told
you analogies do not persuade
why am i why am i going to use one here
it goes
if you shoot all the horses in one
country
will it cause rabbits to evolve more
quickly in a different country
go
what do you think if you shoot all the
horses in one country that has no
connection whatsoever to a separate
country
would it make the rabbits in the second
country
evolve faster
no because there's no causal connection
whatsoever right
no way
but
if you make a vaccination
that works on both
regular coronavirus let's call it alpha
and the variant delta it works on both
of them but it works a little better
on the original
will that cause the delta
or other variants to be more aggressive
and is that exactly like
shooting horses in one country
causes rabbits to reproduce differently
in a different country
well here's the question
if all the viruses were competing for
resources
somebody says that's a terrible analogy
right
it's a terrible analogy
and here's the punch line
it's the main reason people are arguing
that
that the vaccinations cause
more variance
that analogy is their reason i just
changed the country and the animals
so the the argument is that if you
suppress the the one
variant
it makes the the other variant stronger
how
how does it do that
now that's the question i ask i'm asking
what's the mechanism
don't give me an analogy
tell me
well the delta variant and the alpha
variant
they have little fists
this would be the mechanism they have
little fists and when they meet each
other inside a body they start punching
and the delta variant punches harder so
it knocks out that other variant
and when it knocks it out it has sex
with it just before it dies and creates
yet another variant
now that would be a mechanism so that
would be describing in physical terms
how it is that the vaccination may
weaken that variant and then the other
one would beat it up with its little
fists
and take over
and have sex with it and then create
another variant
now that doesn't happen
but i'm looking for somebody to describe
physically
how a vaccination that works well on on
the alpha
could have any impact
on the delta
now the best that anybody's come up with
and it's only a few people
is that the delta wouldn't have any food
because people would get invec infected
with the other one
and then the delta would be oh i can't
go anywhere because everybody got
infected with the other one and that's
you know close enough so i can't i can't
get a foothold
but that's not the reason
there's there's still
so many people can get infected
including people who are vaccinated
that
both
every variant has plenty of food
and plenty of places to go so
my horse and rabbit analogy is pretty
close
you shouldn't make decisions on
analogies that that that's still true
but my analogy was to point out the
absurdity of the other analogies when
you heard my analogy and you said to
yourself well that's stupid because it
has nothing to do with viruses
that is the point the analogies are all
stupid and they have nothing to do with
viruses if you're thinking in terms of
an analogy
you don't know the mechanism
because the analogy doesn't tell you
well they have little fists
it just tells you something happened
analogously to something else no
mechanism noted
so
this is my current thinking
it might be true
that if
your vaccination works better on the
original virus it would suppress it more
and then the delta would there would be
more of them
is that is that a case of the
uh of it being caused
or did you just make one of them less
let's say you have a hundred jelly beans
that are red and 100 jelly beans that
are blue
and you eat all the red ones
did that promote the gross the growth of
blue ones
no
you just ate the red ones
so if the vaccination
eats all of the old virus you know the
original coronavirus
did it have any effect on the delta
no
it was just doing other things
as long as everybody has enough hosts
and food and that's the case because
vaccinated people still get both viruses
so there's plenty of hosts there's
plenty of food
every virus should grow as fast as it
wants to
i don't see how vaccinations make any
difference
scott is really reaching today so that's
a cognitive dissonance
actually let me read some of the
cognitive dissonance in the comments
i'll tell you how to add a
spot it
um it lowers the number of replicating
virus
what's your reason though what's the
mechanism
um
yes because the vaccine allows
asymptotes spread and people don't
realize it
that is not a reason
let's see if over on youtube
uh if both jelly beans are reproducing
the all of one color the other color
will have more of it
right
but it wasn't caused by anything
it was just two independent things
um
the vaccines are about profit but that
doesn't explain it
does anybody here see anything that
looks like pushback on my point
because i don't i haven't seen it yet
um
the receptors are blocked by the alpha
variant
the receptors are blocked so you're
telling me that if somebody gets the
alpha
then they can't get the variant
so basically you're saying that the
the original virus acts like a vaccine
against the variant
except that that only matters
if the variant doesn't have enough food
and it does
because the variant will spread whether
you're vaccinated or not
right
so as long as there's plenty of food
they're both going to spread anyway
that's my whole point
um
i saved it to the end so all of you can
bail out if you don't like that kind of
thinking
uh
scott we need to recommend where we
learn
about bitcoin and ethereum
um
where to learn about it so let's say you
have no knowledge whatsoever about
cryptocurrency
uh let me give you some knowledge right
now
well i could give you a micro lesson on
crypto
but maybe i should do that separately at
one point i did a micro lesson on crypto
and i'll probably do another one that's
a good idea
it's just survival of the fittest
somebody says any vaccine that doesn't
stop the spread entirely will allow
surviving virus to reproduce all right
now that's
definitely not right but thank you for
the ten dollar ten dollars to say it
do you understand that there's no such
thing as uh survival of the fittest
that that's
a hoax
not really a hoax but
how many people here think survival of
the fist is actually a scientific thing
it's not
when you were a kid it was
they thought that survival of the
fittest was actually how evolution works
but now we know it's not
yeah it's survival of the random there
is no survival of the fittest in the
biological animal
kingdom that's not a thing we used to
think it was yeah stephen j gould was
the
top biological scientist who who told us
that
so if your argument depends on survival
of the fittest
just know that it's it depends on
something that doesn't exist
and i would say that 90 percent of the
people who are looking at this virus
question
are saying well it's obvious survival of
the fittest just apply it to the virus
except survival of the fist doesn't
exist anywhere
so applying it to the virus takes
something that doesn't exist and you're
substituting the thing that doesn't
exist as your reasoning
natural selection
is
uh
basically randomness
um
how can we tell if we have a variant
apparently you can't tell if you get
tested there has to be some genetic
testing
um
you're applying a statistical tool to
individuals
okay
random selection yes it's random
selection
now how many people
so scott's a creationist
i'm a simulated world guy
so uh i don't know that we are a
simulation that that this reality is a
computer simulation but like elon musk i
agree that the math says it almost
certainly is so you don't know for sure
but almost certainly because the math
and statistics of it pretty much
guarantee it
it comes close to guaranteeing it
how many people
let me ask you this question how many
people who were watching this believed
that they understood evolution because
they knew what the survival of the
fittest was all about and just learned
that it's not a thing how many people
just learned that
will people with natural immunity be
forced to get yearly jabs
maybe
there's a good chance apparently the
pfizer booster is really good
so the booster doesn't just take you
back to where you were it takes you back
to many times better than if you only
had two in the first place
so the booster of the
uh of one of the shots i forget which
one was a j and j
it's just really
really useful
scott were you on prednisone when you
got your modern no i wasn't i was off
prednisone for over a year
um
yeah which booster was it j and j i
forget
it wasn't moderna
i think it was j j
uh never believed survival the fittest
otherwise dinosaurs would still be
around that's not true
because the
you know there were some environmental
things that killed the uh the dinosaurs
um
what are your opinions on steve bannon
well he's obviously
you know his his uh program his podcast
is very successful he makes a big dent i
would say he has a pretty big
pretty big
influence on me popular culture oh i
gotta run i'll see you guys later
