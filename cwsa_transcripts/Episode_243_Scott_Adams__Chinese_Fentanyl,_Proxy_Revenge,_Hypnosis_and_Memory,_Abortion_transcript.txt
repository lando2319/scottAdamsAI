hello joyce
hello susannah hey everybody
come on in here got lots of stuff to
talk about today
um before i start
uh i'm gonna have to mention this for a
few more days
just because uh to do otherwise would
feel dishonest
most of you know from yesterday that my
stepson died of a
fentanyl presumed fentanyl overdose
we know he had fentanyl in him uh
and i appreciate all of the condolences
and uh and good thoughts that people
sent me
by social media and otherwise but let's
talk about that
apparently the government's having a uh
hearing today about
chinese companies uh flooding the us
with counterfeit fentanyl
it seems that china might be the big
source for this illegal fentanyl
that finds itself in other drugs such as
counterfeit
xanax which may may have been a factor
in my stepson's death
um here's my feeling about this
if we know that china is the source
in my understanding which is still
sketchy so i may be wrong about this i
could use some fact checking
but my understanding is that fentanyl is
hard to make
in your bathtub and that you need you
need something like a legitimate
pharmaceutical company even if that
legitimate company
is doing illegitimate things once it
makes them
so it seems to me that if we know
china's the source
we might already know which
pharmaceutical companies
specifically are the source
now in china things are not so
clean as they might be in other places
because a ceo of a pharmaceutical
company
is likely to be connected to the
government
through family connections through money
connections etc
so it might it might not be as easy as
calling them out and asking for china to
do something because
it might be complicated but we know that
there's one thing china doesn't like
which is shame and so i'll be sending
china a whole bunch of shame
and they can they can do what they like
with that
my suggestion is that they identify the
perpetrators within their country and
execute them
[Music]
certainly execution is not too big a uh
too big a penalty for somebody who
might be responsible for up to thirty
thousand
deaths in the united states every year
thirty
thousand deaths in the united states
every year
what do you do to somebody who does that
execution
i think almost anybody would agree any
country you know you
you could if somebody kills 30 000
people
even in a country that doesn't have the
death penalty
you're still going to kill that guy um
one way or the other so if china doesn't
want to
um to get his house in order
and help solve this problem for us and i
realize there's demand in this country
etc
but i don't really care about that right
now uh right now i care that china stops
the problem
if they don't things are going to get
worse for china
i personally would not be in favor of
giving them any kind of a trade deal
until they fix this
you know there are a couple things that
china is doing
that they should just be shamed for
until it stops china doesn't like
to lose face and let me tell you
china you certainly lost a lot of face i
have to say that until this week i
actually respected china
but i've lost all respect now i've lost
all respect
for the chinese leadership because of
their inability to
control this continuous flow of
death to the united states and other
places i assume through this
this fentanyl now we don't know all the
facts so it's a little premature
it might not be that china's government
even knows what to do or who's doing it
but we should find that out
apparently the united states government
is confident enough
to state it as a fact and if our
government is stating it as a fact
we can't be 100 sure that's true but
i'm sure enough that now china needs to
answer for it
uh one way or the other so um you're
going to hear about this probably every
day for me for a while
uh if china doesn't do something about
the fentanyl problem
i favor our government solving it for
them
and by solving it for them i mean extra
legal
execution of chinese citizens
so let me say that as clearly as
possible
i'm favoring if the chinese government
can't handle their own problem
and with the problem seems to be that
pharmaceutical companies are creating
this
fake fentanyl and shipping it to the
united states
now that's not 100 confirmed in my
opinion
but assuming that that can be confirmed
and that china's government is unwilling
to deal with it
i would favor uh extra legal execution
of those of the people that we if we can
confirm that there's a
ceo or executives that are behind it
because keep in mind we're talking about
30 000 deaths in the united states
then that is somewhat directly
attributable
to this flow of fentanyl illegal
fentanyl
from china so execution is absolutely
um an appropriate and appropriate
solution if china won't do it first
so they can determine how much shame
they're willing to take
right now i have no respect for china
their their government has lost all
respect
and it's not coming back anytime soon
all right and if the governments are
unwilling to take care of that
i would request that our government
once it's once it's reached a degree of
certainty about who the problem is
in china i would like to see the names
of those people
i'd like to see a picture and a
photograph
of the chinese executives that we're
specifically blaming for this
because they need to be on the front
page of every
every newspaper every website
consider this if a mass killer
killed a hundred people what would the
media do
they would put them the face and the
name of that killer
for just a hundred people if somebody
killed a hundred people
their name and their face you know
stephen paddock for example
would be famous all over the world there
are apparently allegedly not confirmed
but i think we're heading toward
confirming it some chinese executives
who may be killing
thirty thousand americans a year and
know it
and are completely aware of it i want
their names
and i want their faces and i want any
google search
that involves these people and if
they're executives they're
probably somewhat high visibility
i would like their family name to be the
subject of a google search
so that they could be known as mass
killers
now if that's not enough to take them
out i don't know what will
but to our government and uh for those
of you who are not aware of this
there there are a number of people at
high levels in
the white house who do sample this
this this periscope so
i know for sure that this message got to
where it needed to go
i don't mean the president but within
the white house
within the administration these the
suggestion
that we have an absolute right
to know the names and see the faces
of the people accused of killing thirty
thousand americans a year
now the thirty thousand is my own
estimate based on the fact that there
are
seventy two thousand deaths from
overdose
the greatest percentage of those by far
is fentanyl
and the greatest source of that comes
from china so i'm
interpolating a little bit connecting
some dots but
in a fair way whether that number is
twenty thousand or fifty thousand i
don't know
but i'm gonna say thirty thousand just
to keep it simple
so government of the united states
as a taxpayer as a citizen
and as a supporter of this
administration
i'm asking you directly because i know
this message will go through one way or
the other
i'd like to see the name names
and faces of the chinese executives if
you know them
and if you're sure if you're not sure
then absolutely don't
but if we reach a level of certainty i
deserve
to know the name and the face of who
killed my stepson
if you can do it all right enough on
that let's go to some stuff that's a
little more
interesting maybe not more interesting
but
less less less of a downer
so there's a story about
kavanaugh accuser christine ford that
she wrote a paper she was co-author of a
paper
that involved the topics of hypnosis and
memory
and in that paper apparently it says
claims correctly it claims
that the hypnosis
can pollute memories so
now we have entered into fact
that christine ford who claims she has a
hundred percent
um accurate memory of an event
involving brett kavanaugh who
let's call him judge kavanaugh does not
remember and believes it did not exist
and we know that she had traumatic
experiences
and we know that she co-authored a paper
about the benefits of hypnosis
for uh traumatic experiences
so here's the stuff we know and i'm
gonna make sure that
it's as clear as possible what we don't
know
what we don't know is that christine
ford
has ever been hypnotized there's no
evidence of that right
so i want to be as clear as possible
zero evidence of that
that i am aware of anyway but certainly
worth asking
if if you're the fbi anybody involved
with the fbi is listening
that is a question that you need to ask
and i hope that
that does so uh self-hypnosis by the way
would not
um would not be the same kind of memory
altering
significance as being hypnotized from
another person
self-hypnosis is almost entirely about
relaxing and visualizing there are no
external suggestions coming in with that
process
so self-hypnosis don't think of that as
a memory polluter
although i imagine in some you know
there might be some way that's true
but it's not a demonstrated effect the
demonstrated effect
is somebody else hypnotizing somebody
can introduce
suggestions even accidentally so
again summary of what's in evidence we
know that she had a traumatic
she had trauma and she she says she
she was suffering from ptsd
and claustrophobia
and anxiety and some other things and we
know that she wrote a paper saying that
hypnosis
could be useful for treating those
things and we know that she
understands because she co-wrote the
paper that hypnosis can pollute memories
so we have no evidence that she was ever
hypnotized so we can't take that
and and say therefore x that's the sort
of a
you know stranded knowledge it doesn't
really connect to the case
unless she was hypnotized so the
fbi should absolutely ask that question
um but without that information it would
not be fair to us to speculate that she
did because it's not
it's not in record all we know is that
she had a
extraordinarily high she had an
extraordinarily high
incentive to be hypnotized she had
access to people who could do it and she
understanded
that it would benefit her
that's all we know we don't know she
actually did it
now you may be wondering um
can people forget things under hypnosis
so somebody asked me online can you
hypnotize somebody
to forget something and my answer is
i've never seen it happen
in movies people forget that they've
been hypnotized they you know i didn't
know i was hypnotized i thought i was
just doing my thing
but in reality although i've heard of it
happening
i've never witnessed it in any hypnosis
experience that i've either
administered or observed or heard of
directly
so i can't confirm that but i also can't
deny it either i just
it would be rare in my opinion for
somebody to have hypnosis induced
amnesia
it would not be rare to have
hypnosis-induced
memory changes that's actually common
and if you don't understand that it's
common then you don't understand the
context of this situation
i think it's time to pause for the
simultaneous sip
i've given you all enough time to grab
your beverage
your cup your chalice your mug
fill it with your favorite beverage and
join me please
ah so this next question i think
is interesting which is what is the
standard
of suspicion that should apply to this
kavanaugh case
so we're seeing you know almost nobody
involved in the discussion of kavanaugh
and ford
is even attempting to be unbiased or
fair about it because people are too
invested
i'm positive that that effect you know
influences me as well but i'll at least
make an attempt
to be as fair as possible those people
saying that the
legal standard for guilt has not been
demonstrated for kavanaugh and therefore
he should be fined
that's ridiculous right because it's not
a legal
it's not a legal situation people look
at
um the the prosecutor
i forget her name who was asked to uh
to work for the republicans in
questioning christine ford
she did a write up after the fact now
remember she was just a hired
hired gun so she did a write up after
the fact and to
fill out the context she said that if
this were a
a legal case it would not rise to the
level that you would pursue it
there's not enough there and she also
said that you wouldn't even pursue it
if it was a civil case which has a lower
standard of evidence
a criminal case has to be guilty beyond
reasonable doubt a civil case
has to be more likely guilty than not
it's sort of a preponderance of evidence
situation so she said that rachel
mitchell is her name
so the prosecutor rachel mitchell said
that
you've not reached the highest level
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but
you've also
not reached the lowest level under the
law which is that preponderance
you know more likely true state
but this was never a legal competition
i find it interesting context because if
she had said the opposite it would be
news right
if she had said oh yeah if this had been
a legal case
it definitely would have been proven you
know with
both standards of one of those standards
so the fact she says
it's not that high a standard
tells you where it is and that's useful
it doesn't tell you he should be hired
because the job applicant standard
is entirely different all right but the
question is
what is the standard for hiring
so for example let's say you had just
somebody coming to your office
and they apply for a job and you know
that there's a rumor about them
and you assess that there's a 10 chance
it's true
that this person did some heinous crime
let's say it was a sex crime
would you hire an employee who had a 10
chance that they might be a rapist
probably not probably not right
you would not hire somebody if you could
hire other people
you know you had an option you wouldn't
hire anybody who had a 10
chance of being a rapist right would you
have a
would you hire somebody who had a 10
chance of
having done something bad but you don't
think they'll do it again
you know would you hire somebody who was
like 10 likely to have been guilty of a
sex crime but
probably won't do it again
a lot of people say yes a lot of people
say no
so the question is who gets to set the
standard
personally would i hire somebody who is
ten percent likely to have committed a
crime that seems like the sort of crime
that would influence
influence them in the in the in the
present
because in this case in kavanaugh's case
it's easy to imagine he would be asked
to judge
a question that that was in this this
realm
you know a question about assault or
claims of assault or
legal standards for assault something
like that you can imagine it happening
so if you if this were if this
were just a job interview
i would be on the side of not hiring
kavanaugh
so i'll say that again because there are
so few people who are willing
to be or at least attempt to be unbiased
um and i'm not sure i'm succeeding at
that but
since this opinion goes against the
grain i'll say it again
and as clearly as possible if this were
a normal job interview
i would say that the odds of
kavanaugh having some issues are you
know maybe 10
if i thought they were 10 i'd say no
let's look at somebody else 10
is too high why would we take a chance
if you have other qualified judges why
would you take a chance on 10
but this is not normal
this is not a normal job interview this
is a situation
in which there are big themes being
tested they're big
themes about what kind of civilization
we want to be
so it's a job interview but on top of
that are far bigger issues
and the far bigger issues are can we
change politics in this way permanently
does will everybody be judged on what
they did
as a minor
will everyone be judged whether they had
some drinks
in the past whether they drank too much
in the past
will we be parsing the difference
between black out drunk
and drinking and then going to sleep at
night because people go to sleep at
night
will we will we accept as a standard
that uh an un un let's say a
people are using the word corroborated
in two different ways to prove their
point
you've noticed this right the people who
want kavanaugh to get appointed
they say there's no corroboration
because they're using it in more a
technical sense
as in another direct witness or physical
evidence
the uh the people who are saying it is
corroborated
are using the word in a whole different
standard which is is there any other
information that would lead you to
believe this could be true that's
far from corroboration in a legal sense
but it's not a legal case
it's sort of a job interview with larger
themes on top
so let me break this down for you given
that there are the larger themes about
how do we want to judge people in
general
how do we want to run politics how do we
want to treat each other what level of
suspicion
is good enough to derail somebody when
something is naked
politics how much do we give it weight
and how much do we dismiss it because
it's so nakedly
political and here's what it comes down
to and i've heard
i've heard nobody say this
why are you going to hear me say i think
will be the most objective thing you've
heard on this topic
and it should make you mad that you
haven't heard it from now
the decision on kavanaugh comes down to
this
would you accept a 10 chance that he did
the deed
would you accept that if you knew it was
true
but you also had to accept that you've
permanently destroyed
a key tenet of civilization which is
you know innocent until proven guilty
now the as other people have said who
are smarter than me
it's not a legal case so we don't have
the technical
legal requirement of innocent until
proven guilty that's not a thing
for this situation but it is also
generally accepted that we would act
that way by analogy somebody said
for other situations in other words when
you're hiring somebody if they're
accused of something
and there is no proof that it would be
good
social process to act like you don't
know anything because you don't
your your suspicions should not be
enough to derail somebody's life
so here's the thing i don't know what
percentage
likelihood of kavanaugh having done the
the deed
you want to put on that but would you
accept
a candidate with i'll just say 10
percent as a
you know just for my example would you
accept a candidate who had a 10
chance of having groped somebody
while drunken at 17 years old
and then lived a what seems to be an
exemplary life since then
would you accept that situation that
risk and that
problem to retain
a key tenant probably several key
tenants
of civilization you know the glue that
holds us all together
that that innocent until we really know
you're a guilty thing
whether it's a legal context or just the
way you treat people
is essentially the the underpinning of
let's just say everything we care about
pretty much everything we care about
comes down to that
why do i um if you're a black man and
you come in
for a job let's say i'm hiring
you're a black man you come in for a job
if i say to myself
well there's nothing to make me suspect
this particular applicant has any
problem
but there are other black people
who have committed crimes so if i have
some suspicion
in this in this scenario you imagine
that i've got racial
racial biases
if i suspect there's a one percent
chance
that because this person is black and i
know that the
crime rate of black people is higher
than other groups
can i say you know in a normal situation
there's no evidence about this candidate
this candidate has an exemplary record
but i still have this suspicion i still
i still i'm worried that there's
something there
the kavanaugh case gives you permission
to not hire that person
if you couldn't get away with it legally
the kavanaugh
situation says you don't need to know
somebody's guilty
you just have to be worried about it
is that enough the glue of civilization
will fall apart
if we can destroy a man because there
might be a problem
there might be don't know
um how about the
how about destroying somebody for
trivial
lies in the case of kavanaugh he's
accused of being a liar
about the amount he drank in high school
which probably would extend to college
and he's accused of lying about the
meaning of some words in his high school
yearbook
let's say he did lie let's say he did
about unimportant things that happened
when he was a teenager
should that be disqualifying some let's
say
it's a job interview at your company guy
comes in for a job interview and you say
you know
i want to really know about your
character before i hire you for this job
have you uh have you ever had alcohol
and the applicant says yeah i've had
alcohol
i i am a social drinker ah you're a
social drinker
did you ever drink enough to be
considered
drunk and the candidate says um
yeah yeah i mean i've had few too many a
few times
um is that it you know it was when i was
17.
is that it is the interview done what if
the
what if the uh then you say okay but
have you ever been
so drunk you couldn't remember what you
did
what is the job and what does the job
applicant say to that
have you ever been so drunk that you
didn't remember what you did
first of all stupid question because
everybody who's been pretty drunk has
memory lapses it's pretty much 100
certain that somebody who is drinking
has some memory lapses
what does that job apple can do well
they probably lie right it's like no
i've never been that drunk that i
couldn't remember what i did
so if the person says that do you just
say get out of my office
because there's a very high chance that
you're lying to me right now
i don't know for sure but if you're
telling me that you like to drink
you drank until you were drunk you had
drinks in high school
and you're telling me now that you don't
that you can be sure
you don't remember you can be sure you
remember everything
when you were 17 and drunk get out of my
office
you were declined for the job that is
insane
[Music]
so let's be clear about what we're
dealing with here we're dealing with
taking
an x percent chance that somebody did
something when they were 17
that would be heinous if it was true
maybe a 10 chance but we also know that
none of that has happened
as he has become the person that he is
now so
if it happened 17 year old kavanaugh
is very much a different entity than
adult kavanaugh
do you accept that in return for
unraveling
one of the key threads that keeps
civilization together
my prediction is no way in l
my prediction is that however however
long
it takes civilization will not give up
a primary you know
building block a foundational piece
um if it does we're all in big trouble
but i don't think that's going to happen
um somebody pointed me to a piece by
victor david hanson talking about how
you know
things like this situation the kavanaugh
situation and other situations he
mentions
are suggesting that civilization is in
big trouble we're in big trouble
things are falling apart my god things
have never been this bad
i say baloney
there are definitely things that are bad
and you know
one of them from the beginning of this
this periscope
but it is also unambiguously true that
we're
better than we've ever been and let me
tell you
if the thing we're arguing about is what
brett kavanaugh did when he was 17.
if that's if that's the biggest problem
in the news
and apparently it is we are in really
good shape
you know just take take a moment take a
breath take a deep breath
just step back from this for a moment
and imagine you're looking at it like an
observer
and you can and you're an observer who
can go back and forth in time so you're
a
time traveling observer and you go back
to the you know
mid 1940s and there's like a world war
you look at the 60s there's you know
marching the streets then you've got
you know aids out of control and you've
got nuclear
proliferation and maybe we're all going
to die and then you fast forward
to 2018 and you look at the headlines
and we're talking about what a supreme
court nominee
did in high school
just think about it it's
pretty much the entire headlines for
this week are what a supreme court
nominee
who by the way everyone
assume he seems to be widely considered
highly
qualified and a good person in his
current
you know age and situation
but if that's what we're talking about
we're in good shape
let's talk about something else here's
what's missing from the discussion about
kavanaugh that
signals that it's an illegitimate
um debate now i think you all
already know it's an illegitimate debate
it's just it's
people lining up by political parties
and
and ideology that that mark that much is
obvious
but here's what's missing from the
debate so here's another
the dog that didn't bark how many of you
know
what happens if the supreme court
overturns
roe versus wage how many of you know
what happens
because i feel like the public believes
that that means that
abortion would be illegal my
understanding
subject to fact checking is that if the
supreme court
boots it all that means is that the
federal government gets out of the
business of saying what's legal and
illegal
on abortion and that that goes to the
states
now if we were in the past at around the
time of roe v
wade having the government get
the federal government get out of the
abortion business
would mean that it would mostly be
illegal because the states would want it
illegal too but now it's 2018.
how many of the states would make it
illegal
and the answer is some i assume
california wouldn't so they so where i
live
there would be no change the biggest
democratic states
would experience no change because their
states
their states wouldn't have a chance of
making it illegal not a chance
so you would have a country in which
there were states that don't want it to
be legal by a majority and they
maybe wouldn't have it and states that
want it to be legal by majority and they
would have it
and people can move states moreover
people in the states where it's illegal
will certainly 100 chance
find strategies to go to a neighboring
state
and and get it done there may be crowd
funding
there may be charities that help the
travel
but probably abortion will be legal and
safe
and widely available available it
probably will get harder
for some states and some situations but
i'm reasonably sure that the
the folks who are pro
pro choice i guess that those folks will
figure out the system to get the people
who are in the states where it can't be
done
temporarily to the states where it can
be done
uh maybe some extra funding maybe it's
maybe it's just
you can stay at my house you know maybe
if you're a
pro-choice advocate you have an app and
you say look
if you're in a state where you can't get
one done i live next to a clinic
and i will let you stay in my room while
you're traveling
and then maybe somebody else can help
pay for the transportation or something
but i believe that the net
outcome of any change in roe v wade at
the supreme court
would end up being a far smaller change
than the news is reporting
i can't tell you who told me that first
i wish i could
i wish i could tell you where i learned
what i just learned
but i will tell you to trust me that
very smart people are thinking the same
thing
um and
why don't you see that reported on the
news ask yourself this
have you seen any news report that
reported
which states were likely to
keep abortion rights just the way they
are and which ones are likely to change
have you seen that report because if you
haven't seen that report
you are being manipulated or at least
poorly served
by the news because it's the biggest
question
abortion is really the only thing behind
the kavanaugh thing i mean if you come
down to it
you know people will argue with other
things too but it's kind of abortion
right it's kind of down to roe v wade
has your news source
informed you what would happen if roe v
wade is overturned
they have not they have not attempted to
inform you
now if they had tried and done and they
hadn't done a good job
well then i would say well they're
trying to inform you of the right stuff
but there is no attempt there is no
attempt to show you what would happen i
would say that fox news doesn't want to
show you that
i would say the cnn doesn't want to show
you that msnbc doesn't want to show you
that
as far as i know there's nobody who is a
news source
who is independent enough to show you
the news
and the news is what will happen if it
gets overturned because if you don't
know that
you do not have an informed opinion on
this topic
now i think it would be fair if you said
to yourself anything that or you know
chews away at the right i'm gonna i'm
gonna fight with every
you know ounce of my body and i think
that would be that would be a
supportable opinion
but um it's it's unforgivable that we
don't have the raw information about
what the states would do
all right let's talk about something
else please if you were
if you were defending kavanaugh please
please dear god
stop saying that when people say they
don't have a memory
of something that they're confirming it
didn't happen
please stop saying that because it's
just embarrassing
now i know that you know it and i'm
talking about all of the
pretty much all of the top pundits on
the major networks and stuff
it is not true that not having a memory
of something that happened
35 years ago is the same as saying
something didn't happen they're just not
the same
and every time we act like they are it
just makes us
look like idiots
let's talk about
temperament so you you've seen that the
news is going after
or the uh the kavanaugh haters are going
after him for having the wrong
temperament you know saturday night live
made fun of it etc and of course it's
ridiculous
to say that because anybody in that
situation
has certainly has my permission to get
as mad as they want to be
that has nothing to do with what he
would do if he's ruling on a
you know as if accusing
so the people on the left have made it
seem like
accusing somebody in public of being a
sex offender
is exactly the same as the same
emotional state for the judge
as if he's deciding on some you know
technical legal matter which is the work
of the supreme court
i don't think there's any chance that
kavanaugh has a temperament that doesn't
work as a judge
why do i say that because he's a
freaking judge he's been a judge for a
long time
i think we'd figure out if his
temperament was a problem on
in his judgeship that would certainly be
obvious by now
somebody would have mentioned it but
that's not my point
my point is this let us not
pretend that the temperament insult is
anything but an
anti-male attack
just like when and i said this yesterday
just like when
men or even women call women hysterical
that's sort of a female specific word
and is considered sexist and i agree
with that characterization
but would you agree with me that women
don't get accused
of having a bad temperament it's because
men are big and scary
and and too often rapists and dangerous
that temperament is even on the table
because if
a you know hundred pound woman has a bad
temperament nobody even cares
nobody even cares because they can't
hurt you
but if he has a bad temperament we're
not really talking about his
judging that's not the problem here is
it
the problem is he's large he's male
and he might have a lot you know a
temperament
issue that's really just sexism
because he in particular has no evidence
that his temperament has been
an issue all right um
mike cernovich uh has reported on
twitter and by the way
mike um if you're watching this thank
you for your
for your thoughts on twitter um
but mike cernovich noted that not only
did
christine ford's social media profiles
not only did they get scrubbed before
all this came out
but apparently even basic google
searches
um are turning up empty in ways that
they wouldn't
so i don't have the details on this but
i know mike
generally mike cervich generally does so
i'm going to trust that he that his
information is accurate
in the sense that there's something
unusual about how deeply she got
scrubbed
now let's put some let's put some facts
together
so christine ford is engaged in a highly
political
thing and this highly political thing
would have impact even on the midterms i
think everybody would agree whichever
way it goes
is going to have a huge impact on how
people vote
she has claimed that she put in a second
front
door to host google interns because
google is right
right close to them so we know that
christine ford
has a google connection indeed google
google interns living in her home or
interacting in his home and she has a
political
she's in a political situation and there
is credible allegations
credible allegations credible
allegations
that she her internet presence was
scrubbed in a way
that only somebody like google could do
now is that enough
information to say that the fbi should
extend
their um extend their
investigation to find out whether google
scrubbed her uh her her history because
if google did scrub her history
google is interfering with the election
and i would say that that would be jail
time for some people probably
so i think we have to at least put on
the table
uh that the fbi
should be investigating google because
of this situation
there's there's enough in there's enough
let's say
suspicion based on the facts
that looking into this google link with
uh christine ford given that we know
google's political leanings
we know that we have good evidence that
her
deep history was scrubbed in a way that
only a google
could do i would say there's plenty of
evidence there
to suggest an fbi probe and if they
probe
the fbi is free to ask any question
right
because we know that once the fbi gets
in and once you're the subject of the
probe
they can ask any question and i think we
should find out
if google is illegally
interfering with american elections
is that not fair by the way does anybody
think that isn't fair
to me that seems completely fair
all right
and i think oh
uh there's speaking of fair there is a
professor named
christine fair you may have seen she was
recently booted off of the twitter but
not before she tweeted that
uh what did she tweet let me read it to
you
i think i have that handy all right
uh damn it
i thought i had that i do not
but anyway she tweeted something hateful
about entitled white men
and uh they should be castrated and
blah blah and the the shocking thing is
not
not that she got kicked off of twitter
that was perfectly appropriate
um the shocking thing is not that one
person had an opinion
here's the shocking thing the shocking
thing
is that she thought it was okay to say
that
so in order for christine fair who got
kicked off of twitter
in order for her to say the hateful
things she did about
white men she had to think that
that that was a common enough thought
that it would be safe for her to say it
in public
that's the scary part yeah she said that
white men maybe should be castrated and
fed to swine so she suggested that
yeah tortured and killed and castrated
and fed to swine
their testicles so
think about how far things have gone
that that thought
didn't seem like an inappropriate
thought we've actually gotten to the
point
where killing and um yeah
killing and castrating white men feels
like something you can say
in public like uh how about that
uh
all right i think i've got enough
that's enough for today and i'm going to
talk to you tomorrow
and every day for a while now i'm going
to remind china
china uh
we're coming for you we're gonna come
for you hard
so get ready china
