do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
if you'd like your experience today
to go to levels that nobody can even
imagine all you need is a cover a mug or
a glass take your Chelsea style the
canteen jerk of flaska vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go
ah pause to saber save her favorite
okay
well as you know uh Joe Biden's dog
whose name is Commander
uh has been biting people mostly the
Secret Service
and we can only spank it late as why
uh my assumption is that a commander is
a Republican and he's trying to get the
secret service to quit so the body was
more exposed
that's one Theory the other possibility
is that uh
if your name is uh Commander Biden
you're probably going to do some Biden
and Joe Biden
Joe Biden and Commander Biden
um but you might ask if the dog is
biting people repeatedly oh why do they
keep it around
isn't it obvious
it's obvious why they keep it around
right
it's going to be real the replacement
for Kamala Harris yeah commander of the
dog will be uh vice presidential running
mate
because unlike Kamal Harris that that
dog gets things done if you know what I
mean
nobody's ever going to say his bite is
worse than his bark because his
or his bark is worse than his bike
because his bite is worse than the spark
all right
here's the good news that looks like bad
news
I've said a number of times and I think
it was Mark Twain who said it first that
we humans can't tell the difference
between good news and bad news
you've probably heard me say that I feel
like this is one of those times
because would you agree with the
following statement that the fabric of
civilization is coming apart
who would agree with that statement it
isn't just like there are a few problems
it's like the very fabric
of civilization
is at risk right
here's my positive take
everything was broken
everything was broken
every one of our systems were corrupt
and are corrupt
everything that should work isn't
working
but we were still limping along
I believe we've entered what I'm going
to call the demolition phase
we're just going to break all of our
because we're really bad at stopping
things
would you agree that's a sort of a
American feature we're not great at
discontinuing what we were doing we
might be better than some other
countries that doing it but we're not
where we need to be we'll write a bad
idea what's far too long
but here's what we're good at
we're really good at rebuilding
we're really good at the next phase
after the demolition phase and I'm going
to talk about that all the stories are
really the same story we're in just
demolition phase just breaking
everything
and
the good news is that Americans in
particular
are really really good at the creative
stuff
if we break this how are we going to fix
it or build something better design
something better we're entering we're
leaving the phase we're terrible at
which is changing things that are sort
of ossified and you know frozen into our
structure
but we're going to get that done
and you're seeing the first signs of it
for sure
but we're about to enter
the greater phase and we're really good
at that
there's going to be a lot of fun coming
all right here's a few things uh just to
update you I did talk to uh Russell
Brand uh yesterday
we had scheduled for 30 minutes but we
went 90 minutes because we're just
having fun and I think you'll see that
around Thursday maybe the probably
clipped up so it might be caught up in a
few different pieces
um
but would you say that Russell Brand in
his situation and my situation in Tucker
Carlson's situation and a number of
other situations would you say that we
were all destroyed
now we're not dead
but wouldn't you say that our business
models were all destroyed
yeah same with Trump
Trump was destroyed
but he's still here
and what did I do when I got canceled
that was my demolition
so I had somewhat instant demolition it
was sort of like the the dynamite took
it down all at once what did I do as
soon as I was canceled
as soon as the demolition phase was over
I entered the creative phase
how'd that go
excellent really because I'm way better
at creating than I am at destroying
so I had reached a certain age and said
you know I'd really love to destroy what
I already have
because I'm I just feel stuck I didn't
feel like I could retire in any normal
way but I wanted to I wanted to just do
things I wanted to do I wanted to take
some more chances do something different
and then the demolition phase happened
you know without my expectation
and so I've never been happier and I
know people don't believe that but you
have to understand what it feels like to
be a creative person who's already made
their money
the the already making your money Parts
important to the story but if you're
creative by Nature and you haven't been
creative for a decade or more because
you're you're coloring between the lines
and you didn't want to get in trouble
and you're in the newspaper and they
don't they don't take uh they don't
allow you to have much Edge
so I've been delighted it's been great
I've never been creatively more
fulfilled
so
what will happen to Russell Brand well
assuming that he recovers and I believe
he will he'll probably be a different
creature
so his creativity will have to kick in
uh you saw what happened with Tucker
Carlson
as soon as his business model evaporated
not his choosing he got creative and he
looked at he looked at what assets he
had to work with and then he assembled
the assets
and they put on the biggest show of all
time
like I I don't know it is there has
anything ever gotten bigger ratings in
the sort of news category
maybe the 1969 moon landing that was
about it so watch for this pattern
demolition followed by creativity it's
what we do best here in America
you want another example
I saw a certificate tweet about
he was talking about uh there's a tech
Fair a career one of these job fairs and
it was limited to women
but it was filled with men do you know
why it was filled with men
even though it was designed to be just
for women
because the men showed up and they
identified as non-binary
lots of them
lots of young men
showed up at the woman's only job fair
identified as non-binary
and were allowed in
can we take a moment
[Applause]
that's how you do it
that's how you do it
why did the young men
have to do that
well because the structure that would
normally support them in the free market
had been ossified and destroyed
right their old system of doing things
was demolished
so what did they do
they're Americans
they're men
they're young
they got creative
and they said
 you
 you
 you you and you
wrote non-binary on their label and went
in and tried to get themselves some jobs
yeah
do you think there'll be less of that in
the future
no no no
young men
it's time
we My Generation has failed you
completely
I I don't mind saying that it's just
true we have failed you completely we
let this walk get out of
control do you know why because it
didn't affect us that much
that's why
it didn't affect me that much
because I already made my money and that
was a certain age but we you
young guys especially young women as
well by young guys I think worse
and you know what you're gonna have to
do it yourself
and guess what
you're going to do it yourself
and you will succeed
because nothing's going to stop you
you're not gonna you're not going to put
up with this
like we did
it's time
so you were well into the demolition
phase young men it is time for you to
destroy the systems that are holding you
back and I know you will
uh as Mike certavich recommended if
you're not doing this meaning
identifying as something that would have
some rights in America if you're not
doing this or telling your kids to do
this on college applications you
shouldn't read me meaning you shouldn't
follow certavich as you lack the vision
and it will that it takes to return this
country to some baseline normalcy
ah
there there's a reason why cernovich
gets so much attention everything he
writes
is spicy like you start reading it and
suddenly your mouth is on fire
before he gets to the end of the
sentence
but I would uh I'm piling on to that the
thought because it's a good one and I
think it's time for 100 of young white
males to identify as Native American and
non-binary
why Native American and non-binary well
the non-binary gets you all the you know
gender related stuff and the Native
American gets you all these scholarships
and access to college and stuff but
here's why I like Native American and
non-binary
as opposed to everybody freelancing you
know somebody's saying oh I'm I'm
Hispanic and lesbian or something don't
do that do you know why you should say
you're Native American and non-binary
because you're signaling it's
right your signaling as clearly as you
can that you're lying
right in front of them
so that's how you break the system
don't be clever
you don't have to be clever just go full
Elizabeth Warren and non-binary and who
can prove otherwise what are they going
to do test your DNA
that's probably coming but I would uh
definitely I would definitely push on
that a little bit Yeah I'd push on that
because once you start measuring
everybody's DNA
um there's trouble
all right but young men will lead us out
and I think it's going to start soon
basically if you follow the money
you could predict this right you're
you're a young white man
and what are you going to do if you want
to make money
follow the money you suggest that all
white men will see other white men
getting away with it and they will all
have to do it
'll just be a requirement for Success so
I would think that that's very
predictable that the white men will
destroy the system of racial and gender
preferences by simply assigning
themselves those genders and those and
those races
and nobody can stop them because those
are the rules that somebody else made
not them they didn't make the rules that
you can you can assign yourself any
gender
or race you want that's their their
rules
all right some news out of uh Lahaina
and Maui it's uh I think fake news
but you wouldn't know it unless I told
you I've got some Insider information
here
so the residents from uh let's see the
West Maui
are resisting the governor's
push to reopen for tourists
now as you might imagine the hotels want
the tourists to come in but there are a
number of the locals especially locals
who work in the industry the service
industry
a bartender is quoted uh paella
he told the news conference that locals
quote are not mentally nor emotionally
ready to welcome and serve our visitors
does that sound like quite legit
do you think that people who have not
worked for months
even though they're getting paid I think
the payments may stop after a while but
do you think that they really don't want
to go back to work
let me tell you what's really happening
over there and you won't read this in
the news
most of the residents of Lahaina
especially ones who worked in the in the
Food Services or restaurants industry
they were not winning in life
they were not living in mansions
they were not living in splendor
when their homes burned down and they
became completely homeless
the the government to its credit moved
in FEMA Etc and they moved him into
in most cases hotels
or you know large luxury places now
they're not living like tourists you
know I think they get their meals are
cooked on the beach in mass and stuff
like that so they're not living like
tourists but they are living in a style
to which they've never been accustomed
before
they're getting their food
um and they're getting housing that's
better than they've ever had
and they're not working
so do you think it's because the reason
they don't want to go back to work is
because they're quote not mentally nor
emotionally ready to welcome and serve
our visitors
or do you think as the locals have
been telling other people
that there is a strong preference for
milking this thing as long as possible
which do you think it is they want to
milk it as long as possible
or that they are not mentally nor
emotionally ready to welcome and serve
our visitors
well I think you know the answer to that
yeah so there's milking it do you think
the news will report that
I only know it because I've heard it
from locals indirectly
yeah
so that's the big problem but they're
not going to say that out loud I don't
think all right there's a study big
study well not bad study not that big
but in Jama
Journal of American Medicals something
something and
it showed that loneliness affects your
health apparently we knew that
loneliness
caused higher morbidity
in a number of neural
neuro degenerative diseases but
apparently now they've got some pretty
good ideas that loneliness could affect
your mental health your ability to get
Parkinson's I'm sorry Parkinson's so
loneliness seems to be
a cause of various diseases including
Parkinson's so does that track
does that make sense to you
do you believe that loneliness is that
debilitating
I do
I do yeah to me that sounds somewhat
obvious you know the the science I
believe I've told you this before the
science I believe is when the science
agrees with not only other science as
this one does
but it also agrees with observation
I would say that when I feel lonely I
also feel less healthy
like you can really feels like a like
just a weight on your whole soul
yeah I I would be amazed if it doesn't
affect your health
so I'm going to say I believe that one
all right here's another science uh they
tested to see if heterosexual men
uh can identify women who are
um fertile
meaning fertile at that moment that they
could have a baby at that moment if they
were impregnated then
and sure enough it was a smallish study
but sure enough men could identify women
who were fertile
now do you believe that
because we've known for a while oh and
they also are not conscious of it
they're not conscious of it
so it's an unconscious identification is
what the study somehow was
somehow was designed to tease out it's
an unconscious thing
and
so what does that say about birth
control
wouldn't this tell you that if you were
on let's say the pill
that you would not present as fertile
and therefore would you not be less
attractive to your partner
for about half of the month
is that a thing
doesn't that make sense if if the normal
way of things without birth control is
that uh let's say your mate is more
attractive to you than normal during
those fertile weeks
don't you think you would have a much
happier marriage than if your attraction
was the birth control attraction which
would be lower
all the time so you would never have two
weeks where you're just like really into
your partner you're not sure why or more
importantly your partner is really into
you do you think it only works one way
do you think that the reason that the
only mechanism is that the men are more
attractive you don't think the women who
are fertile
are also more flirty and more willing
and
you know more orgasmic and More
Everything of course they are
I mean logically you'd think so
so it seems to me that birth control
probably destroyed marriage
which would also destroy reproduction
which would be the end of humankind
but because it comes from Big Pharma
and women really really like it I
understand why
um nothing will happen
so we'll never take this seriously
because it's big Pharma and women like
it and I can see why you know getting
pregnant when you don't want to get
pregnant pretty bad deal
all right
um
have you ever heard this the experts on
relationships talk about we will talk
about Matt Gates By the way we'll get
there
um
there are two kinds of uh emotional
let's say attachment styles
tell me if you've heard this it's kind
of popular at the moment
and that these attachment styles are
formed early in life you know usually
something with you and your parents I
guess and there are two primary Styles
attachment anxiety and attachment
avoidance
have you ever heard of this
and that people have attachment anxiety
they seek reassurance and closeness in
their relationships well those with
attachment avoidance tend to be
uncomfortable with intimacy and desire
Independence
and then there's a whole you know a
whole bunch of advice based on this
breakup
I don't believe any of this
to me this looks like complete
it looks to me like Myers-Briggs
and Myers-Briggs has been proven not to
have any useful value now I say that
knowing that the Myers-Briggs people
disagree so to avoid getting sued
let me say it's my opinion that
Myers-Briggs is I'm sure they
would tell you it's not
so just be aware that there's a counter
argument
but to me this whole uh we can do
something to help your relationship if
we just figure out this attachment
anxiety Thing versus you know the
attachment avoidance thing I don't think
any of it is real
that that's my take
so I don't believe uh Myers-Briggs I
don't believe this attachment anxiety
avoidance thing is real
and I also don't think that the five
languages of love
is what you think it is do you know that
theory that everybody has their own love
language some people have a love
language which is they like gifts
or acts of service you do something for
them other people like kind words
and other people like touch
physical touch I think there's one more
I can't remember
and if you knew other people's love
language that would allow you to respond
to them in their love language and
therefore everybody's happier right
complete
it's just a scam
here's the scam have you ever asked a
woman what her love language is
do they ever say touch
no
no no no no because they can get touched
anytime they want
touch has no value to them if you ask a
man what his love language is is very
likely to say touch
do you know why
because he's a man it's hard it's hard
to get touched
if you're a man
right so it has everything to do with
you know the economics of it you know
what is the thing that's hard for you to
get it's not your love language
it's just what's hard to get
that's it and you ask women what their
love language is if you've ever tried
this and what do they say gifts and acts
of service you
 you good try ladies yeah if we give
you and act like you're Butler
you'll like us a little more oh surprise
I'm glad I did some science to figure
that out something that everybody in the
old world already knew
this is useless
that's my take
all right
um Elon Musk has a term that I'm going
to adopt he did a tweet yesterday which
I call a post
in which he said I almost never read
Legacy news anymore
what's the point of reading a thousand
words about something that was already
posted on X several days ago
now I believe I said something very
similar
and years ago I heard that Mark Cuban
say it he said it before I said it
um that Twitter at the time was where he
was getting his news
and I get that but what I like best
about this tweet is the label Legacy
news
you know we've all been trying to come
up with a name that was descriptive yet
insulting
you know so you say if you say corporate
news you're like corporate news but
that's not really a cool label you know
because corporate can be good or bad you
know uh then there's the uh mainstream
media
well that doesn't really sound negative
does it
it's mainstream for a reason yeah people
like it I guess
but if you say Legacy Media
that we're even fake news right that
just sounds like an opinion but if you
say Legacy Media there's nothing to
argue with
because it is the old-fashioned media
and I love that if you want to hurt the
Legacy Media call them the Legacy Media
that's the one that that's the one that
causes pain
now I've told you before that I think
Elon Musk
uh even before I knew it was true he had
some kind of extra facility of
understanding how people work
his understanding of just human
motivation and how the brain is wired is
extraordinary for somebody who says
they're on the Spectrum which I have a
little I'm a little skeptical that he's
on the Spectrum but I guess you get to
self-identify anyway
he is far too
um keyed in on persuasion and how brains
work to be on the Spectrum
he just he seems like the opposite of
that like his understanding of human
nature is beyond average and you would
expect it to be below average if you
were on the Spectrum
now I understand that if you're on the
Spectrum and you did your studying you
could be above average right but not in
the natural way of just seeing it and
feeling it the way other people do
but Legacy Legacy news I'm going to
borrow that one
well I've told you before that Jesse
Waters is one of your best sources for
figuring out the complicated news and
what it really means and how it's
connected to things well he did it again
um I'll just read you his his words
Jesse Waters it's about uh gold bar Bob
as he calls him Bob Menendez accused of
accepting bribes and uh
Jesse Waters says we finally figured out
why gold bar Bob Menendez is being taken
out so the the accusation here is that
he's being taken out by his own side
so they had some problem with it the
president of Turkey wanted to buy f-16s
from America but gold bar Bob put a hold
on the Jets
now that Bob's out turkey's gone on the
shopping spree and is no longer going to
keep holding up a Sweden's application
to Nato like wait what
you're starting with Bob Menendez taking
money from Egyptian guys it's going all
the way to the president of Turkey to F
his 16s
to Sweden's application to Nato
now this is why nobody understands
anything in the news there's just too
many moving parts
but the simplification is that bomb
Menendez was holding something up
and you know maybe there were some
bribery motive there that's that's the
allegation
um
but apparently turkey was holding up
Sweden's application to Nato and turkey
actually said so this isn't just Jesse's
opinion
so turkey actually said that if they can
get their f-16s
they'll be a yes on Sweden for NATO
it actually was that Direct
it was exactly what it looked like this
one guy was holding it up now think
about this now I'm not so sure that
turkey needs f-16s like so I'm not sure
I'm in favor of it or against it
I don't really have any insight into
that
but what I can tell you is that there
seem to be one senator
who was doing things that didn't seem to
be for the benefit of the United States
or turkey or Sweden or NATO
so what's up with that
could it be because of bribery
well it's starting to look that way
um
did I already talk about uh
Cuellar
getting his carjacked
did I mention that or did I only say
that in the man cave
so uh what's his name Henry Henry
Cuellar is that his name
so his uh his car gets carjacked in
Washington DC now it made a lot of news
because he's a member of Congress
but he had the best public press I guess
press conference that you've ever seen I
was so impressed
so yeah so he calmly describes being
carjacked and he said there were three
men with guns
who surrounded him but here but here's
the baller thing he said he just sort of
matter of factly drops us into the
conversation because it was important it
was actually helped you understand the
situation he goes I'm a black belt in
karate
but you know there were three of them
with guns
I just love that I love the fact that
three with guns was two Betty
had it been
one person with a gun
maybe he would have just taken him out
now I don't it wouldn't have been the
smart play even if you know karate if
the other person has a gun maybe you
should you know maybe not take your best
shot uh if your car is insured
especially but I love the fact that
that's the way he answered it to let you
know that you know
it probably was closer to a fair fight
but I decided to let them live I let
them live and take my car that was a
cool answer
all right uh I have not killed any of my
critics today in case you're wondering
only two of them uh are deceased this
week
but no none of them today so I'm slowing
down on that
uh I told you this before that Nate
silver who's
you know a famous statistician
uh and Martin kohldorf if I have his
name right who's also Harvard trained
expert in statistics they're out of this
big public debate
um and it doesn't even matter what the
topic is all right it has to do with
vaccination Effectiveness but that's
irrelevant to my point
um
uh
my point is that if two experts in
statistics look at the same data and
come to opposite conclusions
how are the rest of us going to know
anything
I mean I would I wouldn't even come
close to arguing with either one of them
and I'm you know I'm pretty arrogant
and even with my level of arrogance I
wouldn't argue with either one of them
on statistics
if they've looked at the data closely
and they say here's my interpretation of
it
what do I know like how am I going to
debate either one of these guys right
they're at the top of their fields sort
of thing
but the fact that the people at the top
of the fields can look at the same data
they're not looking at different data
which is usually the problem the same
data
and opposite conclusions
does that tell you everything you need
to know about data
and about experts I think it does it's a
another another picture of how the data
well the experts were not as reliable as
we'd hoped all right let's talk about
McCarthy speaker McCarthy has been voted
out no longer the
Speaker of the House
Matt Gates led the charge and got enough
people to agree with them to kick him
out McCarthy says he will not run
to get his job back so it will be
somebody else
now the interesting thing about this is
the
responses of other people
so there's some number of people smart
people who say oh no this is a terrible
problem because it will throw the
Congress into chaos and indeed they
can't pass any legislation or do any
business by their own rules until they
get a new Speaker of the House
and it's going to be hard to get one so
from now until they figure that out
the entire Congress is Anna work they're
just not working they cannot do anything
until they get a new speaker which won't
be easy
now
do you think that uh
do you think that Matt Gates made the
right play or was it just personal as
some people say
or was he just trying to get attention
as some people say
well I would say that uh this is
demolition
you had a Congress that was unable and
unwilling this is important unable but
more importantly unwilling
to pass a budget which they were legally
required to do that would give us some
kind of relief from debt
wouldn't do it 22 years they haven't
done it
what is the correct approach wait
another 22 years
no the correct approach is demolition so
Matt Gates got out the bulldozer and he
just bulldozed Congress what can
Congress do today
nothing
nothing they can't do anything
they can do one thing which is
fix the problem that Matt Gates said was
broken
now they got to do that
so I would say um I agree with uh Vivek
ramaswamy who said uh there will be
chaos because of this move but as Vivek
says
I'm paraphrasing who says chaos is bad
where did that come from
chaos is usually the in-between step of
all Improvement there's always chaos in
the short run
so I'm 100 in favor of this action even
as crippling as it is because he just
bulldozed Congress now they're gonna
have to rebuild something that works
so I don't think they will they'll
probably rebuild something that doesn't
work but at least at least somebody did
something
so uh I'm 100 in favor of Matt Gates on
this action
let's see who else approves of it uh
among Republican voters only 22 percent
said that ousting McCarthy will be good
well 37 percent said it would be bad
let me tell you a story about by banking
days
when I was a banker
there was a
person who actually little historical
note became the physical model for the
Dilbert character
so he was the guy that I actually Drew
Dilbert based on his look
I didn't know him too well he was just
somebody in the office where I work and
he was considered such a good technical
expert that if he were ever to quit
that maybe our entire computer systems
would go down and the entire company
might actually be a risk one guy and
this this was told to me by a number of
people it's like oh he's he's the most
key employee he's the only one who knows
how to program our big computers and any
problem he's only he's the only one who
ever fixes it so if we lose him
the whole company is at risk so he could
get away with murder like he could have
bad behavior and not show up to meetings
and do whatever he wanted because he was
essential
so one day he got a better job offering
equipment
do you remember when that big Bank
failed because that one guy quit
no
do you know what happened
nothing
no
that what was it a big shock to the
system
uh for about a day we talked about it
you know what happened after that
we figured it out we just figured it
down
was it okay after that yeah it was fine
didn't make any difference at all now
how many of you have ever worked at a
company where there was a key employee
and you knew if that person ever left
you were in big problems but then they
left
and it was fine it was just fine
yeah we've all had that experience if
you've been in a big company
now do you believe that McCarthy was so
valuable to this process because
apparently he was a good speaker
a lot of people say he did a good job on
a number of things
no he's not he's not Irreplaceable and
the chaos will not be worse than what
the situation was before the chaos
so as fake says
chaos might be the the useful step
before you fix something
uh there's a lot of talk about Trump
being nominated for a speaker I will
give that a zero percent chance of
happening
zero percent chance
I don't think Trump takes the uh third
in line for the presidency job
you know once you've been president you
don't take the one that's third in line
say oh I can get something done I could
do some useful things if I'm third in
line for the presidency yeah not going
to happen he's not going to run for the
Senate he's not going to it's just not
gonna happen there's no way his
personality would be compatible with
that
um so the temporary speaker of the house
is Patrick McHenry
uh and as if as you know uh it was the
the debt and the budget that were the
problems that got rid of the old speaker
so Patrick McHenry
um he gave a speech he said Give me
liberty or give me debt
Patrick McHenry anybody history nerds
history Nerds come on give it up
Give me liberty or give me debt come on
that wasn't terrible
dad joke time but uh Patrick McHenry
also did an move uh he's gonna
kick Nancy Pelosi out of her nice office
apparently she has a nicer than normal
office so now that he's the Speaker of
the House for like a day
he doesn't have many Powers because I
can't vote anything but he's the speaker
of the house so he kicks her out of her
office and takes her office
kind of funny
yeah this guy the funny
he got a coveted Hideaway office
uh because just because he wanted it for
himself
I I kind of love the fact
that if you saw him bang the gavel you
knew he was really angry about McCarthy
being uh taken out so he was not in
favor of what happened so when he bangs
the gavel to end the thing he just like
I thought he was I thought he was going
to break the gavel like he hit it hard
enough I expected the head of the gavel
would just come right off
so this guy is really pissed about what
happens and then as soon as he gavels
Nancy Pelosi from her own office and
moves him
I like his style
yeah it was petty it was Patty but it
was also funny
and therefore I approve of it
well here's a small item Europe has
ended Free Speech which will certainly
end in America
do you want any more about that topic
free space actually ended
in my opinion it's gone
you could say it was gone before but but
Europe has this thing called the Digital
Services Act
uh uh which Glenn Greenwald calls uh the
eu's most repressive online censorship
laws and
um
the plan is to force according to the
New York Times They want to force social
media sites to censor more
including in the U.S
so the U.S will end up
going along with whatever the big social
media networks do and they probably have
to bow to Europe
for business reasons so it looks like
Europe will lead the
elimination of free speech in America
Europe will because Europe will
influence social media social media is
our only real mechanism of free speech
because the Legacy Media is old
so the Europeans are taking away the
free speech in America
actually that's actually happening
yeah thanks Germans
in Germany strikes again
all right
well we'll see if we can fight back
about against that in America but that's
the way it's going it looks like free
speech is on the way out
um but sure we don't have a congress
anymore
that's true we don't trust our experts
anymore well that's true but
the one thing I can feel good about
at least I have health care
right at least I have health care I have
a Kaiser Permanente that's the name of
the healthcare organization I use
oh Kaiser's going on strike today uh
they could interrupt Health Service for
13 million people including including
cartoonist Scott Adams
yeah
so
okay so I don't have a congress I don't
have free speech
and I don't have health care at the
moment
but the good news is that Patrick
McHenry
much better office
and that's something I mean that's not
nothing
I like him to be happy too
well uh you may be aware of Laverne
Spicer
who is very active on the x-platform
she's running for congress in Florida
and she's a black woman which is
important to this story
so Laverne Spicer black woman
again important to the story
tweeted or posted this today
I just saw a heartbreaking story about a
New York man that was stabbed to death
at a bus stop
the same man who had messaged me on X a
few days before that then I saw the one
about the Baltimore woman that was
murdered in her building by a black man
she let in
then Laverne says I'm just going to say
it
white folks you all need to move out of
these Democratic cities
Democrats got black folks all riled up
against you
they done cut back your police forces
and they do cash a release on violent
felons
if y'all ever want to be safe again move
to republican-run areas even if you hate
us we'll still protect you
so she's Republican and she says even
even if you hate us we'll still protect
you because we're Republicans
so
um
does that remind you of anything
does that sound like
I don't know it's got there's something
about it that reminds me of something
but I can't I can't place it
hmm
do you think she'll be canceled for
saying that white people should move
away from black people
I think she said it in the clever way by
saying it's a democratic City
had I said Democrats any
but I was making a larger point about
Dei and CRT and ESG so for me it wasn't
about the city so much it's just a
really related point
right well no she will not be canceled
because she's black and female and if
you're black and female you do still
have free speech
I don't in any practical way oh
can I invite Dale over
Scott
social media companies are private
companies
it's only the government that can take
away your free speech
yes Dale that was a good argument in the
1980s
yeah before social media good argument
now it's just stupid
yeah it's stupid to argument argue that
you have the right to speak but not the
ability we'll take your ability to speak
away oh but you have the right
you have a right to free assembly oh we
are going to lock you by the ankle in
Chains in your house
but if you were not locked by your ankle
you could certainly have the right to
get together
the fact that we prevent you from doing
it is unrelated to your right you have
the right to get together we just happen
to put you in jail
all right
um
so that's happening
I would put this also in the category of
demolition so what Laverne Spicer is
doing and by the way I agree with every
word she said as you know
um well Laverne is saying is that the
cities are unsavable
and that we're in the demolition phase
right so your best bet is just to get
away from the wrecking ball
if you can
um
do you know actor Brian Austin Green
he was married to Megan Fox for a while
he was on 90210
and apparently for four and a half years
he had symptoms like a stroke
you said he could barely walk he was
walking like a 90 year old man
and doctors couldn't figure out what it
was you know there was stress but stress
alone probably wasn't the cause
and then finally he went to some other
you know non-traditional Doctor Who said
the problem was inflammation from gluten
and maybe Dairy and that it was
inflammation that was making them
feel like that so as soon as he changed
his diet he's perfectly fine again just
like he always was now here's what
caught my attention
I told you that I went through two and a
half years of feeling like I had a
stroke
and of course you thought it was the
vaccinations but it started before the
vaccinations
and it started before covert as well so
in my case but it could have been my
blood pressure meds or something else I
don't know but for two and a half years
I felt like I was a zombie
and then just to lose some weight I
stopped eating wheat I just took wheat
out of my diet for a little while
and all of my problems went away
all of them
I had I had exactly the same problem and
Brian Austin Green found out that gluten
was the problem
and that was my problem as well
and by the way I'm not celiac
so apparently the gluten has more than
one way it could affect some people I
don't know if it affects everybody but
some people
so if you did a Celiac test you wouldn't
pick it up
but my sister informed me that that
there is a genetic propensity to some
wheat inflammation
because she got tested I guess
so
why is it that you don't know
the gluten might be more dangerous than
you think do you think it has anything
to do with how big that business is
like maybe probably has everything to do
with how big a business that is
that's my guess
so when I see a story like this I say to
myself huh I wonder how many people
are just walking around just crippled
and they don't notice their diet
I bet it's a lot
don't you think that's a lot
but I don't want to get sued for saying
wheat is bad so I'm no doctor so I'm not
going to say that I'll just say there's
two anecdotes
which is not enough to form any kind of
a scientific opinion but it's kind of a
coincidence
that somebody had the same symptoms as
me and solved it the same way
in my case it was accidental
is that kind of a big coincidence isn't
it yeah
kind of a big coincidence
all right ladies and gentlemen
those are things I wanted to talk about
were there some stories I forgot
yeah it could be just coincidence
um
about your bodies and commercial on the
bed system I think to sell to use to
feel Superior about our bodies I don't
know why you'd want to do that
um
so Jim Jordan is being put forward as a
potential Speaker of the House Jim
Jordan seems
very capable
um but he's very political maybe that's
what the job requires
I don't know if they need somebody who's
a peacekeeper or a political bomb
thrower
but uh
I see Jordan as more of a political bomb
thrower
but he's very capable
Lee zeldin would be better if somebody
says I don't know if he's considering it
oh Vivek as Speaker
that's interesting
I don't think he has the credibility in
Congress though
all right
um
oh Jordan was supporting McCarthy
yesterday
so
I love the fact that
um
Congress was crashed
because allegedly the speaker lied to
Gates
how much do you love the fact that Matt
Gates fired his boss in a sense the
speaker of the house he fired his boss
because his boss lied to him
now there might be more to it but that's
sort of the surface story I kind of love
that
if you could fire your boss for lying to
you and no other reason
I'm cool
yeah do you know what I really found
distasteful
is people who understood that
that McCarthy had lied to Gates
about the separate spending bills
and they were still okay with him
because he did a good job otherwise
I don't get that at all
if the Speaker of the House lies to you
on a real Central topic this was not
some small side topic
the question was do you get to vote on
budget bills or just run up the run up
the debt Forever Until We All Die
the most important question of Congress
and he lied about it allegedly but it
looks like that might have happened
yeah I'm perfectly fine with firing the
most effective leader you've ever had if
he lied to you about something that
basic
now you're going to say to me
but Scott
Trump says things that are not true all
the time
correct
and we all know it and we all process it
that way right we process it as
Hyperbole and we process it as at best
you know directionally correct
so I don't think it's the same thing
you know if if Trump had been speaker of
the house and made a direct promise of
the same kind I'd have the same problem
because that's like a real promise
that's not you know
exaggeration sort of things that
politicians do
that was more person to person that was
personal
and if if gase treats it as personal he
has that right
yeah if gay says this was personal you
lied to me in the in the capacity as the
leader is still personal
and if he took it personal and acted on
it and crashed Congress because of it
I'm okay with that
that maybe the next person won't lie
right maybe the next person will think
twice
I think you have to have at least that
kind of reaction
yeah it's all about Ukraine probably all
about Ukraine but I do love
that the people who crashed the Congress
were saying no more money for Ukraine if
we're going to leave the Border open
um
we must have a lot of non-members over
here because I'm getting a lot of dumb
comments
handshake deals are legally binding that
is correct
uh Devin Nunes well that'd be
interesting
him being Anna politics
all right
um I don't think there's anybody outside
of Congress
who could get the vote
and I think probably there's no way
that's going to happen
because I think the members of Congress
want to make sure that only a member of
Congress can get that job even though
constitutionally that's not a
requirement
it's weird that it's not a requirement
in the concept I feel like the
Constitution just made a mistake
by not making it a requirement that you
remember
um
Mark Levin when scorched Earth on
I don't care
I don't care
if you want to see who's right let's
just wait
my prediction is that the so-called
chaos in Congress will have no effect on
you
I don't think you I don't think you and
I will have any even notice it
it'll just be a news report for a week
and then they'll have a new speaker and
everything will go on
yeah
oh could I be speaker
that's a good question could I be speak
now I'd get destroyed
couldn't survive it
all right can Gates get any Democrat
support well only when it's in their
self-interest
does the Constitution established the
speaker's office
I don't know
it does
oh it does okay
um
is the stream going to be monetized all
right so here's what I'm doing
differently on
YouTube
so YouTube does this thing where it just
stuffs an unconscionable number of ads
almost like they're trying to kill it
they put so many ads in that what we had
been doing is manually removing them so
there were still some ads
but it wasn't unwatchable
and I've just decided to embrace and
amplify
meaning that if YouTube wants to make
their product unwatchable
by adding so many ads then I'm going to
leave them in there
and if you complain enough now there's I
think there's no ads in the live version
right the live version doesn't have ads
so you'll still get your live version
but the recorded version you should just
watch it somewhere else
so you can see it on Rumble
which would also have ads or if you're a
member of the locals Community you can
watch it there
and at least for a while I'm going to
leave it unlocked so you wouldn't have
to be a member at the moment but I'll
probably lock it at some point in the
future so if you wanted to sample it I'm
going to leave it unlocked for a little
while I'll let the ads just build up on
YouTube and we'll just see what happens
well
you can't stop the ads on the recorded
version
because the recorded version will just
stop and wait for the ad right the ad
blockers can't
yeah fast forward
can I hypnotize them to do better
if you pay yeah or you could pay YouTube
to have no ads that's correct you could
get your your higher end YouTube account
that works as well
well ad blocker can only block an ad but
it can't afford fast forward the video
am I Norway
whatever that means
am I Norway
unblock means no ads no pausing and
waiting for ads Etc on YouTube how's
that possible
that's not possible
Brave does it I don't believe that
all right I don't believe what you're
telling me
I the brave browser was like a a virus
on my system I had to get rid of it
all right
um because there are too many things
that want Chrome to work
um YouTube is censored
ad blocker well I'm not going to
encourage you to use ad blockers
uh
do whatever you want to do
Styx has no ads oh you could run without
ads why would Styx have no ads
how is he monetizing does he do his own
commercials
I'm not going to guess monsters
now as soon as I'm beholden to sponsors
even if they don't ask me to do anything
I would know what to say and what not to
say
no good I I don't think I could do this
job with sponsors now I do there are
advertisements but they're irrelevant to
my actions I don't really see them or
pick them or even know how many there
are
sticks gets donations
he sells edited books instead
uh
created The Four Seasons what
um
I'll I'll publish for you a list of the
podcasts I've been on so you can see the
links there have been a bunch of them
now I don't have any plans to be on
any of the big ones that I haven't
mentioned
if I get invited on one of the big
podcasts I'll let you know
yeah I know I can stop the ads myself
that's what we were doing but we choose
not to
um Will trump Prevail or lose his wealth
do you think Trump will actually have
his businesses seized I mean he would
still be the beneficiary of the income
but somebody else would manage it
emergency test today I don't know about
any emergency test
he lost his Casino well that was a
special case
all right
well that's all I got for you today I'm
gonna go do some other things and you're
going to have the most amazing day
just remember don't worry about the
demolition phase
the demolition phase had to happen
we're in it but we're real good at
rebuilding creative phase coming soon
uh
so people are really mad at me and
yelling in all caps Jay says Scott
listen to people who know more about it
than you Adblock stops ads on live and
recorded videos on YouTube
how could it possibly stop a recorded
video
how's that even possible
all right
FEMA emergency alert today why was that
I'm not going to test that because I
don't believe it
ads are a separated stream
how in the world could there be no
pauses
I'm very skeptical of that
all right
they're pinging all devices at 11 20 A.M
really
so it hasn't happened yet
all right
well so let me talk to the NPCs here
sometimes I get pushback for not testing
things
that could be tested
but you know I don't have time to test
everything that could be tested right
you have to call your shots
um
and I don't believe technically there's
a way to do what you say all of you are
sure can be done and you've witnessed it
yourself I still don't believe it
sorry
um so I probably won't test it
all right
but there are a thousand people here
using Adblock and all having the same
experience
and I also don't believe it
well should I believe because a lot of
people say it's true is that your point
is your point that I should believe it
because a lot of people say it's true
that's the argument you're giving me
your argument is a lot of people saw it
with their own eyes so it's true
can you think of anything else that
thousands of people saw with their own
eyes and their own experience and yet it
wasn't true
like every every UFO report
every hoax find people hoax drinks Bleak
jokes yeah now if you're under the
impression that because you've all
experienced it and you're telling me
directly that I should be convinced by
that that's not how anything works
that's not how anything works
all right
uh describe the wrong person the bank
robbery that's true
everybody gets the Pegasus virus today
when they do the the test that may be
true
all right
all right let's uh talk about that
tomorrow and I'll see you tomorrow
YouTube
bye for now
