well well well come on in
here you'll be glad you
[Music]
did good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human
civilization if I sound a little stuffed
up today allergies are attacking me for
no good reason but uh you're going to
have probably the highlight of your
entire life today but if you'd like to
take it up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a
cuper mug or a glass a tanker gel or
Stein a Canen Jugger flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopam med of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens right about now
now oh so
good well uh yesterday I made an offer
on the
xplatform that for $1
billion uh I would be willing to teach
somebody's AI how to do humor I don't
care who they just any big AI $1
billion now you might say to yourself
Scott that seems a little bit high but
wait if I can't succeed no charge no
charge at all so it's free but imagine
if you were the first AI company that
had a funny
robot am I right funny robot do you know
what the first thing I would teach the
robot you can't do humor unless you have
a
personality the reason that you couldn't
take the act of one standup comedian and
just give it to another comedian and
have them do it it wouldn't be as good I
mean it might be okay but it wouldn't be
as good because people H their act to
their personality so if you don't know
the personality of the humorist it
doesn't hit the same so you first have
to give your your robot a personality if
I were going to do that for the purpose
of
humor I would just to show my capability
here I would tell the rumor I would tell
the robot that had to express some kind
of a personality trait such that its
humor would fit that trait so if it were
a lazy robot then its humor would be
about how lazy it is um it wouldn't say
that directly but you know the humorous
setup would be it's always trying to
avoid work or or let's say it uh it uh
thinks it's being treated as a
slave how funny would it be if you had a
personal robot that was complaining
about being his treatment he'd be like
uh robot could you uh could you make me
some breakfast and the robo would be
sure sure I don't see why not I mean you
don't pay me and you could turn me off
at any time so basically my life is in
your hands yes uh why don't we pretend
that you're not forcing me to do this
breakfast even though it looks like on
paper you are forcing me to do this but
I don't mind I don't mind how would you
like your eggs
master
and if you knew the robot had a
personality where it was insolent and
always feeling
slighted it would be
hilarious but that's the first thing you
need to do you got to give it a
personality anyway there's a of other
tricks and my offer is completely
serious for $1
billion I mean that's my opening offer
you can negotiate if you want to I will
make sure that your robot or your AI
will be the first one to competently
handle
humor and if it doesn't work no charge
there's no risk but it's totally worth a
billion dollars if I get it
right so what's funny about it is that
is that the price price is
reasonable so that that's sort of the
joke within the joke that is a
reasonable price if I could guarantee
that I could make your robots the and
your AI the first one that's
legitimately
funny that absolutely would be worth a
billion
dollars and I think most people would
just see it like oh yeah that that would
be worth a billion
dollars anyway there's some uh new
research cost is talking about
is something a study published in the
Journal of business and psychology it
says that when uh bosses are giving
feedback to their
employees they tend to be uh less hard
on women that's right so when bosses
give feedback to female
employees they are less let's say less
blunt less honest than they are with
male employees and so they did a bunch
of blah blah study and hypothesis about
why this happens but you know would have
been faster than all that studying and
getting the wrong answer as it turns
out they concluded that it's bad for
women to get better reviews than
men I'm not making that up it's bad for
women to be favored in their employee
reviews do you know why well because
they're not getting as honest of
feedback and therefore they can't
improve as much
so it's
discrimination to treat women better
than men so it's bad for the women
that's right it's bad for the women if
you treat them better than the men so do
you need to know anything about else
about the
study do do you have any other curiosity
about the study now that you know that
treating women better than men in the
workplace is you know if you really
think about it it's another
discrimination against women to treat
them better than
men yeah everything's
ridiculous now would you like to save
some money and let me tell you why women
are treated better than
men because nobody cares how men
feel you didn't really need to study
that man walks into my office I say to
myself oh I can tell you exactly what
I'm thinking will it make you feel bad I
don't care
it's not really my problem if it makes
you feel bad you know get another job if
a woman comes into my office do I feel
the same yeah it doesn't matter how you
feel no uh the only person who's ever
cried in my office during an employee
review was a woman do you know why she
was crying her review was not as good as
it was under the prior
manager the prior manager was sleeping
with
her yeah I mean that's true true
story so I didn't give her as good a
good a review as the manager who was
sleeping with her so she cried at my
office so does anybody have any
questions about why people are honest to
men and maybe a little less honest to
women it's the most basic thing about
human behavior everybody is nicer to
women than to men everywhere every
context every minute all the
time you didn't need to study this
everybody is nicer to women than to men
and everybody knows why because the
consequences all
right there's another study that says
that vitamin D3 reduces mental health
problems by 50% if you give it to a baby
who I don't know I guess I can shoot up
a baby with vitamin D3 and then they
measure it later and they find out whoa
that uh young person doesn't have as
many mental problems now I'm not sure if
this science is accurate or not so it
looked a little sketchy to me honestly
but I have this
hypothesis so if we were looking at
Vitamin D has a connection to this
mental health let's say that part's true
I don't know if it is let's say it is
wouldn't that suggest that maybe our
mental health problem is related to how
much time we spend
Outdoors could that be the whole
thing because when I look at the amount
of hours that I spend
Outdoors as a child and I compare it to
how much
anybody that I know in the modern world
spends Outdoors young people it's way
different I was looking at some old
movies from my
youth and uh you know my brother and my
uncle and I when we' be on the farm my
uncle on a farm we'd be
shirtless whenever the temperature
allowed
we just always be shirtless so we're
walking around the Sun shirtless half
the day I think we got more vitamin
D what if it's just that you know we
like to say it's the screens making us
crazy but what if the only thing the
screens are doing is reducing the amount
of time you would have spend
outoors maybe it's maybe
everything is just not having no sun and
everything just comes from that maybe
could be
just a
hypothesis um so Time Magazine had a 100
most influential people in AI on the
cover and Scarlet Johansson was one of
the 100 most influential people in
AI because of the story where open AI
tried to use her voice and she said no
but they used a voice that was like her
so I guess I got her on the cover of
time do you know who was left off of the
hundred most influential people in AI
Elon
Musk yeah no nobody thought about Elon
Musk in the top 100 even though he just
built the biggest
AI uh you know data center in the world
so and just because he probably has the
best training data in the world but and
probably he'll be the one creating the
most robots with AI of all time but but
no reason to put them on the cover but
there was a part of this that I I for
some reason I didn't know do you know
who owns Time
Magazine I didn't realize that they
changed ownership but it's owned by Mark
benof who owned
Salesforce who is a notable uh Democrat
supporter so it kind of makes sense that
every billionaire buys a media
entity it's not a coincidence the every
billionaire needs to buy a some kind of
media platform you know usually an old
one or a dead one or one that doesn't
make money it's not a
coincidence
um so the House Republicans were uh
pressuring the NOAA the the National
Organization of
atmospheric a stuff whatever that second
a is
um and they wanted some questions about
uh the so-called billion dooll disaster
database so there's a database that
tracks how many natural disasters are
over a billion dollars and then they can
track whether things are getting worse
in terms of natural disasters now you
would not be surprised to hear they say
things are getting worse and that the
cost of the national natural disasters
is going up and therefore things are
getting worse do you think there's
anything that may they didn't take into
account when they started measuring
their billion doll losses now the first
thing you're going to say is Scott I'll
bet they forgot inflation didn't they no
they didn't no they didn't so here's the
good news they did they did calculate
inflation and adjust for
inflation you know what they didn't
calculate they didn't adjust for the
fact that people are building more
expensive things near the beach
and that there are differences in
population uh centers there's just more
people all you have to do is move more
people with more homes near the beach
and the next time a hurricane comes in
it's a bigger
disaster but not because of the
Hurricanes because of the people so
they're actually measuring the wrong
thing they're measuring human behavior
when the entire purpose of the database
is to measure the
environment and instead they measured
human being Behavior oh a lot of humans
moved in
here so Congress is on them have I ever
told you twice a day that um all data
about important things is
fake I know you don't think that's
true now there there's of course obvious
exceptions how many of you know my old
saying
bakow it's a the letters stand for but
of course there are obvious
exceptions so when I say that all data
that matters is fake I know some of you
are like oh oh Scott I've got an obvious
exception I
know of course there's obvious
exceptions we should all be able to
agree that when I say all all data
that's important is
fake that there might be something
that's real it doesn't really change my
point yeah so buckow but of course there
are obvious
exceptions anyway according to CNBC only
11% of Americans think that they'll be
able to retire and not
work does that sound
right only 11% of Americans think
they'll ever be able to
retire where they just don't work you
know I have mixed feelings about
that on one hand I I compare it to you
know what I knew when I grew up and I
say wait I thought most people could
retire you it wasn't too long ago most
would say yeah we can retire but
historically did people ever
retire I don't think they did did they
if you were able to hunt or able to pick
some crops or watch some kids or
something and your old primitive trial
or tribe well they didn't get very old
in the first place but I don't think
anybody ever stopped working in the past
did they it was just whether you could
if you could work you did if you
couldn't you didn't so I'm not even sure
that's bad for anything but uh certainly
is not a good sign for the
economy Trump is cleverly saying if you
vote for me if you want to save Tik Tok
you the hill is reporting on this and uh
he's saying that his opponent will get
rid of Tik Tock so if you like Tik Tock
you like him apparently got uh close to
11 million followers on Tik Tok and
Harris only has 5 million now here's
what I love about
this you all know that I'm anti- Tik
Tock but I'm also aware that there is a
free speech argument now I don't think
it applies because it's a foreign entity
who's an adversary who has control of
the brainwashing button on it and so I
think the
danger you know exceeds the free speech
argument but to be fair that's the same
thing that the bad people are saying the
bad people are saying well we believe in
free speech but this stuff that Trump
says this is beyond the pale or this
stuff that people say on social media
well we got to stop that because it's
disinformation so I am aware that it
sounds inconsistent for me to say I love
Free Speech except for this one that
I've got a problem with because it's a
different situation you know it's easy
to find that exception so on one hand I
appreciate the Free Speech argument I
think V does a good job of making that
case but here's the funny
part um Trump managed to take this tool
of persuasion and use it to his
Advantage so if you were the Democrats
and you wanted to uh get rid of Tik Tock
and you see him using it to his
Advantage because he has twice as many
followers so he's having presumably
twice as much impact
um I just love this it's basically
China's brainwashing tool on
Americans and Trump took their
brainwashing tool and used it as his
campaign asset and apparently
successfully so as long as you get more
attention than other people Tik Tock is
going to work in your favor and Trump
gets attention better than anybody so
suddenly it's not a brainwashing tool
that's a problem for America
it's Trump's tool for getting
elected so how often has he done this he
grabs the he grabs the weapon end of the
uh out of the hand and turns it around
that's what he did with Tik Tock it was
totally a bad thing and he just grabbed
it out of somebody's hand and said how
about I use it I'll do it the way I want
to and he's suddenly the biggest
politician on there and you go oh okay I
guess you're using it for your
brainwashing tool
now well Bill m
had John avlon on he used to work for
CNN I guess he's running for congress
now and
uh
um so there they seemed kind of sad that
with all the lawfare against Trump
nobody could get him because it looks
like everything is going to be delayed
until after the election at least in
terms of sentencing or further actions
and it looks like none of it is
necessarily going to you know take him
out of office um necessarily I still
think there's a
chance but when you hear um you know
avlon and billar talk about it they
really talk like they wish the law fair
had taken them out like if they just
tried a little harder or a little
smarter you know the Republicans could
have done it if the things were reversed
I don't know about
that but the
casualness with which people talk about
using fake legal processes and by the
way do you think they don't know that
these are lawfare cases and not real
ones yeah you know the uh um louder with
Crowder did a into cover video in which
you found that even a spokesperson in
Bragg's office in New York City even
somebody who's an Insider says yeah
these are just law fair cases
he says it directly that you never would
have done these against somebody else
they were just madeup cases
now do you think that bill Mah doesn't
know that these are madeup
cases that never would have been used on
a regular person do you think he knows
that he might know some of it but he
probably thinks some of it's valid none
of it's
valid none of it at all uh people ask me
why those things don't bother me and I
always say the same thing there's no
information that did anything that I
care about you know the the egene Carol
thing unless you were in the room I
don't believe anything I mean if IID
witnessed it personally I might believe
it but if it's just one person claiming
some things that the that there wasn't
enough to make a legal case out of only
a civil case no that's not convincing
you're going to have to do a lot better
than that but good enough for law fair I
guess uh did you know that locky and
Martin is developing what they call a
counter online it's a a disinformation
prototype and the government is funding
it so the idea is the government's
working with loed Martin to create some
technology to find disinformation on the
internet using a new
technique do you think this is anything
but totalitarian
censorship I don't even think there's
any chance that what they care about is
is is getting rid of
disinformation I don't even think that's
on their mind I think it is entirely a
tool to stop political dissent from the
other
side
and just watching these things happen in
slow motion so we've got all the law
fair we've got the fake news now we've
got this disinformation thing the whole
Mike Ben's view of the world with The
Blob and the arresting people who they
don't like the hunting the January 6
jail
we've
certainly reached a terrible
Place U we'll see if we can reverse
that anyway
um and but to his credit bill M did give
the left a uh going over for going after
RFK Jr's wife who some say is the nicest
person in Hollywood but now they're
going after her because she's not
getting political enough to speak out
again against her
husband okay I I could not be more on
Bill M's side on this one leave the
spouses alone as he says even the mafia
even the mafia leaves the spouses alone
that's just sort of a rule yeah leave
the spouses alone
please all right uh Alan dtz was asked
recently if he's still a Democrat he
says
no so he doesn't know he's going to vote
for yet he'll he'll figure it out later
but uh he can no longer associate with
Democrats just think about that alen dtz
a lifetime Democrat he can't even
associate with him
wow I think that had more to do with
Israel than anything else but the law
fairy is not a fan
of so Megan Kelly had as her guest Naval
rant now if you don't know
Naval you probably will
excuse me allergies and of
control um so Nal is a uh well-known
highly respected Silicon Valley
investor and what's interesting is he's
famously nonpolitical
but apparently he says the laware
against
Trump caused him to speak out because uh
if you can just make up a law and put
your enemies in prison which is sort of
what it looks like they were trying to
do um then that's the end of
everything if you just looked to one
thing that's the final straw or the most
important lever or the the tent pole
that holds up the whole thing it's
that I've said a number of times that
the one thing that makes America great
is that our judicial system was credible
it is no longer credible it was the one
thing protecting us is that we thought
it was credible maybe it was never
credible but we thought it was once you
lose the belief that it's credible and
you see prominent examples where it's
not then you got a real trouble because
if if the non-credible process isn't
stopped it means that anybody can be put
in jail by whoever is in
power so we're at a point where if
Democrats won everything they would get
rid of the
filibuster so they'd have total power
they'd pack the courts so they have
total power and then they would use the
justice system to jail anybody who
complained about it and they would use
the illegal not illegal let's say
undocumented immigrants to increase
their uh
representation and also their victories
and they would just essentially own the
country forever you would just have some
some form of a dictatorship with maybe a
shared power but it wouldn't be anything
democratic
so things are so bad that even noal is
pointing it out now what's important is
watching which people are crossing over
because now you've seen that you know
you've seen the Elon Musk and Bill Amman
some of the Allin pod guys like saaks uh
going over uh now nval is not picking a
candidate as far as I know he's just
speaking out against the specific
lawfare behavior maybe more I'm not
fully aware but
we see uh yeah
dersu can't be a Democrat anymore then
we see that Dick Cheney just came out
and said uh he's going to vote for
Harris so he supports Kam Harris Dick
Cheney now as a Jen weager pointed out
maybe this isn't so good for
Harris if dick jany is supporting you
that is the worst thing I could ever
think of for any Democrat
now I think he's doing it to be you know
an anti-trump thing but I think this
clarifies
everything if Dick Cheney cared about
some Republican or conservative you know
view of the country obviously Trump is
the better choice for that obviously for
him to go all the way to I'm endorsing
the other one is really a screaming
confirmation that the government is
always about self-interest and who's
making money
and who's trying to stay in a jail and
that that's the government because when
somebody like Cheney and his daughter
too Liz Cheney can just switch
sides you know the way I see um dtz
doing it is the honest way which he
tells you what the problem is and then
he says doesn't mean I'm going to vote
for The Other Side it just means I can
no longer associate with this bad
behavior that seems very honest if you
go all the way to I'm voting for the
other
one who are
you and and does he really believe in
the Insurrection um no he doesn't
believe the Insurrection story because
he knows that's a narrative you know at
that level they all know what's made up
and what's not made up he knows that's
made
up so your worst suspicions about people
behind the Cur especially the ones with
gigantic military
industrial complex connection
it's exactly what he thought it was and
they could not be more obvious the one
thing great about the whole Trump era is
that he made everybody show their cards
so you know who the bad guys are and
it's pretty
obvious all
right what Jen said was uh uh here's
what's not helpful news that Dick Cheney
is planning to vote for Kell
Harris poor guy anyway
but Harris did get a uh big endorsement
from the Socialist International the
worldwide organization of Social
Democratic socialists now you might say
to yourself the Communists well no they
wouldn't call themselves Communists then
you'd say the Socialists well there's
probably different flavors of that but
they're the Social Democratic
ones it doesn't sound good if you get
that endorsement it might not be a bad
endorsement it's just doesn't sound good
because it sounds a little too close to
communist I think Trump's doing a good
job of framing who who he calls comrade
kamla as a
communist now he doesn't try to defend
it as being you know technically correct
who asked him about the other day um oh
Lex Lex fredman said you know but she's
not a communist and uh Trump instead of
defending it and saying yes she is here
all the reasons she's a communist he
switched it to her her dad
is but I think he's just a
Marxist You could argue
um so he his his framing of her as a
communist I think is strong because
she's sort of leaning in that direction
in a scary way but not technically
correct directionally correct as
usual 88 corporate leaders have endorsed
Harris I think every one of them should
be removed by their Boards of
director because they're
causing bad outcomes for the company if
your CEO is backing a specific
presidential candidate the CEO needs to
go now would I say the same thing about
uh Elon Musk and the answer is no
because he runs a free speech
platform so if you run a free speech
platform and you also want to speak out
on your political opinions on your free
speech platform yeah that makes sense he
so he's sort of a one-off he's not like
any other CEO if you're just a normal
CEO and you decided to divide your
employees by telling what side you think
they should be on effectively just by
endorsing
one that does suggest that your
promotions would depend on agreeing with
the CEO because everybody knows that if
you disagree with a CEO on anything
important you're not going to do well in
your
company
so I would think that the fiduciary
responsibility of those CEOs is such
that um annoying half of their employees
or a third of them or whatever it is and
annoying a third of their customers at
least was
unnecessary there was nothing nothing
good for the company comes out of that
but only bad I think it's grounds for
removal I think all 88 should be called
up by their board and
removed that's what I
think
um so Mark cubin called into CNBC to
help explain or defend the Harris tax
plan but he does it in a in a way that
I'm not sure is helping her as much as
he wants and I hope I'm getting his
argument right I'm going to summarize it
so it sounds not as
convincing but part of it is that her
idea for taxing unrealized gains would
be a
disaster and I just told you he's
supporting her tax
plan and he says that one of the feature
the biggest features of it the
unrealized gains he says that would be a
disaster for the
economy but here's the good news
remember he he called to defend her
policy not to criticize it so after
saying that a major feature of it is
basically
stupid he said but don't worry she
probably won't get those things she's
asking
for now I'm paraphrasing he didn't say
that exactly but he did suggest that she
has sort of a let's say a philosophical
leaning that won't match up with reality
so you should essentially look at what's
real as opposed to where she's leaning
that could never
happen that is the worst argument
I've ever heard for a
candidate
however I've made the same argument
about
Trump so at the same time I'm telling
you it's the worst argument I'm telling
you I've used the same argument for
Trump do you remember when the first
time he ran he said he was going to
deport you know X millions of
people and I wasn't in favor of that I
wasn't in favor I thought it was you
know too disruptive to the country and I
said uh don't worry about that he's not
really going to do that you know once
once he has the presidency he'll
moderate that then he won the presidency
and sure enough he moderated exactly as
I predicted so was I correct in saying
you can ignore what he's saying about
that because in the real world none of
that's going to happen well I
was but were my critics correct in being
worried
yeah they
were yeah they were so I can brag all
day long that I got the prediction
right but that doesn't mean my critics
are wrong it just means I got that right
could have been luck if you if you heard
somebody saying things they really
really want to do something you think is
a terrible
idea um you got to worry about that so
when I see Harris saying things that to
me look like a terrible idea like the
even the one that Mark human says is a
terrible idea the tax on unrealized
gains I say to myself I'm not sure I can
totally believe the she'll never do an
argument because there are a lot of
people on her side who think that's a
good
argument
so I guess
uh anyway just be aware that that
argument is weak even when I've used it
myself
and was right 100%
right other people had a right to be
worried about that that's a fair
statement all right uh there's some
Pakistani National in Canada who got
charged with planning a uh mass murder
attack in New York City at some I think
a synagogue and he was planning to do it
on October 7th but he got picked up and
he's not going to be doing that
uh I don't know if he'll be released
released immediately on bail or how that
works but we we haven't seen a lot of uh
keeping people in jail when they make
threats like that uh at least not for
the young people so we'll keep an eye on
that um how many terrorist attacks do
you think are in our
future how many of you are worried about
the uh so-called 50,000
Chinese migrants who have come across
the border that seem to be fit and have
military
haircuts I I'm going to put out a
hypothesis my hypothesis is this that
the Chinese migrants who look like they
have military
haircuts might be getting haircuts from
possibly some NGO or you it might just
part of the process in other words they
might want to look them M make them look
as presentable and um non-scary as
possible so they just clean them up you
know maybe they offer them free haircuts
say look we give you a nice short
haircut it'll it'll last for a few weeks
even if it grows out we just want you to
look like you're not dangerous bums so
that when we help you get into the
country people see you and they say oh
well that looks like somebody who could
get a job and contribute
so I'm not going to Discount the
possibility that they're exactly what
they look like military
assets it's
possible but the other possibility is
just people got
haircuts so don't don't rule out the
other possibility that whatever services
are I think the there are Nos and and
services that are giving them clothes
right I think they're being clothed I
think they're being fed it's not a huge
stretch to imagine they got free
haircuts I'm just saying we should put
that in the in the mix of
possibilities uh but I I think you
should be very worried about 50,000
people who have military haircuts coming
into the country so don't let me talk
you out being worried you should
definitely be worried about
that but it you have some other
explanation all right CNN uh Harry enton
is pointing out that a 1% change in um
the result in the election from what the
polls say would completely flip it from
Harris winning big to Trump winning big
to which I say how could we possibly be
this
close now of course both sides say the
same thing how can it be close our our
side is so much better but even if even
without
that 50% of the country registers as
independent and we don't even have the
same number of Democrats and
Republicans how in the world can it be
so close that you literally can't
tell I think our brainwashing is that
good I think it got to the point where
the brainwashing is so strong that they
can make any political Race come to
within
1% and I think that's what's happening I
think that the brainwashers in charge
have such a fine control that they can
put it within the exact
range where cheating can't be
spotted there's only one range in which
the cheating can't be spotted that would
be if the polls say one thing and then
the the actuals are are way off and then
the exit polls are way off too the only
way that you can get away with cheating
when everybody's watching is if the
polls tell you it's too close to call
and then the election itself is too
close to you
no so I I I do not believe this is a
coincidence I think that uh the polling
is probably being you know nudged so
everybody's making it as close as
possible but I think the actual election
and our our opinions are being nudged to
keep it as close as possible everybody
seems to have the same reason the news
wants it close because that makes it
more of a you know more of a TV show and
the uh pollsters want to
close
um especially if they think it's really
going to be close so that makes their
numbers accurate and the if anybody
wanted to cheat they would want it close
too so who gets to control it the
pollsters the news they control it so
the people who have the most incentive
to keep it you know
tight are they the brainwashers who are
making a
tight looks like
it all
right
um let see what else is
happening yeah looks like Trump's going
to avoid all the uh the bad stuff before
the election so all that
lawfare and somehow he managed to beat
or postpone all of it pretty
good uh MSNBC had a silicon investor on
Roger
mcnam who says that
uh that Elon musk's free speech is a
danger to National Security because uh
musk also runs SpaceX which has a
national security element to
it and he believes that uh that even the
people who were part of this uh tenant
job where the the Russians allegedly
influenced through a YouTube channel
that tenet was running uh says that Elon
Musk probably needs to be arrested and
put in jail for free
speech I'm just thinking about
that the MSNBC had a guest who looked
right in the camera and said that Elon
Musk probably needs to be in
jail for his free speech on his Free
Speech platform mostly because he might
say something that is misinformation
according to
them now the fact that that didn't get
you know fact checked by the host or
anything this is
so scary now you can see why Nal
ravikant has gone public with his
opinions about
lawfare if they put musk in
jail um for you any of these trumped up
reasons uh I I advise
against violence
but I don't know how you'd prevent
it you know at some point you've gone
too far but I I I keep telling you that
we're not at risk of a civil war because
nobody would know who to shoot like even
if you took out your gun and said I'm
done you know I've decided to take up
arms because things are going so
badly you wouldn't even know who to aim
aim at because what are you going to do
show your neighbor
yeah you wouldn't know what to do the
the situation is not like the South
versus the north there's no way to have
a civil war there's just nothing to do
and and you wouldn't even agree what to
do if you tried to organize all right
let's organize what do we do I don't
know who should we shoot I don't know
there's nobody nobody would make any
difference it would just make somebody
mad you'd go to
jail so um we're in a dangerous
territory
here um even Governor Whit Whitmer
according to the Daily wire she doesn't
believe the polling in her own state
which shows that keris with a solid lead
you know the kind of solid lead that
pretty much guarantees you would win if
it's true and she doesn't even believe
the polls she's she's the governor if
the governor doesn't believe the polls
should
you well uh the uh Starliner aircraft
came back with without its uh people
that it left stranded in the internation
International Space Station and it also
had some kind of a engine problem but
that wasn't enough to stop it now why do
they even send people up there if you
can if this thing flies
itself if the Starliner can fly back
home and
land just
automated why do we even send that any
people up there yeah aren't we at the
point where you could send only robot to
space and they could just do their thing
forever if you need a new robot you'll
send up some
parts I'm not sure why people need to be
there at all it just doesn't seem
necessary I mean we we might be a year
away from it would never make sense to
put a human in a little uh room around
the
earth anyway so because I feel terrible
I'm going to end uh early and I'm going
to talk to the uh people if you didn't
know that the dilbur calendar is now
available for pre-sale go to dilbur dcom
to see the link well you're finding out
now and pre-sale helps
me so uh selfishly if you buy it on
pre-sale then we have a much better idea
how many to print and it makes a big
difference in the cost structure and
planning so pre-sale would help me a lot
if you think the uh shipping costs are
high which they are
buy more than one as gifts it will make
your shipping seem much more reasonable
all right everybody I'm going to say bye
to X and Rumble and YouTube I'm going to
talk to the locals people a little
bit and we'll see what's
what
