foreign
good morning everybody and a special
Happy Thanksgiving
to all Americans and Canadians and
non-americans too will be thankful for
all of you
and today you've managed to blunder upon
or possibly cleverly planned to be here
the highlight of civilization itself and
I'm going to bend your brain so hard
today
oh yeah you better put a seat belt on
your brain
because I'm gonna be tweaking it a
little bit today and if you'd like to
get ready for this brain bending
experience the most awesome thing
commercial free that you've ever seen in
your entire life oh yeah it includes a
whiteboard I I wasn't even going to tell
you because I didn't want you to get too
excited too fast we've got to build to
it build up to it
the first thing you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
chalices dying the canteen Joe flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid lilac coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
special Thanksgiving sip is called the
simultaneous Thanksgiving sip today and
it happens now go
ah yeah holiday good
well I almost don't know where to start
because today was filled with
so much wonder and goodness in the news
that I can barely contain myself yeah
Good Times well let's just uh start with
a big thank you to locals for saving my
life this year
a lot closer to a factual statement than
you think you think there's a little
hyperbole in there but literally you
kept me alive
I don't think I could have gotten
through the pandemic without this
experience
I tried as hard as I could to give back
as much value as I could so that you
would come out ahead
that's one of my rules by the way you
want a good rule for life
here's probably the best
yeah maybe maybe the single best
advice anybody would ever give you
give people more than they expect
that's it you've heard that advice
before right
the only people who ever give you that
advice
successful people
how much do you want to work with
somebody who gives you more than you
expected
it just changes your old days like
really that's more than I expected yeah
oh plant over deliver
plant over deliver
all right so that's a sincere thank you
and uh
let's have another good year
um
Joy Reid apparently uh said some things
about Thanksgiving and called it out for
being fake news and propaganda
thank you MSNBC for taking our wonderful
holiday and turning it into garbage but
here's the funny thing
today's Thanksgiving
and today we will not be saying only
negative things about people I'll save
that for the rest of the year
today we're going to be good to people
and I would like to call out the Joy
Reed no matter what you think of her
political opinions
she's very smart
she's very smart
and she's also totally right she's
totally right Thanksgiving was designed
as a propaganda brainwashing operation
to impart
sanitize our ugly past of how we treated
the Native Americans and as she said it
she told her viewers on MSNBC quote the
Thanksgiving is built on this myth that
the indigenous welcomed their colonizers
with open arms and ears of corn
now that's pretty funny
because that's that's almost exactly
what I learned
that the Native Americans are like hey
hey we got company somebody get the corn
they're going to need corn
well that's sort of how I learned it not
exactly
historically accurate
so I have two feelings number one Joy
Reid you're totally correct because
Thanksgiving is the ultimate fake news
it's built entirely upon this this myth
of awesome people getting together and
maybe there was a little bit of it but
the the intention of it is to bring the
country together and create a narrative
that we can rally around and make us
better people
so it is fake news it is propaganda but
it's a good kind
it's a good kind I'll put it in this
category of the Pledge of Allegiance
the Pledge of Allegiance is just
brainwashing
it's literally just propaganda
brainwashing of American citizens
for which I am totally in favor
that's the good kind of brainwashing
right you send your kids to school if
the school does a good job we won't talk
about you know the bad Public School
System but if they do a good job
they're brainwashing your kids
but in a good way hey you should work
hard
they don't learn that like I just tried
to brainwash You by saying you should
deliver more than people expect
I'm definitely trying to influence you
so you know influence and brainwashing
is everywhere all the time but some of
it's good
and I think Thanksgiving is a great
example
of turning some horrible history
into maybe some positive you give some
people give people an excuse to just
feel thankful for a while it's good for
us
all right here's a robot logic test
are you ready here's your use your test
to see if you can objectively look at
this story
without your robot bigotry that you will
bring to it okay
story is the San Francisco police
department has proposed a new policy
that would give robots the license to
kill humans
now you might say to yourself I would
need more information about that story
it feels like there might be some
important details that are left out of
the initial reporting the important
detail being
it's not an autonomous robot
it's a robot that somebody's like
steering and controlling the robot's not
deciding to kill people
come on we don't have those robots
and this and if a person is uh is
controlling the robot and telling it to
shoot and where to shoot
isn't that just a gun
basically we just defined a fancy gun as
a robot
it's just if a person is telling it to
shoot and then it shoots it's just a gun
that's all it is it's just a really
fancy one that has you know a remote
site and they can move around without
you touching it but it's just a gun
now how many of you immediately realized
that it wasn't really a story about
robots
not really it's just a better form of a
gun or a way to deliver a gun I guess
all right
um here's a challenge I did on Twitter
today I want you to see if you could
summarize the year 2022
in the snarkiest
most cynical way
what's the snarkiest one sentence you
could say about the whole year
was my initial primer for this mine is
everything you suspected about
everything turned out to be true
doesn't it feel like that
does it feel as if everything you sort
of suspected
was exactly what was going on
now to be clear
many of you are in a different reality
than I am but in both cases
we we followed a reality in which the
thing we expected or suspected turned
out to be true your reality in mind
might be different
but we both found ourselves to be right
but in different realities they don't
match like your reality mind might not
match but we all got to feel like we
were right in the end
which is weird
all right uh here's some fake news
coming out I think about Foxconn and
China
have you seen all the video of what
appeared to be the Chinese government
cracking down on the workers who seem to
be trying to escape from their uh
coveted quarantine
have you all seen those videos or that
news story
it looks terrible right looks like the
government is cracking down on them and
it's they're trying to keep them in like
a little jail to keep working and stuff
well that might not be the story
turns out that might be an entirely fake
story don't know so I'm not going to say
I'm not going to say that the
that the story that calls BS on the
story is true but I'll let you know what
it is
apparently the real problem is they were
promised bonuses and then the company
reneged
on top of that they're also mad about
the the lockdowns but it was about the
bonuses
and apparently they solved it by
who working out some accommodation with
the bonuses
so it was also about the lockdowns that
was part of the story but it wasn't
really a lockdown story it was pretty
much an ordinary story of
you know company having a employee
problem
now I saw also a theory that Foxconn
always has to relocate and has over time
because they can only operate where you
can abuse your employees the most
so allegedly they were in a place where
as soon as it got more industrialized
you couldn't have this horrible company
in the middle of your nice place so I
had to move where there are even poorer
people who have fewer fewer uh you know
Health protections so that the thinking
is that China eventually will be too
modernized to actually accommodate a fox
gun and the fox gun will actually have
to leave China to find an even worse
country to operate in because their
business model requires that you not
have you know essentially safety safety
controls so they can't have that I guess
now that's that's somebody's version I'm
not saying that's true I'm saying that
you know that's being promoted as one
interpretation of what's happening there
I have no idea what's happening in China
just as a general statement
all right
um
I did a poll on Twitter which is of
course highly unscientific
and I asked if uh how many people have
rejected advice from their own doctors
since the pandemic
right how many people have rejected
advice from their own doctors since the
pandemic
now famously you know I have and each
time I rejected my doctor's advice
I did well
I am not recommending you you reject
your doctor's advice can I be really
clear about that
I am not recommending
that anybody ignore their doctor's
advice but we can talk about it right is
that fair if I talk about it it doesn't
mean I'm recommending it just be clear
about that
um two-thirds of the people who answered
of course it's a it's a biased you know
unscientific poll but two-thirds of
people said yes
that they had ignored their doctor
I even ignored my veterinarian
I ignored my veterinarian and my doctor
on several very important things
I am currently ignoring my doctor who
ordered a full blood panel for me
do you know I am ignoring my doctor's
full blood panel
because I don't know why I need it
I don't have a specific complaint
if they if I do the blood panel do you
think it will find something that looks
suspicious
probably you know I'm at that age
do you think I should treat it
that's where it gets dicey what if it
finds something
and it probably will right oh your
kidney function is a little this or that
so you better take this pill do you
think I'm going to take that pill
probably not probably not
right yeah maybe you know two years ago
probably yes
probably yes but today
I mean I'm really really going to have
to have a strong strong argument to take
another
pharmaceutical product
it's going to have to be a strong
argument
here's the other one I've been on I had
been on asthma meds for 20 years
25 something like that and I I have two
kinds I don't use the emergency inhaler
because I just don't need it but there's
a kind that you use you know sort of a
baseline one to keep you healthy my
doctor looked at that and said
you know do you have any symptoms of
asthma I said no
because probably because I do this
Baseline thing every day and she said
you don't need that
unless you have symptoms and I said what
I've been taking this for 25 years
twice a day for 25 years she goes no
that's not really even indicated for
what you have
if you don't have any symptoms
and I said but if I stop taking this one
I immediately
have trouble breathing
and she said well if you do then use
your emergency inhaler and get back on
it
so I thought oh I'll try it
first time first day that I didn't do my
uh
regular asthma meds
um I couldn't breathe I couldn't get to
sleep I was like gasping for air and I
was like oh I really do need this
stuff
and I thought about it a little bit more
and I thought
I wonder if that was psychological
and it was I I just sucked it up and
tried it again put a little more effort
into relaxing
and now it's been awake without the meds
and I breathe perfectly
I can run up and down stairs my my my
exercise routine is actually the best
it's ever been
you know have the best muscle definition
of my entire life at age 65.
I mean I'm I'm just not sure that
I don't know what's going on
with with health care but it's pretty
sketchy now here's the payoff for this
remember we were all confused about why
the Baseline deaths are so high and some
people say it must be the long coven
and other people say no no it's the
treatment for the long cover this is the
vaccination
that's what's that's what's hurting
people
but allow me to add a hypothesis to the
mix
the hypothesis is that people stop
taking medical advice
and maybe some of it was essential for
them to stay alive
because I don't know what I'm going to
do when I reach a situation where the
doctor is right
because it's going to happen eventually
right like I I can't keep getting lucky
and overruling you know a trained
Medical Professional with Decades of
experience I'm not going to be right
every time
you get that right
even though it appears that I have had
extraordinarily good success finally of
you know making decisions that that you
know opposite of let's say medical
science even though I believe I've done
it totally successfully up to this point
I feel like the next one could be the
one that kills me
right the the very next thing I refuse
to do might be the one that kills me so
I can't I can't make a recommendation
that you ignore your doctor but I will
say this
we should at least be open to the
hypothesis
subject to testing that maybe people
stop listening to good advice
is that a thing
what do you think I think the Baseline
death thing is going to be a combination
of several variables it's not going to
be one thing but that might be one of
them might be I don't know
all right
uh Elon Musk continues to entertain
remember he found that big closet full
of t-shirts for Twitter employees that
said stay woke
and we all had a good laugh that you
know their closet was full of them well
apparently musk is taking it to the next
level
and he's created he's created shirts
that he's selling I don't know on the
Twitter store I don't know where he's
selling it but instead of uh
uh stay woke it says stay at work stay
at work
how could that be funnier
it would be impossible for that to be
funnier that's just perfect
um
all right
um remind me on the locals platform
and then I'm going to tell you some
behind the scenes stuff that I can't
tell the YouTube people okay
so when we get to the end of the live
stream
um I'm gonna go private on locals but
remind me that the topic is
cybernetic intelligence that's the topic
all right it'll be a little behind the
scenes stuff for you
um
all right what else is going on
um
so here here's the most mind-blowing you
thought it was true and then it turns
out it is so musk is saying
um musk asked should Twitter offer a
general amnesty to suspended accounts
provided that they have not broken law
or engaged in egregious spam
and I answered a lot of people were
giving him advice which I loved I mean I
just love watching
people give musk advice that affects
Twitter
because musk has determined that Twitter
itself operates like a brain
do you see how he's using it he uses it
the same way I use the my live stream
especially at the locals platform I use
the locals platform as my auxiliary
brain
like any question I have I just put it
out there and there's somebody who knows
the answer it's way better than Google
it's way better than the experts
sometimes
and and musk knows that too he said it
he said it directly that Twitter is
operating like a big brain and now he he
asks the big brain what should I do
and then the big Twitter brain tells
them now he still makes the final
decision but my God
my God watching you know the the richest
guy in the world arguably the most
successful engineer without even being a
trained engineer uh watching him create
or actually take advantage of
um Twitter as a brain
and then using that brain as part of his
business process
we've never seen anything like this
this is all next level
kind of like management it's like it's
like management from the future or some
damn thing I mean this is just insane to
watch this happening but
um my advice for him was this that if
you're going to do a general amnesty for
these suspended accounts the single best
time in the world to do it would be
Under New Management
there will never be a time that's more
perfect than that why because you don't
want to set a precedent
the biggest problem with bringing
somebody back is a crisis this ugly
precedent of well I guess I can do
anything I want because I'm coming back
but if you say once only
you know because we're redoing Twitter
it's Under New Management once only
we're going to give a general amnesty
this this is never going to happen again
people would believe that
I think if you said it's because of a
new ownership and also the product is
being revamped people say oh that's a
once only
I'll take advantage of this one only
time so
whether or not he
he lets everybody come back I don't know
I don't have a prediction about that but
I'll tell you that if he decides to do
it
it's now
like would you agree
that if you're going to do it this is
the time to do it period
so that's all I could add to the
conversation yeah this is the time
but I don't know there might be some
people that are just way over the line
now
um
let's talk about two movies on one
screen
back in 2016 or so I coined that phrase
because I saw that Trump was creating a
situation where we'd we'd bifurcated
reality into two completely different
realities and I saw that coming early
and I said we're living in multiple
realities at the same time we're looking
at the same stuff the same screen but
what I see on that screen isn't what you
see we're just in our own realities even
though we're looking at the same stuff
now the way most of you have
traditionally interpreted that
is that if people disagree what's true
it could be that both of them are wrong
but usually you're trying to figure out
which one is right and which one is
wrong
that's the general view of the world
that is not however my view of the world
I don't live in your world
I'm going to see how many I can bring to
my world and by my world I mean my
interpretation of reality itself
thank you
all right do you remember when the other
day uh we hit we watched reality
bifurcate in real time it's when I did
the simultaneous sip that I do before
every live stream and many people said
hey you forgot to do it
and then other people who were here at
exactly the same time watching the same
thing said yes you did
and then you can see people were quite
sure
that their reality was right and the
other reality was wrong now
your interpretation of this situation is
one of those groups was correct and one
of those groups was incorrect can I
confirm that
is it your view
that maybe you don't know who is correct
but you would say somebody was correct
and somebody was incorrect because it's
binary this is a yes no it either
happened or it didn't happen
that's it right and now that's your
normal view of the reality is it it
either literally happened or didn't
that's not my reality
I do not live in the reality where it
was either true or false
which will take a little explaining
all right here's here's my reality in my
reality there was this event that
triggered two or two different worlds
so we split into people who were sure it
happened and people sure it did not
happen
as long as
there's never a requirement that we
agree
we can live in those two different
worlds forever and there's not a
preferred correct one
here's where I'll make you crazy you
might be aware that Einstein once said
there's no preferred Observer
so if you're trying to understand
reality Einstein says well if if you
were traveling at the speed of light
reality would look one way and would
actually be that way
if you were not traveling at the speed
of light reality would look different to
you and would actually be different to
you
right there's no preferred reality
that's Einstein that's not me
Einstein said you can live in your own
reality
depending on the speed the angle and how
you're observing there's no preferred
reality
and I'm going to tell you the same thing
that this thing you think is a truth
that one of these happened and one
didn't
probably nothing happened
that's the world I live in the world I
live in where is like a user interface
all right so here's the analogy and then
I'll take it back to the real world if
you're using a computer and you click on
an icon you don't actually know what the
icon's doing it's moving zeros and ones
in a way that you trust will get you
something you predict but you don't know
what's happening you only know you get a
predictive a predictable result
my view of reality is that there are two
things that you can know
and that's about all you can know one
you can know you exist
because you're asking the question
two you can know there's some things
appear to have consistent predictive
results to you and I say up here because
you can't be sure the only thing you're
sure of is that it appears that way
you're not sure it's true
you're just sure that that's your
impression so the two things you know is
that you exist
and that you have impressions of things
that's it
everything else is mysterious
so here's the world I live in
and this will sound so weird
that most of you are going to lose most
of you in the world I live in
there was no simultaneous sip
the simultaneous sip was like an icon on
the screen
and you saw the icon but you didn't know
the reality of it the reality of it
could be that I'm a three-headed lizard
from the planet
slurb upon
and I was thinking a metal spike in my
ear
and then maybe for other people
they were watching an empty screen
but they were imagining I was there who
knows so what I'm saying is that
something happened
but the people who say it happened
didn't see anything real that's just the
icon and the people who say it didn't
happen also did not see anything real
they only saw the icon
so this can all be this can all work
within our reality as long as
there's never a requirement that the two
realities solve
and there isn't
those two realities never need to solve
now you say to yourself and Scott
you just have to go back and look at the
video
and then solve it so what happens if
somebody goes back and looks at the
video
well the most that they'll find out is
that their icon level user interface
Reality Part maybe they'll say oh I
guess I guess I just missed it
so you would you would rapidly explain
to yourself why you were in the wrong
reality but then you would think oh I
went from being wrong to being right
but probably not
the way I see reality is you went from
one thing you didn't understand to
another thing you didn't understand
but maybe one of them was more
predictive
that's it
or at least it feels more predictive
that's all you know is that you exist
and it looks like some things are
predictive that's it there's nothing
else you know so you live in a world
where it was either true or false that
there was a simultaneous sip I
permanently live in a world where the
question doesn't make sense
all I know is I was pushing icons that's
it
all right
um
so let's talk about this Balenciaga
story I so wanted not to
talk about this story
I'm really really trying to not talk
about Mass murderers or anything with
children right I just try and like I
just try to avoid it
um but the story became too
Fantastical I mean I can't avoid it
anymore
and here's what we know
but there's probably more we don't know
than what we know so Balenciaga a big
fashion brand that worked with Kanye and
dropped him because of his recent
comments they did advertise in campaign
in which uh children were shown with
teddy bears that looked like they were
in you know bondage attire and then
other other photos not the same one with
the Bears I guess but other photos that
Balenciaga had have documents in sort of
a on a desk that seemed to indicate
some kind of message about
you know illegal underage sex or
something so there's a court case now
there were some other like little
indications that valenciaga's got some
Badness going on now the question I
asked is well why hasn't somebody just
talked to the people who did the photo
like why are we listening to the
executives of
Balenciaga who by the way apologized and
they said we never should have paired
children with these products
but there's still a lot missing right
now
so I said why can't we hear from the
people who did the photo
and then people on Twitter because
Twitter is a big cybernetic brain
immediately corrected me and said we
have we have he's already issued a
statement so here's what the
photographer said
the photographer said uh hey hey I'm I'm
just the guy who makes sure the lighting
and the
you know the the photo is good it's the
brand that tells me what to photograph
I'm not the person who chose the teddy
bears
so he's in the clear right
photographers in the clear
because the photographer was not in
charge of what the photo was it was just
pushing the button to make sure the
lighting was good right
so I had this conversation uh with
another photographer who agreed with
that photographer and said that
this other photographer said well I too
have done many photo shoots including
Brands and what is a brand you actually
don't get to choose what you shoot
is the brand so the brand hires you they
say here's my product take a picture of
this thing
and then you know you can control the
lighting and stuff but basically you're
just doing what the brand tells you to
do
and Now ladies and gentlemen I would
like to
tell you about something I've never seen
before this is the greatest thing that's
ever happened in the history of social
media you may never see it again I don't
want you to miss it and maybe it's a
special Thanksgiving Story the greatest
thing anybody's ever seen on social
media
I changed somebody's mind
the have you ever seen that actually
changed somebody's mind
what so the photographer who said
um
who said that
I actually not get a photo that
um so I tweeted back
and said uh
now I I've done lots of photo shoots
maybe hundreds so being being the
Dilbert guy
for years and years every two days
somebody would say can we do a photo
shoot and put you in some publication
and I would say yes because it was all
good publicity so I know a lot about
photo shoots right some of you have been
in one or two
but I know a lot about photo shoots and
uh and here's what I said I said that
the uh the photographer is the captain
of the ship
yes the brand says we'd like you to hire
you to do this but once you're in the
room
I said the photographer is the captain
of the ship
now that's been my experience
but this photographer argued and said no
the the brand tells you what the shoe
you just push the buttons and make sure
the lighting is right
and
so I
um
So I responded and thank you somebody at
locals posted it for me so I could read
it for you so I responded I said you'd
shoot child porn for a paycheck
and I said let me defend you before you
answer no you wouldn't you would not
you're a citizen before you're a
photographer and here's the funny part
have you ever seen anybody just agree
with you on Twitter
so after I said that you chewed child
porn for a paycheck let me defend you
before you answer no you're not you're a
citizen before your photographer and
then he responded with
his name is MJ uh Ryan carnate I guess
or reincarnate no that's not his name
that's his Twitter name uh but he said
uh I would not meaning he would not
shoot child porn for a paycheck he said
I would not of course okay you're right
I think the photographer should share
more of the blame here
you're such a good Persuader holy I
never thought I'd change my mind on this
and David boxing horn caught the
exchange and he notes that he thinks the
persuasive part of what I said was when
I said let me defend you before you
answer
now do you recognize the technique let
me defend you before you answer
what was the technique
the the technique was basically I'm on
your side
yeah it's basically you and I are on the
same side let me defend you here because
you you basically just said you wouldn't
you wouldn't say no to uh pedos
yes you would yes you would let me help
you out here
so uh but also the argument was pretty
solid right so he immediately gave to it
so here's what you need to know about
the the photographer the photographer
said I'm not the one who set up the
scene I just took the picture
but you're still a citizen
you you know maybe a parent I don't know
like I think there's an obligation
that's a little bit bigger than
photographer if you know what I mean so
I will take it as truth that the
photographer was not behind some
pedophile Rings probably not probably
not
but should the photographer have raised
an objection probably yes and I think
the photographer
you know maybe you should say that
directly because because the the person
who hired the photographer says it
directly the person who hired the
photographer says we should not have
done this
so it's easy for the photographer to say
yeah you know
I like I caught up in it totally wrong
on me
my bad I would accept that
would you
I would actually accept that because
people do
kind of get rolled into doing things
they don't want to walk you know some
it's just not not my day to complain
sort of thing
he should have complained but I could
see a normal person making that mistake
that's not the worst thing in the world
now he also points out that he had
nothing to do with what was on the set
that's probably true
right so the the photographer doesn't
necessarily bring the props that would
be the brand people more more often than
that
and some might not have yeah and some
other photographer took the picture that
those sketchy documents on it now here's
the second thing
why would somebody leave these obvious
Clues
in a photo shoot
let's say it wasn't the photographer who
did it but somebody did somebody
involved in the Senate why would
somebody do that
I can see two possibilities
one they're part of a large grouping
ring and they're Suddenly at the signal
and you're making it safe for everybody
something like that
but here's the other possibility
it was a whistleblower
it was a whistleblower
that could have been a cowardly
whistleblower who said you know what
I I can't I can't blow the whistle on
this is too dangerous but I'll make sure
somebody knows
I'm just gonna put this right here if
you don't see this that's on you
now if somebody says it could be a
practical joke Maybe
maybe I mean that would be
a horrible practical joke but
could happen I mean it's not impossible
could be somebody who liked uh Kanye
more than they like this company
right it could be employee sabotage
employee sabotage right somebody who's
simply like yay and didn't like what the
company did and said all right well see
if you like this
yeah
so I wouldn't assume that uh balenciago
is guilty of any you know major thing
that that
that's not an Evidence
but I wouldn't clear them either
because I don't think their response
um goes to why there were so many
indications
it's one thing to say we shouldn't put
kids in an ad but they they dealt with
one variable when when the conversation
is multiple variables so yeah there's
more to there's more to know here now
I have been uh never on the team and I
think you can confirm this I have never
been on the team that says uh the world
is run by a cabal of uh Elite pedos
pedophiles
right you can confirm I've never said
I've never suggested that's the case
right
ah
however
in the interest of fairness
however
let me point out that number one yes
there are a lot of signals that are
starting to look very suspicious
a lot of signals does that mean it's
true nope no matter how many pieces of
confirmation you see confirmation bias
is still more likely
still more likely
however if you would like to have a
little bit of comfort in your view which
might differ from mine allow me to help
you out
here's the best argument
for the existence of a pedo Elite
running the world
follow the money
that's it
a less fall of the money doesn't work in
this and only this situation because it
works everywhere else
follow the money should give you the
following situation and I'll explain why
if you assume that Epstein's Epstein
Island was a blackmail operation
you mostly believe that right
don't you all understand that as
probably a blackmail operation
yeah most people believe that now I
don't know that it's true but let's
assume it is
now let's assume also that billionaires
like to fund politicians they can
control would you agree with that
uh billionaires who want to fund
politicians have a strong preference
for funding ones they can control
what would be the most valuable
politician for a billionaire
one that has some blackmail
you know working against them
so in theory
follow the money as long as blackmail of
political people is a real thing I think
Epstein shows it is
and as long as billionaires fund the
people they want to control
you should eventually get to the point
where only pedophiles and sexual
criminals are running things
because the pedophile the billionaires
would make sure they only had people
they could control
in the highest rings of government
because
let's get rid of this Calvin
Johnson doesn't even sound like a real
person
goodbye Calvin you were worthless and a
piece of Happy Thanksgiving
um
yeah so I'm so just to be clear if I get
taken out of context I'm not saying that
there is a uh Elite pedophile government
entity
I'm just saying that if you believe
following the money gives you good
predictions it does predict that we'll
have that eventually if we don't have it
now
we should be heading in that direction
and I don't know what the argument
against it would be can anybody think of
a counter argument
either follow the money works
or it doesn't
and if it works
we're heading toward a black Mill only
government and maybe we're already there
maybe we're already there
their live Fashion Show is all the same
theme yeah
well
um
I don't know
the you know there's something that
happens with fashion that doesn't happen
other places do you remember when uh
heroin heroin Chic was the look that
they were all trying to get on the the
runway
like women who look like they literally
were heroin addicts that was a thing for
a while and I don't think that that
meant that the fashion industry was
promoting heroin
like I think they actually treat it as
just a fashion statement
so I would not rule out
that as upsetting and uh
you know let's say as big as the signal
looks I wouldn't rule out that the
fashion industry doesn't see it
because the fashion industry has always
been a little suspicious about how they
treat underage people right wouldn't you
say that sort of a general theme that
runs runs across the fashion industry
the the
say the exploitation of the young
so I feel like it's just so much in the
DNA of the fashion industry that it's
not it's not shocking that one of them
would get would you know cross the line
and not even know it like just be
completely unaware oh two normal people
this is too far
don't you think that the fashion people
don't interact with normal people too
much
they probably interacted with people who
said oh yeah that's edgy and
you know that that works and
so there are still other ways to explain
what we see that does that do not
require an elite pedophile ring of
people coordinating
you just can't rule it out can't rule it
out
um
I live in a world where it's true and
not true at the same time
I feel like somebody could run for
president
um under the slogan of
making Health Care
follow science
and you wouldn't even have to explain
what that meant
but but imagine a presidential candidate
saying look this has never really been a
topic of of polit of politics before but
I guess it needs to be
let's make let's make Health Care
subject to science
now
let me do a little test for you
let me promise you
that I'm not going to talk about the
effectiveness of Max masks or vaccines
can we agree not to do that
so I'm going to be in that domain but
I'm not going to say whether they work
or don't work because I believe that I
believe that neither is true
I don't think it's true that they work
and I don't think it's true that they
don't work I think we're operating at a
user interface level
and that's it
maybe maybe there aren't maybe bats
don't even exist I don't know so
but I'm just making the narrow claim
that it let's say Trump or somebody else
DeSantis or somebody if they ran and
said look we're going to have to fix the
Public's Trust of Health Care science or
science in general because there's
climate science as well if you just said
we're gonna I'm gonna do what we can to
make science more credible
now I don't know what you would do
maybe it's information
and then let me ask you this this would
be a good test
how many of you believe that the and
again I'm not going to argue what's true
and not true I'm only going to ask you
what you've seen right it's not it's not
an argument about the science how many
of you
have seen a collection of studies saying
fast face masks do not work go
how many have seen at least one study or
maybe a collection of studies that say
face masks do not work
lots of yeses yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes
all right tons of them and even the ones
who have now seen them you're aware that
other people have right you you know
that lots of people have seen those
studies okay all right now I'm going to
give you a second and stop answering
this question
I need you to stop answering this
question so that I can ask you the next
one and they don't get confused okay
so stop answering that question for a
moment
I'll give you a little time lag here now
thank you
um
now how many of you
have seen the collection of studies that
prove face masks work against covet not
just one but like a collection of them
how many of you have seen them
a lot of yeses okay now you're
surprising me on locals locals people
have seen more there are more no's
now those of you who have never seen
that
you've never seen an entire collection
of studies that all indicate Mass work
you've never even seen it
do you believe it exists
if you've never seen it do you think the
problem is you haven't seen it or that
it doesn't exist
this is going to be hurting some of your
brains let let me tell you something
that I know
there's some of you have not experienced
right since I've always been open to the
question
right I've had some opinions but won't
get into them I've always been open to
the question of well I could be totally
right or I could be totally wrong so I
wasn't really too married
to to a view on face masks and so I've
seen because I've asked for it I've seen
vast lists of proof that masks don't
work
and I've seen just as persuasive
a large list of studies proving it
totally does
if you haven't seen both
then you're not informed
is that fair
now I'm not saying which of the studies
are Dependable because I don't think any
of them are my my opinion of all of the
studies is that they're all bad 100 bad
I don't believe any of the studies none
of them not not either directions don't
believe them at all
but if you've never seen
that the other side has as much
credibility in their studies as your
side whichever side you're on the other
side is just as armed did you know that
how many of you knew and again I'm not
saying who's right or wrong did you know
that the other side from you
has just as good evidence
now you might say oh those are bad
studies and mine are good you don't know
we don't know what a good study is
sometimes you can find a bad one but you
can't tell if the good one is really
good yeah
is anybody's mind blown
by learning for the first time right now
because I think you believe me right I
think everybody believes me I have seen
it and there are other people who've
seen them too but
is everybody's mind blown that the other
side from you has just as good
information
scientific information
I guess nobody's mind is blown by that
you all expect it I guess
yeah well
um in a related story that uh shooter
who shot up the uh
I guess the club queue which is lb LBGTQ
kind of a place
and it turns out that the shooter's
father
was a porn actor named dick Delaware
dick Delaware
which is weird because I thought that
was Hunter Biden's porn name
wasn't Hunter Biden dick Delaware
I mean if he wasn't he should have been
he should have been
well that's all I had to say about that
you really need to see the video of the
shooter's father
uh talking about his anti-gay
uh opinion and how he raised his son to
favor violence for solving problems
I think we found the problem
uh he was actually raised to be this
kind of guy
okay
that's that's pretty bad
[Applause]
all right um
the oh I forgot to mention this that
poor photographer
who is innocent until proven guilty
can we agree on that that the
photographer for Balenciaga
is innocent until proven guilty which is
separate from the question of whether he
should have stopped it
yeah he's innocent until proven guilty
so I'm going to treat him as innocent
because I actually think he probably is
made a bad call about whether taking the
picture but you know that's just a bad
call
um
but he had a earlier tweet I guess in
July of this year that is being
interpreted in two opposite ways so
which say we'll see which way you
interpret this
his tweet was it was something about gun
control and he said
um why was in a tweet he said why you
restrict child porn but not guns
that's why he said why restrict child
porn but not guns
is he saying child porn should be
restricted or child porn should not be
restricted
it's
a little unclear isn't it so
confirmation bias
is driving people to believe that he he
tweeted in favor of of pedos
Nobody Does that he did not tweet in
favor of pedophilia that did not happen
I'm sure somebody's done it somewhere
but he didn't do that no it was against
gun can it was against governorship
he was just saying that they should they
should both be banned
if you think he was pro-gun then it
looks like maybe both should be legal or
something but if you if you read that
tweet as being a pro
pedo
I think that's on you all right
there's a story I don't have a
confirmation on was it true that the
Club Q that got shot up I had advertised
it was going to hold in all ages drag
show the next day I saw that on Twitter
is that confirmed
because that feels a little too on the
nose doesn't it
is that a little too convenient
or was it actually there isn't
because it could have been the reason
because here's the thing why wouldn't
you shoot it up
oh the kids would be there the next day
does that make sense I was gonna say you
should attack the event not the not the
place that advertises the event
um
I don't know that doesn't sound I'm
gonna still say I don't believe it
it could it could well be true but I
feel like I need more more reporting on
that to believe that one
um
and then Tim Poole is getting in trouble
for he tweeted this we shouldn't
tolerate pedophiles grooming kids and
they that he says Club Q had a grooming
event referring to what I just mentioned
and then Tim says how do you prevent the
violence and stop The Grooming
like how do you talk how do you talk
Against The Grooming
without causing a crazy person to do
something like this
and and then people are trying to cancel
Tim Poole for saying that to which I say
isn't that that's the question we're all
dealing with isn't it
aren't we all grappling with the exact
question that Tim Poole just asked why
in the world is he getting canceled it's
literally exactly what you're thinking
he just said it how loud
like how did he get in trouble for that
yeah the whole point is it's it's
difficult to separate your criticism
from the fact that my activated crazy
person and that's true of a lot of a lot
of different topics you know if you say
if you say those darn Republicans or a
bunch of fascists does that cause some
democrat to hunt a Republican
yes
yes it does should you not be allowed to
say your opinion
well
that's another problem
so I feel like we just have to live with
the fact that if you do a fair criticism
of something that deserves to be
criticized
somebody
somewhere
can see that as an excuse for you know
Danger
so I think unfortunately just the cost
of a free system you know I don't know
what you could do about that
all right
um
ladies and gentlemen
that
brings us to the conclusion of the plan
part of my thing I'm going to tell the
local stuff some extra stuff is there
anything I forgot
that's in the news anything I should
mention
it's a 10 out of 10. I think so I think
so
um have you checked well I'm not a
turkey eater
when you when you don't eat turkey
um
did Dan Crenshaw really threaten the
cartels
um I didn't see any specific threat did
he do that
I I hope he did
you know when you see Dan Crenshaw
um threatened the cartels
that should be telling you something
because remember whatever you think of
Crenshaw and I know he got different
opinions about him as a politician
the one thing we don't doubt is that
he's you know a brave military guy
who seems to have a different
relationship with a risk and danger than
the rest of us do
and you might need somebody as Brave as
a Crenshaw to take on the cartels
because they would definitely go after
him
right so you need somebody with gigantic
balls
to even talk out loud about going after
the
the cartel
oh by the way on locals remind me to
tell you something else I can't say out
loud here
about the cartels
so you're going to remind me about the
cartels I'll tell you about that too
all right
Crenshaw is as tough as an old boot
that's what
uh Peterson says
all right I don't know if I'm going to
do a live stream today just to say hi
for Thanksgiving
uh whoa hello
Crenshaw introduces declaring war on
cartels act God I love the locals
platform because they can they can paste
a image in the comments so every time I
ask a question here's the exact answer
so let me read this this is from
Crenshaw November 16th
uh today representative Dan Crenshaw
announced the introduction of the
declaring war on the cartels act the
bill is designed to combat transnational
criminal cartels illegal activities with
increased criminal penalties and the
targeting of their finances
developed into the national security
threat okay well it's that's a different
definition of War
um war against their finances
is good
I'm all for it
but um it's short of what we need to do
now here's how I would do it
I've said this before I would not just
bomb a cartel operation
I would make sure they had a few days to
know it was going to be bombed right so
I think you do it the Israel way
where if there's a say a Palestinian
terrorist
Israel will destroy the family's home
but they tell the family to get out and
then they bulldoze it right they don't
leave the family in there when they're
destroying the home so I think giving
the cartel notice
so that they you can you know try to
avoid any collateral damage is the best
you can do they probably would leave
human Shields there and then you it's
War you're gonna have to do what you got
to do but I think you make them you tell
them that you know where their
operations are and you make them keep
moving the operation or else get bombed
it was at least disrupt it
now I saw something from a Twitter user
that I do not know is true
but maybe some of you do is there
anybody in the position who can confirm
the following thing
there's a heroin shortage in the country
and so fentanyl is all you can get
have you heard that
does anybody know
uh I saw a big yes in capitals so I I
know there's somebody around here who's
on heroin
unfortunately I have a big enough
audience that one of you is on heroin
and
somebody knows
that it and I I gotta I got an emphatic
yes on the heroin shortage so I've heard
it now from two sources
so if the if people are getting only
Fentanyl
there are two possibilities
that so there's a
there's a non-commonsense thing
happening with fentanyl that you need to
understand
if you don't know you're getting
fentanyl your risk of dying is a little
higher because you didn't know to take
care of yourself if you know you're
buying Fentanyl
and you're an experienced addict and
unfortunately most are experienced you
can actually take precautions
to make sure you don't take too much
or that you don't OD or that you've got
you know you've got Narcan nearby or
something like that so
people who are experienced
might actually have the least risk
so there's a possibility that the heroin
shortage
would make all addicts know they're
getting Fentanyl
if they're injected
and if you told all of the injectables
hey it's only fentanyl now would they be
would there be more death or less
I don't know there might be less because
they would know what they're dealing
with and they'd take the right
precautions if that's a thing I mean
that's I've been told by addicts that's
a thing but I suppose they there's got
to be some
huge risk in getting the right you know
the right dose no matter what
yeah
all right
um
see
um I'm being told that's not how drugs
work
uh speed lovers want to speed downers
lovers want down well that's I don't
know if you're talking to me but if you
can't get heroin
you'll take Fentanyl
you're not going to switch to weed
so I'm not going to argue at that point
that's just true
yeah and here's my final opinion on
Ivermectin you ready
my final opinion on Ivermectin is
it doesn't exist
the Ivermectin is just a user interface
icon
and below it it neither Works nor
doesn't work
that there's just some reality that's
mysterious to us but at the user
interface level
we can't decide
but below that level I think it's it's
neither true nor untrue it just doesn't
exist
now I'm not I'm not expecting anybody to
adopt my point of view
but here's what I mean by by it doesn't
exist
I believe that our Two Worlds that we
bifurcated the people who are sure the
Ivermectin has been proven beyond a
shadow of a doubt and the people are
sure it's been proven not to work beyond
a shadow of a doubt they both will live
complete lives
and they'll never need to decide who was
right those two realities will just run
forever
and they never they never need to
coordinate now by the way this is this
is my best evidence that we live in the
simulation
let me tie together two concepts the
biggest reason I believe we're in a
simulation is this stuff the fact that
we can bifurcate worlds and then live in
them and it doesn't matter
why if you were trying to program the
Earth
and write write code
it would be impossibly complex to make
sure that everything that changed
anywhere in that World
um you know sort of broadcasted its
effect to the rest so that everything
worked in a coordinated way it would be
too difficult to keep your life and my
life
separate but also never conflicting
right
you you would need to program it so the
conflict is explained away
and the way we explain conflict when we
have two different worlds and views of
what's true how does the simulation let
us explain it away without without
having to program to view them to be
compatible
it makes you it makes you believe the
other people are wrong
right as long as you think the people
who disagree with you have bad
information
or bad thinking you can just keep your
own your own view of reality
so you just make up a story that says oh
I guess those other people are wrong
about everything that's what they say
about you
so it would be easy to program a world
where things are not compatible
but all the people in it explain the
lack of compatibility Away by saying
well the other people are just dumb or
stupid or uninformed but if they do what
I do they would know what's true
once you see that the world is designed
to make us think it makes sense
when in fact it never can
then you realize you're in the
simulation
um
what is a simulation simulating probably
the Creator's world
you know if you take the Elon Musk view
that it's very unlikely where the
original species more likely were one of
the simulations that any species will
create at some point in their
development
um
we're probably some reflection of what
they look like you know the whole uh
we're designed in God's image
that might be true
you know our God might be some
human-like programmers who made us to
look like them because when they went
into our you know when they inhabit us
or use us to solve problems they want it
to be like them
that would make the most sense
all right I'm going to say goodbye to uh
YouTube for now Happy Thanksgiving
and I'll see you soon
