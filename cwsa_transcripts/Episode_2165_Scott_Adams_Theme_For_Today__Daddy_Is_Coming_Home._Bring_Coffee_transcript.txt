foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there has
never been a better moment in your life
and it's just going to get better for
the next hour or so and if you like this
experience to reach levels that nobody
even imagined were possible all you need
is a cup of micro glass a tanker jealous
of style and again teen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopa being the end of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
oh
delightful
um
well if you were a subscriber to Dilbert
reborn either on Twitter you can
subscribe just see my profile or on the
locals platform where you see lots more
than Dilbert
um you would know that today's comic
features the boss character
who forgets to roll down his windows in
the car wash
now I thought to myself
surely that's never happened to a real
person in the real world has it
well it took me about a minute for
somebody at locals to say that they had
that same issue it was just funny the
way they described it so gentlemen
rolled you know you know the car washes
where you put your car onto the
conveyor belt and then you just stay in
your car as it goes to the car wash and
all the Jets and stuff are shooting on
you until you're done
and he tells the story of you sitting in
the car wash you know you go on the
inside and he's sitting there and he
happens to look to it to his left and
notices that his uh driver's side window
is done he's looking right at a nozzle
he's looking directly in a nozzle that's
looking back at him bam
so again I guess he got facialized in
the car wash which to me is the funniest
thing I've ever heard in my life
just imagine that moment where you know
because you go to the car wash do you
think you've got you think you've got 10
minutes of not doing anything
it's like your brain goes into sort of I
guess I'll just be sitting here for 10
minutes mode I just imagine sitting
there just casually glancing over as
you're looking directly into the into
the face of a nozzle
anyway I thought it was funny
all right
today's theme is uh daddy's coming home
daddy's coming home that's the theme you
think it's about Trump it's a little bit
about Trump but it's bigger than that
so uh
and we'll put together a few stories to
make this theme today
uh so it's wait tweet on the Twitter
which is where the tweets are by the way
if you're going to look for a tweet go
to Twitter that's where they are
from David Ritter
and there was a news story but that's
irrelevant to the tweet and he was
replying to me and he says uh uh Society
don't need men
I don't need them to provide don't need
them to reproduce
um don't need them to survive
he says argue the merits if you want but
those are the facts
what do you think
do you think that this is a good
statement Society doesn't need men don't
need to this is said by a man don't need
him to provide produce or survive
what do you think
well I tweeted back at David
and I reminded him that this is 2023
. he thought it was 2022. it's well it's
an honest mistake it's not a mistake in
2022 you have to tweet things like men
are stupid idiots they they add nothing
to the world if they all died tomorrow
everything would be much better there'd
be no Wars and women would be designing
microchips like crazy
2022 am I right do you remember 2022
where you had to say the ladies could do
it better than the men
in everything
they don't need you for anything
no that was 2022.
in 2023 you could actually say uh you
know we would be living in agrarian
if we're lucky
lifestyle if
there have been only women
you get that right
there would be no real technology
no I get it there are plenty of women
who are great at technology can we take
a pause
all the people who are watching who
can't understand the concept of large
groups some have sometimes have members
within them that are not exactly like
the average did all of you know that
I I know because the people who don't
watch this live stream they don't know
that just go to Twitter you can find out
they think that if a few people were
dangerous during the protest it's called
a revolution
that would be an Insurrection so if
there's a lot of people who are just
protesting but a few of them are you
know actually want to overthrow the
government then the whole thing is
called the insurrection
right that's what the idiots
who think that they're helping think so
we don't need them here so if so if
you're in the group of people who thinks
my god did you just did you just say
that women can't do technology
no
nobody said that
nothing even similar to that
right I did say that if only women exist
there would be no technology industry
which is true but you couldn't say that
in 2022
2023
Free Speech I can say anything I
want and the replies to the men
and the women in this case
just so you know
anyway so let's get that 2022 thinking
out of there uh men could actually do
things
men can do things I know it's surprising
I would like to tag on to that thought
with uh you're watching the Jonah Hill
story Joni Hill
told his girlfriend in a text message
with that became public
that he had certain expectations of her
and if she did not meet them he did not
want to be her boyfriend no hard
feelings and the expectations were
mostly around time that she would spend
with other men Etc mostly about that
and what did a therapist say when when
the therapist wanted to weigh in on it
um that the Jonah had demonstrated a
lack of respect for his girlfriend's
autonomy and individuality
and uh that his message is more about
restricting Sarah's Behavior to sue his
comfort levels and insecurities
rather than expressing his feelings or
needs in a healthy manner
um can I give you some advice
this is for the men this is just for the
men
couples therapy
any kind of couples therapy is designed
for the woman to be told she's doing
everything right
and for the therapist to tell the man
that he's a
that's all it is
and the reason for that is that no
therapist can say anything that a woman
would disagree with and still stay in
the business
but a therapist can disagree with men
all day long and it's fine
no problem so for the same reason that
sorry
for the same reason I say eventually all
shoe salesmen will be people with a
fetish
because free market if you let the free
market do its thing money will determine
what everybody does right you couldn't
be a therapist and tell women the truth
there's some 2023 Truth for you you
could not be a professional therapist
and tell women the truth you couldn't do
it not and keep your job now I have
personal experience with this I actually
had a couple's therapist in my first
marriage tell me directly it's basically
uh I can't have opinions
that was it I can't have opinions about
what I want or what's good or what works
for me what doesn't work for me just
can't
now do you think they tell women that
they tell women the opposite that their
feelings are important and their man's
an
for not giving them everything they want
right do you think Jonah Hill's life is
going to be improved if he takes this
unethical in my opinion the therapist
suggestion that he let his girlfriend do
whatever she wants
and if she wants to spend the day with
handsome Surfers
that's just her choice and if he's
insecure about that
if if she has some insecure if he has
some insecurities about his hot
girlfriend spending time with other men
well that's just some insecurity in his
part but of course this would be the
same if you reversed it right if you
went to the therapist and said
um Jonah basically he's gone for days at
a time but he travels with his
ex-girlfriend
what no they travel together
but they're just friends
that's okay right well why don't you
trust Jonah what well why can't you
trust him and let him have his autonomy
he told you he's not in love with his
ex-girlfriend he just they always go on
vacations what's wrong with that give
the man a little autonomy will you how
about a little trust why stop stop being
such a narcissist
and let him have a little autonomy go on
vacation with his girlfriend what's
wrong with that well no no therapist
would recommend that would they because
he's the guy
if you're a man do not go to a therapist
a a marriage therapist relationship
therapist regular therapist I don't have
an opinion
but the marriage counseling it's just
not a real thing
let me let me tell you for sure it's not
a real thing it's just somebody telling
you that the guy's an and the
woman is wonderful and she needs more
support
that's the whole game
all right
uh number next story is the Amish
allegedly According to some study
don't have chronic health problems in
kids like everybody else
so in the modern world people have all
these chronic problems from more heart
disease to asthma to all kinds of stuff
and we're told that the Amish children
do not have that number one
do you believe that's true
yeah there's the question is it true
do you believe it's true or is it too
right out of the nose
all right first the first thing I would
say is that I'm highly skeptical that
it's true
highly skeptical that it's true
but it might be
it might be I also don't rule it out so
I have no argument against it except
that all data is fake
yeah this is data the the set of all
data in the world is
and this is part of it might
also be true
but if you believe it because somebody
has a study
well that's on you so I'm not going to
believe it but I will talk about it
right
if it's true
there are almost too many different
reasons for it which is a problem isn't
it think of all the reasons that it
could be
it could be the food you know they're
not eatingly processed food as much
although I've heard people say they go
to McDonald's but I don't know probably
not that much so it could be the food it
could be the medications
perhaps they're taking less
pharmaceutical things do they have fewer
vaccinations
were they required now are are the Amish
required to get childhood vaccinations
I don't know the answer to that
somebody says no but I'm not sure that's
true
I'm going to guess it's true it feels
like it probably is so food's different
vaccinations different environment's
different they have less pollution
probably
um less technology
how much do you think these screen time
and you know the hunching over your your
screen makes a difference some I don't
know how much it has to do with you know
chronic disease but it can't be good for
you what about their social lives
what about their social lives
if I had to guess the average Amish
child has less stress
because they don't use social media and
they all address the same and none of
them are especially hot
I just threw that in there I don't know
maybe some of them are super hot I I
should I should not tease the Amish
because I'm sure I'm sure if you saw
somebody who ate only healthy food
let me take it all back right that was
just a joke
I wonder what would happen if you met
somebody who had only eaten healthy food
their whole life
and didn't have any weird Pharma
chemicals in them
here's my guess
you would think they were hot
because it would just look so freaking
healthy
because they all seem to have you know a
good body weight their BMI looks good
probably of good skin
probably you know got a tan because
we're working Outdoors
it might be exactly the opposite of what
I'm saying like you know maybe they're
dressed conservatively but maybe if you
met a young Amish person in person you'd
be like holy cow this 25 year old is
killing it I don't know maybe they can't
really say I don't know too many Amish
people
but
um here's some other things that are
different I would guess that the average
social life of a kid who's Amish is
fairly fulfilling
because they'd be with their friends all
day probably working they probably work
with them probably you know see them all
the time don't have social media don't
dress that differently
don't have different beliefs
they probably have really good social
apps
just guessing I don't know I mean if
anybody has no knows more about the
community than I do let me know but I
would think that the quality of your
social life seems highly correlated
with good health outcomes now I I
question that correlation because the
causation might be backwards but there's
at least some indication that maybe
social life
is implicated in your overall health
they also have more meaning
do you think you would be healthier if
you had more meaning in your life
that you know you woke up and you you
knew why you existed and you knew what
your life was about and you thought you
knew what the afterlife was about my
help
well at least your mental health
and what about being outdoors more do
you think the Amish just simply spend
more time Outdoors
I think so I don't know for sure but I
think so I mean even when they do
Transportation they're Outdoors because
they're sitting on top of a wagon right
well I guess they have some covered ones
but
I'm going to make a prediction
prediction time so you you've got all of
those reasons you have the vitamin D Etc
so you've got all of these reasons that
you could imagine
could be part of the big picture of why
they have less disease if it's true
remember I'm not completely sold that
the data is true but if it's true
lots of different reasons that could be
true
but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you my
prediction of the one I think is the
most underrated of all of these
and actually I didn't mention it yet
movement movement
I I I feel like here here's my
hypothesis
if your body's moving your body knows
it's moving and it gives you good health
in other words I believe that your your
body and your brain or all this one unit
that sees what you're doing
and then provide you the means to do it
so if you run if you run every day your
body will provide you with greater
Fitness so that that running is easier
to do
so basically your body mind or just
always conforming themselves to what
you're doing
now what if what if you were in the
modern world unlike the Amish and you
spent an amazing amount of time just
sitting here with your phone in your
hand
or in front of the computer just sitting
and you're just not even moving
what is your body going to think is
happening or what you need it's going to
think you don't need to be alive
I mean it doesn't see you looking for
reproduction it doesn't see you doing
meaningful work like your brain and your
body think you might as well be dead
because there's no point in you you're
just not part of the you're not part of
the useful world you just look at his
screens I think your brain just tries to
kill you because you're not doing
anything useful you're just sitting
there now I don't mean that as like an
intention of the brain but
here's my prediction
in the next five years there will be
major stories about the need to move
more
just not sit in one place because I
can't believe the Amish sit in one place
do you think so I mean when they're
tired they get arrested like everybody
but I don't think that they spend much
time just sitting in one place I feel
like they move a lot they're they're
working they're doing chores they're
walking to school they're taking care of
the horses they're just moving now
here's the reason I have this hypothesis
because I track and by the way I
recommend this for all of you forever
I've been tracking what I do during the
day and then how I feel
do you do that do you do you make a
conscious effort to say all right what
did I eat today
how do I feel I do that every day all
the time so I feel like I have maybe a
little bit you know little observational
Advantage just because I've been
tracking it and I will tell you that on
the days when I'm physically active and
I don't mean just exercise this is
important I don't mean formal exercise I
mean I you know clean the house organize
the garage
got ready get ready for a party
like do you ever have a day when you're
entertaining and you you wake up early
and all day long you're cleaning stuff
and organizing and buying stuff and
putting things out and then when you're
done you're putting it all back and it's
you know it's 1am and you've gone all
day
every moment of that day you've been
moving how do you feel
exhausted
and excellent
right you feel excellent
those are your best days when you wore
yourself out doing something that you
wanted to do which is have your friends
over right sometimes it doesn't even
matter it just could be cleaning your
garage do you know how many times I
reorganize my man cave in my garage
because of the activity of the doing it
it's about the doing is not even the
outcome although I like the outcome
so here's my big prediction five years
from now there will be major stories
saying that people aren't moving enough
and it's signaling to your brain not to
make you healthy
and if you simply move more your brain
would say well I guess you need more of
this
you need more of this healthy guy going
around doing stuff so I'll give you good
health
that's what I think now I do think
there's other factors that matter you
know the fluid in the farm and all that
stuff but I think movement's going to be
the bigger the bigger Factor when it's
all sorted out maybe food
would be the the other competitor
I can certainly see that being all of it
if it turned out that way
all right well uh next three stories are
about penises
um
Elon Musk has tweeted that he's
proposing a literal dick majoring cut
I'm probably reading this wrong I think
I'm probably reading it wrong let me try
it again Elon Musk is proposing a
literal dick measuring cup I am reading
this right uh the richest man in the
world has proposed a literal dick
majoring contest with Mark Zuckerberg
that's real news by the way if you're
not on Twitter
actually happened
yep did not make that up
actually happened now there's no word
whether Elon musk's mom has weighed in
uh you know that she did weigh in when
he was considering fighting with
Zuckerberg but this new contest uh the
literal dick measuring contest it seems
that his mom has been silent on it so
far
um
so there's that
I tell you this is the best summer
I don't think we've ever had a more fun
summer of just weird news because none
of it matters it's all news that doesn't
matter the good stuff now I saw I saw a
second part of this story
that I think is fake news but I didn't
have time to research it can you give me
a fact check on this
did Zuckerberg respond to that just tell
me if he responded
and then I'll tell you allegedly what he
said
did he respond to that because I I saw a
tweet
that was a screenshot so it didn't look
like it was necessarily real but I
didn't go to see if there's a real one
was that fake
all right well let's say we think it was
fake
so there's a fake response from
Zuckerberg but it was funny
meaning that it wasn't Zuckerberg it was
somebody pretending to be him I think it
would have been hilarious if you said it
but the answer was after uh after musk
had called him a
so musk tweeted yesterday Zuck is a
which by the way if you're keeping track
was a day after I'd said that Zuckerberg
can't run threads as well as as musk can
run Twitter
because Zuckerberg has to worry about
what his wife says
like literally
because his wife will say oh you can't
let those Nazis on there or you can't
let them do this or that he's got to go
home he actually has to explain what he
does during the day
to his wife
now when I say that I don't mean
literally he has to explain it it's just
the way things work
right there's no way that his wife is
unaware that he just launched threads
right of course she's aware and you know
she I believe she's Harvard you know
high-end you know very capable woman his
wife so of course she has opinions and
of course he takes them seriously of
course he does anybody would okay she's
she's brilliant and it's his wife and
I'm sure she understands
what threads is you know there's no
secrets to it so
you know I just made that observation
that he's he's uh Zuckerberg has to make
his shareholders happy
but also his wife
because he's a normal human being he has
nothing to do with even being Zuckerberg
whereas Elon
doesn't have to make his shareholders
happy on Twitter because there are none
and he doesn't have to satisfy a wife
because he's unmarried
so it's just an advantage anyway so
um uh musk called Zach a I don't
know maybe he was thinking in the same
terms as I was uh
but uh
so allegedly after this dick measuring
contest tweet allegedly Zuckerberg and
this is not real uh said that what was
the Tweet he said that his wife
says that he has the biggest dick among
the tech billionaires
and the joke was as if his wife would
know all the sizes of the other Tech
billionaires which was pretty hilarious
now if Zuckerberg himself had tweeted
that I would have think it was about the
funniest thing he's ever done
yeah I mean obviously you wouldn't do it
unless his wife was in on it but it
doesn't seem like his style so when I
saw it I was like that doesn't look real
and you're you're confirming it's not
real right for sure it's not real
I think I think you're confirming it
yeah
all right
um
so there's a desensis attack ad on Trump
uh which is accusing him of being too uh
pro-lgbtq
and apparently the ad is backfired so
badly that the DeSantis campaign is
disavowing any
you know any knowledge of it basically
they're saying it's not us we don't even
know who made this ad we don't even know
who did this I saw Mike cernovich
talking about this the the sad facade
the DeSantis campaign seems to be
failing pretty hard because here's the
problem
even though the attack ad on Trump for
being too as they say
pro-lgbtq and they give some examples
you know I guess he allowed something
like he allowed gay marriage at
Mar-A-Lago you know before that was an
ordinary thing so so Trump has a long
history
of being extremely friendly to the LGBT
community now that should be exactly no
surprise
anybody who anybody who's paying
attention knows that Trump has always
been friendly
to adults right adult adults who want to
live their own life any way they want to
he's always been friendly to that and
he's always been in that you know
high-end Hollywood world
where you're surrounded by the LGBT
community all the time
and you know people who are surrounded
by it you just it just becomes part of
your environment you don't think plus or
minus about it it just becomes part of
the context of your life so Trump is in
that category of people which maybe
you're not like if you're not if you
haven't experienced it as I have right
so I live in California
in Northern California outside of San
Francisco and I lived in San Francisco
for a number of years
do you think I have a problem with the
lgbtq community
no because it just becomes part of who
you are in your environment and you know
just it loses all of its
whatever makes it different from
everybody else it just loses it after a
while it's just what it is so if you
haven't lived in the community
where there's a heavy lgbtq presence and
this is important it works
it just totally works
do you think you know people are not
leaving San Francisco because the LGBT
community was pooping on the sidewalk
or or they had ramped up the crime you
know all that gay crime which
practically doesn't exist
so to imagine that to imagine that Trump
ever had negative feelings about the
LGBT community there's just no basis for
that at all and all evidence suggests
the opposite
so the census goes after him for that
which I think is a mistake but as
cernovich said
if you if you believe the statements in
this ad that you're disavowing
you know because they're they've got
some more lgbtq let's say
confrontational policies
um that you should say you agree with it
why are you disavowing something you
agree with which is a really good
question
if they agree with it even if they
didn't make it and even if it's a poorly
made ad do they agree with the message
why disavow something if you agree with
it
because they're not comfortable with it
now can Trump agree with it
can Trump say yes I did allow the you
know gay weddings at Mar-A-Lago before
that was popular
of course he can he could say yeah I did
that totally
yeah there's nothing he has to deny or
change he has nothing to explain he's in
a really good place so I think I just
don't think you can be
um as confrontational to the LGBT
community as DeSantis and expect to get
all the way into the the final final
competition I just don't think you can
do it does that feel like something
that's even possible in 2023
like it's one thing to go hard about how
children are raised
I think that's completely defensible
but as soon as you extend that into any
adult Behavior
yeah I'm out I'm out
hello I'm out don't leave my adults
alone leave my adults alone don't don't
take their weed don't tell them what
they could wear
but kids sure kids are fair good
all right
um
here's the least surprising thing in the
world which I predicted of course so
comedian and author of Sarah Silverman
and a few other authors are suing open
AI for copyright infringement
surprise all right now I didn't know it
would be this group of people but the
accusation is that open AI chat GPT it
went and read all of their books and now
if you ask it to summarize their books
it can
so in other words if a book exists
I may be oversimplifying this but I
think this is true you would never need
to buy it
because you could just tell AI to read
it to you
you never have to buy it because it
knows it already has stored in its own
database everything about the book once
it knows the book it's just like a
person
could I walk up to a person and say Hey
you read that book can you tell me the
like the main points of that book sure
well that's legal right a human being
can describe a book describe a movie
that's not copyright infringement
but if AI is the one who's talking to
you and the AI knows that book
can they tell you everything in the book
is that fair because it's a machine not
a person
what happens if it becomes conscious if
AI becomes conscious are you going to
tell it there are some things you can't
talk about oh you do know everything in
Sarah Silverman's book but if anybody
asks you can't tell them because that
would be a copyright violation do you
think that's going to happen
yeah it seems like you could super
prompt your way around that pretty
easily so I doubt they could get away
with it so I'm not even sure which side
I'm on
you know as an author
I should quite obviously be on the side
of the authors
on the other hand how do you police this
I I don't want the solution to be worse
than you know the disease so maybe
what's needed is authors need some other
way to make money
it could be that the business model of
protecting things by copyright just
won't work
it would be easy to imagine for example
that people like me can only monetize on
social media
in other words I can write all the books
I want
but everybody's just going to get them
for free through AI
uh and even the AI would turn it into an
audiobook if you want
you could be walking with your
headphones on and say hey AI uh read me
as if an audiobook Sarah Silverman's uh
latest book do you mean this title no
the one before that okay beginning
you got your audiobook
um Chad GPT can you change the voice of
the audiobook I'd like to hear this in
uh in the voice of some other actress
and then you get it how do you compete
with that how how is a physical book
going to compete with that get so it's
easy for me to imagine that it'll go the
way music went at least a little bit so
music used to be you could make some
money on the record but also by touring
but I think these days the touring is
most of the money isn't it because
streaming is ripping off the artist am I
right about that I'm not really
following it that closely
uh summer say yes some are saying no my
understanding is that if you're a big
musical act you pretty much had to tour
because the tour was the money
am I wrong
now that would be a change that made
sense because of streaming and illegal
ripping of music
so the musicians maybe had to change
their business model to do something
different
I can imagine that authors such as
myself for both comics and books
probably have to just change my business
model
I mean I think this is going to be up to
me to adjust and not for AI to be
illegal what do you think
let me ask you you're not most of you
are not authors what do you think is a
better world is it a better world
if the AI can do anything it wants with
the copyrights or is it a better world
if the authors maintain that control
because I will tell you for sure that if
I couldn't make money writing books I
wouldn't write any
would you agree there would be no such
thing as Talent Stacks or systems or
better than goals there are a number of
things I've introduced that have
literally changed America
in terms of personal success that I
wouldn't have written if they didn't pay
me right I mean I did it for social as
well as financial reasons that
particular book but I wouldn't have done
it for just social reasons because it's
so much work like you need to get paid
it's just so much work to write a book
it's just crazy
so I don't know could go either way if I
had to predict I think that the business
model for authors will change
for example yeah let's just take any
example if Andrew huberman had a book
does he
probably does right
does Dr Andrew huberman have a book
I don't know but whether he has a book
or not I'll use him as my example he
could have a book because you've seen
him on Joe Rogan he's always on social
media but he could monetize social media
a lot more easily than he could monetize
a book because he's good on social media
so I've got a feeling that authors are
going to be turned just turned into
podcasters
and just monetize it that way
that's my guess
all right
uh Vivek
ramaswamy is uh innovating on
fundraising so as you know the big
fundraiser raisers in politics are
packagers do they call them that so
there'll be some people who are like
super fundraisers and if you could give
some of them to work for your campaign
you're going to be super fundraising
yeah so I'm not sure if he's just
talking about the packs
but he's introducing an idea to let
anybody who raises funds for his
campaign
to keep 10 percent of it so you could
raise as much money as you want for
ramaswamy and everyone a bundler I'm
sorry a bundler not a packager it's
called a bundler
uh packager is a different business
I think packager is a book book word uh
so he's the bundlers but anyway the so
if you wanted to be a bundler for Vivek
you could get 10 commission and it would
be uh transparent everybody would know
10 goes to you
what's wrong with that idea
anything
is there anything so I saw
um I think Ian
miles John and some other people call it
a
called it a pyramid scheme
but you know it's not a pyramid scheme
right
so a pyramid scheme everybody who's
involved is trying to make money from
the people that they bring in below them
etc etc so each level is doing less well
than the level above them but that's
nothing likewise he's suggesting what
what Vivek is suggesting is more like a
sales commission that every sales force
in the world does
if you can you know if you can do this
amount of business you get 10 of it and
that's it
he's
let me put it this way
I didn't read the article
but do I need to read the article to no
it's not a pyramid scheme I mean really
sit see here's where you can use vivek's
intelligence
as a proxy for research right what I
should have done when somebody said it
was a a pyramid scheme I should have
looked into it to read the details right
normally you would do that but I skipped
that step
because it's Vivek right
are you telling me there's any chance
that he launched a pyramid scheme
really
you think he launched a pyramid scheme
right in public no no that would not be
what somebody as smart as him and as
capable as him as experienced as him
would ever do in a million years there's
just no chance he would ever do that so
I don't have to research it it's sort of
like
you know
does the government have 20 uh captured
UFOs
if I could research it I wouldn't
I wouldn't bother
all right so you don't have to bother
with that one
what else is going on uh axios has did a
story today on Joe Biden's temper behind
closed doors and the idea is that he's
uh he's just a swearing machine behind
closed doors and he says stuff like uh
gee damn it how the F don't you know
this don't effing BS me I'm trying to
clean this up for you
so he's quoted us saying stuff like that
and that he angers easily behind closed
doors and then his critics say it's
probably dementia
is it
is it dementia
okay I get it was the first thing I
thought too of course so I get the
dementia can cause outbursts I get that
I also get that he probably hasn't
in my opinion it looks like he has the
signs of dementia in my totally
non-professional opinion but is this
story Fair
is this a fair story if this had been
about Trump would you say oh that's
that's fair yeah he gets really angry
behind closed doors
I can't tell if this is a hip piece or
it's helping him
axios is it does pretty good job of you
know not being obviously in the bag for
anybody
uh probably everybody complains about
every story but they they do seem to try
to hit some kind of reasonable middle
opinion ground
and here's my first comment here's what
they left out
what's left out of the story
context
they left the context out
do we ever elect presidents who don't do
this
and who do you want one would you want a
president who didn't act exactly like
this behind closed doors I don't
I don't want that President no this is
the president I want
yeah maybe Jimmy Carter was not like
this Beyond closed doors but I'm pretty
sure most of our presidents were
most of our presidents got really really
angry and cursed behind closed doors
we're pretty sure of it right and
one of the things that the story says he
gets angry about is when he asks people
who are briefing him he asks insightful
useful questions and they can't answer
it
and he goes off on them does that bother
you
does it bother you if he goes off on his
staff when they can't answer his simple
questions nope
nope that may be like him
that made me like him a little bit
better honestly
and I'm of course worried that dementia
is part of the story but I can't believe
he hasn't always been like this
he looks like somebody may maybe always
could have had a temper Beyond closed
doors and I don't I don't judge him at
all because Trump was the same
um and all the presidents were the same
except maybe Jimmy Carter right
now maybe yeah
maybe JFK was
maybe a more polite version but I've got
a feeling he got pretty pretty mad
behind closed doors so the funniest part
about this is that somebody decided to
Brand uh Biden As Old Yeller Old Yeller
that's pretty funny
anyway nothing bad about that
also Biden would scold his advisors for
using you know big ivy league words in
their presentations and he would force
them to use regular language
that feel this feels like a love letter
to Biden to me
right because basically that's just
Trump
that's Trump don't use those words
explain it in real real words that
Ordinary People understand
yeah give me more of that very positive
for everybody
uh more dick dick news from Twitter so
the libs of tick tock got suppressed by
Twitter's algorithm and they complained
and showed a bunch of screenshots of
people who said they couldn't find their
account on Twitter and Elon Musk looked
into it and turns out they know exactly
why
the libs of tick tock had uh tweeted a
picture of let's see what was it the
pride parade or something
yeah from The Pride parades and there
was some nudity in the photos now even
though the nudity was maybe not part of
the photos we learned today from Elon
Musk himself that Twitter has a dick pic
bot
a dick pic bot which is exactly what
musk referred to it as his dick pic butt
in other words they have some kind of AI
that looks for dicks
is just looking for dicks all day long
it's like all it does
and when when the bot goes home to its
spouse but
and the spouse bot says how was work
today well had a good day I found uh 10
million dicks
got rid of them all
yeah so that's what happened and then I
must said that the correction is that
they should have been suppressed on one
tweet instead of the entire account so
he's going to fix it so we'll still have
a not a safer work message on the one
tweets or the few tweets that have these
images on the the account will not be
suppressed so today we learned that
that's a thing
apparently it would in the past one dick
pic would have made you suppressed and
you wouldn't have known how to fix it
until Musk
all right here's another one
um
there's a governor
he was on face Nation on CBS and he was
talking about his efforts to ban or
limit gender transition treatments yeah
so what was what do you think would be
the name of the governor
just guess I won't even tell you what
state what would be the name of the
governor who wants to limit gender
transition surgeries for minors
what would be a good name for a guy like
that
well his first name is Spencer
Spencer
his last name is Cox
c-o-x
so it's uh I'm not sure where you put
the emphasis of his name
but
it sounds like the spend
s her for a Cox Spencer Cox
so um
sounds like somebody's spending money on
her
I know this is what his name sounds like
it's probably a coincidence it's
probably not the simulation winky IU is
probably just a coincidence but one that
I think had to be mentioned
well China is having some deflationary
problems
now that's the whole story
I could put more words on that but in
other words their prices are are not
going up or not inflated like other
places but it could be a huge problem
so the reason China's prices are not
going up is that their business is not
good
so they're not making and selling as
much as they used to demand is low and
their prices are low so there's less
inflation in China now the good news
is that we're buying their products
still so that will keep our inflation a
little bit in check even though ours is
higher however the the deflationary
pressures
can be as devastating or worse
than inflation
so as we're worried about inflation I
saw Jamie dimon say this so the head of
uh
uh Chase Morgan what is it what do they
call themselves Chase Morgan or
something so
um having that big Bank
JP Morgan Chase thank you
so he was saying that the United States
has never been in a more privileged
economic situation
relative to the rest of the world so
everywhere in the world people have
their problems at the moment
economically but
we have this weird situation where we're
way better than other people right are
we better off than Russia
probably although that might be a
Breaking Point situation you know they
may be getting close to a Breaking Point
are we better off than China
maybe it looks like it according to
Jamie Diamond are we better off than
Europe
looks like it and better off than Africa
South America you could go on we seem to
be better off than every other country
at the moment
and we've also proven that unless China
has some good weapons
there's only one superpower
because Russia didn't really have a
military like we imagined they had
just didn't
so it's starting to look as if America
is stronger than it ever was relative to
the other countries
had you ever had you thought about that
at that crossed your mind that America
has reached basically a winning position
in the world even more so than ever any
time in the past
yeah I actually agree with everything
you said I agree with 100 of it and by
the way JB diamond is really good
he is really good
at being a public leader saying the
right things without too much you know
political spin he is pretty
good at not being a bullshitter
if he ran for office it'd be hard not to
like him
I don't know what his policies would be
but if you're just going to pick
somebody who is smart and capable and
doesn't seem to lie too much
I don't know he's looking pretty good I
wouldn't I wouldn't say no to looking at
him in the future as a politician I
don't think he's interested but
all right uh California has some
legislation uh in which they're making
it a requirement to consider race
in your sentencing
for the penal code
in other words now it's not okay it's
required
you should consider race when deciding
how much of a prison sentence to give
does that sound like a good idea
you should consider race
when deciding how long they go to jail
you should
now it sounds worse than it is
yeah of course it could be worse than
this it sounds worse than this here's
what they're trying to do
what they're trying to do is make make
sure that black people don't go to jail
for longer than white people for the
same crime are you okay with that
you're okay with that right
no complaint
right of course of course that's the
most basic Republican belief is that
everybody's got to be treated the same
under the law so of course everybody
likes that part but do you think this
legislation is going to get us there
maybe it might actually work I have
actually mixed feelings about this
because I very much don't want different
uh sentences for different races but I
don't think this is designed to make
white people go to jail longer
I think it's made to make sure that
black people don't go to jail for too
long I'm all for that
I'm all for that
we'll see
it just sounds worse because it's coming
from California where everything is
crazy
all right Michigan has passed the law to
make
it illegal to misgender somebody it'll
be a felony ten thousand dollar fine
now that's only if you do it uh
intentionally
and what's the other word and wrongfully
so you have to be incorrect in your
diagnosis in other words you're calling
somebody the wrong thing
but it also has to be intentional
meaning you're you're trying to be a
dick so it's like a hate crime
does that feel like a good law
does that feel like that'll work out
just really just the way they hope
how in the world do you prove that
they're wrong
imagine the the first lesson all right
you were wrong and you were doing it
intentionally taking you to court guy
ends up in court says all right uh
you're accused of being wrong
and being intentional about it and then
what it what does the defendant say
prove I'm wrong
prove I'm wrong
go ahead
prove I'm wrong
it's going to be whose opinion gets to
be right because if the let's say
there's a a defense let's say there's a
victim with quotes
so there's a victim who's been uh
been called the wrong uh to say gender
misgender it's called the wrong gender
don't they have to prove their gender
like wouldn't you have to prove that
it's wrong
like how would you prove that the person
who's defining themselves got it right
and the person who's observing got it
wrong
couldn't it be the other way around
couldn't The Observer be right
and the person who's self-identifying is
wrong now you could say that doesn't
make sense because if you're
self-identifying
that's the end of the story
the the gendering is about
self-identification
but is it
is it completely about
self-identification
if you looked and presented yourself as
a hundred percent male
but you said I want everybody to call me
she
would that fly
you didn't even pretend that you were
part of the other the gender you claimed
I don't know it seems to me you could
have a situation where the Observer is
right
am I wrong
you couldn't have a situation where the
Observer is more right than the person
who's identifying as whatever it is they
are
I think you could
so so I don't know how you could ever
like convict
and what if it's intentional but is not
meant for harm
what if it's intentional and the intent
is to make the world a better safer more
rational place
it just made one person unhappy
that's a crime
if your intention is to make everybody
better off
and very very directly that's your
intention to make everybody better off
protect kids
so how do you prove you had a bad
intention
yeah I don't think this law stands
because it's too vague too much too much
to argue about
and doesn't have enough benefit the you
know what's the old uh hackney'd say the
juice wouldn't be worth the squeeze
like I get what they're going for but I
can't imagine it's worth it you know
doing it this way the problems seem like
they'd be bigger than the benefits
well as you knew this would happen the
AI doctors are coming so Google is
competing as hard as it can against
Microsoft's AI trying to come up with
the best AI doctor
and one of them is actually was it uh
Google I think it's Google is actually
training it by having the AI take
medical
tests you know the same tests the doctor
would have to take to become a doctor
the AI is being trained on the questions
and the answers from those tests
so in theory
you could have a human Doctor Who you
know scored okay
on the medical exams or you could have
an AI you've got every question right
which one would you pick
so presumably a real human doctor could
pass those tests
with less than 100 accuracy right so
right it's probably like
70 percent or something does anybody
know the actual percentages to be a
doctor I don't know what tests we're
talking about but you probably have to
get pretty high in those tests I don't
think 60 is going to cut it right so you
have to get maybe at least 75 percent
I'd be happier with 90.
right but what if the AI gets 100 every
time
and the human doctors even the really
good ones are only at 90 which one do
you want for your doctor
the 90 of the hundred percent
now you might say but the doctor you
know is there in person
do you think the doctor could do a
better job of examining your suspicious
mole than the AI could
if you just you know hold your arm up to
the camera and say all right is that a
suspicious mole do you think the human
doctor is going to beat the AI
I don't think so
you say yes but I think I think the yes
is uh maybe a year old meaning a year
ago maybe but at the moment no I think I
think they've already tested it my
understanding is they've already tested
the suspicious mole test and the AI
already beats the humans I think that's
already done
right
all right
well I do imagine that we'll all have ai
doctors right on our phones the only
thing that could stop it would be what
what could stop it
the American Medical Association do you
know why we didn't have uh Telehealth
before the pandemic
what was the really good reason we
didn't have Telehealth you know doctors
on Zoom why didn't we have that before
the
is because the American Medical
Association
wanted it to be illegal to practice
across state lines
and if you can't do it across state
lines it's sort of a problem for that
business model right because you're too
limited by one state
so the AMA presumably to protect the
jobs of the doctors should come out and
tell you your AI is going to kill you
and if you don't have a human doctor or
you're all dead and and the data proves
it
so there's going to be a fight
but if the AMA is fighting against
Google and Microsoft
who's going to win
if you put up the AMA against Google and
Microsoft who wins it's Google and
Microsoft
am I wrong
I think they win every time
because they can they can control the
government with money in a way the AMA
wishes it could
all right
so now the story is that uh Putin
actually met with pagosian after the
failed attempted alleged coup
and that Putin met with 30 military
commanders and that progression was
there
so some are saying that that would be an
indication that Putin and pregosian are
you know at least
somehow working together
does that sound right to you
do you think there was a friendly
meaning of all the military commanders
and progression was just one of them
and that story is completely true
you believe that
no I don't know what happened
but let me tell you what I think
happened
do you remember the famous video of
Saddam Hussein
uh in in a big meeting of all the uh the
political people in Iraq before Saddam
took over
and he had his guards come in and one at
a time
removed leaders from the room and had
them executed immediately
while the others were waiting in the
room to see if they would be the next
ones to be taken out
and after he completed that
not many people went against Saddam
because they realized he was just so
badass he was going to murder you while
you sat there like while you're sitting
there he's going to take the guy next to
you and murder him right outside the
door while you sit there
waiting to know if you're next
I think that probably is a in a very
sort of indirect General way I think
that's what Putin did
I do not think Putin had an ordinary
meeting with his commanders to talk
about the fate of the Ukraine war and
make some strategy
Putin's biggest problem is he doesn't
know who's who's on the other side
I would not be surprised if pagosian was
there
and the 30 commanders were there and
while they were there
Putin had his generals come in and
remove two or three of those commanders
while the others watched it
knowing they will never see those
commanders again
right that they're going to be executed
immediately
for presumably for being part of
progocian's thing
now that would also be in my opinion the
last time any of those commanders would
see progosian because I think it would
be the ultimate dictator ball or move to
have the guy who planned and tried to
actually get a coup sitting right next
to you
while you while you take out a couple
more Commanders
and you know surrounded by people with
guns who are on your side
I think it was probably the scariest
meeting
that anybody's ever been since Saddam
I think those commanders were were being
tested for their loyalty and probably
some of them were taken out and shot
like right then that's my guess because
I also asked myself what would I do in
that situation
do you ever put yourself in the
murderous dictator frame of mind just
say well what would I do if I were a
murderous dictator how would I play this
and that's how I would play it
because Putin really has a problem of
not knowing who the the Traders are it's
a big big big big big big problem
so he would have to do something pretty
dramatic
to get past it if he can and the most
dramatic thing you could do is bring all
those commanders put them in one room
and take two of them out and shoot them
while the rest of them are sitting there
now I'm not saying he you know
necessarily physically shot anybody I'm
saying that he got him there to scare
him
and to weed out the the Traders and to
find out who was loyal and who wasn't
and I think you'd probably probably
moved him forward a little bit
but I don't believe you're going to see
uh progosian again I think that was his
one purpose
who needed him for that and now he
doesn't need him he's probably alive but
you're not going to see him again he
would be under Putin's control
all right Biden is getting some pushed
back for saying that he grudgingly
approved these cluster Munitions which
are banned and I think a hundred
countries banned them as a war crime
they're so terrible but he grudgingly
says he approved him and the reason is
that we were running out of artillery
shells
what
and
and so he says it's temporary until we
you know build up more artillery shells
but then the critic said my God you just
told our Nemesis that were out of
artillery shells or were low on them
but are you worried about that
that's not real
that's just politics
because if let me say it a different way
if Trump had said this would I be
bothered
no do you know why
who's going to attack America
in a way in which we need artillery to
defend ourselves
have you ever think of that what what is
the scenario in which America needs
artillery
Taiwan might need artillery
but it's not going to decide Taiwan that
the fate of Taiwan is not going to be
decided by artillery
do you think do you think Taiwan can win
by having an island the shooting
artillery back at the mainland
for what
what for what right now we we certainly
have enough artillery to take out the
cartels if we were down enough to use
artillery for that it would make more
sense to use drones and airplanes
did anybody who was analyzing the story
about uh Biden saying we're running out
of artillery shells or at least running
lower than we wanted to run we're not
out of course
um
does anybody think that mattered
was there any military analysis that
said but you know to be honest we have
no use for artillery whatsoever
I can't think of any use for it can you
artillery is for a land War why is
Mexico going to invade
Canada
and the artillery doesn't shoot across
the Atlantic
like who are you going to shoot
so unless we were to
um unless we needed to give them to our
allies they weren't like protecting the
Homeland with artillery
am I wrong about that
I keep saying these military things like
I have any military expertise whatsoever
but I'm not wrong am I yeah no South
Korea could make all the artillery they
want they don't need ours
all right
so there's that
um
and look how easily
so easily Biden moved from these
Munitions or a war crime to well I guess
if you need them so the only thing just
just think about how horrible this is
so we have a president you know our
leaders should be our in some ways
should be a model for us of how to
behave I mean not his personal life but
his public life should be a model for
how to behave and here he said the right
thing at one point
these Munitions these cluster bombs are
too horrible they're a war crime we
shouldn't use them and then the first
time he thought there was some advantage
in using them he used them
all it took was they had to be useful
so all of his moralizing about you know
how bad they are none of it meant
anything
it meant nothing because the moment we
needed them and not even for Homeland
Security
it's not even our own Homeland the
moment he needed them for a strategic
geopolitical purpose
boom there they are
so there's your
there's your uh
there's your morality right there
and it does make me wonder if Trump
would have done that
I think he might have
but I don't know for sure because I feel
like uh
there's there's something deeply wrong
with making a stand as a president that
this is beyond the pale these weapons
should not be used and we're even
telling the other side what weapons they
can and cannot use you know this is
Redline if you use these chemical
weapons or if you use nuclear it's a red
line
and then we we cross our own Red Line
like it didn't even matter
now I don't know if it's a good decision
or a bad decision militarily
but
it's it's a big problem when your
president can say two opposites and act
act like that's okay oh it's immoral
well if you need them
it's fine
all right
so an article today I don't know how
true it is but it's a claim that the you
know how the uh the Press likes to refer
to think tax
so these so-called think tanks are a
bunch of smart people who write up smart
opinions
because they're smart
and so the news quoting think tax makes
perfect sense right the thing tanks are
the ones who got all the thinkers so you
want to know what they think and what
they're saying and especially they like
to talk about wars
so the think tanks really weigh in on
these geopolitical Global things it's
like the war in Ukraine for example and
we find out that uh
from uh what did I not name didn't write
down the person who did this which was
good work but anyway
um
uh media Outlets have cited think tanks
with financial backing from the defense
industry
85 percent of the time
so 85 percent of the time that your news
referred to a think tank
the think tank was funded by the
military industrial complex
did you did your news ever tell you that
when your news says such and such a
think tank said this do they say at the
same time but remember they're funded by
the people who make weapons so if
they're in favor of wars
just remember
they make money from weapons
indirectly because they're funded by the
weapons industry now don't you think
that's a little bit important
just a little bit important to know that
you're quoting somebody who's literally
making money from the war indirectly but
literally
that's pretty important
85 percent of them so I would I would
give you this advice
if you hear that a think tank has been
mentioned just say to yourself oh
they're selling weapons
Think Tank equals selling weapons that's
your reframe
you'll be in good shape if you just tell
yourself think tank is a weapon sales
basically a sales force for the weapons
industry
it's not a tank
it's not about thinking and it's not
even about legitimate opinions
it's something is simply a sales force
for the weapons people
oh the think tank thinks we should
invade Ukraine how convenient for weapon
sales yeah in marketing actually
marketing would be better is marketing
for weapons
manufacturers
and
now you could say but Scott 15 of them
are not funded by the weapons people to
which I say how do you know it's 15
percent
are you an expert just ignore everything
from think tanks think tanks are a way
to launder opinions
let's say you launder an opinion put it
through the think tank oh it's not it's
not we weapons makers who say this is a
good idea it's the think tank
it's the think tank we just make weapons
oh oh we're just over here making
weapons and funding the guy who's at the
think tank
telling us you really need a lot of
those weapons you better buy some
weapons
running out of shelves
and that ladies and gentlemen is a
conclusion of my prepared remarks for
what some will call the best live stream
that's ever been presented in the
history of live streams but some will
not some will not
sub will
some will not
but I'm going to say goodbye to YouTube
thanks for joining and I will talk to
you tomorrow and I'm going to spend some
