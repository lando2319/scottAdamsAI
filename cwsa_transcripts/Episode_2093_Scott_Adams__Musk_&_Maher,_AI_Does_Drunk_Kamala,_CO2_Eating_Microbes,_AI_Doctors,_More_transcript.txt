do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time and if
you'd like your experience to be the
kind that you'll talk about to your
grandkids grandkids
I mean you'll probably live forever so
that's going to work out for you all you
need is a cup or a mug or a glass a
tanker chalices dying a canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any kind fill in with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dopamine here the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah
so good
well if you were if you were a
subscriber to the locals Channel
scottadams.locals.com you would be
seeing the new Dilbert comics called
Dilbert Reborn
and I can't I can't show you the edgiest
ones
so you just have to trust me that
they're edgier than the one I'm going to
show you right now
but here's what I can show you
and by the way this would never be
allowed in newspapers right it's going
to be fine on YouTube like YouTube is
going to be fine with it but newspapers
would have had a problem so it's the
boss he's at a meeting and he's got a
Dilbert on one side and engineer Dave
on the other and uh here's what it looks
like
and uh I'll read it to you so you don't
have to read it just see the setting and
the boss says leadership has decided to
lower our hiring standards to increase
diversity as quickly as possible then
Dave who's the black engineer in the
group says won't that make people think
I was not qualified when you hired me
and the boss says yes but it's also bad
for the rest of us then Dave says okay
as long as it's equitable
so that's something I couldn't have done
in a car in a com in a newspaper
but uh having a lot of fun with it uh
behind a subscription site
and of course the edge of your comic is
robots read news my other comic
which is always edgier
all right I would like to
nominate two words
for disgrace
can we disgrace words so if anybody uses
either of these words you should just
laugh at them like ha ha
you've used the disgraced words
that means you're not even a serious
person are you ready here are the two
disgraced words in political commentary
rant
and obsessed
if you hear somebody say that somebody
else ranted
the person who used the word you should
just mock them
I'm sure they ranted didn't they did
they rant or did they simply talk which
did they do did they rant was it ranting
or was it just sort of talking
they're not obsessed
hey here's a here's a story about uh
Disney and DeSantis why are you so
obsessed
with Disney versus DeSantis why are you
obsessed with it
no no no
you are
you you're using one of those words
obsessed or rant as soon as you hear
those words
right away those are not serious people
all right how many of you have seen the
uh AI I assume it's AI generated fake
Kamala uh drunken Kamala video If you
haven't I'm going to call it up and show
it to you right now because it might be
one of the funniest things you'll see in
a long time
all right
bear with me well I use my low Tech to
find it
um
well speaking of low Tech
I've got one of those phones that uh
doesn't seem to want to produce anything
oh my God
all my technology is broken today
so I'd like to give you uh here's my
demonstration of
watching Hulu last night so I went to
watch Hulu
looked a lot like nothing
um but then this morning I went to watch
uh Bill Maher talking to Elon Musk
so I opened up my HBO app and and here
it is here's what my HBO app looks like
so this is Hulu HBO and Twitter on my
phone they all look the same now just a
nothing
why I don't know I have no idea
why but the last several days no website
works on my devices
so I'm going to reboot my phone and
that Jesus I tell you how many times a
day
is there some basic technology that just
simply doesn't work for you is it just
me
it's not just me right
I mean ordinary stuff like your car
won't start your your phone just doesn't
work you try to get out an app they use
all the time it just doesn't work
is that your experience because all day
long I'm just solving technical problems
all day long
so yeah the last time I don't even
remember the last time I successfully
opened a streaming app and watched
something
do you know how hard I worked trying to
watch The Bill Maher musk interview I
never got to see it I couldn't find any
technology that would just show us
streaming video
now obviously I know how to use
technology I'm literally streaming on
two devices right now I don't think it's
me I think there's some weird thing
happening
and and yesterday there was like almost
every website I went to just seemed
broken
did that happen to you yesterday what
was yesterday a day when all kinds of
websites were broken or was that just me
I don't know all right I guess it was
just me
so uh there's a new obesity drug
oh great
so now big Pharma has found a way to
battle big food
so big food is killing you with food
that makes you fat the big farmer big
Pharma found a drug that will save you
from the big food
now
I'm I'm just guessing
that that won't be the healthiest thing
for you
I can't believe it's I guess it's a
diabetes drug it's the second time
there's been a second time there's been
a different kind of diabetes drug that
had a secondary use that would help you
lose weight and apparently it works yeah
the the initial reports are it totally
works
is that the worst thing you've ever
heard
now humans can eat as much crap as they
want
and they won't get fat as long as they
have another drug in their body
now I would think that the nutritional
risk from eating foods that would
normally make you fat but somehow you
found a way not to make you fat
it's not as empic is the older one
there's actually a newer better one
so the one you're thinking of that was a
diabetes drug
that is secondary use for losing weight
this is the third one of those there's
two of them that use the same drug and
then this is a new one that was just
announced today so it's not it's not the
Eurozone
all right what's it called some other
name doesn't matter
I I hate everything about this
like on on one hand it feels like it
should be this great breakthrough that's
going to help the obese
but it feels like it's going to make it
worse
does anybody get that feeling
that if you could take a drug
that would allow you to eat like a
glutton all day long and not not gain
weight or does it not work that way oh I
think maybe it makes you not hungry
is that what it does does it oh it's an
appetite suppressant okay so maybe
that's even I don't know is that better
or is that worse
if you suppress your appetite what kind
of food are you likely to eat
healthy food that doesn't taste great
or if you have a suppressed appetite
or you'd be drawn to sugary food
here's what you need
you need you need a drug that only makes
you not want to eat too much sugary
stuff
that's all you need you you want to
think you want a drug that keeps you
just as hungry as always but if you see
a piece of cake you just go the cake
and if you see uh something like a piece
of broccoli you go broccoli
gotta get me some broccoli
uh
so anyway that's happened
there is here's some good news from
science there's a microbe that eats CO2
now it's not the first time you've heard
of that right there's always some kind
of Little Critter that's eating CO2 but
nothing comes of it but this one seems
to be especially good like better than
anything that ever ate CO2 ever before
and they found it in some Italian
volcano which is where I go to look for
my microbes
if I if I need a good microbe to do
something that nobody's done I'll go to
an Italian volcano and I'll start
looking because that's where the good
ones are
um
but here's why this is cool
the most of the current CO2 capture
Technologies I don't know if you knew
this but they'll capture the CO2 and
then it's it's just this physical stuff
that they've got to put somewhere so
they've put it in a big hole so they put
in a big hole in the ground
yeah just bury it but
uh apparently if you take that same CO2
out of the atmosphere and stick it in
this Pond full of these microbes you can
put an infinite amount of CO2 into the
pond because the microbes will just eat
it
so that seems like a pretty good
solution
so I ask once again
the people who did the 50-year
the 50-year predictions about climate
change
did their prediction include
an Italian volcano creating a CO2 eating
microbe probably not
so certainly the technical developments
will change everything
so that's worth going
how many of you saw that there's a bride
magazine now Bride magazine of course
is specifically for brides
and they put on their cover now a trans
feminine activist and
that alone is not much of a story in in
2023
there's not much of a story is it that a
a trans person got put on a bride
magazine and it's not unusual at all
uh well however caught my caught my
attention was this specific trans
feminine activist is the hairiest human
being I've seen since Bigfoot
I mean I'm talking about a seriously
hairy human
and this seriously hairy human is on the
cover with with a bare midriff of head
on stomach is just pure hair
now I'm not making fun of hairy people
because there are lots of hairy people
nothing wrong with that
uh however their choice to put it on the
magazine uh read to me a little bit more
like uh embracing and amplifying
it didn't feel
it didn't feel exactly like they were
serious about it
does anybody have that feeling
like like it was almost tongue-in-cheek
but not exactly
honestly I can't take that seriously it
does not look serious it looks like they
were it looks like they had pressure
I'm just going to take a speculative
guess right I have no inside knowledge
this is not part of the story but I I
always think what was the meeting like
though you always wondered that what was
that meeting like where they talked
about that
because I think it was something like
there was a maybe a trans person in the
office perhaps and they couldn't say no
we're not going to put a trans woman on
the cover
right don't you think that there was a
you know there was a back and forth no
we can't do that and then other people
were saying yes we we need to show that
we're you know a good Progressive
company and young women in particular
are protrans
yeah I think young women are probably
the biggest supporters of the trans
Community I'm guessing it feels like it
would be the case
so they probably said yes we want to be
Progressive and so we want to put a
trans woman on the cover
now in my conspiratorial mind
what I imagine is that the people who
were dead set against the trans person
being on the cover
embraced it and went out and found the
one trans person who would do the least
good job of representing the company
just to say they did it
and now if that's what they did and I'm
not saying they did I'm just speculating
how it might have gone it would be
hilarious
and almost as if bride magazine was
mocking itself
that's how I took it I'm going to put in
those terms it looked like the magazine
was mocking itself
what do you think
because because I feel like they
obviously knew they'd gone way over the
line into territory that their readers
would
you know have a let's say a interesting
response to
do you think that you when you look at
that cover with the hairiest
trans person you've ever seen in your
life
you think that they said to themselves
yeah this is good
this is just what we wanted this is
exactly the brand
we want to project that for bride
magazine
Harry
biologically born males but now trans
women are exactly the market we're after
I'm not believing it
I feel as if it's become parody now and
I feel as if there's at least one person
at bride just guessing I have no
information about this who thought it
was just funny
to go too far
I wonder if anybody else will do that
we'll see
all right uh I remind you that I'm
pro-trans
protrans
but then still makes some of the you
know interaction funny
I think we can still do that
um I saw Brian ramelli tweet today about
the study of wolves and there's this
parasite there's a specific parasite
that usually is in cats this Toxoplasma
Gandhi parasite and after 26 years worth
of data on wolves lots of wolves they
found out that if a wolf has this
parasite
the wolf is at 40 uh what is it 40
something 46 times more likely to become
a Pac leader
so there's a parasite
that changes the aggressiveness and
behavior of wolves to such an extent it
actually makes them leaders
now
uh here's my questions
now the and here's there's a reason for
the mechanism so there's an evolutionary
reason so the idea is if the parasite
that wants to be in cats gets into
something else like a like a mouse the
mouse will actually be attracted to cat
urine
so that the mouse will more likely do
dangerous cat related things and then
get eaten and then when the cat eats the
mouse then the parasite gets back in the
cat where it wanted to be
so apparently the the parasite can
infect anybody
but once it affects anybody one of the
behaviors is it makes you recklessly get
near cats
so it might be doing that to the Wolves
it might be making the Wolves say well I
won't necessarily stay in my own
territory I'll Branch out and become a
leader
in this cat related territory over here
which makes it more likely that they'll
they'll be killed by a cat or some cat
related exposure
so here's the question
do you think there's any chance
that humans have not not necessarily
this particular microbe but do you think
there are any microbes that are making
humans act the way we Act
and that it's even passed down by
um mother to father mother to child
because I think this one actually can be
passed by birth
yeah it's entirely possible and we
didn't know about this one that was a
huge impact on the wolf Community until
recently
so don't you think we might be
basically empty puppets that are being
run by some weird microbes
could be could be just part of our
operating system
because because you notice that some
people are well let me speculate
let's just speculate
do you suppose there could be one that
causes mass shootings
now I don't think that's what's causing
it I think it's social influence and
access to weapons of course but
it could be
because when somebody becomes a mass
shooter it just doesn't seem to make any
sense to us does it it's almost like
they got some microbe that took over
their body
so I'm just going to put that out there
that I will make a prediction
I predict that in your lifetime
we will discover that there's some
different microbe that affects human
behavior substantially
what do you think
will anybody want to take the other side
of that bat we're going to find a
microbe that's influencing our behavior
in a major way we just don't know yet
all right
um
here's a big question for you I saw this
on the Tweet by a user named Camille
okay
k-a-m-i-l you would pronounce that
Camille Camille I think Bill
um
he tweeted that uh looked like he was
asking AI chat GPT some questions about
transgenderism and body dysmorphia
and
he convinced the AI
and given we know that the way you ask
the question can make a big difference
to the answer he asked the question in a
way they got the AI
to say that teaching Transit teaching
transgenderism to kids
causes body dysmorphia or dysphoria body
dysphoria
now I'm not saying that's true
I'm saying that somebody asked Ai and
they got the AI to say yes that makes
total sense
and the AI even explained this thinking
if if children are told that gender is
not sex related
and that they can choose their gender
because it's not something hard-coded at
Birth
then they're more likely to do it
so if they're more likely
to wonder about their sexual identity
because they're taught that they can
that that's an ordinary thing and
the the benefit to somebody who
has let's put it this way if you had
body dysphoria already
being taught that transgenderism is a
thing I imagine that'd be really good
for you would you agree
if you had this body dysphoria wouldn't
you be a lot happier
to learn in school that it's like a
legitimate thing and you know you have
you have a couple of paths you could
take and all that but imagine if you did
not have gender dysphoria you're just a
kid and kids can be you know wildly
confused about lots of stuff it's not
gender dysphoria
so then suddenly you start teaching the
kids that they have a choice
well you know could go this way it could
go this way it doesn't matter what you
were born with you've got options
so according to Ai and this is not me so
this is not my opinion I'm telling you a
story about somebody
who got AI to say something so there are
no human opinions involved in any of
this this is ai's opinion
teaching kids transgenderism
causes
gender dysphoria
now independent of the the content of
the question of the answer
the bigger question is this what happens
when AI starts telling us things that
make sense
but disagree with what is acceptable and
appropriate and woke what are we going
to do
are we going to turn off the AI
we're going to call it a liar
are we going to say it's bigot AI is a
bigot
I think that's what's going to happen
prediction number two
AI will be labeled bigots
AI will be called a racist and a
misogynist
and probably anti-trans at some point
don't you think and and how in the world
could that be avoided
I don't see any way that can be avoided
because because humans call other humans
all these names you know big racist Etc
are they always right
how often does a human correct
when they call somebody else a racist in
the United States not often not often
but it's pretty rare it's just something
you say against political enemies mostly
now you don't think that that same
impulse will be used on AI
when AI starts telling you things you
don't like you're going to call it a
bigot and a racist and tell everybody to
stop listening to it
you're going to want to people are going
to try to cancel AI there I said it
humans will try to cancel AI for being
too bigoted
and it doesn't mean it will be bigoted
it might be it's been you know it's
trained by people so it probably is but
even if it's not
somebody's not going to like their
answer
and they're gonna say well that's
bigoted yeah I know you're just being an
AI and I know you're just doing what
you're programmed but that's so bigoted
so yeah we'll use uh that to limit AI
[Applause]
all right uh
how many of you want me to talk about
Stephen Crowder's divorce given that
he's talking about it publicly
I'm going to take a vote
I saw one yes but mostly no's
so mostly we should leave them alone
what do you say
just leave them alone to let it work out
your vote is
accepted
topic removed forever
from this live stream
the public has spoken
and by the way
I'm kind of proud of you I didn't know
why you would say than that I kind of
thought it would be closer to 50 50. but
I do like the fact that you have a very
high
it looks like 80 80 20 kind of thing at
least 90 10 maybe
well that is a really good statement
about all of you I have to say
so you're better people than I am
in many ways
All Right Moving On
The Washington Post which as you know
seems to like the Democrats better than
the Republicans have given Biden a
bottomless Pinocchio
uh apparently that's their worst rating
for lying the bottomless Pinocchio now
for context they gave Trump a lot of
bottomless pinocchios
and the the standard for the bottomless
Pinocchio which is the worst of all the
pinocchios bottomless the standard is
you have to say the same lie like a
whole bunch of times like 30 times or
something but if you say the whole lie
like a whole bunch of times that it's a
bottomless Pinocchio and uh Biden
apparently keeps going around saying
that he lowered the deficit by a record
1.7 trillion
a claim that the Washington Post Kessler
gave three pinocchios in September
so this is September when he started
saying it it was clearly not true
but it wasn't yet a bottomless Pinocchio
but he's he's now said it so many times
uh he said it 30 times since June
and there's just no truth to it at all
apparently apparently it's so untrue
that the story doesn't even bother to
say why he says it like well he's
counting this but not that it just feels
like it's just some shitty made up that
he just says it
and apparently uh
as far as I can tell Democrats believe
him
because uh I was joking the other day
that some CNN said
that Biden will try to distract from his
age as an issue by talking about the
economy
and I just laughed I go really you're
going to distract from your bad feature
your age by talking about your worst
feature how you handle the economy and I
couldn't even believe anybody would say
that unless they were joking I actually
tweeted it as a joke
like without any change I just thought
oh that's just so funny just the way it
is without anything added
I just thought it was funny that
somebody thought they should distract to
make us look at his economy
and then I find out
he's been telling people mostly his own
crowd I guess that he's been lowering
the deficit by 1.7 trillion
because if that were real wouldn't you
think he did a good job
I mean that would be kind of impressive
because the thing I'm worried about the
most is the deficit he says he lowered
it
if he really lowered the deficit by 1.7
trillion that would be the one of the
greatest accomplishments of any
president but he didn't do anything like
that he just lied about it because he's
old
not because he's a little bit because
he's a liar
all right so I guess he'll be running on
his record of honesty against Trump
again
it still blows my mind
that somebody thinks he's the honest one
Joe Biden he's like one of the most
famous Liars in all of politics now
Trump would be the other one of course
but the fact that anybody thinks that
one of them is the honest one of you
know Trump versus Biden
yeah pick the one who passes all the
fact checking
they're exactly the same
those two are exactly the same they
don't tell the truth about anything if
there's a you know better story
and this again is why I tell you I we
need the country needs a debate between
uh Vivek ramaswamy and RFK Jr
not because they have a huge chance of
becoming president at the moment things
could change
things could change quickly actually
but because they both have a history of
not being Liars now you can argue that
they've been wrong about stuff
I'm not arguing that they've been right
about everything I'm just saying that
there's no evidence that they've
intentionally just told a bottomless
Pinocchio there's no bottomless
Pinocchio is happening with those two
so let's see him talk let's see him
let's see him figure out what's true and
what isn't
all right um
so now doctors are using AI
to craft draft responses and save time
this is one of the best uses of AI that
I've seen yet
so when somebody writes to their doctor
which is common on email as soon as the
email goes as soon as the doctor goes to
respond AI gives types out the draft
response in the email
because most stuff is is common somebody
will say hey I think I have an ear
infection
what should I do well you don't
necessarily need them to come in for
you know to to check them out in person
so you might say something like well
here's a prescription for this and use
it three times a day and get back to me
in a week if it doesn't work
so that all appears in the email and
then the doctor skims it goes oh yeah
that's what I was going to say boop
it's kind of amazing kind of amazing
so
but uh apparently AI was tested
by real doctors to see if it could give
as answers that are as good as doctors
and what the doctors judge was that the
AI was actually better
than human doctors already
but this makes me ask the following
question
how do humans judge an intelligence
that's smarter than they are
at the moment
they probably can
because if it makes like an obvious
mistake you know it tells you to take a
drug too much or something that'd be
obvious
but what happens in just a little bit of
time maybe a year when the AI doctor is
unambiguously better than human doctors
but the human doctors will be the ones
who decide how good it is right because
they will test they'll test the AI
against their own knowledge and opinions
what happens if they don't match
well in today's world I mean literally
just today if they don't match the
doctor still wins
and the doctors give him no that's not
it I I overrule you and everybody thinks
that's probably a good idea
but what happens when there's just no
question just no question that AI has
higher accuracy than human doctors it's
less than a year away
that's going to happen
well then the doctor tries to overrule
it
should they
do you want your doctor to overrule the
AI if you know the AI is better than the
doctor
so this is where I'm predicting that AI
will be capped
in some areas we will not want AI to be
smarter than us
after it is murdered us
so we're going to treat it like we treat
humans
if you let's say you go into a debate uh
uh let's use real people
let's say a dumb person goes into a
debate
with Ben Shapiro a famous smart person
in the real world Ben Shapiro would
annihilate the less intelligent
competitor in any kind of a debate I
mean it would just be a you know
Slaughter
but what is this person who got
slaughtered a hypothetical person who
gets slaughtered in their debate against
Ben Shapiro say about it
do they say
to me apart in front of a big crowd of
people who all agree he ripped me apart
does anybody ever say that
nope no they think they won
if Ben Shapiro just shredded you in
front of a huge crowd of people who all
agreed that he shredded you you would
still walk away saying you know I think
it was a tie
or or I think I actually won because you
know the crowd was just on his side or
something like that so we're going to do
the same thing with AI when AI just
destroys us with his better arguments we
humans are going to say no you got that
one wrong
I I think my opinion actually is better
than that
if I'm if I'm being honest I I see all
your smart a I answer but no I think I
think my answer is a little bit more on
the Mark if you know what I mean
so AI will certainly be gated by our own
intelligence
um
cities are starting to convert their uh
empty or office spaces into residential
space
now they're doing it in Boston Seattle
and some other places but
I don't understand how it's going to
work in a city that's a crime infested
toilet
who's going to want to move into a city
just because they can
it feels like the very worst
thing for some cities so
my prediction is the cities that are you
know let's say red states are red red
local government
the Republicans I think probably are
good on crime
so if you were moving into a an office
building that had been converted in a
in a red City
it might be a great great thing imagine
living in a high-rise in the middle of
the city the city you want to live in
and you've got a like a full gym
like not just a little crappy one like
they have with a you know some apartment
buildings they'll give you like a little
crappy gem but like like a serious full
gym
and then you've got you know all these
windows looking out at the at the
scenery you've got security because it's
a you know probably Security in the
lobby
um
I feel like it would be a really good
lifestyle you can imagine one one floor
being food and Starbucks and places
where people can take their laptop and
stuff
and meet other people I think it'd be
kind of Awesome
but it's got to be the right City
so apparently that will be the
um the thing that these commercial
properties you're going to do to try to
save themselves now the the good news is
sport local coffee shops well it would
be a local coffee shop it would be right
into your building it could literally be
Starbucks or you're saying you don't
want it all right I get it
um I love Starbucks too much too
to uh to be on your side of that all
right
um did you you've probably heard the
story from before
there's a Palestinian Mickey Mouse
so they've got some kind of character
that does a TV show for kids that's just
a knockoff of Mickey Mouse but it's the
Palestinian version and
this was the story from today
the Hamas TV on Friday
um they did the last episode of the show
called far four
and their Mickey Mouse character
uh who is now called Mickey Mouse it's
something else
either he preaches Islamic domination
and armed struggle to youngsters
in the final skit uh the oh far four is
the name of the mouse uh farfer was
beaten to death by an actor posing as an
Israeli official trying to buy four
Four's land
laughs
the Palestinian children's programming
needs some work
Palestinian children are watching a
giant mouse being beaten to death by an
Israeli official tried to buy his land
and at one point the giant mouse called
4-4 calls the Israeli a terrorists
and then and then he was martyred
defending his land
oh man it must be tough to be a kid
over there
oh they grow up so fast
all right
I'm only laughing because it's so
horrible right like it
so
so somebody says it's not funny no it is
funny it's funny because it's so beyond
the realm of appropriate behavior or
acceptable behavior it's just crazy
all the news is just people going too
far that's too far
the bride magazine with the hairy bride
that's too far
you know if they just stuck with a a
trans woman
who did a great job of looking like a
biologically born woman
well that wouldn't be too far in 2023
that'd be sort of ordinary actually
but but bride magazine had to go too far
they had to they they had to put a yeti
on the cover
and this is too far too
back in 2014 San Francisco schools
dropped eighth grade Algebra because uh
they wanted to reduce inequities because
apparently some people weren't doing
well in algebra so their solution was to
just stop it just stop doing that
and it turns out that the the parents
are organizing to get it back
do you know why they're organizing to
get um
to get
algebra back into eighth grade
because they thought the school went too
far too far now it's just too far taking
taking it away frankly so we're trying
to get it back they don't want to be the
laughing stock for being you know one of
the places that doesn't teach a basic
course to kids
now personally I don't know how much
algebra helps you
unless you're going on to stem and some
other high-end stuff
so I don't know I'm somewhere in the
middle of this I think the the highest
achieving students should have access to
it
but I don't think I just don't think
algebra helps the average person do you
now I I can honestly say I have used
algebra as an adult how many of you
could say that
I I've used algebra in my day job
I think I've used it in my cartooning
work
yeah yeah usually just simple stuff you
know solving for a variable right yeah
just solve me for a variable usually
so
I would say I do use it but if I'd never
learned it it wouldn't have made that
much of a difference I mean it didn't
really change the course of my life or
anything it was just sort of a handy
little tool to have I'm sure AI could
have done it for me
do you think you would need algebra in a
world of AI
nope no you'll never you'll never use
basic algebra in a world of AI because
you'll just pick up your phone
and you'll say
um solve for x with 2X equals you know
three Y and Y equals this
you'll you'll just tell the machine to
do it of course you'd have to be smart
enough to know it's a
it's a formula
yeah maybe we do need a little algebra a
little bit of algebra for the people who
are going on to some types of careers
would be good
all right
um
Kansas passed the law
that you
foreign
this feels too far too
uh Kansas passed a law that trans people
can't use the
um I guess if you're going to use the
woman's restroom
in Kansas and after I don't know in a
few months or something when the law
goes into effect you have to have
ovaries
say I think the ovaries is where they
decided to draw the line if you were not
born with ovaries
then you'd have to use the male bathroom
I guess now of course it's what you're
born with so hysterectomies are not
irrelevant questions while you were born
with
um
what do you think of that
and I'm wondering what happens if you
were uh
let's say a trans woman and you went
into a woman's restroom
and somebody complained
would you have to prove you do or do not
have ovaries
or would people just admit it so you
wouldn't have to prove it
how does anybody know if you have
ovaries
can they tell just by looking at you I
guess the guy the the the the person
they put on bride magazine you could
tell
but I don't know if you could always
tell
I don't know we'll see how this law
works I would like to add to the trans
bathroom issue that their natural
Alliance would be with
their natural Alliance would be with
people who have pyreesis
shy bladder
as I've mentioned way too many times
there are a number of people and I'm one
of them who can't use public restrooms
because our bodies just don't just won't
do it you can force yourself to like be
there and
you know trying to do it but your body
just won't do it if there are people
around it's it's a sort of a
psychological condition mostly
but
those people
and I'm one of them so I can say those
people in this case
um really really need an option where
there's just a single single bathroom
option
so if you added all the trans people of
which there are more every day and then
you add that to the people who are sort
of coming out of the water closet as
they like to say the people who had shy
bladder
is that not enough
and then maybe there's some other some
other things you throw in there is that
maybe and maybe handicapped as well so
maybe there are uh at least three
categories of people who
legitimately
um for reasons that everybody would
agree maybe they need a little extra
privacy
so I don't I think I would disagree with
making it some kind of a requirement
I wouldn't make it a requirement
but
it would be nice to have a third option
for a variety of people for a variety of
reasons no children yeah
that's that's another good one because
isn't it creepy
um when I when I belong to a gym which I
don't know
but what I belong to a gym and I would
see fathers bring their
five-year-old daughters into the men's
locker room and the men are standing
there bought naked and there's this
little five-year-old girl who can walk
and talk and she's just hanging around
in the middle of it like to me that was
just too far like I wasn't comfortable
with it but wouldn't it be nice
yeah if I if a father and a young
daughter could have their privacy as
well
so
might be other reasons for that
all right is there any big story I
missed
any big story I missed
the any other famous people die since I
started
um
oh Elon yeah
so Elon Musk went on Bill Maher and I
thought it was going to make a bunch of
news
but I don't think it did
because they just agreed with each other
that the woke mind virus is bad and
getting canceled is bad and free speech
is good
so and and it sounded like Bill Maher
was very Pro musk in terms of you know
what he does as an entrepreneur and as a
citizen of the country it's all very
impressive
um
Bill still believes the Russian
collusion hoax I don't think he does
uh
margin degree just stayed quiet
so I couldn't as I said I couldn't
stream it because my technology just
decided I can't use my apps for reasons
I don't understand
now let's see if I've rebooted my phone
well apparently I didn't
I was going to play that Kamala Harris
I've all talked about so there's a AI of
Kamal Harris
in which they started with a speech
where she did the crazy talk about time
and the passage of time must be
contextualized in the current time
versus the passage of time you know that
thing
so they turned it into a longer
rambling thing and they made her sound
drunk well
now
it was so good
that yeah the only reason I know it's
fake is that I saw the original
I would imagine that was so good that
people would look at that and
not be able to tell
all right let me see if Twitter is
giving
is Twitter doesn't work on my phone I'm
just going to throw it in the
ocean all right it's working
apparently had to reboot my phone just
to use the app
so let me play it for you here I swear
this will be worth waiting for you're
gonna love it
all right
today's today
and yesterday was today yesterday
tomorrow will be today tomorrow so even
her face is a little drunk today
[Laughter]
today's today
and yesterday was today yesterday
tomorrow will be today tomorrow
so live today
this is the future today will be as the
past
today
as it is tomorrow
today's today
and yesterday was today yesterday
tomorrow will be today
oh God
all right
so there's a new embarrassing uh video
of her loving Venn diagrams I was
watching on Hannity a clip where they
showed all the times that she screamed
her love of Venn diagrams and giggled
uncontrollably
and it's really cringy to to watch it
all together because it always starts
with and I'm going to talk about Venn
diagrams have I told you how much I love
I love Venn diagrams I know you're
laughing but I love them I love that Van
Dyke of you know the three circles you
know you could put anything in a Venn
diagram anything
a yellow school bus with Wi-Fi you can
put it in a Venn diagram
and it just looks crazy
but it also looks inebriated
it looks inebrained
and whoever did this AI effort talking
about time
obviously he thought it looked
inebriated enough that the parody would
be her fully inebriated
now
the mainstream the mainstream media is
completely avoiding
the obvious are they not
is it not obvious that she's either
inebriated or she acts like somebody who
is
I mean I I don't know if she's a knee
brain but isn't it obvious that she's
acting like she is
how do you ignore that
I mean seriously how do you ignore that
of all things because I think even I
think even the media on the right is
ignoring it
do they think it's that she's not
inebriated
do you think the big opinion people on
the right don't see it
am I the only one that thinks she acts
like it and again I don't know
it could be natural
but if you saw anybody else acting like
that you would assume they were drunk
wouldn't you
yeah
maybe she's got a microbe that makes her
love Venn diagrams
excellent callback I wish I thought of
that excellent callback
uh you think I planted that idea
I don't know
maybe but I think other people would see
it right well let me ask you
if if you had not heard it from me if
you had never heard of me never heard
anything I ever said about anything ever
would any of you have on your own said
she looks drunk
anybody
it's not just because I influenced you
right yeah I'm seeing lots of people say
yes she looks she looks at
or so inebriated in some way right
how do we ignore that
I mean really all right I'm going to
make a prediction
within the next
month
there will be notable pundits on the
right who will expressly say that she's
acting inebriated
what do you say now I think it would be
way too far if they said she's drunk
because we don't know that
we only know she acts like one
and that part we can confirm because
that's our opinion right well I've seen
drugs and I've seen her
and they sort of look the same to me
yeah I think in one month you'll see
people calling her inebriated
you might even see a Democrat do it if
they really really need to get rid of
her
all right now I tweeted uh
that to me it's obvious and I wondered
if Democrats now
that the reason that Biden is running
for a re-election at this age
it's a variety of reasons you know it's
not just one reason
but I think the biggest one is to
protect Hunter and the rest of the
family maybe his brother too
don't you
I don't think there's any way in the
world that a man his age and as
obviously
let's say
affected by age
I don't think there's any way he would
he would run just for political reasons
or just for personal reasons I mean you
know ambition
I don't think it's ambition
I don't think it's to prove a point
I don't think it's anything except it's
the best way to protect his family as
long as possible because he might think
that as soon as he's out of office
Hunter goes to jail
which is possible
it's very possible
now some people said but Scott that's
stupid because uh Joe Biden could just
pardon Hunter and anybody else he wanted
to Pardon and then there's no risk
do you believe that
no because first of all he can only
pardon Federal offenses
right so only Federal offenses and I
assume there's going to be some State
gun charge or something in there sooner
or later
uh
and what would that look like
politically if Biden
um
the Democrats and the left-leaning press
that ever had happened in their life
because they would have to explain why
you gave a
uh why you'd why you'd want to clear
somebody who had not been convicted or
something
right it would look it would make Hunter
look completely guilty at the same time
it would look make Joe Biden look
completely guilty secondly do you think
there's any chance that he would pardon
Hunter sort of preemptively
uh without partying himself
or having his vice president pardon him
you know once once the vice president is
uh takes over the office
I don't think so
because if he asked for a pardon himself
again the public is going to say that's
guilty
so somehow he has to get out of office
with his family not in jail
without the stigma of a pardon now the
pardon is still an option
but can you imagine how much he doesn't
want to do that because it's basically a
confession of guilt the the public would
see it as a confession of guilt am I
wrong
the public would see it as guilt right
it is pretty rare to give somebody a
pardon for something then they didn't do
and you know for sure they didn't do it
because Biden knows for sure what
happened he knows for sure what's true
so do you give a pardon
yeah no everybody would everybody would
just assume that he figured he would be
in trouble without the pardon
uh
okay
all right
we already know on the guilt
um I saw somebody who follows the news
on the left
who believes that
[Music]
um
the Democrats have seen no evidence that
Biden did anything wrong with any of the
dealings with Hunter
do you think that's true
I think it is true
no I I think that the average Democrat
is now seeing anything close to news on
that topic
well thank you Emil
all right
uh
yeah even if even if let's say let's
speculate if Hunter Biden didn't pay his
taxes on any of his gains from his
overseas activities
the he would be guilty for federal taxes
but also state taxes so even if he got
pardoned for all the federal stuff he'd
still have to deal with state state
taxation
can someone tell you what Hunter's been
charged with the answer is nothing and
that's the point
the point is he hasn't been charged
the evidence that he should be charged
is
somewhat massive
but I'm also very interested in if
there's a taxation issue if there's a
taxation issue and it's gone this far
I would say that it's pretty clear that
there's something he didn't declare
do you think that's fair to say
if the IRS has an extended and extended
investigation
it's because there's something that's
not on his taxes as it should be right
or there's some deduction that shouldn't
be there but I think more likely it's
something that didn't show up for
example isn't there a story about him
receiving a diamond
that he says he lost
is that true
because if it's true
he has to pay taxes on receiving the
diamond
and it and he gets no benefit for losing
it
if you make some money and then it
catches on fire in your house and it
burns up your money's just gone
yeah it's just gone
yeah so you can imagine there's a whole
bunch of sketchy situations where he
said in public
or was did he say it I believe he said
that he did receive a diamond and lost
it
am I remembering that wrong can you
confirm that
you can confirm that right
the diamond could have been insured but
almost certainly wasn't do you know why
because things like diamonds have to be
specifically mentioned in insurance
here's what you can't do with your
insurance company hey insurance company
I lost a 75 000 diamond
how do we know you ever have it
oh
and there's your insurance yeah uh and I
can speak from in from experience so if
you buy an expensive wedding ring and
you don't take a picture of it and send
the documentation to your insurance
carrier you know if it's a real
expensive one uh they won't cover it
they're just going to say you didn't
tell us you had it
so the expensive stuff that's easy to
steal and easy to lose you have to tell
them or it's not covered
yeah so do you believe that uh as soon
as Hunter
this you know drug down guy as soon as
he received this diamond do you think
the first thing he did was tell his
insurance company hey I got an extra
diamond
I don't think so
no
no so I don't think it was covered by
insurance I'm not exactly sure it was
lost you know what I mean
like I doubt it was lost
maybe he just doesn't want to tell you
who he gave it to he maybe he gave it to
a hooker or something
so
yeah maybe it could be lost I suppose he
lost two laptops so he could lose a
diamond he's a he would he was drugged
down enough to lose a diamond
it was the only rock he couldn't smoke
a boom
he lost it on Jeweler's row
Mecca bouse
all right I think we've covered all the
big stories today better than
anything you're ever going to see in the
rest of your life
he didn't actually lose it somebody says
all right
uh YouTube thanks for joining
and I will see you tomorrow same place
same time
best live stream ever
