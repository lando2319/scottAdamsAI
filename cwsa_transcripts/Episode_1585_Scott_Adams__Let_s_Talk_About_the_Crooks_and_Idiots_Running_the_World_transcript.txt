good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
yup coffee with scott adams
the highlight of your life and every
other life on this planet
it's that good
and today is going to be a burner
a burner i tell you it's going to light
your hair on fire and
activate all of your senses
in a good way
but before we do that let's have a thing
i like to call the simultaneous sip and
all you need is a copper bug or glass a
tanker jealous is dying in a candy joke
or flask a vessel of any kind filling
with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better including
your vitamin d
i don't know that there's any science
behind that but i feel like it's true
and that's good enough
go
ah
yeah
that's the stuff
that's the good stuff right there
well did you see that uh devin nunes
will be the ceo of uh i guess trump's
platform
that he's creating truth said truth
something
and
that'll be fun so that's a pretty
serious
ceo but i worry that it will become just
a conservative platform and then we'll
never get to talk to each other again
you know there's a lot of pressure i get
to you know leave the traditional
platforms
and go to the alternative platforms
now except for locals which is a special
case
i'm not sure i want to go where they're
only conservatives
or only
people on the left i feel that feels
like
working in the wrong direction really
now i suppose if you get cancelled it's
the only choice you have but i'd rather
have some chance
of talking to people who disagree with
me
instead of just talking to people who
agree with me
well the golden age is here and i will
give you a few different examples of it
uh number one the omicron virus
it's too early to say this for sure
i'm just feeling good
so the omicron has now hit my state
california
we've got a few identified cases in the
south and by the way a number of people
asked
how do we know what variant it is
because as people who do testing for a
living point out
we don't test for that
you know if you go in to get a covet
test nobody's checking your variant
so i assume it has to be some kind of a
dna analysis and then i ask myself
how do they know who to check
how do they do that is it some kind of
representative sample
they must do some kind of representative
sample but then how do they know they're
exactly
two people who have the variant
if you did a representative sample you
wouldn't necessarily know
would you i guess i guess you don't mix
the samples
so yeah i guess you would know
it's a narrative sample somebody says
well i want that sweet sweet omicron to
come my way because apparently there are
no reports of deaths or even
hospitalizations
do you hear what i just said
apparently there are no cases of
hospitalization or deaths with the
omicron
now that doesn't mean it's not happening
because it's a little too early to get
all the way excited about it
but i'm a little bit excited
it's premature it could turn out to be
just a big nothing and
maybe it doesn't give you any immunity
against the other variants who knows
anything's possible but at the moment i
choose optimism
and i think this sweet sweet omicron if
i could get it i would infect myself
tomorrow
if i had a choice between a third
booster
or you know the booster shot
or the omicron
which one's a better bet
would you rather have a booster or the
omicron
well we don't know right the last thing
you want to do is listen to health
advice from a cartoonist then go get
yourself infected and die
don't do that
but i'm telling you
we might be on the verge of something
really good here with this omicron
let me tell you about a
investment method that i sometimes use
with mixed results
don't be like me don't follow my medical
advice and definitely don't follow my
financial advice okay
got that
these are just things to talk about not
things to recommend
but one of my gambling methods that i've
been trying out is
betting against the news
meaning that if the news says something
is terrible and we're all going to die
i bet against that if i can find a way
to to buy a stock that would be the bet
against the news
so when the omicron variant came out
i bet against it
by buying stock in wind the
the casino hotel
so the wind is a you know high quality
hotel casino property that got beaten up
by the
by the pandemic and when the omicron
news came it it dipped again and i said
to myself you know
the news is usually wrong
so that was my whole bet
my whole bet is the news is usually
wrong
and it was worried about the omicron so
i said they're usually wrong
so i'll just bet against it so i bought
windstock
as of yesterday it was up
let's see if it's a bad idea as of today
uh let's see what's happening today
might be too early
where is it
where the hell is it uh up another 3.8
today so that would be up about
seven or nine since i bought it just you
know the other day
so
don't do what i do because i also bought
um
i also bought years ago stock and what
was the company that did the golf
disaster
was that
which which oil
company or bp yeah so bp did that so
when bp was totally beaten down i bought
that stock
the same same purpose i was betting
against the news because the news was
saying it's the worst disaster blah blah
it will take years to get better now
here i was right
but i was a little bit wrong
meaning that i bet against the news
that it would be an ecological
and ecological disaster of epic
proportions
i bet that it would be less of a
disaster
than the news was reporting was i right
apparently apparently they they figured
out how to minimize it stuff didn't die
as much as they thought so it turned out
to be way less of a problem
than the news predicted
so i correctly
i correctly predicted that the news
would be wrong
but the stock was a dog
so in terms of a a trading method it
didn't work
so it may work with the win
purchase it didn't work with bp
so don't take my advice
but if you tried to do this you need a
portfolio
meaning don't do it with one stock
that's just gambling
but if you had a philosophy you wanted
to check
with smallish enough money that you
could buy you know
say three to five stocks that fell into
that category where you're betting
against the news
i bet you do all right over time i bet
you do all right
yeah
but again don't follow that because
that's an unproven technique
now elon musk has said that uh the
neurolink chips that they actually uh
they dig a little bit out of your skull
i believe
put the chip into your skull and i don't
know batch it up somehow
and they're gonna use it first for
quadriplegics
so the
quadriplegics in theory
would be able to think
what they wanted
and then devices that could read the
neural link connection apparently would
respond
so in other words if you had no arms and
no legs you could still turn on your
television and change the channels
that sort of thing
to which i said
we have reached the age of magic
this is the age of magic
where if somebody came to our planet and
observed us let's say 10 years
they would see us just walking into a
room and the lights come on
they'd see that the tv would come on to
the channel we wanted just because we
looked at it
everything around us will respond to our
thoughts
in 10 years
our thoughts
just try to process that
that the technology already exists to
control your environment
with your thoughts
now we don't know if it's safe yet
that's part of you know the the whole
fda approval process and everything else
so could you have some surprises
but it looks like
we're going to control our environment
with our thoughts
now
imagine the military application
could you imagine because i feel like
this could happen
that a military person who has the the
chip
could simply look at a let's say
a tank
and call in a strike
just look at it just look at the tank
and say
die
and a missile comes in from
from somewhere and just keys on where
he's looking
literally figures out
you know triangulates from the two eyes
and figures out exactly where that is
and
and then destroys it
i think that's going to happen
so all kinds of fun things that
elon musk has planned for society we
shall see
so you heard that don lemon was
apparently texting with uh jesse smullet
at about the time of the attacks a
number of times they
they were talking to each other
but it makes you uh makes you wonder
what they were talking about
because
have you noticed that uh
first of all they're basically the same
person but one has a beard
has anybody noticed that yet
they're pretty much the same person but
one has a beard
what is jesse smullet most famous for
a hoax
what is don lemon most famous for
oh
hoaxes
turns out they have a lot in common so i
wonder if they have some kind of a
support group for hoaxers who have been
caught
uh no don lemon still has his job which
is weird
if if i had to bet who was gonna go
first
don lemon or chris cuomo i would have
bet lemon
he already had you know allegations
against them that looked pretty bad but
he's hanging in there
so the two hoax twins the hoax brothers
don lemon and jesse i guess they're
they're buddies
have you ever noticed
that whenever science comes up with a
new cool drug
to fix something
the side effect is always uh but you
can't have sex
it's like we have this chemical that
will help you regrow hair man
but it's going to ruin your ability to
have sex
we can make that pain go away
but you're not going to be able to have
sex
you know that skin problem you've got
we've got a cure for that but you won't
have to be able to have sex
all right right it's like every drug
makes you unable to have sex until
the golden age
what does the golden age look like well
it looks like this apparently
people who are on viagra
uh or the or the generic of viagra is
linked to an almost 70 percent lower
risk of alzheimer's
that's pretty good seventy percent now
they don't know yet if it's a cause or
just correlate it
but there's a strong suggestion that it
might be causal
which brings us to the following
possibility in the in the near term
that we're going to have a lot of 80
year old citizens
they're 80 years old
and because they're on the viagra
they don't have the alzheimer's so their
minds are perfectly clear
and they're hard as rocks
and absolutely nobody in the world will
want to have sex with them
which they will clearly understand
because their minds will be so clear
and their boners will be so raging
that they will be in this torturous
entity
kind of a living hell
where all you want to do is
have sex
but nobody wants to have it with you
so good and bad good and the bad
well there's a rasmussen poll on kamala
harris see how popular she is
and here are the results 19 said very
favorable
that's right
19 percent have looked at kamala
harris's performance and said said to
themselves
i need more of that
i need more of that
and four percent said they don't know
which seems roughly the same number of
american citizens
who wouldn't be able to name the vice
president if he asked
so who's the vice president of the
united states
uh
dan quayle
so if you were to add together
the very favorable with the
four percent who don't know who the vice
president is
you'd get about 23
23
that's just about the 25 percent to get
every poll number wrong for every poll
question wrong
uh 50 have a very unfavorable opinion of
the vice president
very unfavorable
so the uh the favorables if you add
together the favorite categories would
be uh 39 favorable
with uh 57
that are leading unfavorable that's not
even close
not even close
all right here's my advice i've given
you this before but i feel it's
necessary
that whenever you see rogue doctors the
ones who are disagreeing with the
the mainstream advice
i give them a five percent chance of
being right regardless of the topic
right
so if the topic is who knows what
doesn't matter and it could be scientist
or or medical professionals
but the rogues who disagree with the
mainstream on average
this is a life experience thing this is
not based on some data that you could
ask me for just my observation
of all the people i've seen as the
rogues
i'd say they're right about five percent
of the time
why five i mean
i'm making up numbers i mean you can say
ten percent whatever but it's a low
number
so if the only thing you knew is that
the mainstream whatever believed x
and there were there was a rogue doctor
or even several even several rogue
doctors and they have a different
opinion
there's about a 95 chance they're wrong
now why do you think it's higher
what would make you think
that the rogues the the ones who
disagree why why would you think that
they're right more than five percent
maybe they are but why would you think
that
what would be your evidence
to suggest that the rogues
would be right and then what percentage
higher than five percent
because clocks are right twice a day
censorship of competing narrative
contrarian investing is the same as
rogue doctors no that's an analogy
analogies are not part of reason
um
facts are you a rogue
i am a rogue so here's how you can tell
the difference between
the uh the rogues and the the people who
are just right more often than not
track record
the first time i predicted that trump
would win the election in 2016 should
you have believed me
i wouldn't have
because you didn't know anything about
me right
i gave you my argument i told you why i
thought he'd win but should you have
believed me
i don't think so i mean not in the
beginning should you believe me now if i
make a prediction well not believe me
because the prediction is just
statistical the sort of thing
but would i be more credible now
that you've watched my track record of
predicting the hard to predict
i would say my track record is the best
i've ever seen i can't think of anybody
who's even close
so if you look at somebody who
consistently
is a rogue and gets it right
then that would be a special case
if there's if you don't know anything
about the doctor the same way you
wouldn't have known anything about me
the first you know first year you saw me
why would you bet
why would you bet on somebody like me
like even if i have a good argument it's
a bad bat
but sometimes the five percent comes
through
there the reason that you think the
rogues are likely to be right
or give them or even if you give them
great credibility
is because they get a lot of attention
and you remember the times that the
rogues were right
right
if somebody if somebody disagrees with
the mainstream and they turn out to be
wrong well you just never hear of them
again
but if they turn out to be right they're
celebrated you know geniuses they got
everything right
so of course your your impression of how
correct the rogue
doctors are is probably really really
exaggerated by
observation
meaning that you see the rogues being
right way more than they are normally
right
all right so i can't support my five
percent number i'm just saying it's
experiential
but if you have if you have a high
confidence in the people let's say more
than 50 percent
if your confidence in the rogue doctors
is more than 50 percent i would say
that's not
supportable based on any experience
you've had
and any experience i've had it's just
not supportable but does that mean the
rogue doctors are wrong no
no
no no no
they could be totally right
sometimes they're right about five
percent in my in my experience
so just keep that in mind uh and you
don't have to use my estimate of five
percent
use your own but that's just the way you
should think of it
because you can't really untangle what
these experts say compared to what the
other experts say we're not smart enough
to do that
so
just know that
so i was seeing some videos of the uh
so-called australian penal colonies for
coveted people where they have to go to
him and
and
stay there for is it two weeks can
somebody give me
i asked that question on twitter and
then somebody thought i was in favor of
penal colonies
but it's two weeks 14 days yeah so how
many of you have seen the video of what
they look like
on the inside the the so everybody gets
a private
sort of little private cabiny thing
i think they have their own bathroom
they should right they're trying to keep
them away from people
and
it's basically a
cheap hotel room it looks like
wouldn't you say
now
here's my question
how many people would be happier going
there for two weeks than their normal
life
what do you think
because
is there anybody who just works all the
time
a lot of us work basically from
god-awful morning till god awful night
right
aren't there a lot of you who work
from the moment you get up to the time
you flop in bed and exhausted
that's a lot of us right
a lot of us do that because you're
working then there's kids or there's
other responsibilities
how many of you would say to yourself
and and i want to be really clear i'm
not supporting
these australian penal colonies
i'm simply curious
this is just curiosity i'm not promoting
them i'm not promoting the vaccination
you know we're just talking here but how
many of you would say to yourself
i could take two weeks in that cabin and
if i had my phone and some entertainment
i i think i could take two weeks in that
cabin
now most of you say hell no of course
but is there anybody here who would say
yeah i could do that
yeah so i'm seeing people say yes
now i would assume
i would assume most of you would say no
and most of you would want to shut it
down right
and i appreciate that opinion
i do appreciate that
but
those of you who are sure that they've
created a hellscape
i doubt it
i doubt it i think it's an inconvenience
that most of you wouldn't want and you
worry that it will turn into something
bigger of course
uh but i think this story is way
overblown
now just to be clear
i don't favor it and i don't favor
mandates in general
so i'm not in favor of it
but i think the the story of how bad it
is is greatly exaggerated but uh having
said that it would be terrible for some
individuals
and other other people would just go in
there and say
two weeks without working two weeks
without my
family
i could do that
somebody said it's a it's a porn addicts
four seasons resort
that's pretty funny
um
who's messaging me all right
um
drake
the the artist drake has withdrawn his
2021 grammy nomination
he had two nominations for i think best
album rap album
and best performer
and he withdrew we don't know why he
withdrew his grammy nominations
um
but i think it's a step in the right
direction because as you know
drake is the nickelback of rap
anybody
anybody disagree
drake is the nickelback of rap
here's my take on on drake
now keep in mind
that art is subjective
so if i say i don't enjoy a speci
specific artist it doesn't mean they're
not great
it's just a personal thing right
so uh
so drake is obviously hugely successful
and people love him
but when i listen to him i can't stand
it
i can't stand 10 seconds of that guy
his board droning that they call some
kind of performance he feels like to me
drake comes off as somebody who wanted
to sing but they didn't didn't have the
energy for it
i'd really like to sing like adele but
i think all i can do is say this
and i'll call it a sound
i am rapping now
aren't we all energized
by my
rapping words
no no
i i get that most of the world who likes
uh this
this genre of music thinks she's pretty
great
but i don't see it at all
you know i love kanye yeah there's lots
of stuff in the genre that i like a lot
so it's not like i'm you know ragging on
the genre at all
i like the genre
i just don't get
i just don't get drake
but i
you know i'm completely aware that
people love them so and that's fine
all right um
uh the funniest thing from the jesse
smullet case was
was it
was it one of the uh nigerian twins
who claimed he didn't know the bath
house was for for gay stuff
[Laughter]
i wonder how long it took him to figure
it out
so here's here's a little information
for any nigerian
immigrants who come to this country and
are confused by bath houses i'm pretty
sure there are no heterosexual bath
houses
am i wrong about that
is there any such thing as a
heterosexual bath house
in the united states
in europe yeah but not in the united
states right
oh it's called the why
somebody says
but
uh just the
just the fact that and apparently there
was like gay pornography on the walls of
the private room they went to and
maybe they had some physical contact
says jesse but maybe they didn't says
one of the one of the twins
but i just love the fact that he didn't
know it was a place that gay people went
uh so there's this uh we have a result
in the case of
uh the guy who claims to be the inventor
of bitcoin
you thought it was satoshi right the
uh
the secret name of whoever did it but
somebody a australian computer scientist
named craig wright
he actually won a miami civil case
that pitted him against
the family of his late business partner
and i guess the business partner was
claiming he was also
a part inventor but he lost that
so craig wright
um that doesn't mean he's the inventor
but he said if he lost the case he would
reveal that
all of his holdings and show that he was
really satoshi i guess but he didn't
he didn't lose so he didn't have to do
that
so we still don't quite know if he is
what do you think
do you
uh
oh craig's been debunked in the crypto
world for years somebody says
he's not the inventor
all right i i'm uh i'm going to say i'm
skeptical of his claim but i don't have
any insight into it at all
seems like it'd be easy to prove
because he'd have a few billion dollars
to play with wouldn't he
if if craig wright is not living like a
billionaire i've got some questions
about his claim
all right
so let's talk about rapid tests
we still don't have cheap rapid tests we
have rapid tests but they're way
expensive
and
jen saki
answered a question about rapid tests by
mocking the reporter
and saying you know
what do you think we should do
send out a
rapid test to every household
to which everybody smart thought
yes
yes
that's pretty much exactly what we're
asking
because otherwise you can't get past the
pandemic
so yes
yes
and and why is she mocking
literally the only way past the pandemic
that i can see
i don't know but
there is some intrigue over the question
of why the u.s alone was unable to do
this thing that we would normally be
good at
which is approving stuff in a pandemic
you know we we did these vaccinations if
you call them that in the pandemic
so obviously we had the capability to do
this
don't you think
and it's being blamed on incompetence
and bureaucracy
i don't know
i'm not buying it
sorry
don't buy it for a second
clearly there's corruption going on here
somewhere i don't know who i don't know
where
but clearly this is corruption
and if there's nobody digging into this
to find out you know what's going on
ah
you know
this is a big miss i mean i i think
there's there's awards for somebody who
gets to the bottom of this
now the obvious question is how can we
the public
know which of the decision makers in the
government are associated with any of
the pharma companies
i did read an article that said that the
gentleman who's
responsible for recommending which rapid
tests are
are considered or whatever
uh he did have some uh
association with abbott in the past
but we don't know that he owns any stock
i think he doesn't
but he had a close association with the
only one that got quickly approved in
the past he'd done some work with them
so
that seems like something i'd want to
know more about
wouldn't you
and i would just put this out there
the way that people um
do illegal things is not just by owning
the stock
you could have a family member own the
stock and i don't know that anybody
would know would they
if your spouse owned the stock but you
didn't would anybody know
how about if it was your brother would
anybody know
the sec would know
if it's a spouse
how about this
suppose this gentleman wanted to go
do some work for abbott in the future
after after making them 1.9 billion
dollars on rapid tests
do you think he would get that job do
you think abbott would say yeah you're
hired
you just made us 1.9 billion dollars
there thanks
we will hire you to consult for any
price you want
what do you think
now
the trouble is then that wouldn't be
illegal would it
it wouldn't be illegal simply to
understand
that if he worked for abbott in the
future they would be likely to say yes
to whatever he offered
that's not illegal
is it
so
there are a whole bay a whole bunch of
ways corruption can happen in this
situation and they don't all involve
owning stock
so
follow the money but it gets really hard
to follow it when you're talking about
just
understood arrangements let me give you
another example
let's say that the
person responsible for the rapid tests
in the government
did not accept any money from anybody
did not own any stock
but he knew that he was going to start a
startup soon
and he might want one of the existing
pharma companies to
foot the money
could you could you detect that
is there any way to find out that there
was a private conversation in which
somebody said you know
if you give us a little uh runway here
on these
rapid tests
we're likely to uh fund your startup
should you have one in the future now i
don't think anybody said that
like i'm not i'm not alleging that
anything like that happened i'm just
saying that there are a thousand ways
to be corrupt
that would be hard to
detect right
so i'm not mind reading i'm speculating
about possibilities mind reading would
be
i know what happened
speculating would be
you know there are a hundred ways that
this could go wrong
we better look into it
all right so i got big big questions on
that and that looks like corruption to
me
uh weirdly the white house
there was some kind of uh
i guess a committee that came up with
some recommendations and the white house
ended up flagging uh the art industry
as a special industry where there's a
lot of corruption
because you can launder money through
art just by overpaying for art basically
so you just pay too much for art and you
can get your illegal money back into the
legal system
which is what laundering does
and
they're they're flagging our industry as
a as a money laundering
entity at the same time hunter biden
is selling uh his artwork for half a
million dollars to anonymous buyers
how in the world can both these things
be happening at the same time now
the obvious question to be asked here
is
is there anything that hunter couldn't
get away with at this point
that he could do right in front of you
because hunter's alleged
improprieties
are kind of well known right
we know all of his connections to
everything
you know
it's almost transparent
and then we see this the art thing which
looks
you know super corrupt
but it's all public you know we won't
know who the buyers are but we know what
the situation is
and
i have to ask
does hunter biden even need to show
identification when he goes to a bank
or can he just walk behind the counter
go into the vault
load up a pallet with dollars and and
walk out with it
and then somebody will say well we've
got this story about hunter biden you
walked into a bank and took a pallet of
cash
and then you're waiting for the rest of
the story where he gets indicted and
arrested
it just doesn't happen
and then you check back tomorrow and say
oh man he's going to be indicted and
while he's not indicted
is there anything this guy could do
what exactly would it take
for him to be you know
stopped
so we were defunding the police at the
same time hunters running wild
not really a related story but it was
funny
all right so we should do a tweet on
what could the hunter get away with
based on what he's already getting away
with
i don't know that there's any limit
remember when trump said he could choose
somebody on fifth avenue
i think under biden could
shoot somebody on
fifth avenue
have sex with the
with the dead body
snort coke off the corpse
in front of a hundred cameras
and the news would say
better get your vaccinations
all right
um
i will tell you for the anybody who's
new i'm not gonna i i'm not the guy who
tells you to get vaccinated it's a
personal decision and i don't care if
you do okay
so when i talk about stuff i'm talking
about the logic of it i'm not trying to
convince you of anything
so just keep that in mind but here's the
things that we all know
um and i think we all know this so this
this would be based on the
the consensus of science
so when i say we all know it
what i mean is that we know that science
is telling us is true which is different
from being true
we all know that right
but this is what they tell us is true
that the vaccinations greatly reduce
your risk of
of hospitalization and death
and that they reduce the spread but they
don't stop it
now that's
that's
the bs starts now
goodbye andrew for being an
 get banned
anybody else want to make a
comment about what i'm secretly thinking
anybody
all right
so the rest of you maybe could be adults
and just listen to it before you decide
that i'm secretly trying to convince you
to get the vaccination
 idiots
all right uh
so according to the experts it reduces
your hospitalization and death
risk to practically nothing
from practically nothing because it
wasn't that hard to start
and that the rate of the spread would be
less
now people quite reasonably said show me
your work how can you say this where are
those studies
to which i say don't ask me for studies
i don't believe any studies i'm telling
you what the experts say
right that's what they say
ask them for studies
all right
but then people keep saying that the
jabs don't work
what
why would you say they don't work if you
know
that basically a hundred percent of
experts say
that it prevents you from dying or
getting badly hospitalized
why would you say they don't work
that's
that's word thinking so in my book loser
think i talk about this
word thinking is that you're trying to
take a definition
and change the definition or or use a
definition the way you want and you
think that wins an argument
it doesn't
it's just a word you put on something
so if you want to say the fact the the
vaccination doesn't doesn't work
that just means you've defined working a
different way
we all know that it doesn't stop
the
the virus right there's there's nobody
who's confused about that
we know you can still get it if you're
vaccinated
right everybody knows that but why would
you say it doesn't work
according to the science because the
people who say it doesn't work
are pointing to the studies in the
science but the science says it works
now
if anybody's coming in late
i'm not telling you to get vaccinated
i'm not telling you not to i'm just
talking about what we know and what we
don't you make your own decisions
now this is the worst argument against
the vaccinations to say they don't work
would you like a good argument
anybody
i'm going to give you the good argument
for not getting vaccinated
all right
here's the good argument for not getting
vaccinated
nobody knows what the side effects are
you think you're in a demographic that
doesn't have much risk
you think natural immunity is going to
be better than a vaccination
and you think the government is a liar
and you think that the companies are
liars
and that they're not telling you all the
risks
that's a pretty good argument
now it's not the argument that i agree
with
because my own risk is different than
your risk etc so my decision about
vaccinations shouldn't match yours
you should make your own
but
the bad argument is they don't work
when you say they don't work you don't
sound smart honestly that that sounds
just under informed
because i'm pretty sure we'd know
if they didn't make any effect
like it seems really clear that the
hospitalizations and deaths go way down
now
what do we know about the side effects
some of you say but but the vares
database
that's a bad argument
that might be right
but it's a bad argument because the
vera's database is not meant to do the
thing that you're doing with it which is
looking at it and saying hey
i guess that's strong evidence that
there's problems it's not meant for that
and we don't we have no confidence that
that it's accurate and once and once
just everybody gets vaccinated
every problem you have will come soon
after getting vaccinated right
so especially if you have the uh
so condescending
tree inside says so condescending what
what is condescending
i'm talking about the arguments not the
people
the arguments
can suck
but the people can be awesome
are you okay with that
i'm not
i'm not saying that you're dumb
or that you're making a wrong decision
i'm not saying that i'm saying that
there's good arguments and bad arguments
and
and i would like to equate you with the
good arguments so that you can be good
people with good arguments whichever way
you go
use the good argument okay
don't use the bad argument it makes you
less likely to persuade
use the good one
now
to me it comes down to your unknown risk
of the virus itself
compared to the unknown risk of the
vaccinations
how many of you think you know which is
the bigger risk no
not not guessing not assuming not not a
hunch but how many of you think you know
which is the biggest risk the
vaccination itself
or the vet or the the virus itself
how many of you know which one is the
bigger risk
no one does no one does
no somebody says catching the virus
obviously not obviously
what do you mean obviously
how in the world could that be obvious
uh no idea unknowable yeah so everybody
says it's unknowable that's the right
answer
now given that that's the number one
biggest variable
well let me ask this question is is the
side effect risk
or the long-term risk of the virus
versus the
vaccine
plus the short-term risk
do you do you feel you understand those
risks
anyway
let me ask this question do you think
that the risks
of the vaccination itself do you think
that that's the biggest variable
in your decision is the risk of the
vaccination
hurting you itself is that the biggest
variable in your decision
compared to the risk of the virus itself
no so if it's not your biggest variable
what is a bigger variable than that
somebody tell me
for those of you who say that the risk
from the vaccination is not the biggest
variable what is what is the biggest
variable
your health but i mean that's in all the
decisions your age
no i mean we're adjusting for age and
stuff so assuming everybody's made the
made a decision about their
co-morbidities and their age and all
that
but that's
you know that's baked into it
but once you've done that
isn't your biggest variable the risk
easy travel oh okay some people say that
they just did it for the travel but that
also assumes that
it wasn't a big risk
for the vaccination in your mind
um
supporting a safety obsessed world okay
that would be a philosophical objection
got
it um
it's a chinese bio weapon being injected
into you
but
uh the virus is a chinese bio weapon
i don't know what the vaccination is
all right
well all of you are much more reasonable
than i was
uh expecting actually so good for you
and
um see what else is going on
what would
what would happen when a 100 percent of
people in any place get vaccinated
what would happen in a place where 100
are vaccinated what would happen to the
affairs reporting
what do you think so the vares database
has the adverse reactions
that's where people report them now it's
not scientific it's just anecdotal
reports but when everybody is vaccinated
what would the vares database say
wouldn't it say that
everything that
is unexplained is
caused by the vaccination
so you should expect
that no matter how many people get
vaccinated the number of people infected
should go up
does everybody get that
that if everything is the way the
scientists understand that the
vaccinations
you know reduce the length of time you
have it and your hospitalizations and
your death rates
um
if if everything about that is true
what would you expect
you would expect the vera's database to
go through the roof right
the more people who are vaccinated
the more the various
rate will go up but you understand that
that would go up whether or not the
vaccinations were causing problems
how many of you understand that
that no matter what
as more people get vaccinated the vares
database report should go through the
roof
even if the vaccinations were perfectly
safe does everybody get
that is there anybody who doesn't
understand that the vares database will
go through the roof
no matter what
it doesn't have an option of doing
anything else
right it would be correlation not
causation but there isn't any way the
varus database can't go way up
no matter what the vaccinations are
doing
right
jfk junior shows up when we get to 100
percent
um
versus
doctors won't support an adverse report
that has passed two weeks of acts okay
doesn't change my point
yeah it should skyrocket no matter what
because we're all talking about it
the fact that it's in national
conversation should make the reports go
through the roof and the fact that so
many people are now vaccinated
that should also make it go through the
roof even if
the vaccinations don't hurt anybody
right
so most of the people i see arguing on
the internet don't seem to understand
that the varus database has to go up if
if everything we know about human beings
and math
is true
it has to go up it has to go up a lot
and it has to go up fast
it doesn't mean anything
it could mean something but it doesn't
necessarily mean something all right
and that
is just about what i wanted to tell you
today
all right
scott we aren't idiots
you know i think the people watching
this live stream are more informed and
better thinkers than the people who are
just random twitter users in the public
how many of you would agree with that
statement
because most of what we talk about is
how to think about stuff better if you
spend enough time learning to think
you're going to be better at it
yeah and locals it's almost all yeses
and here on youtube there are more
people just wandering in for the first
time so it's going to be a little
different
yeah you know what when i was you know
talking about the varus database i was
kind of expecting a pushback
but i didn't get it
because i think you're all smarter than
the average
at this point
you are geniuses and if i may say so
inexplicably sexy
and that's not just for the
people who like smart people
um better looking
and sexier yeah it's true
um
yum
i don't ever learned how to think from a
cartoonist lol
well
apparently you're right
one of the comments on youtube was
that he doesn't learn how to how to
think from a cartoonist
to which i say i'll bet that's true
i'll bet you have not learned how to
think
so
um i'm gonna say goodbye to uh youtube
i'm gonna spend a minute here with
my locals people
and i will talk to you tomorrow
