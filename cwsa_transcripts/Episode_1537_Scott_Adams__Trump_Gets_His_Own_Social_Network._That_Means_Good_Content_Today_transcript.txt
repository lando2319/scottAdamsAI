waking up
it's true they go to sleep at night but
now they're awake
well here's the biggest news
uh looks like it's gonna rain
now that doesn't seem like big news to
you
wherever you live
well i live in california
and it's gonna rain
oh god that's good news
apparently it's gonna rain a lot
like a ton of rain coming our way
like lots and lots of rain
well we can't get enough and that's good
news
so i like it when problems
sort of solve themselves
do we have any yeah oh sure there might
be some mudslides
pessimists
pessimists like how about mudslides yeah
there might be mudslides
but i'd rather have water
well here's the fake news you ready for
the fake news cnn has a good dose of
fake news i'll read the what they wrote
and then you tell me what is the fake
part okay
what is the fake part of this news cnn
says
a booster dose of the pfizer blah blah
coronavirus vaccine was found to have a
high efficacy
can we all
i gotta take a little aside
road here
can we all agree on one thing
i know we're
there's a lot of uh division in the
country
might even be a little division on this
live stream
but if there's one thing we can all
agree on
please
it's that
pronouncing the word
efficacy
is really fun
it makes you feel good when you say it
makes you feel smart try it try it at
home
just say out loud
efficacy
yeah
yeah did you feel it
it's not like other words
it's fun to say
and it makes you feel like you're really
on top of your game
if you can pronounce
efficacy
you know nicely
you look like you're well practically a
scientist now you're not
any virologist probably
but you just learned to say
efficacy just right
well anyway back to my story of fake
news from cnn a booster dose of the
pfizer blah blah coronavirus vaccine was
found to have a high
efficacy
of 95.6 percent
um and that's in the phase three trial
and the company announced that the
efficacy was consistent irrespective of
age sex race ethnicity and
co-morbid conditions
oh i like this new word
comorbid conditions because i've been
saying comor comorbidities
comorbidities is a cool word it's no
it's no efficacy i think we can agree on
that
but i like saying it so i'm going to say
comorbid conditions now
to make me sound smart all right what's
the fake news
what's the fake news
anybody anybody what's the fake news
i'm going to take it as true
let's see i will stipulate
that the 95.6
efficacy is accurate but what's the fake
part where's the fake news come on you
know
you know where it is
nobody really
i thought this would be would be easier
all right um
let me tell you
it's not the day one efficacy that
anybody cares about
am i wrong
who is it who is really obsessing about
day one efficacy
it's not a day one efficacy story
it's a how fast does it wear off story
am i wrong
the story is how long it lasts
and that's not in the story
because obviously they can't know that
because it's new
this is the this is just disgusting fake
news
because they've they led you to believe
that the thing they told you is the
important thing and it's not
it's not i mean it's great that the
efficacy is that high it's actually
impressive and whoever came up with this
uh
let's say kovind shot
i don't like to call it a vaccine for
reasons you understand
but it's still a miracle
i mean if it does this it's kind of a
miracle so it's it's amazing
but
you know assuming it doesn't kill you
but um i feel like they
they didn't tell us the actual story
because that's the part that matters how
long it lasts now they don't know
but i feel like they have to at least
mention it
all right
um how many of you saw me
interview
bjorn lomborg so
i did that not on a live stream i did it
on a recorded interview so i could have
a proper
two screen situation without technical
problems
and that's that's posted now on youtube
so just search for
uh if you just search for bjorn lomborg
and my name it'll pop right up
and
you really should take the time
you should take the time
look at the other comments you'll see
that people enjoyed it a lot
and very similar in
uh let's say in theme to a lot of things
you see from michael schellenberger
sort of the the smarter way to look at
climate and
nuclear energy and stuff like that
but lomborg's been saying this for i
don't know
a long time
he's been on on this for a long time and
he's just a great explainer
so if you want to see somebody who
understands statistics and business and
risk management
you gotta see lobborg right so
i don't like
let me let me say this as clearly as
possible
i don't really enjoy
interviewing other people
because
the fun part is when i'm talking
but i'm also completely aware
that
you're not in it for my fun
you know you don't watch this because
i'm having fun you you're looking for
some benefit for yourself quite
naturally
and it does seem to me that the
especially the author interviews
let me get can i give some
um i need some career advice
let me take a pause here i need some
career advice and this is serious
this is serious questions career advice
i don't love interviewing
authors because of the homework you kind
of have to read the book
right i mean you don't have to
but
it's it's a reasonable courtesy and
expectation
especially if it's a recorded interview
and you're just going to do that with
the author you kind of got to read the
book
so reading books and then interviewing
people is i don't know
10 times harder than what i like to do
every day
which is this
i don't know if you can tell
but i would do this
just for fun
literally
literally this experience
is just purely fun for me
but the author interviews take more
concentration and work however i think
they're more useful
all right here's the part
that i can only say in public because i
have no sense of shame whatsoever
which is a big advantage in life
i'm going to say something that nobody
should say out loud
if they had any sense of dignity or
shame or you know self-preservation all
right i'm just i'm just going to say it
out loud
i think i'm the best in the world
at interviewing people
you're just gonna have to deal with that
for a moment
now
i don't know that to be true right if i
had certainty about it i'd be crazy but
based on my uh experience of just
interviewing a few people i don't think
anybody does it the way i do it
and i think it has more to do with the
way i do it
than you know some natural quality i
possess or something like that so it's
not so much about me being awesome
and that's the part that keeps people
from saying something like that in
public
i actually think i might be the best in
the world with this
and i don't know why exactly could be
that i
i don't have as much partisanship it
could be that the windows that i use to
look at things are
a little bit different or something
somebody says joe rogan is hard to beat
let me make a statement and i'll leave
no ambiguity here whatsoever
i'm way better than joe rogan at
interviewing people it's not even close
joe rogan
is a show
in which you know you've got three hours
of content and he's great at it you know
maybe the best ever
maybe the best ever if you just look at
his success and his audience and the
impact he has i think you could say joe
rogan's show
is the best ever of you know anything in
that genre
but in the narrow question of just doing
an interview
you don't do a three-hour interview
you can do three hours of content
yeah i mean he does that great but an
interview needs to be shorter
right so if you're just going to do one
one interview 45 minutes is a lot for an
interview
a narcissist compensates with false
bravado
oh you're talking about somebody else
not me but you can call me a narcissist
too
that would be fine but just be specific
i'm a grandiose narcissist
not a vulnerable narcissist well as far
as i know i mean
couldn't be wrong about that
but as far as i know i'm i'm the kind of
narcissist that likes to get stuff done
and then if i get credit for that
that's great
i like it
but i but i need to do things that are
legitimately useful for other people
or i don't get anything
so
moving along all right i see your
comment
um
but what was the answer then should i do
more author interviews one question and
then i'll move on should i do more
author interviews
local's platform says absolutely yes yes
yes
away for a moment
youtube's a little mixed
no no yes no
ah
yes yes yes no no no
okay in a question like this only the
yeses matter
here's a little uh tip for you about how
to judge
public opinion on entertainment stuff
this is a really good tip
learn this and you'll you'll have
something to take with you
so i'm looking at the youtube messages
and it's a mixture of yeses and no's
so what should that tell me about
whether i should do this
it's an absolute yes
based on the feedback because it doesn't
matter how many people say no
this is the key learning
it doesn't matter how many people
wouldn't watch it it has nothing to do
with whether you should do it the only
thing that matters is how many would
because there's a lot of people
if if five billion people hate you
but a billion people love you
you're in a pretty good position if
you've got a billion people on your side
even the 5 billion hate you so it has
nothing to do with how many people don't
want to watch you
irrelevant
all right
um
yeah so also i was on uh viven barnes
yesterday you should google that that
was a lot of fun if you missed me on
viva and barnes
you're going to want to at least stay
for how i addressed the first
troll who had a comment because i might
have lost my
i might have lost my composure
so if you like if you like to watch
things where
people lose their composure
you want to watch that one
you might like it
well the big news today is that trump is
launching a social media network called
truth social media
they're saying that so far it's uh
they're opening it up for beta
beta users
so
so trump's network will be open for beta
users
um
there is some suggestion that later
conservatives will also be able to use
it
but for now apparently you have to be a
beta
to use it um so i said it was just all
mostly democrats
i don't know
am i reading too much into this
oh oh oh a beta i'm sorry i
misinterpreted this it's it's the
technology is the beta
it's the technology that okay
i thought it was just for betas
um
one of my weirdest predictions
might be
about ready to come true i'm not sure
yet so i don't have confidence in it but
here's one of my weirdest predictions
trump would lose money as president
and make it back after he was out of
office and and ten times more
so when everybody said uh i think
running for president is really bad for
your company and it was it was terrible
for the trump uh
company i assume you know it's a private
company but one assumes looking from the
outside it was just terrible for
business
but now he's launched this new media
platform i assume he has equity right
has anybody seen any reporting
on the degree of equity that trump has
versus his partners
i don't think i've seen that
but one assumes he has you know a good
chunk of equity
and
what is the best way to become a
multi-billionaire in the united states
it's this
somehow trump managed to have equity in
the type of company now we don't know if
this one will work per se
but in the type of company that makes
you a multi-billionaire right away
he could be one year away from being one
of the richest people in the country
again
and i i always assumed that he would
find a way to monetize
you know his
reputation and everything else and maybe
this is it you know you you can't really
bet on any newish platform succeeding i
think the odds are always against it but
he's bringing something that nobody ever
brought before which is himself
and if people just sign up just so they
can see what he's saying
imagine if he runs for president which
seems likely
and the only place you can see the good
stuff is on his his platform
you have to sign up right
if the only place you can see his like
extra good stuff is on his own platform
every reporter has to sign up basically
every pundit
everybody who watches you all have to
sign up
so he does have
kind of a perfect setup
which doesn't mean it's going to succeed
but the setup is kind of perfect
i've already put in my name so
there's a site where you can go to to
sign up to be invited or not so i put in
my name
i was looking at the uh
michael schellenberger tweet talking
about greta tunberg who was quoted in
the past as saying quote i want you to
panic
so
greta and of course other people
literally wanted people to panic about
the climate change stuff
and
unfortunately i think they succeeded
it looks like they succeeded in getting
people to panic
so sort of a be careful what you wish
for a situation
because
um
i've said the best i've said the best
situation if climate change is really as
dangerous as people say or any version
of it is
um
you need a little bit of panic don't you
like there's some productive amount of
fear
that gets you to do the right things so
you're not in trouble in the future
but maybe we overshot the mark we may
have over panicked it's hard to know
what is the exact right amount of panic
well i think it's time to fire pete
butterjudge
um and i'm i'm reasonably pro-booted
judge and i'm also reasonably not
reasonably i'm pro-paternal
leave right wouldn't want to threaten
you know the
the idea that people can have you know
parental leave
um but at the same time it is maybe the
biggest problem in the country
and i don't think anybody's in charge
are they
is anybody in charge
i saw on twitter somebody saying that
the
the secretary of transportation is not
really the person who's the right person
to fix
the the trucking slash
problem
is that true
can somebody tell me that just the first
question is is buddha judge does even
have the portfolio and the power to be
in charge of this problem
because that's a good question
right and if it's not him
who is it
and if we don't know who it is and it's
the biggest problem it's not the
president the president doesn't seem
involved in any way
who's working on the biggest problem
i feel like
bootage has taken some responsibility
for it hasn't he
somebody says power yes but portfolio no
i think that's the right answer
i think the answer is that buddha judge
could take control of it
you know he could sort of
uh i'm sure he could get by them to
assign him the job of you know
transportation
czar of trucking and
logistics or something
so
i i think you're right that maybe is his
job description is not exactly on point
but in a crisis it seems like he would
be the one that you'd pick
now let me ask you this
if trump were president how would this
supply chain problem look different
i feel like trump would have solved this
by now
i also feel
a hashtag coming on
it's a little too long but something
along the lines of trump would have
solved this by now
because it you know look at the
the border problem
trump would have solved that by now
there are a few things that we see that
just look like obviously trump would be
the better choice
if only because he would be engaged and
biden doesn't seem to be
look at what trump might have done right
we're just speculating here because we
don't know
but
here's something he might have done
trump might have fired somebody
right
he might have fired somebody i don't
know if that's buddha judge or somebody
else but i think you have to fire
somebody
like
i feel like it now maybe there's nobody
who's quite on point to be the right one
to fire but if there's nobody to fire
then at least you need to pick a czar to
be in charge
so you have somebody to fire later right
i think trump would have written some
executive orders to override some any
state
regulations that were slowing things
down
and now i've heard things such as there
are not enough trucks
because of environmental concerns of old
trucks in california
do you think trump couldn't solve that
problem
one eo
just says well
temporarily you can use any truck you
want
just temporarily because it's a crisis
you don't think trump would have done
that
just signed something that says
temporarily we're not going to worry
about california's
regulations now it could be that the
trucks just don't exist
you know maybe the older trucks have
been decommissioned and whatever else so
maybe there's just no play there i don't
know
but why don't we know that
because nobody's in charge
there's nobody in the government
who says i'm in charge
let me give you an update here's what
we're doing here's what's wrong we've
identified the problem here's the
solution we're working on it might take
us a little time but we've identified
the problem somebody's in charge and
here's the solution we we think will
work
where is all that
right
where's all of that
at the very least i think a trump
administration would be keeping you up
to date
on what the hell is happening
or even tell you what the problem was
so i've been asking
everybody for days now
describe what exactly is the problem
and
luckily people who are well informed the
number of people who work in the field
and are involved with logistics some of
them you know have interviewed employees
at the docs and with all this
information finally
finally i got really clear
detailed
answer to why things are slowing down
unfortunately
all of the really clear
detailed answers of why
the supply chain isn't working
were different
that's right
lots of experts waiting people really
know that they're actually working on it
right now the people in the field doing
logistics doing the shipping you know
unloading them the people who are close
to it they really know and so they told
me what the problem was
lots of them
all different
what's that mean
what's it mean when everybody knows the
problem but they'll have a different
answer
what's that mean
well the the smallest amount it means is
that there's something going on
you know what it feels like
i don't think it is so don't take this
as a conspiracy let me tell you what it
feels like tell me actually see if
anybody else says the same thing what
what does it feel like is the problem
not really
you know there's no evidence of this but
what's it feel like
boom
uh
tim amaka on locals
got the right answer
war
it feels like
when the twin towers got hit with
airplanes
and he didn't quite know who was doing
it or who was behind it
it feels like war
specifically let's see if you can take
it to the next level so war is the right
answer
take it to the next level
give me another detail on that
somebody says china
give me another detail
all right i'm not i'm not alleging this
all right there there's no allegation
i'm just saying how it feels
there there's one thing i'm looking for
here
i haven't seen it yet
there we go somebody got it
i knew i knew you'd get it uh david
i think david said it first on locals
uh it looks like a cyber attack
i'll i'll even take it to another level
uh i'm accepting cyber as you know close
enough
looks like an ai attack
yeah what did that just do to your brain
right
first time you heard that
i don't think anybody else has mentioned
it this feels like
an a.i
attack
so it feels like now i would not allege
that because i think you'd you'd have to
have some kind of direct evidence to say
that
but
if we ever get an ai attack
what's it going to look like
it's going to look like a whole bunch of
things seem to stop working right at
about the same time
it's going to look like we can't quite
identify
the source of the problem but our
systems aren't working
the things that used to be smooth just
stop being smooth and we don't know why
now again let me be very clear i'm not
alleging
that this is some kind of a ai attack
i'm only alleging
that it would feel and look exactly like
this
i don't think you'd know you'd be
attacked when you think of an ai attack
you think they're going to turn the
lights off
or you think they're going to you know
break uh
the hydroelectric dam or something you
know you think of it like a terrorist
attack
but i think ai would attack without
telling you they're attacking
what's the point of having artificial
intelligence if if it's dumb
right you don't want dumb ai that's no
good a smart ai i wouldn't tell you it's
attacking would it it'd be a sneak
attack
so an ai attack that you know was worth
anything would be a sneak attack because
you don't want um
you don't want some kind of a response
what did i do to your brains today
because the for the first time you
realize that and again i'm not saying
this is an ai attack the first time you
realize that this is what it would look
like
and how it would feel
is
disconcerting isn't it
pretty disconcerting
now
let me add a little meat to that the way
an ai attack would work
would be just to hit enough systems that
are related to the same process in this
case the supply chain to have enough
misinformation
and enough persuasion just inserted at
the right points there's several things
seem to be breaking at the same time and
you wouldn't know why
just a little everything's just a little
bit broken
you know nothing exploded
just everything's a little bit broken
and then the supply chain just goes
crazy
all right um
newsweek had a story today in which
they referred to the fine people
hoax
but linked to an article that seemed to
treat it like it was true
now i was informed that newsweek did in
fact put the clarifying statement in
there that trump said he wasn't talking
about the neo-nazis
but in
in its entirety
and with the link
they're still spreading the fine people
hoax in 2021 the most debunked hoax of
all time
still being at least couched in a way
that
they're making it look like maybe it was
true
based on the linked linked article
and
so i said to myself how could you not
know that in 2021 so i googled it
google
uh you just use google
and google find
people hoax
and put a plus in front of hoax so you
make sure that an article should comes
up that says hoax
do you know what will come up
articles that say it's true
and don't have the word hoax in
now i only did this quickly so i didn't
confirm this but i think that's true i
think the top searches
for the thing that requires the word
hoax to be in it don't have the word
hoax in it you have to go down pretty
far to get something from politico or
from me
right
try it yourself and just can somebody
confirm that so this is an unconfirmed
claim i'm claiming because i didn't open
all the articles but i doubt those
articles had the word hoax in it
i kind of doubt it
they it feels like they're artificially
pinned to the top
not sure
but it looked like it
all right
so um
do you know robert everybody know robert
reich
economist and uh democrat
and he's a super partisan you know
tweeter and
pretty active on social media
and here's my problem with him
i think it's because he's an economist
that i have more problem with his bias
than i do with other people's
you know if you see a politician or
somebody's working for a politician or
clearly an activist and they say things
that are just amazingly biased and
one-sided and
basically just looks like a lie
you say to yourself well they're a
politician or they're working for a
politician and you you sort of discount
it as being just ridiculous
but when
when a famous
you know at least notable
economist says something you you try to
think well
you know at least maybe he's right about
that
but he is so
insanely biased
that it just disgusts me when i see his
tweets
because i hate to see somebody who's an
economist
uh like
throw his entire profession under a bus
if you're an economist and you can't
treat things objectively
you need to give your degree back
right you should just give it back
because you didn't earn an economics
degree
if you can't even attempt to be a little
unbiased
all right so he tweeted he said there's
something talking about the uh
the bill to uh strengthen the voting
rights that got rejected
so congress rejected it but there were
enough people to have gotten a majority
but not enough to beat a filibuster i
think most of you are well educated on
the
process but if anybody isn't
most bills you could get passed with a
simple majority
you know 51 percent or whatever
but for some things you need more than
that you know a super majority if you're
trying to be a filibuster the filibuster
is just one party usually i think always
the minority party
uh just trying to use the procedural
right to talk forever to delay things
until you know you can't get anything
passed
and righteous things he says he tweets
there's something terribly wrong with
the system that allows 41 senate
republicans representing only 21 of the
country
to block voting rights legislation
supported by nearly 70 percent of
americans
the filibuster must go
god
he's so slimy
i so slimy
all right here's the problem with this
how many of americans actually
understand what's in the voting rights
bill
what do you think
he says 70 are in favor of this bill how
many you think know what's in the bill
zero
zero
because democrats always make
complicated bills that you can't
understand
the infrastructure bill 3.5 trillion how
many americans knew what was in that
zero
how many people know what's in the uh
the voting rights bill
none
none
nobody
so robert reich
you slimy piece of
you know
suggesting that somehow 70 of americans
wanting
this or wanting voting rights in general
is somehow in favor of this specific
bill
this is not the case and you know it
so when i see somebody lie
i mean this is just
well lies may be the wrong word here
let's say
persuade in such a biased way
it just discredits
economists and i hate that
you know the economists
certainly not right all the time
but they don't need this
all right
so
it appears that democrats have a
two-pronged strategy
uh
and uh that's that's pretty interesting
the first prong is to get rid of the
filibuster now you're hearing a lot of
talk about that right so democrats
are the party in power but they can't
get things done because of this darn
filibuster the republicans keep using
so step one is a lot of democrats want
to get rid of the filibuster
step one is their clever plan
step two of their plan
is to botch one thing after another
until the party empowers the republicans
so step one
give whoever the party in power is all
the power and by getting rid of the
filibuster step two make sure that the
other party is in power and has all that
power with no filibuster
isn't that what's happening
am i wrong
i'm not wrong right
that they explicitly have those two
goals well the first one is explicit get
rid of the filibuster
but
it does look like every single force is
suggesting that the republicans will
retake power
right
i mean at least congress in 2022
so
shouldn't getting rid of the filibuster
be really close to the last thing they
would want right now
i know how can you support a party that
has this as
their plan
to give all the power to the other side
i'm not making this up
you're seeing the same thing i see right
you
there there's no there's no debate on
these two facts democrats want to get
rid of the filibuster many of them the
ones the ones we see talking public at
the same time
it's pretty clear that the performance
we're getting of the democrats will put
republicans in power
they know that too don't they
don't they know that
maybe they don't
all right
so here's cnn helping the public
understand what's in the bill
finally
you know it's a complicated bill with a
lot of stuff in it and i'd like to
understand it better and so for the
benefit of my viewers here i'm going to
read cnn's description
so that all of you will finally know
what's in this complicated bill are you
ready this should answer all of your
questions
um as written the current compromise
version this is one mansion put together
of the bill would establish national
rules for running elections
sounds good
limit partisanship in the drawing of
congressional districts
looks good looks good
and
forced the disclosure of many anonymous
donors who spend big to influence
elections
i like that
pretty good pretty good
other provisions were aimed at
alleviating concerns from local
election officials
who worried that the original bill would
have been too difficult to implement
okay so they simplified it good
and some new editions were aimed at
insulating non-partisan
i don't know what that means
blah blah blah it also included a number
of changes sought by mansion blah blah
blah including a provision that would
limit but not prohibit state voter id
requirements
do you think you know enough about the
bill now to have an opinion
no
no
not even close
basically cnn's just sort of like
brushing the top of it
they might as they might as well have
named uh the parts of the bill
awesome things that everybody loves
how would you like a bill
we're going to fill it
with awesome things that everyone loves
oh don't ask the details
no don't ask about the details don't ask
how it will be implemented what the what
the cost of it is what the side effects
will be and how it will distort anything
don't ask that
it's just called the awesome bill that
everybody loves with things in it that
you want
that's all you need to know
don't give us all this details about
what's good or bad about it or all that
it's just the awesome bill that
everybody loves
and then democrats can get everything
they want
so
there is a reason that our system is a
republic do you remember what it was
anybody anybody
why is our system a republic and not a
pure democracy
this this
this is why
because the public can't understand this
stuff
so if our elected officials um go in
there you know they have a better chance
of understanding it that doesn't work so
well either
but uh yeah there's a reason we're a
republic
did you see the video of jeremy raskin
democrat interrogating republican matt
gates
about the january sex stuff
it's it's a pretty good clip so if you
get a chance i think i tweeted it today
so rascal is really going hard at matt
gates challenging him to
does he believe that
trump won the election
or not
now to his credit matt gates is i don't
know if you know this but he he was a i
think he was like a state champion
uh on his high school debate team
i may have the detail of that wrong but
something like that like matt gates is
super good
at debating things and holding his own
and exactly this kind of situation
however
um
i think i think he blew his
his chance on this
he did better than most
probably a top five percent answer
better than most
yeah and and certainly showed showed
that he has the uh you know the the
chops to be in that situation
but
i feel like here's how i would have
answered it okay so raskin i'm gonna
paraphrase you know the the thing
but essentially raskin was saying you
know all these courts rejected the
evidence so how can you say that maybe
the election wasn't fair when so many
courts rejected all the evidence
now what matt gates tried to do
was suggest that courts are not the
right tool
for evaluating the claims because most
of them were rejected on
grounds of you know whether it was an
appropriate
what's the right name appropriate
whether the courts were the right
vehicle for the complaint
what's the word
standing yes standing
so the complaints did not meet the legal
legal standard
for standing meaning that it wasn't the
right people taking the right to
complain to the right court
is that is that close enough it wasn't
the right people taking the right kind
of complaint to the right court
so we never had a situation where the
right people took the right complaint to
the right court
although sometimes i think they did
but in general a lot of things were
rejected by standing
so matt gates tries to give that answer
how was that answer
true
so matt gates answers was accurate
and right on point
also a complete failure persuasion-wise
so being accurate
and being right on point and being
confident and all the things he did
right because he did a lot right not
even close to being good enough
here's what good enough would look like
you ready
put me in matt gates's chair jamie
raskin says you know scott adams that
no court and he lists the number of
courts and the number of claims and if
they've all been turned down he said
what do you what do you think about that
scott no court no court
here's the right answer
i'd like to understand your question
better uh mr eskin
there seems to be an embedded assumption
in your question i just need a
clarification
can i get a clarification on the
question are you suggesting
that the courts would be the right place
to evaluate the claims
and raskin would say something like um
um you know all these courts rejected it
they all rejected it he'd probably just
repeat himself he'd say yeah i know i
heard that part and and i agree with
everything you're saying but i'm looking
for your assumption
is your assumption that the courts were
the right vehicle
to evaluate claims because the court
said they weren't
you know all the ones you're mentioning
are you aware of that mr reskin
i just need a clarification you're aware
that the court said they're not the
right vehicle for this right
so i'm a little confused why you're
asking the question
were you not aware of that
right
[Laughter]
you could basically end raskin right
there
but you have to do it by asking him for
clarification
because you need to put him on his heels
here's what matt gates got wrong
he entered raskin's frame
he entered his frame
raskin painted a box
and then invited you know linguistically
he painted a box
and then invited matt gates to get into
his box which was a kill box
and matt gates walked right into the
kill box
well armed well armed because maggie's
is really really good at this stuff but
he walked into the kill box
don't walk into the kill box never
never don't enter his frame you gotta
break his frame
he he offered a frame
you say i need a clarification on that
because there's an assumption that
embedded in your question that
that i need to understand because
my assumption
wouldn't make your question make sense
but maybe you can explain it to the
public
why the courts didn't think they were
the right vehicle for this
but but you still do
is there something that you know
that all those judges don't know
jamie rescue i mean or jeremy
there were what 60 some judges
who all think that they were not
appropriate
vehicles for this question but you still
think they were
i better explain that
see where i'm going okay how many of you
think my answer would be better
you know you can be brutal
you can be brutal if you think it
doesn't
it's not even close right
now
let me ask you another question
except for the part
where i would never run for president
because you know i don't want them
looking into my life and tearing me
apart there would be a suicide mission
i could be president
because
there is a skill set
for this sort of stuff
that i possess
matt gates has that skill set
like really really good
but you know he got taken down by
by the media so far i don't know if
he'll
recover but
he doesn't have he doesn't have my level
you know i i would put matt gates as a
eight and a 10 on communication which is
higher than almost everybody
but i am a 10. i am a 10. there are 10s
i think trump's a 10.
trump's a 10.
absolutely
and i and let me be clear it's not
because of some genetic quality i
possess
i'm not saying i'm good at this because
i'm somehow born
born with talent
no it's it's a skill
it's literally just a skill you can
study
i've studied it
anybody who'd studied it as much as me
could do what i do
let me give you an example
uh the same problem you know uh let's
let's take mike cernovich by the way if
you don't know i use him for all my
examples
for some reason he fits every example
like story
i don't know why but there's something
something about the nature of him that
he fits lots of stories
if mike cernovich wanted to be president
again you'd have to subtract out
whatever you know things the press would
talk about in his past so neither he nor
i are really legitimate
possibilities for the president but does
he have the skill set
to do what i just told you matt gates
should have done
yeah it does
how much would you like to have seen
mike
cerdovich
answer jeremy raskin's question in
public
it would have been different
it would have been different yeah you
can you can uh
talk about all the reasons that he or i
are unqualified for other reasons but
communication wise
uh he's a ten
all right
supply chain
yeah trump would have fixed this by now
i i feel like there could have been a uh
a warp speed
version for trucking
i do think that the
the number one reason i get for the
supply chain problems
is that
there aren't enough trucks and truckers
you don't think trump would have already
spun up a warp speed for trucking
and how hard could it be
how hard could it be to do warp speed
and say uh well we got a problem here
but in three weeks you can have a
ton of trucks and truckers
there are definitely enough unemployed
people who want jobs you could
definitely temporarily give them you
know
emergency pay to make it worthwhile you
could definitely get people who would be
willing to be trained because
you know maybe the training is free
because right now i think you have to oh
correct me if i'm wrong
i need a fact check on this everybody i
need a fact check on this
trucker school
costs money
that people don't have in other words
there are a lot of people who want to be
truckers but they can't afford it
because the trucking school costs money
how do i know that
how does scott know that trucking school
costs money and the people who might
want to be truckers don't have that
money
the reason i know that is i once paid
for somebody to go to trucking school
do you know why i did
because there was no way in the world
that he ever could have gotten the money
together
that's right
so
i've actually paid
i don't know if he went i remember i
offered but um offered to pay for
somebody to go to driving school because
it wasn't a problem he could solve
couldn't figure out how to make money to
make money so i thought well i could get
you kickstarted
and i don't remember how much
in the few thousands does somebody have
a number for that
while we're here can somebody do a
little research and put it in the
comments
what does it cost to go to trucking
school
i see 3k i see 15 it wasn't 15 and i see
5k my memory was 5k
i'm seeing 5k more than anything else
how many truckers can spend how many
people who are unemployed or looking for
a new job could spend 5k
to get a job that might be temporary
and
doesn't sound too good in the first
place
how hard a problem is that to solve
not hard
it's one executive order
and it's one emergency funding
you know in the short term
no seriously let me let me back up and
ask the question
you don't think trump would have solved
this by now
i mean i'm not sure i quite understand
the problem which is also part of the
problem but if any part of it is that we
don't have enough
trained truckers
i'm pretty sure that would be solved by
now
just
pay them to go to school
and that would probably do it
just pay for the classes
now there is a secondary question of
enough trucks
uh california has some kind of
environmental rule that
um sort of mothballed a bunch of trucks
could any of those trucks be put back in
production temporarily
probably
you know maybe they have to steal parts
from one truck to build a good truck you
know one good truck out of three
but i feel like
these are all things you could do with
an executive order
and and a big wallet
so
you know there's no way to know that
trump would have done a better job on
this right but here's the things we do
know he would have probably fired
somebody's ass by now
right and the country would feel good
about that
because we kind of need to see somebody
get fired
like it's not like i have some kind of
bloodlust and i don't even have a bad
feeling about you know buddha judge i
think he has a lot of talents there's a
lot to offer i think
but i think he probably used to get
fired
if he was the one really who should have
been doing any of this or recommending
it or writing the eo for biden to sign
you know nobody's even writing an eo for
him to sign
uh do you know how uh
the trump
executive orders got written
different ways right but generally
people who understood things and needed
something and said all right well
we'll write you a first draft
obviously you know lawyers look at it
but we'll just write you the first draft
it needs to look like this
lawyers look at it president signs it
who's doing that for biden
who is giving biden executive orders
first drafts that says look you know
this this could be good if we put this
in good order you know get it lawyered
up
all right
i think we're going to see a hashtag
that says trump would have fixed this by
now
that's what i think
all right
that
looks to be what i wanted to talk about
today
why can't more women be truckers
i i don't know if there's any issue
with that is there
you know
i mean you can think of all the usual
reasons why they might not want to get
into the business
uh fake news truckers can be trained in
two weeks
i think that's true
um somebody said that truckers can be
trained in two weeks is fake news um
coming from me
what is what is the right amount of time
if anybody who's been trained or gone to
trucker school
what would be the amount of time to
train a trucker
i say two weeks
in an emergency two weeks
in an emergency two weeks
yeah
i'm saying three to four weeks is normal
so how many people would disagree with
me
six months three months
do you actually know what you're talking
about or just
i i think the most people are saying
four weeks and that feels right
i think it's a four-week course that in
an emergency you could do in two i think
they're probably a lot of people who you
know maybe have some experience and it
doesn't take them the four full four
weeks
convoy
convoy
i also wondered uh
let me just throw something out there
um
your housemate trained with ups a couple
of weeks ago yeah slightly different
problem
let me ask you this we've got all these
products at the ports i guess they're
unloading a lot of the products from the
shipping containers and putting them in
temporary warehouses until they can get
enough trucks
is there a play
where we could discount those goods
and just sell them at the port
i don't know i mean it's probably
impractical but i just wonder
let's just work through this
let's say you heard
that there were a whole bunch of
shipping containers with
i don't know televisions
a bunch of new 4k tvs
and there's a whole shipping container
and they just can't get it on a truck
and let's say that the company who
purchased them for whatever retail
purpose
says look can you let us sell it
we'll sell it right out of the container
if you let us sell it out of the
container
like we'll just stand there with a
credit card reader
you just take one out take one out of
the container i'll just put your credit
card in here you just put it on your
truck and take it home
give you a 30 discount
30 discount if you put it on your truck
and take it home
it would be a total bottleneck traffic
nightmare
probably
probably all right let me let me let me
open it up again
is there no way to get those containers
to some place where it wouldn't be a
bottleneck
such as putting a container on one
smaller ship yeah you probably can't do
that
i know i'm just just brainstorming
i'm sure people have thought of all
these things and rejected them for one
reason or another but i think we've got
to get creative
and i'm not sure anything's happening so
here's the pro here's my main problem
everything else is just speculation the
main problem
is that the biden administration
has no lead face
telling us what's happening every day
and we need somebody to tell us what's
happening every day now
and be right about it
use fedex and ups offices well
i don't know how that would work
the highways of the bottleneck no i
don't think they are well maybe just
around the ports that could be true
uh no trucks in california because no
independent contractors in california
yeah i've heard that issue there's
something about
you have to be an employee
to drive a truck in california because
they don't want independent contractors
to be cheating on their taxes or
whatever
again
how easy would that be to fix with an
executive order
right it's an emergency every one of
these problems don't apply in an
emergency you know i was saying that
during the pandemic when you know trump
was doing eos a lot of people would say
well you can't do that you can't do this
you can't do that and i kept saying the
same thing
in a crisis you can do anything
there are no rules in a crisis
except that it's a you know whatever
you're doing makes sense
the only rule that makes sense in a
crisis is is does this look like it'll
work
that's it
everything else doesn't matter you can
get rid of that stuff
yeah you have to be on war footing
exactly
uh yeah you
yeah you'd have to suspend osha you
probably have to suspend a whole bunch
of stuff but temporarily
it's all it's all doable temporarily it
looks like
all right
why is everybody talking to user eslax
apparently there's a troll over here
that people are taking seriously on
youtube
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow i know you can't wait you're
already looking forward to it come on
you know you are see you tomorrow
