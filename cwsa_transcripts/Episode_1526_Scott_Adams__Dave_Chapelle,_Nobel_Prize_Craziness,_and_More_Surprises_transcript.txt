hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
once again
as always what yes the best thing in the
universe the known universe
that i will allow
that there's a possibility that outside
the known universe there might be
something better than this but i kind of
doubt it frankly
you know
probably what you're thinking is how can
i take it up another notch because
that's the kind of people you are if you
watch coffee with scott adams you're not
satisfied with the status quo
no
no no you're much better than that you
know that continuous improvement is
where it's at and to continuously
improve this morning you're going to
have a simultaneous sip and it's going
to be marvelous
oh no i know some of you are still
holdouts yeah no i know that i see you
yeah i see you
i'm looking at you you're saying to
yourself there's no way in hell
he is going to cause me to sip at the
same time as him i will not fall
for that brainwashing and mind control
no
no
you won't
we'll see about that
and for the rest of you who have
discovered the unbridled joy of the
simultaneous sip the rest of you can sit
there in sadness and silence while we
have an amazing experience and all you
need is a couple of mugger glasses
tanker chelsea stein canteen junior
flash vessel of any kind tell me your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now all the amazing smart
and sexy people
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day thing that makes
everything better
go
i i saw somebody on youtube said that
all you have left in your cup is the
backwash
well if you think that's not good enough
you have not experienced the
simultaneous sip
yeah
it'll make the backwash
taste divine
well let's talk about all the news um i
retweeted a uh
a tick tock parody
in which there was a woman making fun of
the tick-tockers who danced goofy
and she was doing a science
thing saying you should have controlled
trials etc
the funny thing about it was
how many people couldn't tell it was a
parody
now her point was not a parody she was
trying to make a point about using
science instead of just
anecdote
fair enough
but it was an ordinary looking woman and
here this is not an insult right she
looked like the people you see in
ordinary life as opposed to
the tick tock instagram stars that look
a little too perfect
and she does an incredibly awkward dance
that is just close enough
to the people who actually do it on tick
tock that you're not entirely sure she's
joking which is what makes it brilliant
it's the funniest thing i've seen in a
month yeah i can't do the imitation but
she does the goofy dancing
i think i watched it 10 times anyway
it's in my twitter feed today if you
want to see that for a laugh and the
laugh is knowing that other people don't
know she's that she's just doing a
parody
they can't tell
remember i predicted a while ago
that reality and parody would merge and
we just wouldn't know the difference
they would just look the same this is
one of those examples
well because you have prodded me and
poked me and told me
damn it scott you've got to watch the
dave chappelle comedy special on netflix
the new one
and give us your opinion on did he
insult
the trans community or the lb
gtq community or anybody else
and so i watched it last night and i
have the following review
uh first of all on the
dimension of art
if we just judge it for its art
a plus
a plus just about one of the i don't
know
maybe the the second best stand-up i've
ever seen
the first was dave chappelle's last
special
i think this is about as good
it's brilliantly constructed
because unlike other comedians who get
up and tell a bunch of jokes
he builds a structure
he builds a whole structure and the
structure doesn't come together until
the end of the show
now watching that level of art
on top of really really funny stuff
and and the type of humor that he makes
me laugh at
i've never even seen
i've never even seen
if you watch most comedians who are even
name brand comedians you see the formula
you know what i mean you see the formula
in each joke you're like that's one of
those oh it's one of the jokes where he
says
what if people were like babies oh yeah
yeah because if people are big babies
and when they ask the food they'd cry
that's like 90 of all
comic acts
or the what if this was like this
but chappelle makes me laugh
as sentences that i can't even tell why
they're funny
somebody in the comments is a little bit
ahead of me norm mcdonald is the same
thing
well different
let's say in the same um
let's say general field they're not
they're not that similar
but nor mcdonald's act is about him
making you uncomfortable
and if you don't get that you don't get
his act this is norm mcdonnell
likewise
dave chappelle came right and told the
audience directly he was going to make
him uncomfortable
and that he was going to go farther
than they would feel comfortable
and then he did it
amazingly
like just the
the level of intelligence and art
he brings to his act is really
impressive it's really impressive it's
not like
i don't even think you can put him in
the same category
as other humorous really i mean he's
he's operating on two levels and who
else is doing that right now
it's kind of rare
so um then so on the artistic level a
plus
best in the game
everything about it was good including
the fact he said it was his last uh last
comedy special
for at least for a while
so
what do you do when you're going to do a
show that's going to get you canceled
and you know it
how do you handle that
well the way he did it was saying it was
his last special
which is kind of brilliant
it's also the third level
so the first level is jokes
the second level is that he's designing
a package that you don't fully see until
the end of the show
and then the third level is reality
he's playing three games at once
who the hell does that
i mean seriously who the hell does that
i mean george carlin you could argue but
i think carlin was really more about the
jokes although he was also playing with
the audience's response
but i think chappelle just takes it to a
whole new level now
did he
insult the lgbt community
don't know
how would i know
i mean i just watched it
i don't know how anybody else feels
about it i can't i can't feel what they
feel but did i see it no
no i didn't
i didn't see a trace of it
not a trace
and i don't want to give away the act
because there's a reason i say i didn't
see a trace of it
and that and the reveal of why i feel
that way
would be giving away too much so i'm not
going to tell you that
but do i think that the criticisms are
valid now no not even a little bit
not even a little bit not even a trace
not a whiff not a not a vapor not a
sniff
nothing
one
small small criticism
and it's really small
but i feel like it's worth noting
so
part of his defense and i don't think
this is giving way too much is that he
was a a good friend and supporter of a
specific
transgender
individual
and the story was compelling and i won't
tell you any more about it
but
it rang a little bit like
i've got a black friend so i'm not a
racist
anybody else get that
anybody else anybody else feel like
yeah i have this one friend
who is trans
felt a little bit like i've got one
black friend so i'm not a racist a
little bit
now
at the same time
that's a very unfair criticism
very unfair criticism
but so is the other one
so is the other one
it reminded me of that other criticism
but i think they're both unfair
because and i've said this a number of
times but
what is the right response to somebody
saying let's say a typical white person
talking to a typical black american
and says i can't be racist my best
friend is black or my good friend is
black
and then the black person says oh you
got that one that one black friend thing
weak
weak argument
it might be but here's here's the better
way to to treat it it's like oh that's
great
maybe you'll have you have two black
friends soon
that's the only way to treat that
right treating it as a criticism i think
is completely
the wrong direction because you're
you're you're basically talking people
out of the one good thing they did
if you did one good thing
you made friends with one black person
how about encouraging that hey that's
great i'm actually it's good to know you
have a
black friend
i hope he introduces you to some other
people and
we get something going here
so uh
i'll just tell you i was reminded of
that criticism but it's not a it's not a
fair criticism
so let me let me apply this to dave
chappelle
he had one
close trans friend
it's more than you have
okay not all of you not all of you i
know that but let's say 90 of you it's
more than you have
so
one is more than you have it's more than
i have
i don't have a trans friend
right i wouldn't have any objection to
it but i just don't have one
and
i feel like he should be
complimented for that even though it
makes me think of that other thing all
right southwest airlines
having a bunch of cancelled flights i
think they tried to
play that off as weather related
apparently it's not here and
it looked like the pilots were doing
some kind of a sick out or
taking their personal days or something
but here's a little bit more on that
story
a couple of facts that are relevant
number one
apparently a lot of the pilots have
personal days built up
and if you quit a job and you've got a
bunch of personal days you just lose
them
so it's a lot of the pilots are probably
thinking to themselves i might quit
because of the forced vaccination rule
that's that's the problem i might quit
so i better take all my personal days
now
so some of this is being accelerated
by people getting ahead of maybe
quitting by taking all the personal days
because you might as well get paid for
him
and
on top of that
i saw an estimate this is not an
official estimate just somebody who is
observing
believes that something like 80 percent
of pilots are ex-military
didn't see that coming did you
now i can confirm from
you know my wife's experience flying
that there are tremendous number of
ex-military people who are pilots
because they learn in the military it's
very expensive to learn to be a pilot
so learning as a private citizen is
almost prohibitive
especially if you have a job
but learning in the military is you know
required and so they've got that skill
and then they take it into the into the
civilian world so eighty percent of
pilots are ex-military
um some of them
are still fighting for the country
some of them
um
still patriots maybe all of them
but apparently this is a group of people
that doesn't like to get pushed around
sorry
turns out that the ex-military doesn't
like to get pushed around
who saw that coming
well
here's the problem
the problem is not the society
is sort of distributed evenly
across you know many industries
some areas of society have
concentrations of people
and this is one of them
they have a high concentration of people
who don't want to be pushed around
and they also control a vital resource
in the country
flying
and apparently enough of them have
decided
they're just going to not put up with it
and
i'm not going to say i agree with them
or disagree
so i'm not i'm not going to take their
position or
or talk against it
i i'm still very very much the view you
all have to make up your own decisions
about getting vaccinated or what you do
about it
but
um despite being neutral on their
um on their
decisions right i'm not neutral on my
own decisions but i'm neutral on your
decisions you make your own
despite being neutral about it
i am inspired by it
are you not inspired by this
that the the people
you know that join the military one way
or the other
um
looks like they got another mission
didn't ask for it
but there it is
um
so that's one place that there is a
large concentration of people who aren't
going to get pushed around
it's not the only one
there are some other groups of people
one of them i understand which i just
learned and i won't tell you my source
he's probably watching right now
um
it turns out that in the south
a lot of the major industries are
populated very to a large degree
by black people
one of them is like ship building
military shipbuilding
so the military shipbuilding business
just ground to a halt
because there aren't enough
vaccinated employees you have a large
black
workforce
so you're going to see some places where
people who don't want to get pushed
around for different reasons you know
they have their own reasons and i don't
agree or disagree but the black
population of this country what do they
have in common in this particular case
with the
pilots and ex-military people
these are two groups of people
you don't want to with
sorry
i slipped i didn't mean to use that
it's two groups of people
don't want to be pushed around
it just doesn't work you just can't push
them around right they're just not going
to take it
so i'm not saying that they're right or
wrong i'm just saying that they can't be
pushed and if there are concentrations
of people who can't be pushed and they
have control over vital
resources in this country
don't believe the government's in charge
never has been not in this country the
government's in charge when it's
convenient to you
the government's in charge
when most of us agree with what they're
doing
the government's in charge when it's
about collecting the garbage and you
didn't want to do it yourself
the government's in charge when the
country gets attacked
because we like it that way we want a
good
you know integrated
centralized defense
do you know when the government isn't in
charge
when you don't need them to be and you
don't want to be and most of the public
is fed up
as soon as the public wants this stuff
to end
it's over
and
it might be led by groups that just
don't like to get pushed around
and good for them
we need them right
even when they're wrong we need them
because you need you need citizens who
won't take it just won't put up with it
so maybe good news coming but we might
have to go through some
some deprivation for a while
mandates are probably going to make life
kind of tough on the economy for a
little while
it's okay with me i call that legitimate
protest
totally legitimate whether i agree with
them or not and i by the way i'm
anti-mandate so i guess i do agree with
them
but uh
at the same time i did get vaccinated so
um
i asked this question on twitter
i asked people what they learned during
the pandemic meaning what kind of skill
they acquired you know and you need to
look at the answers
talk about
motivating or
really almost exhilarating
there are two kinds of people and i
don't know to what extent
people can
turn into the other kind
but
have you noticed the whole country got
fat
anybody notice that
um
yeah
the the the weight gain of the whole
country is outrageous
now
what would be the best response
for a country that has a deadly virus
that targets primarily overweight people
you know older and overweight those are
the the two big risks what would the
country do to respond to such a threat
well this country got fatter
the the country got fatter by a lot
right on average i know a lot of you
didn't
so i asked this question of people who
follow me um you know what
what benefits did you get tons of people
who follow me lost weight
i'll bet if you looked at the average
person who follows
my content
especially because i talk about exactly
this sort of stuff
and i was telling you early in the
pandemic my god you're never going to
get a chance like this again
in all likelihood
this will be the time you can reboot
this is the time you can figure out how
to get your fitness under control this
is the time to diet
this is the time to start a new
business this is the time to learn a
language uh acquire some skills
and i've been saying that with you for
people who follow me since the beginning
and then i've been tracking it
and of course my book had failed almost
everything and still win big is about
building what i call a talent stack
and
you need to read the comments
look what happened
to the people who took that point of
view
versus the people who probably just took
some kind of pessimistic ah
yeah i might as well eat
and you'll see in the comments too you
see a lot of people are already
commenting of the things they learned
and the weight they lost and stuff like
that
i also got in great shape
so i'm in great shape i think i
i probably acquired
five to seven skills
that are directly related to my job
um
yeah so i would i would argue that there
are two kinds of people in the world and
we just discovered who they are
the people who took advantage of the
crisis and the people who just treated
it like a crisis
and and lost
so
um
there we go somebody says they expanded
their business partly thanks to me
a number of people have been thanking me
this morning for
for exactly that for the inspiration to
start a business or to lose weight or
something
and
it makes me feel good
you know i feel like i did something
useful
you know the meaning of life
if you're looking for the meaning of
life
it's almost always
what you did for other people
and when i hear people say oh there was
something you said or something in your
book that
caused me to succeed in some way and i
literally hear that every day
uh it really makes me feel good
it's it's the largest reason i do this
is that i get that feedback and it gives
me meaning
i mean it would be really easy you know
it it would be real easy for me to just
stop working
just lay at the beach
go lay on the beach all day
but
why
it seems like a terrible thing to do
sounds like an awful life
like the the part that is meaning to me
is people saying oh
you helped me in some way
um
there was a study i think it was in
february and it was a while ago but i
didn't see it uh it said basically the
super spreaders are older obese people
by a lot right so it's not like they're
ten percent worse they're like you know
four or five times worse
in terms of spreading if you're both
large
and older
now
i think you heard that from me before
you heard it from science am i right
how can somebody give me a
confirmation on that
i think i was telling you there's no way
that a five-foot
woman
is putting out as much coved as a
300-pound man
there's just no way that that could be
true and sure enough is exactly what you
think
the bigger the person
and the older they are which they tend
to get sicker and then have more virus
to expel
those two things are telling you most of
what you need to know to stay away from
i will tell you that there was a time
recently that i entered a smallish
indoor space
and there was a large older man there
and i got out of there right away
i immediately left
because i'm not going to spend any time
in a small enclosed space
with a large older person
this is not going to happen because
if i take that out of my life which is
pretty easy right there's not not many
situations where you'd have to be there
if i take that one risk out of my life
i've reduced my risk of catching it by
what like
500 or something
some gigantic number
if the only people i hang around with
are people who are not large
really large
uh
elderly people are probably fine
you know it doesn't remove all your risk
but i mean a lot of it
uh on twitter david ria boy
i hope i'm pronouncing right me it's
either reboy or ria boy
um he had this tweet that really hit me
in the
like hit me in the center of my
existence
you said 90 95 of women you meet can't
wait to travel somewhere with you alone
with friends etc
do they really enjoy it or is it
something they think they should enjoy
now
i can't tell you how many times this
question has been on my mind
now i'm i'm sort of the
stay home and and build a
exciting life where i'm already at you
know i've designed my house to have all
the toys i need and
the people in it or the people i wanted
to be in it and
uh i do this so i have this amazingly
your deep kind of meaningful life
without leaving this chair
i mean i do more in this chair
literally this chair
than you know people can do in years in
terms of stimulation and interesting
things to do so i don't need travel
like other people do now i don't know
what other factors are but i was looking
at this speculation people had
about and first of all do you agree with
that
do you agree that women seem to be
obsessed with travel in a way that men
are not even if you like travel
women have like gotta travel it's almost
like they have to
so yeah i'm seeing confirmation of that
so a lot of people saying the same i
thought it was just me
i thought that there was some weird
coincidence in my life
that whenever i met
a female
the only thing that could make them
happy is travel let me say it again
it's the only thing that can make them
happy and they'll tell you that
in exactly those words only one thing
can make me happy
lots of travel
have you heard that
on who's dying exactly
so i mean it's easier to travel if
somebody else is paying for it
all right um so here are the reasons
that and i don't understand why exactly
but here are the speculations mostly for
men all right so here here are
sexist
opinions
so these are men
speculating i think they're mostly men i
might be wrong about that i think
they're mostly men
speculating about women
why women like to travel are you ready
for some super sexist
opinion here
alright one is
somebody said that women like to travel
because quote
it costs a lot of money
in the comments i want to see
if you agree or disagree now there's not
one reason right it's going to be a
variety of reasons but does but does
that one fit into any of your model
that women like to travel
because it costs a lot of money
see mostly no's
knows
nobody nobody wants to go with that one
see i see one yes a few yeses all right
let me put a little more meat on that
all right
somebody else use this phrase it's
signaling on social media
there's a way to signal
some kind of success or freedom or
something
now you're saying yes to that one right
is
is the social signaling
different
from what the first person said it costs
a lot of money
of related aren't they because i got
mostly used to say yes
that it's about signaling your success
or something on social media but yet you
weren't willing to say
that they do it because it costs a lot
of money
what is it about these vacations
that they show on social media makes
them worth showing on social media is it
because the pictures are attractive
that's part of it
it's because it costs a lot of money
right
i think it's signaling
resources
or signaling that somebody in their life
was willing to spend a lot of money to
take them somewhere
so definitely the fact that it's
exclusive and expensive
got to be part of it
right
um
another theory is that uh i don't i
don't remember if this was a man or a
woman who said this but that the home is
where the women do their work
sexist
statistically there's something to it
but sexist right no reason it's the
woman who's staying home in many cases
it's the other way
so
um
but what do you think but statistically
probably more women are staying home
than men still
so do you think that's it the home is
where the women do their work so they
just got to get out of the office
basically and the only way you can do
that is go on vacation
seeing some yeses
i say yeses
saying correct
i prefer the kitchen true yes
okay
but let me give you the counter argument
let's say it's a what you call the the
classic 50s family
where the man is working all day and
the mom is being a mom
and i know i know that doesn't describe
the world anymore but let's just take
that for our example to talk it through
so the man works all day
you know gets up at five or whatever
travels works all day at least in the
old world maybe he's working at home now
gets home after work
and then the man luckily
doesn't have to do any more work
so luckily when the man is at home
no work
what
what
why are you arguing with me in the
comments
that's the way it works isn't it
doesn't the man work all day
and then when he comes home
no more work it's vacation time
good times
no
no not in the real world in the real
world the man works all day and then
comes home and starts working again he
just works
at home
like it's his turn to watch the kids
it's
his turn to drive et cetera
um
now
of course there are other cases i'm
seeing in the comments somebody's saying
your husband works and she does
everything else
i can see that
are you saying that when your husband
comes home after work
you don't ask him to do anything
so if something's broken
you get out the tools and you fix it and
your husband's on the couch
is that working at your house
all right and then the other thing is a
change of scenery but i would think that
men would need to change the scenery
as much as women but i don't know
um i will tell you that my pet peeve is
the two-stop
trip
the two-stop trip
as a man let me tell you the women and i
want to see if any men agree with me
because for the women this might be the
first time you hear this
two percent of acts in africa all right
lots of times there'll be a like a
social trip so it could be something
local where you're going to a friend's
house and then you'll have this this
evening planned oh we're all going to go
to this restaurant
or we're going to go to this friend's
house
somebody
who's part of the plan will always say
oh yeah
but before that
why don't you come over here for some
drinks at my house or maybe after that
why don't we go to this other place you
know a club or a bar or something
i hate
the two-stop night
one stop
one destination
one thing
i can enjoy that completely
but no
do not try to organize people to go to
two places
everything falls apart if you go to the
appetizer house first
then you you drink alcohol and you have
to drive
bad enough
you know to a second place and then
you're full because they serve the
appetizers and you feel like you have to
eat them i mean it ruins the whole night
and on vacation
oh my god
i hate the traveling part
most of you would agree the traveling
part where you're actually moving to the
new place is
hell for me
it's just hell
and it's common for whoever i'm with at
the moment christina will plan a trip
and it'll be like hey let's go to let's
say different country
and i'll be like grudgingly because i
never
love to travel but i can get talked into
it and then enjoy it so i enjoy it after
i go it's just hard to talk me into it
somewhere in that plan almost every time
they'll be oh
and we'll take two days to you know
visit this other country out of our week
a whole vacation is ruined for me
you had that second trip
the whole thing's ruined
anybody
anybody else is there anybody else who
agreed with my statement that adding a
second trip
to anything
ruins the whole experience
yeah i'm seeing some no's but lots of
yeses
so women any women watching this
if you're adding that second place
somebody in your car
isn't happy with you but may not tell
you
just know it
all right here's the question uh should
we all have the same stuff and the same
access to things or the same amount of
happiness which is fair
that we have the same amount of stuff
and the same amount of access and rights
and stuff or the same amount of
happiness
which should we manage to
i'm seeing somebody say access
we should we manage to that because we
can
all right how about um forget access
because yeah you're right you have to
manage access but how about
success
should we manage to get everybody the
same amount of success and money
or the same amount of happiness
the goal of life is happiness right
right
if you did a poll and found out that
everybody was about the same amount of
happiness you're done are you
and i think if you did a poll you'd find
now people are about the same amount of
happiness
i'm not sure
but i think that would be the case
people don't real roughly the same
so why are we trying to fix everything
there's nothing to fix everybody's just
about as happy as they're gonna get and
if you gave people more stuff it
wouldn't make them happier i mean you
know beyond the the minimum
you know once you get the minimum but
you got to get the minimum i think
that's worth doing
all right uh
i heard somebody say that uh either
we're gonna have more uh
fake
vaccine
identification cards because people will
try to beat the system
but
it can't be long before facial
recognition is how you check your
vaccine status right
correct me if i'm wrong
is there not a database or databases
somewhere in government control
in which they have your name and your
social security number and
when you got vaccinated and by what
am i wrong that that exists
isn't everybody who gives vaccinations
required to report it
somebody says no social serious number
really
but they do have identification because
you have to show id
all right so
here's the thought
i believe that there will be uh
facial recognition apps
that can just grab your face and
immediately see if you're vaccinated
and if not you know we could have that
easily so i don't think the the problem
of
fake vaccination cards is going to last
forever even fake ids is going to go
away i would imagine that it won't be
long before
um
you know let's say a club doesn't have
to ask for your id they'll just look at
your face and they'll know your age from
from other databases
um
anyway that's coming i'm not saying it's
good or bad it's just coming
so the nobel prize in
economics has been awarded
oh stop it
stop it
let me say it again and
don't say what you just said again okay
so the nobel prize in economics has been
awarded no stop it
i know what you're saying
um some of you are saying there's no
such thing as the
nobel prize in economics
you pedantic
mofos
what you're saying is that really what i
mean is the
severe regis ricks bank prize in
economic sciences in memory of alfred
nobel
that's what it is
it's not the nobel prize you fool
you fool
calling it a nobel prize in economics
so dumb
when it's really this vegas is rick's
bank prize in economic sciences in
memory of alfred nobel
sometimes informally called the nobel
memorial prize in economic sciences
because you have to have that memorial
part in there because there might be
some people
who still think alfred nobel is alive
so you gotta you know let him know he's
gone so you throw in the memorial part
all right so this is what they won the
uh nobel prize
for in economics i'm still gonna call it
that
they won that for saying that you need a
control group
to study something
what
what
let me give you the example
apparently before the 90s it was common
to
study things by saying okay let's say
new york city just put in a new
you know broken windows or stop and
frisk policy whatever it is and the
objective is to lower crime
and so they put in the policy and then
they measure the amount of crime
from the time the policy went in until
they're measuring
and these two economists said wait a
minute
you can't just measure the change
because there might be a whole bunch of
other things happening such as maybe
crime is just going down everywhere
right
so they said the only way to do this
is to compare a like place that didn't
do what you're doing so you'd have two
similar places let's say a county here
and a county here and the counties are
very similar in the important ways
one of them does a change
one of them does not
and then you see how the difference is
later so one acts as a control group
for the one that makes the change
now here's the thing
people didn't know that in 1990
what
and
apparently they didn't
apparently they didn't it was very
common
to simply measure that something changed
and call it a day
even though that's a complex system with
all kinds of things changing and crime
was falling everywhere no matter what
you were doing
it was completely useless analysis
that was popularly being done
now i didn't i'm not aware of any time
we didn't know to do that are you
now i have a degree in economics so
maybe i was you know closer to the
question
but i don't remember any time in my life
that i thought i didn't need a control
group
[Laughter]
they got a nobel prize for that
for duh
well
not only did they get a nobel prize for
duh
it's worse than that
they weren't even right
i should have gotten this nobel prize
let me just put that out there this
nobel prize should have gone to me
because
i have improved on their
line of thinking
and uh their line of thinking is
completely obsolete
and here is how i should get the nobel
prize and it goes like this
you can't compare two complex systems
you can't
you can't complain you can't compare
one county to another
do you know why
because you have no idea what else is
different
you're guessing
you're guessing that the things that you
can see
are the ones that matter oh wait
same same number of democrats to
republicans in these two places i guess
we're done
looks about the same
no
what have i been telling you since the
pandemic began
i told you that every comparison of a
country
to another country
would be wrong
no matter how closely you thought the
two countries were similar in lots of
other ways
that every comparison of a country to a
country
would be misleading
because there's too much different and
you'll never know what
so let's say you're this rational
economist and you decide to study
let's say what sweden did
so you say to yourself well i need
whatever is the closest to a sweden
let's say just for a kicks you pick
norway
now forget about whether they're really
similar right
is just an example so you pick norway
you say okay on the things that seem to
matter
norway and sweden look similar so we'll
just check the thing that changed
and then we'll know something
do you see what's wrong with that
how do you know you found all the things
that mattered
how could you possibly know that
that's completely irrational
it is completely irrational 100
irrational
to say that norway
is enough the same
because the few things that you looked
at in norway and the few things that you
looked at in sweden they do look about
the same
you don't know what else is going on you
couldn't know
and there's no way to know that what
else is going on is meaningful or not
meaningful
it is completely unknowable
that is why i told you that no
comparison of country to country will
ever turn out to be a good idea in the
long run like we'll figure out that it
didn't work
have i been right so far
have i
have i been right so far
that every comparison of one country to
another
only raised more questions
and didn't answer anything
am i right
yes i'm freaking right
and it will never be useful because
complex systems can't be compared you
are only guessing
that you have controlled the variables
and guessing is the opposite of
science
now will you give me that one
will give me that f word
anybody
that i think that was an appropriate use
of the f word right there
not too much
kind of came as a surprise
nice seasoning
i think that was appropriate use so
and by the way i'm not kidding a bit
i'm not kidding a bit
that the nobel prize should have gone to
me
because my research which is just
watching the news
is superior
to their entire nobel prize winning work
what else have i done to earn the nobel
prize oh plenty plenty do you know that
i created the
the word confuse opely how many people
know that
it's you can google it it's on wikipedia
now and it's a it's a standard economic
um
go-to phrase
i actually created
a economic theory that's part of the
literature now
now the confusopoly idea goes like this
in the old days we used to say that if
two industries were competing and they
had similar products that they would end
up having to compete on price
and that eventually since the only thing
they could compete on was price
otherwise the product is the same
that it would drive the profit down to
nothing
and eventually those companies would go
out of business because they couldn't
make profits
everybody else would compete with them
with the same products
did that happen
no
so the most
basic economic belief
doesn't happen
and the explanation for that is
the confusably
my economic theory
which is that every industry that knows
it would go out of business if it
competed on price makes their product
intentionally confusing
so that you can't compare them
take insurance
can you compare to insurance policies no
it's too hard can you really tell if you
got the right cell phone plan
not so much no
so look for this all over the place
wherever yeah mattresses everything
where wherever there are products they
should be competing purely on price
the company has has complicated them
unnecessarily to you point you can't
tell
that you can't tell if one is better
than the other
right
i would say that's a valuable
contribution to the field because it
predicts
it predicts
what will happen with the industry and
it predicts it right every time
if your theory predicts
it's a good one
that seems like a pretty good one to me
i have also added the
adam's law of slow-moving disasters
somewhat economic in nature meaning that
if we have enough time we basically fix
every problem
i think that's a valuable contribution
because
it predicts
right if you can do an economic
idea that predicts
you've beaten just about everybody in
economics because you know what
economics doesn't do very well predict
it doesn't do that very well i mean i
guess the basic stuff but it can't tell
you where the economy is going to be
next year
how about my entire dilbert body of work
in which i've completely decimated the
management consulting industry and
effectively eliminated them by mocking
them out of existence
i feel like that was a valuable economic
contribution
how about the idea that i developed on
talent stacks
the idea that you can get the best
economic gain
by combining
non-special traits in a in a useful way
not trains but skills
so that was new
how much of how many of your lives were
changed by just hearing the talent stack
idea or the system's over goals
those are economic theories
um
and quite honestly if you tell me i
haven't contributed more to economics
than the guys who just won the nobel
prize in economics
i don't believe you
literally like that's not even a joke i
think i've actually contributed more now
i don't think i really deserve a nobel
prize right because they need to do the
math and do the papers and
do the other stuff and i haven't done
any of that but um
but i have contributed more than most of
the winners
remember i mentioned the idea of uh
special economic zones for immigrants
and i i said hey why don't we have a
place where the immigrants can come in
and they would just maybe work for less
than minimum wage but it's a special
zone
you know but they would be treated
nicely they wouldn't be treated as
slaves and they'd have maybe some path
to something
you know don't give them the same
rules as the rest of the country but
give them some opportunity
and a lot of you said no bad idea a bad
idea
turns out they exist
they exist
there are other places in the world
where this exact idea is being used
successfully
there will be more on this coming up
okay there's going to be a lot more on
this topic which i've been introduced to
i got a preview
so there's more on this topic it could
be a big big deal it might turn out that
there's a solution to immigration
that doesn't involve closing the border
and makes everybody happier
how cool is that
now yeah you can turn everything into a
work camp and you can turn it into
ghettos and uyghurs but obviously
there's a good way to do things in a bad
way all right
there's a good way and there's a bad way
don't assume it's a bad way well
breaking news merck
is asking for fda emergency use for
their pill for covin
so if you've got mild to moderate
symptoms you pop one of these pills a
mul
molo new pirover
and it stops the virus from
making copies of itself
now apparently it reduces your risk of
a serious event by half
that's pretty good
to which i ask this question
how many times have we reduced the risk
by half
and how many times do we have to reduce
the risk by half
before there's not enough risk
to change society the way it's been
changed
like
aren't we there
because it seems to me that adding the
monoclonals
you know
dropped the risk of dying
taking people off of ventilators dropped
the risk and you know knowing how to do
that ventilation thing better
um
whoops
um
so anyway
i'm just putting that out there how many
times we have to drop it all right
here's my idea that i tweeted out
i built a
fake news identifier
this is just a
spreadsheet
and i tweeted the link just before i got
on here and here's what it is just a
spreadsheet has a bunch of questions and
you just answer them here i've put in
this column and i'll tell you what the
questions are in a moment in this column
i put my weights this is me personally
saying how much you should weight each
of these factors that's my opinion based
on based on living
other people could put their filter here
so for example you might say oh i
identify fake news differently here's
the question i ask or here's the weight
i would put on on this so you might have
other people's filters too
but you would be able to use my filter
by weights that i put on things and my
questions
to decide if something is fake news so
so let me read the questions and then
for your specific project you would say
okay that one doesn't apply doesn't
apply oh but that one does
and let me i know you can't see it so
here's the first question is the source
anonymous now
my weights are on a one to ten i give
that a nine
if your source is anonymous that's a
nine and a 10 for likely fake news
is the source a disgruntled current or x
employee i'd give that a 5.
sometimes the ex-employees are right
sometimes they're just disgruntled i
give it a 5.
there's only one of either cnn or fox
news confirming that it's true
that's a nine if only one of them says
it's even true
that's a nine
um is it two on the nose to be perfect
you know the story is just too close to
the narrative it's exactly what
republicans expect
or exactly what the democrats expect
probably not
so i gave that one a seven
is it still in the fog of war phase in
other words do you know things are going
to be changing i give that an eight
is it is it two man bites dog meaning
that the story itself is too
unbelievable
like wow could that happen that's so
surprising
if you hear a story like that it's
probably not true
that's like an eight is it only covered
by secondary news sources i didn't
define that but i would i would call
that anything that's not a a national
platform you know one of the blog like
news sites that often get tweeted
uh if they're the only ones covering it
and it hasn't made it to you know new
york times washington post new cnn
probably not true probably not true
and does the journals have a grudge
against the subject i give that a five
because sometimes the grudge is a
reasonable grudge they have a grudge for
a good reason
so
this is not complete it's a first draft
it's simply a way
for people who are not as let's say
experienced
in determining fake news it's a way for
them to
at least get close to it now this is on
a link to a google sheets so i think you
can all see it
i haven't used google sheets before
so
i don't know if that uh is a step in the
right direction but i put it out there
just to you know deepen the conversation
i have to run right now so i can't stay
around even for locals but thank you for
coming i think you'll agree it's the
very best thing you've ever seen
the only one of cnn falco would claim
hundred button laptop stop stories false
no cnn more more just doesn't cover it
that's different
cnn did not say the laptop is fake as of
now
i mean originally they did that was the
fog of war
but at the moment they both they both
say it's true
all right bye for now
