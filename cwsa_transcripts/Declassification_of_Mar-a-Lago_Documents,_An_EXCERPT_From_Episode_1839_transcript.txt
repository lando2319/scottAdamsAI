this declassification center i believe i
have the best question on this topic
and i've not seen it addressed
and the best question on the topic of
declassifying the mar-a-lago
documents
is can a president declassify things by
his actions
meaning it's obvious that he meant it to
be declassified
and i think the answer is yes
now i'm not the constitutional expert
but um this is what i read today that i
didn't realize that both the george w
bush and obama had both signed executive
orders which are still in force
and they and it gave the presidents
whoever the president is sweeping
authority to declassify secrets
and here's the important part
do not have to follow the mandatory
classification
declassification procedures
that all other government officials do
and i'm sorry i took this off a website
i meant to give it credit
if somebody knows where i took that from
you probably read it too
could you give credit to wherever this
came from
i think there was a good addition to the
conversation but it was on a
right-leaning website somewhere
anyway
um
in my opinion
if a president who has full sweeping
authority to declassify
says
take these boxes and put them in my
residence
he's declassified them
who disagrees with me
if the president who doesn't have to
follow any procedure
says take these top secret things and
move them to this non-top secret
facility
they're declassified
now
you could say you don't like that
you can say you don't like it but how in
the world are you going to get a court
of 12 people to think that's not the
case
do you think you can get 12 jurors
who are going to say oh no that's that's
not declassification
yes the president can declassify any way
he wants
he doesn't have to use any specific
words
doesn't have to
write anything down doesn't have to do a
document doesn't need to tell anybody
doesn't need to tell anybody
doesn't need to tell anybody
there are no requirements on the
president
that's it so if you put me on the jury
i'm just going to say
i don't know
i mean you can't prove that he didn't
declassify him and by his actions it
sure looks like he did
and i would say that's that's the end of
that case
if you can't even know if they're if
they're classified or not why are we
even talking about it
now keep in mind when we talk about it
in the news you know we're just people
talking about it
we can act like
you know we have some certainty that we
don't have oh definitely declassified or
oh definitely wasn't but what if you're
a jury
the jury would have to be you know
beyond a reasonable doubt
certain that these had not been
declassified
how in the world would any jury be sure
of that if the
if the attorney says you know he didn't
need to follow any rules and by his
actions it's obvious he meant them to be
declassified
would you agree that if somebody takes
something out of a top secret place and
intentionally puts it in a low security
place
that they have changed the
you know the de facto decl
classification
you don't need to get all 12 to agree to
that but there's no way you don't get
nine of them to agree
am i wrong
how in the world
do you not get at least some of those 12
to say you know
that is enough of a gray area that i'm
not going to convict somebody on that
um
let's say i'm looking at this comment uh
or sets
anywhere about document if he writes it
anywhere about or sets of documents they
become immediately declassified
yeah
so i don't know if he said something
that would also qualify but maybe he did
i mean
suppose trump is sad and this is not in
evidence but suppose he had said to the
gsa people who were packing up the boxes
suppose they said hey this is top secret
stuff
you know we have to handle it
differently and suppose trump just said
oh no just
put it in the boxes and send it to
mar-a-lago
that's declassification right in my
opinion it would be
so i think he's gonna be fine on that
i don't think there's any any legal risk
at all on that
