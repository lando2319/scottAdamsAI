of
that four books in the 2025 dilbur
calendar which is only available by the
way on at the link at dil.com
I guarantee that at least one of those
books or one of those calendars will
make your gift receiving person
delighted good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams I'm pretty sure you've never
had a better time but if you'd like to
take this experience this Saturday
weekend experience of the Golden Age up
to levels that nobody can even
understand with their tiny shiny human
brain all you need for that is a copper
micro glass a tanker chelin a canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine h of the day
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens
now oh are you ready for a big dose of
golden age
things looking so good you can't even
believe
it well he came to the right
place cuz we got news oh we got news so
according to neoscope whatever that is
doctors have uh figured out how to make
dead brains show signs of
Life uh so far they've only done it in a
pig and they sha some juice into the pig
uh the dead Pig's brain
and it showed signs of possible
life and it was just a ad a pig's dead
head now they don't have a name for this
chemical yet but the working name is
Biden juice Biden
juice because it's what you shoot into a
dead brain to make it appear that it's
alive but maybe not yeah biteen
juice all right did you know that
marijuana use is associated with uh
enough pain reduction that uh sometimes
it can replace opioid
prescriptions you could have learned
this from Anthony Martinelli who wrote
about it in the marijuana Herald or what
would be another way let me think let me
think what would be another way you
could have learned that marijuana
reduces pain and in some cases can make
it unnecessary to have heavier pain
medications
who who could you have asked who that's
right me could saves the
money yep marijuana will help you with
your pain and suffering it won't replace
everything but for the lower end stuff
might do the
trick how many of you remember a few
years ago or a year ago I'm losing I'm
losing all my uh sense of things by the
way let me put the locals comments up
here special so I can not miss a thing
that they say they are so
clever there we
go there we go I can see you plainly
now so uh do you remember I'm trying to
think of the
timing and I also don't know if I have a
false memory so I need you to
me did I once recommend that AI be used
to decipher the omnus bills so that the
public can tell what's actually in the
law that's being
considered did I once did I want suggest
that and then I remember there was this
one point Elon mus said that grock would
be able to do that do you remember
that well apparently Gro can now do that
I don't know when it got that ability
but it's only being confirmed now so uh
somebody somebody mentioned just
recently hey would it be good if grock
could summarize the omnius bills and uh
musk responded grock can already do
this but wait it gets
better this part is really good if
you're not loving the Golden Age by the
time I'm done today you're dead on the
inside
because we got some good stuff today
some like seriously good stuff you ready
for this according to Elon grock 3 which
I guess is coming up soon we are adding
all court cases to the training set it
will render extremely compelling legal
verdicts that's the end of
lawfare I don't know but he might have
ended lawfare
because if I take the president Trump
situations and put them into his highly
capable Gro that has trained on all
training sets and then I ask it the
following
question do you think somebody else
would have been would have been charged
with
this what's it going to
say Elon Musk may have and I'm GNA say
accidentally because I don't know there
was any intentionality here he may have
developed a solution to
lawfare because we humans can argue
about it
forever but if we learn to trust the AI
when the AI says this should have been
innocent or it should have been guilty
what are we going to do when Gro says it
should have been one way and the and the
the jury says it should have been the
other oh this is good stuff so we might
have an ability to understand what our
uh our Congress is doing thanks to grock
and we might also be able to sort out
what's law fair and what is just you
know nobody's nobody's more important
than the
law it could be I mean I'm getting ahead
of myself because in the real world
anything can not work even if you think
it's a good
idea but I can't think of two better
ideas can you can you think of any
better two ideas that we need other than
understanding what we're really voting
for
my
God and and
secondly understanding if the court
cases are politically oriented or or if
it makes sense based on our
history so that's good
news um according to Peter diam
diamandis diamandis MD he thinks we have
less than 5 years before it will be
considered
malpractice for a doctor to diagnose you
with using
AI now do you remember what I always
tell you is one of the best ways to
predict the
future are you thinking of it right now
one of the best ways to predict the
future in the in the realm of the
commercial
World
insurance
insurance imagine if you will five years
from now that we've we've determined
with absolute certainty that the AI is a
big big help in diagnosing things in
five years we will certainly say that
with complete confidence now imagine you
go to the doctor and you get some
Imaging of some kind and your doctor
doesn't show it to the AI for a second
opinion it could but it just doesn't the
doctor could and then it turns out that
things don't go well but the AI would
have given the better diagnosis and
somebody dies what's the insurance
company going to do the insurance compan
is going to put that doctor on a
business and the doctor is going to say
well for you know for five extra minutes
of getting the AI to get a second
opinion I'm not going to take a chance
of losing my insurance and therefore
being on a
business so talk about a prediction that
you can
guarantee this is not a prediction this
is guaranteed because if you understand
the nature of the insurance
Market once you know for sure this
something makes something safer it's
like there's no doubt about it you don't
have an option of using it there's no
option you're going to have to use it
because if you make a mistake without it
you're definitely going to get sued and
you should be and you should be now I
responded to uh this on X by saying that
uh I already think that AI is my primary
doctor and I mean that
seriously because there are kind of two
categories of things there's little
things such as the other day I had a
pretty bad uh abrasion on my arm I just
was doing a home project and dropped
something on it just RI my ripped my arm
up and it started to look like it was
maybe a little
infected and so I thought hm I should
contact my doctor because I can email my
doctor and say does this look infected
and you know should I do something about
this but instead I thought why don't I
just ask perplexity so I go to
perplexity and I say hey you know how
should I treat a a thing that might be
getting infected and it says oh just get
some anti- disinfectant spray on it um
you'll be fine so I got some antibiotics
sprayed it on there slapped a big old
Band-Aid on there Hey look it's
fine it's all
healed now the so for little problems
you're the kind that you could bother
your doctor but but you don't even feel
good about bothering your doctor because
it doesn't seem like big a big enough
deal AI all all day long I'll use AI all
day long now there's another category
what if it's really complicated like
what if you get one of the big things
you know what one of the big problems
well do you think your doctor is as up
to date as AI
is probably not
you know you you might get lucky and
find a doctor who's like really doing a
deep dive recently on a specific problem
that you happen to have which should be
kind of Lucky but even if you're talking
to a professional who's a um a
specialist even the specialist doesn't
have time to look into every study and
look at every new article that comes out
nobody has that kind of time but AI does
so if you don't use AI at the same time
as you're using your doctor
if only to have a way to talk to
them if only to ask the right
question if only so you double check it
so you feel like maybe I don't need a
second opinion because it looks like
this is kind of common common
stuff so I would disagree with the
diamandis a little bit in saying that
Common Sense already requires it for
most things the the place where your
regular do is still your your better
your better move is if it's something
physical has to be touched you know or
poked or something like that you know a
whole B there probably half a dozen
other ways but at the very least you
should get a second opinion does anybody
disagree with that does any does anyone
disagree with the second opinion I think
we're already there right that you
wouldn't necessarily take the AI over a
human doctor I don't recommend that but
you should certainly take what the AI
said
and bring it to your human doctor and
say how about this I recommend it all
right watch the insurance industry it
drives
everything now I can't get over this
coincidence you know I always think
we're living in the simulation and the
evidence for it is just through the roof
at this point in my opinion the evidence
that we are part of a simulation is just
overwhelming now I know you're not
convinced and I won't try to convince
you uh I'm just saying my own experience
of it is it's kind of overwhelming I'll
give you another example so for the
first time in human
history it looks like most of the most
developed countries in the entire world
are having a serious population
decline that could destroy
Civilization now of course there are you
know places in Africa for example where
the you maybe the population is growing
fine but most of the industrialized
countries with the big weapons and the
big
economies um are really going to head in
One Direction and we know it I mean
there's some thinking that if we didn't
have immigration in America I saw
somebody's estimate that we would be
down by
32% not very long like one
generation if America loses 32% of its
population in one
generation I don't think we're going to
be a
superpower that doesn't sound too
healthy but at least it won't last long
but here's my
coincidence so how how long have there
been
humans about 300,000 years human
civilization what what's the uh what's
the official length of time the humans
have been on earth a million years or is
it like more like the Civilized part is
maybe 300,000 something like that but in
all that time is it true that there's
only been one time a very very narrow
little wedge of time in which we were
failing to make enough extra humans for
in the whole world you know not just in
some tribe but in the whole world at the
same time robots are coming on
board oh is that a
coincidence what what do we what exactly
would we point to to to to say that
that's a coincidence is it just that
technology has that has that side effect
that it makes you want to have fewer
kids because the economy goes a certain
way I don't know but now they have a
robot that you can put with your kid so
it's like a little robot friend you know
you could put it with like a you know
two-year-old and just S talks to him and
acts like a little
friend that is one degree away from
being the kid
itself right now if you think that
people won't be replacing human children
with
robots you're going to be
wrong humans will replace the idea of
having a human child with a robot
they're going to say it's
cheaper they're going to say it's less
you know less worry because you you know
if it gets hit by a car you just upgrade
it and download the brain again uh it's
going to keep you company it never needs
to go to sleep it won't Jewel on you now
you're going to say to me but SC Scott
this will never have the appeal of a
human baby like you can't even
understand it and I'm going to say
that's my point you think you're making
your point that a human baby is so much
better and if if you could if you could
understand that and if you could if you
could hold your own baby which I've
never done by the way hold your own
biological baby Scott you would know
that nobody nobody is going to prefer a
robot over that to which I say what if
you haven't done that what if you've
never experienced it like
me and you said do you want to be lonely
or do you want to have a robot because
you can't afford a real kid or maybe you
don't have a
partner there are a lot of people who
are going to say I get what you're
saying that a real one if you know if I
were in a family and I had money and I
were a certain age and everything worked
out and I were healthy and I'd rather
have a human
baby but I think you might find this
something like half of all the
population says you know the human baby
thing I love it but it's out of it's Out
Of
Reach but I'd sure like to have a little
friend and these two things are
happening at the same time same time the
population and and the baby shortage is
on is the same time that the baby
Replacements are being
built and and all that happened after a
million years of human ution those two
things happen at the same
time like it doesn't that feel like too
much of a
coincidence I don't
know maybe it's just a natural outcome
of high technology and an economy that
went a certain way so maybe it's not
that big of a coincidence but just feels
weird that these two Happ things happen
at the same
time and yes real babies are better all
right here's a story that I have to
admit I don't understand at all you know
I don't follow events in the
UK so every time there's a big story
over there and somebody I remember when
people were asking me about brexit in
the beginning people say hey what do you
think about brexit and I'd say that
sounds like something happening in
another
country I didn't have any interest at
all I didn't know what it was didn't
didn't feel like any interest to look it
up and it wasn't until it passed that I
thought H maybe I should see what that
is kind of look into it a little bit but
maybe I don't understand it still
because here's what I'm going to what
here's what's in the news and I don't
get what I'm seeing and reading so the
British prime minister K starmer he
saying in public he just did a speech he
said that uh illegal migration to the UK
has been uh By Design and he says
basically the country is being
destroyed by immigration policies that
were formed deliberately
what what am I
missing isn't he on the team that wanted
this do do I have everything about UK
politics backwards I thought starer was
one of the people who's in favor of a
liberal
immigration do I have that actually
backwards do I not even know who's the
left from the right over there what's
going
on start yeah right I'm seeing in the
comments that Storer is the one doing it
so are you as confused as I
am you're confused right and then he
blamed brexit he said that brexit was
used to turn uh the UK I guess into some
big experiment on open borders and I
said wait a minute I only did five
minutes of research into brexit but I
thought that was the opposite of
that so it's not me right it's not me
being confused
you're also confused
right so they're trying to so oh so
they're trying to blame uh okay so this
would be similar to uh Democrats blaming
Trump for the open border because he was
against that uh that policy that was so
stupid that nobody should vote for
it uh so this is
gaslighting right it that's all it is
it's just gaslighting there's nothing
else to it right
weird
well I'll say again um I don't
consider UK to be an ally of the United
States at the moment at least in the way
that we would expect people to act as an
ally on paper sure sure on paper but no
not really and and my my feeling that we
need to come rescue you if you're in
trouble is going way down because I feel
like you're more on the other side than
on our side so you better work that out
UK but uh there are people I'm seeing a
lot of stories that suggest that Europe
is essentially a goner that widespread
immigration will change everything about
Europe until it's
unrecognizable but here's something
nobody's nobody has uh suggested yet you
want to hear the most provocative um
prediction that you'll ever hear in your
life you ready for this
what
happens when the the natives of UK and
other parts of Europe who have let's say
lived in a mostly white environment and
got used to it find that they become
mostly you know a big mix of
other um other migrants and other
cultures and they say I can't handle
this anymore because they're they're
talking about Sharia law and and we
might be like 3 years away from
implementing Sharia law and I can't take
it where are they going to
go so here's my
prediction I think there's going to be
an enormous white flight out of Europe
in Great
Britain and I think that they will
probably look at the United States and
say hey you guys have a population
problem over there and we'd say
we do thanks for noticing do you have a
population problem over there yeah we
kind of do you know what would be maybe
kind of
cool don't you come over here solve our
population problem solve your population
problem solve your cultural problem if
you're not comfortable being in the
culture that's developing over there I
think there's going to be a gigantic
European white migration into the United
States if our government
were to approve that now there might be
just you know might be a lot of other
immigration too not just that but I feel
like the uh I feel like white Europeans
are going to be claiming Asylum very
soon do you Ma imagine if you're a just
a middle class white person living in
Great Britain and let's say gangs
form and the gangs start you know
terrorizing your neighborhood so you go
to your government and the government
does nothing because they got too many
other problems so if your government
won't stop a gang from taking over your
town and you come and you apply for
asylum in the United States what do we
say do we say that's not good enough
because your government is not after you
it's just that they're not helping or do
we say yeah I understand you've got
nobody helping you and you're in the
middle of a gang situation get on over
here we'll give you a job tomorrow
so I think
Europe may become the United States
after a while I think I we we may be
taking everybody who can get
away that's probably five years away
meanwhile weird things are happening in
Syria which I also do not understand
it's a weird day of not understanding
the news because the headlines aren't
matching any model in my head that makes
sense for example
sea Davis he's a Founder head of the
Federalist um he says what's happening
in Syria is that the CIA neocons are
trying to start one last war in Syria
before Trump is inaugurated and they're
using Al-Qaeda and Isis terrorists to do
it now that's because uh
Aleppo City in Syria um which had the
Syrian Army in control apparently the
Syrian Army is in retreat because the I
don't know if you call them Rebels or
terrorists or are they or are they not
working with the CIA we don't know but
whoever whoever the uh the rebels are
they seem to have taken the city without
much trouble there's a separate report
that the Syrian Army's small uh
communication devices
exploded do you think that somebody did
a hezel on them and made their small
communic ation devices explode and was
that just ahead of the Rebel attack
which would kind of suggest either
Israel or the United States was in on
it well uh let's see according to
Richard
grenell uh he says Russia seems to be
letting the Syrian rebels overthrow
Assad he says that's big and it's time
to play chess okay what is
happening why in what world would Russia
want
the re the terrorist Rebels and or even
the United States helping them to to
win and take over
Syria what what is that about does
anybody understand this story and so the
New York Post says the Syrian military
said on Saturday that uh you know dozens
of his troops have been killed and the
insurgents so I guess they're calling
them
insurgents uh have a large part of the
city uh under their control now that's
one city
so I don't know so what does it mean
when Richard grenell who knows more than
all of us about what's happening over
there right because he's an
international uh
expert what does he mean when he says
it's time to play
chess well let us speculate shall we do
some recreational
speculation let's let's take the
optimistic view of this you
ready this has something to do with
Ukraine this has something to
do with Gaza and Hezbollah and
Iran this has something to do
with the deal of the
centur I don't know but you feel the
Trump effect right there's something
happening in the country nay the world
that has everything to do with the fact
that Trump is
back I think this is that now when Rich
Richard grenell kind of vaguely refers
to playing
chess that's kind of a reference to
Trump isn't it you know he's he's our 4D
chess player and Putin's the other chess
master
when you're talking
chess doesn't that feel like you're
talking Putin and
Trump don't don't you just hear that
when you hear chess in this
context so there's something I've been
teaching you for a long time about
negotiating do you remember what it is
that fits this situation perfectly let
me remind
you here's two people who can't make a
deal hey I want this hey hey I also want
that oh oh we can't make a deal I guess
we're done I guess we have to kill each
other or something okay that's two
people who don't know how to make a deal
now let's replace them with two 4D chess
players I want a but I want a to but you
can't have it I'll kill you no I want it
I want it what's the next thing they
do next thing they do is they sweeten
the deal by saying all right we both
want a but you know what we also both
want B and C but you want E I don't care
about E I could help you with f and you
know G through M are kind of interesting
to both of us because we'd both like to
let's say fight terrorism in general
we'd both like to have good economies
we'd like to not get in this trouble
again with another War we'd like to do
something about nuclear we'd like to do
something about energy we like to do
something about the Middle East we'd
like to figure out uh how to keep our
Maritime traffic
safe now it gets
interesting because now you're talking
about a deal that involves the Middle
East maybe you're giving
maybe
maybe Trump promised Russia a warm water
report because we don't care too much
about that but there's some we do
want maybe Trump has already offered the
deal of the century and I don't know
what elements would be in it but if you
were simply take everything that that
Russia wants and you know write it down
and then write everything that the
United States wants and then throw in a
few other countries you know Israel
Ukraine China China maybe have to watch
this I think China has to set this one
out if if Trump is playing the deal of
the
century then at the very least it's
going to put some distance between
Russia and
China because why wouldn't we ask for
everything it's the deal of the century
I think the Golden Age requires the
biggest deal we've ever
seen and I've been saying this for a
million
years
Russia is a natural Ally of the United
States now it helps that we don't have a
border with
them they're not such a natural athlet
they're not that much of a natural Ally
to people who share a border but a
little bit of that has to do with
protecting themselves from
us
so I think the longrun Arc of history is
that Russia's best life is to be our
best
friend but not to try to be our
Superior and I think that Trump and
Putin could work that that out because
you if you look at the the entire uh
economy of Russia it's tiny compared to
the United States we could promise Putin
that we could triple his economy and it
would come nowhere near competing with
us nowhere near so we can say how about
we help you triple your economy we just
got to get out of this this military
stuff we just have to look past that
because nobody's winning the one thing
that Ukraine bought us that it'll take
us a long time to understand how good it
was because there were so many deaths
involved of course we see it as a
tragedy but once once we have some
distance to it here's what I
think I think it might be the last land
War because there's no way that a land
War can work I mean if if Ukraine didn't
prove for sure that land
War you know unless it's some special
situation where somebody has no
protection whatsoever but generally
speaking
I think it's the end of the land War and
the only way you could know that it
doesn't work is by doing exactly what
they did trying as hard as they can on
the land and watching it not
work at
all so what is the potential
size of the deal of the
century
enormous I think that it would involve
everything from peace in the Middle East
including
Iran to
Ukraine to
Syria I think if Trump is playing this
as smart as I think he is and his
advisers are as good as I think they
are uh Russia gained 10 trillion in
Mineral wealth how's how's that
relevant because if the United States
hadn't been there they would have had
all of
Ukraine so nobody got what they
wanted right nobody got what they
wanted some got something but nobody got
what they
wanted all right and by the way those of
you who want to say in the comments that
I'm uninformed instead of just telling
me something I need to know
you stop being that way like does does
your family hate you do do you have to
say something bad about me in order to
give me some information that might be
useful to both of us like at what Point
did you say I think I'll be an
to communicate this
information how about fix your game a
little bit there huh yeah take your game
up a little bit you need you need to you
need to raise your level a little bit
that that's not something I need to put
up
with all
right anyway deal of the century maybe
here is something the Gateway pundit is
reporting but has been in other places
as well are you aware that there have
been unidentified drone
swarms that have been making
regular regular
foras uh
around American Military
facilities for at least a
year so and there are three Core US
forces in Europe I guess so there have
been a number of times when a swarm now
I don't they don't say how big a swarm
is but imagine looking in the sky and
seeing something that looks like a a
swarm of birds except that it's um it's
it's
drones and that these
drones fly around completely unaffected
like there's no set there's no defense
against them none is
launched and they're just and then they
leave and we don't know for sure who's
sending
them who do you think is sending them
some of the speculation is that they
could be coming from cargo ships off
offshore um which would sort of suggest
China if I had to guess I'd say China is
testing our
defenses because China knows that
they're going to be the leader of
manufacturing we will we won't catch up
with them in manufacturing and that the
number and quality of drones will
determine everything about the future of
military
power and so it could be that Russia
there I'm guessing China but it really
it's just a guess is testing our
military response to see if they can put
a thousand drones over any military base
which would be effectively enough to
take it out probably um with no with no
defense now it does make me wonder you
know does the US have some kind of a
defense but they haven't rolled it down
to every base so and they don't want to
use it unless it's an actual War because
we don't want to give away our secrets
and stuff so we might have some kind of
Defense I'm I hope if I heard that this
was happening on a regular basis and I
were the head of our military I'm pretty
sure that same day I would be assigning
somebody to be in charge of figuring out
how to knock down a swarm of drones I'm
sure that's all on
underway but uh
wow that uh I'll tell you one of the
things that I always carry in my
mind is that whatever anybody says about
their own military is probably
fake so we talk about the you know
amazing amazing American Military and I
do believe we could beat just about
anybody in a conventional War but I also
believe that there
gigantic gigantic
vulnerabilities for even the best
militaries and this might be ours
we might have this gigantic
vulnerability and our government doesn't
want to tell you because guess what we
couldn't win a war that we might be at
the point where we can't win a war with
with China however I don't think China
wants a war I think they want to make
sure that they don't have a war because
they could just win economically and by
having more babies if they can do it so
far they can't have more
babies um did you
know that there is a was it the uh who
was reporting
this I can't remember if it was the
Vigilant Fox I think it
was there there are several uh accounts
on X that have independent journalists
that I I use their material more than
most because they have better reporting
frankly but uh one of them is the
Vigilant Fox another is George another
is the amuse account
um Colin
rug
cernovich I I should mention them more
often because if you follow those those
same independent people you'll you have
a whole different view of the
world anyway did you know that there's
some kind of a powerful online tool that
only special select mainstream reporters
have access to where the
government essentially tells them how to
report the news that hasn't dropped yet
do you believe
that yeah do you think that's true that
that there's a well-known at least
within the the media that there's a
website that not everybody has access
to but it gets you ready so that your
narrative about what's going to break in
the news you I guess about the
government um is sort of
coordinated is this as bad as this
sounds you know part of me thinks that
they could have thought of it as just a
good way to make sure everybody gets
equal information at the same time so
that they're not playing favorites
except that it's not available to
everybody so so obviously it is playing
favorites I guess I need to know more
about this because it would seem like
it's nothing but a brainwashing
tool no surprise there uh we we've all
noticed that the the Democrat and the
mainstream media their their messaging
is identical at the same time we've all
seen it but didn't you wonder how it
happened I always thought it
happened by
memo I always thought that the Democrats
simply literally put out a memo and said
hey here's how we're going to talk about
this and then the mainstream media would
just you know conform
does that happen on the
right so I've been doing this you know
live streaming and posting and stuff
talking about politics
for years now and nobody on the right
has ever communicated with me or said
here's the memo here's the way we're
going to talk about this have any of you
seen
it because because I can't believe that
I would be left out of the loop if there
a loop but I don't think there is a loop
is
there because I notice that sometimes
you know I'll see a a prominent right
leaning person uh with an opinion and
then I'll turn on say Fox News later and
I'll see something kind of compatible
with what that first influencer said so
I think that on the
right the news is getting its take from
an organic sense of what the you know
the smart people are saying and and I
feel like by the time you get to the
afternoon
opinions those opinions have at least
been bounced off of all the sort of the
smart internet dads and so they've got
an idea what's what's dumb what's not
what What will what will the people who
watch Fox News think is a good idea what
will they think is a bad idea so to me
it's just like the
election where the Democrats simply
assigned you know assigned their
their candidate but on the Republican
side it was a fight you know whole
primary did it the whole way you know
you you got to prove yourself the whole
way and I think the right does that with
the
news I think that people get the news
they do their takes I think if I have a
good take the odds of me seeing it come
out somewhere are pretty good have you
noticed that have any of you noticed
that if I have a good take it seems like
it spreads but I'm not the only one
right Soo I like to use him as an
example Jack pabic you know there there
are a bunch of people that if they have
a good take you see it immediately other
people go yeah that's a good take oh
I'll boost
that anyway very different on the other
side um according to the amuse account
the other one that you should
follow on X um the Trump's distrust of
the FBI is so deep he's going to
bypass uh them for nominee background
checks I'm sorry he's not going to use
the FBI for the nominee background
checks he's going to use private
entities because he doesn't trust the
FBI huh so he's basically sidelining the
FBI until he can get his own trusted
people in there and then start cleaning
house
um I would love to know just how how bad
the FBI
is my guess is that almost all of the
rank and file are just doing their job
would you say that that's true almost
all of them are are just you know going
to work doing their job serving the
country but boy the leadership
yikes it it seems to me that the
leadership of the FBI I don't have any
trust and by the way I don't think
that's new I think that maybe since
Hoover you give any entity that much
private information about the citizens
and you get to this point so it might be
that the FBI just has to be completely
dismantled every 10
years that that might you should build
that into the law every 10 years every
single executive at the FBI has to be
replaced because I don't know what else
you can do if you leave people there for
years they learn how to consolidate
power and then then they just take it
anyway uh unusual whales there's another
good account you should follow it's
called unusual Wales and with there's a
lowercase Dash between unusual and Wales
very good account for following the
Independent
News um says that billionaire bill akman
um billionaires Bill akman Mark Andre
and Travis kenck he's the Uber
guy are reportedly getting involved in
Doge now this is according to Fortune
now fortune
um I don't consider them a credible
publication you know Dilbert has been on
the cover of Fortune Magazine I know six
or eight times uh but that's back when
they were a
legitimate sort of a legitimate uh
entity I don't know if you could say
that about them
now um but this is their uh scoop I
guess now here here's my take listen to
these names again Bill Amman Mark Andre
and
Travis kic
kadic what do they all have in common
besides being super
rich Common
Sense common
sense like if you wanted to solve a
problem and you didn't care anything
about politics you would call one of
these three right no politics at all
just what works what doesn't work
there's three people you'd call how
about Elon
Musk if you had a problem that needed to
be solved and there was no politics
involved whatsoever Elon Musk that
that's who you call right the who do you
call the vake right JD Vance um tulsy
gabard very RFK Jr
so it could be that the pirate ship is
getting
bigger but
wait is that all remember I told you
recently that all the smart people are
on the same side they're not all going
public about it but let me say it again
all the smart people are on the same
side if you don't know the Silicon
Valley world it's not as easy to SM to
spot the Smart Ones but you know I kind
of live close enough that I know who
they
are let me say it again as clear as
possible all the Smart Ones are on the
same
side all of them you just don't know it
because they can't all go public so
you're going to see you know one by one
people saying I think it's safe now so
it's going to be like little prairie
dogs safe okay I'm
out now this is where um I don't think I
can take credit for this but I'll just
say it as a
fact we only got
here because people like me were willing
to get
cancelled like we you know the the
Pioneers had to get cancelled before we
could get to the point where other
people would say this is too far if the
only thing that ever happened was
Rosanne got cancelled and we thought it
was very
unfair it wouldn't change
much but if enough people get canceled
and enough things are going wrong and
the border is open and the economy looks
stupid then the dads say too far too far
that this now stops uh but you're going
to get in trouble and you're going to
get a lot of push back if you go public
do you understand too far too far is
when it doesn't matter what happens to
me that's when the dads come out the
dads come out when they say it doesn't
matter what happens to me this is too
far there there there's no risk too big
there's no no wall too strong no Hill
too high this is too far and now we're
going to turn it
around Story number
two Donald Trump has been secretly
according to the New York Post Trump has
been talking to what they call his man
cross Jamie
Diamond about the White House agenda now
Jamie Diamond as you remember famously
and bravely bravely is very important
here famously and bravely said in a some
big interview might have been CNBC
recently hey you know Trump's not wrong
about everything now he did not endorse
Trump and I don't ask him to I I think
CEOs can get along without endorsing
people that'd be
fine but it was very clear that Jaimie
diamond is a common sense guy he doesn't
have that job because he got lucky right
it's not he's not a Dei hire like he's
really really smart and really really
focused on what makes sense and common
sense that's why he is so does it does
it surprise you that Trump likes Jamie
Diamond it shouldn't he's exactly the
kind of person that Trump responds to
because he's not going to agree with him
on everything but it's going to be a
smart smart disagreement if he
disagrees so I'm not going to say that
Jamie Diamond has entered the pirate
ship but he's knocking on the
door all
right
um so over on MSNBC they had a
guest uh named Kai kanduri he's one of
these uh wide-eyed political strategists
you know the ones whose eyes are too
big like why are your eyes so open why
is it that all the people who have weird
things to say have have wide eyes let me
tell you about Trump being a
dictator anyway um his take is that uh
Elon Musk naming this government
efficiency thing doge is of course as
you know the name of a doge coin the
name of a cryptocurrency which you also
know that uh musk had four years uh
largely looked like a practical jokeer
just having fun pretending that this one
crypto you know was like the fun one one
to have and speculation that he might
own a lot of it
himself I would agree that's probably
right probably true and that he would he
might be making a big uh like a big win
on these dogecoins and so really it's a
conflict of
interest do you know what's the smallest
problem I have in the
world if I were to rank all the things
that I got a problem with with in the
world do you know what would be last on
my list of like 10,000 things that are a
problem that the richest man in the
world may have some other way to make a
few
[Laughter]
bucks but if you think he's doing the
whole Doge project simply to boost his
Dogecoin
value you're an idiot you're an
idiot MSNBC is just the idiot that work
you're you're either mentally ill or you
just is an idiot right now could could
it be true that in his mind um Elon mus
said you know what this is kind of fun
because the letters worked out Doge it
wasn't even his idea but he thought it
was funny and he adopted it do you think
that Elon Musk is aware that his own
value in his dogecoins could go up a
substantial amount I mean you know who
knows maybe it's a billion dollar do you
think he's aware of that of course he
is where does that come in in his
thinking nowhere nowhere it it's not in
the top hundred things he has anything
to care about he's building a now he's
building his own uh uh game Factory to
make video
games he he's trying to take us to
Mars he's trying to make you know
starlink work and he's uh you know he's
building
robots do you think he really gives
two poops about
Dogecoin I mean he might as a joke but
no he's not he's not doing anything
because of Doge it's not why he's doing
the project so if you want the worst
takes in the world MSNBC has
them well meanwhile on uh I think it
might have been
Ms Ms
Ms the other one
CNBC uh Dr gotle was talking about his
concern about RFK Jr now Insurrection
Barbie who's another account you should
be following on X Insurrection Barbie I
have no idea who Insurrection Barbie is
I don't know if it's male or female but
wow really good good
independent stuff so I'd love to know
more about that account because it seems
a little too wise for an anonymous
account there's probably somebody
powerful behind that but I don't know
who it is
anyway uh Insurrection Barbie talks
about Dr gotle this way said this is the
guy who resigned from his post as the
head of the FDA and within two months
joined the board of directors of
fizer uh this is the guy who spent all
of 2020 and 2021 going on msnb MSNBC and
CNN and making covid predictions without
disclosing he was on the board of
directors at
fizer H in fact he was introduced as a
former FDA
commissioner did that really
happen did one of these two networks
they're not insturction Barbie doesn't
say which one but did one of those
networks have somebody who was on the
board of directors of fizer talking
about this
topic and introduced them as a former
FDA commissioner instead of a current
board member of fizer did that really
happen you that sounds like it might
have been a mistake it doesn't sound
like I mean I hope it was a mistake my
God and uh in Direction Barbie says
bring bringing people uh like him to
discuss healthc care is people why have
is why people have no trust in the
Health Care System well that's one
reason that's one reason we don't have
trust in
it let me tell you I heard some things
during the pandemic that I can't tell
you because I'll get sued but
it's maybe the worst thing I've ever
heard like one of the worst crimes I've
ever heard in my life but I can't tell
you about it
anyway um I saw I saw these reports that
Baron Trump and Melania had been
debanked and I thought it was some kind
of
joke like who who's going to
debank you know the the first lady and
the president's son they got
banked that actually
happened and uh I think it was Bill
Amman who said name the
bank
because this is Dad business apparently
this debank was really widespread but
not widely reported there were a lot of
people who got debanked and it wasn't
just crypto people who were trying to be
clever it was
Melania and baron
now when you start adding up all the
people who got
debanked somebody needs to go to
jail I don't know
who but I didn't know this was happening
I had no idea this was
happening wow so Bill Amman says name
name the bank and I don't think we have
the name of the banks speculation but we
don't know the name of the bank I want
to know the name of the bank too because
if it's my bank I'm going to take
everything out of it
it I I've had my bank since I was uh
21 same bank I don't care about anything
else if you
debanked Milani and
baron you don't get my money I'm taking
every penny out so let's find out what
that bank was because if I have to make
a change I want to get on
it you're shocked I didn't get debanked
already so am I I'm trying to figure out
why I didn't get debanked but I don't
know I don't
know um Megan Kelly has a video out in
which she's saying that uh she wants
some tip for Tat she says on the lawfare
and thinks that uh going hard at largely
Democrats who had been doing terrible
things for years might be the only way
we get back to some kind of you know
mutually assured destruction balance in
the country
I am super uncomfortable about
that because I don't think that's the
way we should talk about
it I definitely think that everybody who
broke a law needs to answer for
it I don't think we should go easy on
them because they didn't go easy on
anybody else but I don't want this to
turn into law fair so this is one of
those it's not good enough to not have a
conflict of interest you have to look
like you don't have a conflict of
interest right now when she talks about
it she's not talking about a conflict of
interest it would be just the law doing
what the law does and the law should do
catch people and punish them for bad
things so that part is fine the trouble
is that when the the influencers start
talking like
this it goes into the IT drifts into the
category of it gives the impression of
lawfare we you can't give the impression
of law
fair because even if you say but but
it's not real law fair it's no no you
can't you can't settle for either one
you can't have the lawfare but you you
also can't create a situation where
everybody thinks you're law fairing both
are seriously noo zones so while I'm
completely in
agreement with there looks like there
have been horrible crimes against one
part of the country and they do have to
be addressed and I do think a number of
people need to be seriously
jailed but we can't go over over the
line of you know really good
evidence people being convicted in a way
that people normally are convicted you
know no special cases uh I don't like
the idea it was it was mentioned that
maybe some laws need to be changed just
so you can go after people no no not I
realize I did that egene Carrol thing
but uh I think Reed Hoffman has already
said he wants to leave the
country so Reed Hoffman is the one who
funded the Egan Carol
thing so Reed Hoffman may may get paid
back in
kind now
again if he committed no crimes or no
crimes that people would normally be
charged with I'm not in favor of that at
all but if there is anything there that
anybody knows about they're probably
going to use that to pay him back for
the EEG Carol thing because the EEG
Carol thing was the height of bad
behavior in my opinion I I don't think
you can have more bad behavior than that
while still being legal it was all legal
but they had to change the law just to
go after Trump nope no you don't get to
change the law just to go after Trump if
you do that somebody's going to get
payback I don't know you I don't know
but yeah there's going to be payback for
that
because that was not within in my
opinion that was outside the legal
system technically within it but not
really not really so I wouldn't go
beyond that because that was a case
where where somebody went
beyond so if somebody went beyond and
then the response is also a little bit
beyond but also legal completely
legal then I'm not going to fight with
that one but I wouldn't want to see some
kind of like larger
you know process for punishing Democrats
who just said bad things or
whatever uh likewise Elon Musk
suggesting that
vinman committed treason and will
pay again that would sound
like especially because he LS close to
the president at the PO at the moment
that sounds too much like law fair to me
but here's the interesting update on
this I didn't realize that he said this
um in the context of people saying that
he's have that musk is having
conversations with
Putin do you think Putin's the one who
dropped the dime on
vinman is it
possible that the deal of the
century could involve Putin getting some
payback that he
wants is it possible that Putin wants
vinman in jail
and that one of 5050 different things
they're talking about from Syria to Iran
to Ukraine to who knows what is it
possible if inman's part of the
conversation and that Putin just said do
me a
favor you got to get rid of this guy
because he just created a war like no
other War which he might have I I don't
know if that's true I can't claim that
but I know he's being accused of you
know being UNH helpful let's say
um I don't know I got a lot of questions
about the vinman situation nothing looks
right
there according I was reading the George
account on X he was talking about mayor
Eric Adams and now it looks like the
charges are pretty seriously he took
some gifts
and um and took some uh political
contributions from foreign countries and
entities that were pretending that they
were coming from different places than
they were Etc so they look like pretty
serious charges but according to the
George
account um there is conversation about
Trump pardoning
him why would he do
that why would he pardon mayor Adams
because if the crimes he's being charged
with are
true I don't see the reason for the
pardon what's the argument for that
because I don't think there's a
political
benefit to the country there there are
other pardons where you could see that
maybe somebody else benefits but who
would benefit besides mayor
Adams and again I kind of like mayor
Adams you know I I would have loved
mayor Adams to have been a
Republican and not to have any not to
have any charges over him because he
seems like a really like capable
guy I kind of like his whole vibe but I
hope I hope he didn't didn't do these
things uh but as George says and I
concur um we're not going to talk about
any Democrat pardons until every January
6 where is out a jail is everybody on
the same
page I don't want to hear one Democrat
got a pardon until 100% of the January 6
is round now I used to
say 100% of them that didn't do any
violence or you know an actual crime
like a serious crime bre other than just
you know obstruction and wandering
around where you're not where you're not
supposed to be but I'm I'm updating that
now I think everyone and the reason I
say everyone is you have to make
statement if you do everyone it's a
statement and the statement is some
things are more
important and I think that their freedom
is more important than somebody did some
graffiti and as much as I don't approve
if anybody you know heard a law
enforcement person
those law enforcement people were hurt
by their own people because they were
sent into a situation in which they
could have had full reinforcements and
they didn't so yes the January Sixers
might have been the ones who landed the
blow and created some serious injuries
in some cases and that's no joke but
none of that would have happened if
their own team had done what they should
have been doing and it looks like an OP
to me so to me it looks like those those
law enforcement people were thrown to
the wolves
in a way that didn't have to happen and
there would have been no violence or
much less if they had come in force and
done the right thing and not let people
in etc
etc so I say every one of them has to be
um
released meanwhile um Angela Ry who
apparently is appears on The Breakfast
Club a lot I didn't know her too much
except as a social media person who has
some
opinions and she said uh I spent so much
time over the last couple of weeks just
focusing on the half of the country that
I hate right
now that I
despise she's talking about the Trump
voters
here she also said she can no longer
trust people around her because they
they could have also secretly voted for
Trump so she's worried about the secret
Trump voters
too and she says I don't even know if at
this point people will be honest about
their reasons for voting for The Other
Side or if they'll be honest about who
they really voted
for well I have two comments about this
number one it turns out that when you
are the problem you can't identify the
problem have you noticed
that the closer someone is to being the
exact problem the less able they are to
see it because they're looking around
and they don't see it like
hey is it here is it here where is it is
it turns out that your eyeballs can't
reverse so that you can see your own
brain and and say oh oh my God I am the
problem so that's
funny um but the other thing
is that that she just did what I got
canceled
for I got canceled saying that there's
some group of people
they have a bad feeling about me and I
think I would stay away from them
because I can't tell which
individuals like me and which
individuals don't so if I can't tell but
I can confirm for sure that some portion
of them want something bad to happen to
me or at least don't consider me a full
person then I would stay away from the
whole group even though that's terribly
unfair because there might be wonderful
individuals within the group
now realistically I never changed
anything that you know I was doing in
the real world and I have lots of black
friends and and N I don't think a
single I'm not sure but I don't think I
I don't think I lost a single black
friend I can't think of one I lost
several white friends because they were
mad on behalf of somebody else but
anybody who actually listened to what I
said said some version of well that
makes sense here's what I said in
summary
and I and I'll turn it around so so you
can see it from
reverse if you're a black family and
you're thinking moving to a new town and
let's say you've narrowed it down to two
choices they're both really good towns
but one of them is famous for having a
lot of KKK people living there you don't
know who they are because it's a secret
organization but you know that 20% of
the
Town belongs to the KKK the other town
is just a regular town
which one do you live
in now if you tell me well of course I
don't go to the one that has secret 20%
haters then I say oh so you're racist
because you're going to treat everybody
in that town like they're in the KKK
when only 20% are and then said black
family that is very smart would say are
you crazy this is just
self-defense wh why would I ever go and
put myself in the middle of a danger
which is well
identified to which I say exactly
exactly if somebody comes in and asks
for a
job then you find out what what's up
with that one person and there's no
reason to discriminate against one
person and I often say the argument for
being a discriminator against one person
whoever that is doesn't make sense
because that's never going to be good
for the person you discriminated against
duh
but it's also not good for you because
you just limited the number of people
that you can consider for jobs and
romance and friends and partners and
sports and everything else so why would
you decrease your own
options unless you're such a racist that
you think that every single person of
some group everyone is worse than every
other person from some other group and
that's you know kind of just bad
crazy so there's no actual
argument that makes sense for treating
an individual like the average of the
whatever group they're from there's none
so to imagine that I would do that is
sort of call me stupid it's not even
like an opinion it's just stupid but for
self-defense if you know one group has
20% haters and yeah you want to stay
away so that's why Angela Ry is saying
she believes that uh there are all these
terrible magga people and she'd like to
make sure that she doesn't have as much
contact with them CU she can't tell
which ones are the bad magas and which
ones are not
however well I I could assure
Angela that if she is nice to people
every magga person will be nice to her
in return guarantee
it I guarantee it because that's who
they are you just have to be a
reasonable person who likes you know the
con Constitution the law the country
likees your family and you're nice to
your
neighbor we're all
in all
right Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau I
guess he dined with the
president-elect Trump at maralago is it
my imagination or has maral Lago already
become the White House but it's the fun
White House it's the fun White House
right is there any compelling reason for
Trump to uh be in the Oval Office ever
again I say
no because apparently they've figured
out how to do good security at Mar Lago
so if the neighbors don't mind they
might mind so that could be an issue but
um just make it the White House why does
he have to live why does Trump have to
go where the weather is bad he doesn't
he doesn't have to go where the
weather's bad he he can just stay at
Mara Lago and have people come to him
so but here's what I'm loving about this
story if America had a functional
president meaning Biden or a functional
vice president then I think people would
complain about the fact that Trudeau had
a meeting with
Trump because even if the meeting was
not for the purpose of negotiating a
binding agreement and it probably
wasn't it's impossible POS for two
leaders to spend that much time together
without doing something that looks like
negotiating because there simply the
process of talking about their
priorities ends up being a
pre-negotiation at the very least so why
are people not
complaining about Trump doing one of the
very worst things you can do which is
negotiating with a foreign leader before
you in
office I have a
hypothesis and it goes like like
this that the golden age is returning
common
sense and that whether you're on the
left or the right you're completely
aware that we're
leaderless and that we're better off
even if you don't think Trump is your
best choice we're much better off if the
world looks over here and says oh
Trump's already in
charge because that makes you
safer I I want I want every country to
know somebody's in charge
that's really
important because if they thought nobody
was in charge maybe something different
would happen
now the fact that we're not seeing a big
push back and it's just such an obvious
line of attack oh Trump is breaking
another law oh we'd better get a special
Council to look into him negotiating
before he
president everybody's just shutting the
 up which is ex exactly Common Sense
yes you've got a lot more to worry about
than this yes I want my my pre-present
to be talking to these leaders yes yes
yes and is it is it a little bit
illegal I don't care if you don't
care is that fair I mean if the
situation were reversed I'd still be
okay with it if Trump were in office and
he were vegetable and and some you know
young with it Democrat was in charge and
I was like ah not my first choice but I
want somebody to be in charge I'd be
okay with it so I I to me this feels
optimistic it's optimistic as the dog
not barking which would be MSNBC
complaining that he's negotiating with a
foreign leader before he's in office
they're letting it go common sense is
winning and I love the fact that the
Trump effect is so strong that Trudeau
knew he needed to go to maralago and not
wait the the urgency with which these
leaders are acting it it tells you a lot
so the Trump effect is incredible right
now like you can feel everything is
different you know suddenly common sense
is allowed like you can just say things
that are obvious and real and it felt
like you couldn't do it
before we were in some kind of crazy
land well also according to the uh the
Vigilant Fox account on X uh the editor
and chief of the hill is predicting that
Laura Trump will someday run for
president because she has that kind of
talent
now here's my input on that so I've uh
I've talked to Laura Trump twice I guess
uh she's interviewed me by video so I
haven't better in person but we've had
two extended video
conversations
and here are just here my takes in no
particular
order one thing you need if you're going
to have a female president especially if
it's going to be the first one is
strength right even more so than if it
was a ordinary you know ordinary guy you
wouldn't need him to be like a an
athlete or anything because you know
it's just what we're used to but the
first woman is going to get all kinds of
you know are you strong enough right are
you strong enough nobody's gonna ask
Laura Trump if she's strong
enough or tough enough because it's just
so obvious I mean you look at her
physicality uh the way she controls her
body uh you talk to her for five minutes
you know that she's serious and you also
know in five minutes that you wouldn't
want to be on the other side of any
disagreement with her and then we also
watched that she apparently did a great
job with the the DNC sorry the
RNC so you've got the brains you've got
the Hollywood looks you've got the let
me say it as directly as possible in a
fair fight she could beat
me right so I mean it's not like I I can
beat too many people in the fair fight
but
she's got the power like if you're
looking for strength yeah it's all there
so she's got the Charisma the brains the
strength the connections she's got the
drive I'm sure I think she has the right
ambition and the right the right ideas
for the
country I'm all in I'm all in someday
someday we might have that conversation
or somebody
will
anyway uh according to New York post
zalinski says he is willing to seed
territory to Russia in exchange for NATO
protection but not being in Nat I
guess and that would be the first time
that he said that what does that sound
like it's the Trump effect it's the
Trump
effect here's here's why I think Trump
is a different kind of
negotiator I feel like
Biden is asking people what they'd be
okay with
and Trump is telling them what they're
going to be okay
with do you catch the
difference you know would you do this no
well what am I do now all right you're
going to do
this very different I can tell you this
story I think I told before uh the best
salesperson I ever met who was not Trump
uh worked in the syndication company
that was selling the dilbur comic to
newspapers and he held an event and he
asked me if I would uh be a speaker at
his event because there was a bunch of
newspaper editors and I never did that
kind of thing but for some reason when
he asked me you know partly because he
was selling my comic successfully I said
yes so so the first thing I noticed was
huh he he's the best salesperson and he
just sold me on something I always said
no
to but said yes to him so I go there I
give my speech and then afterwards some
of the editors are coming up to to say
hi and stuff and one of the editors
comes up and he says uh you know I I I
didn't like your comic I wasn't really
sold on running it in my
newspaper um but the salesman told me I
should and I said what he goes yeah you
know I wasn't sold on it but he told me
I should run it and I
thought how does it work that the
salesperson tells you what to do I
thought well what kind of salesperson
does that
and then amazingly some other
independent person comes up to me a few
minutes later and
says the same thing I wasn't going to
buy this but your salesperson told me to
get it and I said
what what what what am what am I even
observing here and and here's the
difference I think this is my best
hypothesis that the salesperson was so
good that he was allowing these
professionals to use him as a consultant
actually of what they should do in their
newspaper so he had somehow reframed
himself as the consultant and not the
salesperson he would not only tell them
what they should put in but he would
then tell them which which comic to
remove to make space for it he'd say all
right here you go so you got these three
down here these are the ones you want to
replace I've got this one um you'll want
to put this one in right
away and then they'll say how much is it
and you'll say this much he goes all
right and then he walks out with the
sale so I
believe that there's some salespeople
who can reframe their credibility so
completely that they can simply tell you
what you're going to do and you go all
right and it feels like Trump has
that like didn't we just go years with
zinsky saying well the one thing I'm
never going to do is seed
territory and then Trump comes in has
one conversation to him and next thing
you know well we're definitely going to
see some territory I mean yeah yeah we
assume that it feels like Trump just
told him what the deal
is I feel like Biden was asking what he
would be willing to do and Trump just
told him what he's going to
do I think that's what it looks like and
that's the Trump
effect
um here's good news there's some gold
based drug that slows tumor growth by
82% um and outperforms
chemotherapy so some Australia
University or
MIT uh and Indian institutions have
unveiled it it's actually gold it's like
the the gold that you would use in a
bracelet or something but they they have
a special process don't put don't eat
any
gold it they do a special process to it
so it's compatible with your
body but if you could reduce it reduce
growth in Animals by
82% wow that's amazing it proved to be
three and a half times more effective
against prostate cancer and S and a half
times more effective against
fibrosarcoma than
chemo wow that's a
lot but we're not done you want want
some more do you have enough good news
yet you want some more this is
recreational good news because we don't
know if it's true but it might
be Story number two also from the
Vigilant Fox um there's some Case Case
series being published in oncology
journal in then oncology Journal that uh
there's an existing drug that's been
around for a while for other purposes
uh originally to design to treat worms
and parasites in animals and you're
going to say to me oh you're talking
about ion but I'm not so this is not
ivin it's called Fen
bendol and there are three cases of
cancer par patients who are basically at
the the end of all their options and
they were ready to go and they had Fen
Bendel and um substantially loaded the
cancer now they might they might already
have it but looks like the tumors were
disappearing with this existing drug
fend Fen
bendol how about that
huh what if it
works do you think that the uh do you
think that the golden age is ready for
this do you think that the golden age is
going to allow an existing
obviously fairly safe drug that's just a
pill to replace chemo that chews you up
and radiation that chews you up and you
could just take a pill and your cancer
will stop
growing what do you
think
well I think someday you might find
out um Trump says he wants to Gaz the
ceasefire before his inauguration
uh axios is reporting this now of course
he does of course he does um now it's
one of Biden's top priorities Biden also
wanted to get it before he left but I
think Trump wants it too because it's
going to look like Trump had something
to do with it even if he
didn't
um yes Dr mer
exactly
anyway we'll see if that happens I and
again I think there's going to be I
think there's going to be the deal of
the centy I think Gaza is going to be
part of it um here is news to just make
you
tingle all right if this doesn't make
you
happy I don't know what will you know
everybody's trying to say how could the
Democrats come back because they don't
they don't seem to have a strong bench
and they seem to be completely broken
and you know overtaken by wokeness and
and uh then you had the problem of uh
commer is raising a billion dollars and
wasting it and now people wonder if
Democrats can even get funding in the
future because it was such a a stain on
the Democrat brand I don't know if it's
going to be limited to KL Harris because
there were a lot of lot of people
working in that combell Harris domain
and they're all kind of guilty of the
spending so here's the fun part you
ready for this one I I I love this story
so much just so much I hope you it as
much as I do according to Newsweek James
Carville has called for an audit of
Harris's campaign
spending all of
it just let let let that sink in for a
minute James Carville who by the way you
know sometimes I have fun with him
because he's an interesting
character but he isn't
dumb he's not dumb and if the Dem R said
listen to him from the
start you might have a president
Harris and I wondered is there any way
to fix this thing you know the Democrat
machine it's just so
broken and then I see that James
Carville is calling for an audit of the
entire Harris campign
spending that mother I won't say it that
magnificent
bastard he found a way out
the the the Democrats were like in an
escape room you know one of those
professional Escape rooms where you go
in and you can't get out and you know if
you're lucky there's somebody Smart in
the room with you and they can figure
out the one way you can get out of the
room this was it this was the only way
out now I don't know if he can get it
done but if he gets this done and it
allows them to send a bunch of Democrats
to jail and also to clean up their
funding
process at the same
time it's going to look like a win to
me and it might be the thing that
rejuvenates the Democrats I mean they'd
have to go through a period of intense
pain because literally people would
probably go to
jail but uh this is this is the this is
a prominent
Democrat looking
inward he's looking for the problem
because
unlike whoever I was talking about
earlier who couldn't find the problem
because she kept looking outside of
herself he's looking inside of himself
in this case inside the campaign and
saying let's look here
first let let's let's leave the
Republicans alone for a minute let's
give them a minute let's look at
ourselves for a minute and look at the
money and by the way following the money
is the smartest hardest
sharpest strategic thing you could do
yeah you got to follow the money because
I think the Democrats are aware that
they're a complete corrupt
organization and I think the corruption
in the campaign was probably
massive it could be one reason it was
less effective is that they were just
buying off people and you know like the
the whole Al Sharpton thing where he
took half a million dollars for his
charity just before he gave an interview
for for
MSNBC there might have been a lot of
that and I would be surprised if they
don't find that there are people
siphoning off massive amounts of the of
the
donations so yes James Carville you have
redeemed yourself because I believe you
found the only way out I don't know if
they're going to take it because there
might be too much pain involved but you
showed them the door that was your job
your job was to show them the door
that's your door if you don't walk
through that and clean up the funding
nothing else you do matters
and I actually like I would like a
country where we've got a fair contest
with the two sides I'm a little
concerned honestly that the Democrats
have destroyed themselves a little too
much I I'd rather have a fair fight just
so you know Republicans stay battle
strong and and and they're not
suggesting things that are just
crazy anyway meanwhile if the fun is not
over yet did you know according to Zero
Hedge Trump might um tap Christopher
rufo to help deify the Ivy Leagues that
receive uh Federal funding now you know
Christopher rufo has been real big in
the Dei push back trying to get rid of
it has been super successful uh a number
of areas in that and uh he may be tapped
to help rooted out at the college level
and I hope later at the federal level
anybody who gets Federal funding should
probably be in the same boat
and I've got to take a little bit of a
Victory
lap now the victory is not mine I just
happen to benefit from it I am so glad I
lived long enough to see this story
Trump Taps Christ rufo to help deify the
ivy League's receiving Federal
funding most of you know this story
but I got to tell it
again and I'm going to
swear because it requires a a curse
word so if you don't like that this
would be a good time to turn it
off so we'll give you a minute to turn
it off if you don't like a swear word
but boy does just need
one I've been waiting 30
years to see this I have been
discriminated against for my race and my
gender for 30 years and I'm
tired of it this is everything I wanted
this is everything I wanted this is why
I risked everything this is what I
 wanted this is what I was
willing to die for now if you didn't
know it when my my first job was for
Crocker Bank in in California and one
day my boss called me into her office
and said we can't promote you maybe ever
because you're white and your mail and
we're way behind on our diversity and I
said well how long is this going to last
and they couldn't tell me so I quit and
I went to work for Pacific Bell got a
raise worked out
well and I got on the fast track at
Pacific Bell to be one of the one of the
executives in
training and one day my boss called me
in his office and said um just got the
word we can't promote you not you
specifically but we can't promote white
men um and I said how long's that going
to last and they couldn't tell
me and that's when I started
Dilbert so I started doing Dilbert on
the side because I knew that I couldn't
succeed in Corporate America because of
my race and my gender now I've told this
story a number of times and there are a
number of black Americans who mean well
and I think they really just want to
know what the truth is and they doubt
that this ever happened and they
question whether I was a capable
employee and maybe they were just firing
me and I made up a story now you
 I was a top rated employee I
was on the I was on the list to be in
Senior Management in both companies I
was finishing my MBA and I was
the most qualified person in every group
that I worked at eventually at least
within my domain no it was purely
discrimination and they told me directly
and they told me often it wasn't like
one
conversation and and even I was in the
room when we would discuss hiring and we
eliminated white people from the
conversation so I saw it both in the
room outside the room I saw it to me and
I couldn't talk about it for about 20
years if I talked about it I knew I
would just be called a racist
ironically and so I waited
and
uh yes prison prisoner Island might be a
good analogy to
this now Trump's in
office and Christopher
rufo with his citar and his
skills will be taken on the Dei stuff
directly and I couldn't be happier
I've waited so long I've waited so long
this is total payback for
me this is everything I want and I want
it for you too I mean I don't want it
just for me I want I want the country to
go back to
Merit to become sane again obviously the
Science Now shows that Dei is more bad
than good so the science is on the uh on
the side of getting rid of it
but man
um and you know later the Dilbert TV
show on UPN uh it got cancelled because
it lost its time slot because they
decided Monday night would be an all
black um night of comedy and since
Dilbert was not a black content they
moved me to a night where it died now if
you don't know the TV business if
something successful in one time slot
and you move it usually dies so that's
what happened to me
um and then of course you're probably
aware that if I were black I never would
have been cancelled for anything I said
in public you all know that right if I
were black I'd still be in every
newspaper in the country every every one
of you knows that right so this thing
this racial discrimination and also
gender has followed me every step of my
entire career and now that I'm you know
sort of at the end of my career to to
have the just the
gift the gift to see that this is going
to be
reversed that's as good as it
gets it's as good as it gets so I'm
having a happy day I hope the rest of
you have a great day I'm going to go
talk to the uh people on locals
