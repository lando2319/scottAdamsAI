come on
come on in it's time oh yeah
come on in and enjoy the
majesty that is coffee with scott adams
yeah a lot of people saying there's no
evidence
that there's such a thing as coffee with
scott adams
it's a baseless claim no evidence
whatsoever
but despite that shall we enjoy it
to its maximum extent with a copper mug
or a glass a tanker challenger steiner
can't a jugger flask a vessel
of any kind it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the conspiracy theory that's true
it's called the simultaneous step but it
happens that go
well you know they told us that
things might not be as interesting
in a in a biden administration and while
we do not have yet to abide in
administration
i feel as if the boring came early if
you know what i mean
you know i didn't realize the extent at
which our entire
entertainment in the united states had
turned into just watching trump say
provocative things
we didn't have sports tv was mostly
repeats
you couldn't go to the gym all we had
the only entertainment we had was trump
saying provocative things and if he
stopped saying it or they stop reporting
it
what do we have what are we left with
what's left
that's what i say
well there's a claim in the ap
that is pretty interesting so
the claim and they're fact checking this
claim
and they say the claim is that the
anti-parasitic drug
ivermectin quote has a miraculous
effectiveness that obliterates
unquote the transmission of covet 19
and will prevent some people from
getting sick so that's the claim that
this ivermectin really works well with
coving but doesn't
but does it here's what the ap assesses
false false they say there's no
evidence ivermectin has been proven a
safe or effective treatment no evidence
no evidence people this was in an
article
showing all the evidence
what is wrong with the news
it was literally a story about a group
of doctors
who came to talk to the to uh was it the
senate
to present the fact that there's a lot
of evidence
that was the context the entire context
of the story that the ap
was talking about and characterized as
quote no evidence
was a story about all the evidence
except they left out all the evidence
they just said it wasn't there
but the whole reason those doctors were
even talking in public
is because they were the experts who had
compiled
a whole bunch of data sometimes called
evidence
that it works now does it work i'm not
saying it works
because i'm not a doctor and even the
doctors
who are saying it's worth a look are
also saying
that it has not reached the you know the
perfect standard of
of proof that you would like with you
know the best kind of
large-scale you know randomized
controlled studies
so nobody is claiming that that's
happened
but they they are claiming that there's
a mountain of evidence
that suggests it probably does work
according to these doctors
and the ap fact checks the doctors
as not having evidence now they could
say the evidence is not conclusive they
could say
evidence is not proof they could say the
evidence is controversial
they could say people haven't quite
studied all the evidence they could say
we need to learn a lot more but one
thing that is 100
obviously false based on their own
article
i'm not even looking at other sources
i'm looking at the ap's own article
completely false
that there's no evidence and
we've gotten to the point where the
media
can present lots of evidence as not
existing
and they can present non-existent
evidence
as having plenty of evidence they
actually can't tell the difference
between lots of evidence and no
evidence now if i were to describe to
you a news industry and you'd never
heard of anything called the news
and suppose i were pitching this to you
and i said you know i've got an idea
we should we should create an industry
called the news and then you say what's
that
i've never heard of this thing called
news yeah
this is an industry where various
companies would compete with each other
to get the best information that's
useful and valuable to the public
and then they would report on that
and then people would make decisions
based on that and and then then you'd
say
well that might be useful an industry
that gives us
valuable information about the world
that we can act on yeah that's good
and i say there's only one problem and i
feel like i have to tell you this in
advance
it will be an industry that is supposed
to tell people
what's happening but if i'm going to be
perfectly honest they do have a little
bit of a
blind spot and you say well how bad
could it be
how bad is the the blind spot and you
say well
some people are making a big deal about
it but ah let's just say
the news industry that i'm suggesting we
create
you wouldn't be able to tell the
difference
between having no evidence of a thing
and having a mountain of evidence for a
thing
and then you would say i'm a little
confused
what does the news do then if it can't
tell the difference between something
which
has a mountain of evidence for it and
something that doesn't have any just no
evidence
it actually can't tell the difference
and and you might say
that doesn't even sound like an industry
that has any purpose
and i say to you just give it a try yeah
let's give it a try i talk you into it
and the next thing you know this news
industry that
you funded and i created is reporting
that there is a
ton of evidence for russia
collusion i mean i tell you
there is so much evidence for russia
collusion
it's everywhere example
did you know that there was a member of
the president's
campaign who was convicted of something
completely unrelated to russia collusion
well that's proof of russia collusion
isn't it
if somebody gets convicted of something
that has nothing to do with russia
collusion
ipso facto qed plenty of russia
collusion
i don't think i need to make my case any
stronger than that
somebody went to jail for unrelated
charges proof
and then what about all the proof that
trump's a racist well you've got the
fine people hoax
they literally can't tell the difference
between lots of evidence
and none hunter biden
no evidence before the election no
evidence baseless after the election
well there's quite a few investigations
going on
uh seems that um
and let me tell you how this was
reported by
uh nbc news
so joe koncha tweeted this and the first
time i read it
i had to read it two or three times to
make sure it wasn't a parody
but i think this actually happened in
the real world
that what i'm going to describe actually
happened
the nbd nbc news said
that the probe was revealed talk about
the probe into hunter biden
the probe was revealed weeks after an
election
in which trump and his allies made
unfounded and baseless claims of
corruption
regarding hunter biden and his father
so weeks after these reported
unfounded and baseless claims
that they're still calling unfounded and
baseless claims right in front of you
i'm not interpreting them they are
saying in their own words
unfounded and baseless claims in the
same story
that they're reporting all the claims
that appear to have a pretty strong base
now what is happening
what is happening
are we being gaslighted it doesn't even
feel like gas lighting
because even gas lighting would have at
least
some sense to it right it would be a
plan
you'd you know at least that would make
sense if somebody was gasoline if
somebody were gaslighting you
so they couldn't tell election uh
and about election fraud the news can't
tell the difference between
a thousand affidavit affidavits
according to rudy giuliani
a thousand individual eyewitness reports
the news calls unfounded baseless
there's no evidence
nothing there russia collusion plenty of
evidence all over the place you're
swimming in it
look at the evidence there's some
evidence on your face wash it off
get that evidence off you i i can't even
get away from all the evidence
of russia collusion but hunter biden
i don't even know what you're talking
about who says there's evidence about
hunter biden doing anything wrong
where'd that come from weird
so you know one of my favorite
favorite quotes from mark twain
is that people can't tell the difference
between good news and bad news
now the first time you hear that twain
quote
that people can't tell the difference
between good news and bad news you say
to yourself
well that might be funny but obviously
we can tell the difference between good
news and bad news
except that we can't
we really can't mark twain wasn't
joking i mean it's funny but he wasn't
joking
we actually literally 100 percent
can't tell good news from bad news
we don't have that ability how's that
how's that for a
punch in the nads you can't tell good
news from bad news
but you also can't tell apparently if
you work for the media
you can't tell the difference between a
pile of
enormous amount of evidence might not
all pan out you know some of it might
not
be right but there's a lot of it
versus haven't seen any
it's all the same
and now we know that there's a subpoena
seeking documents
from hunter biden that covers more than
two dozen entities
and we're told by people who are smart
that
the fact that he's being uh he's being
investigated for
tax related things does not mean
that his only problems are tax related
apparently the way the news
not so not the news apparently the way
the legal system
cleverly works is if they suspect you
have
problems across a number of entities and
maybe
maybe you've got some sketchy business
going on
if you can also make it a tax case
the tax case allows you to open up all
their financial records
once you've opened up their financial
records with the tax case
then any other crimes would become
transparent
so it's the any other crimes that they
might be looking for
but there there's a little diversion
right now because it looks like a tax
case but it might be just to get to the
get to the good stuff we'll see
so but the public isn't any better than
the press
all right if you think that the press
has a problem with the truth the public
is telling me that there's this thing
called the great reset
now i i don't know how to talk about
this without looking like a jerk i just
don't know how to do it
so if if i seem like i'm being a jerk in
the next few moments
more than usual right i suppose it's all
relative
but if i seem like slightly more of a
jerk
than normal it's because this great
reset thing
is the most ridiculous uh idea in the
news
now i don't want to be the one who says
there's no evidence
because there are things such as what uh
justin trudeau using the word reset
so i will say yes there is evidence of
people using the word
there's lots of that if you want to find
evidence
there's a lot there's a lot of evidence
that people have used the phrase
and there's a guy named claus schwab
who's mentioned it
the fact that there's a few people who
think it's a good idea
is a long way from it being a global
conspiracy
right now there are certainly people who
want certain things that's
true but the great reset
who's in charge of it who's in charge of
the great reset
and somebody said there's a document and
they were going to send it to me i'm
seeing it in the comments
what about the documents scott somebody
should send me the documents
because there's plenty of evidence so
just send me the document
i'm sure it's on the internet why don't
you send me a link to all the documents
of the
great reset the great reset is one of
those things that you don't have to
wonder if it's fake
because it's so obviously fake let me
tell you why the great reset
is fake people from different countries
don't coordinate
that way there's no such thing as
something that's going to be you know
great for one country uh and
just them and everybody's on board
the the idea that people from all
different countries
the elites i guess are coordinating to
do something which is good for them
personally
but not good for the countries that they
live in is so ridiculous
and so not understanding how humans work
there are not a whole bunch of people
selling out their own country
for this great reset that's not a thing
all right
there there is however or there are
lots of things you don't like and lots
of trends that you think are going in
the wrong direction
so there's lots of stuff you don't like
and lots of it moving the wrong way
but that's really different from a great
reset that's some kind of weird plan so
the
great reset i will say with complete
confidence
is not real so the vaccines are ready to
ship
and i saw a suggestion that joe biden
should be
the first or among the first to take the
vaccination
in public so the idea is that biden can
help confidence in the vaccinations by
showing us that he's taking one
right in public and that would be good
there's one problem
i have one problem with the idea of joe
biden going first does anybody
somebody says i'm scared
does anybody see a problem with
joe biden going first to get the shot
any problem with that
well there's a statistical risk involved
and it goes like this if you were going
to select
anybody in the public eye who has
a pretty good chance i wouldn't say it's
it's not over 10
but a healthy non-zero
chance of dying for ordinary causes in
the next two weeks
somebody who's 78 would be
on my list so
this is unlikely to happen but it could
happen
obviously i hope it doesn't but if
you're
taking as your standard for health a 78
year old
man you kind of have to hope
that he stays alive on his own for a few
weeks
after he gets the shot because we have a
non-zero
chance of the following thing happening
joe biden gets the shot on television
and within 24 hours he has a heart
attack and dies
unrelated to the vaccination personally
i think the vaccinations will be safe
enough
so i don't want to talk anybody out of
any vaccinations
i do expect i'll get one so you know
your decision may be different
but it has to be said he's 78 years old
and there is some chance he's going to
die from natural causes
having nothing to do with the
vaccination within two weeks of getting
the shot
what's that going to do to your pandemic
yeah if you give it to a 78 year old and
he dies in two weeks
we're in big trouble big trouble
now the other question is who gets it
first kamala harris or joe biden
i have this image in my head of harris
and biden both going to get the shot
and joe biden goes first because he's
the president and
he gets the shot and you know they're
rubbing it and uh you know he's putting
his shirt on and then
it's time for kamala to get her shot and
she's like
oh one thing
i i wish i could
but maybe we could just postpone my shot
what time is it holy cow i
i've got a thing ah i'll
i'll be back i'll totally be back
and get my vaccination after joe biden
did
i'm coming back not right away
i'm a little bit busy but i'll be back
so i'd look out for that
it looks like according to the polls the
election in georgia is within the margin
of stealing
it's within the margin of stealing so i
think we can already know how that's
going to go
if something is close enough to steal
and it's in georgia what do you think
will happen
now if the election was pretty far apart
according to the polls
i would say to you well it looks like
whoever is way ahead is going to win
but if it's within a few percentage if
it's really close
and it's within the margin of stealing
what do you think is going to happen and
why wouldn't it happen really
what name anything that would stop the
democrats from stealing the election
what would it be what would be any kind
of
a force or counterforce or
protective system what would be the
the people or the computers or the
fences
describe for me what would prevent
georgia from cheating in this election
i'm not saying they will i'm asking you
to describe
anything that would prevent it from
happening is it
all of the good witnessing is is because
there are witnesses who can see all the
parts
is that what would prevent it because
don't we know that it won't be witnessed
is it because
somebody has access to the computer code
should i think that there would be
voting
computers involved right are we sure
that it would be a good election
because we have access to the code
and we can watch the code and we would
know if any there was any any mischief
i don't think so so if we don't have
access
to the systems the computers
and we don't have visibility in the
physical ballot
counting area what would stop fraud
is it is it because so many people went
to jail
in pennsylvania i don't remember that
happening
so it's not because people would be
afraid of being
caught if allegedly they believe it
happened somewhere else and people got
away with it
because even if it never happened
anywhere else people in georgia think it
did
right there would be plenty of people in
georgia who believe
that other states had massive fraud and
completely got away with it
even if they didn't there plenty of
people believe it the polls say that
even a lot of democrats believe the
election was stolen
so there are lots of people who believe
that fraud works
because they think it worked in the
presidential election
name any counterforce that you could
think of
that would stop georgia from stealing
the election i can't think of one
i mean seriously i can't think of one
it's not going to be witnessed
we're not going to look at the code and
everybody involved
believes that it worked the last time
they tried it
there's nothing absolutely
nothing between somebody wanting to
steal the election and
succeeding there's there's no friction
there
it's a wide open road now
if the republicans win
maybe maybe we found a way collectively
to witness it better i don't know i'd be
surprised
i don't see how it could happen frankly
so we're our new national sport as you
know
is the proud voice proud boys versus
antifa
have you noticed that black lives matter
has gotten a little bit quiet
black lives matter seems to be quiet
it's almost as if
whoever was backing black lives matter
didn't need to back them after
the election was over so
it's uh down to proud boys versus antifa
and every time the proud boys uh form
any kind of an event as they did in
washington dc
um antifa will show up and then you've
got a
proper sport you've got two teams
they've got names they've got uniforms
they meet in a certain field
they fight it out just like a sport
there are injuries
just like sport so last night for
example
there were four stabbed and 23 arrested
that's the headline four were stabbed
now
let me say this again this was proud
boys
versus antifa and four people were
stabbed
were these stabbers antifa
or were the stabbers proud boys
who do you think was doing the stabbing
and who do you think
got stabbed well i've seen a lot of
footage of the proud boys and i've seen
a lot of footage of antifa
have you ever seen the proud boys bring
knives
is there any do you have any experience
any report
have you ever heard of the proud boys
bringing knives
because i feel as if that's not really a
thing is it
you know people tend to be consistent
and the proud boys seem to be about
you know clubs and and fists
the proud boys don't seem to be bringing
guns and using them i'm sure some of
them are strapped but they don't seem to
be using guns
i've never seen a proud boy holding a
knife
have you i'm not saying they don't own
knives of course they do
but i feel as if this headline
is again trying to convince you that
maybe there were
bad people on both sides
because i feel as if there is some
possibility
a non-zero possibility because the news
is a little unspecific
there's a non-specific or the non-zero
possibility
that all of the stabbing was anti-foss
stabbing
proud boys maybe i'm not saying that was
the case
but don't you think that the reporting
is lacking a little transparency
cause if you had to bet put your own
money on it
if you had to bet who was doing the
stabbing would anybody bet the proud
boys were the stabbers
because it's just not it's not their
game
they they're just not stabbers unless
they decided to be last night for the
first time
i feel like this is clear disinformation
in which they're trying to create a
picture
like there were bad people on both sides
i'll bet
that the proud boys probably didn't
start the trouble
and probably didn't do the stabbing but
i'll bet they
responded aggressively which is of
course why they were there
but here's what i say when a bunch of
people
meet in washington dc and four people
get stabbed
it's the first thing that happened in
washington dc this week that wasn't
pointless that's it
yeah if you've got a stabbing at least
it's not
pointless um today
we heard the tragedy that uh trail
blazing
country music star charlie pride
died from coronavirus complications he
was 86
now i told you early on in the pandemic
that i wouldn't personally worry
until a celebrity under the age of 65
died of coronavirus because that's the
category i'm in
this is irrational by the way don't
don't be like me
but irrationally i was saying i'm not
going to get worried
until i hear at least one celebrity
because that would be my category under
65
who died of the coronavirus still none
still none so he was 86 but he's the
first one
i believe charlie pride is the first
celebrity that i've heard of there's
been a few that
have you know done some work that i
haven't heard of but he's the first one
i've heard of
so it's coming it's coming at me
apparently trump would not say if he
would he would attend
biden's inauguration i would recommend
that he do not
on behalf of uh someone who supported
him
and and does support him still on behalf
of
uh myself and if anybody wants to join
me in this i would say
please don't i i would feel uh
it would be more respectful to not go
now the exception would be
um herman cain wasn't under 65
somebody's saying herman cain um and i
don't i don't consider him a celebrity
per say he was a business person that
happened to be famous
i guess that's a celebrity so
i think that trump should not attend the
biden inauguration unless
biden apologizes for the fine people
hoax because on behalf of the
president's supporters
i would not want him to be anywhere near
somebody who had done something
that bad to his supporters
i don't think trump should be anywhere
near joe biden by joe biden is a very
very bad man or he has
dementia because of the fine people hoax
all right um
i also recommending and i tweeted this
that uh there should be a pardon for
lil wayne so lil wayne the famous rapper
looks like he could go to jail for up to
10 years
for weapons possession because he had a
prior
felony conviction now here's the thing
you you have to know
there was no victim in at least the
the case of little wayne having a gun in
his possession trying to get on an
airplane i think
and the the crime is simply that he
can't own a gun because he has a
prior felony conviction so there was no
altercation
nobody was threatened there was no
victim it is
simply a crime now how many of you think
that lil wayne
was likely to use his weapon to commit a
crime
i feel as if the only reason somebody
like lil wayne would have a weapon
is because he felt he needed it for
self-defense
have you ever seen a cleaner case for a
presidential pardon
now on top of the fact that there was no
victim
and it's sort of absurd to think that
even had the gun for
bad intention almost certainly
almost certainly i would bet without
even knowing anything about the case
i would bet the reason he owned it was
for self-defense
and he probably had a legitimate reason
for self-defense
i'll bet that was real now he also had
said some
uh either good things or at least he
would not say bad things about trump
so lil wayne was one of these people who
got pulled into sort of the kanye
conversation of
hey why are you not saying bad things
about trump when everybody else is
and lil wayne to his credit
decided that he would side with his uh
his customers
and as he pointed out when he looks into
his audience he sees a bunch of
customers that many of whom could be
trump supporters
and so he wasn't going to be anti-trump
now i believe that in the united states
once you become identified as a trump
supporter
you can't get a fair trial what do you
say
do you think in our current environment
you could get a fair trial
for any crime if you had already been
identified as a trump
supporter i don't think so
i think that that level of prejudice at
least in 2020
is so extreme that you could not
guarantee that lil wayne got a fair
a fair hearing right
so i would say that uh president trump
should
pardon lil wayne and this would be just
the easiest cleanest
smartest pardon because you know the
president still is always suffering
under this
the allegations of of racism and there
is
some number of black rappers
you could pardon because i don't think
he's the only
rapper who's in prison at the moment
right
it seems to me that every few weeks you
hear about some rapper going to prison
for one thing or another i think trump
should just release all the rappers
before he goes which would be hilarious
but
it would be hard to explain his legacy
just like what it would do to his legacy
yes yes he was
accused of being this major racist for
four years
and then he released all the rappers the
black rappers before he left
i don't think he's going to do that but
it would so
mess with the legacy and he could just
do it by saying look i think they were
unfairly treated that's the end of the
story i'm just parting them all
it would be kind of awesome actually
but at the very least i think the little
wayne pardon is
is an easy one i think that one's easy
even if he's just doing it to make a
point
that the discrimination against trump
supporters is so extreme
it doesn't really mean that lil wayne
was necessarily disadvantaged by that
but it would be a fun a fun pardon
if you will and there was no victim so i
don't have a problem with it
sky news is reporting some some kind of
major
leak some kind of hack in which
nearly two million uh members of chinese
communist party
uh were identified as being uh
essentially placed around the world in
important positions
so allegedly there are two million or so
chinese i wouldn't call them spies
but they're part of the communi the
chinese communist party
and they appear to be part of a major
program
to get enough chinese communist party
people
placed in big corporations and
governments around not governments but
around the world
to influence things
and now we know who they are and we know
the extent of it almost 2 million
you know how many uh how many spies does
china have
and i thought this is really kind of a
brilliant
strategy in the long run right if you
had if you have the most
people you know china has the biggest
population
and you have enough money why wouldn't
you embark on a hundred year plan
because it might take a long time but a
hundred year plan to get your people
in important positions all around the
world
until china just runs the world
through just having more people and
putting them in the right places
and just waiting two million people is a
pretty serious program
i think we should probably look to get
rid of
to eject from this country anybody who
has any connection to the
chinese communist party so now that we
have the names we should certainly
uh immediately get rid of anybody on
that list
um so i i did a uh
a lesson on reframing on the locals
platform so on locals i'm going to be
doing more on persuasion
and success strategies
so that's a subscription platform so for
those who
are on there i did a lesson on reframing
i'll give you another example
uh right now when
when it started to look like trump was
not going to
have a second term i found myself
feeling sad because i thought oh
all of my fun is talking about
trump stuff you know 80 percent of all
my
entertainment was in this one category
and
i thought to myself i'm going to lose my
main entertainment what am i going to do
so that was my first frame so the first
frame was i lost
something it was something important to
me it was built into my lifestyle and i
was i was going to lose it
that was my first thought but i found
that with practice
you can reframe your subjective
experience of life
fairly easily now i'm a trained
hypnotist
and i can tell you that i don't just
program
other people i've spent you know my
whole
life since i learned these skills
working on my own brain
and reprogramming it using the tools
that you learn to program
other people you can just use them on
yourself and so over
decades you know i've i've sort of
programmed and reprogrammed my head so
that i can
change my frame of life or my subjective
subjective impression of life almost
like a light switch
at this point because i've done it so
many times
and so what i did in this case is
instead of being sad that i wouldn't
have as many
trump stories to talk about that are
always interesting
i redefined myself as a critic
of biden and it turns out
that if you spend a week or two as
defining yourself or framing yourself as
a critic
it's way easier and all of the stress
that i would have every morning i would
wake up every morning
and i look at the news and it would be
another story about something that trump
allegedly did but probably didn't
or allegedly said but probably didn't
there would be some fake news story
about trump
that i had to address now i got to tell
you
if you're going to spend a few minutes
trying to debunk something
that the world believes that's hard it's
a lot of work
debunking stuff but simply criticizing
biden
is easy it's simple you know what would
be easier
making a movie like steven spielberg
is it okay finn
wow you're nice thank you for the for
that
uh that gift that was very generous
um so anyway my point is that i've
reframed my situation as a critic
and i have to say in all seriousness my
my tension my uh
a lot of things that were always at uh
let's say predator prey level you know
uh what do you call it a fight or flight
i went from
continuously being in fight or flight
mode
to happily sitting on the bleachers
mocking the athletes who are in the game
because i don't have to be in the game
i can just be on the sidelines and make
fun of people
and i thought that's not bad
i could get used to this so my point is
this if you practice you can learn to
reframe your experience it doesn't
change the
objective reality if there is one but
it might be fun all right i'm gonna
close on one little interesting story
that has nothing to do with anything
okay
no politics here um some years ago
a friend of mine gave me this cool
little gift it's a
it's a i guess you call it an antique
it's a very old
uh ping pong manual and it is so
cool looking you can see it like really
old-timey and the
cover is falling off and i i found it
the other day when i was cleaning up and
i opened it up and
and it's really like old-timey writing
and it's
it's just really fun and
in the let's see in the in the front of
it my friend who gave it to me john
you know he signed it and wrote a little
note in it
to assign so i did not when he gave it
to me years ago
i had not looked at every page of it
because it wasn't really that kind of a
gift it's not something you read
it's more like a cool thing to have
sitting on a table
and just the other day i picked it up
and i was flipping through it
to see if there's just anything
interesting and
several pages in i found this
it's an original autograph by bill
tilden
now if you don't play tennis and you're
not a if you're not a
historian you don't know who bill tilden
is
but not only was he he wrote the
introduction to the book
but he was the uh superstar tennis
player of his time
in 1928 so the autograph has 1928 in and
so it turns out that i have an original
autograph
from bill tilden from 1928 who would
have been
basically the michael jordan of tennis
when tennis was new and it was
sort of a big deal back then so that was
like a that was the coolest little uh
discovery an actual bill tilden
autograph
from 1928 now only those
those of you who have ever heard of him
would be impressed by this
but this is really cool really cool i
didn't know that was there until i just
saw it
so i don't know that it has any uh
financial value but
in terms of its uh coolness factor it
just went through the roof
all right that's all i have for now and
uh
yeah you can't tell a book from it by
its cover it's lit it's literally i've
got
scotch tape holding it together all
right that's all for now and i'll talk
to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers um
the golden age of sport didn't end well
for tilden i don't know how tilden
uh ended did tilden have a bad end
he's not around anymore uh are you aware
that youtube is over
monetizing you what does that mean over
monetizing me
uh i'm not aware that youtube is over
monetizing me does that mean they're
they're putting too many commercials on
there or something
i don't know what that means um
or you have a fake it could be a fake
autograph anything's possible
all right go watch uh snark warts i
don't know what that is
tons of commercials let me check the
settings you know i've had the problem
before
that youtube uh it feels like it changes
its
its monetization settings or
somehow i change it without knowing that
i even was messing with them
so i've seen that change a few times
without me doing anything i'll go check
that
but if what you're talking about is the
number of commercials
i might have some control over that and
i will
talk to you tomorrow
