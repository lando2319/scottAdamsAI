well stocks are a little bit uh little
bit flat a little bit up not bad we'll
take
it it's the Golden
Age let's see we've got nine people on
YouTube and 223 on
Rumble that's a way to
rumble all right let me get my comments
up here and then we got a show to
do comments
coming
Perfecto good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization but if you'd like to take
this experience which is already wildly
amazing up to levels that nobody can
even understand with tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a cup or
a mug or a glass a tanker CH or sign a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine here of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go well I can't begin to tell you how d
distracting the memes were when I was
doing
that you you can keep doing distracting
memes when I do the the Sip but some of
the some of them were extra distracting
today what's happening with Hawk Nome
he's leading the murderer chance against
Perry of course he is a piece of of
course he
is walk new him I once thought he was he
had potential to be a positive force in
the world but apparently not well let's
start with the golden age you want to
hear the good news you probably already
heard this but drinking coffee is good
for your liver according to noridge I
don't know if these are different
stories or the same story dressed up but
I feel like that's the third time I've
told you that coffee is good for your
liver which is why I soak my liver in
coffee
overnight um also caffeine seems to
block some kind of doping dopamine
effect when you drink alcohol meaning
that if you were to drink a cup of
coffee and then have some alcohol the
alcohol would be less
fun isn't that weird back when I when I
used to drink on
weekends I was sort of a party
Drinker um I would notice that sometimes
I would drink and I didn't feel anything
much and other times I'd have one step
and I'd be like wow and I always
wondered what was behind that like is it
because it it wasn't always because I
hadn't eaten it wasn't food and I always
drank exactly the same thing you know it
was never different so I wonder now I
wonder if it's how how recently I'd had
coffee coffee as you say it maybe if I'd
had a afternoon coffee and then I had an
early evening drink that maybe one
canceled out the other or dehydrated
somebody says dehydration maybe well
anyway coffee seems to decrease the
dopamine hit you get from
alcohol in another study where they just
could have asked me probably they found
that high blood sugar in healthy adults
is linked to lower brain activity in
other words sugar makes you dumb even if
you don't have diabetes so if your sugar
is high just higher than it should be
but not diabetes it's going to take a
few points off your IQ now did all of
you know
that because I feel like I've known that
for a long time that Sugar even if
you're not diabetic extra sugar makes
you extra
zombie didn't you all know that I kind
of thought that was common knowledge but
there's a study if you believe
studies well there's uh the there's an
FTC commissioner according to reclaim
the net FTC commissioner Andrew
Ferguson um he's warned against what he
calls Pro censorship advertising cartels
in other words when the
advertising um groups and entities of
the World when they coordinate to let's
say put X out of business because they
don't like the politics or the messaging
that he's thinking maybe that should be
uh illegal
um what part of illegal would that be I
guess it would be for being a cartel and
and suppressing competition and free
speech so I don't know exactly what
count you would get them on but yes this
is exactly what we
need we need our
FTC to say that you can't put somebody
on a
business with their advertising model
just because you don't like their
editorial thing now I always thought it
would be a big advantage to the
advertising companies if all the
advertising was blind meaning that
nobody could nobody could select what
advertising is associated with their uh
content wouldn't it be better because
once you got used to it and you knew uh
oh here's that terrible
advertisement but it's associated with
this content I want to see but you would
know that the person who made the
content had nothing to do with the
advertising it was just unreal Rel ated
coincidence I I feel like we'd be better
off if you couldn't control
that but you know you'd have to get rid
the the Nazi stuff I suppose but you
know if it's just normal advertising it
seems like you should be blind I'm
seeing a lot of people disagree with
that and so you shall apparently we can
agree to
disagree all right I got something
you're really going to disagree with
later wait for that um according to news
Ray Lewis says 21 Soros linked
Das have been
replaced by tough on crime prosecutor
since 2022 and my first question was if
21 Soros linked Das Soros linked means
he probably was a big part of their
funding for their campaign may have even
selected them um how many are
left you know I always tell you if you
know the number without the percentage
or the percentage without the number you
don't actually know anything
so this is where I don't actually know
anything is
21 most of
them or is 21 just the start so this is
either really really good
news or it's almost
nothing does anybody know what it
is I I think it's a lot of
them yeah I I think it might be the
majority of them and some were replaced
by Soft un crime just other
uh non Soros people but they might be
equally soft on crime so I don't have a
good picture of this but I know that our
the the Soros linked da in my area got
replaced Pam price I think was her name
so I'm happy about that all right that
seems like a move in the right direction
according to
hoodline article by Sandra herandez
there's some kind of a genetic booster
Gene that has been found that might make
your plants grow way faster like double
twice as fast or twice as big and uh
it's not it's not fully realized yet but
they've got a pretty good idea that they
can make your plants twice as good and
the question that this asks for me is
well of course people re reject anything
that looks like it's unnatural so you
got that problem but at what point could
you make indoor farming economical
if you could make a plant grow really
fast and really thick and have you know
lots of food in it and taste good and
all that does that make indoor farming
like if you doubled if you doubled the
amount of food you could produce in the
same
pot I feel like that gets pretty close
to making indoor farming work
economically so maybe that's the big
story who knows meanwhile in Battery
Technology there's something called a
proton
battery so according to the University
of New South Wales I guess they're
working on this and uh I don't know how
you how you store a proton and turn it
into electricity but uh the idea is that
lithium is not the ideal battery type
for the big industrial Network kind of
batteries might work great in your car
and in your drone the lithium batteries
but if you want to have a big one that's
for your whole network to provide
electricity to
buildings then you uh might not want
lithium and so some of these other
storage uh Technologies might be the way
to go so maybe there'll be a protein
battery in your network coming
up um so I guess Biden is doing all this
uh Trump proofing of government trying
to spend all their money and and tie
Trump up in ways that he can't reverse
it when he gets in there and one of the
things is um he granted protection and
secured permanent Tor for 42,000 Social
Security
bureaucrats uh until after Trump leaves
office now what would be the possible
reason for even doing
that I mean the the
Ridiculousness of trying to stop the
people who just want want to get rid of
the unnecessary fat in the
process how is that even a Republican or
a Democrat
issue you you can't let people even look
to get rid of the unnecessary people I
mean
Biden to say that he's the worst
president it just feels like an
understatement he doesn't seem like he's
even on our
side does he he opened the borders
that's not my team he bankrupted the
country with his spending that's not my
team and now he's going to let he's not
going to let uh the Doge effort fire
people who probably need to get fired
that's not on my team started a war with
Ukraine for what reasons is that on my
team like I'm not even seeing Biden
doing things that appear to be in
America's best interest it's just weird
how how amazingly bad he is however
my guess is that there will still be
ways to get rid of those 42,000
people one way would be to turn off
their connection to the
network do you think they can do that ju
just turn off their connection to the
network and then fire them for not doing
their
work so they can't fire them for not
coming into the office but they can
certainly fire them for not doing their
job
right and I mean did Biden say no matter
what you do you can't get
fired well he didn't say that did he so
all you have to do is turn off their
access to the uh internal systems just
block their things unless they come into
work and none of them could do their
work and then you fire them so so I feel
like there's a work around
there just when you think human beings
are as bad as they can possibly
be uh the steam Network that's where
video games are put on that Network to
be downloaded and played
steam uh now there's a video game on
there where you can reenact October 7th
Massacre and apparently you can be on
the side of the massacre people so you
can play Hamas and Massacre innocent
people that's a video game that was made
in the real
world this is actual real thing
yikes now on one hand I say the same
thing that most of you are saying which
is yikes how in the world is that legal
and who would want to do that and blah
blah blah but it it raises a bigger
question can you make imagination
illegal because playing the game is sort
of an imaginary
process um suppose you had virtual
reality that allowed you to do things
that would be
illegal um as a regular person but it
would be fantasy within the virtual
reality such as uh murdering citizens
You could argue that the Hamas thing was
in the context of a you know a larger
war or something but suppose you had a
video game that allowed you just to
murder innocent
people should that be
illegal H um How about if it were
something that allowed you to engage in
what looked like virtual sex
crimes but nobody's involved except you
and your imagination should that be
legal well there's certainly a
commercial element to it which is are
people get to boycott steam because it's
on there and all that but I don't know
if you should ever make anything that's
in your
imagination even if the imagination is
aided by some you know virtual process
as long as is
private I I think I'm in favor of making
sure that nobody can mess with your
imagination I don't know that imagining
these things make you more likely to do
them it might you know if you're if
you're uh let's say already have a
propensity to violence I could see if
you played video games with violence
every
day it might push you over the edge the
average person isn't going to become
violent from a video game we know that
for for sure CU you know too many people
have played video
games um so here here's another
that I need to get rid of all right so
here here's what you should never say
Matt Scott has no idea about steam if
the game is still there in 20 hour 24
hours I'll be amazed now I've used steam
I've downloaded games from it and I do
understand that it's a commercial
process so anybody in the world
understands that if it's still there in
24 hours it would be pretty surprising
so you for assuming that I don't
know something as obvious as that and
then making a comment in public about it
so how about less reading of minds and
less insulting me and maybe have an
opinion that's worth a
 so how about
that all
right this probably it's probably the
same same troll that I got rid of
yesterday I've noticed that there are
some people who would not consider
themselves trolls who can nonetheless
find the most toxic thing to say on
every topic and I don't even know if
they're doing it
intentionally I think they are but yeah
you be a little less toxic it might be
good for
you there are now mysterious car-sized
drones over New Jersey for multiple days
I guess several weeks drone swarms not
just single drones but swarms they say
over the Skies of New Jersey um can I
show you a picture of it would you like
to see a uh a picture of it okay here
you go there you go see that picture you
got it very clear you can clearly see
the drones and you can tell the drones
because you can so clearly see inside
them and you can see that there's no
pilot and you can tell the size of them
very easily no you can't see anything
the pictures are dots they're dots
against the night
sky so I think it's kind of obvious what
they
are they're not
drones duh they're winged uh um bigfoots
I think because you know the bigfoots
are hard to
photograph and if they've been there for
weeks and nobody's got a good photograph
of
them I'm thinking Bigfoot but they're
flying so I'm going to go with the
obvious a winged uh sort of a tribe of
winged
bigfoots
possibly uh no I'm going to make a
better guess here's my better guess why
are we saying that they're they're pilot
they're unpiloted
so we can't get a picture of them but we
know there's not a human being in each
one of
them can you explain that I can it's
because we talk about drones so much
that if you see something in the sky
that you don't recognize it's either a
UFO or a
drone wouldn't it make more sense if it
were let's say a car sized uh
helicopter wouldn't it make more sense
if they were testing a oneperson
military flying
device which would be pretty awesome and
wouldn't know about it if it was
military and it seems to be only in the
proximity of a military
base do you think that our US military
would allow something that they didn't
control to be flying over their base
every night for weeks and that there
would be no explody things happening
like shooting them down or or at least
telling us what's going on I think the
fact that is near something that looks
like a military base and it's a car siiz
thing kind of
suggests I mean it might be drones but I
imagine there's people in them and I
think they're probably just experimental
crafts just guessing it's also possible
that the whole they're the size of a car
is probably just not true because nobody
got a good picture of it you can't
really judge the size of it and
everything's misleading in
space or it's winged
bigfoots according to unusual whales the
account on X uh Google has now been
ordered to uh sell its Chrome
browser and uh share data and search
results with competitors and make a
range of other measures to end its
Monopoly on searching the
Internet isn't it weird that Google lost
its Monopoly on search at the same time
its search feature became kind of
worthless is that a coincidence like at
the same time I decided there's so many
sponsored and fake news and and the news
is just so
obviously you know
propagandized that I just stop using it
I I just use
perplexity or or an AI if I think it's
not going to hallucinate but perplexity
doesn't
do nearly the things that Google
does
so kind kind of a weird coincidence that
just when it wasn't really a
product that's the first time it became
illegal
weird well tragically the CEO of United
Healthcare uh walked downside in uh
Midtown today just maybe an hour ago and
was murdered downside of the Hilton
Hotel and I believe the murderer was
apparently waiting for him so it was a
planned attack it was an assassination
not a random thing and he apparently did
die he was shot multiple M times and the
attacker escaped on a
bicycle yeah so
uh all
right maybe we need a little less of
this in the comments to
Goot maybe a little less of that
okay you know what I'm talking
about just a little less of
that all right well the Daniel peny um
trial is still on I I guess the uh
there's no verdict yet right has any ver
verdict been announced in the Daniel
peny thing because it's going on right
now the ver the verdict veric izing the
uh
deliberations okay well here's the only
hint we have um apparently the one of
the jurors asked for let's just say the
juros asked for
um they wanted a little more information
they wanted a second read through of
what is considered
justifiable so they need a better
definition of what is
justifiable now if you knew that a jury
of 12 people were
asking for a better definition of the
most important part of the trial was it
justifiable doesn't that tell tell
you that there's a reasonable
doubt how in the world could you go
through the entire trial and you're
sitting there trying to decide whether
this guy goes to prison and you can't
decide the 12 of you can't decide on the
same definition of the word that is the
most important word to the
trial I feel like that's somebody who's
who's trying to hang the
jury in other words I feel like
somebody's stalling
it feels like a play by a
patriot as in somebody's going to make
sure that there's something they can
hold on to to claim reasonable doubt I'm
going to say hung
jury what do you say because I think the
people who want to con convict him are
never going to change their mind because
they' just be racists and the people who
think that the jury itself is racist are
not going to change their mind because
it's obviously a racist case
so I think that nobody's you might you
might find people who are willing to be
flexible on the argument of whether
somebody did a crime I don't think
you're going to be find uh I don't think
you're going to find flexibility on
whether to be a racist or
not the people who are racists are going
to be racist and that's going to be
their vote they're going to vote against
him because he's white and those of you
who those in the trial who recognize it
as a racial prosecution are going to say
I don't even care if he did that I don't
even care if he did murder him if it's a
racist prosecution nope that's what I
would do I wouldn't even care about the
details of the case if I knew it was
only only being only a case because of
the race of the uh
alleged not good enough yeah yeah I I
wouldn't participate that in any
way so I can't say it's I don't I don't
have a prediction yet but I would say
the fact that they asked for this
specific thing suggests a hung hung jury
to come so that's I guess that is my
prediction hung jury means that they
could do it again so it might not be
over we'll
see uh meanwhile Democrat New York city
mayor Eric Adams according to the Daily
wire um is totally on Daniel Penny's
side okay
thank you Eric Adams he said quote you
have someone on that Subway who is
responding doing what we should have
done perfect way to put it doing what we
should have
done strongly defended
him you know I don't know if Eric Adams
is angling for some kind of a federal
pardon but he's definitely on my good
side so he agrees with uh homman
about helping to remove you know the
dangerous uh migrants and he agrees that
we should be able to protect ourselves
in his
City now he's got some he's got some
allegations against them that look
pretty serious to me look pretty serious
but God I'd hate to lose him I mean he's
the only Democrat who seems to be
willing to say what is obvious and makes
sense as opposed is just you know team
play but the allegations pretty serious
sounding so we'll see what happens with
that but I I definitely appreciate it
mayor Adams no
relation meanwhile Southwest Airlines
has said it's going to end its Dei
Employment
Practices another one checked off so
good work all
activists um I don't know if that was
just Robbie Starbuck or Christopher rufo
or everybody I'm not sure how many
people were in on that case but uh
another one
Falls um California
lawmaker uh introduced the most
ridiculous bill I think I've heard in a
long time he wants to give admission
priority to it's in the form of
reparations he wants to give admission
priority to the descendants of slaves at
the University of California and
California state
University so he wants to make a
change to give admission priority to
descendants of slaves in
California
uh um can I weigh in here on minute uh I
have a just a slight context to
note uh that has been the current
situation for every year I've lived in
California my entire adult life
there has never been a single second
when a California college did not
overtly
prefer black
candidates they always have whe whether
you're descended from a slave or or
not what what are they talking about
have I been hallucinating the last 30
years of my life that a black candidate
who qualifies has the right
qualifications is largely guaranteed to
get into any College in California let
me say that again a black candidate who
has you know good credentials did well
on tests Etc can get into every College
in California this is the current
situation and has been for decades do we
really need a
bill now maybe maybe it's a push back
against the anti- Dei stuff because the
you know Trump might do away with that
stuff so if it's
if that's what it is then it makes a
little more sense but I think you should
be noted that this is the current
situation and has been for
decades well meanwhile uh district
attorney fonnie Willis some call her
Fanny um has to release all of her
Communications with special counsel Jack
Smith and the January 6 committee Alx is
talking about this on on the
xplatform and and uh the thinking is if
we find out that Fanny fonnie Willis has
been coordinating with them it would
look more like a
RICO you know coordinated lawfare
situation than if she were just doing
her own job and uh unconnected to
anybody at a federal level what do you
think we're going to find do you think
that funny was dumb
enough to do something that would be
coordinated with the Feds that she would
have to know could be discoverable at
some point for some reason do you think
any of that would be in
writing I feel like the only thing that
might be in writing would be something
like hey can we have lunch or can do you
have a minute to talk or something like
that I feel like they would be too smart
to put
anything especially a
lawyer if you're an attorney if you're a
district
attorney don't you know not to put any
illegal stuff in your messages
that's just sort of you know district
attorney 101 stuff so I don't know that
we'll find anything but I'm glad they're
looking
um I I love the fact that
MSNBC has now completely transformed
from being what we thought was a News
Network that you know we just made us
mad because it didn't agree with us all
the time uh to nothing but comedy so
every single day now I go into and I
look at the clips where somebody on
MSNBC is acting
stupid and it's always funny so today's
stupidity uh there's a compilation by
graban g r a b i n I always see their
compilations and I just want to give
them a shout out so somebody graian or
graban um so I wish I could give them a
better plug because they do good work uh
some of the best compilation clips that
are funny come with this label on it um
but in
2019 MSNBC there's a the the compilation
is they're talking about
whistleblowers and and it sounds like
this I'm making this up it's like
whistleblowers are the heroes of the
country oh those whistleblowers thank
goodness for the brave brave
whistleblowers who are taking a risk to
help the country it's part of
democracy that was 2019 that's when the
whistleblowers are saying things they
want them to
say what do they call the
whistleblowers when the whistleblowers
are opposite their interests and
whistleblowing on things that are on
their
team well I've told you that MSNBC is
not just humorous it's theater and the I
swear they all act like they're they're
professional actors or actresses in the
play you know how a play is always
always
overacted like a movie could be
sometimes subtle because the camera can
get right in there but what if you're in
a
play sometimes you you go big and it's
just a little bit more
theatrical that that's what MSNBC did
with the whistleblowers so as soon as
the whistleblowers were not positive for
their narrative they all did the same
thing the the way they talk about it B
and then they've got the
socalled
whistleblowers the the what they're
calling whistleblowers or some people
that some people are saying are
whistleblowers the whistleblowers
so-called all right apparently I don't
do a good imitation so you have to watch
it MSNBC as a a humor source is pretty
rich it looks like clown
college and then of course Scott
Jennings continues to
uh to embarrass his CNN uh co-workers by
simply being a voice of reason and being
you know good at what he does so
Jennings does the uh he's their rare uh
right leaning Republican type of voice
now I give them credit so again I'll go
see an then credit they give a very
capable person who very much disagrees
with their
ists fulltime they don't cut him off
they let him do his thing and I very
much appreciate it because then it turns
CNN into also a comedy show because you
have to watch the reactions of the panel
when Scott Jennings is laying down the
truth and look at all their faces and
they all they all do this kind
of where where where their mouth is kind
of
pinched cuz they're hearing things that
just make them look like idiots but they
don't want to they don't want to break
in yet they're
like
so so to uh today I saw a clip where
Scott used the really
technique now this is one I teach you on
my live streams now he didn't use the
word really but but he uses the same
technique the the technique is this when
somebody makes a claim that is
preposterous rather than going through
all the work of explaining why it's
Preposterous you simply restate it and
you go
really so so that's what you think so
you think that the president of the
United
States with full forethought stood in
front of the American people on video
with millions of witnesses and called
neo-nazis Fine people really really you
think that actually happened
so that that's how really works you
don't have to even make your argument
you just have to say really because it's
embarrassing that anybody would have
that
thought so Scott used that about uh a
different technique he didn't use the
word really but he simply described what
they
believed and made them agree to
it which was devastating he simply
described their own opinion and then
asked them if they're committing to it
and it was it was just marvelous to
watch excellent
technique um so he was talking to
uh somebody who was talking about the uh
the idea of trump wanting to use the
military in the United States so
somebody named mwan said I I don't want
to be bringing back water
boarding what was somebody talking about
that was that on the table was somebody
talking about bringing back water
boarding I uh I don't don't want to be a
country that tortures people especially
for the kind of country that's going to
be using the military against our own
citizens and then Jones says somebody
named Jones says we're talking about the
American people we're talking about
taking up arms against them with the
military that's supposed to be
protecting them this is not
right and so you have to watch this clip
just to see Scott Jenning face where
where they do the the split screen you
can just see him looking at them when
he's saying that they're going to use
the military against our own citizens
and he's like you know that the illegal
migrants are not our own citizens
right it's wonderful it's wonderful good
comedy meanwhile Biden is in
Angola and he he promised to give them a
billion dollars in aid for African
victims of natural
disasters now here's what he says about
you know that's the right thing for the
wealthy EST nation in the world to do
blah blah blah um Mr
Biden I don't know how to explain this
to
you Angola has a much higher net worth
than the United
States like a lot like it's not even
close the United States is 35 36
trillion doll in
debt Angola probably also has some debt
if few billion few billion in debt so
which country is worth more the one that
owes a few billion more than it has or
the one that owns 36 trillion more than
it has Angola is richer than the United
States and that's not a joke they're far
richer they just you know it's in a
different form but no we don't have
money to give them we literally have no
money all we did is is uh move forward
by a few minutes the time that we're
completely bankrupt we didn't give them
many money we gave them some debt or
something or we created some debt
to to replace some of their debt I
guess meanwhile terer Carlson's over in
Russia uh doesn't look like he's going
to talk to Putin but maybe he's still
trying but he did interview lavro if you
don't know who lavro is he's the
English-speaking one that you see
whenever something about Russia is going
on so he he's the uh the mouthpiece for
Russia sort of Putin's guy so we haven't
seen that yet but it has been
recorded um again this caused a lot of
people to be talking about World War III
and how close we are to a nuclear
confrontation because Russia's doing
things that look like they're teasing a
nuclear preparation and we're doing
things back that look like you know if
you nuke us we'll nuke you and I remind
you again you've never been
safer you're in the safest moment of all
of American History because waiting for
Trump nobody's going to mess
around nobody's going to mess around
while we got a few weeks before Trump
gets there and just sorts things out now
even if you say B Scot Trump is not a
Superman he can't make everything go
away in a week maybe but at the moment
most people think he
can most reasonable people think he
actually can make most most of our
problems go away in a week I mean he can
make Dei go away in a week right he
could probably get our uh hostage is
released I don't know if he'll do that
but it's within reason that it could
happen within a week and he could
definitely get it least something like a
ceasefire and some talks going with
Ukraine in a week so
if pu if Putin is not
insane then he just Waits a little while
and gets most of or everything he
wants why would he nuke us and why would
we nuke them when if we just wait a few
weeks we'll probably wrap it up and get
at least some of what we
want so I remind you it always looks the
darkest before the dawn as they say and
I get I get all the things you're seeing
all the all the scary very saber
rattling but that's just what happens
before you do the serious peace talks so
we have never ever been safer from an
intentional nuclear war an accidental
one I don't know you maybe there's
something that makes that a little more
likely but yeah no we're we're nowhere
near any kind of nuclear war you can
stop worrying about that you you have
like a million things that are a bigger
problem than that that's not the one you
need to worry about I promise
you that you will not be nuked between
now and January
20th I don't know about after that but
you're good for
now well let's talk about the nominees
so Pete heg Seth of course said uh 10
Anonymous people say that they think he
drinks too much and has some bad
behaviors but they were all Anonymous
huh
but then I've never seen any one person
have more
supporters weigh in with their
name pretty
much I don't know if it's all of them
but a whole bunch of people who worked
with him every day like actually sat on
the couch next to him in in his segments
you know worked just the two of them for
you know years sometimes uh everyone who
weighed in with their name said these
stories are complet complete
he's totally professional he has never
smelled of alcohol never looked like
he's had alcohol during the job uh
everybody agrees he's had some he's had
some uh some drinks at
night he he he's had some fun maybe more
fun than he wanted to have but not a
single one of his co-workers who know
him really really well for years not one
of
them uh who who gives her name says that
any of this is
real and there
are so let let me uh let me give you a
strong opinion on
this yesterday I was saying hm how do
you weigh you know uh 10 or so
Anonymous accusations if there were only
one Anonymous accusation I'd rule it
down completely
if there are 10 you have to at least
treat it a little bit
seriously but once you have 10 people
who are in exactly the right place to
observe this behavior and they say
clearly and unambiguously and strongly
absolute 100%
 I think I I think I'm going to
go with the Fox News
co-workers so you know I don't know him
so I don't have any personal experience
but I would say if given given the names
and the reputations of the people who
backed them I think I'm going to go with
them now I don't I can't know everything
so I don't know what's true but if I had
to choose in terms of credibility the
the Fox News people who went on the
record strongly you know including
banino you know ex Fox News person um I
feel like I trust
them so I'm going to say that uh that
that should not be the reason that that
he might not get
it however there are several Senators
who have not committed Senator Susan
Collins Lisa marowski John Curtis
Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and John
th does that group of people worry you
at all is there anything about that
group of people that that they have in
common because Lindsey Graham Mitch
McConnell
onun I don't know I feel like maybe
they're trying to protect the defense
people more than they're looking to
reform
things so I don't trust those
Senators um and I don't
trust uh Anonymous
sources but I do trust the people who
from Fox News and the people who worked
with them including a producer who had
tons of exposure and are putting their
names they're putting their own rep
reputations on the line for another
person that's a it's pretty gutsy thing
to do so I'm going to go with the
guts I'm going to go with the brave
people of Fox News who said I'm going to
put M I'm going to put my reputation in
the line and I'm GNA back this guy
because he's been solid the whole time
I've known
him so can't know for sure that's where
I think it's going however of course
there's some worry within the campaign
not campaign but within the future Trump
Administration and uh according to just
the news and also
CNN people are saying that uh Ronda
Sis's name has been raised as maybe a
safer easier nominee for Secretary of
Defense um and other names are floating
are Bill Hagerty
Senator and somebody
else um maybe somebody
else here's my
take um Ronda
santis have you notice that he is he
seems uh he seems capable for almost
every
job have you noticed that with when he
was running for president I remember
thinking well I prefer Trump but you
know clearly DeSantis is
qualified uh when we talk about you know
being a a senator or something of course
of course if we talk about him to be the
Secretary of
Defense yeah we talk about him if if he
had been nominated for attorney
general yeah yeah how about uh if he had
been nominated to be the head of the
FBI yeah yeah I I mean I I think I have
to give a shout out to
DeSantis for his talent stack because
he's got the military he's got the legal
and now he has the the management of
being a governor and succeeded on all
fronts he basically succeeded in
everything he touched and they were the
exact right things to touch so he's got
a hell of a good package there so I
don't know if if he became the
nominee um I don't think we'd be moving
backwards maybe Florida would but I
don't think I don't think the nominee
would be
worse but also think uh P Heth uh I like
his dedication to getting rid of Dei and
I think that's really important but I
think Dan santis would do it
too meanwhile uh it looks like
California is finally
settled all its uh voting stuff and uh
four weeks after the election there's
another result which oh oh guess what it
was too close to call but they counted
until all five of the ones who were too
close to call went Democrat now the last
one just went Democrat huh five out of
five now what are the odds that there
would be five
races when when the entire House of
Representatives is so close so close and
all five races the ones that took a long
time all five went in the same
direction
huh um I'm going to call it rigged
so let me explain this again uh do I do
I know for sure that that was rigged no
is there a court case that suggests that
anything here was rigged no is it likely
that there will be a court case that
proves anything was rigged no I mean
because the court case probably won't
happen um here's why I say it's
rigged if you act exactly like it's
rigged I get to say it's rigged those
are the rules I'm sorry those are the
rules if you do everything to make it
look rigged I get to say well that looks
rigged to me and I'm going to treat it
that way so that looks rigged to me so
I'm going to treat it this way if you
can't count the votes in a month
don't expect me to believe the result
when it goes coincidentally
coincidentally like the whistleblowers
coincidentally All in One Direction no
rigged rigged and I'm
sorry that that has to be a firm and um
undeniable opinion the truth of it don't
know but I know if you act like you're
rigging it and you're acting exactly
like you're rigging it and everything
you do looks like it's rigging it I get
to call it
rigged there's there's not going to be a
debate on that because I get to call it
what I get to call it and you gave me
every reason to call it rigged so I call
it
rigged that's my that's my take do I
know no don't need to it's as bad as if
it had been rigged even if it
wasn't because we can't live like this
we can't have races that we don't know
who
won
um all right here's the part where
you're not going to like me um I know
that almost all of you like cash Patel
as a nominee for FBI part of why you
like him is that he's tough and he's
experienced and you and he's loyal to
Trump and you know he's going to go
after the worst of the bad guys I like
all of that he's definitely smart enough
uh and he has all the right you know his
brain is in the right direction and
everything but did you know mediate Med
mediaite which is not a reput
entity but they've got uh 60 people that
apparently are on cash Patel's enemies
list and I think some of them are some
or most of them are listed in the
appendix of one of his
books
now I'll just read you some of the names
so these are the ones that cash Patel
thinks needs to be investigated because
there's enough evidence that they've
done some bad stuff all right uh some
these you don't know but Lloyd Austin
James Baker Bill bar John Bolton Joe
Biden John Brennan um
Eric
charmella Pat seone James
Clapper Hillary Clinton James Comey I'm
skipping some names that may be less
familiar to you uh Mark esper Alyssa
Farah um Merrick
Garland Stephanie Grisham K Harris Gina
haspel former
CIA um Eric
Holder Cassidy Hutchins Nina
jankowitz Loretta
Lynch uh there's some general General
Kenneth McKenzie Andrew
McCabe man it's a long list I'm skipping
a lot all right uh Ryan
McCarthy uh General Millie Robert
Muller Bruce or nellor Lisa Page you
remember these names from um
from Russia
collusion um John
podesta Susan Rice Rod Rosenstein Peter
stro Jake
suvan uh Andrew
Weissman Alexander vinman Christopher
Ray Sally Yates Adam Schiff
now I think every person whose name I
read feels like a little bit Shifty to
me
but I told you that I'm not going to
tolerate
lawfare I mean what can I do about it
it's not it's not like I have anything
to do about it but I don't have to be in
favor of it um I'm not
comfortable I'm not comfortable with the
head of the FBI having an enemy
list nope now if he'd kept this to
himself and shared it with the president
and said you know if you nominate me I
get a long list here and going after
them that that'd be fine I'd actually be
fine with that but they better find real
crimes I am not fine with somebody who
has an enemies list that doesn't come
paired with what they did
wrong if if this is a real list and and
by the way the first thing you need to
know is that this is from mediaite it's
not from him but they say it comes from
sources from cash so I'll take a I'll
take a fact check on that if if I got
any of the fact facts wrong let me know
but do you want somebody to come in to
be the head of the FBI who has a list of
people that he's going
after you okay with that I'm going to
say no I'm going to say no on that and
by the way I do think that most of the
people that I read have a lot to
explain but you're going to have to come
up with a lot more of a a lot more of a
crime before I'm okay
putting their names out there and saying
that you know they had the FBI is going
to go after
them do I believe that he's done his
homework and he has reason to believe
that each of them have something to
explain yes probably I think he probably
did his homework but this is not the way
to present it to the public the public
can't see a list of people first because
that looks like Stalin show me the list
of people oh it's all your enemies is
that Quin incidence I'll bet we can find
a crime that all of my enemies did nope
not
cool so I I'm going to I'm going to keep
my opinion open for a while open meaning
I'm not I'm not closing
down the idea of supporting cash for
that job I'm not not closing it down I'm
saying that I need to know more about
this if in his book these are the same
names in the book I don't know if this
is true but if the book has say a
paragraph on each one and a specific
list of crimes that you know are
somewhat publicly obviously
true well then okay then it's then it's
not really like an enemies list
it's it's a description of the
situation so I'll wait for that because
I don't trust
mediaite to just show me the names and
have the right names and that he
necessarily agrees with all the names
so I'm uh I'm undecided on cash Patel no
it doesn't matter because they're not
going to make the decision based on what
I think
but I think all of you guys need to have
the same
standard I think the standard needs to
be that you need to know what the crime
is first and then give me the name but
if you give me the name first and I
haven't seen the crime yet I got
questions for
you before I have questions for the
person you're naming cuz you're doing
something that bothers me and I know
you're doing something that I don't like
I don't know about that person you're
talking about I'll listen to it I'm open
to the argument and and and I want to
say again there are people on that list
that he's targeted that I really think
do need to get
targeted some of them but I don't know
the whole story Beyond most of them so
no lawfare please that would be my
take uh you heard that there was a a
little disruption in South
Korea here's what's funny about South
Korea I always feel like South Korea is
held up as an example of a highly
functioning democracy and with a really
real good free market and their economy
is
amazing and so therefore their
government must be pretty good otherwise
they they couldn't be up functioning so
well
well so their current president declared
martial
law um but
the I guess the parliament tried to get
in the building to vote it down of voted
out the military tried to stop them from
getting in but they climbed over the
fence and got in and quickly voted on it
and now the president is obligated to
remove it because they voted on it and
the the military has decided to say all
right we're
out we're out you voted on it you said
you said it's the end so the military
apparently uh get some credit for not
only keeping some kind of stability but
when there was a a democratic process
even though they tried to stop it um it
looks like they're just obeying orders
at this point and trying to do the right
thing but here's what I didn't know and
I saw this list from a few different
accounts in Direction Barbie had it some
others here are some of the past
presidents of South Korea now I won't
mention all their names because you've
never heard of them so there are 13 of
them and all I'm going to tell you is
what happened to them all right so the
first one singman re he was
overthrown the next one was overthrown
then the next one was assassinated and
I'll just go down the list removed by
military coup senten death after his
presidency sentenced to 22 years 22
years in prison after his presidency
imprisoned during the term of president
number three um convictions blah blah
blah imprisoned under President number
three and sentenced to death under
President number five later pardoned and
winning a Nobel
Prize impeached later overturned
investigated for corruption committed
suicide arrested for corruption
sentenced to 50 years impeached and
arrested for corruption sentenced to 24
years recent president no oh not bad so
Moon Jen recent president no
imprisonment well good for you and then
uh yunu Yol must be the new one the
current one impeachment
likely now look at look at the state of
their government which looks like a hot
mess and always has been and somehow
they're rocking the best economy short
of what Japan or something I mean the
the stability of
their society and uh their lifestyle and
everything how in the world does that
any of that work with when their
government is such a hot mess maybe it
tells us the government is not part of
the
solution anyway um I saw a clip on this
you know we all know that Bernie got
cheated by Hill Hillary Clinton when he
was he was running for
2016 but did you know that uh Bernie won
every County in West Virginia and the
and he won every
County and then West Virginia went to
Hillary did you know that let me say
that again it's a fact that nobody
disputes so that there's no
dispute that West
Virginia 100% of the counties voted for
Bernie
um but the super delegates decided they
just give it to Hillary Clinton
instead that that's the actual real
thing that happened while we were all
watching now the rules allow that
because they have these things called
super delegates that can just overrule
the regular people but if you have super
delegates then the actual primary is
just for show because the super
delegates will decide who the the
candidate is so I wouldn't call the
Democrat Party a Democratic party the
Democrats are more like
a I don't know some kind of
a uh I'd call them sort of a face for
some large entities that need the
government to do what they want them to
do certainly not Democratic in
nature well if you haven't seen the
entire Mike Ben's appearance on Joe
Rogan I I can't I can't even recommend
it high
enough because a lot of the bad things
that are happening that you don't
understand is it because they're HED in
complexity the complexity of all the
different funded organizations and how
they're related and who's on what and
who told who to do what and what they
want out of it and all that it's
amazingly
complicated but Ben has that exact kind
of brain where he can dig into it and
explain it to you and when he does your
head will just
explode and by the way I don't think
there's anything that Mike Ben presents
that isn't documented in other words
he'll he'll show you the official
government document he'll show you their
budget you'll show you their mission
statement he'll show you a video of them
talking it's all none of is made up but
the the basic idea is that the US always
has been
um well at least in modern
history we we have apparently learned
that since we have the most money we
don't have to conquer other countries
with our military because that's the the
expensive way to do it if you have
enough money you can just
buy enough support to control any
country if it's smaller than you so it
doesn't work with Russia so that's why
you end up with you know big Ukraine war
but with anybody smaller we can just
bribe them you know blackmail them just
do all the CIA stuff that they do murder
somebody you know that that sort of
thing we can fund the uh the rebels make
sure they have better
weapons um
so I didn't realize that there's a group
called us Aid which is cleverly named so
you think it's something about helping
other countries but the aid has nothing
to do with other countries it's
literally an
enormous uh $50 billion budget situation
for influencing other countries and when
I say influencing I mean
controlling right not I'm not talking
about nudging we're talking about just
outright controlling them
and the entire intelligence communi only
has 72 billion and some people say the
50 billion is understated because there
might be other things that contribute to
what they're doing
so we have this enormous enormous
expense the sort of this black box of
bad behavior this basically a CIA asset
to control other countries and uh I
think a lot of this these tools got
turned back internally because they had
to stop anything that was a populist
movement and when you hear Ben's
described how the idea of
democracy uh changed from being what you
wouldd expect a populist would be you
think Trump is the ultimate democracy
person because he's backed by the most
people and it's what the people want as
opposed to the big moneyed interests and
the elites that's about as Democratic as
you can get people vote for you and you
do stuff for people the Democrats
apparently have redefined democracy as
supporting Democratic
institutions meaning if you if you
complain about uh the the covid shot you
know you're complaining against the
healthc care institutions and that's
anti-democratic so anything you complain
about that's a a function or a
department or any part of our Democratic
process makes you
anti-democratic so when Trump wants to
come in and you know Doge the government
and get rid of stuff he's getting rid of
departments but to Democrats that's the
same as getting rid of democracy because
to the Democrats the democracy is the
big organizations that's what's keeping
things together so I'd never heard
that um framing of it but it's pretty
interesting and uh once you learn that
the entire Ukraine situation is nothing
at all like the news has told you but
rather it was the entire operation was a
way to steal energy um the essentially
the economy of Russia depends on energy
and a lot of it runs through Ukraine so
the idea was this is according to Ben
the idea was that uh Ukraine also has
its own large stores of energy it's like
third biggest or something but it's
unexploited so if we could the west and
the us could control
Ukraine they already have the pipelines
but if you could get them also to
produce the energy then you don't need
Russia so Russia needed the you know the
access and the pipelines in Ukraine and
the US thought H wouldn't it be good if
we had the access in the pipelines so
Europe could get all of its
supplies but wouldn't it be great if the
country that we control like Ukraine was
the one with all the energy so you can
see why Putin's not going to give
up but uh and you can you can see why we
didn't give up because it's a you know
trillion dooll thing and a lot of the
people involved have their beak in it so
people are getting a taste so anytime
you can move a trillion dollars around
you can have all these people who are
figuring I had to carve out their
billion from the trillion and they're
not going to want to stop
it so you should see Ukraine as nothing
but a uh an energy deal for a bunch of
rich people that might get you killed
and got
600,000 um ukrainians killed maybe the
same number of Russians killed and that
the people involved are pretending that
this is about something else you know
National Defense and NATO and all that
but really it's about who gets to
produce the oil and the gas and collect
the
checks and barisma apparently was
key Central to the whole plan of the US
controlling Ukraine and we would and
they would boost barisma to be the main
you know main Energy company that we
would control and that that was why
Hunter was part of it so Hunter then
under this telling would be a an
important part of the cia's
mission and probably there was never any
chance he could have gone to
jail whether Biden had pardoned him or
not if if he was working for the CIA I'm
pretty sure they would have found some
way that he wasn't going to go to jail
because it does look like he was
genuinely working for the CIA now he was
also trying to line his own pockets and
and the CIA probably knew that the uh
the Biden crime family was a perfect fit
for their plans but um yeah I don't
think there was any chance he was ever
going to go to
jail so you have to you just have to
listen to those it's the most
mind-blowing thing you'll
hear um according to the amuse
account on X uh Trump made a big mistake
by agreeing to let the FBI vet his
appointees now vetting means checking
their
background and that does give the FBI
the
ability to say or not say things that
they find which gives the
FBI a lot of control over whether the
nominees go
forward do you think that that feels
comfortable to you the FBI the very
entity that will be most targeted by his
nominees are going to be the ones who
tell you who the nominee can
be
what I don't know how that possibly
works
so I'll keep an eye on that but uh I
agree with the amuse account that that
doesn't look good
um let's
see according to speaking of cash Patel
um he noted on a recent video I saw that
the January 6 committee when they took
his
deposition he put uh five government
reports into his testimony and then when
he saw what they had later they had they
had eliminated them two of the two of
the documents were exonerating would
have EX erated Trump because they
involved mayor Bowser and Pelosi and
what they were saying about the National
Guard and basically you can see that
Trump always wanted the National Guard
Trump always wanted
peace no indication that he wanted
trouble he in fact he wanted the
opposite he wanted peace and he wanted
the to make sure there was enough
security and that Bowser and Pelosi may
have not been on the same
page meaning it was more their fault
than his
and
this is why I think all the January
Sixers need to be pardoned without
regard to how bad their crimes were
because if you don't know that the
government was behind instigating the
trouble and this clearly indicates that
there were two people who could have
could have increased the security to the
point where nobody got hurt or fewer
people got hurt and decided not to for
whatever reason don't know yet uh
presumably to make it look worse for
Trump but we don't know
that
so assuming is true that uh the January
6 committee
intentionally um essentially altered his
testimony by removing big parts of it
that feels jailable doesn't
it I don't know exactly what law that
would be violating
but if somebody testifies under oath in
an official proceeding and then you
decide to hide some of the good stuff
the stuff that would be opposite of your
narrative there must be some law against
that isn't
there so that's that's the sort of thing
where I don't necessarily want to put
the names of the people on a on a hit
list but you certainly start with the
January 6 committee if you're going to
be asking some questions as the new head
of the
FBI all
right um according to uh project Veritas
as I told you you know Biden is trying
to Trump proof the administration but uh
there's some guy who works for for the
EPA and uh project Veritas caught him on
hidden camera and he's saying that
they've got an insurance policy against
Trump and that they're funneling
billions to climate organizations and he
said quote we're throwing gold gold bars
off the
Titanic to get the money out as fast as
possible now do you think that the
reason they're trying to get this money
out as fast as possible especially for
the green initiatives is because they
want to save the planet and they know
they have to hurry and if Trump gets in
there they won't be able to save the
planet I don't think so
there may be some people thinking that
way but no my guess is that when you
have lots of money to throw around that
there are a bunch of Democrats waiting
to get their beak wet and get their cut
and if you don't allocate the money they
won't get their cut so this is
everything about getting the cut and
nothing about the economy so it's
theft Bas not basically it's just theft
it might not be
illegal but I don't see it as anything
both
theft and that ladies and
gentlemen is what I wanted to tell you
