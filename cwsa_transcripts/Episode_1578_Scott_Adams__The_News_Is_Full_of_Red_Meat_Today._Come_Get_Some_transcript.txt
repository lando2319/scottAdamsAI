good morning everybody
and welcome to
one of the best things that will ever
happen to you it's called coffee with
scott adams and it's famous all over the
internet
um and today is likely to be one of the
highlights of all times
yeah that's how good this is going to be
and if you want to take it up another
level you'll need the simultaneous sip
to do that and all you need is a couple
of margarita glasses tanker gel stein a
canteen gentle plastic a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's called
the simultaneous step
and it's going to happen right now go
do you know how hard it is to talk and
read at the same time
this is weird little skill that live
streamers develop
i think the skill of it is you have to
think what you're going to say and then
package it
and then as it's coming out
you can still read it's kind of tough
but you can do it for short periods it's
not really multitasking but it feels
like it
well this is a i'd like to start with a
public service
now this public service will not be
necessary for the men i know a lot of my
audience is male
but this is only for the benefit of your
spouses or significant others who are
female
i'm pretty sure the men are going to
appreciate this okay
because it's something you all have to
deal with
but it goes like this
public service announcement
if you're facing away from me
and mumbling
i probably can't hear you
let me give you an example this would be
facing you
and talking clearly
hello scott
how was your day
see how that well that worked now
imagine that i'm across the room
facing the other way
reading my phone
and saying
now
as a man
you're forced with two choices now
you can say what
do you know what happens when you do
that
does your spouse turn around face you
and speak clearly
i've never had that experience what i
get is
it's sort of still mumbling but it's
more angry
don't ask a third time
just don't ask a third time because
that's when the fight starts that's
that's too many times to ask
instead do what i do
agree
and then later
when she says i told you we were going
to the thing
you need to say oh damn i heard that and
i just forgot
that's your only way to play so as a
public service announcement to the
spouses listening to this
the women
for some reason it just seems to be a
male female thing
we can't hear you if you're facing the
other direction and mumbling
almost never
now i'd like to add to that
if you're standing
next to a source of running water
it could be a sink possibly a shower
could be a bathtub filling up
if you're talking to me from across the
room
even if you're not mumbling especially
and i'm standing next to running water
how often do i hear you
zero
i think it's zero
and what do you do
if somebody talks and you're next to the
water
don't do this
what
because they'll just say it again the
same way and you're still standing next
to the water
yes james you deal with this
every day
and
i promise you this is not this is not me
talking about christina
right this is every man and every woman
and i don't know why it's it's other
female members of a family as well so
it's you know kids grandmothers
but it's it's it's some kind of a weird
gender difference
that i've i don't think a man has ever
done that
but women hear you across the room if
you're facing the other direction and we
never hear you when we're near running
water and that's not going to change
all right uh there's a story about chris
cuomo
helping his brother through his
accusations the brothers accusations of
sexual misconduct
while governor
i can't i can't care about this story
in what world did we expect brothers not
to talk
or not to help each other
or not to advise
or maybe even not to make a phone call
to somebody
of course
of course
this is a story that shouldn't be a
story i mean it's a it's a
it's of interest
but to imagine that chris cuomo should
be fired for giving his brother advice
on anything
i i just can't go there i mean this is
joseph
this is just too political i realize
even you know msnbc
somebody there saying he should be fired
for this
and i don't even have an opinion about
whether he should be fired
i mean that's cnn's problem they can
they can make that decision
but it doesn't bother me at all
are you bothered by it
does anybody here feel that there's some
injustice or something because
he works for cnn and he backed his
brother
who who would be
who would not expect that exactly
you know it's one thing to be surprised
by something that's you know bad
but if you know it's just part of the
texture of life
complaining about it is like complaining
about the rain you know it's just going
to be there so
i don't know this just looks like a
news on the right taking a shot at the
cuomo's and i'm not defending either one
of them
because it's not my problem you know
they have plenty that they need to
defend there i'm just saying i don't
know how i should be mad at this
i can't get i can't get concerned about
that news
all right in other news erasmus says
that
only 26 percent of likely u.s voters
believe biden has done enough to stop
the rising price of gasoline
uh carpe says
the rain should be fired too
you're tough on rain carpe
tough on rain
um have i ever mentioned that 25
of people in every poll are freaking
idiots
just reliably
25 is always going to get it wrong
every question
and so exactly 26
you know the 25 is always approximate
uh
they think maybe biden has done enough
to keep the energy prices down
he literally is raising them
intentionally
he's intentionally reducing the supply
how does 26 percent of the country not
notice that he's not only
not helping
he's trying as hard as he can to make it
go the other way right in front of you
and every news source is reporting it
it's not even one of those things where
you know the left is hiding the news or
anything they're reporting it
and a quarter of the country gets every
question wrong
it's so consistent
all right
i'm going to give you a quick investment
lesson
uh
that's a two-parter it's a
it's also full disclosure all right so i
have some investments in some topics
that i talk about
and so you should know that
um tesla i have an investment in amazon
microsoft
um apple a bunch of tech companies snap
twitter twitter i have an investment in
and i've mentioned those before but i
just made some changes this morning
i'm going to tell you why i made the
changes but also full disclosure so in
case i talk about it
all right here's what i did
i had shares of pen stock the online
gaming
company
and that was because of the bar stool
situation the other stock dropped when
the whole bar stool came out thing came
out and i thought to myself you know
this looks like just
overreaction
and so i bought some on the dip
and then it just kept going down
so in terms of guessing
i guess poorly now here's your first
investment lesson many of you are
experienced investors so you know just
uh
just fact check me as i go if you're an
experienced investor jump in on the
comments if you want to add something to
it because you probably do
never buy an individual stock
and think you're investing
that's the most important tip
if you buy one and only one stock
and you don't have any other investments
you're not investing
that's not an investment that's just a
bet that's just a gamble
right if you don't have a diversified
portfolio where some can go up and some
will go down and you know it kind of
takes care of itself on average if you
don't have that you're not investing
you're just gambling right
so that's the first thing you need to
know when i tell you what individual
stocks i bought
here's what you should know
it's only one of
a larger portfolio and for me it's just
gambling
all right
so that the next stop i tell you about i
would not say is an investment
and specifically i wouldn't advise you
to buy it
right don't do what i did
unless you've done your own you know
looking into it
uh your research is a little bit
worthless but you know at least do your
own don't listen to me
and you have a portfolio that's already
balanced
if that's the case well you might
consider it but i don't recommend it
the stock is
so the stock i got rid of first of all
is regeneron
so regeneron has
been sort of a miracle
drug for quite a while now because it
works
uh but today is also the day that the
the covet pill
gets approved by the fda we think
if covet pills are out
which would you rather take a regeneron
drip
where they have to now give me a fact
check on this that's the only way you
can get regeneron right
regeneron doesn't have a pill does it
um so it's going to get a lot of
competition so whatever form it is it
doesn't matter it's getting competition
so i got rid of regeneron for a profit
it was up
um
but it'll have more competition probably
still a good company still probably
still a good stock
but it didn't have the
the reason that i bought it changed
now here's a here's a warren buffett
investment advice
if you buy a stock
don't sell it
unless the reason you bought it in the
first place changes
so the reason i bought it in the first
place is it was sort of the only game in
town
you know that was that powerful
but now there's competition so so i sold
it so that's that's your investment
lesson something changed
now
uh the other thing i bought was today
just this morning i bought win hotels
now win
w-y-n-n which is
one of the greatest names ever for a
casino
it actually says win right in the name
but obviously it was the founder's name
now the reason that i bought that and
again this is not an investment advice
is i'm betting that the variant news is
overblown
so i'm essentially making a bet that i
understand the media
a little bit better than maybe the
average investor
is that true
i don't know
i don't know i guess we'll find out
because i put my money where my mouth is
now that doesn't mean wind will
necessarily go up or down based on that
variable alone
but it's a good one so it's a solid
company it's the top of the industry
it's the best hotels in vegas vegas is
still doing business
so apparently they're making money even
in the pandemic so it's probably
underpriced now and i bought some of
that but i don't recommend it for you
because it's very very speculative so
don't don't invest in a stock like that
unless you can lose it all and still
sleep
all right china has uh wind has china
exposure but my understanding is that's
priced to zero already
they basically priced
the the china
stuff all the way down to nothing
i'm exaggerating but it's it's priced in
there
so we'll see so i just tell you that uh
so so as you know
uh and i also think that the coveted
pill will make such a big difference
to travel and risk
that it's going to be hard to keep
things locked down when you've got a
covered pill in your pocket
am i right
apparently the covent pill takes the
risk down to pretty close zero
if you take it once you have symptoms
am i right i think that's the case
and when that's the case how does the
government justify keeping stuff closed
down
i feel like the argument is going away
really quickly
all right
apparently in germany
uh if you want to
commit suicide in a legal way which
apparently is legal if it's you know
assisted suicide
sort of medically approved and you've
done all the steps to be approved for
that
you can actually
kill yourself in germany legally
but
only if you're vaccinated first
that's the actual story i'm not even
making that up you have to be fully
vaccinated to kill yourself in germany
now
obviously the reason is because the
medical professionals and others
who might be attending to you
don't want to get infected so it's not
obviously the story is not about the
person who's going to be dead
but it sounds funny when you read it
it's one of those stories that sounds
like ah this is crazy except it's not
yeah you still have to protect the
people around you
if you believe that vaccinations
do that
also greece and germany
are sort of poised to make vaccines
mandatory i think in greece that's
already a done deal
and in germany the incoming chancellor
wants it wants them to be mandatory
at the same time the covet pill is
coming out
so
here's a bad move for a politician
make vaccines mandatory at the same time
the coveted pill comes out
that's pretty bad timing
all right
now the cover pill does not make
vaccinations unnecessary if our experts
are correct in what everything's doing
of course that's a big if
um
but it's but it's good news
so here's my question about germany
in my opinion
this would be a pretty big government
overreach
do you think the german population can
be hitlerized
this easily
still
did they learn nothing from world war ii
because i i feel like that's their main
lesson in life and they're a bit
obsessed about learning something from
it
you may be over obsessed
but
it
this is going to be fun to watch
if the german public just gets in line
it says oh okay
i guess we need our shots now
or do they overthrow the government
i don't know
i'm going to root for the german people
so i'm going to root for the german
people to
change their government's opinion or
at least speak out
unless unless the public actually agrees
with us you know if you did a german
opinion poll and 80 percent of the
public was for it i'd say oh okay do
what you want to do
do what you want to do
all right
um
there is a interesting article in the
blaze by daniel horowitz
who is making some pretty big claims
about vitamin d based on studies so it's
not he's not making stuff up he's
looking at the studies
and apparently the study suggests that
if your vitamin d level is over a
certain
level
your odds of dying are zero
apparently the science seems to suggest
that
yeah over 50 what is the unit
50
what mill or something
what is the units we're talking about
yeah now apparently uh now this is of
course according to daniel horowitz's
article so these are his interpretations
according to him it's the most
documented
scientific truth of the pandemic
that nothing's more documented with more
certainty
than having more vitamin d would keep
you from dying of covet
now do you believe that
i always have the problem that you know
people said that about ivorbectin they
said about hydroxychloroquine
it has been said about many things and
not true
there are many things that look like
they're super well documented by science
but they're not true
all right
um
so i would be concerned about anybody
who says all the science points in one
direction because we've seen that trick
before
but i suspect that all the science does
point one direction
and as i predicted let me take you back
to the beginning of the pandemic
some of you will remember this
and based on pattern recognition alone
before i'd heard it from really anybody
but i think other people were saying it
then i just hadn't heard it from anybody
yet
i said is it a coincidence that it seems
to be
not affecting the places that have the
most vitamin d
does anybody remember me saying that at
the beginning of the pandemic
hey just i'm just looking at where it's
good and where it's bad
it looks like wherever people get enough
vitamin d
including sweden
because they supplement in sweden
including sweden
that they were having better outcomes
and it looked like it was fairly
consistent where there was a lot of smog
it looked like they're having a tough
time and where there wasn't now i don't
know that my pattern recognition was on
point or it could have been an illusion
you know i just convinced myself i saw
something but the science now is
squarely on that side but
here's my caution
according to daniel horowitz article
there's now
some tests
which would suggest is more than just a
correlation
that is causation
i'm not quite there
i want to be there
and if i had to bet
i don't know 50 50
that we'd get there
in 50 50 means i just don't have a basis
for making a prediction basically
i don't know that we're going to prove
its causation
and here's why
everybody who has bad health has low
vitamin d
it could be just an indicator that your
health is bad in general
dr shiva promoted vitamin d first
somebody saying in the comments
i i know he was among the earliest i
don't remember if he said it before i
did but probably
inflammation theory
etc
um
yeah anecdotally people taking
kovid seemed to be uh
doing well
but
here's here's the provocative point that
daniel horowitz makes and i don't
discount this this could actually be
true
that it's the biggest crime in the
history of humanity
that is possible
it is possible that the collective
pharma plus
news industry
may have prevented
an obvious and cheap solution to the
pandemic
may have
and if i had to bet whether this is true
or not
that the the biggest crime in all
humanity
you know i mean you you could argue that
world war ii was bigger
but in terms of you know this kind of
crime that's not actually a war
it would be the biggest crime in human
civilization
and we might be watching it right in
front of us
let her bummer scott is finally waking
up all right you're gone
i don't tolerate scott is finally waking
up when i say things that i literally
was the first person in the
country
that you heard say it
wasn't the first one to say it but
probably the first one you heard for
many of you
all right
so
i would keep an eye on this
because i don't know that the news
business will report on it accurately
i don't know if scientists will report
on inaccurately
um and i don't trust a journalist to
look into the
science and tell me what's happening
so
i just i just put a gigantic question
mark around this and i think that daniel
horowitz's article does a good service
um and i recommend it so go look for
that i tweeted it if you want to find it
that way
all right
there's a article on cnn that about
trump and his intelligence briefings
and of course it's written to make trump
look bad and says stuff like
i guess james clapper
says that trump ignores the facts from
the biggest no you know he ignores the
facts
clapper
clapper
said that trump ignored the facts
are we going to ignore the fact that
clapper is the biggest liar we've ever
known in public life
he's literally a famous liar clappers
i mean well documented you've all seen
the videos of what he said and then
what's true
he's literally a well-documented liar
and he says that trump wouldn't believe
him
or the people like him
thank you
is this supposed to be making me think
less of trump apparently trump
didn't trust that they would even be on
the side of the country
much less trump
now am i supposed to think less of trump
because he had a perfectly accurate view
of the intelligence agency because
that's what it was
trump
smelled it from the first second and he
smelled it correctly
they were in fact trying to overthrow
the government at the very time
that they were giving him briefings they
were trying to overthrow his
administration
and they said despite all of that
apparently he treated all the briefers
and he got briefed a lot
star city will be blocked now scott
stars is like scott just figured
this out
no i didn't just
figure it out goodbye
jesus christ
you idiots
why are there so many idiots today on
youtube
did somebody like did an idiot tweet
this or something so all the idiots come
just don't tell me i'm finally
getting it if it's something i've been
talking about for two years
jesus christ
all right um
sorry about that
all right
uh there's
apparently cnn's going to have to
re-engineer their narrative
if they're trying to make us like trump
less because he didn't trust the people
trying to overthrow his administration
that's a plus
pure plus
and you know you've watched me long
enough i'm not going to say everything
does pure plus
right
uh you know he's got some rough edges we
all acknowledge that but this is pure
plus
thanks tp
yesterday i saw a little uh group of
people talking i figure what is
twitter's product
that's like that
uh the one where you can hear people
talking
so it's like a group talk in people
spaces yeah so twitter's product called
spaces where you can create a little
space where people will talk about a
topic
well you know i wandered into one
yesterday that was about
black issues it was mostly maybe
90 of the attendees were black and the
topic was
issues of black concern
and it was really interesting
yeah it's like clubhouse but it's
twitter's version it was really
interesting to be sort of the fly on the
wall i mean even though
you know my presence was obvious because
my i show up there
but to hear um
to hear people talking to each other
in other words black people talking to
other black people
is different
than what you normally see if you're
just watching tv
because normally you're seeing black
people talking to everybody
and it was kind of an eye-opener
god admit um
and
uh i'll probably get cancelled for what
i'm going to do next so if i get
canceled for this
it was nice knowing you
i enjoyed our time together
but
here's what one of the uh one of the
people talking it doesn't matter which
one was saying because it sounded like
people were generally agreeing with this
they were saying that
white adoptive parents of black babies
are suboptimal
and the reason is that the white
adoptive parents on average
would not and i'm
i'm i'm paraphrasing right these are not
exact quotes and the problem was that a
white adoptive parent
would not teach the black child
that their um
that their
their experience is based on victimhood
basically
that the white parent would not teach
them
that they are being
suppressed and held back by society and
that you know racial injustice
is a big explanation for whatever's
happening to them
now
i only heard agreement
nobody pushed back on that
so that
and i wonder you know of course that
this is anecdotal so i asked myself
would this be a normal conversation
uh would
would your average black american have
this conversation with other black
americans would they talk this way
it's interesting
and now
here's the part where i'll get cancelled
i'm trying to be helpful
probably still get canceled because my
intention doesn't matter right it just
matters what they take out of context
but i'm trying to be helpful
i believe that this point of view is
based on truth
it is true
that if you're black in america you're
going to be discriminated against that's
true
i also buy into
systemic racism as being absolutely true
how could it not be true
how can one group start from
behind and expect to you know catch up i
mean it's definitely a limitation
you know you could argue that other
groups have succeeded better with
similar or bad situations but not really
you know nothing's like slavery um so
so i so i buy into systemic racism as
being real but here's the problem
if you raise the kid with that belief
set you've
you've ruined the kid
it's like child abuse
it doesn't matter that it's true
it absolutely doesn't matter that it's
true
if you teach the kid that their success
will be limited by these things that's
what'll happen that's what that's how
they'll see the world and that's what'll
happen
now
here's where i get canceled
do you think asian americans are doing
that with their kids
do you think jewish americans are
telling their kids
you know you're not going to do so well
in america because of all the
anti-semitism
nope
nope do you think white parents tell
their kids
that they won't do so well because of
what reverse racism or
you know it's tough to be a white person
in america in 2021 even if they believe
it
even if they believe it
you're not going to raise your kids to
believe it
that's child abuse
how does it
and
the fact that it's true
let's take the specific case of black
americans
it's completely true that they'll have
extra
challenges
but man you you raise somebody to
believe that that's like a permanent
obstacle
because that's that's essentially what
what it looks like it looks like it's
some kind of permanent obstacle the way
it's being represented
that is so bad
and it would explain almost entirely the
difference between white and black
performance in the country
if you just took a bunch of anybody
you pick any ethnic group
and then teach their children that they
won't they won't do well because of
discrimination and just watch what
happens
they won't do well
because they'll they'll think that their
failure is caused by somebody else
so why would you fix it you can't
somebody else's problem how do i fix
other people i can fix myself
so i would say that the problem here is
that you have to separate what's true
from what's useful
what's true is it's tough to be black in
america in a variety of ways but it's
also true that there are a bunch of
advantages
if you're not teaching your kid hey this
discrimination stuff is real and it's
going to bite you in the ass every
single day of your life
that's probably true
also true you have a bunch of advantages
the society is engineered in for you
such as getting a job at a fortune 500
company you go to the top of the line so
go there
don't go where things will be bad for
you because you have a choice
go work for the fortune 500 company i
mean assuming you've done your
school work right
so anyway it bothers me to see a
gigantic segment of americans
disadvantaging themselves
because that's what it looks like it's
like self-immolation
and
i
i can't be comfortable with this
so at the risk of getting canceled let
me advise black parents
to tell their kids that they can succeed
they just have to have a better strategy
because they got a little extra
challenge
all right
twitter as a new ceo jack dorsey uh
decided to uh
uh
resign from that position he's got
plenty to do
i believe he's still running square and
he's got a lot of uh
charitable uh
uh challenges at i i think jack wants to
give away much of his uh wealth
and that's sort of a full-time job as
bill gates has discovered
so
i would say number one
the best timing of anybody ever left a
job
this is the best timing that a founder
ever had
twitter stock is good
and the election is coming
and when the election comes i would not
want to be the ceo of twitter
he is going to get so
much
grief
so to the extent that
jack dorsey was thinking of leaving
anyway his timing could not have been
better
now he's replaced with a new ceo is uh
perag
aggro a wall i haven't heard it
pronounced correctly so if i'm
mispronouncing it i apologize
and he's getting some trouble on the
internet today because of a tweet of
course
you know from ten years ago or something
eleven years eleven years ago in which
he was quoting um
asif monvi
uh asaf sf monvi a comedian on the john
stewart show
and so
uh i'll tell you what the
tweet was and then let's talk about it
um
did i actually not write down the tweet
good lord
because somebody put you you all saw the
the news
would you do me a favor and uh type the
tweet into the comments so people can
see it because i'm an idiot i didn't
write down the actual exact tweet
uh it was yeah that i'll paraphrase that
he was saying that if if people can call
muslims
terrorists
then why can't he call white people
racists
now
uh there was a big you know upheaval
about that and
the left is going out of the way to sort
of explain it away
and this is the way they're explaining
the way
they're saying hey that was just sarcasm
and it was a joke
was it sarcasm
was it a joke
now it was based on what what a comedian
said to another comedian
so that much we know
uh
yeah there it is um
so the exact quote was and thank you
they are not going to make a distinction
i don't know what they is i guess white
people they are not going to make a
distinction between muslims and
extremists then why should i distinguish
between white people and
racist now it's in quotes
so you can see that it's not his words
right so he's quoting somebody
and originally was in a humorous context
but
um i don't know if you know this or not
but i wrote i write jokes for a living
i'm
this is one of the few things
in which
i am an expert
believe it or not so we finally found
something i could talk about that i'm an
expert at
it took long enough
but i'm an expert at writing jokes
i've got 33 years of experience at a
commercial level
and this wasn't a joke
this wasn't a joke
where's the punch line
what's the joke
there's no joke
so trying to explain this away as a joke
is ridiculous
it's a point
it's a point it's a provocative point
but he's making a point
and it's a good one
why is he you know why would anybody
even need to apologize for it
it's a perfectly good point
if somebody's going to
paint one group
by their extremists why can't you do the
same with them
perfectly good point
doesn't need to be explained
you don't need to you don't need to
explain it away as as a joke
you don't have to say is satire
obviously it shouldn't be taken
seriously
it was a point
now
it was a good enough point that people
on the right probably looked at and said
oh yeah that's a pretty good point
because if you're on the right you're
generally free in favor of freedom of
speech
this is just freedom of speech
made a point made it provocative
good for him
i have no problem with that at all
except
here's a question
why make that point
of all the points you could make about
all the things in the world
we don't tweet them all
we tweet things that we think are
important
things that in our mind have risen to a
level of oh that's tweetable
so we do know that the new ceo of
twitter
has at least at one point in his life
thought that something important enough
to tweet
was this point
which is a really scary signal
that his opinion of
white people and republicans
specifically
of republicans on twitter
might have some bias in it
would you agree with that
that the joke itself
doesn't really say anything that i have
any problem with but
the things you focus on
can be a signal for what you're thinking
wait a minute who's going to say it
first
who's going to criticize me first remind
me to go ahead you should
you should say ah scott
your mind reading
mind reading
and it would be
so we can't know what was in his mind
but if you're telling me i should ignore
the signal
that this was one of the things he
thought was worthy of tweeting
i can't ignore that
that's a pretty strong signal
but
i also can't read his mind
so the signal could be imaginary
i could just be imagining that he's got
an attitude about republicans
it wouldn't be statistically unlikely
if you just threw a dart into san
francisco or wherever he's working
enough and you hit the first person with
a dart
well there's a pretty good chance that
they don't like republicans
or don't respect them or something
so this is a pretty big signal
that he would be similar to most of the
people in san francisco and have an
attitude about republicans
which is scary if you happen to be a
republican and you happen to use twitter
and you're saying to yourself
someday it's going to be a judgment call
whether i cross the line or not
who do you want making the judgment call
somebody who had never made this tweet
or somebody who made that tweet now of
course the ceo isn't making all the
banning calls
personally
but the big ones
i'll bet the big ones are all run by the
ceo
i'll bet the ceo sees all the the big
blue check ones that they ban
so
that would be something to be afraid of
let's see what daniel dale is saying
uh
[Music]
well i don't know what that's about
i thought that was going to be on this
topic but it was not
uh
oh damn it
lost my whole locals feed
don't know if you guys are still there
somewhere let's see if i can find you
all right
damn it
um
i think it might be live still so let me
see if i can find it
this interface is driving me nuts
god damn it
all right well youtube
um
i'll just take locals off offline
all right locals is offline uh
apparently if i open up
open up a
image and look at it and hit the wrong
button it goes offline
all right
john carl has a book called something
about betrayal it's an anti-trump book
and he did an interview and
cnn's
brian stelter was talking to about it
and jonathan carl said this
about trump how do you cover a candidate
who is running both
is it both against whoever the
democratic candidate is but also running
against the very democratic system
that makes all this possible
in other words there's a journalist who
will be covering trump
uh yeah locals is down i know so i i
just turned off the feed
it's just a
it's an interface bug with locals so i
can't get it back
at least not while i'm doing this
and so jonathan carl is says that he
doesn't know how to cover a candidate
who he believes is running against the
very democratic system that makes all
this possible
what
what
um
how can you possibly be
credible as a journalist if you leave if
you believe that trump was running
against the democratic system
what
now
i assume that he's talking about the
questioning the
elections questioning the elections is
part of the democratic system
protesting
part of the democratic system
disagreeing with your critics
part of the dis part of the system
wanting your elections to be fair and
audited and to make sure that the people
voted for who they thought they voted
for
part of the system part of the
democratic system trump has never even
slightly left
the democratic system not even slightly
he's been he's been one of the most
productive parts of it
he told us the news was fake and finally
sold it to us so that now we know
that's pretty big deal
if you if you want to improve the
democratic system
you have to destroy the fake news and he
did
i don't think anybody's helped the
democratic system more than that do you
seriously
if you just take one variable
trump is the one who told you the news
was fake
in a way that eventually you could see
as well
that is the biggest improvement in
democracy
since the constitution
in my opinion
because if you didn't know the news was
fake
what good is having a democracy
it wouldn't make any difference
right
now did you used to think that the
election system itself
was
fair or fair enough
i bet you did
i'll bet you did
now what do you think
now you think that even if the election
picked the right president
i don't know one way or the other
you do know that this system is flawed
and that we can't live with us
we have a system which is flawed and we
cannot
we cannot live with it
trump made that true as well
now who is more democratic
the person who says we have to fix this
system so we really know who got elected
or the person who says don't fix the
system
even though you can't tell who got
elected for sure
which one is more of more the democrat
or democratic
trump
by far
which which uh president had more uh
gave more access to the press
biden
or trump
trump by far
ten to one right
what does the democratic system need
more than transparency
well it's like one of the top things you
need
you need all kinds of transparency
and trump
gave it to her
so i would say that trump is the biggest
booster of the democratic system
of all time
since the actual creation
of the constitution
those three things are gigantic
i mean even the fact that he tweeted was
more transparency
greatest transparency
greatest amount of energy toward fixing
the voting system itself
and the the person who told us that the
news was ruining democracy basically
you could make an argument that he
should get an award
for boosting the democratic system
and it would be an easy argument
actually a very easy argument you
wouldn't have to stretch it at all
i do know who uh vandalized the house by
the way
um
and uh what's interesting is that
person's uh one one of that person's
parents is probably watching right now
so if you have a child who may or may
not have taken some eggs and had a
reason to throw them at my house
you know who you are
why don't you ask your
child
where they were that night
and what they were doing
because i think you know who it was
we do
all right um
amplifying not boosting okay
i'm just looking at your comments for a
moment
um
i don't think the eggs were about me
um
frank says scott using your skills i
make hundreds of dollars a week being
tick-tock famous good for you
um
so i i tried to buy a
ford
automobile
recently
a month ago or so
and
um i knew it was going to take a few
months for delivery because everything
was backed up
so
i ordered the automobile
and
i didn't hear back and then i followed
up and i said hey is is this really
ordered i'm looking for some kind of
ongoing communication
and instead of saying oh yes that's
ordered
they sent me the order and asked me to
confirm it
and i thought
oh
maybe it was my fault because i was
pretty sure i confirmed it before i left
i mean i looked at it i signed it
confirmed
but
then why did they why were they checking
with me again
like weeks and weeks later
so i thought that was weird and i also
thought it might be a stall
a way to tell me that i'm not getting
that car
and
with that automobile
and
so i followed up
and didn't get a call back
then i followed up again
didn't get a call back
so that's why i tweeted and said
does anybody know if
cars are even available and of course
there's a big microchip problem and that
probably has something to do with it
but here's the thing i actually don't
know if i bought a car
isn't that weird
and i can't find out
now a representative from ford did
contact me uh
to
see if they could work it out but i
don't know if i need to do that because
if they had a car i'm sure they'd want
to sell it to me right
if any car was ordered and coming my way
in any kind of a you know reasonable
time month or two or whatever
i think they'd want me to know that
don't you
am i right
wouldn't they want me to know that
they'd keep in contact hey
you know here's the schedule your car is
at the factory blah blah blah blah
i don't think that they're selling cars
now
i feel like ford is only selling you
promises of cars
i don't know if you could actually buy a
car unless it's on the lot if it's on
the lot yes but if you had to order it i
don't know that they could even tell you
they can get it or when
does anybody else have this experience
so i don't know that there's necessarily
a problem to solve
because if they could solve their supply
chain problem they would have done it
already
now
uh the ford van the ford vapor
i'm actually pro ford i like
you know american company it's a it's a
great american company
um talk about mr science fauci you know
i've i've intentionally ignored that
whole uh
fouchy saying that people are uh
they're going after him because he
represents science
that was just a
person who's not so good with public
relations
trying to handle some public relations
there's not much to that story
yeah trying to uh
cloak himself with the
with a shield of science
that worked when we believe science
but i don't know what is less credible
in 2021. science in general or fouchy's
specifically
so it's sort of like
well they're attacking me but i'm going
to wrap myself in
crap
all right what time is it i'm gonna need
to get going here uh apologize to all
the locals people
uh
there's a there's sort of an interface
imperfection that that caused me to
knock you off today
and
um
yeah i think ford is doing something big
to uh to fix their chip problems
it'll just take a while
all right
um
and vaccines haven't worked
you know that was one of the things that
um
was in the article in in the blaze by uh
was it uh horowitz
um
he he claimed in that article that uh
the the science already shows that none
of the
the masking and vaccines and
shutdowns and stuff didn't make any
difference
i don't believe that
i i don't believe that there's any study
that shows that
all right there are studies that pretend
to show that but i don't think there's a
good study that shows that
are you edging us local speed
watch john campbell review of vitamin d
clinical trials on youtube it's he's pro
vitamin d right
um have they done a trial yet with
vitamin d in which they took a group of
people and they boosted some of their
vitamin d before they were ever infected
and they didn't and they left the rest
alone
has that trial been done in a
randomized controlled trial way
i doubt it because i don't know anybody
who would have the financial somebody
says yes
yes
i don't think so
because i don't know who would fund that
it would it would be really expensive
and i don't know that you know generic
vitamin companies could fund it
observational somebody says yeah i don't
think it's been done so here's what it
would take to
change my well not change my mind to
convince me
that vitamin d supplementation would end
the pandemic
i would need
two places that are kind of similar
and i would need one place that gets no
supplements ahead of time and one that
does
and then i want to see that the ones
that got supplements nobody died
and then the other one they had a normal
normal rate of death what we'd expect
if you give me that with a randomized
controlled trial
of sufficient number of people
i'm in
but short of that i still have a problem
with the causation
i mean it's so close
like i want to believe it
yeah by the way gibraltar has been
debunked
yeah the the countries that we know you
can't learn anything from
uh africa
not you know continent
doesn't tell us anything it's just a
mystery sweden
mystery israel mystery
gibraltar mystery they don't tell you
anything
just tell if florida california compare
anything you want basically we don't
know why stuff's happening
but
if it turns out it's the vitamin d
that would explain everything
that would just explain everything
so the fact that it explains basically
everything
does make me lean toward it
compare north and south
vitamin g yeah
you can't quite do that because of
supplementing a lot of people supplement
vitamin d so i don't know if you can
just compare north and south
um
dr johnson says
here's my my troll uh dr johnson says
you will never find a fat person that is
also tanned from the sun
well
huh
that's not a bad comment
i mean obviously it's it's an absolute
so it doesn't make sense as an absolute
but
it's probably true
that people who are obese spend less
time in a swimsuit
that's probably true
so
wouldn't it be interesting if the weight
was nothing but a signal for vitamin d
and the weight actually had nothing to
do with anything and it was just your
vitamin d levels all along
more skin surface
yeah the bigger you are the more skin
surface you have to absorb vitamin d ah
hey angela says he's never been to the
beach in texas
refuse his claim
all right well on that note
that's funny enough i'm gonna go do
something else sorry to locals for
knocking you off i'll visit you later
today
