again that's good I hope you're doing
well we've got a show for you
today soon as I can see my
comments come on
comments there we go everything's
working out perfectly today
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
guarantee you've never had a better time
in your life but if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
can even understand with their tiny
shiny human
brains all you need for that is a cup or
M Glass a tankered chel Stein a canteen
jug a flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
dope mean hit of the day thing that
makes everything better it's called a
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go well I don't know how your life is
going for the last 24
hours but ever since uh grock got really
really good at making
pictures uh there's been a Non-Stop uh
memes of me dating Michelle
Obama and the the images are so
photorealistic that you know all morning
long and yesterday too I'm looking at
photos going by in the locals that the
people in chat on the locals feed can
put in images so we trade
memes and there are about 10,000 memes
of making it with Michelle Obama but but
here's the funny thing uh they also
tried to do uh AOC and me but every time
they did an AOC picture where where I
was you know on as far as AI I was
seemingly dating
her it didn't look like we had
chemistry like we even though we would
be like in the picture we'd be close but
just didn't look like we were that into
each other but but the funny thing is
the Michelle Obama pictures almost all
of them it looks like we're really
getting it off we're really getting it
off and and it makes me wonder in the
real world it makes me
wonder given that AI is based on pattern
recognition is it possible that AI is
predicting that if I ever met Michelle
Obama in person that we'd get along
great do do you think that that's
possible do you think K could figure out
just with its own little patterned
recognition which kind of people I'd get
along with and who I wouldn't and is it
possible that it knows I wouldn't get
along with AOC and and I'm not talking
about dating I'm just talking about you
know personal Charisma and chemistry and
stuff but it looks like I would be I
would like really get along with
Michelle
Obama and it makes me curious now I
actually really want to meet her just to
see if we would just have like a natural
connection bet we do I don't know if I
had to bet it on I'd say 60 40s that the
AI is actually revealing that there's
some way we'd we'd get along
great anyway there's a one of the top
stories is there's a school shooting and
there's something about maybe trans and
I'm not going to talk about any of that
I don't love talking about the trans
stuff don't love talking about the
crimes and when they're together uh I'm
twice is not twice as
likely to not want
to right I have to I have to show if you
don't mind the people on
locals uh I'm G to I'm going to show
everybody some of the
memes so here's me with Michelle Obama
on a date at the Cat Cafe that doesn't
exist but
should see there we are see how we're
heading it
off see
for some reason it puts like spots on me
all right what else we got
here
um but then notice how I don't have
chemistry with everybody so here I am
with KLA
Harris no
chemistry right you can see it there's
just no chemistry there all right now
let's
see find another one with Michelle
bunch of them coming in just as I was
talking about
it all right here's another one at the
Cat
Cafe you tell
me are are we not having a good
time we we're pet and the cat we're
drinking coffee these are good
times I'm going to have a false memory
that I actually dated
her all right but here's the best
one I almost don't want to show you this
one but it's just too
good all right here's the best one now
you tell me does it look like we have
chemistry
[Laughter]
yes now it's not exactly what my body
looks like
but it's still impressive all right so
that's enough of that
how impressed are you at the quality of
the images they're they're kind of
amazing anyway here's there's some
science uh from the univers
casa Spain I know that was a perfect
pronunciation A lot of people would have
had trouble with it because it's a
foreign language but uh I just have a
thing with languages so univers Dad
castilo La Mana that that's how you do
it anyway according to
them people who take a higher number of
steps every day are likely to have
less depressive
symptoms huh the people who are more
active have less
depression what's also true is that
people who have more depression don't
feel like
walking so is it backward science is it
and they admit that they think it might
be backwards by the way so in this in
this case they're very aware that it's
correlation not causation but why is it
so complicated to know what is the
causation it's because it works both
ways there's two causations one if
you're depressed you're not going to
take a walk two if you could force
yourself to take a walk it would
probably make you less depressed so it's
a it's sort of uh not backward science
it's more like bisexual two-way
science sure let's call it
that meanwhile there's some microchips
being uh developed that look like they
could identify a whole range of diseases
from things like just your breath and
other other factors I guess according to
Ken Richard at the not trick
Zone um oh wait no this is a different
study I'm on to a different
study so let me give you some about the
chips for measuring stuff so um a number
of years ago I was at a Berkeley event
where some startups were pitching their
stuff and one of them that I invested in
was a startup that had a uh very
inexpensive portable chip based thing
for testing your blood so you'd give it
um this smallest little sample which
actually they would take from not even
pinching you I think they would do it
with like a Band-Aid thing that would
slightly pierce your skin and then they
put that Band-Aid thing on it and it
would do a blood test now that startup I
don't think worked out I haven't checked
in with them but I don't I don't think
they hadit a home run there but that was
based on the fact that after 911 the
government funded a both bunch of
studies to develop to see if he could
develop quickly a way to detect you know
chemical weapons so because the
government funded fast ways to detect
chemical weapons the technology was
developed that could also detect other
things and also be portable and
inexpensive but that was years ago so it
looks like they've got something else
going in that domain I think that's
going to replace your doctor if you give
me Ai and you give me a chip that can
find most of my diseases
um I'm 80% good I mean other than
catastrophic things that's most of my
Healthcare anyway um back to Ken Richard
at the no trick Zone there's a study
that finds there's no measurable effect
of reducing uh emissions so the climate
won't be any better because of it
why well this is the funniest the
funniest potential debunk of climate
change models that you'll see
I'm not going to say that I believe this
is
true this is just a claim right studies
studies are about half of them are true
um but research found according to this
one
study that uh you get a lot of climate
effects um when CO2 is up to a certain
range but then after that range as the
CO2 continues to go up you do not get a
predictable amount of warming and the
theory is that at first you know if you
went from no CO2 or low CO2 to a little
bit you would see an increase in heat
but we're way past that so where we are
the amount of CO2 we have in the air if
you were to double it it wouldn't make
much difference so apparently there's
there's something about the nature of
CO2 that a little bit of it will get you
warm but if you quadruple it bar makes a
difference it was the little bit to make
you warm that mattered let me see if I
can come up with an
analogy this is a bad analogy let's say
if you were painting a room in your
house and you put one coat on it you'd
say uh not good enough you put two coats
of paint on it you're good you you've
got a nicely painted room what if you
put a third coat on it the third coat
wouldn't make any
difference what about a fourth coat no
difference so in so the claim and I'm
not saying it's true it's just a
study is that uh the only the only
differences that the CO2 would make the
biggest part is already made and we're
fine so even if we did even if we spent
trillions of dollars to try to you know
desperately try to keep that number from
rising wouldn't make any difference now
is that true I don't know but I'll tell
you what is definitely true the models
do not predict the future all they
predict is the assumptions you put into
them they predict the
past climate models predict the
past do you know how because they tell
you what assumptions you put in in them
in the past you if you show me a a
climate model and I were an expert in
models and climate models I could look
at it and say h I predict that in the
past you assumed that the temperature
goes up smoothly at the same rate as the
CO2 that's my prediction did you do that
in the
past yeah we did nailed it nailed it I
predicted the
past does it predict the
future I doubt
it but it but it definitely predicts the
past it'll tell you what assumption she
put a new model in the
past all right um I think there's some
fake news out there on the political
right but I'm not positive so the
political right is all upset and I've
I've reported on this
too that the Biden Administration is
selling off uh perfectly good parts of
the Southern Wall um
components that are being sold for scrap
when uh Biden when it's clear that Trump
would use them so we're just wasting our
money and the story is that it's you
know supposedly bad for Trump because
you'll have to spend more money to build
wall but I saw Jessica tarlo on the five
the other day saying that was fake
news how many of you have heard that's
fake news now I'm not saying it is I'm
just saying how many of you have heard
the claim that that was fake news have
you even heard the
claim CU I I wonder how much is getting
through into their into our bubble cuz
I'm in the same bubble you are I only
saw one one little sliver of that which
is I was doing something else and I I
heard Jessica guitar love and you know
just talking while the TV was on and I
was like what
what so some of you yes so I believe her
argument was that the stuff being sold
was actually
junk now what's the difference between
perfectly good wall and junk I don't
know
but I think you'll recall that when I
first told you the story I suggested
that there might be more to it as then
there might be a reason they're throwing
it away so there is a counter claim and
the counter claim I don't know the
details of it but would suggest exactly
what I was I was imagining it would
suggest that not all the wall is the
same and that there might be parts of it
that they they concluded were not usable
maybe they they were stored incorrectly
maybe there were the wrong
specifications maybe they don't um maybe
there's some structural problem I don't
know so uh just put a put a pin in this
one when I first heard that
story I had a I didn't say it and I
should have so this is on me wasn't a
little bit too much on the
nose when you heard that Biden is
selling off the wall that everybody
knows would be a good idea to keep
do you think that that really did that
sound like a real story when you first
heard it or did it sound like exactly
the kind of things that are fake stories
it sounded it sounded to me like exactly
like a fake story like it just had all
the characteristics of an obviously fake
story but I didn't see any
reporting and as of today I think Fox
News is
still and other major pundits Who would
know better are still reporting is a
real thing so I'll put it out there as a
question mark If I had to put my money
on it I would bet it's fake if I had to
put my money on it I'd bet it's fake but
I don't know so we'll find
out um do you remember I don't if you
even noticed there was a lot of news
about how if you're using a black
spatula or black any of the black kind
of kitchen utensils you were poisoning
yourself because there was stuff in that
plastic that was coming off and getting
in your body and yesterday I
almost I almost replaced all of my black
plastic um kitchen wear because it's
basically all I have it's all black
plastic kitchen wear and I thought damn
it you know they were they were pretty
adamant that there was some bad stuff in
there I better replace it Well turns out
according to ours
Technica that uh they made an error in
the math and they added an extra zero
and they were off by
10x they were off by factor of
10 it it is 10% as dangerous as they
said and it wasn't exactly that
dangerous so so what did the scientists
do when they found out that instead of
finding out that it was above the safe
level it was actually one1 of the safe
level so obviously they immediately
apologized they immediately retracted
the paper and concluded that uh black
plastic spatulas are just fine right
obviously obviously that's what they did
no no what they did was they said oh uh
it's right
directionally so instead of being more
than you can
tolerate is on10th of what you can
tolerate but still it's the same point
because it's on10th of what you you can
tolerate so they've decided that they'll
you know keep the
conclusion but the numbers will change
by
10x but not the conclusion conclusion is
fine but the climate change models are
all good
right the climate change models are all
good
right in order to believe the climate
change models uh sometimes I think you
would have had to spend no time in in
real life in real life all of this stuff
is fake all of it it's all
fake
anyway well apparently there's going to
be lasers on
drones uh somebody in North
Korea um not not North Korea um Hong
Kong researcher according to new Atlas
uh found a way to put powerful lasers on
drones but they did it in a clever way
because you're saying to yourself oh
Scott Scott Scott Scott oh let me let me
let me clear this up for you you are so
dumb Scott about all things science and
here's another example of it because you
couldn't possibly You couldn't possibly
support the weight of uh the weight of a
laser that would be powerful enough to
do any damage you'd never be able to put
this big truck siiz laser on a drone
Scott you freaking
idiot well they didn't do that they're
using a mirror on the Drone and they
have a groundbased laser that they would
shoot up to the mirror I'm simplifying
it's more than a mirror I'm simplifying
they hit the mirror and then it would
form into a deadly laser beam if they
aimed it
correctly which is remarkably impressive
technology if they can make it work um
it's not the first time this thought of
because there had been space-based
ideas for space-based satellites that
would also reflect a laser maybe those
already exist would we know I don't know
it's kind of cool idea so you need a
truck size thing to make that work but
the truck would be on the
ground um support for nuclear energy is
an all-time high you're
welcome I say that because I was one of
several people who for the last eight
years have been banging that drum you
don't understand it's safer than you
think you know the modern ones are not
as dangerous as the old ones they know
how to handle the waste um Etc so
apparently that got through but
according to just the
news um 70% of men support nuclear
energy but only 44% of
women why the difference and don't say
something
sexist why is there such a gigantic
difference about something that that
isn't personal to women it's not like
it's an
abortion it's not personal to women in
any way why would there be a gigantic
difference
well answer the question without being a
sexist you
sexists why do you why do you think
there would be an enormous
difference look at the comment and you
can
tell so my audience has largely been all
completely informed that nuclear energy
is not only good but necessary which is
what all the tech all the tech leaders
are saying they're all saying it's not
only good it's required we're going to
need it for AI and other stuff now my
audience is 8 85%
male and I've I've trained my 85% male
audience completely every one of you
could could argue about nuclear energy
you know at your next party and you'd
know what you're talking about but also
15% of the women the women who are
watching me would also be able to argue
the same I think it has to do with what
sources of information men and women use
I think the podcaster world and the tech
bro world is 100% Pro nuclear
energy if you watched Joe Rogan somebody
would have been on there like Michael
shellenberger for example and would have
said nuclear energy you know you have it
all wrong nuclear energy is great it's
necessary it's required really and who
watches what's the gender breakdown of
Joe Rogan it's probably not too far from
mine it's probably 8020 I'm just
guessing but mostly
male how many people are following you
know Michael shellenberger
yeah so if you just go right down the
line I think you would find that the the
more Tech
oriented topics attract men and so men
become informed on Tech oriented things
if I said to you um what percentage of
men versus women have a pretty good
understanding of
cryptocurrencies it would also skew male
wouldn't it much less much less but it
was skew male maybe 6040 there there are
tons of women who are deeply into crypto
uh and know what they're talking about
but still at least
6040 what about uh electric
cars if I were going to get into a
debate about the pros and cons of
electric cars who do you think would be
more informed about that men not because
men are awesome but because they would
just
automatically they're drawn to topics
like that and podcasts like that and
articles like that
so we kind of like our nerdy stuff so it
makes sense but it also but it also
suggests a a fixable problem it sounds
like women are less informed on the pros
and cons of nuclear energy and again
this has nothing to do with being female
there's there's no gender anything here
it's just that there there are natural
preferences of podcasts and new sources
so this is a big problem and I would
argue you that the uh the resistance to
nuclear
energy if we had not had it which means
if women had been on the right page
because women are on just the wrong page
there there are very few topics where I
can just say oh you're 100% wrong right
if we're talking about abortion it's
very
subjective but not nuclear power nuclear
power is purely objective and it just is
clearly in One Direction you should do a
lot of it
so that's an education problem if we
don't educate women on some of these
nerdy
things we're going to have problems
getting things done that need to get
done all right well Comm Harris uh
emerged to do some more word salad and
uh I feel like she has about four
sentences that you can just interchange
and then just repeat them in different
order and you would have a Comm Harris
speech
um so kind of goes like this but with a
drunken
accent we have to put in the work we'
have not been
defeated our Spirits have not been
defeated because we're going to put in
the
work and I've been very very
clear that we've not been
defeated now we're going to put in the
work and we know we stand for and we
know democracy
matters I've been very
clear and as long as we put it in the
work no individual can take away our
power because I've been very clear we
put it in the
work so that's basically ear speech
right
there and I would like to make a
persuasion suggestion to K Harris now
that she's lost I can give her this
advice do you know the worst possible
 thing you could ever say if
you're running for
office we need to put in the work don't
ever say
that nobody likes work let's
compare uh we're really going to have to
put it in the
work compare that to make America great
again
oh make America healthy again you got
got me okay got it we're entering the
Golden Age
oh really the Golden Age nice my energy
is up let's make America great again
make it healthy again the Golden
Age I've been very clear we're going to
have to do the work do the work I've
been very clear they can't steal our
democracy I've been very
clear so which one's better
I mean I don't want to get all
analytical but which one do you like
make America great again
or got put in work w got to work
harder all
right that's uh she's a anti-p
persuasive is what I call her let's see
let me tell you the least surprising
news according to Zero Hedge uh the
Philadelphia fed finds that all the jobs
created in the second quarter were
fake really so the Biden
Administration when it needed the jobs
to look good it was maybe the most
important thing that they
needed I had some statistics that have
all been let's say modified and
corrected and improved since then and
now we know that all of the job growth
was fake it was fake
have I told you have I ever told you
that all data that matters is
fake if you could remember just one
thing about the world it would protect
you so much all data that matters is
fake now that matters is doing a lot of
work there so for example if you were to
uh count the number of shoes in your
closet and there were too many for your
storage space well you know the data
matters so I mean it doesn't matter to
the world but so in small ways data is
useful in small ways data is useful but
whenever there's a big data that can
only be put together by the special
people you know not everybody can do a a
climate change analysis it's got to be
the special people not everybody can
tell you how much the employment is this
quarter I can't do it you can't do it
you have to listen to the special people
so when the special people are in charge
let's see are these vaccinations going
to be good for us or bad for us let's
ask the special people because we can't
really tell
ourselves whenever the special people
control the data it's
fake do you know how I know that because
it used to be my job to tell people what
the data was when I worked in big
companies do you think I was concerned
about the accuracy of the data yes if it
didn't
matter but if it mattered I was
concerned about not getting
fired and when it
mattered I gave my boss whatever he
wanted that was my
job and all I had to do is change the
assumptions I didn't even have to lie I
didn't even have to do anything
dishonest I could just look at my
assumptions and say well you know if I
tweak that one it's going to give my
boss exactly what he wants and then is
that dishonest no because I would
footnote well not even footnote I'd say
it directly uh these are my assumptions
and it would actually be an assumption
page so whenever I did a any kind of a
projection Financial Pro projection
which I did for a
living I would list my assumptions and
if you were if you were to read those
assumptions You' say huh that looks kind
of subjective you could have gone this
way or the other way and there would be
an argument both ways so I pick the way
that my boss liked just like every other
person who does numbers every other
person gives their boss what they want
if you think it happens some other way
you're not working in you're not living
in the real
world yeah in the real world the boss
gets what they ask for that's how money
Works anyway Zero Hedge was uh reporting
on
that so you know how Trump won the case
against George Stephan nois who said he
had been found liable for rape and then
I saw on social media a bunch of other
people uh passing around you know video
of other people who had also said that
Trump was a rapist they said oh you know
pretty soon you're GNA have to pay $15
million so it was a way to say that what
Stephanopoulos was doing was what
everybody else was doing and they should
all be sued as well
but they weren't doing what he was doing
what stenopus was doing
was more unique than what the others
were
doing if somebody says Trump is a
racist or Trump is a rapist or Trump is
dishonest or Trump is anything whatever
they say that's an
opinion you're you're fine if it's just
an
opinion so if you say he is a certain
bad thing that's an opinion but if you
say that somebody that a court found him
liable for rape and that is not
technically true then you're in
trouble especially if you are a news
organization if you're a news
organization and you've covered that
specific news in
detail and that specific news never
produced the the true fact I'm saying
it's not a true fact uh and there was
never a point where he was found liable
for
rape I if I understand it correctly the
liability was because he called her a
liar and then the core found in their
opinion by a majority that uh that it
wasn't a
lie but they did not find
him um guilty or liable for rape they
found him liable for lying about the
situation according to the jury and we
don't know if they lied
but uh as uh Byron New York pointed out
if you look at the uh how many times
stephanus phrased his question with the
phrase liable for rape he said it like
10 times in about five minutes about 10
times he said liable for rape but he's
liable for rape liable for rape liable
for
rape so that's how you know it wasn't an
accident like if he said it once but
maybe the other times he'd put the
Nuance on it he'd probably be fine but
if you say it 10 times emphatically and
you're a news organization and you work
for the news part of the news
organization and the news said that
didn't happen but you're saying it did
happen 10 times in a row and it's the
worst thing you could say to somebody in
public right in front of them yeah I
guess you lose $15
million I think this one totally makes
sense
apparently Trump liked that and he might
be looking at suing 60 minutes and and
pollster and Selzer for election
interference I guess but 60 Minutes
famously took a Comm haris answer that
was just word salid and they replaced
the word salid answer with her answer to
a different question spliced it together
and looked like she had a coherent
answer to a
question now can you sue somebody for
that CU that certainly looks like
election interference to me it was a an
important and rare the rare part is
important too it was a very important
highlevel rare interview with KL Harris
and they completely changed the reality
so that you would see a non-reality and
vote on it instead of a
reality is that against the law well
it's not against the law probably just
lying but did it was it intentional
election
interference well I guess we'll have to
let a jury decide that
maybe because it definitely interfered
with the election but it's also maybe
free speech I don't know so I'm not sure
which way the the court case would go
but there's certainly a claim there I
mean that's a real claim then the the
one about uh
uh the pollster and szer I guess the
argument there would be you'd have to
prove that she really knew that her poll
results that said that KL Harris was way
ahead in Iowa which was
impossible um you'd have to say that she
knew she was wrong and did it anyway
meaning she was trying to influence the
election I would say the the evidence
strongly
suggests in a circumstantial but not a
proven way that it would be hard to
explain what we saw unless it was
intentional and the argument for that
for that is that she was such a good
pollster if you're that good a pollster
and you come up with a number that's
clearly out of the end of the field with
all the other pollsters and you don't
catch it and you don't at least say
we're not sure this is true or at least
put a foot note on it like we don't you
know we'll see if this persists next
week but we're worried maybe there's a
problem here that would be the way to
handle that so should she be sued well I
don't know it it looks crooked to me but
there's no
evidence or proof let's say there's no
proof of corruption because if her
argument is I just made a
mistake and by the way I'm
retiring You could argue that she
retired because she knew she couldn't
maintain her reputation after this or
you could also say that the reason she's
retiring is that maybe she thinks she's
like losing a step and that that part of
the reason for retiring is that she
wasn't confident she could do her job as
well as she wanted to so whether that's
true or not if feels like it would be a
pretty good defense
so um I don't know that he could win on
those but the uh stepanus one was a real
clear case but back to that it seems to
me that stefanus and ABC are often
associated with the let's say the fake
news Matrix meaning that they're
definitely inventors of fake news and
maintainers of fake news so I think that
what stopus was doing was there was
probably some
meeting and they said we have to say not
that he paid uh EEG and Carol but that
we have to make it sound more rapy and
that they said let's try this let's try
liel for rape even though he technically
wasn't but he was liable for accusing no
saying that accusing her of lying but
lying about the rape which is kind of
close to being liable for rape it's like
it's like the cousin of it and the ne
the ZIP code next door but it's not so
what's the way what is the best way we
can fool the public into thinking
something that happened that didn't
happen or maybe didn't
happen and I think that I think the
phrase liable for rape is not a George
stephanopolous invention that he just
liked to say I would say that that is
professional work that the that the
party told him to say and then like a
good party aaric he just repeated it
repeat it and tried to make it a thing
so everybody else would repeat it as
well instead he got his ass
sued so maybe you got got a little too
close to the Sun there George
bummer um I've heard separately that uh
that EEG Carol did a uh she did a
magazine cover for the Atlantic um in
which the headline said You know here
she is wearing the same dress she was
wearing when Trump sexually assaulted
her in Berg
offs so that was the claim that she
still had the dress she has such a good
memory of the event that she remembers
the clothes she was wearing still has it
and wanted to show you wearing it to
really make her Story
Land but it turns out that that
particular dress wasn't even uh in
stores or available until long after the
alleged sexual attack
now do you think the do you think the
jury or the judge heard the evidence
that she was claiming she was wearing a
dress that did not exist at the time of
the claim given that the quality of her
memory was mostly what was on trial
because if everybody agreed she had a
perfect memory and was telling the truth
well then Trump's
guilty but really the whole trial was
about are these things you think you
remember real
clearly a major really major part of the
case that she remembers the details
including what she was wearing have been
debunked and I don't think the jury
heard that
so it makes me wonder um so this gets
back to uh Reed Hoffman who
funded um Eugene Carroll's case that
might be one of the creepiest worst
things that's ever happened in politics
from a citizen you know short of actual
violence finding this victim and
resurrecting a charge and selling it by
by keeping important information away
from the jury everything about this is
the worst of human activity this is
really really bad dark stuff so Reed
Hoffman probably has some karma coming
for him
uh for this if nothing
else so Biden apparently has pardoned or
commuted the prison sentence of an
Islamic terrorist he's the half brother
of the billionaire Hamas
leader let me say that again according
to
Breitbart um Joe Joe Biden has commuted
the
sentence of the half brother of the
billionaire Hamas
leader and he was involved also in
funding the
terrorism so he wasn't just
related he was involved he was helping
fund
it now some speculate and I think this
is good speculation that this is not an
independent act but rather related to
some negotiations about the hostages you
could easily imagine that part neg
negotiations are that Israel would have
to free a bunch of prisoners maybe
America has some prisoners to free and
this might be it so it's probably in the
larger context of a prisoner swap thing
and something that Biden's trying to get
done before Trump gets it
done but this would definitely be
negotiating with
terrorist this would be negotiating with
terrorist does that work
I I used to think it worked no I didn't
I never thought it worked didn't didn't
we didn't we all know that negotiating
with terrorists just never works
ever all right well we'll see what
happens um so the Tik Tock is scheduled
to go out of existence for American
customers um in January unless
something
changes so Tik Tok filed an emergency
appeal with the Supreme Court to block
the
ban and uh Trump's looking at it and uh
he's more favorable to Tik Tock
because Tik Tok helped him get
elected he believes it because he got he
got the youth vote and it probably made
a difference um so on on one hand here's
let me break it down on one hand Tik Tok
is a a Chinese propaganda machine that
is an existential threat to America so
that would be you an argument for
Banning it is that it's an existential
threat essentially a weapon in the hands
of our biggest
adversary but on the other
hand uh Trump did do his Trump thing
where he grabs the gun out of their hand
and turns around and uses it on them so
Trump instead of you know Banning Tik
Tock or wanting to he joined it did so
well on Tik Tok that it helped him win
the election so you could see why he'd
want to keep it but on the third
hand we should take into account that a
a major donor to Trump to Republicans
and Trump in particular a major donor is
also a major owner of Tik Tok in
addition to China it's uh um he's a
investor he's got a lot of money in it
so Trump's protecting a uh a
donator but on the fifth
hand China does have the right of free
speech in America right oh no it
doesn't all right here's an argument I'm
going to make that I
wonder I wonder if anybody has made on
this case so far because I think this
will be the first time you've heard
it so China obviously doesn't have the
right of free speech in America because
they're not American residents or
citizens uh actually resident would be
good enough I guess
um but if China is managing the
algorithm then the algorithm determines
what parts of people's Free Speech
reaches whose
ears
right so they control the algorithm
um so the cumulative speech that's
coming out of U let's put it this
way the individuals the American
individuals using Tik Tock are
exercising their freedom of
speech
protected but the the vehicle Tik Tock
the platform they use since it gets to
decide who sees what by changing the
algorithm the algorithm effectively
changes the
speech because let's say you had 10
people saying uh Israel must be uh must
succeed and one message that says Israel
must be destroyed but let's say China
decides to show the one message instead
of the 10 messages who whose free speech
is that it's not really just the person
who said it it's China's free speech so
China speaking through the algorithm
that speaks through Tik Tock is
exercising its freedom of speech in
America that it doesn't have China
doesn't have free speech people
do so let me say it a different
way individuals using Tik Tock if you
knew that the things they said would
reach a predictable audience the one
that they wanted to reach then that
would be pure pre free speech and I'd
actually be cool with that but if
individuals are saying what they want to
say but then that doesn't get to who
they want it to get to with a
reliability that they'd like rather it
gets massaged combined moved to some
people sometimes and some people other
times who controlled the speech in that
case because in that case the the
messages that are being received are
mostly because of and managed by the
algorithm
meaning
China so it's not that citizens are
using free speech on Tik Tok that's a
minor part of it the major part of it is
that the speech collectively has to be
analyzed as a collective speech and we
don't have a law that says if the
average of your algorithm you know
creates some speech there's a law
against it or or it's a right I don't
know that there's any right
about Chinese algorithmically managed
speech is that a right they're not
citizens and they're the ones
controlling what you actually
consume
so
anyway that's it for that
um so there were rumors that RFK junor
was opposed to the polio
vaccine and he uh he answered a question
on his way to something he said I'm all
for the polio vaccine so it was fake
news that he was opposed to the polio
vaccine is it fake news that he suspects
the childhood vaccinations in general
are dangerous that's not fake news
that's real but his plan is not to ban
him his plan is to make sure we have the
right data to decide what we're doing
and that makes sense
but uh Democrats are apparently afraid
of science now which which is the
perfect complete
turnaround I am old enough to remember
when it was just an assumption that
Democrats had the good firm grasp of
Science and the Neanderthals on the
right were just ignoring science left
and right they were science
deniers but now you've got Democrats who
are opposed to RFK
Jr making sure that we have good science
for our health care decisions and
they're against
it so I'm not so sure they're the pro
science
Group Well the mayor Eric Adams
Situation's getting interesting because
Trump actually said that he'd be uh he
was unfairly treated and he'd consider
pardoning him so Democrat mayor Eric
Adams of New York who has been strong on
strong on the
borders strong against
Crime and
uh and uh yeah now he's and he was
against wokeness
basically
so let's see strong on crime strong on
borders and he's anti-woke and he's
being lawed maybe what does that sound
like to you a person who's strong On the
Border strong on crime
anti-woke and maybe getting lawf fared
by
democrats that's a
republican he used to be a republican
but I I don't think he ever really
changed because
uh so here's what I think might be
happening I think it's entirely
possible that uh mayor Eric Adams will
turn back Republican
in return for a
pardon I don't know if that's legal to
offer something in return for a pardon
but if what he offered was you know if I
get a pardon I'm just going to register
as Republican and we're going to go from
there because it would be a hell of a
story hell of a story now I understand
that he has he has some democrat
positions that you don't like so we're
just keeping an eye on this I don't have
a strong preference it's just a good
story
meanwhile Bill Maher on Club random was
talking
to uh comedian guest actor whose name I
can't remember but
uh but apparently Bill Mah is no longer
suffering the worst of the
TDS so he's decided we might be able to
survive the Trump era without losing our
democracy so here's what he said on Club
random Bill Mo uh and the truth is
you're probably going to be able to keep
doing that meaning just doing normal
life and no matter what's going out
there in the world of course the worst
thing Could Happen Trump could get into
office and blow up the world on day one
could happen obviously it won't he goes
but you
know I'm not going through the same
Spiel I did last time like when it
happens wake me but I'm not giving my
mind over to it again and I'll see what
happens and here's the here's the kill
shot
you ready Bill Mor says and one thing
I've learned about the future is that
we're very bad at predicting it and
whenever you think is probably likely to
happen probably isn't going to happen
let me read that again one thing I've
learned about the future is that
we are very bad at predicting it we
we all are are we bad at predicting the
future you and I and Bill we
we cuz I remember over 70 million
Americans who got it all right
in 2016 all right in 2020 but
there weren't enough of them the other
side won and all right in
2024 70 million people three out of
three and he calls that we can't predict
the future yes we can 70 million
people got the future right three times
in a row and not just a little bit like
completely
right three times in a row it's the same
people who spotted all the fake news
three times in a
row right actually 100 times in a
row so this this just fascinates the
hell enemy because I think Bill Maher is
actually chewing through the wall of his
prison and I think he's going to make it
out that you know I I would have bet
against it I would have bet against it
but but he is so close that he's gotten
to the the barrier and the barrier wall
is that the the future is hard to
predict it's really
[Laughter]
not not for 70 million people on the
right they kind of got everything right
for 12 years in a row if he hasn't if he
can't go that final the final step he
can't get out of the he can't get out of
his trap he's got One Step left and that
one step
is I Bill Maher am bad at predicting the
future because I've been reading too
much fake
news we are not bad at predicting the
future we're not perfect lot get lots
wrong but we're pretty darn good at it
do you know why the do you know why the
political right is better at predicting
the
future because the political right is
not suffering under a bunch of weird you
know
illusions that they look at
motivation so when you see Elon Musk was
posting the other day about something
you know would motivate this I think it
was if you if you hire somebody to get
rid of x x will never be gotten rid of
because that's the person's job if he
gets rid of it he doesn't have a job so
the incentive structure is high somebody
to get rid of problem X will guarantee
that problem X never goes away because
the guy's getting paid to stay there and
fight it not to not to beat it and go
away so as long as as long as
Republicans understand
incentives and they also understand the
news is all
fake they're going to be in pretty good
shape for predicting the future if the
Democrats still think the news is real
because they read the New York
Times and they don't know that
incentives are the only thing that makes
anything predictable is the incentive
structure they will be wrong
forever you you just got to learn these
two things the news is intentionally
wrong
intentionally if you don't understand
that it's intentionally wrong then
you're really going to be lost because
nobody makes that many mistakes
accidentally all
right
um that's enough that meanwhile Derek
chauvin's lawyers or Derek shauvin
himself maybe is he won the right to
reexamine the heart tissue and fluid
samples from George Floyd's body because
there was one hypothesis that somehow
didn't make it to chovin that there was
some Doctor Who hypothesized Floyd had a
specific kind of heart condition that
would have killed
them so if they can find that the heart
tissue and samples are suggestive of
that specific heart
condition then he's got a you know a
cause maybe overturning it or getting a
pardon or I don't know something
and I don't know if this is going to
work it feels like a bit of a long
shot but I feel like Trump's thirdd act
just needs it it just needs it I think
Trump needs to find out that the climate
change alarm was a little overdone he
needs to find out that all the hoaxes
were hoaxes he needs to find out that
the elections didn't have the Integrity
that people hoped for and he needs and
we need to overturn the Derek Chauvin
thing maybe the Daniel peny not guilty
verdict was you know getting us moving
in the right
direction we'll see but uh Trump's
getting ready to run the table on all
that stuff
uh there's a rumor Trump says he might
be consider not a rumor I guess the news
he says he's considering the
privatization of the post
office uh unusual Wales was reporting
that and um somebody said it's the the
post office is a garbage delivery
service that's exactly how I see the
post office so I've got this box at the
end of my
driveway that every few days I have to
go and empty and almost never almost
never is it anything but garbage it's
literally just garbage in fact I like to
check my mail on uh the day after
garbage day because on garbage day the
mailbox is sitting next to my uh
garbage so I just open up the garbage
take out the mail and put it in the
garbage and that's that's my most
efficient mail day now I do check it to
make sure there's there's nothing
strange in there but at most I have
maybe three things three things that
ever come to me in the mail that I care
about and those three things easily
could turn into digital bills and you
know emails so I don't really have a
reason for a post office do you yeah we
have competing services and they would
just pick up the difference so
yeah I think maybe getting out of the
postal service business is exactly what
2025
requires um meanwhile so here's the
Trump effect I've got a few Trump effect
stories so Gavin new said that
California's been working to reduce
costs in government and he's going to
eliminate 62,000 positions in California
um that are government jobs but here's
what he had the nerve to say this is
Gavin Newsome governor of California
quote we've been working before before
Doge was Doge it's like a promo project
we're going to eliminate 62,000
positions California is a leader in that
space so here's what comes after total
capitulation so the Democrat Party
completely
annihilated just nothing left and what
you're seeing is that people are finding
it might be safer to embrace Trump than
to embrace Democrats now that's fully
destroyed
he he's actually went from everything
Trump does is bad and he's Hitler and
he's going to steal your democracy to
all the way all the way to we're going
to do Trump stuff better than Trump
we're GNA do even more Trump stuff and
sooner than Trump that Trump stuff is so
good that I'd like to brag about doing
the Trump stuff even faster than
Trump now how can Trump win harder than
that that's the hardest Trump could ever
win is have somebody bragging on the you
know on the defeated team having
somebody bragging that they're acting
more like Trump every
day how do you win harder than that my
God but anyway also uh good work Gavin
Nome so I like to be the guy who doesn't
say everything's bad on the other team
if this is real if they really
eliminated 62,000 positions and it
really makes sense this is just good
work do more of this
please all right uh as you know Reuters
is a sketchy organization and their news
looks like it's you know uh looks like
it's intentionally just Democrat fake
news but did you know that Reuters is
more than just um alleged fake news they
also have some side businesses and they
have uh over $300 million in government
contracts uh this is according to Mike
Benz
they have 11 different Biden uh agencies
targeting elon's
business and all 11 agencies are paid
millions are paying Millions to
Reuters so the same government agencies
that are weaponized against Elon Musk
are funding
Reuters you all see what's going on here
so
reers man and then it gets better it
gets better so I'm going to say the
first two parts again so that when I say
the third part you'll you'll just like
throw your phone across the room are you
ready for this are you ready you better
be sitting down for
this I'll just read the first part again
the B uh so this is from Mike Benz the
Biden Administration paid Reuters over
300 million in government contracts
again for their side businesses and 11
different Biden government agencies
targeted Elon musk's businesses and all
11 have paid millions of dollars to
Reuters and here's the third part wait
for it Reuters then won the Pulitzer
Prize for their work on uh Elon musk's
misconduct in his
businesses no don't throw your phone
don't do it don't no don't do it calm
down is this real it's real yeah I me B
Ben always shows the receipts when Mike
Benz tells you something's happening he
always as far as I know he always has
the the public publicly available link
you can look look and see it yourself so
I think all of this is just
public but but until somebody like bends
pulls together the the different parts
you don't see the picture do you you
can't see the picture until he shows you
how it's connected to everything which
is
uh how what would we do without Mike
Ben and the Glenn greenwalls and the uh
Michael shellenberger and the the Matt
taies um Elon to some extent David
Sachs but we now have this constellation
of uh temporarily anyway right leaning
people who all have this ability to see
the entire field and all the connections
we didn't have that before
yeah well I'll add Mike cernovich to the
list somebody who sees the
connections uh Jack pabc sees the
connections
um uh Bannon in the war room he sees the
connections so I could go on you know
with a dozen more names but the the
ability of the political right to
understand the whole field and see all
the connections is really really
impressive at this point I I I think
they're unbeatable for a
while well you know the story about the
radioactive material that went missing
near New Jersey earlier in
December and then we've got all these
reports of the drones so some people say
those drones are looking for the cat 3
nuclear waste now first of all cat 3
nuclear waste doesn't seem to be like a
super dangerous kind I'm no expert but
cat 3 isn't exactly a dirty bomb is it I
mean I'm not sure why I'm not I don't
know that you could even weaponize it if
you wanted to so I'll look for a fact
check on that if somebody can tell me
later or in the comments could you
weaponize what they call Cat 3 nuclear
waste I think it's something from
medical
processes what do you think can you
weaponize that so but whether you can or
not um here's what I know you wouldn't
use drones alone and you wouldn't use
these kinds of drones to look for
radiation um I know that because it just
I didn't realize this but I know
somebody I know somebody personally who
was involved in looking for weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq and they were
looking for radiation signals and what
we learned from that is that you would
have uh most of the work would be in the
ground
so it's not impossible that there could
be an Airborne element to
it but I think even if in the old days
anyway in Ira they would have to drop
down some kind of a sensor I don't think
they could just fly over unless they
have some new tech we don't know about
which is possible they might have new
tech but in the classic sense of looking
for radiation you need to be on the
ground and you need to have your devices
for looking for it on the ground flying
1,000 feet in the air or 500 F feet in
the air probably doesn't get it done if
you're looking for a you know week
signal so I would say the um The
Coincidence of the
Lost materials is probably not related
to the drones I'm going to I'm going to
say not related but here's some updates
number one apparently what the
government the federal
government emphasis on the federal
government apparently the approach
they're going to take is that there
there were never on any unusual
drones so everything was either a legal
airplane or a hobbyist drone or a
commercial drone but nothing actually
happened there was no unusual activity
whatsoever and that will be their
story
now this is fun for me because you know
I like the persuasion and the uh the you
know all the the psychological elements
of the
story could it be
possible even
remotely that there was not a single
unusual
drone now I'm going to say I haven't
seen anything that convinces me I saw
any unusual drones on any photography or
any
video I've seen things that people who
were there in person who took the
pictures say oh this was not normal
didn't look like a plane it was too low
too many of them and that sort of things
but I haven't
personally seen anything but you know
Shady videos that look like regular
planes or regular drones or something so
I haven't seen any evidence of drones
have
you just think about that I've been
following the story and I haven't seen
any evidence of drones that I would
consider
reliable but here's a thing that is
reliable the people who are standing
there at the moment and saying I
standing here and I'm looking at a sky
that's doesn't look normal here's what's
happening these things are these things
are hovering the hovering might be a
mistake the hovering might be that they
were just in the distance coming toward
you and they look like they're hovering
but actually they're just in close to
you
slowly so is it
possible that this is 100% Mass
hysteria is that possible because here
here's why I'm resisting it I'm res
resisting it because I didn't see
it and that's sort of my
job I feel like it's my job when when a
masses stere forms that I should be the
one to tell you it formed and I've been
saying I don't think so I I don't think
so did I get taken by this did did I get
taken by a Mass
area and again I'd like to emphasize
that including individuals that I know
personally when they're standing there
looking at it they'll tell you very
clearly this stuff is not normal what
whatever we're looking at this is not
not
normal which is also very
persuasive
so here's what I think might have
happened this is pure
speculation what I think might have
happened is they had to do a lot of
training or maybe they were testing some
new technology for drones but that it
was real it was real and it did last for
over a month but now they're done or
they need to do less of it or they found
another place to do it so now that the
sightings will be decreased because they
don't have the need to do
it um they can say it never
happened and they can walk outside and
say look well I don't see anything
nothing happening now and all those
videos you sent were the pilots are all
saying they're just airplanes apparently
Pilots are having a good laugh at the
whole situation because the professional
Pilots believe they're experts and they
believe that they can tell looking at a
picture that it's definitely planes or
or ordinary drones or I I
guess here's a perfect example um go the
former governor of
Maryland um was posting a video of some
drones that he was watching that turned
out to be the Stars Beetle juu and
Bellatrix so the former governor of me
uh former governor of Maryland couldn't
tell the difference between
stars and
vehicles and that's probably what a lot
of people were
doing
so I'm I'm G to I'm going to be right on
the fence on this one I don't know how
much of this was mass his area I'm
guaranteed that 95% of it was Mass hisy
area so I don't know about the 5% but
I'm sure that most of the sightings were
airplanes that I'm sure of that most of
the sightings were airplanes that still
leaves plenty of room for mysterious
drones that were more than we've ever
seen so I'm going to go with the
government was definitely doing
something like Trump said the White
House knows exactly what they were doing
probably training or testing out
something and they're now they're done
because they had an immediate need but
they met met their immediate need uh
probably preparing for
war I hope it's in the Middle East and
not here
and now the government can claim it
never
happened they'll just debunk all the
photos and videos say no no that's just
a it's just a bad photo and a bad video
nothing happened and then you won't see
anything happening at the moment so you
won't be able to get any new or better
pictures so they can just say nope never
happened you imagin the whole thing they
are going to tell us we imagined the
whole thing
but we might have imagined the whole
thing that's actually
possible so I I've got you know the the
two conflicting feelings uh one is
that it's hard for me to imagine so many
people saw so many things and it was a
mass hysteria but that's what makes a
mass hysteria work the reason the mass
Hiser works is that people say things
like I just said well I can't imagine so
many people would be fooled from a
direct
observation yes so many people can be
fooled very easily in a direct
observation um also a little fake news
uh I was one of the people who said hey
Biden's preemptive pardons are crazy
there's so many of them because he had
like over 6,000 of them when other
presidents had a few few hundred and
then somebody said that um no he had
over 8,000 I guess somebody said that
the vast majority of them were people in
jail for weed related offensives is that
true or are most of the volume of the
Biden um pardons or Comm commuting
sentences are those for weed related
things because if they are then I'm okay
with it and and I would say why didn't
Trump do it basically so that might have
been fake news that his pardons were out
of control they might so in the end his
his number of like individual pardons
might be comparable to the past but if
he did a whole bunch of marijuana people
at once I'd call that good I'd say good
for
you um
but um as Jonathan Turley points out if
if Biden is planning a blanket pardon
for his entire Administration
which he might
be um he might do that because he's
afraid of
lawfare
um which he should be and it might
create a situation where every president
can give preemptive pardons to his
entire
Administration which would mean there
would be no accountability whatsoever to
any Administration for anything because
they would just all get
pardoned so we may have we may have
drifted into into a really bad situation
we'll see if we can manage this probably
can but yeah if Biden does literally
preemptive partons for his entire
Administration it's going to be hard to
imagine that Trump wouldn't do the same
thing and then what do you
have anyway apparently the German
government just collapsed with a no
confidence vote and that's not too long
after the French government collapsed
with a no confident that collapsed I
guess and another reports that Justin
Trudeau is considering
resigning why is this all the is this
all the Trump
effect uh did Trump take down three
governments
already because I think maybe he
did and here's
why I think if the other countries look
at America and they say wait what's
Trump doing he's closing the
Border really he's closing your border
he's saving America by closing your
border we need that wait what else is he
doing he's unleashing the energy
production in his country to lower all
their
prices wait we need
that he he's tough on
crime wait we need that he's for free
speech we need that
it might be it's too early to say but it
might be that when people say that Trump
is offering and delivering a a package
of goods that they desperately need
desperately need in the country how
about nuclear power do you think there
are any countries in Europe that are
anti-nuclear power who are looking at us
and saying um they look like they're
going strong into nuclear
power yeah I I think that Trump by
existing and being so right on all the
common sense stuff these are all common
sense things close the border Common
Sense crime Common Sense uh nuclear
energy Common Sense there's no politics
in any of
that and I would imagine that's those
are Universal messages because everybody
likes those things you know they like
more energy if they know the right way
to do
it so maybe other govern other uh other
governments specifically the you know
so-called Democratic countries they
might all fall because they all got woke
they all got under control and watching
America lead and this is America leading
let's let's be clear about that America
doesn't always lead I I think Europe
leads in food safety for example so we
don't lead in everything that's for sure
but we're leading like hell right
now uhum Trump trump
leads like he's really good at it you
know as much as Trump got credit for
being come from
behind kind of you know came out of left
field the first time and then came from
behind the second time the thing he
doesn't get enough credit for is that
once he's secure in his
power he's one cool
cucumber he he is so much in his exact
element where everything he's ever
screamed that he wanted you to believe
you now
believe everything he yelled About You
Now think is just common sense he won
everything he won everything so he's
comfortable and it looks like it and I
think other countries are going to say
give us one of
those you've heard this probably it's
going around on social media but uh
former CIA person Sarah Adams no
relation um says United States is not
ready for the kind of terrorist attacks
that are certainly coming and she says
there'll be swarming
attacks and there are new thinner blowup
vests so you're going to see more people
wearing exploding vests in the United
States and uh that the people were
fighting mostly the radical islamist
types are going to fight until they get
killed because they expect to
die and she says if multiple waves of
these kinds of attacks broke and at the
same time around America we'd be really
unprepared and really in
trouble now I think she is right that
there will be coordinated multi- City
attacks but I still think it's going to
be by
drone and I still worry that it's going
to be a chemical attack because if they
crop dust enough cities at the same time
with any material that looks like it's
dangerous the the country is going to
fall apart because you won't be able to
get out of the city the traffic will be
immediately St it it'll be a mess
so I think that's where it's headed
multiple attacks at the same time some
somewhat like the the October 7 thing so
now you've been
warned i' I would get a gas
mask um if you don't have one that's
that's serious by the way I don't know
where you get one but if you could get a
gas mask that would protect you from any
Airborne
aerosol um
poisons I would get one for each of the
family members and one for the dog
because it's sort of
guaranteed not in your town but it's
kind of guaranteed that somebody's going
to get a drone with some chemical or
biological agents and start sprinkling
it
somewhere
um so I would be equipped for that
uh I wasn't following the Romania thing
but apparently America once again is
trying to control another country
successfully I guess so Romania had an
election and it got
cancelled um because America and NATO
want to build a huge NATO base in
Romania that is pointing right at
Crimea did you know that it would be uh
by a fact of two it would be the biggest
NATO base anywhere would be the biggest
one and if you could imagine imagine the
Black Sea like a like an
oval and then Crimea sort of dangles
down like a
scrotum so Crimea is like the scrotum of
the Black Sea just sort of dangles down
well they want to put this gigantic NATO
base on the left side of the potato
facing the
scrotum H how happy is Russia going to
be if Crimea is is like a short walk
from the biggest NATO base I mean I'm
exaggerating it's not a short walk but
it doesn't look good so apparently we
really need this and so America seems to
have uh beaten away the election
Challenger and now it's a now canell
election so that's
sketchy so the question that I ask about
the neocons and the the plans for Russia
and all that um do we really think we
can defeat Russia
militarily or are we actually trying to
overthrow their entire country
militarily and control it from for the
rest of time are we really doing that
and you know it would sound
crazy except we do this routinely we
just do it with smaller countries like
Romania so but is that the plan is is
the the golden plan to just conquer
Russia and try to fool them into not
using their nukes
somehow so I don't know you know uh I
don't seem probably seem to you like I
speak out against our evil military
Colonial Ambitions and it's because I'm
not sure they're
bad they're evil they're 100%
evil but I don't know if it's bad for
me
because this concept of controlling
other
countries probably works to some extent
doesn't work every
time but you know I've said before if
your country is not expanding is
shrinking there's just no other way to
go you're either growing or you're
shrinking so if this is how we grow by
trying to dominate other countries well
what's the
alternative none of us good I mean the
the whole business of geopolitics is
dirty
business all right colonialism is good
people are saying
all right we should do it with them
being
detected expand or die yeah I think
that's true I think you either expand or
you die it was true of
trump so when Trump was um defeated in
2020 he doubled down he
expanded so expanding Works shrinking
doesn't
well Switzerland is the exception
approves the rule if Switzerland had
anything that anybody wanted it would
already be
conquered can we agree on that if
Switzerland had anything that anybody
important really really wanted it would
already be conquered so swi Switzerland
wins by being the banker for all the bad
guys so the bankers of the bad guys
don't get attacked because the bad guys
do bankers so it's really a special case
you know there there's certainly no
argument uh there's no good argument for
staying um on the lined in the long run
that doesn't work somebody will somebody
will whack
you all right ladies and gentlemen did I
forget anything today I believe I've
covered everything important and that
