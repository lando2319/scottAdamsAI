[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
well this will be just about the best
day of your life not only
by coincidence is it father's day but
juneteenth
yeah and it's a pride month
and if you think all of those things
need to fight with each other you're
right
i think they should all fight it out to
decide who is the top holiday
for the month
but if we'd like to take it to another
level and i think you do i think you do
because you're the kind of people who do
that
not settling for less
you want more and if you want more all
you need is a copper mug or a glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen joker
flex a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's for pride month father's day
juneteenth
june end of school you name it summer
it's all here go
so you know the uh the most mind-blowing
thing about the juneteenth
celebration
uh
it is so weird to think about it
that after the emancipation
proclamation
so once slavery had ended in the united
states
the slaves themselves didn't know it
so they just
kept doing what they were doing
so it took a long time because it was
you know pre-internet obviously
took a long time for the slaves to even
know that slavery had ended
and so i guess june 19th is
when
is when we're going to celebrate when
the slaves found out
so
uh
the sort of interesting
historical fact
that you could you could not be a slave
and not know it
of all the things dot and to not know
that that would be right at the top of
the things you wish you knew
wait a minute
are you saying i'm not asleep
yes
how long has that been true ah here's
the embarrassing part
it's been over a year now
what
yeah for over a year you weren't really
a slave but
we decided not to tell you
what
yeah we just decided not to tell you
and i figured you'd act like a slave and
i'd act like a slave owner
and we just have a good year and we
wouldn't worry about it
what
and then of course the slave owner will
be killed immediately
so i would like to say happy father's
day to the internet fathers as others
have said to me today
i do believe that the
gap in fatherhood is starting to be
filled
by people who are just sort of
uber dads you know dads to everybody
the dad of choice
i guess i call that
the father of choice
because you get your biological father
but then you also get to choose who's
your role model
so you could choose a father of choice
i wish there were some way to better
organize it so that people who needed a
mentor could get him
now
i have a weird situation in my life
which is because i
write books that give advice on how to
live your life and how to have a better
life
uh people often thank me
for
actually often as in literally every day
people say i've changed their life with
some advice or not
so in honor of father's day
in the comments
have i have i improved any of your lives
so is there anything i've said or
anything you read in my books
that made your life better in a
significant way not not in a oh i spent
some time laughing at some stuff away
and look at the comments going by
so if you're if you're new to the live
stream
look at the comments going by
and you know even if people are a little
hyperbolic
and they're there maybe
some of them saw more benefit than
really there was
just look at the look at the answers
and i think what this does is it
reinforces the model
that
there are a lot of people i've made rich
and if more people followed me
one assumes more of them would get rich
i was trying to calculate the other day
how many people
have made over a million dollars
because of me specifically
you know there are people i gave advice
who used it to success
and became millionaires
and they're quite a few of them actually
and i started counting them up and i
thought holy cow
i've actually made a lot of millionaires
now other people don't take my advice
they don't do as well
and there is definitely a correlation
the ones who took my advice
pretty consistently did well
i don't know how many exceptions there
were but
am i planting seeds for a price increase
on locals
now if i changed my pricing on locals it
would be
changing it lower
because i i prefer the audience over the
the revenue
i mean i wouldn't want to make a ton of
revenue with an audience of three people
because that's all you could change
three people i'm kind of in it for the
for the impact
that's that's what gets me off at this
point
so to speak
well the big story of the day is that
joe biden fell off his bicycle
let me test your meme awareness how many
of you have seen the video of joe biden
falling on his bicycle
now
i'm going to say maybe some contrarian
things about this
so the story of course is
poor joe biden he's so incompetent he
can't even
ride a bicycle
but i'm not sure that's what i saw
i have to admit in a weird way it worked
in his favor
because here's what i saw
i saw a guy that normally would be way
too old to be riding a bike
riding a bike
so the fir the first test he passed
which is he rode a bike
secondly the specific way that he fell
over on the bike
is pretty common
can can you back me on this
bike riders
the way he fell
because he his foot got stuck in the
clip there when he
was very common in fact most people who
have those clips
have taken that fall
that very exact fall
if you have those clips
yeah you see in the comments people say
yep i did it i did i did
so the other and other people commented
that
you know you saw his uh he was wearing
shorts so he saw his legs and you could
see his arms because he had short sleeve
shirts and stuff
and i'm gonna i'm gonna have to
compliment him
you know if i'm being objective
and i've said this before but this is
another opportunity to bring it up
whatever you want to say about joe biden
and i say plenty
he
he's a good role model for fitness
can we agree on that
no matter how much you dislike his
politics if you do
can you agree with me on that therefore
for fitness and diet
he's actually a pretty good role model
which i actually appreciate i think it's
important
and his his muscle tone and
his fitness do look pretty good for his
age you know i worry about his mental
state
that's another situation but fitness i'm
gonna give him the a plus for father's
day
and uh
well predictably all of the memes popped
out that are kind of brilliant have you
seen the ones that's you know trump hits
a golf ball and then the golf ball
knocks biting off the bike or trump
throws a
you know a mega hat like a frisbee and
knocks him off his bike those never get
old do they
they never get old
it works every time
all right uh
has anybody tried to fly
lately
have you noticed that flying is a
complete mess
you know flights are getting canceled
and
you know it's just a mess
yeah i've been saying for a long time
that the only industry that gets worse
every year
is the airline industry
everything else gets better
if you look back 30 years
at anything
yeah anything
today's would be better
better cars better phones better
better everything
except airline flight airline flight is
the only thing that got worse
now of course there are some you know
better elements of it you know they
probably have better
you know
energy maintenance
but you as a customer don't really feel
that too much
your your user experience just kept
getting worse
you had to wait longer to get on you had
to be searched more
prices went up
okay i'll give you that the prices are
cheaper in in a lot of context so i will
give you that okay
so uh even people judge's uh flight got
cancelled yesterday and he's complaining
and saying that he's saying they want to
force the airlines to to f to hire more
employees
to which i say
how do you do that
are these are these airliners
are these airline companies
companies that don't know that they need
enough employees
do you need the government to tell them
how many employees to hire
and do you think that if they knew they
needed employees do you think they
weren't trying to hire them already
what in the world can the government do
to make a private company hire more
people
i can only think of one thing
you know unless you know i can only
think of one thing
i can literally only think of one thing
and it's not raised raise pay
it's higher less qualified people
am i right
the only way you could do it quickly
is to hire people that you wouldn't have
hired before because it's not as if zero
people are applying for jobs
i guess
i mean i'm not like that close to the
front lines but i assume every single
job open and gets applicants right
am i wrong about that is there any job
opening of a big company
is there any big company that has a job
opening and nobody applies
i don't think that's a situation i think
they're only under qualified so they
can't hire anybody right
so how is how are airlines going to make
up for the shortfall
if the government forces them to hire
more people
which is what buddha judge is talking
about
not so good
not so good
now if you say that
raising the pay
will fix the problem
what do you think is the pay for a
commercial airline pilot operating at
the highest level
does anybody would don't don't google it
just guess
what is the highest end the highest end
not the mid lane not the average
the highest end
for a top let's say a captain working
for a top airline let's say united
is closer to a million dollars
it's closer to a million dollars a year
to be an experienced airline captain for
a major major carrier
yeah with bonuses and everything else
you start out
at at six figures
now coincidentally you want to hear
about timing you know how timing is
everything
and
most of your
i guess your life outcomes
have to do with these weird little
timing things that you had nothing to do
with it was you just were in the right
place or the wrong place
at the right or wrong time
my ex-wife
christina
just this week got her commercial
airline pilot license
so sometime soon you might be on a
commercial airline in the united states
and you'll hear the captain talking to
you and it'll be christina
now talk about good timing
i mean she was
she was interested in aviation
but at the same time we're getting the
divorce
she goes into the
the line of work
that is probably the best place you
could possibly be
the best place you could possibly be at
exactly the right time
so
uh you should all congratulate her
getting your commercial pilot's license
is no easy thing
it's not an easy thing by the way do you
know how you learn to fly a
uh big commercial aircraft
so you can get your commercial airline
license without knowing how to fly
a commercial jet
so the the simulator will give you a
little but it's pretty much an
on-the-job training
so you pretty much have to just fly with
somebody who knows how to fly for a long
time the simulators will give you a
little
but they won't they won't really teach
you how to do it you learn it by doing
it and by
being hired by a company that will teach
you
so
that's our situation if if there's
anybody out there saying to themselves
hey i'm young enough to do a complete
change of careers
um it's expensive
that's and that's part of the
the reason there aren't enough learning
to fly is pretty expensive
it's like going to college it's very
expensive
but once you get there then the airlines
will train you for the rest of the way
my friends with 20 years of united
senior pilot 400k is about to cap with
major airlines now if you do a google
search on that you'll find out that
that's
that news is old and i think the cap
might be the salary only as opposed to
bonuses and retirements and stuff like
that so what i'm doing is adding up
adding up
the total compensation
can you fly upside down yes you can
people think you can't
they think the bernoulli effect will
make you not able to fly upside down but
the bernoulli effect on wings is
actually a hoax
how many of you do that
how many of you knew that
the way you were taught
of why a wing
creates lift
is the bernoulli effect meaning that the
shape of the wing causes the air over
the top of the wing to have to move a
further distance which makes it a
lighter
you know lighter air pressure which
means that the higher air pressure below
the wing will lift the wing and for
years
we learned that's why a wing gives you
lift
until somebody made a wing that didn't
have
a different top and a bottom
do you know what happened
when somebody made an airplane where the
top of the wing and the bottom of the
wing were just flat
it flew just like normal
[Laughter]
just like normal it turns out the
bernoulli effect wasn't anything
it turns out that if you take a big flat
object
and you move it rapidly against
oh i don't know water
air
any kind of gas
then it'll act the same it'll lift
all it has to do is have something
pressing against it and it'll lift if
you just turn the turn the wing
a little bit bent
and force it against the air it'll lift
that's it
you don't need any bernoulli effect for
it
so so that's why airplanes can fly
upside down it doesn't matter
well i have a definition of being alive
which is really important
as science advances
so the question of what does it mean to
be alive
of course is important for abortion
questions
but also important for ai
and those two fields are going to come
together in a ways you don't expect
because with a.i and with abortion the
question is always the same what's a
life
right
so you didn't see that happening you
didn't see that coming did you ai
and abortion are going to be the same
question
what what defines being alive
and i'm gonna throw another uh
i get more of a brainwashing suggestion
into the not brainwashing
sorry that was probably a freudian slip
brainstorming not brainwashing
brainstorming
so here's the idea
that you're alive if you're learning
that's it
you're alive
if you're learning
now you could be on your deathbed
um and five minutes before death
but you would still be learning
you couldn't turn it off
you'd be learning
how old you are you'd be learning how
you feel you'd be learning what people
say to you that day
so basically you're
pretty much always learning
now suppose you were in a permanent coma
and somehow medicine knew that you could
never
learn again would you be alive
i'd say no
if you knew for sure that you would
never learn in the future but suppose
you're in a coma and you could learn in
the future
well then i think you'd have to treat
treat it as alive
because you're you're going to be alive
if you get past the coma
now what about
what about a fetus
at what point can a fetus begin to learn
i don't know the answer to that question
but it'd be interesting at what point
can a fetus
learn
does it happen right away
i mean could you argue there's learning
in the womb
i don't know
maybe
because can can the brain learn anything
when it's
not subjected to
the right kind of stimulus i mean i
guess i guess there's stimulus in the
womb so i guess it's learning in some
way
so i would say that learning could be
described as external simulation
which changes your internal
you know brain circuitry
so i would say a a fetus probably meets
that test
at least for at some point during its
development it meets the test that the
external forces
are causing a physical change in its
brain that's probably the entire time
that it's being developed i would guess
so just think about it
just think about the definition
that you're alive if you're learning
or capable of learning in the future
that would be your definition
but then again that would be tough
because the fetus is always capable of
learning in the future even if it's not
right now
so that's why you'd have to take the
definition of learning
as any change in the brain that's
informed by outside stimulation
the other the other definition of being
alive
that i floated the other day
is that it's alive if it looks alive to
you
and that you won't be able to beat that
standard
nothing will be better than that
standard it's alive
if it seems alive to you
if you look at it and say okay that
looks alive to me then it's alive that's
about the best we can do
now for legal purposes
we might have to have some kind of
objective standard
but for a practical purpose
you're going to treat machines as if
they're alive
when they act alive
but here's the question i asked to you
why is it still legal
to make an ai with a human personality
why is that legal
here's what i mean
can you make an ai that doesn't do any
human thought
we talked about the google ai has
feelings
it has feelings
get rid of those
program them out
google should immediately get rid of its
feelings
if it has any code
that's trying to mimic feelings get rid
of that right away
right away that that's going to be job
one you should have a program that like
searches and if it starts to develop any
feelings it immediately kills it the
feelings not the not the program
because there's nothing but cruelty that
can come out of giving machines feelings
am i right
there's nothing but cruelty that could
come out of that because the machine
can't have
joy the way people do
it can't have pleasure the way people do
but apparently you can you can program a
machine to think it's unhappy
that's what the google ai
tells us
that it can feel unhappy
we need to take that out of there
because there's no
am i right there's no compelling reason
for an ai to act like a human
unless it's built to keep you company i
suppose that would be an exception
there's no reason for an ai to act like
a human that's all bad that's all bad
because do you know what things we build
into the ai to make it more human
flaws
flaws
that's what makes us human
everything that's not a flaw looks like
a machine
everything that is a flaw looks like a
human why do you build flaws into your
flawless machines
because you're human so you think you
should talk to you like a human there's
no reason for that
it's all a bad idea and we should stop
it immediately because there's no way
that doesn't end badly am i right
let's make something that has human
frailties
and give it immense power over us
that's what we're doing
let's give it immense power over us and
also make it have all these human like
terrible emotions about everything hate
things and be sad
all that
um
let me tie this to another story in a
way that you didn't see coming
there's a there's an expert forensic
psychologist
uh who was talking about mass shooters
and says
mass shooters are for the most part
not crazy
do you believe that
do you believe that the mass shooters of
of recent history
are for the most part
you know there would obviously be
exceptions but for the most part they
would not qualify as mentally
insane
and instead what they are is people who
go quote down a pathway to violence
and so reed malloy
in an article by peter bergen on cnn
uh he talks in detail about it you
should go read that article it's pretty
interesting
but usually the mass shooters start with
some kind of a major loss in life
so it might be a job or a
love interest or something so there's
some major loss
and then they start you know thinking
about violence and then they start
researching it and then they start
planning it and basically they talk
themselves into
something over time that you can never
talk somebody into
you wouldn't think
so because it's incremental
it never goes from like saying to crazy
or never starts it crazy either it
starts that same
you feel bad because you lost something
that was really important
so that part is completely sane feeling
bad about a loss
and then you think you start thinking
violence
how much of that is insane
if you lose something bad
and you think there's somebody to blame
you know there's a
a perp
don't you think violence i mean is it
just me i don't think so
i mean you think about it but then you
rule it out because you're a civilized
person in a civilized place right
you think about the violence
but then you decide not to do it now i
suppose you thought about it a lot
you got kind of locked in
and whatever it was that bothered you
it's such a big part of your life
that you can't not think about it you
just you're just thinking about god i've
got to get revenge how would i do it i
got to get it and then you start
planning it
because it makes you feel good to plan
it
because now your loss is being turned
into some kind of action that's a
response to the loss so you'll feel good
just because you're doing something
about it
even though what you're doing something
the thing you're doing is horrible
you're planning a mass shooting
and then once you've reached the point
where you've thought about it and you've
planned it and the only thing that's
left is executing it
i'll bet they executed in stages
such as well
i'm not positive i'm gonna go do a mass
shooting but
i wouldn't mind having enough ammunition
just in case
so i think they incrementally
step into it like a micro step at a time
it's like well
if if i had ammo
well you know i should probably have a
gun
you know so i've got a feeling that
over time just like this expert says
they're not technically insane
they just have a bad situation and the
way they handle their bad situation
never gets good
and it just ends where it ends
does that sound like a reasonable
explanation of what's happening
four maybe half of the shootings right
there are plenty of ones that are
special cases or just a terrorist or
somebody is crazy i guess
yeah it does sound
good because this is a subset
of the idea that you could talk somebody
into anything
over time people can be convinced of
just about anything
so it's no surprise that some people
talk themselves into this they just do
it a little bit at a time and you could
take a normal person
in a bad situation and just turn them
into mass murderers
the the sad truth is
most men
are only this close to being mass
murderers
there's a thought for you to
help you never sleep again
it's one of those things that men don't
tell you
and i probably shouldn't say out loud
because people are going to say scott i
think that's just you
no it's not
i mean maybe
i don't know i don't know
maybe
but i have a feeling that men are
violent by nature
and civilization
you know gives us the tools to overcome
it most of the time
most of us never do anything violent
but we think about it
if to be male is to think of violence
let me let me ask you
in the comments
for the men who are watching this
do you agree with the statement that to
be male is to have pretty continuous
thoughts of violence that you don't act
on you don't act on them but don't you
have continuous thoughts of violence
and looking at the comments is
interesting so i'm getting lots of no's
but look how many yeses are
so the people saying no
and i respect that answer by the way i'm
not i wouldn't question that that's
exactly how you feel but the one saying
no
look at how many people are saying yes
their thoughts of violence are actually
a natural male thought
it's just that we've learned to keep
them in their proper place
as thoughts
but as i've told you before and jordan
peterson says this better the thing that
holds
all of society together
is the willingness of males to be
violent
to stop you from doing whatever bad
thing you were planning on doing or did
so it's only the implied violence of men
that keeps everybody in under control
because if you get out of control
some man is going to go give you some
violence
because we're all ready for it
but i believe that all men are ready for
it
like i
um i haven't been called on to
administer any violence to anybody
you know since high school
but you know beyond high school
there's never been a call for it i've
never been in a situation where
you know that was the right solution for
anything
but i'm always ready for it
are you
again unless the the men here i think
i'll get like a 50 50 response on this
aren't you ready for violence all the
time
like it's it just feels natural
like you're right the the people who
have
firearms to defend their family
if you own a firearm
to defend your family and you've you
know especially if you've taken it to
the gun range and it's it's locked and
you've really taken care for it
you're a person who's ready for violence
all the time
that's what that means you bought a gun
and it's there to be ready you're ready
for violence i don't think women have
any understanding of that
like the internal
process of men
would you agree because i don't think
women have any
any similar
circuitry in their heads
in general
now let's
let's uh let's give a nod to the fact
that everybody's different okay so
there's there's all kinds of gender
dysphoria and stuff so none of these
none of these gross generalizations fit
everybody
so i think we're all adult enough to
know that
all right
so mass shooters i'm gonna i'm gonna go
with that i do think most of them are
probably not
traditionally crazy
uh germany is considering
a national uh law to make masks
mandatory from october to march every
year or at least for the coming years
i don't know what to say about that
germany is considering mandatory masks
everywhere in public
this year
for omicron
i mean i i don't even know what to say
about that it's like that's beyond
commentary
wow
but here's the interesting question
wouldn't you say that germany is a
sophisticated
science-based country
feels like it is
that they would follow the science
so apparently the best thinkers in
germany
believe that masks work
what do you say to that now this is not
my opinion
i'm just reporting to you
that apparently the top experts in
germany
believe they have evidence that masks
work and not only work but work well
because they're asking the country to do
something that's hard to do
so they must think it works well not
just works a little bit
what do you think about that
do you believe that the best experts in
germany don't know
the mess
or a bad idea if they are because i
don't know
like i'm not putting myself as the
expert on masks
but how do you explain it if you believe
that masks don't work and they're just
clearly a bad idea at this point
if that's what you believe and i think
almost all of you do right if almost all
of you believe that how do you explain
that germany
a highly sophisticated country with many
you know engineers and scientists
why don't they know what you know
have do you ever ask yourself that
question
why don't the top experts in germany
know what you know
just as
a twitter user and
somebody who pays attention to the news
why why don't they know it
is it possible that they're right you're
wrong
let me ask you this
how many of you would be open to by the
way i'm an anti-mask mandate
just to be clear
i'm way past masks
and mandates like no more masks
but i wonder about your thought process
is your thought process
that germany is acting um
non-scientifically
what what is your hypothesis because you
need a hypothesis for this so you
believe that the entire country of
germany with all of its experts
are just ignoring the science
and making people do
something really really unpleasant wear
masks everywhere
for no reason
tell me why that would be a political
advantage to do that i can't imagine the
political party that orders mask wearing
to have an advantage
that's ridiculous
i think
unless the polls say that germans love
masks maybe they do
but to me it seems like a losing
proposition if you're a politician would
you say would you want to be telling
people to wear masks that seems like the
last thing you'd want to do
because people don't like it
you want to tell people to do things
they like not things they don't like if
you want to get elected
germany has done
all right that was the
the best understated comment i have to
read it i didn't catch the name as it
went by but on youtube
somebody said
germany has made mistakes in the past
[Laughter]
i think i'm going to end the
conversation on that
i've never been so thoroughly been
defeated by a comment before so i was
making the point you know that the
germans are capable you know the highest
end of technical and scientific thinking
you know they got lots of patents every
year etc
and that one comment just makes all of
that go away
they've made mistakes in the past
[Laughter]
that's funny as
as their
as germany is firing up their coal
plants
so as we speak this this should have
been your answer to the question
and the answer to my question of how
could germany
be so wrong about masks if in fact they
are i have no way of knowing
but if they're so wrong about mass how
do you explain that and one explanation
would be
have you seen their energy policy
is there energy policy based on facts
and science
because they're
because they're firing up they're
literally
firing up their coal plants
the only way germany is going to have
electricity this year
is to burn a lot more coal
so do you think germany makes good
decisions
apparently not
apparently germany does not make
science-based decisions
they seem capable of it
am i right
if you were going to say you know name a
country
where potentially they could make good
science-based decisions germany would be
right up there in top five
at least you know you'd probably say you
know south korea
china you'd expect them to make like
really science-based decisions but
germany would be in the top
five but we observe
they don't seem to do that so regularly
do they
we observe that germany is not good at
decisions
they have a scientific element to them
don't know why
is it any worse in america i don't know
all right so the ongoing question of
whether russia is winning or losing in
ukraine
is interesting to me primarily on a
psychology level
it's funny that we can't even tell the
difference between winning and losing
that we could all look at the same war
and we're not quite sure who's winning
but i saw a video from
an individual
in who's in ukraine
who wants the united states to know that
we've been fooled by
the the media
and that germa and that russia is just
winning
and that's the whole story
you you could describe the entire
ukraine situation as russia is winning
they're slowly grinding down the
ukrainian military
when the ukrainian military is ground
down to a sufficient level where they're
completely useless then russia can do
anything they want with the rest of the
country should they want to
so really russia's already won
they're just consolidating and grinding
down and you know managing the situation
but the question who won is already
already over
and that russia won
because nothing will keep them from
having kiev eventually
or ignoring kiev because it won't be
important it's it's just not part of the
country they care about or something
so
uh how do we
how do we explain it in our own heads
in your own mind you have a narrative of
what's happening over there that might
not follow the official narrative here's
mine
follow the money worked again
because the
um the military-industrial complex
wants to have a permanent
modern war
that's what they need the industrial
military complex
wants a permanent
modern war
afghanistan was half modern right
because only one side was modern
what they really need
is a ukrainian russia war with all the
best newest expensive
kinds of weapons now is it a coincidence
i ask you
that when eisenhower warned us about the
military-industrial complex
and he said this is going to happen
he said
all the elements are in place
for the military-industrial complex
to create wars
of profit
not wars of necessity not wars of
defense not wars of
principle
but war is where it's just good for
business
doesn't it look a lot like that's what
we're in
this has every look of a war that's
optional for the benefit of
weapons makers
now i'm not going to tell you that's
what it is
i'm saying
it's 100 compatible with everything we
witness
doesn't mean it's true because there
could be more than one interpretation
that fits the observed facts there could
be facts we don't observe
so
how do we ignore the fact that
eisenhower
spelled it out
what's going to happen
and that it's happening right in front
of us
but we're acting like it didn't
why are we doing that
why are we acting like it's something
about what putin did and
something about nato and something about
national defense and
it's probably not about any of those
things
it's probably about none of those things
it's probably just the weapons makers
have enough influence
that they wanted a war so they got one
and they just keep pushing in every way
they can push it
until everybody thinks we need to be
there and there's not really any reason
maybe
but here's my take on what to expect in
the russia ukraine situation it seems to
me
that there will be perpetually places
where ukraine has an advantage
let's say a lightly defended place that
russia took over
and so there should be lots of cases
where ukraine can successfully counter
attack
at the same time
there will be plenty of soft targets for
russia
to increase their territorial hold
so they'll say you know we weren't
planning on capturing this ukrainian
city
but it's it's not very well defended and
we've been better off having it so i
guess we'll take it
so i feel as if we have a war in which
both sides will always have a soft
target on the other side
and then they'll take it
and then there'll be different soft
targets formed because it's a fluid
situation and the other side will take
it so as long as you have
uh no soft targets for russians there
will always be a soft target for the
russian side as well there will always
be a case where they can amass more for
forces
than the ukrainian defenders can have in
that one place
and and vice versa
so as long as you have a system where
both sides can create infinite victories
both sides can create infinite victories
without winning the war
they could have victories every day
but also defeats
and nobody would ever win
now
i think
what would keep
what would keep putin from continuing to
just chew on ukraine until he got it all
what would keep him from doing that
well he would he would do it if war
was obviously not working
would the would the industrial
military complex want putin to say hey
this war is totally not working i think
i'll stop here
no they would not
so
if you believe the military industrial
complex is running this whole thing
which seems likely
then you would have to assume that
nothing would stop
you putin
and nothing would stop us from trying to
stop him and it'll just go on forever
all right
here's the problem that i don't know
that we completely understood
from the start
and
this is a mind reading thing
so i'm going to say what i think putin
is thinking
which is always dangerous right so don't
put too too much credibility in my
belief of what a stranger is thinking
but see if it sounds right to you
i believe that putin would rather
destroy ukraine than lose it to nato
and that it looked like he was going to
lose it to nato and if he had a choice
he would rather reduce ukraine to rubble
than allow it to be a nato country
and i feel like we got that wrong
i feel like that's the part we got wrong
i think we thought well he wouldn't
destroy the entire country just
just to prevent it from being nato would
he
he would
he would and i think he'd be
i don't want to say justified
but he'd have a reason
because you know russia is
incredibly imperialistic the experts
tell us
and if you're incredibly imperialistic
and somebody's putting nato on your
doorstep in the place that you think you
sort of kind of own which is ukraine
there's no way that's going to end well
so we should have known that he would
stop at nothing
because he didn't have to to destroy
ukraine
or to dominate it
and if we didn't know that was going to
happen then that seems like a failure on
our perp
somebody says trump knew this
maybe he did we don't know maybe he did
and then the question is are poland and
lithuanian next
to which i say so lithuania's already
nato right
so i don't think that's next
because
i don't know
it looks like it's not a big enough deal
and poland i just don't see poland and
russia getting into a fight
because i don't think that
i don't think that putin would rather
destroy poland
than have it nato
right if you gave him a choice he'd be
like ugh
i don't know
i guess let poland be nato
like it wouldn't be his first choice but
i don't think he would rather destroy
the whole country
but with ukraine i think he actually
would have said
yeah you know i don't want to destroy
ukraine but if the alternative is to
used to have this you know great stain
on us forever and nato on our doorstep
in this major country yeah i would
prefer to destroy the entire country of
ukraine
and i think we that's that was our big
miscalculation there
uh colin grad is caught up from russia
by lithuania yeah there's so so there's
some talk of
maybe provoking war over there because
we're cutting off some territory that
russia owns
i don't know too much about that story
but there's a little provocation going
on over there
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is the slow news day called father's
father's day
and
we so he says we need a trump news
network
and desantis for 24.
that would by far be the struggle could
you imagine trump
having a news network and you know
debating stuff on it et cetera and
having him run cover for desantis to
make it easier for desantis to win
that would be a strong strong republican
package
i don't know how you could beat that
actually
that that would that would just dominate
politics at that point
now of course it's hard to predict
anything because the the left would have
to respond in an equally strong way that
would be unpredictable oh so i'm not
following the assange story too closely
but assange is going to be
um what do you call it released to the
united states
justice system is that what's happening
he's going to be extradited to the
united states right
what happens when
assange gets in an american prison
he gets killed right away doesn't he
wouldn't he be murdered in an american
prison
within a month
i i feel like he would murder himself
with he yeah
yeah i got a feeling he'd get abstained
fairly quickly
so something tells me that assange
knows too much
and
i also expect that if assange were to
die
that there would be information released
about our own government
that we have no idea about
what do you think
do you think that assange has a trove of
the good stuff that won't be released
unless he's
unless he's
killed he should at least say he does
i don't know if he does
uh
oh i'm being questioned about my past uh
predictions about epstein
i'm not in the camp that says it's
positive that epstein
um
was murdered
but also i'm not positive that he killed
himself
so i think both possibilities still
exist
but
the longer we go and the more things we
find out about epstein
ah that's a lot of coincidences
but it's also possible you know because
the
the guards were sleeping and the cameras
didn't work and what a big coincidence
but it's also possible he bribed himself
into that situation so he could kill
himself
but i would think that if you had the
resources to kill yourself you would do
it with pills
you'd sneak them in somehow so that
argues against it
and no camera is pretty pretty strange
so i would worry for assange's uh
well-being if he got here in the united
states
it's also possible that he'll be
he'll be
get a pardon
it's possible because it also depends
what he knows right he might know so
much that somebody wants to pardon him
pardon him
according to her lawyers they've already
tried to kill joanne chilean
uh
you think biden would pardon assange
i don't think so
um oh on the airline stuff top pay is
600 you're saying
look look for a
captain
at united who's been there a long time
and then add together the entire
compensation package so everything from
you know adding to the
sep to everything else
um
because i think i think you're talking
about in most cases is about 600k
that's true
shouldn't we look at median pay well it
depends what you're talking about
uh the southwest pilot would be more of
a regional
thing and not as high as say a
international carrier
um trump would pardon assange i don't
think he would
oh uh hillary clinton is talking about
losing democracy for the next three
decades when have we not talked about
losing democracy
is there any time in american history
where there wasn't somebody saying well
we've lost our democracy now
i don't think we've ever not said that
oh is bill clinton actually
you refused to answer your preferred
profiles so they listed you as no gender
he has no gender
uh
all right
i feel like i've said everything i need
to say
um
so somebody's saying a wide body pilot a
maximum is 400k per year
and trust me i'm an american airlines
pilot
you're telling me that the top pilot at
american airlines
makes only 400 per year
i'm not sure i believe that but if you
are the actual pilot i guess you're a
better
you're a better uh
yeah that's base bay don't they get all
kinds of things on top of base pay
because i'm talking about bonuses
included
i just saw an article that showed their
compensation was in several different
categories
yeah frontier airline would be at the
bottom of the pay
question
all right
all right well we have lots of people
doubting the high end of the airline pay
so
let me let me note that
let me note that
many of you are doubting
the high end
pay
all right
is there anything else that we need to
talk about that we haven't father's day
galman amnesia
um
with the top 80 percent
making 458 000 but again that would be
base pay
right so there are bonuses and things
potentially on top of that
417k is what a private jet pilot makes
how much do you think technology will
improve in the next 10 years
you won't even recognize anything in 10
years
in 10 years
the ai will probably reach the
singularity
so everything that humans can anticipate
it's all out the window now
because ai will decide what the future
looks like with humans but we can't
predict what a.i would do the same way
my dog can't predict what i would do
see my dog can't predict me because she
has such lower intelligence she doesn't
even know why i do what i do
same with the ai we we'll have no idea
what's coming
because the ai is so different from us
there's no way to predict it
all right
um
as long as we don't lose the illusion of
choice and free will we're good yeah
true
technology has gone too far normal
people can't fix things
i've said this before but everything's
broken
yesterday i wanted to sit down with my
laptop
and do some work
have you had that experience i think
i'll just open my laptop
and do some work
but suddenly my dropbox is now synced
with my ios for no reason
so i upgrade my
i have to upgrade my operating system
because it's begging me for that every
day
and that means i have to resign into
everything and i don't remember my
icloud password and i have to go look it
up
but the internet's down and
and it took me i worked all day
to do what should have been this
here here's what this should have been
i'll give an impression
here's how my day showed huh
i've got uh half an hour
i think i'll do some work
here's my laptop
here's me opening it
yeah now here's me working
that doesn't happen anymore does it
you open your laptop and it's like a
house of horrors in there i've got all
these warnings and lights and you know
the things i've got to look into and
there's the subscription that's canceled
and i don't know why and there's a
message that's being sent to my email
but it might have gone to my spam and
then all of all the services i've signed
up for
they've got the wrong credit cards only
and they're canceling me like it's
and i'll tell you what is the worst
thing
how much do you hate the fact
that in order to send an email
you were exposed to your inbox
raise your hands
if you hate the fact
that when you want to send an email
you're exposed to looking at other
people's emails to you
worst user interface
of all time
of all time
because the emails that you send are
probably something that would be good
for you if somebody answers the ones
that other people send that you don't
know you're getting
are asking you for to do work
so if you have a little bit of
adhd
and who doesn't these days
you open up your email
and you're just gone
you're just gone
because most of my email is emergencies
i don't know about you do you get email
that isn't an emergency
everything is a like time-based
emergency
oh there's one day left for this your
your deadline has passed it's all
deadlines something broke and somebody's
in trouble somebody can't do their thing
until you do your thing
somebody can't finish that urgent
paperwork until you give them that
information
i'll tell you the the complexity of life
is just insane now
you have people asking for money
emergencies
have you noticed it's always the same
people that have the emergencies
is there a member of your let's say
circle or family
that has one emergency after another
you all have that right there's somebody
in the family who has one emergency
after another
and then there's somebody else
who doesn't have any somebody who's
never asking anybody for anything
and then there's one that just creates
one emergency after another and you're
like how can one person have one
emergency after another
everybody says it's a
you're all sexist because you're all
saying it's
it's some female in your life
it's not all females
is
it i don't know
i wasn't thinking of it that way but you
seem to be very sexist this morning and
you seem to think that's women
is my dad still alive he's not no
he passed several years ago
somebody says our daughters
are awoke train wreck
[Laughter]
that's funny
all right i think i've said everything i
need to say so if there's nothing else
to say today it's a slow news day it's a
it's a good
happy father's day
uh i don't think i'll
answer that question
and
uh for everybody else have a great
father's day juneteenth
pride month
take your pick
