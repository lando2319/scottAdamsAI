I have to warn you to lower your
expectations today
I don't normally I tell you this is the
highlight of civilization the best thing
that ever happened to you
but today
honestly
it's still the best thing that's ever
going to happen to you
and I don't have anything today
do I know what's going to happen today
nope
no idea
will I fall asleep right in front of you
good chance good chance
yes I woke up this morning and uh I
looked at the shades
and there was something that wasn't
supposed to be happening on the other
side of those Shades do you know what it
was
something that never happens to me when
I'm waking up
yeah there was light out
I don't wake up when the lights out
if the Sun beats me up I've done
something terribly wrong
but how do we get things on track easy
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker jealous of Stein a canteen
jugular flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
I almost forgot what I like there
um uh enjoy me now
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better
and boy do I need it today it's called
the simultaneous sip
go
ah
yeah that was good
I was just asked if I could explain how
hypnosis works
anybody want to hear that how hypnosis
works
how does it work
would you like to be hypnotized excuse
me
so
there are two ways to hypnotize people
broadly speaking
a lot of what I say about hypnosis will
be things that other people would not
say
I don't know why but everybody might
just have their own take about how to
describe this thing that can't be
described
one kind of hypnosis you it's one person
working with one person and you tell
that person to relax and sit in a
comfortable place and
um maybe even close your eyes or you
might have them close their eyes during
the hypnosis the other kind is where
you're just talking to somebody
the kind I'm doing right now
do you think I could hypnotize you
just by talking to you on this live
stream
what do you think
do you think I can hypnotize you without
you knowing you had been hypnotized
of course
but of course there's a definitional
thing right
so as long as I don't say you're getting
sleepy and
you know put a little watch in front of
you and swing it back and forth you
would say to yourself that's not
hypnosis
that's just you being persuasive
and you would be correct that's exactly
what it is
so you can think of it as a Continuum
from most persuasive to least
but what does it what's the difference
between just talking to somebody
and focusing an actual hypnotic
session
and the difference is probably Focus
and that's about it
if I'm if I'm trying to influence you
verbally
some of the times you're talking
well that's no good
I don't need to hear you talking it
should be more about me when a hypnotist
is working with a subject the subject
doesn't do any talking typically and the
hypnotist does it all they also don't
have any other distractions
so it's just the two of you in the room
typically you don't want to have you
know an audience
and so what you get when two people are
doing it and that's all they're doing is
the focus
and it also feels like it's more
important
which turns out to be
an important variable to hypnosis
if you came to get hypnotized by me
and I said all right we're going to do
it in the living room here let's go sit
on the couch and I'll hypnotize you it
would work
that would work
but
suppose you came to my office there was
a hypnotist office
and there was like a proper office you
know in a big building it's got a maybe
a receptionist
and you go into a room and it's obvious
that this is the hypnosis facility
and then I come in I've got like a
doctor's outfit on or maybe a suit
and I'm all professional
could I hypnotize you then
yes and it would be easier because once
I'd set up the situation
you would be hypnotized before you
walked in you talk yourself into it you
would basically
be pre-hypnotized before you walked in
the door and we learned that as
hypnotists you learn you learn to create
an environment where the person talks
themselves into it
very important it's a big part of the
process in fact there's something called
the pre-talk
where you talk to somebody before you do
the hypnosis to tell them what to expect
and by telling them what to expect
it it sort of keeps them out of the
Curiosity mode and lets them just be in
the moment
otherwise you're just thinking what's
going to happen now what am I going to
do does it feel different you'll have
lots of questions and those would be
distracting
so I answer the questions in advance I'm
going to do that now
the number one question people ask is
um can I be hypnotized
a lot of people say I don't think I
could be hypnotized and a lot of people
say there was that one person to try
that it didn't work
you can all be hypnotized
you can all be hypnotized there's no
exceptions
there's an exception in terms of How
Deeply
and what level you can go to but there
are no exceptions
if you're willing if you're not willing
or let's say you're mentally insane or
something that would be harder if you're
drunk that's hard right but if you're
just a normal person who is willing and
you're willing to spend the time and
just sit there in a relaxed State yeah
it works every time
now it doesn't work every time to the
maximum amount
so it'd be like going to the gym
does going to the gym work
what would you say does going to the gym
work
well not for everybody all right some
people go twice they do the arm thing
where they're pedaling with an arm
because they don't want to stand up and
that's the last time they go so so if
you say that does hypnosis work it's
very much like saying does going to the
gym work
well
sort of yes for everyone who is serious
about it
but if you're not so serious about
actually going to the gym and you're not
so serious about actually trying to
experience hypnosis it will it won't
happen
about 20 percent of people
can experience What's called the
phenomenon
and I love that that's the name for it
so we had to just call it that sometimes
the phenomenon now the phenomenon is
when you can actually just see and hear
things that aren't there
most people can do that to some extent
for example the most common type of
induction is once I add you completely
relaxed and once I had convinced you
that something was happening I could get
to that later but there's a point where
you convince the person that you're
hypnotizing that something's happening
that's an important part of the process
they have to feel wait a minute I think
something's happening
foreign
you get that something happening thing
and then you you build on it
so they you get the person to talk
themselves into it essentially
let me back up to that and tell you how
that works
there's a part in formal hypnosis that
does not apply to just talking to people
that I call the magic trick
so there's part that's just you know
purely exactly what you see there's no
tricks to it at all you know if I'm
talking to you saying you're relaxed or
whatever that's exactly what I'm saying
and it's exactly what I mean
there's one exception
it's the magic trick
and the magic trick
is where you were convinced that what is
happening is because of the hypnotists
and it might not be
but it usually is
it just doesn't matter
for example I'm going to do it to you
right now
so if anybody doesn't want to be
hypnotized a little bit
you should turn off your device right
now or go in the other room or something
right I'm going to give you the smallest
smallest little hypnotic suggestion
it won't work for everybody
but it will work for some of you
some of you would work right away some
of it will take a little while some will
be a big effect some small effect
[Music]
excuse me
oh I overslept
now typically
typically with let's say hundreds of you
watching
probably if hundreds are watching maybe
three or four of you
just had to yawn
did anybody have to yawn or fight a yawn
just then anybody
did you feel any any
little uh draw yeah okay so some of it
was something you did
so here's the other lesson of hypnosis
there's no such thing as everybody
acting the same
so a big part of why you have to do it
in person and why it doesn't work as
well if it's in your recorded form or in
written form is you have to look for the
feedback
if I know it's working I say oh that
worked and then I'll build on it if it
doesn't work then I have to go back and
get a magic trick that does so the yawn
was a magic trick it's not one that's
used in hypnosis by the way no no
hypnotist uses a yawn I just did that
because it was easy I knew it would work
I could have I could have told you that
you're you're going to Blink more
I could have told you that you need to
lick your lips and swallow
I could have told you you needed to
clear your throat
anything
like that
I could have told you that you're
thinking about something
that it was just a guess but if I got it
right you'd say oh something's happening
how did you know I was thinking about
that
so you see all of these they're all
different things from the yawn to
guessing what you're thinking but they
all have that same quality
you think and maybe you're right
but you think
it was caused by the hypnotist
so the moment you know that I'm causing
something to happen in your mind or your
body
you just opened the door
so that's the point where I know okay
you just have to be the keys I now have
the user interface
if I can't get the magic trick to work
it's because you're resisting
right now not every magic trick as I
call it is going to work with every
person
the Yuan worked on some of you yeah some
of you I would have told you that your
your eyelids are getting heavier and you
feel like you're going to Blink more
often that's what I use the most so
here's how it works you're sitting there
and I say to you and I'll say it now
this will affect some of you at home
I'll say did you know that it actually
takes muscles to keep your eyes open
and you'll be thinking to yourself does
it really
I suppose it does but it's so easy
it's so easy you don't really think
about it do you
that actually takes a muscle to keep
your eye open
and those muscles can get tired
sometimes you need to Blink just to
relax them
in fact you blink during the day anyway
right
so if you started blinking a little bit
more often
right now
well that wouldn't be unusual it would
it
because once you start thinking about
those eyes they are pretty heavy
and
when they start blinking
that's normal
you blink all day long you don't really
think about it
but right now as you're relaxing
and you're going into a complete relaxed
state
you might find that your eyes blink a
little bit more often
and as they blink
you'll find that you can actually feel
their weight for the first time you've
never really felt their weight before
have you
but when you blink you feel that when
you bring them back up
just it's imperceptible just a little
bit a little bit of weight you can feel
on your eyes and that weight will start
increasing because it's a muscle
it's gonna get tired the more you blink
the more tired it's going to be and as
your eyes blink they might not open up
entirely after every blink
in the beginning they'll open up
completely but with each blink and as
you relax and as those muscles start to
relax
you'll notice that you open up your eyes
maybe three quarters of a way maybe
halfway
and then you'll feel
eventually and it's starting to happen
pretty quickly
for some of you very quickly and for
some of you take just a moment longer
but you'll feel that you would feel
better
if the eye is just
completely relaxed
and they just closed
but you could feel them close as if
they're closing on their own
you could divorce your Consciousness
from your eyes
just let your eyes be what they want to
do
and what they want to do right now is
relax
and as you feel your eyes
blinking more and more and then
eventually blink until they close
you can just let it close
you can just allow your eyes to drift
clothes and stay closed
and when you do whether you've done it
yet or you're about to do it once your
eyes are closed
you'll find that a deep sense of
relaxation comes over you
and if your feet are both on the floor
and they should be if you have your legs
crossed uncross them but both feet flat
on the floor
make sure you're sitting upright
in this in a position which you wouldn't
fall asleep
comfortable chair sitting upright
make sure your arms are resting or
hanging ideally they would be resting on
a surface let's say the arms of the
chair if you have those
but just let them hang
now with your eyes closed
feel your breathing
just think about your breathing for a
moment
and just feel it
feel your inhale
and take a little extra inhale
just pause for just a moment as long as
you want
and then a nice long exhale
and when you're done with the first one
do a second one
big inhale long exhale at whatever Pace
you like
now
think about your right arm
just feel it just take your
Consciousness and move it to your right
arm
feels kind of heavy like a big weight
just laying on the arm of the chair or
just hanging down wherever it is
and you might notice
that your weight the weight of one arm
your right arm
starts to be a little bit heavier than
your left arm
isn't that interesting
your right arm is getting heavier
and you feel the weight from your left
arm actually start to transfer
and when you can feel that difference
when you can actually start to feel the
difference in the weight between your
right arm
and your left arm
you might actually eventually feel that
left arm
so light
that it would start to float
but not yet
but not yet
too soon
you're going to keep feeling that left
arm getting lighter
and the right arm getting heavier
while I take you through this
imaginary scene
imagine that you're in a room with
nothing
it's not exactly dark
it's darkish
but you can see and you can see there's
nothing
there are no walls there's nothing
and then suddenly in front of you
there appears a Stairway down
and you look down the stairway and you
see that there's something interesting
about these stairs
on each step
it has some words
and the words are the same every step
has the same word
and the word is
deeper
and you feel yourself drawn to the top
of the stairs and you step on the top
step
and you feel
deeper
and you take another step and you go
deeper
and you feel more relaxed
and with each step
now you're taking a step at a time on
your own
and with each step you feel yourself
getting more relaxed
more comfortable
happier
and deeper
now you're about a quarter of the way
down and a quarter of the way deeper
than you were before and with each step
you go deeper
and now there's just a few more steps to
the bottom
and you take them a little bit slowly
now
because you feel yourself
getting more tired
and deeper
and those last few steps are almost like
you're moving through wind or water
slower now
deeper
and now the last two steps
deeper
and deeper
and as you come off the bottom of the
stairs you can
barely walk not because you can't but
because you're so relaxed
you have no reason
and then appearing in front of you
you see an escalator
and the escalator is going down as well
if you see yourself floating onto the
top of the escalator and you feel
yourself start to go down
and they're written on the sides of the
escalator on the little wall below the
railing you see a word coming up
as you descend and as you get deeper
and as you get more and more relaxed
and that word is
also
deeper
and as you float down
the escalator
and there's nothing else there just the
escalator and just you
you're getting more and more relaxed
and deeper
and as you reach the bottom of the
escalator you float off
in front of you appears an elevator door
and you're literally floating
toward the door
slides open
you find yourself floating inside and
turning around you watch the door close
you see the buttons on the wall except
they're not like regular buttons for
regular buildings there's only one
button it's got an arrow and it points
down
and it's labeled
deeper
how do you feel yourself touching the
button almost as if your arm was acting
on its own
it was your right arm the heavy one your
light arm
is still getting lighter
and as the elevator starts to go down
you feel it you feel yourself first
getting lighter that you feel the weight
of the elevator
um
evening out and then as it comes to a
stop you feel yourself momentarily
giving heavier
but just as the elevator stops and you
reach your happiest
it reverses
your weight does not the elevator
and you find yourself lifting up off the
floor of the elevator
floating
and you float out of the elevator and
they're hanging in front of me was a
giant
pendulum
and the Pendulum is going from left to
right
and as it goes from left to right
there are some words
that float
at the highest point on the left of the
pendulum and the highest point on the
right
and it's the same word
deeper
and as you watch these pendulum go to
the top left
deeper
and to the right
deeper
and to the left
deeper
and to the right
deeper
you feel yourself
going to your absolute maximum
relaxation
and now completely relaxed
you bring your mind back to where you
were
in this world
and now your right arm
may have continued to get heavier
or may have waited until we got back
before it continues
and your left arm out is going to be so
light
that you're going to feel the difference
first in your smallest muscles of your
right arm actually in your fingers of
your right arm
and right hand
and you might feel that one of the
fingers on your left hand
starts to Twitch
might be your pinky might be your thumb
and you'll notice it'll be very small at
first
might not even be noticeable you might
feel it and not even be able to see it
very small
and each time you feel that little
energy that little
that little bit of energy that hits your
fingers and you feel the move
every time they move even the smallest
amount a little bit of weight transfers
over to your right arm
makes it heavier
and your right one lighter
for some of you your left arm is already
so light
that you could feel as if it might
start to lift
from where it's resting
you might feel
so light
it's almost as if
and all of you will be able to imagine
this now
a helium balloon
had been tied to your wrist it's a
pretty big balloon it's so big that it
can actually
tug on your arm a little bit
it wouldn't be able to lift your arm if
it were the normal weight because it's
just a balloon
it's a balloon full of helium but it's
just a balloon but your arm now is so
light
that is starting
to feel the tug
is starting to lift
now for some of you the arm is already
lifting
for some of you it's about to lift
you're all feeling at least a little bit
of sensation in your fingers
and for those who feel that sensation
growing
and you feel the lightness in the arm
and you feel it'll start to float
it will actually start to rise up off of
the surface it was resting on you can
feel the balloon tugging it or not
necessarily it may be just so light the
balloon is unnecessary
but what's this up there
and it's floating by itself
you'll feel that it starts to be brought
back toward your cheek
you'll feel your hand that's floating on
that floating arm
start to be drawn back to your own left
cheek
and as your hand starts to be drawn back
to the cheek
maybe very slowly at first you might not
feel it right away you might not feel
anything right away
but as that feeling grows that that
irreversible and irresistible pull
almost like a slight magnetic force is
causing these two things to come
together
but the moment you are left arm or hand
hit your left cheek
all of the weight will return to your
arm and it will go back to its resting
place and it will just drop
and when it drops
after it hits your cheek
and all that weight returns and your
right and left arm even out in weight
you're going to reach the deepest
most profound relaxation
you've ever experienced
and now in this deep and realized state
you've opened the user interface to your
own mind
you have full control
operating through me as your assistant
you relax and keep an eye on me
make sure that what I suggest is what
you want
because you have full control over that
and here's what I want
I want you
to experience
a complete and
to your biggest problem
you know what it is
I don't even have to mention it
but you're finding now that
inside your
mind
there's a thing called neuroplasticity
is what allows you to learn
it's what allows you to grow
it's the fact that your brain actually
reprograms itself on command
you just have to know how to tell it to
you know how to tell it to learn
something
and it changes when you learn your brain
is physically different when you learn
you are now in a programmable state
and your biggest problem
is starting to
disassemble
already it's breaking into smaller parts
and you can see the smaller parts of
your bigger problem
become clear
and as those parts
become clear
so too do their Solutions
it will be a different problem from each
you you all have your own
but you now have experienced your own
brain
activating to solve the problem that
your conscious brain
was stumped by
I'm going to employ the subconscious
part of your brain
to disassemble your biggest problem into
its smallest parts
and then the rest of your brain is going
to solve each of those small parts one
at a time
it might be that you need a system
it might need might be that you need to
change something
but those small changes that you need to
make to add up to the big change you
needed it was hard to get started wasn't
it it was a little hard to get off the
couch it was a little hard to make that
phone call it was a little hard to talk
to that person it was a little hard to
sign up for that thing you needed
but now you can
because you've taken the big problem and
you broke it into small parts and when
you look at each of the small parts you
say well that's not hard I can dial the
phone
let me just do the next part
dial the phone
I can talk to somebody I can say hi
that's easy let's do the next part and
when you find that all of your problems
can be disassembled to small parts and
you can take the smallest step on each
one
toward fixing it and keep in mind not
everything you do will be immediately
the right thing some of it is
experimenting sometimes you're going to
find out what doesn't work in your
process of finding out what does
let me give you this one story from
actor Michael Keaton
he said that when he did interviews or
he did auditions for parts
it was very destructive feeling because
he would go there and quite often you
don't get the part
and so it feels like a failure and he
would go home feeling like a failure
until he relearned he learned to reframe
his experience
and no longer do you say I'm there to
get that job and if I don't get it I
fail
he said to himself interviewing and
auditioning
is my job
if I went to an audition today I did my
job
and I'm happy about that because I did
my work
I had a job and I did it I got better at
it and I increased my odds of getting a
job now every time he goes to an
interview or an audition he doesn't
think what if I don't get it what if I
do he thinks today will be successful
I did my job I went to an audition
you'll give some of those jobs he
doesn't know which ones but he knows
that he has to go to auditions to do it
and so you too will find that all those
smaller things you need to do
to fix everything in your life
are now more accessible
instead of seeming like one big
impossible thing
now it seems like a bunch of little
steps each one quite accessible
and it doesn't matter what your problem
was maybe you were anxious maybe you had
a mental problem maybe you had
a natural real life problem maybe it's
pain
could be anything
all of your Solutions will be different
but in each case you're going to a B
test yourself
to success try solution a if it doesn't
work
discard it immediately try B if it
doesn't work discard it immediately try
what's next
you are now all on a path
toward it
increasing the quality of your life
substantially
and now from your relaxed state
you're going to feel yourself
getting less and less relaxed but in a
good way when you wake up and open your
eyes you will be completely away
and energized and feeling good and ready
for the day
and every bit of this will stay with you
and allow you to break your big problems
into small
automatically
and all of them will seem more
accessible and solvable and then you
will
I'm going to count backwards from 20 to
1 when I hit one your eyes will open
you'll be awake and refreshed feeling
better than you've ever felt
in your entire life
20 19.
18 getting more awake 17 16.
15 14 getting more awake happier 13 12.
10 8 6.
five four almost completely awake three
two
and now completely awake one
hello
now
there's a thing that happens right after
hypnosis
and I'm going to do it right now
it's the part where I ask you about your
experience and then you tell me
tell me what you felt
tell me did your arm feel lighter
yes or no
did anybody's arm feel lighter
yes yes yes no yes yes no yes no yes no
now that's about that's about the ratio
one would expect
now with hypnosis remember I told you
you can't do it
um as easily if you're not there in
person
for those of you who didn't feel
anything
if I had been there in person you would
you would because I would I would see
that you weren't feeling it part of
hypnosis is observing somebody and
knowing if what you're doing is having
the right impact so I would have been
able to observe you directly not having
an impact because you can tell
and then I want to change what I was
saying or I would have spent more time
getting you into the mood
before I got the result I wanted but I
will tell you that pretty sure a hundred
percent of the people that I've ever
done hypnosis on in person
felt the the arm floating
um I don't think there I don't think
it's ever not worked in my experience
did you ad-lib that it's that's actually
um less than a complete
induction so that's called an induction
but it wasn't complete
um so one of the parts that would
normally be part of that would be some
counting from 1 to 20 and then from 20
back to one
and what that does is it serves to just
deepen you so so there's sort of a
filler or extender part of that that
actually takes a while
y20 is a random number you know 10 just
happens too quickly and 30 is
unnecessary so there's no reason for 20.
yeah so you don't here's what you don't
need let me tell you what parts of
hypnosis are not the active ingredients
the the tonal quality of my voice
is not important
um the pauses
uh are not completely necessary but I
like using them because they make you
focus on me
so sometimes you'll have to wait for my
next word I do that intentionally
so if I say you need to wait for
my next word
for a moment there all of your attention
just went why is that blank there what's
that next word okay
if I were just talking consistently
your attention would be with me but
sometimes you'd be thinking about other
things too you would be dipping in and
out
but my pauses make you say okay there's
something going on here I gotta I gotta
focus on this I don't want to miss that
next word so that's why I do it so focus
and repetition and Association
relaxation
influence you know just from other
people we just pick up the influence
expectations priming
you know these are all the components
and then feedback that's probably the
most important one watching what works
and then adjusting it
now once somebody is hypnotized
you're going to have to give them a
suggestion that makes sense for them
specifically
so since I was doing everybody who was
watching at the same time they're now a
few thousand of you
um I had to go with something that I
knew would work for every single person
because there's nobody here who doesn't
have a problem that they need to break
down
and solve
I was going to go with confidence that's
the other thing that would have worked
because everybody's better off with more
confidence you know as long as it's not
crazy
so that's that's another good one you
can do with everybody
you use the pause count in sales
um
all right how many of you were afraid
to participate in this little experiment
because you didn't want to give up your
control
did anybody have that feeling
you didn't want to give up your control
yeah some of you that's usually what I
hear
but the thing you need to know about
hypnosis and this is something I would
have put into pre-talk
so what you saw was a very uh compacted
one
if we were doing this in person it would
be like a 45 minute to an hour thing so
everything would have been extended and
it would be a lot more detail and in the
in the
entire process but one of the things I
would have told you is this
the hypnotist is never in charge of you
the hypnotist is never in charge and
there's nothing that you would do that
you wouldn't feel was perfectly
appropriate for you to deal to do
so under hypnosis if I said to you go
buy a gun and kill my enemy
you would sit there and you'd have
exactly the same thought you would have
now which is what
why would I do that I'm not going to do
that
yeah there'll be no difference in your
thought process
under hypnosis and the outside of
hypnosis none you would say I'm not
gonna do that
so you don't have to worry about
anything you know taking over your brain
everything everything's transparent
Greg says he was afraid I would molest
him
now
Greg playing a safe
I think that was a wise move
because I know where you live
all right
um
uh can you get rid of any ever heard
you have an Amber Heard problem run away
that's all you can do
yes so there was a little uh thinking
past the sale that's part of the process
too
yeah
um if you're trying to change a
narcissist don't
go to YouTube
spend an hour looking at the experts
talking about how to handle a narcissist
and every one of them will have the same
advice no exception
get out of there
yeah just run away nobody says work it
out nobody there's no expert who says
stay there and work it out none
because the problem is they feed on you
if you fall into the frame that you're
in a relationship
you're doomed
because they're not in a relationship
you are their food you're their food
so it's like saying well I've got this
Hungry Wolf who has no other source of
food and tried to work things out with
them so he doesn't eat me and use it use
me as his food
there's no amount of training you can do
to make a starving wolf not eat you if
you're his food
so trying to get a narcissist
to not not consume you that's nothing
because the more you try to make it not
happen the more they enjoy it
right the more you struggle the happier
they are
right
so run away just run away
uh could I hypnotize Jennifer Aniston
for you
absolutely I will get right on that
all right well you can see what happens
when I'm not prepared
was there anything in the news today
so I saw that the uh the Republicans
came out with this uh some kind of uh
what are they calling it
the house commitment to America
and it's going to include fighting
inflation border security protecting
women's sports
does protecting women's sports
should that be right in the on the top
line of your National policy
I wonder if they've done some research
to find out that it actually gets votes
it might I don't know maybe guess what
yeah so where's where's fentanyl on
there so apparently fentanyl is not as
important as protecting women's sports
but he does say border security I mean
that's part of fentanyl but it's just a
small part do most of you know that
closing the Border
wouldn't have that much impact on
fentanyl right because the way the
government is fooling you
is by telling you how much they're uh
how much they're capturing On the Border
don't fall for that
don't fall for how much they're
capturing at the border
because that's a trick
that has everything to do with how much
is being shipped do you know why they're
catching so much to the Border
because the border is the easiest place
to ship it
if the Border were the hardest place to
ship it how much would they catch
none
and how much fentanyl would get in if
the Border was completely sealed how
much fentanyl would get in
if the southern border was completely
sealed not not a single person or pill
got through there how much fentanyl
would get to the United States
no the answer is all of it
all of it
you just put it on a boat
do you know I could put enough fentanyl
to kill uh San Francisco it would be the
size of a baseball
I'd walk up to the fence with enough
fentanyl to kill everybody in San
Francisco it would be in my hand the
size of a baseball
and say hey Juan catch and I throw it
over the wall
and Juan would catch it and say thanks
for this ball of fentanyl that's enough
to kill everybody in San Francisco
see you next week
the the thing that the country doesn't
understand and the reason the reason you
don't understand it
is because the government does not want
you to understand that
the Republicans don't want you to
understand that border security won't
help you with fentanyl you know why
because they want border security
oh
did I just figure out why the
Republicans are not working on fentanyl
because they want border security
that's got to be it
it's got to be it I've been wondering
why the Republicans have been worthless
pieces of
about fentanyl from the start
complete worthless piece of they
need it they need it for the political
they needed to to make the Border
arguments stronger and it's pure
oh you you
 you better separate those
issues or I'm going to take you down
I'm going to take down anybody who keeps
saying that border security is is their
answer to fentanyl I started with Carrie
Lake
Carrie Lake um responded to one of my
tweets yesterday
with her
um plan for Fentanyl
the biggest part of that plan was border
security Kerry Lake you're a fraud
you're a fraud
you're a fraud
Carrie Lake you are a fraud
you need to separate
um
fentanyl from border security border
security has a little bit to do with it
maybe 10 percent
but you are a fraud
and if you don't separate those topics
I'm going to take you down with
everybody else who's doing the same
thing you're all liars you're you're a
 liar you're a liar if
you're saying the border is scary as you
answer it defensively you know it's not
you know it's not and don't tell me how
much you caught at the border that's an
irrelevant number don't tell me how much
Trump caught at the border and let me
let me say this just as clearly
I think Trump said something about how
much was caught at the border or
something on his interview
 Trump right now it
might be the right number of how much
they caught what I'm saying is is if you
let them talk about how much they caught
at the border they're not doing their
 jobs
and they're not trying to
they're trying to fool you into the
issue
the issue is border security let's get
that border security now I'm all for
border security you know that I love my
border security
I would even like a wall wherever it
makes sense
but if you're trying to conflate this
with fentanyl you you monster
 piece of that's what I
think of you if you if you tell me that
border security is your fentanyl plan
here here's a fentanyl plan
I'm gonna get I'm gonna get Narcan in
every home
or every car or something like that
because Narcan is a you know a way to
save somebody who's overdosing on
Fentanyl
we know that we know it works now it's
not like a perfect solution right you'd
have to know how to use it you'd have to
get there in time you'd have to know
it's the right you know time to use it
so it's not perfect
but if you've got Narcan in every home
you would probably take
a third of the overdoses away just
guessing but I would think at least a
third of them would end you know the
rest of them there's nobody around and
they can't find their cat don't know how
to use it whatever
but right now I think that you need a
prescription for Narcan can somebody do
a fact check on that in the United
States
maybe a difference by state I don't know
but I think you need a prescription for
Narcan do you know what that means that
means nobody's going to get it
if you need a prescription
right
Carrie Lake if you want to be useful
tell your people how to get some
Narcan
skip your entire speech and just give us
the instructions of how to get an arcan
and you will be the number one best
fentanyl fighter in the United States
and
I will support you
because that would be the best plan
nobody else has a plan
Carrie Lake if you tell me that you
would do what Matt Gates suggests and
bomb the cartels then you have a plan
now you have my attention
I don't know if that's a good idea or a
bad idea frankly but you have my
attention and I want to talk about it
find out if it's good
so stop with us with this border
security equals fentanyl you're
Liars you're all liars and
idiots if you believe it's true well
then you're just an idiot
right so pick your choice if you're
going to sell us this you tell
us you're an idiot or a liar
idiot or liar two choices idiot
or liar and every time you hear somebody
saying border security is their answer
to fentanyl you should say this question
that's interesting are you an idiot or a
 liar because you know that's not
true you know it's not going to work and
you think we don't know that you think
we're stupid enough to think
that your border security is really your
fentanyl prop it's not it's not your
fentanyl it's not your policy you don't
have a policy Republicans
Republicans you don't have a
fentanyl policy
and this piece of
this this new Republican house piece of
 total fail total failure absolute
total failure McCarthy sorry you failed
today all you Republicans failed
you all failed
you know I always wondered what would
happen when
um
I wasn't afraid of anything
you ever wonder about that what would
happen if you weren't afraid of anything
you know that what I call for the
bombing of the cartels I'm putting my
life in jeopardy right
you know that the odds of being me being
tortured and killed are pretty high
right now
you know that if I go after Russia and
Putin he does kill people in other
countries
his critics he does
you know that the odds of me being
canceled for God knows what are very
high right
but
the controls are coming off
I'm just going to play like this like a
video game until the end
and what I mean is
if I don't respawn that's fine
I'm just going to put it all on the
table now
if I don't get this fentanyl thing taken
care of
I'm not going to be happy when I you
know go to my dirt nap in the end
I'm going to get this done and if I
don't get it done I'm going to destroy
people on the way I'm going to destroy
anybody who gets in my way
because they're doing it intentionally
I wouldn't destroy anybody who just
didn't understand or you know it was
accidental you know maybe they had other
priorities oh okay
but if you are intentionally
fooling me
about what you can or cannot do about a
fentanyl or you're ignoring the biggest
problem in the country
then you're going to have to get out of
the way
and if you don't get out of the way I'm
going to take you down Carrie
lake is first on my list
I know you love Kerry Lake and that's
part of the reason and by the way
let me let me say this directly
care Lake's pretty awesome
do we agree as a
political figure as a communicator as a
personality
she's got a lot of skill a lot of skill
I'd be surprised if she lost the
election
but
I will take her down if she
doesn't separate border security from
Fentanyl and everybody else it has
nothing to do with Kerry Lake right she
just happened to be the first one who
walked into my yeah into my kills out
if you walk into the kill box
don't don't complain to me and McCarthy
just walked into the kill box I have no
problems with the McCarthy but if you're
going to sell me this plan and
it doesn't have any serious fentanyl
anything in it I am going to resist it
and mock it and uh
try to get you to do the same
I wonder if I didn't have enough coffee
this morning
what am I going to do the Dems I'm going
to make them compete
and I'm going to try to get uh one to
ten million voters to treat this
election as potentially
a single a single issue vote
because I would I would take another
four years of Biden I know
I would take four more years of Biden if
he had a plan to be Fentanyl and it
sounded like it really would get it done
no that's not going to happen so you
don't have to worry about it right but
that's how serious I am
I think Biden's a disaster
but I would take four more years of him
because he's the turn to get president
let me put it another way
in my opinion the next president is the
tourniquet president
right the tourniquet is the thing you
have to do right away and nothing else
matters it doesn't matter if you have a
headache if you're bleeding to death
so you got to put the tourniquet on and
stop the bleeding then maybe you work on
the headache
fentanyl is the
is the bleeding arm
we're at War
we're a war and we're acting like we're
not
we should be on a war footing literally
military war footing the military of the
United States should be protecting the
Homeland and isn't do it let me
ask you how many trillion
dollars does our homeland security
people have how many trillions
and and what have they done for fentanyl
they've captured the excess that didn't
make any difference
that's what they've done
there's not a single person in
this country who can't get fentanyl if
they want it
all of the fentanyl they caught all of
it how much difference did it make
with all the all that they caught how
many fewer people took fentanyl none
none because it was so much it didn't
matter how much it caught just didn't
matter so we're actually working on the
don't matter part
the part that couldn't make any
difference how much you catch couldn't
make any difference stop being
gullible
don't care and in fact and here's
another thing for you the next time you
see somebody bragging about how much
they caught at the border here's what
you should respond to not wow that's a
good job you sure corn a lot of stuff at
the border how about you miserable
that is a distraction because you know
how much you catch at the border has
nothing to do with anything because
there's so much coming in the Border you
could catch truckloads of it and
they would just make more
because there's so many holes in the
 border they can put it through
there all day long you catch 10 percent
of it oh great you caught 10 of what has
doubled
good job worthless pieces of
stop lying to us
stop lying to us about fentanyl
border security won't get it done and no
matter how much you catch irrelevant
completely irrelevant to the issue
and so
I don't think I maintained your relaxed
state that I generated in the beginning
of this
all right
uh was there anything else going on
let me check the news for the um other
things let's see there's something
that's less important than fence at all
something less important than fencing oh
 you it's all less important that's
all I'm going to talk about today
um
any other questions
oh there was another thing that I saw
people were trying to understand
uh here's here's how you don't want to
be an NPC are you ready
here's what the NPCs say about Fentanyl
but but but it has legitimate legal uses
don't be that person
of course it has legitimate legal uses
of course we want that to continue
of course it should be illegal medically
of course
who's gonna who's gonna argue with that
if you need to bring that up
don't now I get I get that there could
be you know too much tightening and you
know you could go too far in the medical
sense I'm not promoting that
there's nothing I've ever said that said
tighten up on the prescriptions have you
ever heard me say that have I ever said
tighten up on those prescriptions no I
think it's an issue that people who know
what they're talking about should deal
with but I'm not one of them I don't
know haven't they done enough done too
much I don't know that's not my issue so
just leave that out
medical fentanyl I let me ask you
do a hundred percent of you support
medical use of Fentanyl
if there's not a good alternative
right yes
so don't be an NPC and bring that up
because it's a distraction you're not
helping if you want to if you want to
make the argument worse and more
confused
just talk about the medical stuff that's
that's nothing here's the second thing
you a lot of people don't know and I
thought they did but they don't
did you know that people do score
fentanyl directly
did you know that Alex by the way there
was a time when I didn't know this
either but addicts do go and look for
Fentanyl they say can you sell me some
fentanyl
and the dealer says I've got some
Fentanyl
here's your Fentanyl and the dealer says
that's exactly what I want like I use
every time and I'll go shoot up my
Fentanyl
does that guy die
does that guy die the guy who bought his
Fentanyl
usually no do you know why he doesn't
die because he knows it's Fentanyl
right
right
if I put a a wild Live tiger in your
house
and said don't go in there there's a
wild tiger in your house well you'd
probably be fine because you wouldn't go
in there but if you didn't know you
might go in there and the tiger kills
you it's the people who get fentanyl and
don't know it
because they don't know they're
overdosing
if you have fentanyl you've probably
learned what is too much
you know maybe by observation or some
other way I don't know however however
addicts learn but they know
um they also know how to set did you
know this
the the one of the reasons that people
die of fentanyl is they'll be sitting in
a chair
and they they pass out and their their
head nods down like this
it cuts off their oxygen and they don't
wake up
so if you knew that you could lay back
so that your your head didn't fall
forward your odds of dying go way down
so that that's just one you know one
part of the technique so the point is
um we're not worried we're not worried
about medical Fentanyl let's be really
clear about that I'm not asking for any
changes in medical fentanyl maybe maybe
some are needed but I don't know about
them
so I'm not asking for that
and I'm not I'm not asking for
well I'm not saying there's a big
problem with people who are
intentionally trying to get a fentanyl
the problem is The Accidental stuff and
the stuff that looks like candy that's
killing people that that's apparently
this new there's a new fentanyl pill
that looks like it's
it's made to look like candy
and apparently it's killed the number of
people under 15 recently not a
coincidence rainbow
what's it called rainbow cakes
or rainbow pills
or something like that some rainbow
drugs of some kind
so
those are things you need to know
now you are uh now you're up to date in
Fentanyl
if you attack the cartels no one will
come to their defense now if you attack
the cartels the the risk is that they
would attack the Homeland
through Terror sex
um that's why we should negotiate with
the cartels
so as much as I want the heads of the
cartels
to be killed
I was still very happily settled for
negotiating some kind of climb down from
their business in fact I would hire the
cartels
to keep the other car I would hire one
cartel to keep the other cartels out of
this business because you know if one
stop the other ones would pick it up so
I'd I'd hire this Sinaloa cartel
to be the enforcers to kill the other
cartels if they try to sell Fentanyl
and then I would give the Sinaloa cartel
full control of the border crossing
business
and then I would negotiate with them
maybe you know I'm just talking off the
top of my head but we we have to do
things that we've never done before and
it might be that you need to negotiate
with terrorists you might need to
negotiate with terrorists
now we say we never do that but of
course we do there are heads of state we
negotiate with and practically
terrorists of course we do we negotiate
with Iran
what's the difference
okay there's a difference
do you think our intelligence Community
isn't already hiring the Sinaloa cartel
to sell fentanyl no I don't
I do not think that they're doing that I
do think that maybe intelligence
agencies are using cartels for some
kinds of mutual benefit that's probably
true
so you actually think that the our
American intelligence American
intelligence you think the CIA is
helping the cartels sulfentanyl into the
United States
and what would be the reason for that
okay somebody actually thinks is saying
that a lot of you do oh my God
why to make Black Ops money no
so there's some people that think the
CIA is funding itself with fentanyl
well that would explain a lot wouldn't
it I don't believe that's true because
um so let me just say that so I don't
believe that's true
I do understand that there's a history
of the CIA getting dirty money and and
sort of that kind of context
um it could be true
I don't think it's true because of the
number of people dying from Fentanyl
see if you found out that the CIA was
pushing
um cocaine
you'd say to yourself I hate that but
you'd probably get over it if you heard
they were pushing fentanyl you wouldn't
get over it
am I right
am I right
if you heard that the CIA was dealing or
helping dealing cocaine
I think you can get over it because you
look oh it's a dirty business
but if you heard that they were selling
fentanyl into the United States and it
killed a quarter of a million Americans
knowingly
no no
they couldn't they couldn't risk being
caught with that that would be too much
of a risk Plus
that would make them traitors
it wouldn't matter why they were getting
the money under your scenario it
wouldn't matter why they thought they
had some good reason to get this money
they would still just be traitors
do you think there are that many people
in the CIA who are literally just
Traders
you know
I doubt it
and somebody says yes a lot of you think
yes you think that the CIA is filled
with Traders
you're harsh all right I'm not going to
go that far
I can't go that far because too many
people would know about an operation
like that there would be a whistleblower
in there somewhere too many
whistleblowers
right well I think we've meet we've
reached a peak
distrust
Peak distrust and maybe that's good
I'm not even sure that's bad
you know when we talk about how it's
terrible that we're not trusting our
institutions anymore
do you say to yourself oh that's bad
it's bad that we don't trust our
institutions anymore I don't say that
I I feel like we reached a higher level
of awareness I'm not sure that's ever
bad
all right well
it appears that I managed to babble for
over an hour with no preparation
whatsoever
I've told you before that that's a
learned skill if I ever mentioned that
that of course I have too many times
yeah the Dale Carnegie course teaches
you to do what you just watched
uh every I'm going to make a statement
that I think is true it might be an
exaggeration but I think this is
actually true I think everybody who took
the Dale Carnegie course that I took
could have uh awakened 10 minutes before
alive one hour live stream and filled it
and you wouldn't know
it's actually a skill so that is a
really valuable part of the palette
Talent stack
I mean imagine you were in my place
two minutes before I went live
well actually when I went live I didn't
have any idea what I was going to do
I didn't have even a tentative plan
I had no idea where it was going to go
but I also didn't worry
because what the Dale Carnegie course
teaches you to do is have you know
little packets of stories in case you
need to whip one out now that some I was
lucky this time because somebody asked
about hypnosis and as soon as you asked
about hypnosis I thought oh I could do
45 minutes on hypnosis with no
preparation whatsoever
so I did
but you should always have
you know your 10 minute story your 45
minute story
so you should always be walking around
with with little packets of things you
could you could use in times like this
yeah
what time did I fall asleep last night
um
last night I fell asleep at
uh probably 10 P.M
then again it
12 p.m 1 30 again at 2 30 3 30 4 30 and
5 30.
falling asleep is easy
I hate being asleep
I'm physically uncomfortable when I
sleep I just don't like it I just hate
it yeah sometimes you know you use a
restroom sometimes
anyway
just one thing after another
lucid dreaming now
I by
about 2 A.M I didn't want to be sleeping
anymore I just desperately wanted the
night to be over and I just wanted to be
awake I don't like sleep I don't like it
at all
your whole life we're getting worse oh
getting worse
the I know how to sleep
right
so if if you asked me to do an essay
um Scott do you have a problem sleeping
would you know how to fix it yes
yes I know how to fix it
it would be easy
don't go to Starbucks at three in the
afternoon and have a giant caffeinated
beverage
it's not really hard that's all it would
take and yesterday I got busy and I
didn't exercise
have I ever told you the my two out of
three Theory
of Happiness have I mentioned that the
two out of three Theory
the two out of three Theory goes like
this
I have to do at least two of the
following three things to have a good
day
I've got to have productive work or
where I say to myself I did I did some
good work today
I've got to have exercise
and some physical intimacy
right now if you can't have two of those
three and it doesn't matter which two I
don't consider it a good day
so yesterday I had work
some of you were following my uh
my escapades so you've seen the trouble
I've been getting into you know in the
news so if you're following the news and
trending things you know that I've been
busy for the last few days yeah that the
Press has been just
calling me all day long like all day
long my phone is begging can you do an
interview I'm not doing any interviews
I'm just not going to do any on the
topic of the cancellations
so uh but lots of requests oh by the way
CNN asked me to be on
does that surprise you
yeah it's brick Oddish
I've told you before this merconish is
the real deal
so he even though he's on CNN he's
actually just smirk Oddish
as far as I can tell as far as I could
tell no matter what the CNN was doing
Smyrna College was just being super
punished so he's the only one that I
would say that about
really well maybe that's too far there's
probably some others uh
uh probably some others
but if you were wondering if CNN has
changed their editorial policy
they didn't ask me on for anything for
several years
several years they did not invite me but
now I guess I guess I could be invited
under these and by the way the story
that I was going to tell
would not have been necessarily
a CNN appropriate story
they were asking me to be on on this
topic of being canceled in newspapers
at the same time they knew the story was
in the context of my anti-esg stuff
so just think about this CNN today with
their current management was going to
have me on
they invited me
to talk about anti-esg and getting
canceled
although I have not connected the
cancellation with the ESG so I haven't
made that connection
I don't know why I was canceled it could
have been any reason
um but just think about that and so I I
turned them down but only because I'm
turning everybody down and
I had to praise the the producer I think
it Carter off guard and said you know I
got to just give you a compliment I
think your new management is totally
working and I don't think I would have
been invited except for your you know
new change of Direction and I got to
give you some respect for that
completely through her I think she
didn't know what to say I don't think
she was expecting the compliments so
could be a setup except that it was
merconic
see if if if it had been say Don Lemon
then I might say to myself oh you're
gonna you know trick me somehow but
smart college is just this is a straight
shooter so it would have been exactly
what it looked like I think you would
have asked tough questions
which was that's his job
uh
when it was I last on superconish
few years ago
but I've been on two or three times I
can't remember
I think there was one other thing I was
going to tell you but
I don't remember oh
how many of you watched the five
yesterday
and did you watch it all the way to the
end and the handoff to Brett Bear
if you watched it to the the very end
Brett Bear
did the funniest thing I've ever seen on
the news and he did it with a straight
face and the the beauty is you don't
expect him to do to uh to deliver the
humor
especially this particular joke
but I'll give you the setup in case you
missed it I I was freaking laughing it
was tremendous so during the handoff the
people at the five will bring on a split
screen with Brett Baer whose show is up
next now Brett is the hard news guy
right so he's just the news and the five
is you know pure fun and fun and opinion
and so they have a little fun little
handoff there so Jesse Waters had just
announced earlier in the show that his
other show later his special guest would
be Scott Baio and not not the fake Scott
Baio but the real one I guess there were
some fake ones uh so Jesse had uh just
said that and Brett Baer comes on with a
complete stray face he says you can't
wait can't wait to watch Jessie's show
and and Scott Baio
he said it with a straight face it was
it was just awesome
and and Jesse was still on the screen
and you saw Jesse just lose it because
he knew how funny that was like you know
basically laughing at his own his own
technique now the thing I love about
Jesse Waters is and I don't know how he
arrived here like I don't know how he
arrived at this place but he does a a
self-aware
version of a biased Republican
that is so fun to watch
like like sometimes it's a joke but
there's often a point in there that he
really means and and sometimes you can't
tell how much is a joke and how much is
the point and you really have to follow
it and I think he has and by the way I
think uh
uh I think that Greg gutfeld's influence
on the rest of the five is just so
obvious you know they've all tried to
take their their humor Gene up a level
and he's managed to do that for all the
regulars
um do you remember when uh uh Harold
Ford
just started being a regular guest and
he seemed kind of stiff
and you're like oh Harold you always say
the same
like you know monotone sort of thing
like I guess a personality but I think
Greg and the rest of the staff you know
finally
probably brought brought him into the
whole fold and that was great like he's
a really strong strong member of the
guest and uh Jessica Tarlov um
she's she's also like raised her game
she's very entertaining now that show is
really tremendous
it was some point I was going to make
there but I think I got
was there a point I was making that I
got sidetracked on
I feel like I completely missed my point
oh the point was that Jesse does a a
self-aware character
so that when Brett Baer was was giving
him some some about the let's say
the weight the political weight of his
his guest that even Jesse thought that
was pretty funny so that was that was
like my favorite my favorite uh
three seconds of television in a year
it was just so so well executed
um
you think Jessica Tarlov
um is ridiculous
your opinions I don't think your
opinions are ridiculous I think they
just mirror Republican
pretty standard Republican opinions
I think I think she does a good job
the the thing you want is does she have
the the fight you know does she have the
personality the Charisma the the humor
the you know does she does she get it
and she does
so
that's that's pretty
so I give her credit I think she does a
great job
uh McCarthy specifically called out
China concerning fentanyl oh oh I'm
sorry oh I take everything back ah here
I was criticizing McCarthy but it turns
out he called out China
oh well I guess we're fine now
he called the marrow
 nothing
 nothing
do you know what being serious about
um
stopping their fentanyl trade would look
like
here's what it would look like
China we've asked you to stop shut down
your internal fentanyl dealers it's not
optional
if you don't do it we're going to do it
for you
it's not optional
because right now China thinks it's
optional don't they
they think it's optional
now they might have to come up with some
you know new threat or a penalty to us
but you have to tell them whatever
happens after this we're going to deal
with that later
but I want to tell you one thing in 30
days your internal dealers are all going
to be dead
plus whoever was standing next to them
all right that part is not in that that
part is not up for debate you can do it
yourself
you can do it yourself that's our choice
our first choice is you take care of
yourself but if you don't in 30 days
we're gonna go wet
and there's nothing you can do to stop
us
and I know you're going to threaten us
with all kinds of of you know costs and
we will we will accept that
whatever it is you're going to do to us
because of this we accept
but the thing you need to know is
there's no way in 30 days those guys
will still be free and alive and doing
business you understand that right and
then they would say
then they would say oh we have nukes and
you know we're we're going to withdraw
our diplomats and if you did that we
would have to maybe murder some of your
people and we'd round up so many people
none you say to them
as clearly as you can
we understand
we understand
but in 30 days
they're all going to be dead
that's the only part you need to know
there's one fact here and only one fact
that you need to deal with
they're all going to be dead in 30 days
so you can do it yourself
or you can wait for us to do it
and you will have to respond and we
understand that because you're a
sovereign country we do respect you
China we do know you'll have to respond
but that's where you're going you're not
going anywhere else you're not changing
the topic
you're not distracting us this problem
ends in 30 days and you just get to
choose How It Ends
I'm going to choose that it ends you get
to choose how
and if you want to work with us we'll
work with you but it ends right now
then you say to Mexico
we know you don't have control over the
of the cartels
we know that when we invade your country
which we are
which we are let me be clear we're going
to invade your country
militarily
we know that you have to complain we
know you have to go to the United
Nations we know you have to do
everything you need to do
but here's what we want you to know
we're going to do it anyway
we know that this is immoral and
unethical
you might argue we know the innocent
people in Mexico are going to die and we
regret that we're going to do it anyway
we know this could destroy relations
with with Mexico forever
we're going to do it anyway
we know
that there are any number of bad
repercussions from this we're going to
do it anyway we know it might not stop
fentanyl they might find some way to
reconstitute
we're going to do it anyway
so if you don't get to that level of
decision
you're just talking
McCarthy's just talking
he's just talking he's got nothing
so if all you're going to do is talk I
don't care how tough you talk
you've got to decide and they have not
decided anything
all right I think that I'm going to
leave it on that note
but wait let's say something happy
before we go
I need a million of you to say you'll be
a single issue voter you wouldn't be you
wouldn't be bound you can vote any way
you want it but I need a million of you
at least
to say you'll be a single issue voter
okay
you need your politician to believe it
could happen
you can vote any way you want once you
get into the voting booth nobody's
nobody's gonna
uh there's no penalty
but I want you to be able to say it in
public as often as you can say it in
social media tell your friends you know
and you might even be alive that's okay
lying lying is allowed
for this topic lying is allowed to end
fentanyl so if you need to lie go ahead
and just say I'm going to be a single
issue voter I'm Fentanyl
if enough people say there will be
single issue voters on Fentanyl
we might be able to get our politicians
to compete and that's all I want I just
want them to compete for the best
fentanyl plan
everybody in
good YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
