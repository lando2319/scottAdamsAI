good morning
everybody I'm stalling so all of your
live streams catch
up that was me talking
myself all right welcome to the
highlight of civilization it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and if you'd
like to take your experience up the
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny human brains all you
need for that is a cuper mug or glass of
CH Stein the Cen Jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the doping mean
hit of the day thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
ah what a
day well there's a gigantic War that's
just kicked off between Israel and Iran
and oh it's
over it's
over well there were plenty of
casual well there weren't any I don't
think there were any casualties but
there were gigantic
explosion well we're not sure what the
explosions were or if there were but the
Israelis they hit many we're not sure if
they really hit anything because Iran
said nothing really happened but Israel
is
claiming but Iran says nothing really
happened so I guess everything's
fine that might be the world's most
efficient
War you know last night I go to sleep
it's like World War II is kicked off and
then I wake up it's like I'm not even
sure anything
happened yeah did you hear an explosion
I I didn't hear anything that's what
they're saying in Iran so I guess this
is a performance
theater War
pretending to have a war to make your
own people happy that's what's going on
right let's talk about a few things I
tried yesterday on uh chat
GPT I gave it a little ethics and
morality lesson because I was curious
how does AI get ethics and morality does
it get it the same way it gets
intelligence just by looking at the
patterns of human behavior because that
seem
sketchy yeah because humans are not all
that ethical or is it hardcoded by the
creators and it told me that it was
hardcoded by the creators I mean I had
to work at a little bit but it told me
that so I asked that the following
question is it more ethical and
moral to uh use climate change
alarm and pursue climate change
Solutions or is it more ethical to lower
the cost of energy for uh developing
countri
countries what do you think is
said what would a human say well humans
are really bad at analyzing things so
they have a bad time comparing those two
options so they default to a um I would
say a political point of
view so if it's if it's too difficult to
sort out you know is changing the energy
policy going to hurt or help the poor
people in the short run versus the long
run and you know is there a long run if
there's no short run it's it's really
hard to know what's
better so in in the human world we just
pick a side because we can't figure out
the math of it so we just go well my
team says this so I guess I'm on that
side Well turns out AI is going to do
the same thing because AI said it's
definitely more moral and ethical to
battle climate change than it is to give
developing
countries uh abundant cheap energy
now would you do you agree with
that does your moral and
ethical sense line up with what AI is
well the important thing here is that
you have to understand that the morality
and the ethics are being
hardcoded they're they're being given to
the AI by
humans and humans don't agree on what is
more moral or ethical we might agree if
we all could do the analysis the same
you know if there were just one
calculation and we all looked at it we
all thought it was the right calculation
we might agree and even then we might
not so AI is going to have a very uh
confident opinion on the morality of
things and it will be just something
that a human being told it to say are
you comfortable with
that you shouldn't be yeah the better
answer let me ask you this you've
probably used AI enough those of you you
have to know that when it gets to a
thorny question it likes to do both
sides ISM well some people say this but
other people argue that am I right that
that's the usual way it answers a
question some people say this but other
people say
that but when it comes to climate change
they're just like nope it's more moral
to pursue climate change because in the
long run it's better for everybody
which is based on not the best
information probably all right uh I saw
moms for Liberty Post I don't know if
this is true but the claim is the Biden
Administration their new title 9
regulations uh will um will allow
schools to not inform the parents if
their minor child seeks assistance for
an abortion uh or wishes to transition
genders or prefers different pronouns
so the school can be raising your child
to have an abortion without you knowing
it transition without you knowing it and
having pronouns without you
knowing now I guess the real question
here we could argue you know what's good
or bad or right or wrong but how in the
world do you argue that the school
should make those decisions without the
parents have you ever been in a room
with anybody who made that
argument there there's this whole part
of the world that I never meet have you
ever met anybody who would say to you in
person you know I think the school
should make these decisions about the
the genitalia of your children and you
should probably not even be
involved but honestly if you ever heard
a real human being make that argument in
person like to you I've never heard of
it I have I have trouble believing it's
even real that there's somebody who
would make this argument but as we know
the school system the public school
system has failed this completely and
the teachers union is uh probably the
biggest problem
there all right uh there's a new AI app
that's a girlfriend app called angry
GF that gives you a an AI girlfriend
that is angry at you all the time it's
it's always uh complaining and yelling
at you and what you're supposed to do if
you're the guy is it's gamified so it's
like a game to figure out how to make
your AI girlfriend less
angry
so I don't know uh you know there are
going to be a lot of AI
girlfriends
um but I think I might lean toward the
one that's angry at me because I want
some
realism have you ever you know the
science of
addiction you can get addicted to things
if you have uh uh
unpredictable benefits
if you always get the same benefit for
what you do you just get used to it and
it's no longer addictive but if you're
not entirely sure if it's going to work
every time but sometimes it does you can
get real addicted to that like gambling
you know pulling a slot machine it's the
fact that it doesn't pay you very often
that makes it addictive then when it
does you're like oh I'm
magic so if you could get your AI angry
girlfriend to be less angry at you it
would feel like you had done something
uh this is either one of the best ideas
or the worst ideas in the world I'm not
sure you can tell yet but you might be
more addicted to the one that acts real
and is angry at you all the
time all
right uh Tesla is launching a new thing
where you can order food right from your
car uh and then you can pick it up when
you're at the supercharger
station now let me say that's an amazing
idea
don't you think how many people would
love to go to the
supercharger and and be able to like eat
their eat their meal on their lap that
they ordered and it came there at the
same time that seems like one of the
best things have you heard of people
taking naps at the
supercharger have you heard of people
falling asleep at the
supercharger I I have a friend who likes
to go to the supercharger because it's
the only time to get away from
everything
this like an actual enjoyable experience
go to the supercharger have a snack you
know listen to your phone a little bit a
lot of people usually like their their
getaway time so it's actually like more
of a plus than a minus didn't see that
coming well Bri bri. a br r y. a as you
know is the inventor and creator of the
orifice doai the sextoy for for mostly
men um
and he's got a trademarked slogan AI
women or
women now that might be the best slogan
I've ever heard AI women or
women it it's so
provocative it just makes me laugh every
time I see it because I know what it
does to other people when they see it
and that's just the funny
part anyway there's a uh the world's
first beauty pageant for AI woman so so
now you have a beauty pageant for AI
women you know real women they had a
good
run but uh you
know once the AI women look better and
they could complain too so now your AI
woman can look any way you want but can
also uh be angry at you that's sort of
everything you know if you've got an
orifice you've got the well you know
it's just
women had a good run now there's this
face swap the face swap Tech uh is so
good the scammers are pretending to be
other people as in pretending to be
women so men are pretended to be women
and online they actually can present as
women and they're getting in
relationships online and scamming
people so I'm thinking that some version
of this might have happened to me
already I think I told you that
uh one of my lawyers that I hadn't used
for a while called to ask me to confirm
if I had called them to ask to change my
address I had not called them to change
to to change my address but their
internal processes were good so instead
of believing the incoming call which by
the way had my name on it so my name was
on a phone call from a different state
and uh they asked them to change my
address address to some address at their
address for my legal stuff for my lawyer
stuff but they but the lawyer office was
smart enough to call the number that
they have for me to confirm and I said
no there's that never
happened and uh then the lawyer fired me
and
disengaged true
story got fired by my lawyer no it's a I
hadn't used them in a while so they dis
engaged I have a new lawyer
firm the new lawyer firm is
great uh the the old lawyer firm was in
San
Francisco do you think a San Francisco
uh lawyer can can stay working for me
nope the reason they gave is I haven't
used their services in a few years uh
but they didn't need a reason I'm sure
they would have canceled me
anyway it was San Francisco
so
um so Benny Johnson you probably know
Benny Johnson independent journalist
type see him on X all the time and
Alx also one of these independent
journalist types I guess the two of them
traveled to Oakland California to uh
where the first and only closed in
andout place is and if you didn't hear
the story In-N-Out is hugely successful
burger place and they had to close was
only one store ever recently and it was
in Oakland and it's because they had
just an immense amount of robberies
apparently people were getting robbed as
they were in sitting in their car in
line so Benny and
Alx uh drive the car with their all
their camera equipment and everything
and they park it near the In-N-Out there
famous for getting
robbed and within a few minutes their
car window was broken and somebody was
reaching to grab the
bag which sounds bad doesn't it that
somebody breaks into their car their
park car and and breaks a window and
grabs a bag no it's worse than that
because Alx was in the car when it
happened the car was parked but there
was still an adult human male in the
car so Alx ends up getting in a uh what
would you call a he's grabbing the bag
and trying to you know keep the guy from
getting it I guess he succeeded so he
actually beat off the robber um I don't
think he hit him but he managed to keep
the bag Al so all they lost was their
window so let me summarize this Benny
Johnson and Alx went to Oakland to the
place that was most famous for all the
robberies there and their car was broken
into and could have been could have been
I mean if that guy had been armed it
could have been literally
death now can anybody think of any
advice that I might have given them if
they had
asked suppose they said to me Scott
we're thinking of doing this segment and
we're going to drive our cars and we're
going to park next to that In-N-Out in
Oakland and we're going to do a segment
from
there imagine if they'd asked me for my
advice well what do you think I would
have said
I think I would have said get the
out of there no don't go there ever not
even for the news don't go there if you
have a medical appointment you know
don't get don't go there if it's an
emergency don't go there just to do a
story about it don't go there just stay
the away from Oakland it's it's
lost Oakland's lost you you don't go
there just to fix it it's gone
well the LA times has an article in
which they claimed that March this March
was the 17th warmest March and 130 years
of data records wow according to the uh
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration I think I usually call
them NASA instead of national when I
talk about them because I get that wrong
those letters but anyway uh that's the
official record of temperatures you know
the most official record
and uh and it says that the average
temperature was uh 3.6 de above average
wow so that that tells you a complete
and useful story about climate change
doesn't
it all right I'm just seeing if the
trolls are active trolls are active
today well um do you know the site
what's up with that the what's is
spelled
WTS named after the individual so that's
sort of a climate uh skepticism site and
here's what they left out so you can
trust the news can't you let me tell you
what the news left out and what they
left out is from the same
data so also from the literally the same
database the National Oceanic
Atmospheric
Administration right so here's something
they left out of that story and tell me
if you think it's important so the story
was the March is one of the the hottest
marches and it's a climate change
story is it important that they left out
the following
fact that the same
database um shows that the maximum
temperatures across the contiguous us
have been consistently declining since
March
2012 that's right the maximum
temperatures across the
US have been declining since 2012 do you
think that the story should have
mentioned that since it's a story about
everything getting
hot that the actual data says it's the
opposite they can actually point you to
the
data tell you the opposite of what the
data says and then make a story about
it and if you are if you're not reading
the you know the skeptical press
like the uh what's up with that site how
would you ever know that you wouldn't
know that you would literally think the
the world was burning up I told you the
story about the three billionaires who
are the ones behind the climate scare
they they got together some years ago it
was Bloomberg and Styer
and some other CEO and they put put
their own money in and their intention
was to scare you into some kind of
climate
action so they actually said we got to
scare people so here it is scare
away well Biden was out of speech and he
said and I quote are you ready to choose
Freedom over democracy because that's
America and everybody clapped they
actually heard him say do you want are
you ready to choose Freedom over
democracy which is you could say it's a
Freudian slip that we don't have democ
ocracy and he knows it and he's behind
it or he's just a crazy old dementia guy
or he just has a lot of gaffs and
doesn't mean anything but the fact that
everybody clapped for
that is more evidence that we live in a
subjective
reality right the LA Times reported the
opposite of what the data clearly
said nobody noticed Joe Biden said the
opposite of what the people in the
audience think is true and good and they
clapped for it they clapped for
it so yeah the reality is very
subjective and how about this China is
selling a you know I guess they a huge
seller of solar panels to the West at
the same time they're uh they've
overtaken France as the second largest
nuclear power in terms of nuclear energy
so China is selling us so panels but
building like crazy nuclear power plants
do you know why because nuclear power
plants are way better than
solar so they're selling us the bad
and they're keeping the good for
themselves now we're also trying to
build more nuclear power plants I will
give the Biden Administration credit
that they are serious about nuclear
power it looks like but we can't seem to
get it done here the US doesn't seem to
have a system that's
supporting nuclear
power um you all know Frank
luns political pollster bundit you see
him a lot Frank luns well he had a
stroke um and he was reporting on it on
X he's
62
and um he had a pretty bad stroke but he
says his brain is good and you know
he'll get he'll come
back how long did it take troll to come
up with his post from
2020 encouraging people to get
vaccinated you you want to hear how
terrible the world is the world is so
terrible that a guy goes public with his
health
problem and in one second a troll is
blaming him of not only killing people
by recommending vaccinations but maybe
having killed himself by getting
vaccinated now the part of the story you
don't
know is that it's the second stroke he's
had and the first one was in 2020 before
the
vaccinations so it's a second stroke the
first one
happened before the vaccination ugliness
so it's very unlikely it was vaccination
secondly he had a famous weight
problem um and a few years ago he lost a
bunch of weight but he he complains that
uh in a post he said I can't be this
hungry every hour of every day you know
I appreciate the compliments but I
appreciate food even more I can tolerate
the fat insults better than the hunger
so it may be that he ate himself back
into a poor health State I don't know if
the I don't know if the eating had
anything to do with anything but I would
just make this advice if you ever find
yourself suffering because your diet
you're doing the diet wrong
if you're suffering and you're hungry
you're doing it wrong now I write more
about this in my book had of failed
almost everything still wouldn't big
second addition but the idea is if you
know how to uh handle your your urges
you have the hunger part if you manage
that you don't have any hunger here's
the quick
explanation um I'm at my exact ideal
adult weight I wouldn't want to be one
pound more or one pound less that took
zero
effort but I came down about 12 lbs from
where I was just a year ago how did I do
that with zero effort all I did was eat
as much as I wanted of food that was
good for me any time I wanted as much as
I wanted whenever I wanted I was never
hungry for one second it turns out if
you don't eat processed foods and sugars
and in my case wheat seemed to be a
problem if you take out of your diet the
stuff that just isn't good for you you
you'd have trouble gaining weight if
you're moderately AC active I mean I'm
not running marathons or anything but
I'm you know do moderate workouts
regularly
so that's my advice you should take the
message from him if you don't learn
anything else that if you're suffering
because you're on a diet you're doing
the diet wrong that's the main thing you
need to know
all right um I saw a clip where Elon
Musk was explaining why the simulation
is
likely and uh he thought the odds of us
being in a simulation are billions to
one because certainly in our own
lifetime we'll be able to build
simulations in which there's an entire
world that thinks it's
real and so the odds that it hasn't
happened already are low he thinks it's
billions to ones that we are a
simulation and I think the same thing so
some somebody asked me um a few
questions uh elon's boots an account on
X said Can someone explain why it
matters the question is are we a
simulation or not a simulation that's a
good question why does it
matter well I would like to give you
this reason why it
matters I think if you know your ass
simulation you can author it and that's
what Elan mus does if you could be the
richest person on the entire planet and
all it took was thinking you're in a
simulation and acting that
way that's probably a pretty good
strategy now you're not going to be the
richest person necessarily but if you
act as though you have control of the
simulation I believe you
do and what could be more acting like
you control the simulation than starting
an electric car company that everybody
said was impossible and then starting a
rocky ship to Mars company that
everybody said it was impossible and
putting a chip in people's skull
everybody said it was a bad
idea everything Elon mus does is so
aggressively
impossible that you would have to think
you lived in a simulation to even try
those things you would have to think the
rules don't apply to you and he he lives
a life like the rules don't apply to
him so if you'd like to live a life
where it seem like the rules don't apply
then I would suggest that the uh frame
of the simulation is a good one because
it won't limit
you if you live in a world where there's
free will and everything is just what it
looks like then there are all these
things preventing you from getting what
you want and you could list them well
I'm I'm ugly so I can't get this person
as my mate I can't get that job because
I don't have the right background you
know if you think the world is just what
you see
then it's all limiting if you think that
you can author it as you go then you're
likely to try things that other people
aren't going to try doesn't mean they
all
work but certainly it would expand your
options so that's why I recommend it and
then I was asked Scott why do you
believe the simulation is real but you
don't believe UFOs are here wouldn't
they be similarly the same odds what do
you think are the odds that were a
simulation
the same as the odds of a UFO
visiting give me your
statistical uh Instinct on that same
odds the odds of us being a simulation
and the odds of UFOs and aliens visiting
the
Earth here's my take those are opposites
the the odds that were ass simulation I
agree with musk is in the range of
billions to one in favor billions to
one and and the logic supports that so
there's billions to one chance that
we're
simulation but if you look at the UFO
story it's in the category of things
that are almost never true so you're
comparing something like Bigfoot and
Loch nness Monster and
ghosts that's what the UFOs are in that
category with you know ghosts and
monsters under the bed so the odds that
there's a monster under your bed
tonight is almost
zero but then people say why do you say
it's zero and I say I never say that I
say I don't believe it there's no
evidence of it I doubt it'll happen but
nothing zero you know I mean you uo
could appear tomorrow and be a real
alien but those are opposites the odds
that the UFOs are real U are almost zero
the odds that we're in the simulation is
probably billions to one so they
couldn't be on further opposite ends of
probability could I be wrong sure sure
could that's what it looks like to
me all right I'm trying to understand my
uh my commenters on act who are sure
that every story can be explained by the
fact that somebody important in the
story is also
Jewish now and I see that with may orcus
you know whenever I say what what up
with mayorcas because the question I ask
is who's he working
for that's a real question not a not a
I'm not trying to score a point or
anything I actually wonder who is
mayorcas working for it's obviously not
the United States do we agree on that
well I mean we can be pretty sure that
mayorcas is not working for the benefit
of the
country I think that's like
clearly it could not be more obvious now
I don't I don't think there's any
evidence that by Biden's in
charge would you agree I think the
evidence suggests it's not Biden you
know some say it's his chief of staff
and some say it's you know some
combination of lobbyists and
whatnot but I'm trying to understand why
uh somebody thinks that Israel or a
Jewish conspiracy would care about
opening the border of the United States
when that would be the worst thing that
would could ever happen to Jews and to
Israel why why would mayus be working
for the Jews as people in my comments
are like to say why would he be working
for the Jews or for Israel to do the
thing that no Jew and nobody in Israel
wants which is us to be destroyed by
open borders does Israel want us to let
in a bunch of terrorists and stuff and
destroy the country so that we can't
support them
anymore I don't think so I'm pretty sure
that Israel wants the United States to
be as strong as possible because we're
basically their
defense I mean we're the you know the
augmented extra big brother
defense so I wish your conspiracy
theories would have some internal and
integrity meaning at least can you
connect the
dots and if the best you have is that
Jewish people who are notoriously good
at
school also have a lot of good jobs
I'm getting the all caps people who are
having cognitive dissonance in all caps
somebody's yelling dude you are so
clueless in all
caps I'm asking you to connect the dots
I'm not saying I understand it I'm
saying I don't understand it and for
some reason nobody can explain
it so can you explain to me why Israel
or the Jewish population in America
would want to destroy America with
immigration
can you make any sense of
that I'm I'm not saying it's not
happening uh you got fent to answer but
you didn't watch it I'm not going to I'm
not going to watch
fent because I'll get on a
list if if I watch Fones then the CIA
and the FBI will be after me so it's not
safe can can follow the money follow the
money to whom
so why is it you can't explain
it yeah why can't you explain in the
comments in one sentence who wants who
who in the Jewish Community anywhere
wants our border to be
open and why that's good for them say it
in one
sentence can
you you can't do it can you and neither
can forent is because it's not a
thing yeah the reason you can't explain
it is cuz it doesn't make sense
the reason you have to say you have to
go to somebody else to explain it is
because you don't understand it if you
understood it you would just tell me
what it
is right you'd say something like uh
George Soros is evil they all work for
him and he's just evil like I don't
believe that's exactly what's going
on but all all I'm saying is that that
no argument has been made so if you
think disagreeing with the argument
you're hearing it wrong I'm saying no
argument has been made but you're very
insistent that it it has been
made I'm not even disagreeing with it it
hasn't been made there is no argument to
disagree with You're simply screaming
something is the case with no evidence
except that uh people who are good at
school have good jobs that's your only
evidence people who are good to school
have good jobs and everything else
follows from that
y but here's here's what's not a reason
why does 2 + 2 equal four Nick
Fuentes why does gravity exist Nick
Fuentes how about saying his name is not
an
explanation that's not a reason that's a
name of a
person so so basically I'm seeing are
insults about mayorcas there's a Cuban
secular Jew and a Marxist and you think
that they a that because he's a
Marxist that's a different story than a
Jewish um some kind of Jewish conspiracy
so are have you changed it from it's a
Jewish conspiracy to now it's a Marxist
conspiracy are you saying that all
marxists are
Jews like black lives matter see I all
I'm asking is for for your point of view
to be coherent and then I can engage
it and hear somebody was trying to tie
it back to something I said about the
pandemic because I don't have any
response if you if you can see the
comments some of you are listening to it
you can't see the comments but the
comments are
just people actually going
nuts because they're sure that it should
be obvious but they can't put it in
words
so nobody can tell me in any sentence
how any of this makes
sense Jews tend to be
marxists so you think that there's a Glo
Global
Marxist thing so it's not about
Jews so some of you are changing it now
so some of you are saying it's not it's
not the Jews it's the marxists and that
coincidentally a lot of Jews are
marxists now that's what you're saying
but but you see that you don't have any
coherent point of view
right if you think it's a Jewish
conspiracy then none of you have
suggested anything that would support
that point of view you can see it in the
comments the the best you had is yelling
in all caps there somebody else that I'm
not going to listen to has a reason but
you can't tell me what that reason
is all
right uh wikip IIA which used to be run
by the new CEO neest CEO of NPR who's
under Fire for being a
woker um Christopher rufo has taken the
lead on this uh Mission he talked to
Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger who
says that Wikipedia has been
ideologically
corrupted um he floated the possibility
that Katherine Maher who's the now the
NPR CEO collaborated with us
intelligence
to manipulate the information on
Wikipedia and says that if NPR were
committed to truth it would fire her
right away so that's even a founder of
Wikipedia saying that she's a
disaster now I've been listening to a
lot of her old speeches and stuff and
she does look bad
crazy like like she looks like somebody
who's just got all the jargon and talked
yourself into a top position by just
saying all the right stuff about how
white people are
terrible made it very popular so that
the more you can say white people are
terrible the more you can get promoted
to the top jobs
apparently anyway so it's sort of an
amazing that NPR has decided to go down
with the ship so rather than get rid of
their CEO who's obviously a gigantic
liability at this point they've decided
that their wokeness is too important and
they're going to take down all of NPR so
now there's a a bill being uh floated in
the Congress to defund NPR I'm very in
favor of that I don't think NPR can be
fixed I think it should just be
canned what do you think I think NPR
should just be turned off it's
useless and why is the government paying
for news anyway what what like why did
that ever become a
thing should there be any government
funded news maybe there shouldn't be
maybe that's just a bad idea in the
first
place all right get rid of
NPR uh China is ordered Apple to get rid
of its messaging apps so if you're in
China you will no longer be able to use
a WhatsApp
threads um signal or telegram why do you
think that China is Banning those
encrypted message
apps why do you
think well could it be because the
founder of uh is it telegram said that
the US tried to hire one of their
Engineers to work for them secretly to
give the uh CIA access to their
encrypted
data could it be that China just
realized that maybe China doesn't have
access to these encrypted uh things but
maybe the US does so I don't think China
would be smart to have a bunch of
encrypted apps in China if they just saw
a story that says the United States can
easily get into them just by paying
somebody who already works there to give
them access to the back
door if you were China and you didn't
personally have access to the back door
and you thought America did you would
ban that right away we would right
if it were the other way around if we
thought China was into all those
encrypted apps but the US couldn't get
in we'd ban it right away so of course
they banned
it do you remember me telling you that
there's no such thing as an encrypted
app I mean not in the real world that
that anybody at a state level anybody
wanted to get in could get in
probably
yeah all
right
um in the comments people are still
having a heart
attack I'm seeing it going all all the
way back to the Roth child to connect to
mayorcas if you if you have to go to the
Roth child to connect to
mayorcas yeah you can't let that
go there's nothing about that that looks
a little bit crazy to you when you say
it not at all
okay all right uh raspon talking about
voter excitement you know the enthusiasm
of the voters can determine if they show
up and more Republicans are enthusiastic
about the upcoming election than
Democrats so Republicans 68% of them are
excited to vote and Democrats only half
of them it's pretty big
difference now again I say to
you
um do you think that I just don't
understand what's going on it seems like
every single indicator is pro
Trump but that the polling is actually
narrowing
everything from the
um the news cycle that seems more
positive Trump because he's using his
laware stuff in his favor uh people like
Trump on the economy people like Trump
on War people like Trump on the
border and now that more enthusiastic
about
voting and the race is
narrowing nothing is real is
it like what what whatever is causing
this race to narrow could that possibly
be the actual
voters
did do you think that
maybe that is it possible that most of
the polling is just made
up is that what's
happening I'm having real trouble
believing that the that this is
close it's weird I know it's all
suspicious looking to me
well as you know many Trump uh lawyers
and advisers at one point have gone to
jail the I saw Rachel matow give the
list of trump advisors and lawyers that
have now been disbarred or sent to jail
now the MSNBC take is that if so many of
your lawyers and advisers have gone to
jail what does that tell
you well the MSNBC take is if that many
of your advisors and your lawyers are
going to
jail that's pretty good evidence that
Trump himself is a big old crooked dope
am I right I mean how could one person
have so many people who are advisors and
lawyers go to jail unless the person
himself was were
corrupt or there's a massive obvious
lawfare campaign that is very clearly
and everybody can see it taking out
everybody around Trump one way or
another so what she left out was all the
people have been cancelled so she could
have put the rosean and the infow wars
she could have thrown me in there right
so if you look at the entire picture
it's clear that the government has
weaponized against one part of the
country so that's the real story that
the weaponization has caused all the
lawyers to get taken down let me give
you an example
Sydney Powell uh was accused of bringing
frivolous lawsuits in several States um
regarding the 2020 election so she got
uh
disbarred um she got yeah they disbar
her for what they called these frivolous
actions but uh now she has a legal
victory in Texas after an appell Court
ruled that the State Bar failed to prove
that she engaged in fraud dishonesty
deceit or
misconduct in other words they could not
show anything except she she believed
that the election had been rigged all
evidence
showed that she believed the election
had been rigged now if she believed the
election had genuinely be rigged then
everything she did was ethical moral and
right on point for her job as an
attorney if if she knew it was a real
election which nobody could know that
was an unknowable thing then it was
weasle and the bar had a good case
against her but imagine if you will a
bunch of lawyers
lawyers people who should see things a
little bit more clearly than the rest of
us a bunch of lawyers
believed that they knew the election was
clean just think about that could they
have known
that do you think it was knowable by the
fact that nobody had found proof it
wasn't
clean no lawyers do know that just the
fact you haven't found the evidence does
not mean the crime does not exist every
lawyer knows that but why did all the
lawyers act in a way that was the
opposite of what they all knew to be
true which is the Sydney pow couldn't
possibly know that the election was
clean because it's not a knowable thing
well obviously they were acting
politically and that's why um I assume
time went by and people could see more
clearly and so she wins now I would
argue that the other Trump lawyers who
went to jail or got disbarred so you got
Eastman and um I think there's another
one doesn't the fact that all of them
acted in what appeared to be a genuine
belief that they were acting legally
and that there was a reason to do it
meaning that there was you know great
suspicion and it was justified about the
election to me it looks like every one
of these lawyers believed the election
was rigged and believed that they were
following a path that was legal
enough and moral and ethical
enough here's what I think if the
lawyers are going to
jail that
proves that Trump had advice from
lawyers to do everything he did that is
completely exculpatory in my
opinion if you told me Trump told the
lawyers to do an illegal thing I'd say
oh that's bad you know maybe you should
go to jail for that but if the lawyers
told
Trump that what they were doing would
pass legal
muster that's on the
lawyers and the lawyers also were right
meaning that they probably had a legal
path in their opinion it may may have
been risky but within the legal you know
risk reward parameters that they they
operated and that I would say that the
the certainty of the lawyers such as
Sydney Powell that she was doing the
right thing is 100% exculpatory to the
principal who is Trump if the lawyers
all thought it was legal and apparently
they did there's no evidence they didn't
by the way nobody has ever produced
give me a fact check but I think this is
true nobody's ever produced uh a
witness a direct witness or uh a
document like an email or a message that
would suggest that anybody didn't
believe the election was rigged when
when they acted as though they believed
it was rigged they actually believed it
and I think that was obvious from the
start that they actually believed it so
the The hoax was that they didn't
believe
it and the news and the people and the
Democrats are so powerful in their
persuasion that they convinced us they
could read the minds of strangers and
saw that they were lying just by looking
inside their minds they couldn't tell
they were
lying by looking at any documents or any
witnesses there was no evidence so
instead they used their mind reading and
said H they definitely know it's not
true but they're acting like it is true
and that's unethical got a dispar them
that was
insane yeah so I would say all of the
people going to jail are proof that the
system is broken not that Trump is
broken speaking of which uh there's now
some uh
evidence um that the FBI was trying to
link white supremacist with Islamic
extremists and was making the case that
they were going to team up let me say
that again because you probably think I
misspoke the
FBI was at least in documents that have
been uncovered uh was pushing the
idea that the white supremacists were
going to link up with the Islamic
extremists to become one Mighty
extremist terrorist
group that's right the
FBI thought that white extremists were
going to team up with the Islamic
terrorists the
FBI thought white
supremacists were going to team up with
Islamic
terrorists all I can say is either the
FBI has never met a white
supremacist or maybe even a white person
ever to ask him whether this is bad
crazy or not no this is bad crazy
now Mike Ben says it's not so crazy as
it is a op and the op would be if you
can tie these things together then you
can use all of your anti-terrorist tools
against Trump
supporters do you see the play if you
can make the
case that you might have a problem with
white supremacist teaming up with
Islamic militants then all of the tools
that you could use against Islamic
militants can be used domestically
against um Trump supporters because you
can just say they're white supremacists
well they're Trump supporters so they're
probably white supremacists and if
they're white supremacists there's a
good chance they're working with Islamic
terrorists and if they're working with
Islamic terrorists it's the greatest
risk to our country and we can use all
of our military tools to stop it it's an
OP or the beginning of an OP or
something like it so yes every
everything that's in politics is bad
people on the Democrats and in the Intel
organization trying to pull an op on the
country there's basically nothing but
Ops and hoaxes the the entire structure
of what you believe about the country is
nothing but hoaxes it's just one hoax
after another that's all it
is speaking of hoaxes you you do know
that the January 6 narrative has
completely collapsed right so now that
we have whistleblowers who confirm that
Trump uh authorized 10,000 uh n um
National Guard which is it uh yeah
National Guard so we know that Trump
pre-authorized 10,000 National Guard
which guarantees he was not trying to do
some kind of a takeover guarantees there
is no way both those can be true and we
know one of them is true so if one of
them is true the other one's definitely
not true and what's what definitely not
true is that nobody nobody authorizes
the military to act against
themselves that's what the Democrats
have sold the country that Trump
activated the national guard against
himself against this Insurrection they
say he was planning so he planned an
Insurrection but also planned a military
to thwart it and that's what that's what
their idiot uh supporters think
is actually
happened I mean you have to be really
dumb to think that he authorized the
military to thwart his own takeover of
the country I mean you have to be super
dumb to to buy into that
oax but most of the country
did because we got a super dumb
country um and this is another case
where the government is running non-stop
Ops so January 6 was just an OP whatever
is happening at the border is clearly
not what we're being told it's some kind
of op uh definitely whatever is
happening with this FBI and white
supremacist and Islamic terrorists that
certainly looks like an OP all these
legal lawfare stuff against Trump is an
OP all the Trump lawyers being taken
down by the bars those are all ops none
of this is a normal country operating
normally this is all this is all the
dark elements of your uh of your
government operating against you the
public so the the government has turned
against the public in a major
way but of course they have the uh press
to cover for him here's a story in axios
that says here's here's the uh post from
axios says CEO Jamie Diamond uh actually
talked about JP Morgan Chase's
commitment to diversity Equity inclusion
in his recent shareholder letter his
words stand out at a time when most Co
CEOs have gone silent or openly hostile
on these programs so if you saw that
headline or that post you'd say huh
Jamie Diamond one of the most important
um executive business people in the
whole country people really do pay
attention to what he says and they
should because he's a super smart
well-meaning person who does seem to
want what's best for the country now
politically I think he's probably a
Democrat but he's also said things that
are just common sense about closing the
border and you know give up on your
Trump derangement syndrome and stuff
like that very very uh sane Democrat
point of view which I totally appreciate
like even if I might disagree on an
element or two a sane Democrat who
understands what TDs is and doesn't have
it you can be my friend all day long
right I love that even if I disagree on
some policies
I don't know if I do actually I I might
agree with Jamie Diamond on just about
everything I don't know
but do you think that that
characterization fits what actually
happened in the real world no it's the
opposite the headline in the post I read
are the opposite of what happened Jamie
Diamond did not come out in favor of
Dei he did not use the words Dei he used
words that you and I probably agree with
whereas you wouldn't agree with Dei many
of you let's see if you agree with this
he says that they want to continue doing
Outreach to um to increase the diversity
of their Workforce Outreach so in other
words they would
recruit with a very intentional purpose
of making sure they they got the right
diversity is that a problem
recruiting recruiting is about
opportunity
now if he's doing it right and I have no
reason to think he's not then that just
means he's making sure everybody sees
the opportunity and the bank doesn't
miss anybody who' be good and that's
about
opportunity that's the way he phrased it
I mean if you look at his words it's
about opportunity that's the opposite of
Dei Dei is about Equity it's built right
into the phrase the E is equity Equity
is not about opportunity Equity is about
outcome is very specifically about
outcome so he has run away from Dei he
has not embraced it and he's run to
exactly the trumpian kind of view that
there's no problem with Outreach does
anybody have a problem with that if if a
bank thinks that they're better off
doing a little extra to make sure that
they got let's say communities that have
been underserved in the past does
anybody have a problem with that I I've
never had a problem with that because
opportunity well I'm all for it I just
don't like them forcing lesser qualified
people into the system just for Equity
that would be my issue but no
opportunity yes as much as possible it's
all good it's your money they want to
spend it on that that's great so yeah
the headline doesn't match the story so
that's an
OP
um Thomas Massie is talking about uh
speaker Johnson we're I think we're all
confused about what's going on with
speaker Johnson I can't tell if he's a
Democrat or Republican at this point I
mean you really
can't yeah
um so he says that the Rules Committee
just voted for the rule uh to bring
the100 billion foreign aid supplemental
now I think that's the one that gives
money to Taiwan for Taiwan Ukraine and
Israel and they they're trying to put
put the Tik Tock ban in there and
something the repo act I forget what
that is so they put all these things
together but one thing they didn't do is
put in any money to secure the
Border in the real world this is
happening but let me just say this
without that commentary and see if your
head explodes this is just explaining
the facts right no opinion put
on the the Speaker of the House who
would be the top elected Republican at
the moment so the top elected Republican
well unless you yeah I guess I guess you
could argue he the top at the moment
um he's getting money for three Foreign
Wars or potential war in Taiwan I
suppose
and he is not asking for any money to
secure the
Border does that even sound like a
republican I mean maybe oldtime
Republican when Republicans lik Wars but
it doesn't sound like a modern
Republican you know giving giving your
money away without taking care of your
own country first and and Massie is
doing a good job of just uh pointing out
the absurdity of the process I guess uh
the speakers using some Democrats to get
things pushed through because the
Republicans couldn't get it done and
whatever whatever uh Johnson is doing
appears to be connected to some
something he had learned in an
intelligence briefing that he can't tell
us every part of this is sketchy and
wrong and smells wrong there there's not
a single thing about this that feels
right and they're doing it right in
front of you but we don't know why
they're doing it because remember the
the the secret knowledge that Johnson
claims to have can't tell us so it's
basically a trust me
thing in the comments somebody said in
the comments somebody saying maybe he's
Jewish I assume that's a joke and I call
back to the earlier
conversation I'm going to assume
charitably that that was a joke because
I think it
was all right ladies and
gentlemen could it be the aliens did
they tell them the aliens are coming and
we better protect Taiwan because the
aliens are going to take it I don't know
what that's all
about how is it that the US dollar is so
strong compared to other currencies
so I saw that
today how does that work shouldn't the
US dollar be the one that's inflating
into
nothing how how is our dollar gaining
ground on other
currencies well nothing really makes
sense does it I don't really understand
that oh I did under I did figure out
something that I heard um let me just
give a clarification so last night in
the manave and I think I've said this on
the Regular Show um I said there was
something I didn't understand and then
in the comments people explained it to
me so I'll explain it to you the thing I
couldn't understand is why so many
people were saying the mrni the
MRNA vaccination was bad for you people
say at the same time that the people
working on it are doubling down their
mRNA research to use for other kinds of
things besides Co so I said how can it
be that the the scientific Community is
working so hard at the things so many of
you say is clearly a dangerous thing and
all the data shows it so here's what I
learned when people say the MRNA
vaccination is what is hurting people
they're using the wrong words so that's
where I got confused what they should
have said is that the MRNA platform is a
delivery vehicle
but what it delivers is the important
part so if it someday delivers something
that cures cancer maybe that's good but
if it delivers a spike Protein that's
supposed to be part of the covid
solution and the spike protein is
problem then it's the spike protein this
problem not the
MRNA so am I
close that the MRNA if if you're saying
you don't want some medical thing to
happen
it would be more accurate that it's what
the platform delivers to your body not
the platform not the delivery vehicle do
you buy
that yeah this stuff is hard to
understand if you're not you know an
expert in that field so all of us are
trying to just figure it out I think
that sounds right so if you're going to
say that
um yeah and then bunch of people are
saying no so then other people are
saying that the MRNA platform is the
problem so I guess with I guess there's
literally nothing we can understand in
the real world is
there it did my show make the case that
reality is
subjective everything I talked about
today was things that people have two
views of and they're positive they're
view is right and they're just
opposites check the live government to
see the voting on Ukraine money well
it's the voting for all the money right
it's one
bill first you must know what RNA and
DNA are no first I must not know
that all
right
um this is about you resisting info from
Malone I don't even know what that means
so it's not about
that all right let me ask you this
question how many of you still believe
that Elite athletes were dropping dead
from
vaccinations how many of you still think
that really happened
looking in the
comments a lot of people think that
happened yeah it's probably the the most
debunked part of the whole pandemic
narrative but a lot of people still
think it
happened now I won't rule out that it
happened uh and there's something wrong
with the debunk but no I I I think that
one I'd give that a
9010 90% chance it didn't
happen now people are just yelling
insults at
me yeah now if you believe that one
um just look for the
debugs if if you've been fed a continual
stream of athletes are dying and here's
another uh evidence of it it would make
sense that you believed it if that's all
you saw but you're but you're having a
documentary
effect so remember the documentary
effect is if you saw one set of
information all the time it would be
very convincing even if it were not
real so if you had the same experience I
did you saw a Non-Stop diet of of
athletes dying and people saying it was
vaccination
but I also saw the
debunks so if you never saw the detailed
debunk of those
stories then you don't really have any
basis to know one way or the
other uh let me see what's it muli
what muli talked with Tucker about this
before Tucker got cancelled yeah and but
I think I think molof was one of the
people saying it
and
uh you bought the
propaganda Well here here's all I'm
asking is there anybody is there anybody
who's seen the detailed
debunk and also you seen the claims who
thinks the claims are still true after
seeing the debunks if you haven't seen
the
debunks but you've only seen the claims
don't talk to me on this topic just
don't talk to me if you haven't seen
them now I'm not saying that means the
debunks are right I'm saying that I've
seen both and one of them is way more
convincing than the
other but that could be a persuasion
effect too so I give it a
9010 that it didn't
happen because if it did happen it's all
we'd be talking about and instead it's
just a
little a little population of people who
haven't seen the debunk basically
all
right looks like our comments have
stopped on this platform all right
ladies and gentlemen I'm going to go
talk to the locals people privately
because they get a little extra so I'm
going to say bye to the regular stream
uh if you're on locals stay where you
are if you're watching it now because
this stream will turn into your private
stream as soon as I get as soon as I say
goodbye to the other
platforms bye to the other platforms
after I push a couple of
buttons
