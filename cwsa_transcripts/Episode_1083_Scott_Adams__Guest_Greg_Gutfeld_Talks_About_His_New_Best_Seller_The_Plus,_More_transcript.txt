well let's see if this works
um that's the first time this happened i
got kicked off
i got kicked off but i'm back
apparently i'm unstoppable uh it's
possible that this will help me connect
with
greg gaffeld
and i swear to god this is gonna work
um well maybe not
anyway um we did the simultaneous sip
right before i got kicked off if we have
any technological luck and it looks like
we're gonna have some difficulty day
today i wanted to talk to greg guffeld
but if i don't do it today i'll
figure out another another time it works
so greg
if you can either
retry your device
or
well i think today will be the last time
i ever try to use
periscope for a guest i think i've made
a decision
that today will be the last time i ever
try to use this technology
live to bring out a guest those of you
who watch i think my
my accuracy has been something like 50
maybe uh
let me just try one more time
all right so greg i've got my d on
i'm looking at my twitter dm if uh if it
looks like it's not going to work just
send me a message
on twitter i've got that open and i'll
see it as soon as you send it
but let me talk about some other things
while we're doing that and by the way
the plus you should see the reviews for
this like
it's killing it's a it's a number one
self-help book on amazon
it's a number two self-help book on new
york times
the reviews are ridiculous you got a
got a trump uh got a trump retweet
that's pretty nice and uh and i think he
has a
part of his book tour will be
at a drive-in theater we'll ask them
about that if we get them
anyway um while we see if that's going
to happen
let me talk about another thing have you
ever
have you ever noticed that there are
some words that are used in the
political realm
that are really more powerful than other
words and there's a word that the
anti-trumpers are using
about trump and his in his performance
for the
coronavirus which is really it's a
really good one
they use the word botched have you heard
that
it's sort of the one that they keep
repeating and i gotta say
i think i'm gonna adopt that trick
because i never
i never thought about it before but if
you say
somebody didn't do a good job
they might say well we did or or we
didn't
but if you say somebody botched
something
it seems entirely different doesn't it
hey i think greg's back
let's see if this works greg you are
live
amazing
palpitations because the technology was
not giving you what you needed
yes and plus i was on my fourth uh uh
spontaneous sip or
uh i i had my f i'm on my fourth coffee
you've over you've opened it yes
so i don't know if you heard but i was
giving you the giving them the rundown
on your amazing book
thank you and i i'm i'm just blown away
at the both the reviews you're getting
from this
and you've got a presidential retweet
it's screaming up the charts number two
in new york times
and by the way the number one book
that's ahead of you
it doesn't belong there i've never heard
of it but apparently it's very popular
but they keep it there
because it was there for months it came
out in october
not 2019. yeah the new york times list
has um
i have some let's say algorithmic
irregularities if you will
anyway uh are you still there oh
 we lost him
this is the worst technology in the
world
all right i'll keep an eye on see if it
comes back um
i think i think we we deserve at least
one more try
if your technology can can produce
is possible that the gods are working
against this day
all right uh so i was there he is
this is totally going to work this is
totally going to work
are like let me jump right into this
yeah okay yes
yeah i i want to ask you the the dumbest
question
that a anybody ever asked because this
is this one i get sometimes
i want to see if you've ever gotten this
at the end of the book interview they'll
say to the author
uh so greg where can people buy this
book
that is the that is the local news
staple
of every interview also i had i had a
great
interview and i'm not going to mention
who the person is because she was very
nice but did that thing you talk about
where they don't read the book but they
just kind of open up the book
and they just and they just go like uh
so and then she reads the chapter
heading
so yeah the prison of two ideas i found
that interesting
tell us about it and then you just do it
and it's just like
and then she did it again and then she
was like well this was really a great
book and then that was and then it's
where can you pick it up
it's wonderful and you you write in a
similar
uh fashion you have the same problem i
do that a lot of authors will write a
book that has one theme
so you can always speak to it but you
you hit like
hundreds and hundreds of points if they
pick one out
not only does it misrepresent what your
book is
yeah because people think oh i heard
that one story
that about that one point and i you know
and then they make a decision based on
that one point
i would say that you have the kind of
book that has to be read in full
because it's more like an experience of
reading the book than it is about
you know all right so wait can i tell
you a funny thing though about it though
please
please do yeah okay so i have a hard
time
explaining what the book is about and
i've always been that way with almost
every book that i do because i was so
close to it
so when i when i get interviewed by
people they often do it better than i
did
like walter kern interviewed me and
described it as
it's a book about impulse control and i
never thought of that
but the the actual plus thing is is for
people
who have options and they and they
and they forgot what impulse control
really is
oh frick we lost him again
can you believe that unfrickin
believable now i don't know what is
causing
these calls to drop but
it is it is crazy
i'm not even sure why this is a
commercial product at this point
or at least this feature of it i like
the periscope part but not the uh
the guest part let's see if he's back
there we go
act like you weren't even cut off and
you're starting right in the middle of
the sentence go
and that is why they threw me in jail
scott and i
swore it was all in self-defense
and i found my pants an hour later
but that wasn't was that a great story
scott it was uh
not only self-defense but he had it
coming and
that's what happens when you have a
relationship with a duck
[Laughter]
all right so uh you're you're saying how
other people are characterizing your
book i i had one for you
it's it's how to uh how to deal with
your reflex for negativity
yes that is really good uh
basically a lot of reframing well this
is the negative thing you're doing
you know why once you reframe it this
way etc
uh let me let me tell you my uh my
favorite
part of this uh every once in a while
you read like one sentence
that just just sort of really speaks to
you this was one sentence
i'm paraphrasing a little bit yeah but
it said no matter uh
before you do something dumb ask
yourself how you were feeling
yes yeah just to say something about
that
well it's because i realize and it's
been in the last couple years
especially when i'm listening to the uh
your periscopes that almost
everything i do is judged by my current
state or mood
so like if i'm in a bad mood i don't
really know i'm in a bad mood
and then i do something and i go why did
i do that i was in a bad mood so i might
say something
negative to a friend or to the spouse or
uh on twitter and it's like why am i
doing this and then
so i i wait i wait until the mood passes
and then i never and then i lose
interest in what i was going to do
i i feel like to that point i feel like
the people with the highest levels of
awareness
are the ones who have realized that they
have been different people at different
times
yeah like angry you drunk you tired you
hungry they're all different use and if
you've done you know mushrooms or
something that's like a whole different
you
and then and and yeah that's that's one
of the great things you learn
as you get older how many used there
really are
the hungry you the hungry you is often
the worst you because you become like a
child especially i do
if i don't have anything to eat i am uh
i'm just
an animal and i'm the worst kind of greg
is that is the hungry greg
yeah listening to somebody else's long
boring story
is the worst thing when you're hungry
hungry yes it's like two things you
don't want to do
don't buy groceries don't listen to the
long stories
it's true i also like this step you know
no matter how you're doing someone is
doing worse today
yes as funny as that sounds that's a
real thing
it is i i really use that you say more
about that
well yeah i mean it's it's um for
example so
two trees fell uh outside my house uh
yesterday or two days ago just two days
ago two days ago because of the storm
so i couldn't leave in order for me to
leave my house i had to try
to go through somebody's backyard two
backyards over
uh down power lines to get down to a van
to do the five because the five couldn't
get up the hill other the five van
couldn't get up the hill
i'm doing all the shows from a van in my
driveway so i get down there and i'm
going like oh this sucks
this i'm screwed but then i'm looking at
my neighbor a giant tree
has landed on her um tesla
completely destroyed her tesla and uh
and
she's laughing she's actually got a
pretty good uh sense of humor
and i'm and she's going she said to
herself i was almost
in my car and so i'm going back to this
and i'm going like okay that's worse
than what i went through
and it could have been work and it could
have been worse for her so there's all
these different
levels of worsening right there's
there's somebody in
africa right now who's saying a tree
fell under tesla
i do not feel bad for her yeah exactly
yeah i do not feel bad
but but she looked at the card she said
100 deductible
you know life goes on so that was i mean
it's like i tend to
i'm a catastrophic thinker about i mean
everything
and but i realize it's passing and
that's the most important thing that
almost all my errors are due to the fact
that i can't interpret my moods
correctly
yeah i i would say that's
safe for me um now you
you have a uh an event at a drive-in
theater
coming yes which is which is the coolest
sounding thing i'm so jealous of that
because if anybody who does book tours
knows there's a sameness about them
yeah it's just the same freaking thing
over and over again but tell us about
the drive-in
so the drive-in is yarmouth drive-in in
massachusetts they're going to have
because of social distancing
basically the cars are going to keep
people separated but they can get out of
their cars
i think it's like 450 cars i will be on
stage there'll be
movie screens and speakers so i'll just
be doing a show like i normally do when
i'm traveling with tom chalu tomsulu
usually opens
the one thing that concerns me is how do
you tell jokes if you can't hear the
response
but i'm told people will be out of their
car so you'll hear the laughter
which will be important because i don't
know how you talk and then there's just
silence but
apparently it's worked out really well
but that's yeah so it's going to be like
it's going to be basically a drive-in
comedy show
yeah i i've had situations like that
where you just have to like live in your
own head
and imagine laughter it's like imagine
somebody was laughing at that
yeah i do that a lot
so so are you finding that trying to uh
to you know promote a book during a
pandemic did it help or hurt
because there's there's something i mean
the book is obviously getting lots of
attention and and doing
great and i feel like because you're uh
you're a
tv kind of a guy anyway does this
actually help you do you think
i think so i think it's the same kind of
logic that worked with covid in the
protest when they did they said oh look
the protests coat didn't spread kovas
koved and then you hear that it's
because
all the people were staying home away
from the protesters so it's like
there's a weird kind of they cancel each
other out so everybody's stuck at
everybody's stuck at home which means
they're bored which means maybe they'll
buy the book right but they won't go out
into a signing
but i think it all camp everybody's in
the same boat
so nobody's got an edge over everybody
else if they're all being kind of
punished the same way
and i think that like you know i mean
our ratings have gone up so that means
more people are watching me talk about
the book
so that helps wow speaking of speaking
of
ratings you're you're like leading in
both of your time slots right on the
five and also the greg guffeld show
yeah it's been it's been crazy in fact
on saturdays generally
that we win the entire demo for the
whole night like so we beat people at
seven o'clock
on cnn uh there are times when we beat
stuff on regular network
and then um the five has always been a
monster i mean it's
it's insane how and it pulls in prime
time
ratings at 5 p.m it's caused msnbc to
completely revamp their lineup i don't
know if you notice that they
they pushed uh what's the dude with the
goatees
they uh that guy from i can't think of
his name it doesn't matter
he doesn't exactly he's gone and they
just they
now they expanded the four o'clock to
six o'clock just just to fight the five
which is hilarious i i always like to
give a shout out to
the producers of the five no i know i
know you
like sometimes will make fun of the
staff and stuff just just to have jokes
yeah i i gotta say that is the best
produced
show i mean it just screams somebody's
good at that
and it has to do with even how they put
the personalities together
yeah it's it's the chemistry and and to
reproduce that i'd have to know is
it's just really amazing work i would
say i i just thought of the name chuck
todd but no you're right about the
producing and and the five is hard
because it's like it's not like you have
one anchor
you know you got to deal with five
babies because every now i'm actually a
baby i don't think
nobody i'm more of a baby than probably
most of them because of
uh i'm just more neurotic but you have
to deal with five different people
and you got to figure out which works
and keep it light while having it
serious
that kind of thing well you've got the
other thing that fox does is that you
have personalities
like when you guys are fighting on the
five it
it feels like oh my god that's that's
what real people would say
right they were in that chair if nobody
was watching that's what you'd say
but but we're all watching so i've often
said that what makes
anything good in entertainment is a
sense of danger
and it's there it is there you know i
don't know i mean you've
i don't know if you watch it when i've
got like but i'll be shaking at some
point
like because because that means that
that was completely improvised and
it came out without it came out before i
was done thinking you know
right yeah and uh and i gotta say as
much as juan you know
gets like beat up by by the other
co-hosts and as much as the the audience
likes uh making fun of him
he's really perfect for that job like
the the chemistry i mean because he's a
good soul
and and obviously it's his job to
represent a point of view
and uh he does a great job of it in
terms of his
how he fits with the group it just
couldn't be better yeah
i can't wait to get back into the table
scenario and i and i i hope that soon
because
i i i compare it to going from like
playing a game of pickup basketball to
going to a batting cage where
everybody's in their own batting cage
and so when you're when you're um when
you're asked a question it's like you're
taking your big swing
and you're not really talking and i it
it kind of drives me a little crazy
because i feel like we're in these
separated little pods and it reduces the
conversation so i think that
once we get back to normal i think it's
going to be great because it really
hurts
in my opinion hurts the chemistry a
little yeah you know i would say
like probably uh 40 of what makes your
show
work the five is people talking over
each other yeah
exactly and then then you add the
satellite delay and it just
you're like it it's getting really hard
to watch the
live shows where the the host and the
interviewer are talking over each other
because of the delay
right and you know when i do tucker's
show the one thing i
i promise myself is when tucker says he
doesn't have a delay
but what tuck what tucker says he
introduces you
don't say oh glad to be here cause he's
gonna talk over you
exactly like i was really proud i'm not
gonna do that i'm gonna be the only
only guest he's ever had who's not going
to talk over it and i just sit there
silently thinking like i'm a champion
yeah it's so important because when you
do the thing like thanks for having me
somebody will stop and go we'll hear
that and then come back and go
well uh i'm glad you're here and then
and then the person might say
thanks and then it goes it can go on for
it can go on for like a minute and it's
it's just
it drives it just makes everything start
off on a bad foot
and you just want it to end
all right all right so i know you've got
a lot more to do today
um yeah i've got relatives in town so
i'm taking today off i'm actually not
gonna be on the five because uh
my sister flew in during the uh tropical
storm
so i'm gonna go uh uh show her around
town or what's left of new york actually
and um before before you go the last
question
this is a this will be a science a
science question
usually of jack basobic it goes like
this
if you have more than one goose it's a
gaggle
of geese right if you have more than one
crow
it's a murderer right what is it if you
have more than one antifa
um oh wow that is a uh oh jeez
uh a nursery no a riot
no it's a diet that's good that's good
it's very good all right thanks greg
thank you glad we got it together
come and do my show soon all right we'll
do love to
all right take care bye-bye
all right that was fun go out and buy
the plus
oh i forgot to ask where books are sold
but i think you can figure that out you
got your google and all that
don't you all right
um here's a question for you on twitter
you'll find lots of people arguing about
whether president trump did a good
job or a bad job so far on the
coronavirus has he quote
botched it as i was saying earlier
botched is one of those words that's
really good
i'm going to start using botched to
criticize other things
because when you hear it just it almost
closes down a debate
it's like um well let's talk about what
he did or didn't do he botched it
okay but maybe we could dig in a little
bit see what decisions he made
compared to what could have been done he
botched it it's like
it's it's just a total conversation
stopper but
one of the questions i have is that when
people
uh give me examples of other countries
who they say did a good job tamping down
the virus early
they give these examples
indonesia south korea
and what was the other one
sanskrit taiwan and i ask you this
are those comparable and
is there anything that you notice about
the the ones that are doing well
is there any commonality of the
countries that did a good job early
or so it seems and i would say yes
oh new zealand is another one all right
so so see if you can find the pattern
new zealand south korea
taiwan and was it indonesia
what do they all have in common yeah
they're islands
or island-ish you know uh indonesia is
separated by water
but and and south korea is effectively
an island because it's only connected by
the
demilitarized zone to the rest of the
continent
so if you're a small
homogeneous population
with strong central leadership
and you don't have many states and
you're not
an international destination can we
compare that
is it fair to say that the united states
is comparable to those little small
island
different cultures may have a completely
different
a different impression about let's say
conformity
let me ask you this i wonder if i can
get canceled for this
but i'll put it out there anyway we're
talking about culture
not ethnicity so that's that i'm hoping
that keeps me from getting cancelled
culture is the south korean
culture of let's say doing what the
government asks
and other people expect is that the same
as in the united states
because in the uh united states if the
if the central government said i'm going
to sign an executive order i'm the
president
and the executive order says that all
citizens
must breathe oxygen every day
30 percent of the country would be dead
by lunch
because they'd say i'm not going to
breathe no oxygen just because my
government told me
is that the same in south korea in south
korea do they say if the government
tells me to do it i'm going to do the
opposite
that's sort of unique to the american
identity isn't it
you know if we're being honest
part of what has made america a
successful country
is that we are some
how can i say it in the kindest possible
way
we are some uh
let's say non-conformists you know
there are a whole bunch of ways you
could put a bad spin on this
but america our our greatest strength is
that we're all different
and those differences are allowed you
know we
we allow uh dissension
we allow rebellion we we idolize
people who go rogue you know so if you
have a country
that's really big it's an international
destination
it's got you know a bunch of states
governors who also have
power under our system
you're you know you can't easily just
stop all travel
uh you know on the ground because you've
got people coming in
across the borders etc
i just don't see how these are
comparable
but then somebody said wait you're
saying the islands do well what about
great britain to which i say i think
great britain
is sort of the exception that proves the
rule
so in other words great britain yeah i'm
no
international expert but is it not true
is it not true that great britain is an
international hub
but they also started out with a
different strategy from the rest of the
world so they've got two different
strategies
they started with herd immunity they
turned to let's try to control it
so i'm not sure that you could compare
that to anything
you know i think at the end of this we
might be able to say
that the herd immunity people let's say
sweden
were better or worse than the rest of
the country but you have to wait till
the end don't you
because what if we think that great
britain did the worst possible job
but we don't get a vaccine in time
to reach herd immunity as bad as that
will be
it could be that when you get to the end
of the game if you will i don't want to
call it a game because people
say stop calling it a game i'm going to
call it a game just for analogy purposes
there's nothing fun about it
but when you get to the end is it
possible that
because great britain accepted more
infections intentionally
up front that they simply front
loaded their pain and those that tried
to suppress it and suppress it
but we never get a good vaccine possibly
could it be that they've back loaded
some of their pain
so would you be just looking at the
front loaders versus the back loaders
and you really haven't compared their
strategies because you gotta wait till
the end of the game
all right if if you're rope-a-doping
versus trying to punch your way to a
victory
you just gotta wait till the end you
can't tell in the first round
likewise i would say that the people who
believe you can compare countries
just in general any any two countries i
think they're missing
a lot because
can you sort out you know all of the
variables
that compare these two countries think
about
think about the number of studies
and data that you've seen recently let's
just say the last
year just pick the last year how many
times have you seen a study
or an analysis that turned out to be
wrong
how about every day it's the most common
thing in the world
so we know that studies in general and
predictions and analyses and models
we've seen them all be wrong wrong wrong
wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
now imagine how uncomplicated a lot of
them have been
they're complicated they're all
complicated but they're relatively
uncomplicated
compared to comparing two countries
think about it
try comparing any two countries
and and it's a it's a dumb comparison in
the first place
because if you're trying to figure out
if president trump is a good leader
try this experiment here's a here's a
mental experiment
you know those countries you thought did
a good job
south korea new zealand let's take
their leader make that person the
president of the united states during
the pandemic
now how'd they do same
no not the same because leadership
might be the least important variable in
this whole damn thing
because i've got a feeling that all of
the leaders
follow the experts now the experts might
have been a little different in each
country
and also there are some countries who
had to do whatever they could do
just whatever they could do they didn't
have the same resources
imagine if you will and i'm not going to
predict this but just imagine it
imagine if you will that the countries
who didn't have great resources
said to themselves well we better try
this hydroxychloroquine thing
because we don't have you know a lot of
icy use and hospital capacity
it's a hail mary we don't know if it
works but it's cheap
let's try it so suppose all the all the
poorer countries or let's say countries
that were worried about their hospital
capacity
tried a certain medication and we don't
yet know if it worked
you think you do but i think it's pretty
unclear at this point
and what if that was the thing what if
the united states and some other
countries were just
sort of excluded from using that because
the press had
poisoned it so uh so anyway
my point is there are so many variables
in comparing a country
that it can't be done and the moment
that you think it can be done
you've you've you've fallen into a trap
it just isn't doable now if you'd like
to check that only talk to somebody
who's done this for a living
all right talk to somebody who is
actually
an expert at analyzing things and just
ask this question
you expert at analyzing things can you
really compare countries
now and if you can can you do it
halfway through the pandemic when you
know that they have different waves and
different
you know different strategies or do you
have to wait to the end
all right
on that point uh joe scarborough
of morning joe tweeted this quote from
scott gottlieb md who was the uh
obviously the past head of the fda in
the past administration
correct me if i'm wrong he wasn't he was
in an administration
prior but he said all of the studies
that are
that were rigorously done have pointed
in the same direction
talking about hydroxychloroquine so all
the studies that have been
rigorously done all of them all of the
studies
that have been rigorously done have
pointed in the same direction
that it doesn't work hydroxychloroquine
i think at this point he says
we can definitively say
hydroxychloroquine doesn't work
i'm not sure what more we need to do
to which i tweeted back it is also true
by the way what he says is completely
true
it is 100 true that all of the studies
that were rigorously done shows it
doesn't work
i think you all agree with that right
all of the studies
it is also true that all of the studies
that were rigorously done that show it
don't work
studied the wrong application of the
drug
right aren't both of those true i think
i think dr gottlieb is 100 true in his
statement
that all of the rigorous studies show it
doesn't work
but it is also true i'm adding this part
that all of the rigorous studies studied
the wrong thing
now i'm still at 50 chance
that this hydroxychloroquine is is
effective
and works because i've never seen
anything
quite like this i gotta tell you
well i probably don't have to tell you
you you've observed this if you've been
watching me for a while is it or is it
not true
that i'm generally confident
to let's say overconfident all the way
to being a jerk i'm so confident
about a lot of stuff i mean it doesn't
matter the topic
i'm usually pretty confident in my
opinion
on the hydroxyl chloroquine i don't have
anything like that and
it's really weird because i've never
seen a
situation in which i was so fascinated
at how
little that little advantage i have
either the left
it works or it doesn't work i'm right on
the fence
i can see why the people say it works or
going in that direction
i can see whether people who say it
doesn't work or saying it
and i don't know who's going to be the
winner when this when this is all done
which fascinates me
here's a uh i think cnn is trying to get
the president killed
here's a headline that they ran trump
signals he'll do anything in his power
to win
and then you read the article and do you
think the article
supports this headline no i don't even
have to tell you what's in the article
but it doesn't support this headline
but it's the top left headline on the
cnn home page
which means it's the one they want you
to see you put the top left one is
the important one and they're actually
saying
trump signals he'll do anything in his
power to win
meaning that you're breaking the law
apparently that's what they're
suggesting
but then you read the article there's
nothing there's nothing like that there
are just some things
that he's suggesting that you know like
having an extra debate
[Laughter]
does does suggesting an earlier and
extra debate
sound like doing anything in his power
to win
those sound different to me did you all
watch the sally
yates testimony that was boring and
complicated
and here's what's so diabolical about it
there are very few people in the public
and i'm certainly not one of them
uh who can listen to something like the
sally yates
interview and know what she said wrong
and know what maybe was a lie and know
what is accurate
and thankfully we have joel pollock who
has
all of the all of the qualifications to
watch that and tell us
where the lies are so you should follow
him on twitter
because he calls out the um
i guess they would be lies or at least
inaccuracies
in uh what she said compared to what we
know to be true
but that what's dangerous about the all
this stuff
is that it feels like the biggest thing
in the world right
that there was a a coup against a
legally elected president
and that the you know members of the fbi
et cetera
were in on this coup and and now it's
been uncovered and we know it's a cue
and half of the country is acting like
it didn't happen
is this weird and we've come into this
world where
you could just act like something didn't
happen
and i feel like at this point the uh
you know they always they always say
that trump could choose somebody on
fifth avenue and they'd
still be supported but in a different
way
uh i think joe biden could actually
die on camera and
and the people the the democrats would
say
he's fine and it would turn into this
monty python sketch about the dead
parrot
and it would look exactly like that and
we would just be
we don't what are we watching because we
watched him die
on camera he's lying there he's dead
and cnn would report no he isn't
no he isn't and their viewers would
would be cnn and they would say
oh he's still alive and they wouldn't
see the clip of him dying
and they would never read fox news and
they would literally
vote for a dead guy because they didn't
believe he was dead
i think we've reached the point where he
could actually die
on camera and cnn could just say that
didn't happen
sounds like a right-wing conspiracy to
me he took a nap
sure he took a nap everybody takes a nap
oh you haven't taken a nap
no he's permanently dead
sounds like a conspiracy it's a crazy
world
all right um so
one of the big issues is censorship so
not only
has twitter removed twitter removed
something
because they say it was not medically
accurate
in terms of coven 19. so was the
president's
campaign twitter account
coincidentally the communications
director for twitter
he happens to be kamala harris's former
press secretary
now i don't think he makes these
decisions he's
a communications director not a decision
maker of who gets
banned or not but uh
are you comfortable with the
communications director for twitter
being komba harris's former press
secretary
that should make you a little bit
uncomfortable
but yet but yet if i can if i can give
both sides of
the story there probably aren't that
many people
who are world-class communications
directors
so you know you can't you can't say you
shouldn't have a job
in private industry just because he was
good at some other job
so i i don't uh i would not support
any restrictions on who could have any
job just because of what job they had in
the past that would be inconsistent with
anything i believe
but it's useful to know useful to know
the connections
and here's what's interesting about it
though
the original tweet violated twitter's
rules
for misinformation and i think what he
said was what trump said that got him in
trouble was
quote the kids are quote almost immune
to covet 19.
now it would not be true
that kids have an immunity to it it
would be true
that when they get it it doesn't have
that big of an impact
on them now because trump is not
a medical doctor and as soon as he said
almost immune i believe he clarified
what he meant
to mean that it doesn't affect them as
much when they get it
that's what i heard but maybe i'm wrong
on that so here's the question
at what point does twitter become your
doctor
and they get to decide what is accurate
medical information
in a world in which experts disagree
now if experts did not disagree
i'd say yeah if they're on the same side
and twitter sees somebody saying
something the experts disagree with why
not
you know you might want to flag it it'd
be better just to flag it and say the
experts
disagree but almost immune is really
just a choice of words
that one feels to me like something that
a clarification
banner should have been better in other
words here's how i would have handled
this
if i were twitter if i were twitter i
would
pin a uh like a an alpha comment
so that if you saw the story you'd see
very highlighted you couldn't miss it
whatsoever
the twitter clarification and the
clarification would be
in this context almost immune refers to
the fact that they
tend not to have medical complications
when they contract it
and i would think that would be fair i
don't think the president would even
argue with that right
because if you clarify what the
president's saying
you're saying what he's saying which
also is compatible with
with science why would he disagree with
that so
shutting it down until that tweet is
deleted feels like
feels a little political when it would
be easier to handle it as
information that needs to be clarified
and then facebook also took down
something
what did facebook take down facebook
took down something for being
uh inaccurate to which i say
how does anybody know what's accurate
anymore
we have so left behind the world where
anybody knows
anything is accurate i mean any data
any study any expert consensus
there isn't any of it that's reliable
anymore we
we've so left behind the world where
you could just know what's true all
right
uh did you all see joe biden's uh
campaign ad in which he
gets into an old mustang i guess he
drives up and down his own driveway i
think
i don't know if that's his driveway but
it looks like some protected area there
um there were various reactions to it
i saw mike cernovich say that it was an
impressive ad
i don't know what words he used but but
he thought it was a good ad
and i had the opposite response
because when i watched joe biden drive a
car by himself
what thought do you have because the
thought that i automatically have is
we should take his car keys away
yeah because he only drove like
literally in this protected
no other car area it looked like
somebody's driveway but it was
at the very least it was an enclosed
area so it's not like he was in traffic
and i really have to
um well let me ask you this
oh i'm sorry it was a corvette i was an
old corvette yeah you're right
uh it was not a mustang it was an old
corvette it was a pretty cool car
i liked the car um but did any of you
have the same feeling i did
which is it's a question of taking his
keys away
because i couldn't not think that the
whole time he was in the car i thought
take his keys away take his keys away
weren't you thinking that so i
uh so i don't see that that worked the
way they wanted it to but
it's hard to know um
jake novak is a great source if you're
not following
jake novak on twitter you should
because the explosions that you're
seeing in beirut
and now there's some more fires in iran
and
i think in iraq had some big fires
recently
there may be a pattern here if you know
what i mean and the pattern
as jake novak writes
might be that we know where iran is
keeping their
secret terrorist weapons it looks like
that
because what it looks like is that
somebody
could be who knows could be israel
could be somebody else but it looks like
somebody
knows where iran is keeping their bad
stuff
and the bad stuff is going up in flames
so there
there must be something different
happening in iran
compared to however long ago that we
seem to know where their stuff is
so there could be an insider who has
turned that's speculation
and if that's the case and maybe because
iran is already degraded their economy
is in bad shape because the sanctions
and coronavirus that maybe iran is in
such a weakened position right now
that if we if we meaning israel the
united states
knows where all the uh hezbollah
stocks of weapons are etc maybe they're
just rolling them all up
and just saying well by the end of the
week they're not going to have any more
weapons depots
so it looks like that's what's happening
but it's hard to know
there was a raid at jake paul's house
everybody's watching that
i don't know what to make of that so
there's going to be some
crime that we haven't heard of that i
think he will be
alleged to have committed there are some
reports about taxes
they wouldn't rate his house for that
there's
pictures of them taking away weapons i
don't think they would have raided his
house
just for that so i think i feel like
there's more to this story
we'll figure it out later um
and let's see if i've covered all of my
fascinating points
so biden's not going to go to wisconsin
to accept the nomination he i don't know
where he'll be in his basement
uh the president has said maybe he'll do
his
uh thing from the white house and then
of course people will complain because
he's at the white house
i think he'll probably have to back at
back down from using the white house
just because you don't
you don't use the white house for
campaigning
but i would love to see that also use
the drive-in theater
concept meaning that people all over the
country
this is not my idea i've talked about
this before could just go to a
drive-in and you know watch the show
from the drive-in
at least they're with other with other
people who want to watch it at the same
time
let's talk about these cheaper faster
tests
apparently there are a number of
companies developing cheap tests
that are you know just a few bucks and
will give you a result
in minutes as opposed to waiting days
you can do it yourself you don't even
have to ask anybody
else you just have your own little test
kit like a home pregnancy kit
nobody knows if you're pregnant if you
do a home pregnancy kit
right you're the only one who knows
likewise these tests
you'd be the only one who knows unless
you want somebody to tell you
now the exception would be if you're
being tested by your
court your company or something then
they would know but of course they need
to know
and so the uh
the question is this what needs to be
changed
um so that these can work and it looks
like there are two changes
that i understand these are these are
from david boxenhorn
who's uh who pointed me to a video by
michael mina
who's an expert in this field and it
looks like that the only thing stopping
these
cheap tests which by the way the
difference between the cheap ones and
the expensive ones
is that the expensive ones uh are really
good at detecting
a lot of stuff that's too late the cheap
ones
are not as sensitive so they might miss
somebody who just got the virus and they
don't have much of a viral load
but because they're fast and cheap and
you can use them
anywhere you want your odds of finding
somebody
when it matters are way higher
so if you hear less sensitive tests
and your mind has translated that into
less
useful it's the reverse it's the fact
that you can do it cheap and quickly
and it gets most it gets most of the big
ones
not every everyone that is the thing
that can change the
nature of the the curve because if
you've got enough people testing
you get all the big ones the obvious
ones you cut the rate of transmission
enough that probably gets it under
control so there seem to be
two as i understand it and by the way
uh at this point i'm still in the
learning phase so you should take
everything i say in this topic
as a little bit of well let's you know
get some confirmation about this
i want to make sure so i wouldn't give a
hundred percent
certainty to anything i say on this
topic or any other really
but there seem to be two changes uh one
uh and let's call these over-the-counter
tests because that's a better phrase
it's easier to conceptualize that these
cheap tests would be over the counter
versus clinical setting medical setting
and the sensitivity requirements for
these tests
are the same as the diagnostic tests so
right now the fda
has the same requirement for how
how accurate they are what i shouldn't
say accurate how sensitive they are and
they're comparing these cheap
over-the-counter type tests
to the ones that you do in more of a
clinical medical setting
and it's just the wrong standard in this
situation
now in a normal situation why would the
fda ever approve anything
that is less good at detecting
than whatever whatever we know we could
get to under normal conditions
this would be a perfectly good standard
from the fdi
fda this is not a normal situation
this is a situation where being fast and
sloppy
gets it done better fast and sloppy
now sloppy just means a little less
sensitive but
fast and sloppy over the counter solves
a pandemic
this is not like any other situation and
and the fda needs to be looking at that
rule
for an exception i don't know if there's
an executive order that can change that
that may not be a thing but if there is
that's what i'd be looking at
and the other requirement that the fda
has so there are
two things that need to change in order
for these cheap over-the-counter tests
to be a
big tool the others the fda requires
reporting of test results now i don't
know the details of that
but who in the world is going to buy an
over-the-counter cheap test
and then do what report on it
you know who's who's reporting
so why would he why would he even need a
reporting requirement
it doesn't even make any sense for this
particular application
so there are two fda rules that i think
probably make perfect sense for most
situations
it's just that it doesn't make sense for
this one
and this is what you need a president
trump for
now again i'm not 100 sure that i know
this topic well enough but i'm 100 sure
that if we haven't exhausted this that
we're probably
you know not doing everything we can to
find out what we can do
so we should at the very least exhaust
this topic and find out if it's real if
it can make a difference
if indeed just these two little tweaks
to the fda
for just a special case could be a thing
i think that needs to be very close to
the top of the task force's
priorities all right
i believe that is just about what i
wanted to talk about today
and i thank you for tuning in and i will
see you
tomorrow
