coming to you early like I normally do
for the local subscribers but I've got a
big internet problem today and I can't
run multiple screens so today I'm on
uh using the uh Rumble Studio to come
into four different platforms so I'm
coming into
locals
Rumble um X and YouTube at the same time
now I've never done this and the
comments are going to be about 16
seconds delayed and this will be the
first time we've mixed the locals
comments with the other
comments um but this might be a preview
of things to come so this is not the
show this is the pre-show which normally
only the local subscribers see but if
you'd like to see what happens five
minutes before the actual show I came to
the right place because usually all I'm
doing is adjusting my lighting and
printing my notes so if you want to hang
out and chat with each other while I do
that that's what this is for uh I'm not
going to do anything
provocative because this is all the
platforms if this were just the
subscribers and locals you might get
some extra stuff today but we'll keep it
generic make everybody
happy now on this platform um unless
this
is see unless there's an option which I
don't see uh I only see your oldest
comments
first so your new scroll to the
bottom oh it looks like they fixed that
I'll be
downn that they may have fixed the
comment scroll since just two days ago
when I mentioned it well that's pretty
fast uh if you
haven't let my people go I won't have
time to check that
yeah don't expect that I'm going to be
able to check any links that you send me
during the chat
that's yeah no no I was wrong the chat's
broken or maybe oh maybe if I keep my
cursor
oh I just found out a interesting bug I
think I think if I float my cursor over
the comments oh no that's not it it
looks like there's some um sometimes
they scroll and sometimes they just
don't so it looks like a
bug all
right so the real show starts uh at the
top of the
hour this is a special behind the
scenes look at the
pre-show where I adjust my
lighting right now I'm coming to you by
5G on my
phone which suggests I should probably
plug it
in
[Music]
yeah I've got at least an hour on the
phone that should be
fine all right let me turn off the
alert all right we're in good shape we
got a strong 5G signal which is very
rare do any of you have this issue where
when you're regular internet goes
out your um phone 5G goes out at the
same time am might the only person who
experiences that on a regular
basis can't tell because I can't see any
comments oh I remember when comments
were something that was
useful so the rumble people have a
challenge which is to fix the comments
otherwise my business model falls apart
because the the live interaction is
really the heart of the
show which we don't have in this
model
so in order for me to see a comment I
have to physically reach up and scroll
it every
time so I I can't do the thing anymore
where I'm just doing the show then I see
a comment and I you know incorporate
that it just won't work in this model so
the technology isn't where we need it to
be but uh bubles working on it they have
they have all my
feedback and they've been very
responsive in the past so I do expect
them to take a good swing at fixing it I
just don't know if it's technically
possible can I see locals comments uh
yeah I can see Crawley I can see you
asking the question um and they are
they're they show up
differently let's see if I can show you
what it looks
like see if this works
let's see reverse
this and
then can you God this is annoying that
everything's
backwards why can't I do
that right everything's like backwards
twice
so oh why can't I do this this is weird
I have to hold it up to the opposite of
where it is where I
it
okay oh this is so
hard like you have to think backwards
twice or something in order to line this
up anyway so you see that the comments
do not scroll which makes them worthless
to me I don't know if they scroll where
you are but I can see each of them with
an icon that says it's coming from
locals so I can say em and Dean and
thirston and Crawley and upy boy but on
Rumble I can see
roie those the only comments I think we
may
be not live anywhere but
locals and Rumble oh actually I
don't it looks like I don't have any
comments I can't even tell if I'm
actually I can't tell if I'm live to the
other
platforms oh there it
is there we
go yeah so there are I see the YouTube
comments oh look there's
next I see next comment too from Kim all
right looks like all the comments are
here it's working on
Rumble good deal how's our
timing oh it's after 1:00 we after the
top of the hour well you're going to
watch me printting my
notes I know that's
exciting but but you're going to
see how this show is actually
produced soon as those notes are done
we're going to put on the show of shows
5G style I got two strong bars of 5G and
so far we're streaming
good you've got a pop out chat on Rumble
that's
nice I'm live all right let me grab my
notes
let's do this right shall
[Music]
we good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
that's called coffee with scottt Adams
don't know what's going to happen today
we're using the rumble platform for all
four platforms uh YouTube and Rumble and
xplatform and local subscribers my
special favorites and if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
nobody can even understand hey Paul all
you need is a CER muger glass of tanker
CH a canteen sugar flask a vessel of any
and fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee hadn't joined me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dop me of the
day thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous siping it
happens right
now oh that was
good sometimes I have to pretend the
coffee tastes delicious but today
absolutely
delicious all right look at all those
comments um it's not frozen on my side
everything's looking good here
oh comments are scrolling too look at
that look at that all working
good or working well as you'd like to
say all right yes uh we're not locals is
not getting rid of comments they we'll
just move to the rumble studio so your
comments will all be here and then uh
they're working on the technology to get
them to be a little faster if that's
possible might not be possible but I
think there's a 68c delay on the C
anyway let's jump right into it the fake
science I like to start with fake
science NBC news reports there a study
that says you might be able to slow your
biological aging by eating
less how many times have you heard this
story I feel like this is the millionth
study that showed us maybe for the last
30 years 40 years haven't we been
hearing the same study just repeated
every year for 40 years I'm not alone in
that
right uh but here's what's left out and
why I consider this fake science fake
science it's because the thing that they
say they're measuring is that you eat
fewer
calories so they have a control group
that eats what they want I guess and
another group that has limited calories
and then they measure their biomarkers
and they find out that the people who
ate less food
have better biomarkers now there's an
obvious point to this which is obesity
is not good for you but if you're doing
a short-term study it seems weird that
you know that that you'd see a big
difference in the short term but here's
what's left
out I'm pretty sure that our food supply
is largely
poison meaning that the more food you
eat it's not just more calories it's
more poison
it's more additives it's more pesticides
it's more everything so they did a they
did a test to see if eating fewer
calories made you healthy healthier but
they never tested to see if eating less
poison makes you uh healthier don't you
think if you were eating at McDonald's
and you just did less of it it's not
just the calories that you got less of
you got less of all the stuff you didn't
want in your body of course it makes you
healthier of course it does so that's a
weird science and that there's not even
a mention to the fact that the food
itself might be bad for
you all right here's more of fake
science I guess the uh Biden
Administration is trying to come up with
a new climate forecast model that would
take into account what they want to do
in terms of uh um reducing a
aircraft contribution to CO2 so they're
trying to figure out how to model just
what would be different if they get a
Greener type of um jet
fuel so here's something that's embedded
in the
story that if you didn't notice it you
wouldn't know that it debunked all
models So within the story saying how
they're going to create a model is a
paragraph that debunks all models they
don't cow it out that way you just have
to notice it all right here's that
paragraph um it says the rumor has it
that those involved with the modeling
process can't find Common Ground
regarding the actual impact of corn
usage in the
synthesis some believe that it should be
weighted with a higher penalty since
carbon generation occurs during the
harvesting
phase the ethanol industry wants to to
see as carbon impact as low as possible
in order to blah blah blah all right did
you did you catch
it yeah in that was the debunking of all
climate models how many of you how many
of you saw
it all right here's what you should
say the climate models are completely
dependent on the
assumptions the model is not even
important the Assumption they make about
how important it is to let's say just
using their example um to consider or
not consider I don't know the Time of
the Season when you're picking the corn
or something like that so so you could
simply make an assumption that would
completely change the outcome now is
this a special case is this the one time
somebody built a projection model in
which the assumptions really drove the
output no it's the only way it can be
there's no other way it can be in the
real world world the assumptions that
the PE the study people put into it
determines the output that's the
opposite of
science it's the
opposite you can't be more opposite than
the people sitting in a room debating
what assumption should be in your model
that's the that's the least scientific
thing anybody ever did
ever but we still we still have this
little fiction like the models can
predict predict the
future nope never have never
will um there's a company that I still
have a subscription to called iock where
you get stock photos that you could use
you know with a a license approval and
every now and then I'll use one of those
for my posting on social media so I
wanted to look for a picture of a
 because I was going to do a post
in which a dumb person you know would be
a good picture for it so I went there
and I searched within iock and this is a
Getty Getty company they own it um and I
looked for
 um do you think there were any
issues
with the
diversity the way they handled the
diversity so it was a page of
morons and uh but they weren't all the
same now I hope this doesn't kick me off
here but
uh let me show you some uh some of the
pictures see if this
works um first of all it was almost all
white people but there was one black
person on the page and you think to
yourself how'd they handle
that you how are they going to have
diversity in a uh
result it's going to be pretty hard but
here's how they handled
it uh there were a bunch of white people
shown and I think a few Asians and
here's a white
person here he is you know drinking has
crazy eyes and he's got weird teeth and
everything he's like ah not doing too
well now this was typical there were
lots of white people looking like morons
but then here's the here's the sensitive
part they also have a picture of a black
man that comes up in the search
now how do how do you think they handle
that so here's here's their image of a
black
 which is funny because he looks
more like a scientist or a
lawyer he's got a smart expression well
dressed the the difference is is
hilarious I mean this if I had to guess
I would say almost certainly college
educated looks like he's doing pretty
well goodlook smart looking guy Smart
Eyes smart
face all right well just pointing that
out um I don't think I stock images is
going to last more than a year because
AI should pretty pretty much put them
out of business and maybe it
should there's a a school district in
Aurora the state where Aurora is I don't
know where's
Aurora some somewhere in the middle west
somewhere Aurora anyway somewhere in the
United States um the superintendent says
uh that you may
not uh this is actually in a document uh
you may not implement or adopt any
program that does not prioritize
diversity equity and inclusion now what
does prioritize mean in your in your
worldview
doesn't oh Colorado so Aurora Colorado
thank you so what does it mean to
prioritize
Dei wouldn't that mean that you sort of
had to put it in front of oh I don't
know everything that's what it means
right if you prioritize it you push it
above other
considerations what would be the other
considerations good ideas things that
work things that are good for the
world as soon as you throw in
prioritize it's just
racist there's no other way to look at
it there there's no second way to look
at this if you say if you say in writing
it's our policy to prioritize it there
isn't any way to prioritize it unless
you give up other
things so what are you giving up they
should tell us what they're
deemphasizing
what what are you giving
up all
right
uh so as I told you our food supply is
very dangerous but getting more
dangerous every day apparently there was
a a food airdrop in Gaza in which one of
the parachutes didn't open and five
people were killed by Falling
food big pallet of food now I don't know
how you get five people with one pallet
of
food that's like the worst luck I've
ever seen in my life not only as Glen
Greenwald points out not only did these
poor people survive the bombing and the
famine and God knows what disease and
deprivation they're going through and
then they get killed with a pallet of
food
now that's just about the worst thing
I've ever
heard but but it certainly gives you
this weird feeling that if your time has
come your time has come you ever you
ever feel that this is like the reverse
of that joke you know you know the old
joke I tell too many times about the
flood and you know God says I sent you a
car I sent you a boat I sent you a
helicopter you know you just didn't take
them but it's like the the Bad Evil
backwards version of that it's like you
know God I tried to kill you with the
bombs I tried to kill you with the
starvation and none of that worked so
I'm just to drop a pal of food right on
your heads and kill you all so yes it's
just the worst thing I've ever heard in
my life in terms of bad luck
geez so I I do believe that you can hold
two thoughts in your head which is that
what's happening over there is horrific
on a scale that we hope we would never
see again in in modern society
at the same
time what else you going to do somebody
had a better idea I'm sure they would
have suggested
it
um there's a study that says that uh a
lot of Americans can't buy cars so you
need an annual income of $100,000 to
purchase a car I assume that means a new
car so on average if you don't make
$100,000 can't get a car but most uh the
average American household is closer to
8,000 so buying a
car in today's world pretty hard um what
they don't say is that even if you have
money you can't buy a
car it's almost impossible to buy a car
has anybody tried to buy a car I won't I
won't bore you with my whole
story but let me tell you my there's a
quick version of buying a Toyota truck
so I wanted to get a Tacoma so I got to
the Toyota dealer I look around I think
oh they must have closed this dealership
there's no trucks no Toyotas but I go
inside because they're actually open and
it turns out they don't have almost any
inventory and the reason they don't have
any inventory is that it gets purchased
before it arrives at the lot they can't
make them fast
enough so here's so if you want to buy a
truck you could buy one that's in the
pipeline but the pipeline ones are all
random combinations of features and
colors that are very unlikely to be what
you want but if you're lucky and you can
get one in the pipeline before all the
other people who were also looking at
the same pipeline before they grab it
well then and only then you can have a
Toyota
truck literally you can't buy one so I
so I tell the the salesperson well if
you get a truck that meets you know
these criteria which weren't that
restrictive you know give me a call and
I'll come right down and buy it no
call say when I tried to buy a a Ford
truck a while ago um you know they
didn't have any I could drive and I've
never owned a truck I've driven them but
I've never owned a truck and I thought
I'm not going to buy a truck I can't
even drive one that's in the same
general idea so I couldn't buy a truck
and I couldn't buy a a Ford I couldn't
buy a
Toyota
and so there we are
anyway I can see why um and then I
thought about the process of negotiating
for a car and I thought I would almost
rather do anything than spend a whole
day
negotiating has anybody brought their
laptop to a a car
purchase because remember they used to
use the trick where they'd say I'll talk
to my boss and they be gone for an hour
and what they're really trying to do is
make you stay there as long as possible
so you're too invested in the process to
ever say no that that's why they do it
so they're trying to wear you down
physically they're trying to physically
exhaust you so has anybody brought their
laptop and say hey take your time I got
a lot of work to do and then just start
happily doing your work on your laptop
while they while they they think they're
sweating you out but you're actually
getting a lot of work done hey I think
I'll send some posts if you haven't done
that yet you need to do
it because it ruins their whole game
because you know they're they're back
there peeking out to see if you're still
there so they can run out in case you
leave they'll they'll run out and grab
you and bring you back so you know
they're watching so just make it look
like you're really having a good time on
your
laptop getting a lot of work done anyway
there's a uh oh we we hear that uh the
xplatform is going to compete with
YouTube so they're going to have a big
video platform that it'll play on some
smart TVs that's the big announcement
and it will look very much like the
YouTube uh interface so musk is going
big for a video which is the Smart
play there's a little garage
startup who was made a what would be an
$88,000 robot and it it's they print the
parts and they put little Motors in it
who's it called I think it's a k scale
labs and the funny part is that the the
founder of this little garage
startup uh as soon as I saw him talking
I said my God that's Elon mus too he
looks like Elon Musk he looks like him
and talks like him and then I looked in
the comments and somebody else said the
same thing I oh good I'm not imagining
it so yeah there's somebody who reminds
you of Elon Musk who just made an $8,000
robot that you could just have running
around your house now I'm assuming you
just load it with I know one of their
AIS
um but here's what I would like to
suggest if somebody could tell me who
makes the best little motors for robots
because each of the you know the arms
and legs of the robot are going to have
a number of motors and servos or
whatever they're called to activate all
the
body shouldn't we be investing in Little
Motors that go into robots is there a
company that owns that like in owns the
gips for
AI do doesn't it seem like that's the
the shovel investment for the the gold
rush because the robots are going to use
a lot of little
Motors
