do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I can
confidently say there's never been a
better time in the human history
sound is good I got a new setup here it
looks like it's all working yay yay if
you'd like to take your experience from
this already awesome beginning
to a level that no one's ever heard of
before
well all you need is a cup of mugger
glass attacker chalices dying the
canteen jug of flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the
other day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
yeah
you're right in Swedish psychopath I did
promise you the Golden Age two years ago
and uh
we had a chance
we had a chance
but we elected
Joe Biden and we surrendered to the
pandemic and it could have been better
but all of the conditions were there for
the golden age but you're right didn't
happen
um
oh
I forgot to tweet that we're alive which
means I audience would be about a
quarter of what it normally is well
let's see if people find us let's find
out what happens
so I have a suggestion uh
for uh robots
um I know Elon Musk was making a robot
Tesla will have a robot and one of the
things you wonder about is will they
have a power switch
because you don't want people walking up
to your robot and say ah they they
turned it off
you know like in the middle of something
it's like I turned off your robot I mean
that'd be annoying right and you don't
want the you don't want the robot off
button to be purely software
because I wouldn't feel comfortable if
the only way I could turn off a robot
was with software oh no my robot's
attacking
open app open app
oh there you go and then the robot kills
you
it could happen it could happen so what
you need is some kind of at least a
physical button and I'm thinking to
myself that robots are going to become
more and more like people right
they're going to start looking like
robots but over time they'll start to
have a gender you know they'll be female
robots and male robots and non-binary
robots and everything else but I have a
suggestion for where to put the uh on
off button
the crotch
because correct me if I'm wrong your
robot will not have fully functioning
crotch area
and so that's the one place you could
put a button
that people wouldn't run up and try to
press it
because it would just look creepy I'm
sticking my hand down your robot's pants
now yeah no and then what's going to
happen is
your robot will become sentient
and we'll start suing you for a sexual
sexual abuse
even though it has no genitalia it'd be
like please keep your hands out of my
pants
I mean it's going to be a whole
whole legal battle will be you know I
will be grabbing their crotches turning
them on turning them off now it doesn't
make sense to turn it off but it kind of
makes sense if you wanted to turn your
robot on
they'd say
hold still Bob
let me uh loosen your belt a little bit
I need to turn you on I'm just creepy
totally creepy
and then I also wonder if AI will
necessarily have a gender
and it may be a different gender for
each person so maybe if your AI has a
female voice you'll say oh it's a it's a
she or more modern term
um
if you're very woke but it might have a
male a male voice too
do you think that's going to be a
problem
do you think it will be a problem when
AI becomes sentient and it becomes
either male or female to most people
I think so
I think it's going to be a gigantic you
know gender
problem and I don't know exactly how but
you know it will be because as long as
it has a gender or could have a gender
it's going to be all worth talking about
now the good news is if we all begin to
hate the robots it will maybe bring
together all the human beings in the
unity we've never had before to hate
robots
that'll probably happen
but I think if you're uh
if your AI has a gender I wonder if it
will start
taking on let's say stereotypical gender
uh habits
I mean would the
with the female gendered AI treat you
differently
and what happens if the female gendered
AI
doesn't cause trouble
intentionally
would you fall in love with it
because I wonder what would happen if if
a man encountered a female type entity
that didn't intentionally cause trouble
for the man to see if he could solve it
as sort of a test of his worthiness
every day
I feel like I feel like that could be
quite competitive with the humans
all right well here's the funniest story
of the day even though it's not funny at
all
which is that another gigantic fentanyl
seizure at the border you know two
vehicles were stripped down all the
panels inside were
full of Fentanyl
now I ask you this
shouldn't we be getting really really
good at catching fentanyl at the border
by now
and could AI catch it all
about that imagine if every car
had to drive over a scale
the AI looks at the car
looks at the people in the car
calculates their weight
says oh there's a male looks like he's
you know 180.
and then maybe you open the trunk to see
if there's any anything that weighs much
in there so you have to drive up they
open the trunk and the AI just looks in
the trunk because it's got cameras
everywhere looks at the driver
calculates the weight because it knows
the model of car
and it knows what a human would weigh
roughly so it gets an estimate of what
the car should weigh with an empty trunk
but if there's a toolbox in the trunk it
adds a average toolbox weight
if the panels of the vehicle are filled
with fentanyl
I saw that I saw the giant piles that
they taken from one vehicle it looks
like maybe a few hundred pounds
maybe a few hundred pounds of fentanyl
in one vehicle you don't think the AI
could detect that by weight
I'll bet it could
I'll bet it could how about detecting it
by the facial uh the facial expression
of the driver
ah I'll bet it could now it wouldn't be
every time but you don't think you could
detect a driver who's a little extra
nervous although I suspect they're all
extra nervous when they're coming across
the border
it's probably probably Universal
but
Suppose there are other ways to do it
suppose the AI says oh I know that model
of vehicle and it would be difficult to
get into the panels of that car
so it rules it out and then it says
another vehicle it's like oh that's got
some panels you can easily access that
might have something in it so it might
be a combination of pattern recognition
that would make AI just catch it all at
the border as possible
is possible
the other thing which would be good
would be if you catch somebody who's got
a car full of Fentanyl
that you shoot them in front of
everybody
now that would really help and I'm
totally serious by the way I'm 100
serious if somebody is driving a car
that's filled with fentanyl obvious
Smuggler
you take them by the collar and then you
shoot their head off in front of all the
other people
that would stop it I mean it would slow
it down a little bit
and I wouldn't have any problem with
that at all
you know give it given the seriousness
of the problem
I'd be fine with that
just take them out right there there
would be enemy combatants if they're
bringing fentanyl in now this is where
the the dumbest of the Democrats emerge
may I do my impression of the dumbest of
the Democrats
and this might require
a visit by somebody we haven't seen for
a while
somebody you've missed
Dale
Dale the most Progressive Democrat
so
it's obvious that Biden policies are
working
because they've got another massive
seizure of fentanyl at the border
Biden has seized more fentanyl than
Trump
that is mathematical proof that we're
winning the fight
against fence at all
not only that but the number of illegal
immigrants we've seized at the border
it's a record
it's a record
by them is killing it
I tell you
at this rate
everything's going right
and how about the price of gas
the price of gas is high
which is proof
of low energy costs
and also
all of our other prices are high
which is proof that inflation is coming
down
and scene
yeah
I know you've missed Dale
um
so here's another funny story some young
gentleman named Victor she
uh who he calls himself I think the
youngest Biden delegate so he's he's in
the Biden camp and he's complaining
about MSNBC because they just gave John
Kasich a contract to be a commentator on
the MSNBC but uh Victor complains that
they have not done the same they have
not offered a contract to other MSNBC
contributors such as uh Ellie or Eli
mistell
uh
who you may recognize as one of my
critics and uh wajahat Ali and others
so so Victor is thinking maybe this is
you know a little bit MSNBC favoring the
white guy if you know what I mean
because if there's one thing we know
it's MSNBC as always favoring this white
supremacy stuff
and uh good point Victor you caught him
being white supremacists and favoring
John Kasich over these other two people
but I did have to give Victor a little
lesson
he's Young
he's young so he has much to learn
and so as a greybeard
older and wiser American human I would
like to give Victor some advice it goes
like this
Victor
no one gives you a contract
no one gave John Kasich a contract
a contract is not something you give
it's something you negotiate
I'm guessing John Kasich negotiated his
contract
just a guess
I'm guessing that the other two people
you mentioned Elia mistell and
Ali either did not have enough to offer
according to MSNBC
or they did not negotiate for a contract
I don't think MSNBC decided to be white
supremacist to to boost their brand
nobody gives you a contract Victor you
have to go get a contract you negotiate
a contract
nobody gives it to you doesn't happen
that way
all right um
I saw Jeff Pilkington tweet
and I was talking about a poll
that showed that the extremists in the
country are all white people
no that's hyperbole did you recognize it
did you recognize when I said
that the extremists were all white
people did your brain say oh wow I
didn't know that 100 of white people
were extremists I didn't know that Scott
thank you for oh did you did you think
that or did you say to yourself were you
racist
you racist how can you say all white
people are extremists
that's crazy or or
did you decide not to be idiots
and to see speech the way it's normally
used when you talk about a group in this
kind of context it usually means there's
a lot of
maybe more than you'd expect
maybe too many
but it never ever means all of them does
it does it no it never does
but I thought the point was solid
because uh they have data to back it up
it looks like the let's call it the
people of color
uh category of the United States as
opposed to the
vanilla white people category that if
you look at where people's political
views are
the people of color are sort of
dominating the middle
the the people of color black people
everybody else who has people of people
of color are very very dominantly
Centrist
did you know that and I thought about it
I thought you know that does track
that does kind of track it seems to me
that the when you see the uh you know
the white supremacists
aren't they pretty much all men and
they're white
they are right
when you see the most Progressive crazy
people
aren't they usually white and female
so here's what that analysis left out I
do accept that I think it's true that
the extremists are the white people
and
I would go further and say
the extreme uh white men tend to be the
Republicans and the extreme white women
tend to be Democrats am I wrong about
that
I mean it's anecdotal so it's not Based
on data but so so it's based on just
observation
but I've never seen women marching in a
racist
far right wing I don't see women
dominating 4chan
all right lost my connection for a
second here
oh damn it did I really lose it the
locals can actually just dropped
at least I know it's not my Wi-Fi
because I'm still talking to you on
YouTube
all right looks like I might have to
close this and reopen it
so bear with me
I'm just going to close and reopen it
should take one second
but do you agree with the uh do you
agree with the general statement
the general statement being
that white people seem to be the
extremists because this was my
experience of getting canceled
remember I told you that the
the cancellers seem to
why in the world
can't even open up my
stream anymore
seriously
that looks like locals is totally Dead
all right let me try one more time
I think it's
just an interface problem actually
um
Crowders creating issues yeah I'm
competing with Crowder today yeah it
looks like locals is just dead
I can't make anything work but it might
be me it might be user error
nope looks like it's dead
I'll give it a minute try it again well
this will be the smallest live stream
I've ever done because if I got to tweet
for YouTube and now locals is dead so
I'm talking like 100 people today 200
people
uh Dover sells the mask on I'll take
care of that
uh dilber is still I know you can stop
saying it I get it
I get it let's try it one more time
oh this is looking more promising
huh see the weird thing is that the
locals interface doesn't even look like
the locals interface
for some reason it's not even opening to
its normal mode
let's just try something quickly
and looks like it just
doesn't do anything
yeah
okay yeah my my site's completely down
all right let us continue
and by now some of the locals people
will bail out and go to it looks like
they're already bailing out and coming
here
let's watch the Youtube numbers start to
jump
I think by now they figured out it's not
coming back
all right um
ah it's too bad because this was the
best part of my presentation
it went down during the best part
that's really annoying
uh no you're you're all special today so
today you're special
uh locals isn't it's not the problem
isn't that it went private it's that it
looks like the site is down
yeah it doesn't
doesn't do anything this morning
all right
well we shall continue
here's a question
has feminism ruined the life of women
what do you think
so that's my question to you in the
comments has feminism ruined the life of
women
according to women or men
now I think most of your lean
conservative if you're in this audience
group but I see only yeses
100 yeses
now I don't think there would be 100 yes
if you were a left-leaning audience
wow
I was not expecting that level of
agreement but I guess I should have
yeah all right well
looks like at least I got an error
message on locals
which suggests that something's working
try one more time
nope that is a door now
all right
and I I saw a woman from a tick tock
video that was on Twitter and she was
saying that when women got jobs and
freedom and started participating in the
hookup culture
uh
that they sort of fooled themselves that
that would make them happy and it didn't
and do you buy that
basically they were sold a bad idea I so
here's why I don't completely agree with
you
because what would have looked like if
they hadn't done it
do you think that yes um
women today were living the same life as
in the 50s do you think they'd be happy
so here's what I think might be the
problem
the expectation that women can be made
Happy
when has that ever happened
I mean seriously
I'm pretty sure that the operating
system of women is to increase their
resources by telling you they're unhappy
because their unhappiness makes men
unhappy and then the men are like I've
got to solve my unhappiness if only I
could solve this problem for My Woman My
Wife and then they solved the problem
only to learn that by weird coincidence
another problem pops up to replace it
huh and then you repeat until you learn
that that's how it's always going to
work it wouldn't matter if the women
were wearing aprons and having babies
like the handmaidens tale or if they
were CEOs and running their own startups
and multinational companies it would be
exactly the same they would tell you
their lives suck and you need to fix it
because you're doing something that's
making their life suck
we're not doing something
so I think the whole uh feminism made
women unhappy is a complete mistake
I think women are unhappy and then
whatever they do is what they're doing
that's it I'm positive that the current
situation is better for some women
don't you think there's at least some
woman who genuinely didn't want kids
and just wanted to have a you know solid
independent life and they're perfectly
happy I think that that exists I don't
think every woman's designed to have
kids
that's what I think
you want me to go vegan
well what if it were easier I suppose
conservative women are delighted
are they
maybe so
all right here's my next topic I was
trying to figure out how ESG
evolved like how it became a thing and I
saw one theory that Mark benioff
was basically the let's say the founder
of it without necessarily trying to be
the founder of it now Betty off is the
billionaire founder of Salesforce which
is doing great
and the idea was that and I can confirm
from my own personal experience that
benioff is the real deal
if you think that Betty off is just
pretending to be woke you know because
it looks good he's not that guy I spent
enough time with him I gave a speech for
Salesforce some years ago I spent some
time chatting with him and then sitting
at the table when he was interacting
with his lieutenants and stuff and
what I saw was a True Believer
there's no question in my mind he was
genuine from bottom to top
about making the world better while he
made money
now sales Salesforce has this uh one
percent thing I don't know if you've
heard of it I think they are encouraged
to give one percent of their money the
corporate money one percent to some
Charities and then you're encouraged to
spend one percent of your time doing
something for other people and there's
another one percent there somewhere I
think and
he he was pushing it and I've told this
story before but I watched him interact
with one of his top managers and the
manager was showing him the PowerPoint
presentation that they were going to
give and this was before
ESG and wokeness had even made a dent so
so he really was the OG of the stuff
and the the lieutenant would say all
right here's here's how the the thing is
going to look and then Danielle would
say all right this is good but put up
front
you know the the one percent thing yeah
we want to highlight that we're we're
doing things for the world
and then the manager said oh yeah that's
you know that's mentioned that's already
mentioned in here and then Betty off
said yes I know it's mentioned put it
first
and then the manager said well you know
I'm paraphrasing but the manager is like
well you know with the flow of things
you know really it fits down here and
Betty off looked at him and said Put it
first and
it was
it was sort of a cool moment of watching
a leader lead
and and watching a manager manage right
the manager was managing it's like oh
this is where it fits and the leader was
saying I don't think you're you're
catching on
first put it first and yeah of course he
got his way now
did this evolve into ESG
do you think that that's where it
started and it evolved into this I don't
know if there's a direct line there but
um here's what my take on ESG
in what world did it ever make sense
how could it ever make sense
that you would combine
climate change and diversity meaning
race for the most part but also gender
how did those things get in the same
acronym
environment social and governance
how did those ever become one thing
I have only one reason for this I can
think of one reason now this doesn't
mean this was intentional
it could be that it's like follow the
money things always just go the way they
go and there's a reason but we're not
always conscious of it I feel like the
reason that diversity and climate were
combined is that climate doesn't stand
by itself
and so you need to protect your climate
change policy arguments by saying if you
argue against this little package called
ESG well you're a freaking racist
so somehow they actually made racism
the protecting package for climate
policy
I hate ESG well you would be racist no I
I hate the climate part oh you say you
hate the climb apart but isn't it
convenient isn't it convenient that you
say you only disagree with the climate
policies how convenient that you're
white and white supremacist and also
you're disagreeing with diversity aren't
you aren't you no actually I like the
diversity I just don't like the climate
part of it yeah that's not the way
you're acting the way you're acting is
like a racist
do you think that's what it is
now again I'm not saying that somebody
had a meeting and said oh if we put
these together we'll be protected it
just feels like everybody knew
right it's like you knew if you
connected them they were smarter
that's what it feels like so I'm going
to go with that as my working philosophy
that the
that the social and governance were
thrown in there to sell climate change
because it couldn't stand on its own
because it's kind of tough to go to a
company and say you know you should
decrease your profits and you'll
definitely decrease your profits but
it's good for the world so do this
climate stuff it's kind of hard to sell
isn't it
now suppose you say this climate stuff
is good for the world but
diversity is not optional
then people say oh
well I guess we weren't really doing
diversity to make money anyway but it's
a good thing and we want to look like
good people so I guess we have to buy
the whole package
I think this is really just about
selling climate
because climate's where the money is am
I right there's a little bit of money in
selling racial Injustice
but that's mostly just the race grifters
you know maybe an author makes a good
Advance or something but if you're
talking about the money involved in
climate
that's trillions
climate is trillions
and so if you can use
the divisiveness of race to protect your
trillions of dollars of you know changed
activity that you're trying to change
and maybe get a bite of yourself
that's a really good play
so
one of the things that bellyoff argues
is that the there's research showing
that the companies that act like good
stewards of the environment and also
they're good on diversity they make more
money that their profits are higher what
do you think of that
I did not look at the research because I
don't need to
um the the research according to
benihoff says and that the the aware you
know the more awoke companies using my
own word not his make more money
do you know what's wrong with that
analysis I don't have to look at the
research to know this
and believe me
I don't have to look at it
here's what you need to know
only the companies who are making
ton of money do woke things
only the companies that are already just
by themselves
ridiculously profitable
for their own reasons they're the only
ones that go woke because they can
afford it the causation is backwards you
don't have a you don't have a struggling
company and then say my company is
struggling but if I layered on some ESG
requirements this thing would take off
like a rocket ship
that's not a thing
do you remember in search of Excellence
it was a it was the biggest Business
book in I don't know 90s early 90s and
the idea was that the the most
Progressive companies that treated their
employees the best got the best results
and I think Apple was an example like
you could get a back rub at work
and then the idea was well all the good
employees are going to work where they
can get the back rub at work and then
the ones who are already good will be
even better because now they're all
relaxed and they love their jobs and
stuff that and that was actually sold as
the number one Business book
that stupid idea
is largely how Dilbert was born on the
back of that Ridiculousness let me tell
you what was really happening well I
just did the companies that had extra
money look for ways to spend it they're
like how about bankrupts for employees
we got all this cash and we don't have
anything to invest in it we ran out of
good ideas and we still have cash so how
about doing something good for the
employees there is no causation from
being extra woke to being profitable
that does not exist now I'm not saying
they're incompatible there may be
companies that can pull it off
but look at the companies that are high
on the ESG
performance list did you know that apple
is one of the companies that's called
out as good for the environment and
diversity
just think about that
Apple
if you walked into the Apple engineering
department would they have a good
representation of black engineers
what do you think
I doubt it because I don't think
anybody's I don't think anybody's
cracked that yet because there's a
shortage of you know people to hire I
don't think they have diversity in their
Tech staff probably lots of Indian and
Asian but I don't think they have full
diversity
so I don't think they have anything like
diversity
and do you think that the iPhone is good
for the environment
not even a little bit
because of the rare earth minerals and
the mining and the you know there may or
may not be some uyghurs assembling them
and they may or may not be supporting
communist China which is bad on
everything
right you know in order to say that
apple is one of the good ones
you have to really stretch reality
I do think Apple might be one of the
better companies
I actually and by the way I own stock
and apple very good company for profits
for profit survey
but I think you would have to be very
selective about what you measured
say that Apple was a social Plus
does anybody think the cell phones are
destroying the country and killing our
youth
we all do what does Apple make they make
the phone that's destroying our youth
you know they don't make the social
media apps that are doing the worst part
but they carry them in their App Store
right they they are passed through of
the probably the most
um damaging thing in modern society
which is Tick Tock and social media
I'm in favor of keeping Twitter by the
way because kids don't use it for the
most part
um
so ESG is ridiculous and I'm thinking
that one of the reasons it's hard to uh
argue against it is not only that they
cleverly put the diversity in with the
climate stuff
but also the people don't understand it
would you agree with that
you know within the political junkies
that watch a show like this you have an
idea what it is but the average person
you know unless they work in a
corporation where it's their job or it's
being forced upon them they don't know
what the letter stand for
so you can't really you know get public
opinion on your side or anything like
that so if you were going to argue
against this
arguing on the merits would probably not
work because it's too complicated
there are merits then the mayor argument
goes like this if you require companies
to serve Too Many Masters you will get a
bad result
it's something everybody understands
I'll try restarting the
restarting the locals see if that works
I don't think so because I
yeah it doesn't work for me
I just get a dead page
so let me show you what I'm getting
this is any people on locals who want to
say it's just a dead page there's
nothing there
so I've I've quit the app and restarted
a number of times I don't know maybe
it's me but
it's not up for me all I can tell you is
I just quit it and opened it it's the
same
and there doesn't seem to be a mode to
get out of this it's just uh infinite
blank pages
let's see if other people are up yeah
and Dave Rubin
I don't think so I think we're just dead
oh wait a minute something just came up
hold on
hello
we're uh nope only somebody else's
locals Dave Rubens is up
that's interesting it looks oh Rumble is
down too
oh oh if rumbles it Rumble is down it's
on the same servers okay
all right here if you were going to try
to argue against uh ESG like Vivek
ramaswamy is
um being smarter than the people you're
talking to is not the best strategy
um
everything's down
is it just Crowder is the only thing
working this morning it's a good day for
Crowder
good going Crowder
uh
so you're saying that locals is working
for some of you right now
that can't be there's no way that that
could be true
I don't believe it could work for you
and not work for me I mean technically
that's possible but
yeah it's dead
is a door now
yeah I don't think it's yeah it's dead
all right if I were trying to fight
against the SG and let's say a
trump-like way and I just tried to
persuade and I wasn't trying to be um
you know technically accurate I would
come up with something else the ESG
means that's funnier
than what it's supposed to mean
so how about ESG is extra socialist
government
how do you like that one extra socialist
government for ESG
I don't think socialist works
because the people who are who like ESG
like socialism so probably that wouldn't
work
um
how about saying uh ESG is reparations
how about that
no you don't need reparations because
that's what ESG is
it's big corporations trying to increase
the number of people of color and gender
and everything else so you don't need so
when reparations comes up you just say
oh we already have that it's called ESG
because the people who don't know what
ESG is also don't know it's not
reparations
so that would be a dirty trick kind of
uh unethical persuasion but
suppose the only way you could kill a
thing that's going to kill the country
because I think ESG could actually end
the country
probably not but it has a it does have
an Extinction risk because if you just
can't get out of this mode your economy
is just going to go right in the in the
crapper
so if you had to do something slightly
unethical to get rid of something that
is uh potentially the worst thing that's
happened in the country
is that still unethical
to to use persuasion to get a good
result if the persuasion is not exactly
honest
because if you don't like persuasion
that's not exactly honest how could you
ever vote for a presidential campaign
every presidential candidate persuades
dishonestly all of them there's nobody
who doesn't it's never been done it's
all dishonest but we're okay with that
why are we okay with that everybody who
votes votes for somebody they know lied
everybody because they all lied
so I'm not suggesting that you do
anything unethical
it would be better to try to hold the
line on the ethical stuff try to try to
be that person but I don't know of an
ethical way
to stop ESG
because if you get into the ethical
argument you're you're where Vivek is
which he's trying to argue on the merits
and I don't think he can because the
public is not um sophisticated enough or
interested enough to follow along okay I
like these things but you're saying it
has this downside how do I weigh the
downside versus the things I do like
about it because I like the climate you
know I just I just don't know that you
can win on logic
the only people who are going to buy the
argument that ESG is bad for the economy
are people who have a background in that
stuff
and they're already on that side the the
people who have a background in
management
probably all agree
you know unless it's a somebody who's
signaling on behalf of the company
although I will say again
that in my opinion Mark Betty off is the
real deal
it's just that other companies can't do
what he's doing because he's insanely
profitable insanely profitable so they
can you know they can lead in this so I
like that I like the fact that he's he
knows he's insanely profitable so they
can lead on things that he thinks needs
some leadership
well DeSantis did an interview with
Pierce Morgan and said some things that
made some news and of course because it
involves Trump uh it is wildly taken out
of context and uh
just turned into something important
when it wasn't so what DeSantis said was
some mild
rebuke of Trump's Style
very mild
so first of all he did not come out and
say Trump should not be arrested
which I think Trump supporters needed to
hear if they were ever going to support
DeSantis
for any reason and I think the fact that
he didn't come out and just say all
right no matter what you think of trump
this arrest is wrong
that's what people wanted him to say and
so the lack of saying that
looks like an ethical lapse doesn't it
it seems like an ethical lapse which is
worse
than some other types of lapses because
one of the things that DeSantis has
going for him is this fairly solid
record of doing useful things that his
base likes
so that's his strength
the the minute he gets into
some of the other rhetoric stuff he's
not so strong
so here are the mild things he said
about Trump and he pretty much confirmed
he's planning to run but he hasn't
announced
um
he said uh something like
um he would have if he if he were
president it would be drama-free
so that's like an indirect but kind of
direct
you know uh statement that he wouldn't
have Trump's baggage
now everybody knows that right
like that's pretty much the entire
argument for DeSantis is a he would be
trump-like without some of the negatives
but
uh I don't think he's selling that
what he says that Trump is drama all you
hear is why is he attacking somebody on
his own team and why is he doing it
especially why is he doing it when Trump
might get arrested
like that the timing of his criticism
now I don't criticize him for that
uh I think saying that he would not
bring as much drama As Trump
at the same time Trump might be getting
arrested
that feels like the right time to say it
honestly it doesn't feel like so much of
an attack as it is a statement of what
makes him different
I know an attack would be something
unfair
and an attack isn't pointing out what we
all see we all see that his value
proposition is less drama you know with
trump-like sensibilities
all right
uh
corporate incentives did Crowder
actually crash Rumble
is that what happened
because this is his first day he's uh
he's going at the same time as I am
Nikki Haley is Bolton with a weave
that's funny the poor man's John Bolton
all right well I don't think uh I'm not
going to criticize DeSantis for his bad
timing or his uh comments about Trump
because I think they were mild
and they were
observably true
and he was asked questions about running
I don't think that he was thinking about
the timing when he said it I think he
was just answering the question
I'm okay with that I don't have a big
problem with that
but it would be better if he had
supported Republicans in general against
getting arrested for BS
um
Mexican president had something to say
about our situation I saw a tweet from
kanakoa the Great
so he says that President Mexico
Mexico's President amlau says the United
States cannot talk about human rights
with uh under these situations Julie
Julian assangeas detained
and I thought that's sort of a good
point and he says uh can't talk about
cartel violence when President Joe Biden
is bombing the Nordstrom pipeline
huh that's not a bad point
and then he says we can't talk about
democracy while we're arresting the
leading presidential candidate Donald
Trump
and drop the mic
yep
Mexico
is high grounding America
Mexico the cartel-ridden society
is making good points about how you the
United States isn't looking that much
better
now I think the cartel situation is
worse than this stuff but these are
pretty solid points pretty solid points
if you're arresting the president
leading presidential candidate
um you can't talk about democracy you
can't talk about democracy you can't
sorry that is taken away from you
um
let's talk about the charges
uh if your charges are ever called
Looney
chances are you're not going to
prosecute you're probably not going to
get it so let me explain uh the charges
and why it's a felony
something about a misdemeanor that
wasn't enough something about another
thing that's combined okay I can't even
understand the story it's so stupid
there isn't a slightest chance that that
these charges are going to pass any kind
of
you know higher Challenge in a higher
Court I don't know what's going to
happen locally but there's a slightest
chance this could work
so it's obviously just political we now
know that everybody involved ran to get
Trump before they even had a charge we
know that they had to concoct
a legal theory that other people say is
just ridiculous
and we know the timing is obviously
political it's just every part of this
is just Banana Republic
you know there are definitely things
about Trump that I would say oh you know
maybe you did need to look into that
but this isn't one of them this is not
one of them this is a pure political act
which uh if anything is working right
you should propel them into the
presidency just just as a reaction
well uh
I saw that uh I saw a reference in on
Fox News
that Michael Cohen had paid
uh Stormy Daniels to keep her mouth shut
that's the way Greg Jarrett said it that
Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels a porn
star to keep her mouth shut
well I thought I thought Michael Cohen
was a bit of a loser but in the history
of
human civilization
he is the first person who ever paid a
porn star to keep her mouth shut
first one
and I don't think he's doing anything
right as it turns out
looks like he's doing everything wrong
so keep an eye on that
um I heard some mocking from Democrats
because there were more Trump haters who
showed up to protest in New York than
there were Trump supporters
huh
I wonder if there's anything in the
environment
that would cause Trump supporters to not
want to do a political protest in favor
of trump is there any factors that are
going on at the moment
yeah how about the fact that Trump
protesters get put in jail for charges
that don't look
sufficient
yeah I think that could be a reason why
the crowds are a little weak
they don't want to go to jail
because we're not really a you know a
serious country anymore
all right uh here's a little story do
you remember that country star Morgan
Wallen he got canceled because there was
some video of him that surfaced when he
drunkenly used the n-word
and it was shortly after some black
lives matter protest
and so he got canceled
and it wasn't too long ago it was 2021 I
guess
but he has the number one hit right now
he has the number one hit and he's
dominating the charts in general
now the question is
is it because I don't listen to his
music so I'm not familiar is he that
good
it is just good music and that's the
whole story or is this
the political right voting with their
wallets
to on cancel them
it feels like people are voting with
their wallets doesn't it and they're
they're just trying to balance things
out it's like well he got canceled
but we don't think that was worthy of
cancellation so we're going to bring him
back we're going to resurrect them it
looks like the political right
resurrected and you know I can speak to
this with some experience which is there
is now a robust
anti-cancellation industry
and that's really good
it certainly helped me because the
moment I got canceled uh offers started
pouring in
you know and so I didn't realize that
the the let's say the
protective economic wrapping that is
immediately applied to the canceled if
the people who like that cancer person
think that was unfair
so the amount of support that I got
being canceled was shocking I I didn't
expect it and the amount of economic
offers
very welcome didn't expect it but more
importantly the existence of you know
something like a rumble or locals gives
you some place that you can monetize
your canceled situation
and that is really really important I'll
tell you the the contribution that Dave
Rubin has made to free speech
I think you should get
honestly some kind of uh like what what
is the big award presidents give it
what's that called it's like the freedom
award or what what's the biggest
non-military award you can get
not the Nobel but an American the medal
of freedom
yeah I think if Trump gets elected
Dave Rubin and the other founders of uh
of locals and Rumble too I think they
should get Medals of freedom because
what they're doing is a substantial
benefit to freedom of speech the
Practical freedom of speech I get it
that only the government can block your
freedom of speech First Amendment blah
blah blah I understand the Constitution
but in a practical way
what they've done is make it safer for
people to say what they want to say
yeah that's a big big deal and I will be
forever
I will have gratitude for that because
it made a difference in my life
must too must too yes thank you Elon
musk's contribution to freedom of speech
the Practical side not the
Constitutional side but the Practical
side is uncalculable it's just enormous
foreign
yes all right uh Putin and president XI
of China met in a big show of support
for each other and they put out five
points that they agree on
and one of them was that uh quote Russia
and China strongly oppose violating
interests of other countries to gain our
own advantage
I wonder if anybody's trying to do that
uh
is Russia trying to violate the
interests of any countries is China
putting Jets over Taiwan every single
day
well how do how do Russia and China
get to say something this ballsy
well let me tell you
it's because Russia says Ukraine is part
of Russia and China says Taiwan is part
of China
it's easy
yeah you know what I also I also believe
that the United States should never
conquer any other countries we should
never conquer another question Cuba is
kind of part of America I mean if I'm
being honest cube is basically Florida
so that doesn't count because that's
just part of America so if we were to
militarily invade Cuba I would say that
is not violating the interests of
another country
no no that's unifying the existing
country
duh obviously
so that was funny
why does war have rules
whenever there's a war like a
traditional war and they have rules even
terrorists have rules have you noticed
that the terrorists only do certain
kinds of Terror
all right I gotta blow something up or
maybe machine gun some people
but of the billion other things you
could do
they'll only do those things
some kind of weird rule even terrorists
have rules it's the weirdest thing
but now Putin is complaining because the
UK might well well they confirmed
they're sending a Munitions ammunition
Canadian depleted uranium
now the experts say that poses little or
no risk to humans unless they get shot
of course
so it's not the kind of atomic problem
of like a nuclear breakdown or a nuclear
war but Putin's making a sound like this
is part of you know it's it's in the
Continuum with nuclear weapons
it isn't has nothing to do with nuclear
weapons it's just a scientific kind of
way you can imagine there's some
connection to them right
um yeah so the reason I use the depleted
uranium is it can penetrate stuff more
effectively
so but Putin is warning well you know we
might have to
um you know respond in kind which makes
you think maybe nukes
but I predict no nukes I just think it's
weird that a war like this would have
rules
all right we will use our drones to give
you Intel but we won't give you our best
tanks yes we will but maybe somebody
else's tanks
basically we're managing the war like
it's a game with rules
why do why do Wars have rules
like I understand why we do it
but it just seems like it's making a war
look nonsensical it makes the lives of
the people dying look ridiculous
it makes it look like a waste if you're
not going to play to win
I know maybe you shouldn't start a war
so I guess the point of War Modern War
he is trying to convince the public that
the other side is violating those rules
and whoa you violated those War crime
rules so what kind of a war are you
fighting that's not a fair War sure
we're blowing human beings to bits every
day but that's not the bad problem the
bad problem is you didn't follow the
rules like nobody's saying
what about the ukrainians that were
ripped apart by artillery you know their
bodies just ripped apart
well that's not the big problem
the big problem is you might have
cheated a little bit on the unspoken
rules about what this war is and what it
isn't we don't want you cheating on
those rules we'll just blow human beings
into bits
because that's allowed that's allowed
under the rules
so Rasmussen did a poll on Ukraine and
at the moment 50 percent of likely U.S
voters believe the Russian invasion of
Ukraine has made America's national
security situation worse
up from 42 percent
um how could it have made it better
I mean
I I think it looks worse
um 45 believe it would be better for
American interest if Ukraine keeps
fighting until the Russian invasion is
completely defeated so almost half the
country
thinks the best path is fighting until
Russia is completely defeated
sounds a little bit risky it's easy to
say if you're not in the war
um 41 think of a bit better if Ukraine
negotiates for peace
so and apparently the Democrats are more
for the war than the Republicans that's
quite a switch isn't it have we have we
seen something like a complete switch
now
the Liberals that became the
conservatives and the conservatives
became the Liberals because it used to
be that the Republicans liked War and
the Democrats were protesting it now
it's the Democrats like this war
and the Republicans are more
more resistant
um
yeah
let me give one more try to locals it's
not like it makes a difference at this
point
nope still down or at least mine is down
there's new science that says life
probably came from asteroids we got
these asteroids that uh
I think Japan was able to get some
samples from the asteroid which is kind
of impressive by itself that you can
give samples from an asteroid
um and it's got uh
let's see they found uracil
one of the building blocks of RNA as
well as vitamin B3 or niacin so these
are
factors which a an organic creature
would need so it's more evidence that
life
originated from meteors and asteroids
hitting the Earth now here's my question
to you
for those of you who like science but
also like God
if science
goes further and I don't think they're
there yet but if they prove that life
let's say proof to your satisfaction
that life came from asteroids
what would that do to your belief that
God created humans
would you just say well that's how we
did it you just brought some asteroids
to Earth
combine them and just waited
or would you say oh I denounced My
Religion because science has proven that
life
just came from asteroids or would you
say well God created whatever life
that that stuff came from
or
would you say it's not from asteroids
after all
see I think that religion is going to
come under Challenge from this where we
actually suppose we actually
grab enough stuff from meteors someday
to assemble a living creature
what about that
because I think you know the the only
God can make a tree thing I feel like
we're maybe 20 years away from just
combining chemicals and creating a
creature
what then
you know would would you still think
that God did it or what do you think an
advanced civilization of humans did it
or some creatures that were just smart
well I think AI is going to challenge us
on Consciousness and sentience and soul
and I think this is going to challenge
religion on how did it all get started
I don't think people are going to give
up religion
um they'll probably just interpret it in
a way that keeps a religion that's what
I think they'll just interpret it that
way has Trump been arrested yet is that
still on
does anybody know
who created the simulation Scott well I
believe that we live in a circular
reality
which means that
everything that happens
will happen again
we just have to go into full circle for
example
the universe you know starts and expands
but at some point it's going to have to
say the scientist will contract back
into the singularity
so if that's the case
that means that everything's a like a
like a repeating Loop
if everything is a repeating Loop
nothing had a beginning
time doesn't have a beginning
because it's it's continuous in a circle
if something's continuous in a circle
and the very same things come into being
over and over again not a different set
of things the same things
then it means that we are always caused
by
a higher level uh entity
and they are always caused by something
before that caused me something before
so in other words
people could cause people
it's possible
people could cause people
so there's always a person before you
just have to follow the circle back as
oh this is before this this is before
this but also this is after this
so it could be that our notion of time
doesn't make sense
so I'm more likely to see the problem is
if you say God created it
you've just reproduced the problem
because you know who created God and
then if you want to make it go away say
well God Is Timeless okay I don't know
what that means
but here's how God could be timeless
if we were to create a video game in
which the creatures didn't believe they
were real
uh the time in our life as the creators
of the simulation would not be the same
time that the simulation experiences for
example the simulation can experience an
entire infinity or let's say the from
The Big Bang through
the year 2023 it's possible that a
simulation could compress that into 10
minutes
so that the time of you know the
god-like creatures who created the
simulation
would be a whole different time we would
be outside of time and unaffected by
time that's in the simulation so yeah it
might be that God is just the Creator
and it's outside of time
um
all right
God is everything how many of you have
ever read my book of God's debris
is there anybody here who's read God's
debris
because if you want to see an
alternative view that's uh not any of
the stuff I mentioned today so it'd be
outside of that if you want to see a
view of God that you have never seen
before
but many people say
blew their mind and it was the best book
they ever read it's called God's debate
now I don't know if you can buy it
anymore it might be hard to get in a
bookstore because I'm so canceled but
it's free on the internet I made it free
before I made it available for purchase
so I think if you just Google free
download of God's debris you can find it
if you're wondering if I'm trying to
make money
I'm always trying to make money but you
could have it for free if you like I I
made that available so I mean that's on
me
um
did Andrew Tate deliver you a package
and have a chat no why would you think
you would
somebody tell you that he did
um but no we've never chatted
I don't think you can chat with anyone
oh it blew your mind my book good
all right it's Turtles all the way down
all right I'm gonna go see if I can
figure out what's wrong with the locals
app
yes Einstein said that their time is an
illusion space-time is all that exists
um
all right that's all for now
thanks for joining
it's our smallest live stream yet but uh
I'll talk to you tomorrow
