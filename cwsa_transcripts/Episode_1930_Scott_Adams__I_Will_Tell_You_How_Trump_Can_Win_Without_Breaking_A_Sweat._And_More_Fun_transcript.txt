up up
good morning everybody and welcome
to another highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I don't think there's been a finer
experience in your life
and if you'd like to see if you could
pull that up another notch and I think
you can oh I think you can here's what
you need all you need is a cupboard mug
or a glass of tanker Chelsea style and a
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
here the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
that happens now go
ah
and if you're looking at my handsome mug
that is perfect in every way
and saying to yourself whoa
I wish I could get one of those there's
still a few available for the local
subscribers
uh so
wherever wherever the information is on
getting that
I forget the link I'm sure Eric I can
give you the link
Erica the excellent will remind you of
the link
all right so uh Wall Street Journal is
reporting that the thing that damn near
killed me this summer is actually a
common thing
and I'd never heard of it before
so and the common thing is that old
people and I'm now putting myself in
that category
will often think that their age is why
they they can't move like can't climb up
the stairs and oh I'm so sore and all my
my joints ache and stuff it turns out
it's this massive problem that's
actually caused by their medications
but they don't know it
just like me that's that was my exact
situation I didn't know
that it was anything I was doing I
thought I was just old I thought oh damn
I finally reached that age where walking
up the stairs is going to be like
torture for the rest of my life
as soon as I got off my blood pressure
meds
one day completely solved I can I can
bounce up the stairs like a teenager you
can do anything I want I can work out
all day long
the literally the only reason I leave
the gym is because I got to do some
other stuff I can just stay there all
day and keep working out and I'm not
sore
now it's not because I'm Superman or
anything apparently
uh I think our pharmaceutical industry
is just killing old people
might be saving their lives too
but I got a feeling that people are just
being killed by just legal drugs it's
looking like it
so watch out for that if you know any
seniors who seem to be super
unable to move
check out the medications
might be that they're also the Wall
Street Journal is also saying it might
be long covered but I don't feel like
that's proven yet do you
I feel like there might be something to
it
but uh but I don't think long covet is
proven exactly is it
but anyway that was mentioned in the
story
do you remember uh Roseanne uh bars show
the Connors
and when Roseanne got canceled so did
the show but it's it's back
is back
and it shows a promotional picture of
the new family new actors with uh all
wearing coven masks and that's that's
their promotional poster
not new what do you mean it's not new
is it not new because it's been on a
while I mean somebody says it's not new
but it made me wonder if
it's a do poster it made me wonder if uh
whoever does the Connors
uh did Elon Musk fire their marketing
department too
because if you're introducing a new cast
and they're wearing masks
I think you did it wrong
let me let me give you the one thing
I've learned I may have told you this
story before
years ago
Newsweek contacted me and said hey we're
considering
putting a Dilbert character on the cover
of Newsweek back when Newsweek was
actually a big deal
and I said oh wow and they said can you
draw something oh by the way we're
considering a second alternative so we
can't guarantee that Dilbert will be on
the cover
but we'd like to see what you come up
with and then we'll compare it to our
other alternative
so I said what is that other alternative
well we would put an attractive female
model on the cover
instead of a Dilbert character
and you know we'll probably test to see
which one gets more attention before we
decide I guess they do a little tests of
that stuff
and I said
in other words you're wasting my
time
and they said no no no no no we're like
we're really seriously considering both
options and I said there isn't any way
in the world
that a comic character gets more
eyeballs from the general public than an
attractive female face
I said don't you can really make me do
this work complete waste of time
but I got talked into it yeah they might
and that would be a big deal
so I do my artwork I give it to him and
they say yeah we tested it it seems this
turns out this this attractive female
face got more attention
oh
now that's an example of something I
wouldn't fall for at my current age
right when I was a little less
experienced I was sort of on the bubble
like I was just experienced enough to
know it was probably a waste of time
but I wasn't experienced enough to tell
them to go themselves which I would
do today
because that was the right answer go
 yourself was the right answer to
why don't you just do a bunch of work
and we'll compare it to this other thing
that's obviously going to be the winner
anyway
um it appears we have a strategy that
the media and the Democrats have come up
with uh and maybe even maybe even
Republican types and conservatives who
don't want Trump to win
it seems they're going to starve him of
attention
have you noticed did you notice that
after Trump announced first of all it
didn't didn't get covered everywhere
and then it was just like silence uh
here's one line did did you know Trump
he announced he's going to run for
president
it's like everybody acted like it didn't
happen
I think they're on to him
they finally figured out what an energy
monster is
will it be good enough
well
I give you and I hate to do this
as my example
Andrew Tate
Andrew Tate got canceled everywhere they
tried to turn him off but he just went
to the podcast
and the podcast made you know infinite
number of uh viral little videos of
things he said
and then and he's everywhere can you
avoid Andrew Tate
Tate Tate
is it it's probably not just the
algorithm sending it all to me is it but
you see him everywhere don't you he's
all over Instagram he's all over Twitter
right and so by canceling him he he
created a model that I'll give him
credit for this he created a model where
if he does lots of quotable stuff on
podcasts those things always get you
know sent to uh
social media and then nobody can control
it or at least as obviously all right
they could suppress it a little bit but
not not as obviously
that's a model that would work
so if the if the mainstream media
continues to suppress Trump you can do
the same thing
just go out all the podcasts
do little video clips of the one thing
he said that was like really quotable
just as good as the regular media
just as good so I don't think the media
can shut him out
if he decides to the podcast route
we'll see
all right let me tell you
um
how Trump can win
without breaking a sweat
and I'll remind all of you that I don't
have a favorite uh candidate for this
upcoming 2024 election because I'm a
single issue voter on Fentanyl and
nobody's may be happy on that if
somebody does I'm all in
doesn't matter who it is Democrat
Republican I'll go with anybody who can
solve that problem
uh so if I say something that sounds
good about Trump just put it in the
context that if it were Biden I would
also say it was good and I have I think
you can confirm at this point that I've
noted that Biden has done a number of
things that were persuasion correct and
I've noted them
a number of things that weren't but you
know that works both ways all right
number one a lot of smart people are
telling us that Trump cannot win
you've heard that right Trump can't win
oh sure he might get through the
primaries
but in a general
um there's not enough Republican support
because they're mad at him and there
certainly wouldn't be Democrat support
so you can't possibly win so basically
any Democrat could be Trump right
and that sounds
actually kind of true doesn't it
would you dispute that
if Trump can't even get the Republicans
on his side
can't win
right
all right now let me play with your
brains a little bit let's say you accept
that that's true
now tell me the person who can win
what you'll find is that nobody can win
we've actually created a situation where
if you do a straight line projection of
every single candidate democrat or
republican none of them can win
right so there I don't think there's any
Republican that can get past Trump in
the primary
correct I don't think DeSantis would I
think I think true Trump would take him
out in the primary but I also don't
think he's going to enter the primaries
that would be a disastrously stupid
mistake
now I'm not trying to discourage him I
think he'd be great
I think he'd be a strong candidate I
think I'd like to see the country decide
on DeSantis wouldn't you wouldn't you
like to see if the country could be
comfortable with him
that would be really interesting to me
but I don't think it's in his best
interest and I think that's how he
should make the decision and I think he
will so here's the problem with DeSantis
why do you like DeSantis
the reason you like him is he continues
to make decisions that are objectively
smart would you agree
it's just like he lines them up smart
smart smart smart smart smart smart
smart smart smart smart smart
and they're not crazy
you know I think he went too far with
Disney small small thing right
so if you think DeSantis is exactly who
you imagine him to be is the person who
makes smart decisions
do you think it would be smart for him
to give up the most uh storied and
successful governor in my life
he would give that up
when his kids are a certain age and
entering the the national race would
destroy him
why not just wait until Trump's not in
the race
2028 and then you just walk into the job
if you want it and you have that long to
decide if you want it
that this is not a hard decision
that if DeSantis enters the race he's
not the person you thought he was
because that would he would be an idiot
let me say as clearly as I can
if you think desensis is smart you have
to think he's not going to run
if he runs I will have to change my
opinion of his intelligence
honestly I would change my opinion I'd
love to see him run but it would be
stupid
it would be stupid and you know he knows
that right because that's why you like
him the whole reason you like him is
he's not dumb enough to uh to walk into
a buzzsaw right oh there's that smart
guy I like why is he walking into that
buzz saw that everybody in the world can
see is a puzzle you won't
you won't I think that's my prediction
all right so if it's not DeSantis
nobody else can take Trump out can they
I mean Trump could take himself out
somehow but
let's say he doesn't
all right so now you've got a you've got
a scenario in which there's no other
Republican that can or would win
so now the only question is which which
Democrat can beat Trump
well Hillary Clinton was pretty strong
wasn't she
say there's a Democrat that can be Trump
you're ignoring all of his skill
and you're also ignoring that the that
the Republicans are going to and
complain and then pull the lever for
Trump because they're not going to pull
the lever for uh Newsome or somebody
else
now do you think that a adult a younger
adult white male let's say Newsome could
win the Democratic nomination
I don't know it only depends how women
like it
because the Democratic party is just the
woman party at this point if women say
you know
we especially young white women if they
are pro-newson you know they think he's
handsome they they think he did a good
job in in California or something
he'd be pretty strong
but I don't know if they can go one more
cycle nominating another white guy
do you think the Democrats can go one
more cycle nominating another white guy
I don't know
and do you think that uh if if the Trump
team includes
Newsome's ex-wife
do you think news's ex-wife knows
anything about him that would be
damaging in a big election
[Laughter]
that would be pretty that would probably
be a pretty risky thing how would you
like to run a national election and your
ex-wife's on the other team
do you think she knows where his weak
spots are
it's the worst case scenario for him
now I happen to think that Newsome has
all of the tools
he has all of the tools
right looks good talks good young enough
experienced
you know it probably would have tons of
backing in his own team I think he has
all the tools but maybe his time has
passed because the Republican party is
just not
they're not the white man party anymore
and I think you might find that out
so anyway let me tell you how Trump can
win
um
in lots of ways so first of all you
would scare off all of his GOP
Challengers or just beat them in the
primaries and I think most of you would
agree that that's going to happen
would you would most of you give me that
Trump is going to win the primary
at this point
even if people believe
they can't win the general I think he's
still win the primary
all right here's what he could do you
could use podcast to get around the
media barriers and then the podcast
creates all these little viral videos
and then that's his campaign
um
he could start his campaign by debunking
the hoaxes
you you've seen my what is it 14 or 15
hoaxes against mostly against Trump
he should just start and say
here's what they said about the fine
people uh situation and then show show
the video of him denying it it's right
there and then show what they cut out
so you can see how the hoax was created
then do the same thing for the drinking
bleach Oaks
here's the actual study that was in the
news when I said it here's me saying
that light is a disinfectant
here's me saying at the end yeah we're
talking about light and then you can see
that the video is a snippet that cut off
the two light references and you can see
that it was a real thing in the news and
you and you can confirm that it was in
an account I follow
um and then they say why did you say it
was just sarcasm well I was just trying
to make it go away
just say that
why'd you say sarcasm honestly I just
wanted to make it go away it wasn't
important
that would be a perfect answer would it
not
if you heard him say no I just said it
was sarcasm because it wasn't important
I thought it would just go away
I didn't want to explain it
right
so if he started by debunking all of the
hoaxes against him
guess which one he could add to the list
as of today
The Washington Post reports
that the documents at Mar-A-Lago
were just personal mementos of no
importance whatsoever
no nuclear secrets nothing of business
potential nothing he could sell nothing
that had any monetary value
it was just souvenirs
and when did they decide to report that
after the midterms
does everybody see it now I realize
Republicans have been able to see it for
a while
but does doesn't everybody see it now
like that that's some big
coincidence that they just said ah I
guess that was nothing at all I guess it
was just some documents in a box
just some documents in a box that's all
it was
now imagine Trump having something like
half an hour of camera time
and and a really high uh let's say he
what he would need is a visual
production team
somebody would create the the graphics
and the comp accompany him debunking
each of the hoaxes so you'd have like a
one-page debunk
that could travel on social media along
with every hoax
so every time somebody mentioned any of
the hoaxes for his entire campaign you
could take the the one image created by
Trump's own team
that very easily summarizes how the hoax
was created and what made it hoax
right so that every time it comes up it
just gets passed around social media
here here's how they did it here's how
the hoax works
you could easily do it with a yeah you
could show the headlines
here are the headlines you know here's
what happened here's how they admitted
it was a hoax or here's how we prove
it's a hoax
see this is this is something that Trump
needs to get better at
he is excellent at creating Clips where
he's the star
you know he's talking
but he hasn't figured out how to use
graphic
um persuasion yet something separate
from his image and if he got the right
people that would be devastating
all right so if he debunks the hoaxes
here are some things that he could
promise that would make him unbeatable
the following proposition would make
Trump unbeatable with all of his current
known flaws
right
goes like this number one let's not talk
about past elections but I'm going to
give you more election transparency than
you've ever had before
I guarantee that will be a high priority
we'll do what we can to get better
election transparency make them more
auditable but let's not complain about
what did or did not happen let's put it
behind us
could he say that
that would be that would take a lot of
discipline wouldn't it that would take a
lot of discipline but it is The High
Ground what have I taught you about High
Ground persuasion
once you find The High Ground that the
debate is over
if Trump said let's forget the past and
work hard on you know bipartisan
election transparency
it's done
it's done
nobody can can can argue about that
position that's what The High Ground is
you recognize it right the reason I
always give you examples of The High
Ground is that they're all a little
different
yeah you have to see her like a whole
basket of them before you could make
your own right but you see it right the
first person who says that forget about
the past we you know it's going to be a
big effort to get a transparency
the whole public says Ah Yeah I'm I'm
okay with that
there's no there's nothing left to talk
about
all right here's uh what else he could
do he could have a aggressive fentanyl
plan including uh physically attacking
the uh Mexican
um fentanyl plants
uh I've tested this idea online and I
can tell you that the public is ready
for it
the pub the public is ready for a
military attack on Mexico and I base
that on the responses to my social media
the biggest response was Scott do you
realize
that's an act of War
to which I say
do you realize that's the point
yes I am I am advocating as clearly as I
can and active war against the country
of Mexico
in an unambiguous way I want them to
know this is an act of War
and we're going to treat it like a war
right now do you think he could lose if
he said fentanyl if he says that
unfentionally he gets all the white
women who know somebody who died of
fentanyl back
that's enough
that's enough
right now so he get me back completely
with a good fentanyl plan he doesn't
quite have it yet but he's he's poking
around the edges
I mean he's definitely getting close to
one but he doesn't quite have it yet
next the way he should deal with the
January 6 allegations is to mock them as
ridiculous the way I do and the way many
of you do
yes the media told you that Republicans
the most armed people in the world
stage stage and Insurrection without
bringing weapons or at least if they
brought them they don't brandish them
he should make that look like a
joke
say yeah you should worry about people
with bison hats taking over the
government
and if somebody asks them about the
Insurrection here's what I would do
let's say it's one of these
insufferable media people you have
somebody from ABC or something
you just say them let me ask you a
question
do you think that Republicans believe
they could conquer the United States by
taking over a room
just make them answer the question just
just walk me through it how did you
think that was going to work
and did you think those Republicans who
didn't bring weapons or didn't brandish
them do you think that they thought they
could hold that room and from there they
would control the United States
just tell me you're thinking about it
like I just want to understand how you
could look at this situation and think
it's a you've asked the question
how can you even ask the question
you should never answer it you should
mock it into into the irrelevance that
it is
now
he can't do this next part but it'd be
great if he could
I wish I'd handled it differently
right it wouldn't take much
wouldn't take much you just I think the
public needs that little bit
they just need a little bit I wish I'd
handled it differently
right
now he could never do that but it
wouldn't take much to just say I wish I
had handled it differently it didn't
work out for me
all right let's go on here's how we'll
see Trump could win without breaking a
sweat
uh do you know how the uh the Democrats
in my opinion were super successful in
the midterms because they were smart
enough to know that if you tell somebody
something will be taken away from them
that's more scary then I promise I'll
give you some free stuff
now that effect is so strong that I
think it determined the midterms we're
going to take away your bodily autonomy
you said the Democrats
we're going to take away your democracy
said the Democrats
and what were the Republicans promising
to give you
well I don't know
well but it doesn't matter what they
promised to give you
what they promised to give you will
never compete with what somebody says
they're going to take away
right the takeaway is just the thing so
here's how Trump
could phrase his campaign as Democrats
taking away stuff
so imagine if he he phrased his whole
campaign as they're taking your
right so here's the stuff they're taking
from you
um
they're taking away your freedom of
speech with wokeness
they're taking away your ability to
Simply express yourself in the way that
you know in your god-given way
isn't that stronger if you say wokeness
is bad you're like I don't know maybe it
is maybe it doesn't I kind of like
wokeness but if they say we're they're
going to take away your freedom of
speech you're like what yeah you can't
say stuff now
they're taking that away
um how about taking away your retirement
inflation is taking away your 401k
the Democrats are bleeding your 401k
they're taking away your your chance of
a happy retirement
you feel that
just just just let me say it again and
watch how your body goes into just fear
well if you're a certain age if you're
young not watch I can I can activate
your Shear response just by saying the
Democrats are draining your 401k
everything you've worked for they're
taking it from you
you're going to retire into poverty if
you let the Democrats keep doing this
did you feel it
you could feel that as I'm talking right
that's not that's not like a
intellectual point you feel raped when I
say that don't you I mean I'm being you
know using the word figuratively
right you feel actually raped by that
just the sentences
um do you remember when you felt safe in
your community Democrats took that from
you
Democrats took from you
you're right to happiness to just walk
outside and feel safe
and they're going to take more of that
from you and they're not going to give
it back
how about having a country that you knew
had real borders and you were safe from
external threats they took that from you
they took that from you by opening the
Border you don't know what you're
getting
how about women being able to do women's
sports I'm not on this point but you
know so these are not my opinions I'm
just saying what one could say that how
about uh your your daughters in sports
they wanted to do well they wanted to
win they're taking that from you
that would be the trans argument I don't
make that argument I think sports are
broken not trans I think trans people
are fine
the way we organize the sports is
sub-optimal also causes a problem
um
so do you accept my point that
everything that Trump talks about could
be uh let's take climate change
they're trying to take from you your
future
by you know scaring you here's what he
could do with climate change because
he's very weak on climate change
here's a winning message on climate
change
you know I'm not going to argue with the
scientists who say that CO2 causes
warming
because I think most Republicans believe
that
that that CO2 does cause warming what
they don't believe is the Doom and Gloom
portion of it
now you I I know that not all of you
believe it the CO2 causes warming I'm
saying that most Republicans do
it's standard science now
the but what people don't necessarily
believe is the predictions
or that you know will be dead so I think
I think if he added some Nuance to his
opinion you know I think there is some
risk from this warming
but there might be a greater risk in the
way we deal with it
wouldn't you love that
there is a risk of global warming I
think there are enough scientists making
that case that it would be unwise for me
to doubt it
but
there's also a risk
for handling it wrong and that's what
we've been doing so far
right
that that would that would completely
make me happy
and I wouldn't even care if CO2 was or
was not causing warming
because as long as he says the way we're
dealing with it is wrong I'm on board
the way we're dealing with it is wrong
no matter what the actual science is you
can still say that cutting off our own
energy Supply was wrong either way
and just say I'm not the scientist they
might be completely right about that but
what they're not right about is how to
manage a country
ah how about that how about how about I
won't argue with the scientists if they
don't tell me how to manage energy and
the country I'll take their input but
that's part of the input don't let your
scientists run your government
right don't let us don't let the
scientists run the government but also
don't ignore them take their input
High Ground maneuver wins every time
uh here's something that uh here's
something that Trump could do that no
other American leader could do
I want to see if I can sell this to you
I think you'll buy it immediately I
won't have to sell it all
uh General Mark Milly says and I think
Biden says this as well that we cannot
tell Ukraine what to negotiate or when
or how
that negotiations are just going to have
to be Ukraine's business now of course
we don't necessarily believe that right
we believe that I'm not done we we
believe that yeah you're ahead of me
you're so ahead of me
so
but we believe that behind the scenes of
course America has and NATO has lots of
influence
but the story is we're not going to tell
Ukraine how to do it
here's something that Trump could do
that no one else could do
you ready for this
yeah I am going to tell you how to do it
you're gonna you're gonna Crimea is
gonna stay with Russia Russia is going
to give up the stuff it took more
recently
and uh then I'll tell you what's going
to happen with NATO and then you're
going to do it in a month
he could just tell them to end
nobody else could do it
do you know why
because when Trump said look zielinski
if you don't go with this I'm cutting
you the off tomorrow
he's the only person you would believe
the only one you would believe if he
said that even if he were bluffing he's
the only person you believe
am I right he's the only person who
could just say look you we're
not going to spend a dime on this
 again
Russia
end it ended under under this deal or I
will just kill you I will just
wipe you off the map just do it
now he could do that
tell me tell me there's any other leader
who could do that
there is not
he is the one person in the world who
could just say this is done and
it's done in one month and this is what
it looks like when it's done
am I right
this is a situation where you need what
who do you need
dad
dad
yeah you said bully and then you know I
give you credit for that answer no you
need Dad
dad needs to solve this right because
you got Russians who want to solve you
got ukrainians you want assault you got
Europeans who want it solved
and you you've got ukrainians who want
to solved do you know do you know what
they're all waiting for
everybody's waiting for the same thing
do you know what it is
 leadership
[Laughter]
leadership
they're all waiting for the same thing
they all want it to end and they all
know what it looks like right
Trump is the fake because
I've told you I've taught you about a
fake because when everybody already
wants to do something or any one person
already wants to do something but they
can't they can't pull the trigger like I
kind of want to do that but
all you need is any reason
you just you just give them a reason
they go oh well okay that's a reason
all sides in this war are ready to
accept any reason to end it
they just need one
Trump is the only one smart enough that
we could give him a reason
hey Ukraine here's the reason I'm going
to cut you the off in four weeks
that's a reason
right
hey Russia
I I'm going to crash your economy in six
months
it'll take me about six months but I'm
actually gonna crash it I'm not just
going to sanction you I'm going to crash
your economy because we're done
he's the only one who could do that
there's nobody else that would be
believable
uh the first thing you should do of
course is fire in mark milley
here's my impression of General milley
when other leaders political or
otherwise talk in public
even when I disagree with them deeply
and even now when I know they're lying
even though when I know they're being
political I usually think they look
smart
you know what I mean
let's take Chuck Schumer for example I
disagree with him a lot and I think he's
lying a lot but he always looks smart
Nancy Pelosi you know political she lies
a lot but she always looks smart right
like these are smart people uh even
um
you know Eric swalwell
you know Eric swalwell does you know and
Shifty shift they're always doing things
that were mocking and laughing out but
let's let's be honest if they took an IQ
test
they do great right that they're smart
people who are doing something you don't
like Millie does not come off as smart
and I don't know what that is but I feel
like that's a necessary component of
leadership is to look smart
is it is it my
am I the only one who thinks he doesn't
even look in axmar
when he talks he acts like an idiot
does he
and it's a weird impression because I've
never had that impression from any
general
like even generals that we later found
out maybe were not so good they all
sounded really smart when they talked
they just maybe weren't right
he sounds like he's wrong and not smart
I've never seen that before have you
well like what would be one other
example of that
it's a weird thing I don't know how
we're putting up with that
all right I told you about the
Mar-A-Lago hoax has been revealed
um
and then for uh border security I think
Trump should stop saying wall wall you
know you can still build this wall it's
an important part but and I think people
are starting to agree now but I think
you should just talk about border
security more generally
don't you think
and here's the other thing the other the
other thing people are saying is that
Trump is not giving us a vision of the
future
where I just gave you some really clear
visions of the future they could give
here's something else you can say
uh imagine Trump giving a a rally
and saying you know the media says I'm
not telling you like a positive vision
of the future but I don't think you need
to be me to tell you let me do a little
test and they ask the crowd
crowd when I'm elected do you think I
want to raise taxes or lower them and
everybody would yell lower
do you want it do you think I'm going to
open the Border or secure it secure it
do you think I'm going to be soft on
crime or be tough on crime telephone
crime
he could just go that right down the
list and the and the News would have to
cover his audience shouting that they
understand completely why he would do in
office
because he has that weird advantage of
having just been in office
so so Trump can erase
every criticism against him
somewhat easily
right if you put me in Trump's body and
and just said Scott go do all the things
you just explained
Trump wins
he wins
in a landslide
he wins the landslide now Trump's worst
enemy of course is Trump
as I think we'd all agree like you know
the odds of him saying something that
gets misinterpreted or not that you know
that sets everything on a different path
that could happen
pretty likely actually
so all right so I tell you again
that I'm not supporting Trump for
president
I think I think his his age is an issue
and uh I I support only a fentanyl
plan but but if you think that uh Trump
can't can't win from this position
I think that's really wrong
I think that's really wrong
all right let's see what else has
happened
uh so as you know the midterms were
a huge disappoint from for the
Republicans because
yeah the only thing they won really
yeah just a small thing
all they won was this you know slight
majority in in the house
just enough for them to investigate the
living piss out of the Democrats
in other words
everything I wanted
[Laughter]
I don't know about you but I got
everything I wanted out of this election
I didn't I didn't miss anything
I got I got a
I got a government that's deadlocked yay
and I got a republican investigation of
the Democrats now keep in mind
you know I'd either like no no
investigations unless it's something
really big I'd like either no
investigations or let's let's do it both
ways
let's have the Democrats investigate the
hell out of the Republicans and
Republicans investigate the hell out of
the Democrats let's just make it part of
the process
you know as long as it's not stopping
the government from working
so yes uh uh in in the name of
transparency
I would certainly like to know
what what we're going to find out about
the Democrats
this is the word this is the best case
scenario
it really is for the public it's not the
best case scenario for republicans
yeah the professionals
but for us
might not be too bad it might not be
all right uh once again reports of uh
people being automatically unfollowed
from my account on Twitter how many of
you have experienced uh believing you
were following me for some time and then
suddenly you weren't
has happened to any of you
I've asked this before and I know it's
happened to a lot of you and happened to
other accounts too it's not just my
account
right now I was speculating that it
might be because some people also have
Tick Tock and when you sign on to tick
tock it asks you
for permission to post its content onto
Twitter if you say yes it gives that
Tick Tock permission not just to post
but to you know change stuff
and so in theory
Tick Tock could be changing things on
your Twitter account
like who you follow and likes and stuff
now
so I did a second poll on Twitter today
and asked how many people were having
this experience
also have tick tock because if it turned
out most people with the problem of tick
tock well you would have found the
problem turns out it's the opposite
so a very few people of having the
problem like three percent or something
actually also have tick tock so I'm
eliminating from my
probability set
that Tick Tock is the main reason that
that's happening
but that doesn't eliminate other apps
yeah you might have some other app that
was doing something with your Twitter
account and you gave it permission that
you don't remember
it's possible
so
um one of the things I'm curious about
is and I tweeted this at Elon Musk this
morning I doubt you'll see it but maybe
he's pretty busy I hear
he's sleeping at the Twitter
headquarters and working all day
um
but I asked this question if you knew
for sure
a specific user who got unfollowed from
me recently so you knew the user and you
knew me and you knew there was an
unfollow activity could you trace it
back and find the fingerprint
because you found out why in other words
could you say oh that came in from an
API command in other words any I'm sorry
I'm using some buzzwords here if you're
not all technically jargon literate uh
an API is what lots of internet
companies make available is a set of
instructions for other companies to
access their systems
so if you just wanted to tweet on behalf
of tick tock within your Twitter you
could give a permission to mess mess
with Twitter through something called an
API so that's one of the that's I would
say an API is one of those basic tech
knowledge things that even if you're
non-techy you should know what it is
because it's the thing that allows one
internet entity to or any entity on the
internet to interact with another entity
and that gives you some
abilities but also some risk
right so just know that that's the thing
all right so it's probably not to tick
tock uh by itself
unless Tick Tock did it to me
so at one point I had Tick Tock but got
rid of it I don't think they can keep
any powers after I get rid of it can
they I don't know
um so we'll find out if there's any way
to find out about that
um the Sam bankman freed story and FDX
it just gets deeper and more interesting
every day and I didn't think it was
possible
and
well so apparently he uh texted some a
journalist I think and the text of
change has been made public
and so we can see the actual you know
inner thoughts of uh Sam beckmanfried
and
uh some of the things he said is that uh
all the woke stuff was just
that everything he was doing to show
that he was like a woke guy with climate
change and everything else it was all
 it was just just to make his
company look good totally admitted it
um Eddie also said that ESG is
it was uh
perverted and distorted or something
yeah so the king of says the
ESG is
now if the king of Belgian says
something's you want to listen
to that
well I don't know if I did it in his
case I think he I think everybody in the
business world could see it
uh so he probably just saw what
everybody else saw
um
so it's just amazing it's amazing that
we got to see behind the curtain on that
so here's some LC answer I'll give you
is is verbatim
um so he was asked by whoever this
journalist type was said that you were
really good at talking about ethics for
someone who kind of saw it all as a game
with winners and losers and here's what
he said in separate little text messages
like you know he sent a bunch of them at
once the first one was yeah
he he
I had to be it's what reputations are
made of to some extent I feel bad for
those who got by it but this dumb
game we woke westerners play where we
say all the right shibboleths and so
Everyone likes us
uh you may have had to look up the word
shibboleths
but it refers to The Peculiar way that
people act
you know for some purpose
so he's saying that their wokeness is
just a peculiar way that people act
to make people like them that's pretty
much it
so the weird thing is I'm liking you
more and more and that's not supposed to
be happening like I'm not supposed to be
appreciating his honesty right now
that's that's the wrong that's the wrong
attitude
but here we are
and then because the simulation loves us
and it wanted to give us a little wink
uh a user named Beth
who I believe is
uh probably the not not the real name of
this user and I'm going to say that Beth
is very likely a second account of
somebody who's pretty powered and
somebody who kind of knows how things
work because little Beth with her cat
picture profile
uh pointed out that uh there's an
upcoming New York Times sponsored live
event and it showed four of the the main
speakers like in a little row so you can
see how good their event is here are the
speakers that they have lined up for the
event
uh there's uh Sam bankman freed bad
timing there he is next to uh zielinski
the president of Ukraine
who is next to Mark Zuckerberg who's
next to Janet Yellen the Secretary of
the Treasury and little Beth
who I don't think is Beth
and a little cat picture profile
uh tweeted that at me with just these
four words money laundering starter pack
oh
let me read the four names again
SBF you know Sam bankman freed uh
zielinski
Zuckerberg and Janet Yellen money
laundering starter back
Beth
now I hope I'm not being sexist
Beth but I don't think cat lady Beth was
on this all on her own
I think cat lady Beth might be some
high-powered Finance person or or
somebody in politics who doesn't want to
be identified online
so
anyway
um
let me call out uh I love stories of
people who are criticized for being
wrong and stupid who are later
Vindicated because every now and then
I'm in that category
remember when David sacks you know
famous internet investor type
um was talking about Ukraine and
everybody said you don't know about
Foreign Relations what do you know about
this topic
you you internet random person
why are you talking and he just got so
much and the main thing he said is
that the way Ukraine will be negotiated
inevitably will be that Crimea will stay
with Russia the the regions that Russia
took over will go back to Ukraine and
they'll work out some kind of security
guarantee or something like that
now when he said that the world just
 on him you can't tell Ukraine what
to do and stop trying to you know
influence events
as of today
totally right
totally right
yep everybody agrees Crimea is not going
anywhere uh Ukraine isn't going to
retake it
basically his his exact solution looks
like what is what is going to happen
probably
so just a shout out that the next time
David sacks tells you something
the worst take is stay in your lane
that's the worst take right it might be
a good take for somebody who's a little
underpowered you know somebody who's has
not does not have any track record of
doing anything
but it's David's sacks right
look at his resume
look at him being completely wrong and
this I'm sorry completely right in this
situation and then ask yourself if it's
a coincidence
ask yourself is that a coincidence no no
there's some people you should listen to
and he's one of them doesn't mean he'll
be right the next next time I'm just
saying he's a high credibility you know
smart person who's trying to do the best
he can for society and I really don't
think he has a political dog at any
fight I think he was just being a
patriot and he was right and it cost him
right
so big right is just expensive
all right
um Candace Owens was trending but bad
news for her is it it was trending with
her name spelled incorrectly
that kind of sucks I mean so many people
misspelled their name that are trended
wrong
but uh
she was calling out
zielinski as being a you know a fraud
and
blah blah and uh she's she's got some
good arguments there
I do not disagree with her and I I do
always appreciate
Candace Owens is one of those people
that you can disagree with and
appreciate at the same time
so now and then I'll disagree with her
but I always appreciate what what topics
she surfaces right like she'll latch on
to something that we really should be
talking about yeah we really should be
talking about is George Floyd a hero
like we really should be you know and we
really should be talking about zielinski
and we really really should be talking
about that it could be that you know her
take is wrong but we really should be
talking about that
so good for her uh another Patriot
I didn't used to like using that word
calling people Patriots it sounded so
contrived
but now I like it I don't know what
changed
um correct me if I'm wrong
I'm starting to think that everything in
the news that costs more than a billion
dollars is really a money laundering
operation
uh here's my starter list of things that
cost more than a billion dollars and at
least someone has accused them of being
really a money laundering uh thing
Afghanistan war
Ukraine
vaccines
maybe the pandemic itself FTX
and climate change
are they all money laundering
opportunities
[Laughter]
now if somebody said black lives matter
and I and I disagree with that
black lives matter is a money making
operation
right that's a money-making operation
that's not what I'm talking about I'm
talking about money laundering literally
something that looks like one thing but
money is going into it and then out the
other door into another thing that's not
black lives matter black lives matter
the money went into it and they spent it
on themselves in many cases right that's
that's a different situation so yes it's
fake
so fake Charities is another you know
category of Badness but the money
laundering you have to see that as its
own thing
right
all right
um
and related to this
as I also tweeted I don't know how much
America should spend on Ukraine I don't
know I don't think they're um as a
citizen I know enough about what's
happening behind the the scenes in
Ukraine so I don't know is one billion
enough is zero enough is zero the right
number should we just let Russia have it
I don't know I really I really don't
know genuinely
uh I don't have the information nor do
nor do any of you I don't think any of
us do but if I had all of the
information that our government has you
know the secret stuff
maybe I'd have an opinion but I know I
don't have that
but here's one opinion I do have
um the general widespread uh love of
zelenski as a hero
you didn't come by that opinion on your
own
that is an assigned opinion
yeah the the uh the propaganda machine
for Ukraine is the best I've ever seen
I've never seen anything like it and
even I believe Mark milley even said
that that their propaganda game is just
off the chart it's just like really good
and of course that's part of War right
so you wouldn't you wouldn't want them
not to do it they're in a war that's
that's a tool of course of doing it so
you know that's not a criticism that
they're using it but I want to I want to
alert you
that there could not be a more clear
case
where intelligence agencies have
assigned you this opinion about
zielinski and Ukraine
did you see how quickly people uh
lionized him in Ukraine and they're all
wonderful Heroes
that happened just sort of like just
sprung out
of nothing
yeah that that's your intelligence
agencies you know pushing the buttons
and changing the opinion in the United
States
uh Washington made clear that zero is
the right number well Eric that was
worth fifty dollars I agree you the
strongest argument is that zero was the
right number
that might not be the right answer
but it is the strongest argument
because we don't have all the
information so that's is sort of the
default if you tell me to spend 56
billion dollars without knowing what's
behind the curtain
the strongest argument is don't spend
the 56 billion or whatever it was
however many billions right would you
agree with that if you don't know what's
there
the strong argument is don't spend money
on it
so from The public's perspective that's
that is correct
um have you ever noticed this you've
probably all seen lots of images from
the war of Ukrainian military people
and did you notice that they all have
something in common
all of the pictures of the Ukrainian
military what is it what do all those
pictures have in common
especially if there are any Russian
prisoners
um they all look very big
they're unusually large human beings
they're super healthy
and they're all smiling
and they're happy to be there
and then the poor Russian soldier is
five foot seven
and he weighs 90 pounds I'm exaggerating
but you there's a difference
there's a difference
and do you think all those pictures
were like spontaneous hey wow these
ukrainians are well fed look at these
guys
do you think any of that's real
of course not don't you think the
Russian soldiers are roughly just as
happy and the same size as the
ukrainians nobody's smiling in a war
well of course there's people smiling in
the war but
yeah if it's not obvious to you that all
of those pictures are part of the
propaganda machine then you're you're
not paying attention yeah yeah that's
all a sign up
so
there's that
all right ladies and gentlemen have I
convinced you that Trump could win not
to say you will that's not a prediction
I'm just saying that there's he's got
the best path
his path there's nothing in the road
there's literally nothing in this path
he just has to do the things I explained
and he just walks down the path to the
presidency nothing would stop him
yeah now
the what are the odds he will do those
things low right
now he does his own thing
yeah
uh what about uh vaccines he he could
also he could also make us all happy on
vaccines
just say no mandate
you know what I know
right yeah you all have the same
information I have no mandates but do
what you will with that information I I
thought it was a good idea to get
vaccinated
you have the same information I do make
up your mind
I would I would
no I wouldn't do the apology
I think apology would be a mistake in
that case
because I think I think everybody early
on who is doing an honest job of trying
to make it right
they should just say that they should
say it was the fog of War we did what we
thought was the best thing to do I don't
think all of it worked
is that an apology
I did the best I could we were kind of
guessing
kind of guessing it didn't all work
I would be completely happy with that
because I don't need an apology if you
had to guess
like what were what were our
requirements of our leaders the
requirement we put on our own leaders is
do something
do something and you know doing nothing
is doing something too that's a decision
but we told them to do something when we
knew they didn't have the right
information
if you force them to do something
knowing they don't have the right
information
they don't need to apologize if
something was wrong they don't need to
apologize that was them doing exactly
what you asked them to do
that's what Trump did
Trump did exactly what we asked them to
do
his best with the information he had
that's it that's the whole story he did
his best with the information he had
didn't all work
you can decide what you think worked and
what didn't but he could easily say it
didn't all work that's how it works when
you're making decisions in a war
you don't win every battle don't get
them all right
I mean that would just That's The High
Ground
The High Ground is that's what
leadership is is making decisions
without having perfect information and
sometimes that doesn't work out at all
I would just say that directly
and just say it's not the first time
that happened it's going to happen again
that's the way it works don't think
that's not going to happen
all right
um
but after the vaccination he was still
looking sketchy because he still
defended it
again if he said I was working with the
information I had
doing the best I could our information
was not good yet
um some of it we got wrong but don't
tell you what you got wrong
because I think everybody's going to
decide on their own what was wrong and
what was right but everybody has their
own little list well this was wrong but
that wasn't so wrong right we differ in
our list of what's wrong if he starts
apologizing
there's no end to it well apologize for
the masks apologize you didn't try
harder to keep the schools open right
it'll just be all that it was much
better to say did the best I could with
the information I had
some of it didn't work
just like every country
just like every other country did the
best they could some of it didn't work
I would be a hundred percent okay with
that and by the way
I'm the only person who told you at the
beginning of the pandemic the only one
that we're asking our leaders to make
important decisions in the in the fog of
war and we better understand who
made them do that
we made them do that right and we should
know that they were going to give some
of it wrong
and we should
keep that attitude now that doesn't mean
you know there weren't some obvious
mistakes because there were
you know but it's obvious in hindsight
right everybody who everybody who had
the right answer
in the beginning
don't get too cocky
there are only two answers for
everything we did it's the right thing
to do or the wrong thing to do and there
were going to be people on both sides no
matter what no matter what right some of
them are going to get right and then say
I knew it all along and I warned you
it's just guessing at the beginning so
you know keep that in mind all right
I believe this is the best live stream
you've seen all day and I believe my
analysis of trump is the best one you
will ever see just like normal
just like usual
and uh
I don't know if you've noticed there
seems to be a horrible lack of
leadership in the world these days
and sometimes I feel like if I don't do
it it's not going to happen
I realize that's just my own illusion
but it's damn it feels that way it feels
like some days it feels like I'm
steering the ship
does anybody else ever feel that way
do any of you think that it looks
suspiciously like I'm steering the whole
ship
I see a lot of yeses on the locals
platform
I'm not going to say that that's true
but it looks like it to me too
I mean it looks like it in you know on
some topics in some ways
but you know that's what confirmation
bias gets you
right if you're inclined to believe it's
true then any evidence will support it
and since I'm inclined to think that
what I'm doing is not a waste of time
I'm sort of biased where thinking is
working
all right
uh
okay I think we've done it all did I
miss anything
any stories I missed anything that was
fun
nope
all right good best show ever see you
later YouTube and Spotify
