[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
that's not called the Super Bowl if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that only Kansas City can
understand this morning well all you
need for that is a cup or mug or a glass
a tanker chal or Stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
of the dopamine the end of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous up and it
happens now
go oh that's so
good so so
good well you may have heard there was a
thing called the Super Bowl that
happened yesterday let's talk about that
now of course many people made
predictions and uh this this time it was
a little ambiguous which prediction
would work for example you have the
following prediction
filter that the
mascots uh will determine the win so
this was a
49er versus a chief now one way to look
at it is that a chief would have a spear
49er would have a shovel spear beat
shovel so that would have predicted the
win but you it's a little ambiguous
because 49
nerves is plural so if you had a lot of
49 NES but you only had one Chief
probably the 49 NS with the shovels
could beat to death the chief so that
one was a little less obvious you know
mascot
wise but there was one filter one
prediction filter that is very
reliable and it
worked and no I don't mean the
the theory that the CIA was behind the
the
outcome I don't mean that one although
that worked it did work I'm not going to
say it didn't
work but do you know which filter it is
follow the money no no I don't know how
that works
exactly um here was the filter and I'm
surprised you missed it the best story
always wins the best
story that is so predictable
I actually think there's a reason for it
and I think that even the
49ers had some feeling in the back of
their minds that the best story was that
momes gets two in a row and a chance for
a third one which is super rare in in
sports so so F first of all Mahomes had
the better story than perie secondly of
course she had the Taylor Swift thing so
by far was the best story because you
could all I would say two weeks before
the Super Bowl I already saw a Taylor
kissing Kelsey at the end of the game
could couldn't you all see that in your
mind's eye is there anybody who didn't
imagine Kelsey and Taylor kissing at the
end of the Super Bowl because it's and
and sure enough there was a there was
image right on
schedule it it was
so I don't know it just seems like the
universe wanted that story to happen and
maybe the CIA but I'm not going to claim
that well uh Biden trolled the uh oh and
I will but I will Point let's just talk
about the uh the idea that it was all
effects did you notice that there were
at least three
situations in which if Kelsey had caught
a a touchdown pass it would have been
the end of the game I think there were
three chances that there were close
enough because Kelsey doesn't do the
long passes he does the shorter stuff
with a little run at the end and when
they would get within range of the goal
where the next the next touchdown would
win I think he had three different
chances two of them they pass to him and
he didn't quite get there but could have
uh they were trying hard so hard to make
him the hero of the game it didn't look
coincidental to me but it might have
been could have been a coincidence
didn't look
it um I will remind you that V ramaswami
made this this prediction uh over a
month ago so this is over a month ago of
a v said I wonder who's going to win the
Super bowl next month and I wonder if
there's a major presidential endorsement
coming from this artificially culturally
prop propped up couple this fall just
some wild speculation over here let's
see how it ages over the next eight
months what do you think do you think
think they're artificially propped up
and maybe the fix was in so they could
win now I'm not going to say the fix was
in but I heard a phrase from the
announcers yesterday that I've never
heard before in any kind of a game did
you hear this at one point it was just
it was just a throwaway line uh while
other things were happening and uh
Kelsey caught a pass and you heard the
announcer say I think I have this
roughly verbatim
said Kelsey was open for some reason he
was wide open for some
reason have you ever heard anybody say
that he was wide open for some
reason what would that
be and how many times was he wide
open no nobody thought to cover the guy
who was the most likely guy to cut catch
a pass in the Super Bowl nobody said you
know we should cover him a little
tightly I've got a feeling about this
Kelsey guy I think he might be Central
to some of the
outcome have you ever heard anybody say
he was open for some
reason as if as if the announcer who was
a professional couldn't figure out why
he was
open oh you've heard that okay so maybe
you watch more football than I
do it it caught my attention but I'm
seeing in the comments people say oh
that's a thing people say that but do
they say for some reason
that was the part that caught me you
could be
open all right all right you say that's
a common phrase I don't
know um however I'm going to predict the
opposite of aake I'm going to say there
will be no endorsement and the reason is
as
follows Taylor Swift would have to be
super dumb to pick a candidate and lose
30% of her
customers it would be so dumb and
everything that Taylor Swift has done
since she was what
17 has looked not just smart but maybe
unusually smart as in she seems to be
possibly even gifted in terms of
business I mean she just has seems to
have unusually good
judgment about everything except
men we'll give her that so do you think
that somebody with judgment as good as
Taylor Swift would make the huge mistake
of picking a favorite candidate I don't
think so now this is a good test of the
conspiracy theory that you know it's all
a fix if it's a fix then yes if somebody
has power over her like blackmail or
financial or something like that what
could happen I'm saying that if nobody
has any blackmail control over her she
would never do it because she's too
smart
so that's my take if it happens I'm
going to assume that somebody has
control just like they have over Biden I
assume well the so Biden did a little
uh little social media after the result
of the Super Bowl in which he showed him
with his glowing red eyes for dark dark
Biden and uh he was act he was acting he
said something like all according to
plan now I think they were mocking the
conservatives who were saying that you
know it's all some kind of a CIA
trick um but do you think that Biden was
even aware that he sent out a post on
X probably not looked like some inter
yeah had no idea and we just assume that
that's normal
now it's just normal that the president
doesn't even know who's posting on his
behalf or what it says all right I don't
know if he didn't know but I can imagine
he wouldn't meanwhile Biden instead of
doing an interview in which he might
embarrass himself by being so near death
um he decided to do a little uh recorded
piece in which he was going to complain
about companies selling you less
candy that actually happened do you
think that was somebody else's idea or
do you think that was Biden's
idea cuz that feels like Biden's idea to
me because it's so bad he's trying to
sell the American public that that
inflation they're experiencing is partly
because the Candy makers are putting
less candy in the
rapper that is the most
pathetic
disgusting weak thing I've ever seen
from a
president and I'm totally here for
it
yeah totally here for
it
anyway shrink flation he calls it I I
think that's just the dumbest weakest
thing I've seen a president do ever I've
never seen anything that pathetic that
was planned there's lots of things that
are unplanned you know like falling
downstairs but you know those seem those
are accidents this was actually
meticulously planned and executed your
candy is too small
do you know what would be better don't
eat don't eat what's in that wrapper how
about don't eat anything that you have
to take a plastic wrapper off
of you know I guess there could be some
exceptions anyway um in more important
news uh some uh scientists have
discovered that in mice the more often
the mice have an erection uh the
stronger their erections are because
every time you get an erection it's like
sort of like a muscle you know if you
exercise a muscle gets stronger so some
researchers went to work every single
day and gave my corrections to study
what the effect would be now they think
there might be some you know something
they learned about humans but I don't
know about that I feel like maybe these
just were scientists who like to uh
masturbate mice every day and get paid
for it what' you do today
Bob well I'm working on my mouse
erection study and then the obvious
question
is um do the mice have erections all the
time so that it happens on your schedule
and it's just right there when you need
it no no so how do you line up the time
you're working with the time that the
mice have the
erections how do you how do you know to
get that timing right well we you know
we we stimulate
them I have no further questions no
further questions my best guess is they
show them pictures of Minnie Mouse but
without the
clothes you ever seen Minnie Mouse
without any clothes take that little bow
end of her hair kind of hot I can see it
I can see it if I were a mouse I'd be
tged as hell all right so Jillian
Michaels
exercise um personality was on Bill
Maher's Club random and
Bill and it turns out she's more of an
economist than I'd ever imagined you
know I see her doing the exercise thing
and I think wow she knows a lot about
Fitness I didn't know that she also
knows a lot about economics so Jillian
Michaels the best economic opinion I've
ever heard came in this conversation
with Bill
Mah Bill Mah said we won the pandemic
economically and and Michael said we did
I feel like inflation is insane and Mar
says inflation is not insane and Michael
says bill go buy a car a house is
tripled here buy some
eggs and that ladies and
gentlemen is the best economic opinion
I've heard in at least a
year blah blah blah inflation blah blah
blah the money supply blah blah blah the
debt
blah blah blah economics blah blah blah
shr inflation how about screw all of
that and buy some eggs Bill I'm
could add Bill to it to be funnier I'm
just going to say that in every economic
conversation from now
on Bill somebody like blah blah blah
Good economy and I'll say go buy some
 eggs Bill and they'll just walk
away
brilliant
well you do you all remember how
terrible 2020 was you know the beginning
of the pandemic and just everything went
to hell in
2020 yeah so 2020 was a weird year um it
was a leap
year oh oh this is Leap Year too okay
well we had that one thing in common
with 2020 was a leap
year and in 2020 what else was happening
oh oh Trump was running against Biden oh
Trump was running against Biden that's
happening too but that those are two
coincidences uh let's see who was in the
Super Bowl in
2020 2020 it was the Chiefs against the
49ers and the Chiefs
won huh well that just happened uh but
back in 2020 there was a global shutdown
because of the
pandemic uh so there's nothing like that
happening at least in
2024 uh except that a man did just die
of Alaska
pox Alaska
pox I don't like the sound of that I
just stole all this from Tera Bull on
the xplatform she made these these
observations that 2020 and 2024 are
looking suspiciously similar now can we
use the Super Bowl prediction method let
me ask you which is the better story
in 2020 what was the better story Trump
winning or Trump
losing what was the better
story Trump winning and he
won in
2022 um I'm
sorry yeah um I got all my years backed
up in
2016 Trump winning was the better story
2016 sorry I got the dates wrong have I
ever mentioned I don't know if I've ever
mentioned this I have a calendar issue
has anybody heard me say that
before like even today I published the
wrong comic
again like I always do I'll tell you
today's a tough day for
dyslexics so the date today is
concentrate
21224 do you know how hard that is for a
dyslexic that takes some concentration
to write that date down that's a tough
one yeah my my dyslexics can you confirm
that's a tough one yeah anyway uh back
to my point 2016 the better story was
Trump winning but in
2020 was the better story that Trump
wins
reelection because that's not much of a
story is it that would be sort of the
normal somebody wins
re-election but you know it would be a
better story a really good story is if
Biden won that election in a way that
many people thought was suspicious in
terms of the regularity of the
election and then in
2024 he comes
back you tell me that's not the better
story the better Story by far is that
Trump comes back and wins in
2024 by far do you think there's any
chance that's not the best story now I'm
not saying it's best for the country
you're that's separate but as a
story you can't beat it and if you add
to that that there might be some extras
such as beating all the lawfare that's a
good
story and what
if the the last election is shown to be
let's say less credible than we thought
it was what if that happened
right yeah by ammo all right um rasmuson
did a poll to find out who's the most
respected leader of our various recent
presidents and
42% of likely voters said they respect
Trump the
most well uh can you guess roughly what
percentage said they had the most
respect for Joe Biden President Joe
Biden you want to take a guess anybody
oh very good yeah you're very close
21% that's right you could not even get
up all the way to the 25%
level for Joe Biden only 21% say he's
the most
respected now most of that difference is
because Trump has a lot of respect among
Republicans but Democrats are kind of
looking at Biden and saying H we might
like him better but you know not not a
super bunch of
respect H I wonder what would cause you
to have less respect for Biden well a
related story is that Biden has gone on
Tik Tock with
Harris that's
right the the politician who is
sometimes accused of being influenced by
China because of hunters um taking money
from a big Chinese
company they've just joined the Tik Tock
uh platform also known as the Chinese
brainwashing
platform and it's also true at the same
time that Biden has banned Tik Tock from
government PL uh government
devices so he's smart enough to ban
it and also dumb enough to use
it now of course he's using it because
he thinks it'll give him an election
Advantage with younger people especially
and it might might actually be useful
but how much do you respect a President
Who bans something because it's so
obviously bad and then becomes its most
important
user how could you respect
that I have zero respect for that I
can't respect that at
all uh V is on it too but at least V's V
never banned it it it's different if
you've literally banned it for
government and then you use it right if
a vag banned it and then used it I'd
have the same
questions all right uh
meanwhile uh I I'm going to say this
again because it's it's just so smart
Trump called for an end to all foreign
aid unless it's a loan and it could be
zero interest and maybe you don't have
to pay it back right away but you do owe
us and I like that because even in a
situation where you're not actively
making loans to people you can still say
you owe us you know you owe us one later
it's just the most
obvious smart
play so that makes sense to
me CBS has some fake news about climate
uh says uh basically the air quality is
terrible for a lot of people in the
United States especially and it's
because of climate change the air
quality is bad because of climate change
and the first example they give is those
forest fires in Canada from was it last
year or two years ago the forest fires
in
Canada now can you give me a news update
fact check don't we know that those were
all set by an arsonist who's already
admitted it and is in the legal system
in
Canada I thought that was completely
confirmed news and it's the number one
example they give of how climate change
climate change is making the air dirty
now it's not about these people lighting
fires it's about climate change and CBS
says that with no sense of
embarrassment
wow uh Mark Mark lvin is talking about
the her report you know the report that
said that Biden was not going to be
prosecuted but uh that he had you know
some kind of memory problems let's say
but here's how markk Levin characterizes
that in the post he says the
indisputable evidence in the special
council's report shows that Biden has
been violating the Espionage Act for
half a century for which Garland the
Attorney General will not prosecute him
is that a fair
statement that the report proved he's
been violating that law for half a
century and he will not be prosecuted
for it that is
accurate at the same time
at the same
time like literally the same time I'm
reading this reading this from Lin and
then the next thing I read is that Trump
is appearing for this hearings on his
his uh his
documents the the same thing except you
know something he did once there were a
lot of them but something he did
once so yes I am aware that the
Democrats are saying the real issue is
the resistance to giving them back and
here's what I say to that that's a good
point it's a good point that the bigger
issue is is resistance and giving them
back but here's my better point to your
better Point Define
resistance Define resistance if the
lawyers were no longer taking phone
calls well that's
resistance
right if if the government said we're
going to come in and break the lock and
take them from you and if they
physically restrained them from doing it
well that would be resistance no doubt
about it but what if the government's
demanding them and the lawyers are
saying stuff like well we think we gave
you all of it but maybe they're wrong
and uh we're still talking to you and we
think we should keep these and does that
sound like you're obstructing justice or
does that sound like every every
defendant in every situation who's
aggressive they're just doing everything
they can to fight what they don't
like I don't know I guess the courts are
going to figure that out but to uh to me
as a citizen it looks like uh the laws
are not being equally
applied there it's not exactly the same
situation I get that but the feeling of
it is that the laws are not being
equally
applied
um so here's my
take after watching uh Joe Biden not
being able to do an interview in the
Super Bowl because he's too degraded I
think we all agree that's the only
reason he wouldn't do it and then
instead he does his little dumb
commercial about the size of candy and
how the candy got
smaller that's a level of patheticness
that I would normally say um you need to
stop this right
away right I would say okay this is sad
politics aside you know I'm not being
political now this is a human individual
that you're torturing and you're you're
just destroying his legacy by making him
continue where whereas leaving
gracefully might actually put him in a
good position for history but he's not
in a good position for history
now however the more I thought about it
the more I thought that Joe Biden is not
your normal president for one thing he
got elected on the fine people hes which
literally hurts
me it hurts me and it's said anybody
who's white and anybody who's ever
supported Trump because it's the biggest
hoax in the country that wasn't the
Russia collusion hoax and wasn't the
January 6 Insurrection hoax but between
the fine people hoax and the January 6
Insurrection hoax and the other things
he said about Mega and the locking up of
Americans over just protests he is the
most evil person I've ever seen
in politics in the United States I think
McCarthy was bad you know McCarthyism
but I think he took it to another level
I don't think Nixon can't had anything I
mean Nixon was just maybe did some bad
things but it didn't hurt me personally
but Biden has gone after the people he's
gone after the public the fine people
hoax is an attack on
me it's attack on 81 million people who
supported Trump and the January 6
Insurrection hoax is Attack on Americans
there there's nothing there's no other
way to say it he's locking up Americans
to support a hoax for purely political
reasons now he's trying to put Trump in
jail for you know using lawfare to put
Trump in jail and he and he's certainly
the approximate cause of the Ukraine war
how many hundreds of thousands of people
died unnecessarily because Trump wasn't
President we assume a lot he is the most
evil
president I think in history I don't
think anybody's even close and I don't
think that words like incompetent and
dementia that doesn't cover it because
he did a lot of this stuff when he was
still capable enough that nobody was
going to 25th amendment him right and
I've actually completely changed my
opinion about uh watching him die in
front of
me because when I watch him on TV I'm
watching a man
die what you see it right you're seeing
somebody on his last
legs and he shouldn't even be standing
most of the
time and I used to think this is really
bad this is not good for the country but
when I see the most evil politician I've
ever seen who isn't named Adam Schiff um
literally suffering and dying in front
of me I'm actually enjoying it and I'm
just admitting that if if I could watch
Hitler being tortured to death I'd
probably do it I don't think I'd turn it
off I'd probably watch it if if you're
going to see uh Bin Laden shot in the
face if there had been a body cam of the
actual killing of him I'd watch
it I I mean I don't think there's
anything cool about somebody getting
getting shot in the face but Bin Laden I
would actually watch with
pleasure as like his skull was blown off
from the back and then if there would be
a picture of him with like a big hole in
his head laying there in the floor I'd
be let's Replay that yeah I'd put that
at a loop because killing a monster is
not like killing a
person right you just feel completely
different about it and while I I don't
want anything violent of course to
happen to any president including Biden
watching his allies torture him to death
in front of me by putting him on TV I'm
actually starting to enjoy it and I
don't want to see him replaced I I want
to see them torture him every
day for the rest of his life and I want
him to look pathetic I want him to
embarrass his enti entire team that's
doing this to him and I want them to run
him into the ground the way he's done to
to
me so him yes I want to see him die
in public not not by any actions of
anybody you know not nothing violent of
course but I want to watch the Democrats
drag his lifeless body onto the stage
and watch him breathe his last words
because he's evil and watching
him die is enjoyable just like Hitler
just like bin Laden and just like any
other common murderer and piece of
right to to treat him like a regular
politician when he's played the fine
people hoax in the January 6 hoax and of
course was complicit in the Russia
collusion hoax he is no friend to the
Republic he's a criminal and a
evil bastard of which we have never seen
anything like it there's no nothing
comparable to this in any experience in
America
so 86% of people PED in recent polls say
Biden is too
old uh Jonathan Turley puts that in
context he says uh that to compare that
only 82% of the public agrees that the
Earth is
round so there are more people who can
understand that Biden is too old than
there are Americans who believe the
Earth is
round
but to be perfectly uh accurate the
world is not
round it is not it's not flat as far as
I can tell it's a little bit ooid yeah
it's a little bit
ooid that's the way we roll on this
podcast the nerdier the better it's a
little
ooid while speaking of the fine people
Oaks publish of the peace and American
greatness talking about uh Biden resur
it and
um how ridiculous it is and he he
debunks it thoroughly as he
has me and Joel poock as
his the other two Horsemen trying to
kill this thing for several
years but he tells a story that I think
I half knew but I didn't know it totally
and you just have to hear
this now I've said this before that one
of the things CNN likes to do is they'll
bring on somebody they they think is
uh let's say representing the political
opinion of the
Republicans but they have a they have a
habit of not bringing on the strongest
person in other words CNN is not going
to make an offer to vake if you if he
doesn't go further in politics they're
not going to make an offer to him to be
on CNN because he'd be too
good all right when you calm down about
the 34 Minute glitch maybe we can carry
on
if I know that's very exciting to all of
you we still don't know why I had 34
minutes my podcast glitches at least on
the locals sometimes on the other
platforms as
well looks like it glitched
everywhere
yeah
anyway so back to what I was talking
about here's a story from Steve Cortez
so he was so I said that CNN usually
hires a week
Republicans to defend Republicans so it
looks like the bad point of view but
when they got Steve Cortez they made a
strategic mistake because he was by far
too strong and he would debunk their
hoaxes right in front of them now what
do you think happens when you hire
somebody for CNN and he goes on the air
and starts debunking their own
news he didn't just give them opinions
he
well they fired him but they didn't fire
him fire him as in stop paying him it
was better than that they paid him and
didn't put him on the air because his
contract kept him off of other
media that's right they paid to keep him
off the air because he was debunking the
fine people hoax and doing such a good
job of it he did a prageru video uh and
you know video is going to be a little
more viral than text and it just
completely demolished The hoax so he got
not fired but basically hidden for pay
by CNN and then listen to
this um so uh there's a media reporter
called Oliver Darcy on CNN now I've
often pointed him out he's like one of
the three Horsemen at CNN who will say
the most ridiculous things so the most
ridiculous things you'll hear Steve
darcon will be one of the three people
who said it usually so here's what he
said so he uh quote this is according to
Steve that Oliver Darcy castigated his
work on the old Twitter posting quote
calling this a malicious lie which is
not so in other words Darcy is saying
that the find people Oaks is a real
thing calling it a malicious lie which
is not and journalistic M feance which
it's also not is a weird thing for
someone who is a paid CNN commentator to
say given the Network's accurate
reporting on the
matter you remember CNN's accurate
reporting on the
matter yeah I don't they still don't
report it accurately and it is the most
debunked hes of all time because it's
right there in the transcript there's
nothing to there's really nothing to
argue once you read the transcript
um so Ju Just think about the fact that
Oliver Darcy in
public believes he either believes the
hoax or he's pushing the hoax there's no
way to know what he's thinking
internally do you think he believes it
do you think that Darcy is fooled by
CNN's own
reporting or do you think he's lying and
he knows he's
lying I don't know I can't
tell you think so I'm looking at the
comments a lot a lot of you think he
knows he's lying and he's doing I don't
know the the way he's saying it suggests
you might believe
it like he actually believes his own
network
reporting which would be weird I don't
know how you could work there and
believe the reporting I mean you see it
right up front you're if you're in the
front row how could you believe it's
true I don't know so Hillary is pushing
the new hoax um I'm going to call it the
uh the NATO the NATO funding hoax no
just let's call it the NATO hoax but you
could also call it the summer
hoax so if you're going to hashtag it
summer hoax or NATO hoax and and here's
what Hillary Clinton
says in a post on X today or yesterday
she said Trump sells out our NATO allies
to Putin now what she's talking about is
the story where Trump said that if NATO
if a NATO country didn't pay their dues
that he told them they wouldn't protect
them if Russia attacked
them now everybody with even the
slightest bit of Common Sense knows that
first of all you would make the decision
individually you're not going to say in
advance you wouldn't protect them you
you would never announce it obviously so
that's not serious but it is serious way
to negotiate if you don't pay your bill
you're not going to get the the service
and the service is protecting you now so
of course he would protect American
interests and American interest probably
would be served by you know uh playing
along with NATO if a NATO country got
attacked but he's being
smart by saying no you don't get a free
lunch if we're going to protect you and
you don't have to pay why would you pay
why would they pay it wouldn't make any
sense they could get it for
free so um so Hillary's trying to twist
this as as her um you know trained
monkeys in the Press are trying to twist
it
into uh Trump's trying to kill NATO
that's right Trump the person who got
the most funding of all time for NATO
she's trying to sell you the hoax that
he wants to kill
it nobody's done more for NATO than
Trump
um he I think he has asked you know
about if that makes sense in the future
which is a perfectly good
question all right so she says uh the
Trump sells out our NATO alleys to Putin
and then she said and here's the
chilling part quote this should be front
page news of every paper in the country
these are the stakes of
2024 correct me if I'm wrong but she's
literally telling her
her winged monkey press how to report
the story she's telling them that the
hoax should be their main
story The the person who as far as we
know organized the fine people hoax and
made sure it was on the front page of
everything the woman who is certainly
behind at least pushing it the fine
people hoax she's telling you a third
time that the third hoax should be the
headline
and then the AP
reports basically the AP reported the
same
thing so it looks to me like Hillary
just sounded the alarm not alarm but you
know sounded the the bad signal this is
the hoax we're going to focus on for the
summer
now how many of you like me I said it in
public I said it a whole bunch of times
there's going to be a big summer
hoax now there might be another one but
they they like to have one really solid
one to last all summer because the
summer is a slow news time so you have
to replace the slow news that nobody
cares about with an exciting hoax
because it gives the news something to
talk about yeah like a George Floyd Etc
right there's always a summer hoax so
this one might have this might have
happened too soon I don't know if they
can push it all summer there might be
another one coming but once you see the
The hoax um framework and how the
Democrats use the hoax as primarily
their campaign strategy their campaign
strategy is literally
hoaxes now compare that
to um
Trump trump says the Border needs to be
protected
better is that a
hoax yeah Trump says he could have uh
ended the war in Ukraine in a day or it
could is that a
Hox because it looks real to
me right I there's a big difference
between the party that's just making
promises and maybe they can do it maybe
they can't you know there there's some
promises they'll make like fenel that
maybe nothing happens but they certainly
aren't hoaxes there's certainly things
that you see Trump attempting to fix at
the very
least
all right so meanwhile the court has
ordered Elon mus to testify in a sec
inquiry over the acquisition of
Twitter so this is exactly what it looks
like it's lawfare against somebody who's
protecting Free Speech the last Bastion
of free speech and so the government is
trying to take him out it's exactly what
it looks like yeah the Biden
Administration is trying to take out an
American citizen for the crime of free
speech and making everybody have
it that's actually happening do you know
it should be the front page of every
newspaper that Biden is trying to end
Free Speech as we know it and here's one
example the Elon mus thing here's
another example January 6 here's another
example everybody who got kicked off um
the news for saying things were
true the story is the complete end of
free speech in my opinion free speech is
literally gone everywhere except on X
and even then you're going to get fired
if you you know if you have a boss
you're still going to get fired if you
say something they don't
like so I I asked the question
provocatively a few days ago at what
point do we say we should not teach
children that America has free speech
because I think it's now I feel like
you'd just be lying to children and if
you say you know in America we've got
free speech and it's one of our
advantages that's actually not true we
do not have free speech in a way we've
understood it for you know decades and
centuries what we have now is absolutely
not free speech I don't know what it is
but it's not free
speech all right so it's about time we
uh teach the kids
that um while the Super Bowl was going
on Israel moved into Rafa which is in
the southern part of Gaza so I guess
nobody said this directly but I'm
reading between the lines does this mean
that the north is already done I mean
done in terms of you know obviously
there's infinite cleanup and sweep up
and still people in tunnels but have
they
largely conquer the north of Gaza the
IDF because I'm hearing they're going
into the South
and they're even saying that the people
in the South uh their only option I
think is to move to the north where it's
already
destroyed that's their only option right
there's no place else to go so they they
gave the notice for the Rafa people to
evacuate um and I guess the only place
they could go is to the destroyed North
which means that they're destroying less
of the north now so did they actually
win I mean in the north I don't know
what's going on on there so there
there's a little mystery going
on but apparently Rafa is the big city
that a lot of people thought they would
never go into but Netanyahu is saying um
yes we are going in there total Victory
so now you understand the total
Victory slogan
right so Netanyahu is saying total
Victory and it's very clarifying because
if you thought they weren't going into
um into Rafa then you didn't understand
what total means total Victory like
every single Hamas person will be jailed
or killed every one of them that you
know the
fighters
so um there's a story that uh Biden is
mad at Netanyahu and behind the scenes
called them a-hole so NBC is reporting
that NBC is reporting it now
remember if if all you know is what the
news is you don't know anything you have
to know who the players are to know
something and this is NBC reporting a
anonymous
source the least credible reporting from
the least credible entity right NBC
would be the least credible entity
because they're the the smart people
tell me they're fully owned by the
CIA so why would they go after Biden spe
specifically on this point about Nan
yahu is it because they don't want Nan
yahu to go into Rafa or they're trying
to tank the relationship between
Netanyahu and Biden or they trying to
make sure Biden doesn't get reelected
because I think Nan yahu is not so
popular that saying a bad thing about
him would hurt you
necessarily all right well we don't know
that but I wouldn't believe that a story
if we're going to be be consistent and I
like to do
that if we had heard this story about
Trump would you believe
it if you heard an anonymous source
reported only by NBC said that Trump had
said a bad thing about another world
leader would you believe it I hope not
that would be the lowest level of
credibility so when it happens to
Biden do you believe it you should not
doesn't mean it didn't happen
I don't know if it happened or not but
you should put it on this the lowest
level of credibility an embarrassingly
low level like really embarrassing let
low but does he does Biden uh is he
pleased with Netanyahu I don't think so
because they do have a different opinion
about the ceasefire and that's a pretty
big topic so I don't think he's happy
with him but did he call him an a-hole I
don't know I wouldn't I wouldn't bet my
life on
it all right here's the funniest tragic
news I've heard in a while uh the Jewish
news Syndicate I don't know who they are
but they're reporting that there's a
split in Hamas leadership and that some
senior officials realized that the
terror group will not remain in Gaza
after the
war wait
what according to this there were
members of Hamas who believed that Hamas
would still remain in Gaza after the
war ser
iously have they not been listening to
anything do they have not they have no
no access to
news let me let me explain what total
means total
Victory total victory means every one of
you will be dead including the leader
100% guaranteed every one of you will be
dead or in jail I suppose right
so but Hamas is still acting as if maybe
they'll still be in power after the war
is over do they really not know that
that option is completely
gone it's
weird Hamas
noas noas noas Hamas no let me uh if
Hamas is listening and I'm pretty sure
Hamas Tunes in every day to listen to my
podcast because they're so fascinating
and
entertaining but if you're listening
Hamas let me explain what the word total
means
total total it means all like every bit
nothing left over no crumbs left over
all of it all of it so now there won't
be any Hamas left in
Gaza they will be all gone 100% every
single one is that clear
enough all right um you're probably
wondering and I know it's taken me a
long time but so many people are asking
so I guess I have to do it Scott how
would you make peace in the Middle East
all right all right if if it's G to come
to me I'm G to do it right I was I was
thinking that maybe some of you could
handle this you I was saying there are
eight billion people in the world does
it always have to fall to
me to solve solve everything but okay
okay so let me give you my solution for
the Palestinian situation the uh what we
call the one state solution or the two-
State solution are you ready number one
make the make Jerusalem the capital for
both the Israelis and the
Palestinians I'm just waiting for the
reaction make Jerusalem the capital for
both oh there we go there's the nose oh
you haven't heard the whole plan did you
think that was it you didn't think there
was a trick come on how long have you
been listening to me you don't think
there's a second shoe that's going to
drop you don't think I've got a a clever
way to frame this all right here it
comes you make Jerusalem the capital for
both Israel and the Palestinians
but it has to be remote Workforce you
can't actually go there so any body can
go there except the government the
government cannot go there to work they
can go there to visit no nobody would be
prevented so the government of both
could visit as much as they want but
they wouldn't be allowed to have a
building there they wouldn't be allowed
to have a
building or or if the if they have a
building it's just a server farm and
they just work
remotely now what happens if the uh
Palestinians and the
Israeli Israelis want to meet with each
other which seems like a good idea you
know where it would be a good place to
do
that
Jerusalem maybe the only thing you
should do there politically is when
those two sides are meeting maybe it's
the only thing now I know what you're
saying but Scott Scott you know it's
Israel's land blah blah blah it's still
their land they would still have total
military police control it would still
be you know on their map it's just that
you would
say uh all the politicians are working
on zoom and nobody's going to be there
physically but it's both of your
capitals and if you want to meet
together we've got this one facility
that you both own and that's where the
meetings will be if you need to beat
together all right so that's the first
part I'm just getting
started the second part is you you say
to the Palestinian
um so you say you would like to uh you
know take over Israel and get your get
what you would say is your land back now
Israel would say it's their ancestral
home and you know they have it fair and
square but you recognize there's a
difference of opinion so suppose you
said let's talk about this issue and I'd
like to make you an offer uh here's the
offer and let's say you're Israel here's
the offer uh what is it about Jerusalem
I'm sorry what is it about Israel that
you want and they'd say everything like
it was ours that's what they would say
right the Palestinians who were
displaced in
1948 uh when their kids they say we want
it all so you say Well define all let
let's break it down uh we'll go back to
Total What's the total so number one is
it about the
location it's something about the
location right because it's like holy
and they say yes obviously the location
it's the holy place the location
obviously so then you say well from a
god point of view since God is the one
who is important to the question of what
location Who belongs in it's sort of a
god point of view do you think God
doesn't understand how location works
because location doesn't work the way
you think it does from a god perspective
who can see the entire universe and all
the planet
the position of that Holy Land is
somewhere back in empty space because
position is only relevant to other
objects and the other objects on Earth
are just some of the objects most of the
objects in the world are in or in the
universe or elsewhere so there is no
such thing from a God's perspective
there's no such thing as a
location because the the location of
tomorrow just doesn't exist I mean the
location of yesterday doesn't
exist so then Hamas says all right
you're being too cute that's too cute
you know what we mean and then I say
what do you
mean um I've got an idea if it's the
location that matters and you guys are
really good at building tunnels how
about this the Israelis will have above
ground because they've got that stuff
there it's already built and uh we'll
give the Palestinians as much as they
want
underground so if you're a mile let's
say you have to be at least a mile down
but you can have as much as you could
have the whole thing the Israelis will
own nothing underground you know unless
there's oil there or something um and
you can have as much as you want total
total location you got it and then
they're going to say
Scott we didn't have underground
before we were above ground so we're not
going to settle SLE for
tunnels right we're not going to settle
for tunnels and then I'd say okay so
you're admitting it's not the location
that's the important
part that's just all we were trying to
accomplish so you're saying the location
first of all doesn't exist logically
from a god perspective because all the
planets have moved since then and
secondly you're saying that even if we
gave you the
location in in the way that you've
actually been maximizing location
recently in Gaza underground you're
saying that's not good enough so it's
not the location by itself there's more
to it they say yes it's you know the the
physical place that you know our
ancestors walked like above ground and
then you
say how much of the top soil would you
need to be happy that that was your
ancestral place and then they say what
say yeah suppose we take the top foot of
top soil you know to get down as far as
certainly existed in in ancient times
you know we'll go down like 3,000 years
which might be a foot two feet I don't
know and we'll uh you can have as much
as you want if you want to build your
house somewhere else we'll find a place
in Israel that's got some extra dirt
we'll just scrape off enough for your
house and then you can have Holy Land
dirt and literally build it on the same
dirt that your ancestors walked on so
you'll also get land you know because
the West Bank has extra
land extra doesn't mean nobody owns it
but you know what I mean there's space
and so you can get the
dirt and you can get the
location you can get the
sun because you're you know on the dirt
outside if you like and you would agree
that location doesn't mean much in terms
of God so you can have the dirt the
location and then they say but what
about the
money like we lost everything you know
when we left you know we would have
owned a house we would have owned
property and that'd be worth something
here's what I would do if they would
accept all the other terms and if Israel
wanted to pay some kind of reparations
just to put a you know put a tag in this
thing
forever they should do it with stock
they should issue stock in the the index
of Israeli
companies
and here's why because you want the
Palestinians not just to be satisfied
that something happened that you know
gave them some peace but that they're
bought into Israel's uh continued
economic
existence if you gave somebody $5,000 in
stock in the isra
um
economy would they want to throw away
$5,000 and say no we we hate this dirty
Jew stock we don't want any of your and
you say I thought you wanted
reparations I can't think of a better
reparation in the stock because it it
will keep going
up the only thing that would be required
for is Israel's stock to go up is
what let me say it to you in a better
way
are you ready here's the payoff it's
coming have you seen the iselia stock
market
today I think it's at an all-time
high do you know
why because they're unambiguously
winning in
Gaza
unambiguously what would the stock
market look like in
Israel if they made a deal with the
Palestinians that the Palestinian is
actually
accepted what would that do to the stock
market 20 to
50% I mean it would change the the
future of Israel
forever so it's the sort of thing where
if you gave people
stock they would they would have a
financial incentive that would be
real and it could double if they just
decide to do a little piece it could
double and $10,000 probably means a lot
to a lot of people especially if it's
you know every family member or
something like that now you might say to
yourself Scott Israel can't afford
that to which I say don't the
Palestinians have friends like tons of
people who would like to help them out
have them help them out by buying stock
that is then gifted to the Palestinians
then everybody
wins uh Islam wants to own the planet
somebody says oh I get it I get it yeah
I I do understand that there's a
religious imperative but you can cleave
that
out uh at least for the holy lands just
by making location look stupid as an
idea yeah now anybody who doesn't accept
that idea probably has to
be dealt
with all right so um that is my plan and
now would that work of course not of
course not because the personalities are
such that it wouldn't matter if it was a
good offer or a bad offer it only
matters that they're enemies and they
want to stay that way apparently so I
don't think it'd work but wouldn't it be
interesting to have it out
there wouldn't it be interesting to just
have it out there because then you'd say
look I've got a plan now here's the
hardest part here's the real payoff two
states solution or one how do you solve
that how in the world do you solve when
there's some people who absolutely are
never going to give up on the two-state
solution well at the at the other hand
there are people who absolutely won't
give up on one state solution so how do
you solve it
easily easily you create two
states they really one in all the
important
ways that's it you just create two
states
that are really just one in all the
important
ways now how do you do that a variety of
ways for example you could say Israel is
going to do the security
concerns and they're going to do the
conser the uh security and that includes
the school
curriculums because it's a it is
literally a existential threat to Israel
if the schools in the West Bank are
teaching them to kill kill Jews right
it's an existential um Homeland threat
to
them so let's say Israel controls the
security but hold
on what if they offer that the
Palestinians don't have to pay for any
of
it now you've got now you've got a
country ish it's not a full country
because it doesn't have their own
military and insecurity but that's being
handled for them if the Palestinians
were smart they'd say wait a minute did
we just get a country that doesn't even
need to pay for military or school or uh
or
police do you know what kind of a
economic advantage that would be if you
didn't have to pay for your own
security that's huge and let's say that
they now own stock and let's say that
there's enough peace that the Israelis
feel confident investing more in the
West Bank and we find ways to work
together so that they're enough
employees for
everything there is actually a two-state
solution that's really one state that's
really one state acting like two states
is basically the Taiwan
solution right the reason we don't have
a war in Taiwan is that we agree to
pretend it's all part of China but not
really
right now if you'd never seen the Taiwan
thing work it actually works I mean so
far um you wouldn't think that you could
do something as stupid as saying that
you know two countries are really one
country but you absolutely could do
something as stupid as saying two
countries are really one country of
course you could you could sell anything
it just has to be in the best interest
of all the people involved why is it
that everybody agrees with the Taiwan
situation which is clearly absurd that
it's two countries in one country at the
same time why does everybody agree with
that because it's in everybody's best
interest that's it we we just like close
our eyes and say okay I don't want to
fight over this so all right it's just
all
China and China doesn't want to have a
war over it so they say all right you
can treat it like it's a separate
country as long as you say it's China
right so we've agreed to live in
absurdity because it just happened to be
in everybody's best interest now you are
correct in pointing out that in China
you don't have the religious Dimension
I'm seeing that in the
comments the religious Dimension makes
everything not work however I do think
you have a
obligation to offer a solution you
should at least make people have to
struggle with why the Practical solution
isn't available to them if you never do
it it'll just always be this way but
over time maybe you could convince
people that a practical approach to the
their own best interest could be
achieved in which it doesn't require
them to kill each other it would take a
while but I think you could sell the
idea that there's a way to live in peace
and both have their separate lives and
stuff so that ladies and gentlemen is my
idea
for
um solving the Middle East perfectly
impractical but that's how you start
just like the Taiwan situation absurd
impractical no way it's going to work
but you got to start chipping at it you
got to start chipping
away
yeah um so there all right that ladies
and gentlemen is the uh conclusion of my
insanely great show that you're so happy
to have seen thanks for uh joining on
the xplatform and on YouTube and on
Rumble you're all awesome and I will see
you tomorrow assuming we're all still
here bye for now thanks for
joining
