hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
it's time yes
for coffee with scott adams and the
simultaneous sip which some of you hate
some of you love some of you need it
and all you need is a copper bunker
glass a tanker challenger steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
except the kraken
it's called the simultaneous up and it
happens now go
i can feel the kraken getting stronger
every minute
well we'll talk about the kraken but
let's get to important things first
the most important thing on my schedule
december 16th the sci-fi show the
expanse
comes out with its next season now
if you're a nerd like i am that's pretty
exciting
pretty exciting so look for the expanse
if you haven't watched that there are
several seasons already
you can catch up carly fiorini
fiorina made some news with this tweet
she said inadequate men in big jobs
are always dangerous president trump has
cemented his
legacy as an inadequate man who lacks
the mental faculties and strength of
character
necessary for the job how many others
will prove
by saying and doing nothing that they
too
are inadequate i feel as though
carly this is first of all a
sexist comment because it does seem like
you're focusing on the man part of this
a little too much if you know what i
mean because it could have said
inadequate people in big jobs
can do bad things wouldn't that be fair
somebody could say inadequate people
but if you say inadequate men
in big jobs it feels like a comment
about men doesn't it
doesn't it feel a little bit and you
know that you could not have said this
with the genders reversed obviously you
could not say
inadequate women in big jobs
imagine tweeting that imagine using the
phrase
inadequate women in big jobs
it would be the end of your career would
it not i mean
quite legitimately that would be the end
of your professional career if you ever
tweeted something like that
but she can do that but she doesn't
limit it to the president where you
allow that people are going to be a
little bit more hyperbolic
but rather she extends it to
how many others others
who are the others will prove
by saying and doing nothing that they
too are inadequate
i feel as if she's talking about me
because as a trump supporter would i be
in this category of
men who are proving themselves
inadequate
by not doing enough
well or carly fiorina i don't know what
is adequate and what is enough
but you are a despicable
and i think you should disappear forever
from the public now i use that c
word cautiously she earned it
come on women admit it she earned
it she earned it all right
i wouldn't use that word for anybody
else but i think she just she moved
herself into a special
category where i think that word just
sort of fits in this case she's a
despicable human being
there's an important news conference
coming up president says
at 12 eastern in which the
rnc lawyers will be
showing their very clear and viable path
to victory
very clear and viable path to victory
what do you think will it be persuasive
we will talk about some of the things
we'll get to that uh jim cramer
on cnbc made some news referring to
the two white houses so uh
as you know i made the most unusual
prediction about this race
once we got closer to the election
itself i started saying
it looks like we're going to have two
presidents jim cramer's making the same
observation now
that we'll have two white houses um you
know
in in the conceptual sense but then he
went further and said that he thinks
that if it comes to it
and yet you know when trump decides not
to leave
uh jim cramer believes that the u.s army
would take biden's side
what do you think if the u.s army got
involved
would they take biden's side
well i'm going to say they won't get
involved
at all i don't think that they will get
involved
at all somebody says you love yourself
good grief don't you
i don't understand the comment should we
not be loving ourselves
why don't you love yourself is there
something wrong with you
that you don't love yourself
all right do you ever wake up and you're
feeling a little too aggressive
and you think to yourself i better watch
it today
because i feel like like i just woke up
feeling aggressive and uh
if i don't take care of that i you know
i have to exercise or something
i got to take down my uh take down the
temperature a little bit
but here's my belief i don't think
there's any chance the u.s army
military will be involved in the white
house
decision don't think they will get
involved
but if they did if you're treating it as
a hypothetical
i think they would go with the consensus
meaning that if it looked like the the
process
had elected biden they would probably
back him but i don't think they'll get
involved i don't think you have to worry
about that
let's talk about some of the pieces of
evidence
gateway pundit is talking about
something they call the drop and roll
before i talk about any of these a
legend
claims about election fraud
i let me remind you that my general
framework for this is that there's a 95
percent
chance that any individual claim of
fraud is
just bs all right so as i as i speak to
each of these individual claims
just know that in my head i'm saying
that there's a 95
chance that's not true but i do believe
and i'll talk about this later that the
election
had some fraud we don't know how much
yet
so the drop and roll as the gateway
panda is calling it
goes like this they drop a big bunch of
uh votes that are presumed
fraudulent and then once it changes
who's ahead
so it's the big drop puts biden in
ahead and then all of the uh the
allegation is that that's the drop and
then the role part
is that all the uh the precincts that
haven't yet reported
come in at the same ratio in other words
they're
they're the coincidence that a whole
bunch of
uh different precincts would have
exactly the same
split is so unlikely that it couldn't
happen naturally
now the counter to that is that the
gateway pundit is looking at the wrong
column and that the column they're
looking at
is the cumula cumulative
percentages and after the big drop
which changes the percentages the little
precincts that come in
afterwards even though they might be a
little bit different
they're not big enough to change the
overall
cumulative percentage so if you're
looking at the cumulative percentage not
changing
you could say well that's the biggest
coincidence in the world how could the
average not change
as you're continually adding data it
would fluctuate wouldn't it
i mean you'd think but it doesn't
but the encounter argument is that it's
because you're looking at the cumulative
which doesn't fluctuate that much
if you're only adding small amounts to
it
do you think that the claim is stronger
than the debunk
this one i would say i don't have an
opinion on except for my general claim
that 95 of all things will turn out to
be false
about the election so but
uh i don't know without knowing the
source of the data
without looking at the individual
changes that's coming i don't have an
opinion
about whether this drop and roll thing
is true or not
but i'll throw it in the bin with the
things that are 95
likely not to be true could be
could be i'm not debunking it i'm just
saying it's in that category of things
that you shouldn't automatically trust
um in a big news wayne county
which had at one point said two
republicans said we're not going to
certify
the vote in wayne county which would
include detroit which would be a big big
deal
for michigan's overall vote but they
were
threatened and insulted and brow beaten
by their
by their peers until i guess yesterday
they had
decided all right all right all right we
will
certify it and then
after there was much public uproar and
probably because of it
i would guess the two people who had
agreed to certify
rescinded their certification
now it gets more complicated because i
think they rescinded it after it was
submitted and i don't even think
that their certification matters it
might
might not matter i think it's the state
that certifies somebody said
so there there's some lawyer
complication in this
so the fact that they did not certify or
that they reversed their certification
doesn't really tell you which way it's
going to go because you need to
you need to know the details maybe it
ends up in court
who knows but here's what i like about
the story
these two republicans who were
threatened
they were threatened in public they
decided that they would not live
as people who had been cowed
and threatened in public good for them
good for them and indeed i think they
should have
um they should have reversed their
certification just on principle
you know even if they didn't think they
needed to they should have done it on
principle because if you're being forced
to agree at risk of threat
uh that's when you've you've got to go
hard in the other direction
you know you can't let you can't let
that stand so i think we're happy that
that got
reversed the actual functional
difference that it makes
maybe none might not make any difference
to anything
but maybe it does we'll see all right
um
can't you see at this point already
that no matter what happens between now
and forever
would you say that you can already
predict
the following will be true are you ready
can you predict
that some large number of republicans
will believe that the election
was fraudulent no matter what happens
from today on who's with me
would you agree that republicans are
just not going to be convinced
doesn't matter how much evidence is
presented to
debunk the claims the republicans are
going to say okay there were
25 claims and you've allegedly debunked
all 25
but i'll bet there's another 50 things
you didn't find
right no republicans going to believe it
was a legitimate
election it just can't happen there's no
there's no way to get there because you
can't prove a negative
in other words nobody can give you a
piece of proof
and show it to you and say there it is
look at this
there you go there's your proof that
there was no fraud
because you can't prove it doesn't exist
you can only know you didn't find it
right and in an election with so many
complications and precincts and
different systems involved in different
people you can never know if you found
it
you can never know if you've looked hard
enough
to find it it's unknowable so we don't
have a way to get past this
we will have a president we will have
one president eventually
but we don't have any system for this
we'll figure it out you know it's not
going to be the end of the republic
we'll figure it out
but there's no way we can get to the end
of this without people thinking
that trump was really elected president
it just can't be done at this point
all right um
the uh here's another rumor that's being
debunked
i guess uh officials in our government
are debunking
the claim that the u.s army seized some
election related servers in germany you
heard that story
allegedly the cia and the army you know
seized some german servers that had our
election data on it
and that is being denied now the fact
that it's being denied
does that mean it didn't happen
nope it doesn't mean that but we do have
a debunk
from an official source if i had to bet
on it
if you said scott we can't know if it's
true or
no if it's really debunked but what
would you bet on
and i would say i would put a pretty
large bet
on that not being true that there was no
server that got
captured by the us military
um that's just that's just my feeling
about that
what about the hammer and scorecard
software what's your current feeling
about whether those claims are true
that there's software built into the
dominion and maybe other systems
which is designed for the purpose
of throwing an election and changing the
votes
do you believe that's true
i'm going to go with my 95
likelihood it's not true okay
95 likelihood just because it's still in
that category
of all of these claims 95
of them are just not going to be true so
this is just another one
there's no direct proof of it meaning
that
i can't look at it myself i you know i i
haven't examined the code
but we do have individuals who say it's
true
so there there is uh some witness
testimony but they don't actually
show you something they're just talking
are they credible not really
not really doesn't mean they're lying
but they're not in that category of
people you'd say oh yeah if that person
says it
if you hear from this person that's true
we don't have that kind of witness
we have the kind of witness you'd say to
yourself
could be true but i'm not going to
believe it just because i'm hearing it
from this one or two people
so let me separate the question
of whether a hammer and scorecard are
real
from the related but different question
of whether the system could have been
gamed or hacked in general
my belief is that the odds of the system
being gamed
or hacked or you know somehow
fraudulently manipulated
in general is very high
closer to 100 the odds of these specific
claims
and those specific pieces of software
probably low
i here's my feeling
if you were smart enough to pull off
this kind of fraud
wouldn't you do it better you know would
it be
so obvious yeah and it seems to me that
since this hammer and scorecard thing
were already out there as
as a thing that you'd find some
different
more clever way to do it writing
different software or something because
that's what they would be looking for
is the hammer and the scorecard so i
don't put too much
trust in those specific claims but i do
believe
that the election is fraudulent
to some degree i don't know if it's
enough to change the election result
but i would say with complete certainty
there is fraudulent and fraud in the
system somewhere
russell james i don't know who he is
exactly but he seems to
uh be technically capable
and as said by based on his analysis
that at least in one portion of the
reported voting
there were more ballots processed within
the time
frame than the equipment is designed to
handle
so he's saying we know these are
fraudulent because you couldn't even
process this many votes in this short a
time
is that generally speaking the kind of
claim
that the class of things that if you
were to
fast forward into the future you would
find out it had been debunked or you
would find out
it had been true not based on the
specifics of this
but that general kind of claim
that it was physically impossible to do
something technologically
how reliable is a claim that something
was
technologically not possible
in in terms of timing and specifically
in terms of timing
i would say that is a very low
credibility
my guess is that this falls into the
category of things that later you find
out oh they had upgraded the system
or they didn't really process them all
in that hour they only
reported some of the things that had
been processed earlier
or we have more processing equipment
than was reported
or the timing of when it was actually
done is different or 10 000 different
explanations so if i had to put in
odds on this one again again
without saying it's necessarily false
how would i know
i'm going to say it's in the category of
things that are 95 percent
likely to be false
okay again probably
there's probably fraud but the specific
claims probably not
how about the minnesota spike
the 4 a.m minnesota spike
is that proof of fraud
or has it been debunked well the
president
tweeted out that claim i think yesterday
so and a lot of credible people are
looking at that and saying
uh how do you get this gigantic
dump of votes all in four four in the
morning
and they're mostly very very much mostly
for biden looks a little suspicious
doesn't it
well us usa today
attempted to debunk that by saying that
we expected that spike and all it was is
they counted the votes
in a uh abiden territory
and once you have uh the votes from the
biggest city
that you know is going to go strongly
for biden that's all it was
that's all it was you were waiting for a
big population center
and then it came in and you already knew
that that big population center would
vote quite overwhelmingly for biden
and they did so so where's the fraud
the the bump was just what they expected
and the outcome was what they expected
to
where's the fraud well here's the
problem
the claim is not demonstrated
at least not proven by the data that we
have so far
in other words the fact that there's a
big bump at 4am doesn't prove anything
would you agree simply the fact that a
metropolitan area
got counted and reported at four in the
morning
by itself doesn't mean anything
i think you'd agree also by itself
the fact that most of them were biden
votes that alone also doesn't prove
anything
because you already knew that city was
going to go by them but here's what you
don't know
how many were there supposed to be
so there's this you know if you see it
on a chart
you see these little little bumps coming
in for the smaller areas reporting and
then there's this gigantic surge
which is was it mini
i forget milwaukee or someplace
but how big was that big surge
supposed to be does anybody know
was that a surge 20 percent bigger than
the number of voters how would you know
if i were going to fix this election
i wouldn't necessarily doing do it by
faking
a gigantic surge of votes at 4 am
because that would be a little bit
obvious but suppose i thought to myself
there's this big batch that's going to
come in at 4 a.m
it's legitimate but if i added
20 and the same ratio as the rest
would anybody notice see here's what you
wouldn't want to do you wouldn't want to
add so many biden votes
that it is so far different than the
poll numbers that it's obviously fake
so you wouldn't want to have 99 biden
votes
right too obvious let's say the votes
that were natural
were 75-25 i don't know what they were
but let's say that
75-25 if you were going to add some fake
votes
you would just make them also 75-25
it would be invisible because nobody
knows how many votes there were supposed
to be
because we did it differently this year
there's no baseline no history to look
at
because we didn't do this many mail-in
votes before
so the perfect crime is to go for the
biggest
batch of votes that were already going
to go to biden
and just make it bigger right now
um what evidence do i have that that's
what happened none
none i don't have any evidence that that
happened i'm just telling you
if you were going to do a crime you
would do it the smart way
and it's pretty obvious what the smart
way is
don't make it 100 biden votes go where
there's already a lot of votes and you
don't know what the number is supposed
to be
add 20 percent that's how i'd do it
how would you do it right
somebody says it was obvious and i i
don't think you're right on that
i don't think it was obvious i i think
it feels obvious
but there was going to be a big bunch of
biden votes
as soon as those votes came in it was
going to happen you just don't know how
big it was going to be
all right let's talk about
benford's law some of you know about
this
benford's law has to do with the fact
that certain
digits will naturally occur more often
than others
for example the digit one if you're
looking at lots of random numbers
there should be more of the digit one
than there would be of other
digits now i don't know
i don't know exactly why that makes
sense but apparently there's something
to it
so when you do the benford analysis
on the votes it looks like there's
it violates benford's law so it looks
like they're
unnatural which would suggest that
somebody uh
rigged them but experts
on data analysis have weighed in and
said ah
that bedford law doesn't work all the
time
and one of the cases in which it
wouldn't work is exactly this one
where you have a cap on the number of
votes and they're roughly evenly divided
between
two parties democrats and republicans
under that specific situation say
some number of experts i don't know if
it's all of them or
some of them say some experts benford's
law does not apply
because you have this artificial
situation with a
cap on the number of votes and the fact
that you already know it's about 50
50-ish
i don't know i'm no expert in this area
so i will just tell you that there is a
a debunk being offered
this sounds to me as strong as the
original claim
i would say ah i can't tell if the
original claim
sounds good but i also can't tell if the
debunk
sounds good i call it a tie so i
wouldn't put
too much weight on that benford thing
um pfizer
says that their vaccination is 95
effective this comes uh soon after
was it moderno said that their their
vaccination was 94.5
effective and pfizer had before said
they
think it's better than 90 and
coincidentally
and this is just a wonderful coincidence
when pfizer looked a little more closely
at their claim that their vaccinations
were over 90 percent effective
what a coincidence they found out that
it was just a little bit better
than their competition so you can trust
that
can't you speaking of
coincidental numbers uh but
let's let's be uh positive and say that
that's probably true
ish it's in that it's in that category
and now
now that uh it looks like biden has more
votes
you see the news is willing to say that
if you've had the virus once
you probably do have long-term immunity
so now that uh you know people think
that uh trump will not be
reelected now they're willing to say
yeah
you were probably right about that that
long-term immunity
don lemon is up to his old tricks of
mind-reading the president i watched a
clip of him saying that trump
knows he lost does don lemon
no does he know
that trump knows he lost because
i don't think he knows he lost now i
also can't read his mind
but i would say that the claim that he
knows he lost
is just crazy talk it's crazy talk
he's certainly not acting like he lost
and there are certainly
tons of claims if you had to say based
on what you know of this president
does he believe he lost i think he
believes it's possible
but there's so many claims of fraud i
think he believes he won
if i had to put money on it but again
since i'm not
insane i'm not going to try to imagine
what
you know somebody thinks um
cnn is doing this clever trick so nick
robertson had a
a piece on cnn.com and he this is a
sentence from his piece he says
while trump wages a legal fight at home
over what he falsely alleges
is election fraud blah blah blah
blah now this is a news site
it's a news site so they deal in facts
right now even though it's an opinion
piece
if you run an opinion piece on a new
site
the news editors are probably going to
weigh in
if you say something that's just not
true all right
so you can be opiniony but it's a news
site they don't want you putting stuff
in there that's not real
um and nick robertson was allowed
to publish a statement that says that
he's
that the president is falsely alleging
election fraud
how does anybody know that how does
anybody know it's false
nobody knows that you know you could
have an opinion
you could think i think when it's all
done there won't be that much fraud to
change the election
that would be reasonable might be right
might be wrong but it's reasonable
right um but let me tell you what
is just flat out not reasonable
to say that the president's claims of
fraud are false
you can't say that you could say it
might turn out that way
right but how in the hell does nick
robertson
know what the election software says
has nick robertson done a line-by-line
code check
to find out there's nothing in that
software has he counted the ballots
himself
how in the world does he come to this
conclusion that
that it's false here's what would have
been fair
it would have been fair to say
he makes these allegations the legal
system is looking into it
cnn cannot confirm any of these
allegations to be true
that would be fair right but to just
flat out say they're false
while this is while the process is
ongoing and nobody really knows the
answer
of whether it's false is really
irresponsible
for a news organization even as an
opinion it's irresponsible
right here's the best brainwashing trick
the democrats are using
on you right now and it's basically that
so the best brainwashing trick is that
because the courts have not confirmed
any fraud in the election it is
therefore proven not to exist
that's what they're trying to convince
you that while the process is ongoing
and we don't know how it's going to end
because the court has not yet ruled
that there's definitely fraud that's
proof it's not there
now that is that's some pretty devious
brainwashing
because it's not rational they can only
prove they haven't found it
but they also aren't looking for it are
they
is cnn doing a code review of the
software
don't think so where would you hide any
mischief
if you were going to rig an election
where would it be
where would you hide the signs of that
in the code it'd be in the software
that'd be one of the places
you could also do it with paper ballots
so
if cnn isn't looking into it
and there's nobody else looking at the
code as far as i know
right can anybody do a fact check on me
is there anybody doing a line by line
software review of all the software that
was involved
in this election no i don't think so
i feel like we'd know about that so
nobody's looking for it
so to say that we haven't looked for it
and we didn't find it therefore it
doesn't exist
they're actually selling you that and
people are buying it
a lot of people are buying it amazingly
and they're also pretending with this
word widespread we've talked about this
before
they're trying to make the claim that
there's no
widespread fraud meaning it's not under
every rock and everywhere
but nobody's making that claim the claim
is it's
in strategically selected cities
because that's where you can make the
difference there's only a few places you
can make a difference
so the claim is that's the place that's
happening the claim is not widespread
nobody makes that claim
so they're debunking a non-claim
so here's my opinion for a normal crime
say a burglary or a murder
if you saw nothing missing from your
house
you would probably eventually conclude
you had not been robbed
if you did not find any dead bodies or
any signs that anybody is missing
could you conclude that a murder had not
been committed
well you can't be 100 sure but you can
be pretty sure
there's no body and there's not even a
claim of a body
so a lack of evidence in those cases
would be
not proof but pretty good sense of
certainty
that there's no actual crime but those
different
those crimes burglary and murder are
very different
from this big complicated election
situation
for the election situation i think you
have to look at the situation
and if the situation is one in which it
will always go in one direction
because that's the situation then you
don't have to find
proof that it went in that direction
because there's only one way it could go
let me give you an example
if you live in a bad part of town where
there's a lot of crime
and you leave your front door open and
then you
go on vacation for two weeks
do you have to check to find out if a
crime happened
and your apartment was robbed remember
you're in a high crown neighborhood
you left your door open all day and all
night and nobody was home
do you have to check to find out if you
were robbed
no no you don't have to check
you were robbed because the situation
is one in which it can only go one way
there's only one way that can go right
now nothing's impossible so maybe you
know you could imagine or some chance it
didn't happen
but you should assume it happened
now the election has
a huge upside potential if you can rig
it and get away with it
so it's like the biggest the biggest
gain you could make would be fixing an
election
so it's a big payoff that's one
requirement
secondly it's feasible
we've heard how many like 15 different
ways to rig an election
it's certainly feasible at the very
least you could get an insider
working at one of these election
software companies
you could bribe them or threaten them
until they put in some code
so it's feasible we just haven't
seen it in a way that's court proven
right
but definitely feasible huge upside gain
lots of complication and lots of people
involved
and we have when you have lots of people
involved that's the part that guarantees
you can find somebody willing to take a
chance because if you have enough people
you can get somebody who's willing to do
absolutely anything
you just need enough people and the
election system has lots of people
so you're going to have crooks because
you got lots of people
you got opportunity to fix it and it's
the biggest gain you could ever
imagine you know fixing an election so
in my view it had to happen
whether or not you can find the specific
proof
is somewhat immaterial it had to happen
and when you add on add to the fact that
half the country thought they were they
were looking at a second term of hitler
of course it happened it couldn't not
happen we just don't know how much
that's the only question the only
question is
wasn't it enough all right
i did a little mask survey on my
twitter account so this is very
unscientific and i ask people
if they think masks work i was
interested what the
the net effect of all the conflicting
news is
here's what you said keeping in mind
that most of my twitter followers are
trump supporting people but 63 percent
said masks do not work now this is just
people not
science right just people 15
uh say they do and 22
said some form of you know maybe maybe
they do
i'm in the maybe category meaning that i
can't know
but maybe maybe so
here's my question we've seen lots of
studies about masks right or at least
you know they exist
if you haven't read them there are
studies that say masks might work there
are studies that say
masks don't work so let's say you want
to be
a pro science person and you want to
follow the science
what do you do what do you do
because there's science that says they
work and their sciences says they don't
work
so how do you follow the science what's
that even mean
so the democrats who like to say
follow the science and joe biden says
that is some of the dumbest things
anybody could ever say follow the
science
assumes first of all you can determine
which science to follow
and you can't you're just sort of
guessing
and secondly it assumes that the
scientists
and the people putting together the
studies are
credible and do not have a dog in the
fight
but they usually do half of studies end
up
not being valid so anybody who says
follow the science
they're either very young or stupid
because that mantra follow the science
feels like really bad advice
like really bad advice what you should
do
is be really really careful about
following the science
wouldn't that be better instead of
follow the science
follow the science follow this audience
they don't follow the science
we follow the science they don't follow
the science
that's all we're getting now and it's
just flat out stupid
smarter is be very careful
be very careful about following the
science
you want to look at it you definitely
want to look at it and you want to make
you know
keep working toward refining it and
getting it
as credible as it can be but
follow science is for suckers and idiots
it really is consider it important to
look at
and make sure you understand it and and
all that very important
but follow it blindly that would be for
stupid people
not you you're all
you're all smart uh there's a new york
times op-ed
by um crystal
what's his first name uh kristoff
uh not crystal kristoff i don't think
he's been a big trump supporter in the
past but he says this
quote some things are true even though
president trump says them
a great way to start an article um quote
trump nicholas kristoff i think is his
first name
uh quote trump has been demanding for
months the school's reopened
and on that he seems to have been
largely
right schools especially elementary blah
blah do not appear to have been major
sources of transmission
and remote learning has been a
catastrophe i'm summarizing the rest of
the statement
now how big a deal is that
it's a pretty big deal because if you're
gonna
if you're gonna blame trump for the
united states having a high
uh coronavirus infection rate and people
do
you're going to have to also give them
credit
for getting this thing right when
remind me hold on remind me the people
who said to close the schools
were they following the science
yeah they were they were they thought
they were
that's the problem they thought they
were following the science
but were they no there was a little bit
of science
and then people used their subjective
opinion
and they followed their object their
subjective opinion
that's what they followed they never
followed the science
because apparently the science was
pointing in the other direction
so what science they were following was
either wrong or incomplete
or not credible or out of context or
something
so here's a perfect example joe biden
followed the science
and he would have said keep the schools
closed
follow the science who would have been
right
trump or biden trump would have been
right
because the science caught up to trump
that's what kristoff is saying
the science caught up with trump
now trump of course was not making a per
se
a scientific claim he was saying that
kids don't
you know have symptoms as much but he
was making the larger claim that on
balance
it's better to take this risk and
science caught up to him so i feel as
though
if you're going to give him the blame
for the death count you
also have to give science the blame for
destroying a year of our children's
lives
right that's not on trump that's on
science
so if you're keeping score
science is a tie on masks because at
first they said no
then they said yes and now we're seeing
studies coming out to say no
and yes so on masks i would say
science versus trump it's kind of a tie
because i you know i i think it's a
maybe so
i'd say still wear them but trump said
that too
trump also said you know we don't know
i'm pro-mass go ahead and wear them i
think trump was
as right as science was on masks
i think on lock on shutdowns of the
economy
we're also seeing studies that say those
don't work
are those studies credible no cause 100
of the studies you see about coronavirus
are not credible
none of them you know i hope the
vaccines are credible
at least at least with the vaccines they
set it up so they can measure something
that's
measurable so that's probably credible
but pretty much all of these studies
about mass and lockdowns and
kids in schools and pretty much all of
that is not credible
and there will be studies on both sides
all right so trump was right on
something pretty pretty big
the school stuff according to kristoff
and i think he's
i think he's right on that
[Applause]
i i'm seeing uh people tweeting that
they're worried
about how to unbrainwash trump
supporters
after trump is out of office
somebody says scott don't let the coven
19 hype
panic you i wouldn't say i'm panicked
or frightened in any strange way
if you were to compare how much i'm
afraid if i could use that word
afraid to capture nervous or concerned
all those things
if you said how afraid am i of the
coronavirus today
versus let's say march
or april of this year i would say
in march or april it was kind of like a
nine out of ten
for my personal safety like i was really
worried
i don't want to get this because i could
die you know i've got a certain age etc
today i almost have no fear
of it now that's not because i shouldn't
have fear
and i'll still use my common sense to
you know take all the right precautions
that make sense in my
opinion but i've lost
[Music]
basically all of my fear is anybody else
having the same
a reaction so it's not that the science
changed that much
i would say that my risk of getting it
is roughly what it was before
my risk of dying is roughly exactly what
i thought it was
back in the earlier months yeah so i
want to see
i'm looking at the comments i'm seeing a
lot of people agreeing
remember i told you and i tell you this
too much
you can get used to anything if you do
it long enough
you can get used to bad things if you do
it long enough
you can get used to good things of
course fairly easily
so i feel as though what happened is we
just
lived with the virus long enough that it
started to take more of a
perspective and you know we can see it
better in context with all of our other
risks
and i would say my fear
you know the irrational fear i still
have a mental fear
meaning that my brain knows to stay away
from covid
you know it's not like i don't know that
there's a danger
but my my physical part where you're
irrationally shaking you know
i never got to that point but you know
the part where you can't control
the subjective irrational part it's kind
of gone
it's gone now part of it is this
years ago when i had a surgery to
correct my vocal problems
the surgery had a 85 chance of working
15
chance of making me permanently unable
to talk
but that choice was easy to take with no
fear whatsoever
because the alternative was worse so as
long as the alternative is worse
it's pretty easy to make a decision to
do the right thing
and with the coronavirus living
as a prisoner is worse
than the risk of getting the disease and
maybe having a bad outcome
so once you get to the point where you
just say you know it might kill me
and i'm still willing to go to the store
might kill me
and i'd still rather be a free human
being who can go to the store
so the fear just goes away once you
realize it's just
that's your life you gotta live with it
all right so i was talking about the um
the un-brainwashing
of the trump supporters and
here's what would really help if you
wanted
let's imagine that they're being sincere
the democrats
when they say they want to brainwash or
unbrainwash
trump supporters what would be a good
way to start
how about not lying about a hundred
percent of the things you talk about
i mean that would be a start if you
wanna if you want trump supporters to
you know trust democrats or trust their
message or their ideas or anything
the place to start would be to stop
lying about
everything just everything
if you don't start there
don't bother don't bother
don't try to convince trump supporters
that they need to be fixed
because you know who needs to be fixed
carly fiorina needs to be fixed
she needs to be fixed really bad don
lemon don lemon needs some help
he needs to be fixed but trump
supporters
do they do they need to be unbrainwashed
i don't think so were they causing a lot
of violence
were trump supporters hurting people and
rioting nope nope
do you know who needs to be
unbrainwashed
the people who were looting and burning
black-owned
businesses to support less racism
there's a lot of people who need to be
fixed and unbrainwashed
and really you could argue everybody
could
benefit from that we're all we're all a
little brainwashed right
you don't have the option of being the
one person who didn't get a little bit
brainwashed by life
so we're all a little brainwashed we
could all use a little less brainwashing
might be good for all of us but
you would have to be a little bit
credible
to be part of that process and democrats
have not earned that
credibility all right um
here's the most fun thing
of the day that i thought i wrote down
but maybe i didn't but luckily i
remember it
um rasmussen has some numbers coming out
i don't think that they're
public yet but i got a little sneak peek
what percentage of democrats do you
believe
think that is very likely or at least a
little bit likely somewhat likely
what percentage of democrats think it's
somewhat or very likely
that the election was fraudulent
give me your your guesses uh in the
comments
all right so your guesses in the
comments and look at each other's
guesses how many democrats
think the election was stolen i'm going
to read out some of your comments
i'm seeing 45 percent one percent
zero zero fifteen thirty five
ten five the answer is thirty percent
just let that hang there for a little
while democrats
democrats 30
of them think the election was
fraudulent
30 of them
what's that tell you you can't even
convince
democrats that this was a fair election
i mean work with me here right i mean
democrats
are spring-loaded to say oh yeah that
was fair
that was a fair election right there got
just what we wanted
and 30 percent of them can't get there
even 30 percent of democrats know
there's something fishy going on
no i don't know if it was now it's not
specific enough that they would
necessarily believe it would change the
election outcome
all right so that part is not in the
question but 30
of them think there's at least
opportunity and motive
for that now should you be surprised
remember this is a category of people
democrats in which probably 80 percent
of them
believe that trump is an existential
threat
and would destroy the planet earth so if
you were in the
in a group who believed
that there was a chance trump would
destroy
life on earth and you knew your other
democrats and how they felt about it
yeah you would think that they would
cheat you would expect
your fellow democrats to cheat and
indeed
if they had to take the day off and you
were to fill in for them
at the election vote counting place or
whatever
you'd probably cheat too if you think
you're saving the world
so yeah even the democrats feel that
something was going on here
i think that's all you need to know
isn't it i feel like that one
that one data point summed up the entire
everything because you know we're going
to argue forever about you know this
allegation that allegation this
allegation that
allegation but when 30 percent of
democrats even don't believe the
the vote
you don't need to talk about the details
so much now
um let me let me give you my kraken
update
so i've seen uh uh i've seen the details
of the
nevada legal challenge which is just
updated i guess
and the nevada challenge has a lot of
claims on it
a lot of claims and each of those claims
is backed up
with a witness or some some data or some
you know direct observation or video
whatever so they have evidence
and they got a lot of claims here's the
problem with the claims though
when i read the the legal description of
the claims
it's written for a legal process the
legal process has its own requirements
of how you do things
so when i read through it it looked
well written and very clear in terms of
what it was trying to
allege but in terms of
persuasion outside of the legal system
it wasn't that kind of a document so it
left me thinking
i don't know what to think about this
because the claims look
credible some of them look pretty big
like they would be big enough to change
the result
but what they didn't do is this is the
part
that i needed because i'm not a lawyer
and i'm not a judge
i'm just you know a guy and
what i needed was to see the uh the
bullet points of the claims
with the number of votes that it could
have affected
and a total at the bottom like a summary
so it'd say all right claim one
could affect up to 500 votes let's say a
claim that dead people voted
not you know it's not it's not enough to
change the election
but it does tell you that there was
intention
to cheat right so if you found that 500
dead people voted in nevada
wouldn't change any of the election
outcomes
but it would tell you something it would
tell you that there was an
intention to cheat and that when they
found a way to do it
they took it that tells you something
right
so if you see you know i don't know how
many claims there were
six to ten claims somewhere in that
neighborhood
and if you see them all and then you see
the number of votes that could be very
compelling because i need to see that
subtotal but if you see it in a
long form text of this claim is this and
here's why and then we go on to the next
one
my head can't put them all together so
here's
here's the take away from the legal
document
my takeaway was i saw big
claims that would be big enough to
change the election
but i did not see this is just me
personally
i did not see that all the evidence to
back up those claims
so i can't say that i've seen the kraken
because i've seen big claims
but i haven't you know personally seen
the evidence
and then there are a number of smaller
claims that also look pretty credible
pretty credible but you haven't heard
the other side
remember in a legal context every claim
sounds credible at first
they really do doesn't matter who's
saying what about whom
first claims they kind of always sound
credible
you got to wait for the other side to
talk and so if you're just looking at
what the trump people are alleging yes
it looks very credible
yes it looks credible i don't know what
number of votes would be
influenced that's the part that needs a
little more connecting material
but again you probably don't need that
for the legal process
you do need it for the persuasion game
and the political game so i hope we see
that at some point
here's my take on this we if we're not
learning
something new today
i'm going to lower my slaughter meter
so by the end of today i've got to set
at 97
97 chance that we'll at least find that
the
the election was fraudulent
won't necessarily mean that trump takes
a second term
but 97 chance will find the election
fraudulent
i will lower that to 75
at the end of today if there's no new
news
that that changes that okay and by
friday
i'll lower it again to 50
again if i haven't heard new information
that would that would raise it
you should be doing the same thing in
your minds right
because you don't want to be caught
thinking there was a 100
chance that this is going to be proven
and then a month from now you got
nothing
you know you want to give yourself a
little bit of the cats on the roof
you want to talk yourself out of your
belief
gently right because nobody else is
going to be able to talk you out of it
so you need to be able to talk yourself
out of it if the evidence is not
going your way eventually right there's
a time and a place and we're not there
yet
at the moment i'm perfectly willing to
say
the reason you haven't seen the good
stuff is because it takes a while
just you know this would take months if
this were a normal process
they would take months to research this
they've got a few weeks
so i wouldn't put too much
uh weight on the fact that you haven't
seen
conclusive proof yet it just hasn't been
enough time
but if you're not seeing it by
friday-ish
i'm going to feel that that tells you
something
right and i'll lower it to 50 on friday
now if next week i'm down to 20 which is
entirely possible
and then it turned out that the election
you know didn't find any major fraud
and it just uh biden just took office at
least
i would not be in cognitive dissonance
i would still think that there was fraud
in the election because there always has
to be in this
setup but i wouldn't know that it
changed the result
and i wouldn't necessarily make that
claim
so i so i'm in the process
of talking myself off the roof just in
case
because i want to be in a position where
if the if the
data doesn't go in my way the way i
think it
should go that i'm not out there like a
crazy person saying it was 100
100 don't be the 100
person be the 95 person
all right um i do think there's a very
good chance
that the legal process will force
more audit i think the odds of that are
pretty good
and i think that's all they need because
if they can buy
time force an audit force a digger
digger a deeper dig
they'll find something all right
somebody says of course it changed the
result that's why they did it
well they couldn't have known in advance
how much to cheat so
you can be sure that people tried you
can't be sure they succeeded
question is with what you've seen do you
think it is enough
um with what i've seen i've not seen
proof
so i've seen allegations of things that
look
really very credible that would be
smallish
in other words if you added the if you
added them together they probably
wouldn't change the outcome
and i've seen big claims that would
change the outcome
but i haven't personally seen
something that puts me on that team i
think
there's a 100 percent chance that the
voting
software system has been at least
attempted by somebody foreign powers
democrats bad actors whoever
but somebody has of course tried to
compromise the voting system there's no
doubt about that
you know over years and years and years
and all the bad actors in the world and
all the opportunities they would have
and the fact that it's software at all
guarantees us somebody's going to take a
run at it
what we don't know is if they've already
succeeded
if you wait long enough the bad actors
will get control of the election process
they will it's kind of unavoidable
because they can keep trying and failing
forever
they only have to succeed once and then
they own it
right so oh let me let me talk about the
big reset
i think the big reset is just a bunch of
 and you should just ignore all
of it
that's what i'm doing the the big reset
here's my problem with it it is true
that people are saying out loud people
in power are saying out loud
that the coronavirus gives us an
opportunity to sort of reboot society
and
rethink how we do everything but that's
just true
that's not a plan that's just
an observation it's the first thing that
i and lots of people said when the
pandemic started you know i'm not part
of some big
reset plan to take over the world
but it was obvious to me that a whole
bunch of things would be different
and that we should take the opportunity
to say hey if everything's up in the air
for a few months
let's let's redesign some stuff let's
see what else we can do
so if you're worried about the great
reset is how the socialists take over
i think everybody looks to take
advantage of a crisis
but i don't know that there's a meeting
somewhere where they're having
big reset strategy meetings i
i wouldn't uh says scott you're missing
on this point
klaus schwab is klaus schwab somebody i
can
look at i'm sure that if i look at it
i'll find that there's somebody who says
it's my plan
to do the great reset and change the
world
but because it was somebody's plan it
doesn't mean much
because the pandemic was going to happen
and it was going to change things
it was just going to happen i wouldn't
worry about it too much
all right that's enough for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
you youtubers are still here periscope
is
turned off you know one of the things
i've noticed when i look at the comments
the uh there's a real difference between
the youtube
comments and uh and the periscope
comments the periscope comments are
mostly people who follow me on twitter
and so they tend to be friendlier the
the youtube comments are far
more trolls and the the trolls that are
the dumbest
are the ones who imagine they know what
i'm thinking
or they imagine they know what what i
know
and those are just always ridiculous you
don't know what i'm thinking
you don't know what i know or what i
don't know
yeah yeah people are more crass here i
think just youtube is a bigger platform
so it brings in
brings in more people
uh
all right just looking at some of my
printer update i could not get my
printer to work this morning
i had to use a different printer and i'm
going to probably
try once to upgrade the
drivers but after that i'm going to
throw it over the throw it end of the
window
um
people whose stuffed belts broke the law
and should be charged
of course they should
um where is the right place to look for
fraud
well the the right place is with the
paper ballots
and then the second right places with
the software
so and yeah that's a big statement
you have to look at the paper ballots
but things you should look for
for example how many ballots do you
think should have been sent to the same
address
if there's somebody who got 50 ballots
at the same address
i'd look into that and
there's some claims of that sort of
thing
klaus schwab runs davos somebody say
i'll go i'll google him
but i'm pretty sure it's not going to
change my opinion that the great reset
is just wishful thinking
um
all right yeah trump's thing is going to
be in an hour so let's make sure we're
ready for that
um oh some are saying that the buildback
better is a
is the great reset language now i would
say
so i have some special insight on that
build
back better thing it goes like this
as a professional creative person you
know i write
jokes for a living and you would be
amazed how many times i will write a
joke
and i'm positive i'm the only person who
could
have thought of that joke and i'll see
somebody
saying the same joke in an hour
it happens all the time so there are
things that you think
there's no way two people independently
thought of this
happens all the time and then if
somebody
puts it out there other people see it
maybe they don't remember they saw it
but it sticks in their head then they're
coming up with their own ideas
and they use it but they don't remember
they saw it let me give you an example
years ago i did a comic about a
a fake opera singer
and in my comic this was dilbert comic
from
25 years ago i said that the
name of the fake opera singer was
placebo domingo now his real name was
placido domingo but the joke was a
he was a fake opera singer named placebo
domingo
now i wrote that comic and finished it
and was ready to submit it
and before i had submitted it i picked
up the newspaper and there was a comic
strip called
travels with farley in it and i look at
the newspaper
and that day in the newspaper
for that day was a comic in which he
talked about
a fake opera singer named placebo
domingo
that day while my comic was sitting next
to me
that day's newspaper had my joke placebo
domingo
and by the way it was not suggested
by anything that was happening in
current events
it was literally my mother used to
listen to him
placido domingo and so it was a name in
my head
it was nothing that triggered both of us
to think of it at the same time
what i'm telling you is that
coincidences that look like they
couldn't possibly be a coincidence
happen all the time in my in my work the
number of times i'll do a comic and then
see somebody
make exactly the same comic that's a lot
it's a lot so my comic i did not submit
i threw it away
i i trashed mine and
uh because i knew that if i printed it
everybody would say well you just copied
his comic
so i couldn't do it
alright that's all for now and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
