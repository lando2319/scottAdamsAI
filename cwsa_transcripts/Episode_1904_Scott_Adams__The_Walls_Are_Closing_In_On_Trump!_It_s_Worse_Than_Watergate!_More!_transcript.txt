foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
highlight of civilization
some say it's Stonehenge but no it's
coffee with Scott Adams the best thing
that'll ever happen to you and it's
happened to you right now
think about it the best thing that will
ever happen to you is happening right
now wow that's pretty amazing I want to
take it up a notch yeah you do you do
that's the kind of person you are and
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker cell system the canteen sugar
flask of a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being here the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go
um yeah yep yep yep that's some good
stuff good stuff
so um I saw a hashtag on Twitter this
morning that's quite active
uh
that is the hashtag is what should Scott
Adams be for Halloween
now I think somebody played a prank I'm
just guessing based on the comments
so there must be some prank out there
that says I'm going to pay three hundred
thousand dollars for the best suggestion
for a Halloween outfit
and apparently when people believe
you're going to pay three hundred
thousand dollars for your Halloween
outfit suggestion you get a lot of
suggestions
so just to be clear I am not offering
three hundred thousand dollars for a
Halloween suggestion
but somebody got away with that prank so
if you find if you see who did that
prank it must be a tweet on somewhere
there's a tweet that I didn't see
but uh can you send it send it to me
if uh if you can DM me I just want to
see who did that that's pretty funny
um
Dilbert
is at the end of the uh Series in which
he uh
in which he got passed over for a
promotion for being a white male and
it's based on my own corporate
experience so the series in Dilbert is
Loosely based
uh on my actual real life experience I
was kind of hoping I would get canceled
over this
because if I get got canceled over my
real life experience that would be a
good story
it's like you can't say this and then I
would say what do you mean I can't say I
Can't Describe what happened to me like
just ordinary things that happened to me
in my real life I can't put that but
nobody complained
so I'll tell you what I've done
apparently I have
increased the size of the envelope of
what's acceptable because I didn't get
any pushback for this at all
but today's series I had a problem
because I had Dilbert quitting because
he got passed over for promotion
and if you're a cartoonist
whatever you do to your characters when
you're done you have to bring them back
to their original situation
so that tomorrow can just be a normal
comic
so I had to so I had to deal with the
fact that Dilbert just quit his job
but he can't really quit his job right
he's got to come back
so here he is talking to Carol the admin
and uh Carol says I thought you quit and
dilber says I I quote quiet quit I'll
keep coming to work and getting paid but
only so I can give fodder for the comic
strip I'm starting that's my actual
experience and then she says you have no
art skills whatsoever
also based on my actual experience and
then dilber says True by being qualified
for my job didn't work out either
also directly based on my experience
so when I went from the thing that I was
completely qualified for
which is a banking yeah and then also a
telecom job
I didn't do well
but as soon as I left what I was
qualified to do and went where I was
completely unqualified like completely
success
based on a true story
so did anybody notice I seemed a little
grumpy yesterday
did anybody picked that up was there any
like little little Keys little little
signals or anything
a little bit a little bit
so I'll tell you what I did
um so my problem was and I don't want to
be old man talks about his health
problems except there's something
interesting about this that might have a
general value to you
which is God damn it
what is wrong with my phone
so what I was trying to figure out why
um
my energy was at about 25 and was
staying there
and the trouble is that when your energy
is low there are too many things it
could be so I spent yesterday afternoon
you know with my whiteboard first
writing down all the things that could
be and then using my iPad to look for
all the symptoms of each of those things
and then figuring out you know which one
was most likely so here are all the
things that could have been
so these are the things that and and
probably the list is much longer but
here are the things it could have been
it could have been long coveted it could
have been vax injury if either of those
are actual real things could have been
diet diabetes blood pressure meds heart
disease endocrine problems old age
arthritis autoimmune issues or
depression
somebody said weed that's not on the
list because I know what weed feels like
I know weird huh but I actually know
what that one feels like it doesn't feel
like this
so then then what I did was I looked at
these symptoms for each and then I
started you know ranking them for how
close they were to the symptoms
so a number of these I could rule out
because of timing
or the specific something for example
the arthritis didn't fit because it
wasn't joints I don't have joint pain I
have mostly muscular pain so and old age
didn't fit because the symptoms came on
quickly
so there must have been something going
on right
um so I went to the list and I narrowed
it down to four possibilities the the
most likely possibilities
one is long covet
but I think the odds of any one person
having long covet are kind of low
when do you think
so I don't know
uh the other one is uh BP Beds which is
very likely that's a very likely one uh
endocrine issues which you know end up
looking like other things and depression
so when I looked up the uh
all the symptoms which one do you think
matched exactly
which One Max met some of you already
know the answer which one matched my
symptoms exactly
depression
depression
so
very interesting finding now here's the
thing I learned about depression by you
know being Dr Google and just Googling
around did you know this
did you know that people who are
depressed
feel they feel weak and they feel the
lack of energy
right and that's what I was feeling I
was I was seriously having trouble
walking up and down stairs and also
um everything hurt
like just everything hurt
um and it turns out that those are the
exact symptoms of depression
did you know that but here's here's the
uh the real key this this might be the
what would you call it the Rosetta Stone
that kind of opened up the the whole
possibility here
the thing that really
um makes me think that's what it is I
have two extra pieces of information
number one apparently there was a study
to see if depressed people were
physically weaker
what do you think the answer was are
depressed people physically weaker
most of you say yes the answer is ironic
not ironically but surprisingly it's the
opposite
depressed people are A Little Bit
Stronger Than non-depressed People it
all it almost makes sense because I
could see myself like feeling depressed
and having to pick up an object I'd be
like ah you think
so I could almost see that being
depressed will make you stronger but it
makes you physically stronger
while you feel too weak to walk up the
stairs
isn't that weird
you're actually stronger
but you feel weaker to the point where
you can't walk up the stairs
now here's why I was so confused
because my symptom was that if I went to
the gym
like I went to the gym yesterday
sat in a chair and stared at a wall and
then drove home because it was all I
could do
I actually couldn't get out of the chair
and lift lift anything or sit on
anything
and I almost couldn't stay awake on the
way to the of the the gym it was hard
driving and staying awake even though it
was the middle of the day
and
uh
somebody says bipolar is two different
versions of depression but we'll get to
that in a minute so here so the first
the first clue was that my current
ability to lift is the highest it's ever
been
so yesterday I was so low energy I
literally couldn't even touch a weight
but I made it to the gym and I call that
a win because as long as my system works
as long as my habit is intact I'll get
back on on cycle in a bit so my habit is
I'm going to the gym
if I don't want to go to the gym I go to
the gym if I do want to go to the gym I
go to the gym if I absolutely can't go
to the gym there's just no way I can go
to the gym I go to the gym
so that's my rule it doesn't matter how
much I can't go to the gym I go to the
gym
because usually you can do a little bit
of a workout
so yesterday was the day that I really
really couldn't work out it just wasn't
physically possible
but I went to the gym
so to me that's 100 percent
a plus
bad on the back
good job because that's the person I
want to be right
right the person you want to be is the
person who made it to the gym anyway and
then failed
but but you know I'm very stubborn about
some things
and if I'm going to fail I'm going to
fail at the gym
like I'm not going to fail before I go
to the gym if I'm going to fail I'm
going to go all the way to the gym
before I fail
so
so that was consistent with depression
but here was the here was the other clue
so last night after an entire day of
really I couldn't do anything after
about 11 in the morning like I could
drive somewhere but that was about it
couldn't do anything couldn't work
couldn't do anything
uh I had a positive social interaction
I had a positive social interaction
and all of my symptoms went away
think about that
all of my symptoms went away
with one positive social interaction
now I still have one other hypothesis
I have one other hypothesis which is it
still could be the blood pressure meds
because I take them uh once a day at
night
and last evening was the longest I'd
been without taking it right because
it's an hour before I take it again
so
it's entirely possible that it's just
the blood pressure meds
but the blood pressure medicine I don't
think would explain everything else and
then the depression does
I don't take statins now
so
I woke up still in a great mood I think
you can tell right I'm not faking it I'm
actually in a terrific mood right now
and nothing in my physical condition
changed
nothing changed
nothing in my life changed nothing in my
diet meds nothing changed yesterday
except one positive social interaction
and then suddenly all of my symptoms
went away I was actually like running
around the house last night at 10
o'clock at night like actually running
you know just sort of jogging from one
room to the other doing just doing some
stuff I needed to do
and all of it went away
now this morning I'm pretty stiff just
because I'm always stiff in the morning
so I don't know what today looks like
but I just want to put this in your
heads that I had no idea
what Depression was supposed to feel
like
did you
I didn't know what it was supposed to
feel like
so I I had ruled it out because I
thought it would be different
you know I'd always heard people who had
genuine depression and they'd say trust
me I can't get out of bed
and I said to myself I don't even
understand that
how can you be alive
and you know all of your body parts work
and you can't get out of bed
like explain that to me I don't get that
and I experienced it and what it was was
a disconnect between my brain and my
um
uh what do you call it dopamine
have you ever felt that I I could feel
the complete disconnect between my my
brain saying go do something it's time
to do this thing
and my body didn't have the dopamine
which allows you to actually move
I had no dopamine so dopamine if you
didn't know this is what translates your
thoughts into motion
so you could have all the thoughts of
the world but if you have no dopamine
you'll just sit there and look at the
wall
as soon as you have dopamine you go oh
you get up and do the thing you were
thinking you need to do
take iodine well I very much appreciate
all your suggestions but I want you to
know
that there are too many of them
there are too many of them so I've seen
you know five or six different
suggestions I probably won't be trying
those because I'm not sure if you heard
me say
one positive social interaction affects
me
so we'll see if that plays out anyway
um
sometimes it does pay to be your own
doctor
Peter Bergen writing for CNN had a
headline I don't know if you wrote the
headline
but
um an article that I thought I was not
going to appreciate
he said America is great again
and I said to myself I'm all right it's
Peter Bergen he's writing for CNN he
says America is great again which you
know sounds counter-intuitive at the
moment what kind of dumbass argument is
that going to be
right and I thought it was going to be
Joe Biden you know made a bunch of good
decisions and passed good legislation I
thought it was just going to be some
pro-democrat thing
it actually was more interesting than
that
it was quite provocative and his
argument is that although America
whatever America's problems are his
argument is everybody else is doing
worse
so his argument is that Russia is no
longer the superpower
and that China is in a world of hurt
and while we've got our own issues we're
in much better shape than those two so
in his View and I'm you know this would
be maybe my spin on his view it looks
like we went from a three super power
world to uh one and a half
now that's obviously an exaggeration at
this point but but it does look like
maybe the relative ranks
changed a little bit I don't know
it wasn't a bad opinion
not a bad opinion so I recommend it
there's a test that shows that dogs can
smell stress
is there anybody who has a dog who
didn't already know that
any dog owners
every dog owner knows that
do you know what one of my biggest
problems of working at home with a dog
is
I like to sometimes you know curse or or
just like let out a little frustration
so it'll be a whole and I think I'm
alone right because you don't think of
the dog I know I should I'm such a
humanist I should I don't think of the
dog and I'll be like oh I'll
just go into like a screaming like
yelling rants because my printer is
broken or something and it doesn't last
long the whole thing might last
five seconds
but the dog will go run and hide and
cower in the the far end of the house
until I go get her if if I don't notice
yeah so but it turns out exactly like
you think
dogs can pick out a whole bunch of mood
disorders and uh
uh they can they can detect a panic
attack before you know you're going to
have it
PTSD and even addictive cravings
they could pick out addictive cravings
and maybe stop you from doing a drug
like imagine imagine if you were a drug
addict and you started getting those
cravings and the dog picked it up and
just ran over and started giving you a
bunch of dog love
well the dog loves pretty good too maybe
it'd work maybe it would distract you
anyway the dogs are awesome
um
Rob Reiner tweets today
in too many capital letters with a
discovery of stolen highly classified
nuclear secrets we can now add Espionage
to Trump's mountain of crimes the
indictments can't come soon enough Rob
Reiner
the walls are closing in
well you recognize this play right
we're getting closer to elections so you
knew that the Democrats would say
we have discovered highly damaging
documents in these Mar-A-Lago boxes and
we definitely can't tell you what they
are because they're secret but who wow
those are so bad whoa wow boy is he in
trouble
for what well we can't tell you but has
something to do with nuclear things in
Iran and China
that's a pretty big category isn't it
pretty big category
now yeah so they got them now they got
them I think they're like five different
you know legal problems Trump has just
this week
but
if uh if the past is
predictive
he'll be fine
all right uh Jake Tapper was wondering
why he he said that on the air
I have to say I'm surprised that there
hasn't been a national conversation
about the Damage Done to kids because of
these school closures
now you're probably saying to yourself
whoa CNN is really moving to the right
like they say
I think that's just Jake Tapper being a
dad
and I don't know if he has kids but I
think he does I don't know
doesn't that just sound like a dad
I mean when he well I've heard Jake talk
about it on the air and when he talks
about it I don't hear any politics
what I hear is a really pissed off
father that's what I hear what do you
hear what do you hear him talking about
it that doesn't sound political to me
that sounds personal
yeah like human first
and you know what that reminds me of of
a good Republican political
um approach you ready for this
here's your persuasion tip of the day
you're only a Democrat until your kids
get involved
you can afford to be a Democrat until
they come for your kids
everybody can afford to be a Democrat
until they come for the kids
and then you're a parent
you're not a Republican
you're not a republican if they come for
your kids
and if you're a republican you're not a
republican if they come for your kids
if they come for your kids you're a
parent
and you can see that the the the
political frame just dissolves as soon
as you put the kids in in the mix it
just dissolves
so I think the Republicans have like uh
that would be a powerful thing to say
because you know we're trying to heal
the country find any way that we can
come together and I think that if you
say when the kids are involved
you're not a Democrat you're not a
republican anymore
let's work together on that
how about that right
because I do think you could actually
say directly when the kids are involved
you're no longer it's not politics
anymore
I think that would work
um
I have a real question about whether
Trump can win re-election
because the anti-vaxx
people in the Republican Party are so
many
how are they going to forgive him
now everybody who commented on it so far
said they would
so on Twitter I think every comment I
said I saw everyone
said well I hate that he's a little too
you know pro-vaxi even though he's not
pro Band-Aid he's not pro-mandate so
people people were giving him the out
they were saying he's not pro mandates
who are okay
and here's the reason I doubt that
because you didn't give me that out
where were all the people saying to me
Scott
you know you were you were never
pro-mandated so therefore whatever you
decision you made that's just your own
decision
no nobody gave me that break
did they and you watched it you watched
how brutal people were with me and I was
always against mandates very clearly
against mandates
now are you really going to give Trump a
break on that and you didn't give me a
break on that
really
I'm I'm skeptical I'm skeptical I
suspect that a number of uh
anti-vaccination people are going to say
that's that's my single issue
I you know I can't I can't do with that
yeah I think people are going to be mad
that he didn't fire a fauci
right
people are going to be mad that on his
watch
the Pharma companies did something that
you know many will claim they don't like
so let me ask you this is there anybody
watching here
who will not vote for Trump let's say a
trump supporter
so this is only for people who were
Trump supporters otherwise is there
anybody who will not vote for Trump who
is Republican because of the
vaccinations and whatever you want to
say about the vaccinations is there
anybody who won't any
anybody
uh
everybody's saying no and I think that
means no you don't mind
sing one yes
okay
so basically you all forgive him for
rolling out the vaccination that you
believe is harming the country
is that
is that so you do you this is really
surprising
I'm not sure I believe you honestly
huh
you should give me too
you don't have anything to forgive me
for
whoever it is that said you forgive me
too
why are you forgiving me what did I do
wrong I didn't do anything wrong there
were people who misinterpreted me but I
don't think that was on me
all right
uh
there's a potential cure for pancreatic
cancer
apparently engineers at Duke University
had some way to inject some Radioactive
substance
that they they'll eject the radioactive
substance that's apparently is coded by
something that protects it and it just
emits its radiation directly into the
tumor and apparently it just kills
tumors
it's just waxable
and I don't and the researchers said
there's nothing else that's ever done
this nothing's ever been in this
category of Effectiveness so there's a
long way from you know being available
they tested in mice now they have to do
it in bigger animals and then maybe
humans
but I like I like to bring up these
potential cures pancreatic cancer that's
the one that got Steve Jobs right that's
a big one
um
so maybe maybe
did all of you see the you have to see
this by the way the video of the China
CCP Summit and it's a big Auditorium and
all of the officials with their dark
suits are sitting there and present
sheep and as everybody sits there
quietly
the Bodyguards of President XI come in
and they take away the prior president
the one that she replaced who is sitting
right next to she
and they had to forcibly
physically move this 79 year old out
while there didn't seem to be any
explanation of why
it looked like just a power play some
kind of a he was just making a point she
was but oh my God was it scary looking
and does anybody remember the old videos
of Saddam
do you remember the Saddam
um it looked exactly like that when
Saddam took over
they had you know a big meeting of all
the government people and then Saddam
read the names of people who were going
to be taken out of the room and shot
and then one by one while everybody sat
there scared to death you know the
guards would take out one person at a
time and
kill them
well they all sat there waiting to see
if they were next
and
apparently the ex-president has been
scrubbed from social media already you
can't even search for him
now the I saw one attempt at trying to
explain it away
to explain it as not a political move
and it wasn't a bad explanation and the
explanation was he's 79 years old and he
wasn't feeling well
but he wasn't willing to leave because
he probably didn't want to leave an
empty seat there and it would be
embarrassing and everything so it's
entirely possible that President XI was
doing him a favor
and you know saying no you're really
sick you need to
you need to you know go lay down maybe
I mean if if you saw it you could
actually interpret it either way
he definitely didn't want to leave but
you could imagine somebody who is sick
but it's like the biggest day you know
he wouldn't want to leave on his own so
you can see that they maybe have to you
know guide him out of there for his own
good
maybe it's possible
uh it didn't look like it it looked
political right it completely looked
political but who knows we might be
surprised
um easy is saying again that he's
building a ecosystem a mini City
that will be themed sort of a Yeezy
themed Mini City that would be well
designed
and probably is pretty far along in the
planning of it
um I've told you before that this is the
biggest industry you don't see coming
it's building entire small cities from
scratch
based on everything we know and can do
with modern living and modern technology
and you make it green but you make it
more livable
so design and living are the two things
that haven't been brought together
except for furniture and paint usually
when you talk about design
it's just your interior decorating but
what we don't design as well
is the lifestyle
and the the green part and the how do
you get around and all that stuff so if
easy if he fixes all that
and I think that he might be you know
one model because I plan to build my own
mini City I've told you that right my
longest term plan is to build a mini
City
and freaking yay beat me to it of course
he's probably funding his and himself so
that's makes it easier
but I think that that will be one of the
biggest uh industries of the next
hundred years building all new towns
that are just amazing to live in and low
cost and healthy and all that stuff
very different from the current
situation so did we talk about this
Steve Bannon got sentenced to four
months
uh I think it's actually two two-month
sentence he could serve concurrently or
something maybe I a lot of smart people
think it'll get overturned on appeal
I feel like it will don't you
it's hard for me to believe that Steve
Bannon will really go to jail
it just doesn't feel real yeah because
of Eric Holder Etc so there's a
precedent
I feel like it's going to get overturned
but we'll see
so by election day they could have uh
let's see Trump in jail Steve Bannon in
jail and uh
pretty much everybody else neutered
so
I figure they'll come for me next
coming for me next
all right
I don't have anything else to talk about
but I do have some other things to do
today
and I'm all stuffed up as you can tell
so I feel uncomfortable talking right
now
I'm speaking into existence
and so I think we're going to leave
early but thanks YouTube for joining
