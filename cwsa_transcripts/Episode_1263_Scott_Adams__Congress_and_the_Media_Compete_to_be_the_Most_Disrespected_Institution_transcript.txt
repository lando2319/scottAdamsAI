hey everybody
come on in i'm on the other side of the
world today
uh for a few more days and
even so is that a reason to skip
coffee with god adams no no it's not in
fact it's better every time
every single time and what do you need
what do you do what do you need to make
it special
i don't remember either because i
usually read it but i think it's about
something about a cup or a mug
or a glass a tangered
thing thing and then fill it with coffee
and then drink it i have to admit
that i get up just before i do these
things so i'm usually
kind of a little bit tired haven't had
my coffee
but i know that you will join me now for
the simultaneous step you ready
you ready it's happening now go
oh that's good that is the good stuff
so anything happening yes there are
things happening and we're going to talk
about them
it turns out that
there's a new survey that says the
american mainstream media has reached
a new record what do you think the
record is
that the mainstream media in the united
states has just achieved
well it's a record uh low trust
there's a record for you so only 18
of republicans say they believe
journalists
just believe journalists that's the only
statement
only 18 percent of republicans
believe journalists doesn't even matter
the journalists
they've reached the point where it's not
even do you believe the journalists on
the left
do you believe the journalists who lean
right
nope just uh 18 of republicans
are all that's left who trust
journalists
uh on the other side apparently
democrats um 56
percent of them believe that journalists
and reporters are purposely trying to
mislead wait
no
whatever the number is the number of
democrats by a
by a majority actually think that the
news is real
i don't know what to say about that how
could you
how could you be paying attention to
anything i think that the news is real
in 2021 i don't know how you would come
to that conclusion
based on anything that we've been
watching uh
so that's so that's uh journalism
so they're at uh an all-time low in
trust
now as megyn kelly tweeted do you think
that journalists
and the news business do you think they
take any responsibility
for the fact that they have the lowest
trust of all time
i doubt it i doubt it i'll bet every one
of them thinks it's
president trump's fault or partly my
fault
for saying bad things about the news
so how do you think the news will report
the story about their own lack of
credibility
will the news business say hey there's a
study
that says nobody believes us i guess
there's a good reason for that
and let us report to you all of the
hoaxes that have been perpetrated
through the journalists
and you can see exactly why people don't
trust us
probably not probably won't do any
honest reporting on themselves
although was the uk the daily uh the
daily mail that reported on this
so oddly enough the one thing i trust
that's in the news
is news about how you shouldn't trust
the news
and maybe i should reassess that maybe i
should
just don't trust anything that would be
easier
all right there's a new study that will
be debunked in
10 seconds probably this is me looking
at my watch
even though my watch is nothing but a
naked wrist
the universal let me look at the time
symbol
if you're a certain age you don't know
why people are looking at their risk
wrist to determine the time it makes no
sense
unless you have an apple watch all right
so there's a study that says that uh
there's a high correlation between the
spikes
and surges in the coronavirus in europe
and
latitude and the implication is
that latitude is important because
vitamin d
from the sun is uh very
correlated with the latitude so as the
earth is
rotating during the year the different
parts of the sun will get
more you know sun exposure but here's
the thing that most people don't know
and maybe i don't know it either because
when i tell you this i might be getting
it wrong
but the idea is
that uh you think that if the sun is
down
all year long that you just have to go
out in that sun even if it's the winter
and it's the sun hey the sun's the sun
but it turns out winter sun
is almost useless for vitamin d did you
know that
did you know that getting sun in the
winter doesn't help that much
for vitamin d so it has to do with the
latitude blah blah
but getting getting say 20 minutes in
the middle of the summer
it's not just because it's hotter or
whatever it's a
it's a more direct vitamin d hit during
certain seasons
so this study showed that or i tried to
show
uh of course it was debunked in about a
minute and a half
doesn't mean the debunk is right just
somebody had some complaints with it
and it purported to show that the
vitamin d levels
as highly correlated with latitude and
time of year
would be more of a reason for the spikes
than some other other factors
what do you think of that here's what
you should say
here's what i'm saying to myself here
and this is the way you should look at a
study like this
can you personally look at that study
and determine if it had been done well
nope but you can't even if you're a
scientist
be you can't read a study and say it's
good or bad just by reading a report
you can't do that so what percent
odds should you put on something that's
a
report it's a scientific it shows its
work
low you know i think 50 of published
papers
eventually get debunked so the highest
credibility if you put on it would be 50
and then start subtracting from there
based on any other factors
so here's the other factor that i put on
it how much would i
having talked about vitamin d from the
beginning
being being an important thing
how much would i like this study to be
true
and the answer is it'd be great for me
personally might be great for the world
as well if it gives us
you know some other tools for fighting
the infection but
my bias is that since i
am on record for publicly talking about
the likelihood that vitamin d would be a
big factor
wouldn't i love to be right i would
right
i want this study to be true so
the first thing you should say to
yourself when you're looking at
information that agrees with you
the first thing you should say is why do
i think this is true
do i think it's true because i can read
a study like this
and i can personally understand that
it's credible
no no i look at it and i want it to be
true
and i think it should be true so
therefore i
you know i'm willing to to buy into a
thing that has no better than
50 credibility and probably lower after
people have looked at it and
and debunked its methodology so i
wouldn't put too much credibility in
there but
that's just one thing that's out there
all right here
is the most fascinating example of
cognitive dissonance i've seen in a
while
and you're almost going to have to look
at this yourself
to believe that i'm telling you the
truth
it's a little bit of one of these
yawning and laurel things where there's
an actual uh
an illusion of some kind that's in the
story and you're gonna see it
and it's fascinating so there was a
tweet by
uh vox.com writer aaron rhubar
and you've probably seen him on uh seen
him on social media he's
pretty big presence on social media and
he's a big
anti-trumper uh etc
and so here's what he tweeted
um or was this what he was talking about
was either what he tweeted or was
talking about
i asked about trump's this is a face the
nation did an interview with dr
burks and face the nation asks
asked dr burks about that episode
in which president trump was accused of
suggesting drinking bleach
to fight the crotovirus which don't do
that
it would kill you but of course
he never said drinking and he never said
bleach he did say injecting
disinfectants in the context of
light as the disinfectant so
face the nation interestingly
when they when they asked the question
about this they actually framed it
correctly
i was not expecting that so face the
nation
actually couched the question as a
discussion about
light as a disinfectant
i think it's the first time i've seen it
have you seen anybody else correctly say
that he was talking about light
so so fascination gets it right
and they talk about light and they don't
say bleach they don't say drank
because none of those things happened in
any reality
so the first thing i'd like to say is
shout out to
face the nation you got you got
something wrong that
almost all the other news organizations
to this day
still get wrong so you know shout out to
you
so what does aaron rupar say about that
he said asked about trump's infamous
comments suggesting bleach injections
could be a treatment for coronavirus so
this is aaron rupar describing
what i just described except he refers
to it as suggesting bleach injections
which is not in the story right
berks tries to push back against the
notion
that she became an apologist blah blah
so then i tweeted i said face the nation
correctly describes trump's
disinfectant question to be about uv
light
and aaron rupar still buys into the
bleach hoax so i was trying to
call out to aaron rupar on twitter for
buying into the bleach
hoax and
this is the interesting thing the thing
that he pointed to
never mentioned bleach wasn't a word so
once i called him out and a lot of
people piled on
he defended himself and
he defended himself by retweeting an
article
that also did not have bleach in it
and also didn't have anything like that
in it so the
the cognitive dissonance you're gonna
have to see that if you go to my twitter
feed for uh
yesterday you'll see that exchange and
you'll see that even
after it's pointed out that there's
nothing in the video
that says anything about injecting
bleach he tweeted
the clip to me and said there you go
there's the thing proving that i'm right
and it's not in there he actually still
has
i think it's a hallucination that
there's something about bleach in there
because he and
much of the people on the left have been
told so often
that the president said bleach that he
thinks it's there on a
video clip that he he tweeted as
evidence
of his claim and it's just that word
isn't even there
so it's actually kind of amazing
to look at it when you can see how
clearly somebody can read
you know nothing about bleach and then
say look look
i just proved that he said something
about bleach it's freaky
it's actually freaky now if you do not
have a
background didn't say hypnosis and most
of you know
i do uh you would say i think there must
be some other explanation for this
like people can't just look at something
and actually
literally hallucinate the answer is yes
yes they can look at stuff and literally
see words that aren't there
that is a thing and it's easy and it's
common and it's almost universal it's
ubiquitous we're doing it all the time
we just don't know it
but when you see a clean example like
this where you say
give me the article that says bleach and
somebody says here it is
and it's not in it that'll freak you out
the first time you see it
after you see it enough you realize it's
the common way we operate
there's nothing wrong with let me say
this let me say this directly
there is nothing wrong with aaron
rupar's brain
nothing there's nothing wrong with his
brain there's nothing wrong with his
how much information he has there's
nothing wrong with the
level of knowledge he has
there's nothing wrong with his thinking
this is
normal that's the freaky part
the freaky part is that he's normal
completely normal
capable high functioning person in
society right
if you gave him an iq test he'd do great
if i checked his educational credentials
i haven't
but i imagine they'd be real good i
don't know but i imagine they would be
so if you think this is something about
somebody who's dumb
it isn't nothing to do with iq if you
think this this cognitive dissonance
thing is because somebody is
uninformed it's not
it's nothing to do with your
intelligence or how much information you
have
it is purely whether the thing you
believed comes in conflict with the
thing you
observe and when that happens you have
to paper them together with a
hallucination and this is this looks
like an example
now to be fair we can't know what he's
thinking
right it just looks like that could i be
wrong
sure
all right um the
most interesting thing that dr burke
said i guess she got kind of shut out
from talking to
trump for the last i don't know nine
months of his presidency or something
so that's not good um but he said she
said i saw the president presenting
graphs that i never made
so i know that someone was creating a
parallel set of data and graphics
that were shown to the president i don't
know to this day who
now i shouldn't laugh because it's it's
not good
but apparently the president had at
least two uh opposing sources of data
somebody saying fouchy but i don't think
i don't think it was dr fauci
somebody says to be fair vice president
pence was in charge of the task force
that's fair
that is a fair comment but still the
boss is the boss
i see some suggestions dr atlas
peter navarro people are suggesting but
they wouldn't be the source of the data
i mean ultimately they would you know if
anybody was passing along
they'd be passing along they wouldn't be
making it up
now what have we learned about data
if if president trump had used only
dr brooks's data what would be different
anything i don't know is dr burks's data
accurate i don't know how about the
alternative data
that trump used was the alternative data
better
or worse than what dr burks would have
presented
i don't know do you do you have any
reason to believe that dr burke's data
would be better
than whatever the other source was well
it depends what the other source was
right
no it doesn't it doesn't depend what the
other source is
because we live in a world in which all
data is unreliable
all of it dr burke's data would be
just as unreliable because almost
everything we've learned about the
coronavirus has been wrong
can you think of an ex counter example
almost
everything we've learned about the
coronavirus
has ended up being wrong
would dr burks have data would be which
would be the
the only exception to that i don't know
then here's the other thing you have to
take into account
if dr burks was passing along data
was that mean that she is the one who
originated the data
no and if she passed it along in a
certain context would it have
essentially a story or a narrative to it
would it be framed or filtered in a way
that it's not just the information
but it's what you say about the
information and what you compare it to
and
what context you put in right because
that's what makes your decision
so if dr burks
had done a good job of being the only
source of data
i'm not saying she didn't do a good job
but if she had been the only source of
data for the president would that
guarantee
or even give you high likelihood that
the president was getting good
clean actionable data and it was telling
him what to do
no nothing like that could have happened
i'm not saying nothing like that did
happen i'm saying it couldn't have
because the president has no way to see
science
he only has a way to see the people who
are talking to him about it
and they're not the ones who did the
science they're just talking about it
they're interpreting it they're putting
it in a context
are scientists the ones who always put
things in the right
context no no
they they have a you know if you looked
at all scientists
communication and statements and things
they've said in public
they have a bias too you can't be
unbiased it's not one of your choices
you don't get to say hey i think i'll be
unbiased today
you don't have that option even if
you're a scientist even if you're dr
berks
so a point which i say too often is
when people say hey trust the science
it's not really an
option to trust it because i don't have
access to it i don't i don't
know what any science is uh well as i
as a non-scientist and also even if i
had been a scientist
i probably didn't work on any specific
study that's in the news
so you're kind of trusting people you're
not trusting
science you might be trusting a process
but even the process of science goes
from
you know guesses to maybe to hypotheses
to
you know takes a long time to get to
fact and even then sometimes we change
our facts with new information
so this idea that there's this thing
called science
and all you have to do is pay attention
to it you're going to be fine
is so simplistic it's childlike
and we've been sold this idea that
science is like a
this magic thing and as wonderful as
science is
i think we're all pro science right is
there anybody who's against science
no the point is it's all filtered
through humans
so as long as you're filtering science
through human beings what you get
is human beings you don't get science
um when it comes out the other end it's
just what people told you
that you hope is compatible with science
and you hope the science is right but
those are a lot of ifs
that said we don't have a better process
i can't remember if i talked about this
yesterday
you ever have those situations where you
can't think you don't know if you
thought about talking about it
or you actually talked about it at
length and you don't and you can't
remember if you did
so stop me if i talked about this so
uh did you see the the interview with
rand paul and
george stephanopoulos and
it was interesting because
stephanopoulos was trying to get rand
paul
to say that the election there was no
fraud in the election
and rand paul instead
because he's smart would only say
we should we should look into the claims
of the elections irregularities and we
should have more transparency
now how do you argue against more
transparency
in an election what exactly is the
counter argument to that right
so rand paul is on completely solid
ground
i mean a solid the most solid ground you
could be
is that everybody wants the election to
be transparent
and fair and he's saying we're not there
we're not there and nobody else thinks
we're there either
really i mean you know at the very least
even if you think everything was fair at
the very least
you would like everyone else to believe
it too right
and we're not there so if we could get
everyone else to believe it's fair
that would be great and that's what rand
paul is asking for and why isn't that
reasonable
but stephanopoulos being a more of a
narrative guy than a news guy
uh is just insisting that
rand paul say in public that the
election was fair
but here's the problem and that the
reason that it was fair
is because all the court cases and the
challenges
uh failed now the problem is
this is a a national news
opinion kind of uh person stepping
office
so his his opinions and the things he
does in
on abc i guess would carry a lot of
weight
you know it gets a lot of attention etc
and he was actually going in front of
the world
and saying that an absence of proof is
proof of absence
the most common uh one of the most
common logical fallacies in the world
now what would happen if a major person
went on television and and made a claim
of um that the most logical
fallacy one of the most common logical
values that there ever is
that just because you don't have uh the
lack of evidence
is evidence that nothing happened it
just isn't a thing
it's it's completely irrational thinking
and because the public can't tell the
difference
the public generally is not educated
enough to know
what is a rational or logical
you know irrational thing they just
accept it
they go okay there's no proof so i guess
that's proof it was good
related to this speaking of that
so rudy giuliani finds out that dominion
voting system is suing him for
i guess over a billion dollars for
saying things that
was bad for business for dominion and
here's my question about that
now first of all i think dominion didn't
have much choice right
because their business did get really
really
hurt by all the news from you know
sidney powell and
et cetera
but is that something that you can sue
somebody for
well i don't know much about the law but
i'll tell you what
i do think in defamation suits
since you know i'm a public figure so i
end up dealing with this question a lot
my understanding is that defamation
suits you're going to have to prove
that the person intended to hurt you
or somehow knew that they were lying i
suppose
a defense for defamation is that you
thought it was true
because your free speech allows you to
say things that aren't true
as long as you believe they're true so i
think that's a complete defense is that
rudy believed it
now since lots of other people believed
it
it's pretty good defense right if you're
on the jury
and you saw rudy say you know i actually
thought it was true
and lots of people thought it was true
and here's why i thought it was true
and here's my sources i think i'd
believe he thought it was true
because i don't get a sense that he's
the kind of guy who would have taken
that case
unless he believed it was true it
doesn't feel like the sort of thing
based on his history and what we know
about him it doesn't seem like something
he would have done
as just a technique to just like make up
a
wild story uh defame some company that
would be
you know essential to our election
systems just to win the
you know win the day for trump i don't
feel that rudy is that guy
so if you put me on the jury how in the
world am i going to believe that he did
this
and if anything except believing it was
true
now should he have believed it was true
well
if you're talking about the venezuelan
stuff i told you from day one
that doesn't look true
can i if if you've been with me for a
while
can you uh in the comments can you maybe
confirm
that just on the surface of it i told
you it wasn't true
the moment i heard it i said whoa that
is a thing
that's exactly like something that's not
true
and and then of course we have not we've
got no confirmation of it
it feels like that's something that
could have been confirmed by now
if it had been true so i'll
i will take some credit for getting that
one right by the way i do plan to do
a report card on myself
to see how my predictions have been
let's say through the the trump era
because it would be a good time to do it
um and i don't know if i can
because i thought about it and i thought
okay the first problem i'm going to have
is i'm going to forget
all the times i was wrong right the most
normal thing you do you remember when
you're right you forget when you're
wrong
so i so being complete would be a
problem so i'd have to rely on the
the public to remind me what i said that
was wrong
but my um experience with that
is that when people remind me what i
predicted
that they say was wrong they always
remember it wrong
and if i go look back i said something
kind of different than that
so it's really hard to know what you
said
and then it's also hard to score them
because a number of things i might score
as an accurate prediction
that a totally reasonable person could
say i don't know i
i wouldn't score this as accurate so i
don't know how you could do it exactly
but i'm going to take it
i think i'll take a run at it with the
understanding that
it's more of an exercise than some kind
of accurate data
i think it's a good exercise you should
do it yourself you should you should
every now and then literally write down
what did you predict did you get it
right and then you would know
i see somebody saying that i score 7 out
of 10 correct
that's about what i would guess if i if
i had to guess where it would come out
i'd say something like 7 out of 10
and then further i would say that the
average person might get 5 and a 10
you know if you were to compare me to
just all citizens and pundits in general
i think 5 out of 10 would be the average
of most people and
i think i think i'm higher than that i'm
nowhere near 9 and a 10
but 7 out of 10 would be ridiculously
good
if i actually if it's actually seven and
ten
but we don't know that's why we'll check
by i'm sure that
i'm biased so i i may be giving myself
too much credit here we'll see
um so
here's my other question about rudy and
this lawsuit
and maybe i need a lawyer to answer this
for me
if dominion sues rudy for claims he made
about the voting system
being rigged and as far as i know
there's no
proof of such a thing would that give
rudy the ability to
look at their code and to
and to bring a case against them in the
process of defending himself or
will demanding to be smart enough to
limit
their claim to this one venezuelan thing
which they don't have to show their code
for that they can just say
show us any evidence that we have a
venezuelan connection
if you can't then that's defamation
or that that would be their argument it
would be defamation they still have to
prove intent i think
again i'm not a lawyer so check with
your lawyer
yeah so would the discovery phase
include
looking at the code if the thing they
were suing them for
didn't really involve the code because
the claims about
the venezuelan connection i don't
know that they would have to show the
code to defend that
so that would be interesting
if and i can't imagine that dominion
would have such bad
lawyers that they would put themselves
in the situation where if they had
something to hide
that it could be shown so i would say
it's probably a strong play from
dominion
to do this lawsuit because it especially
if there is some risk of discovery
because then it shows some confidence on
their side
i think they have to do that there's
there's no way around it they kind of
had to
they kind of had to sue him no matter
what they kind of had to do it for the
purpose of their business
so uh i don't like to live in a world
where everybody's suing everybody
but in this case they kind of had to do
it i feel like
and i'll be interested to see how that
comes out and if rudy gets
gets into their code they won't be happy
if that happens
i won't be happy just because it's
proprietary
so biden's already having some trouble
getting his relief
package passed i guess he's going to
delay it
and at this point don't you think that
it is a fair statement
that congress working on the impeachment
of trump after he's left office
is slowing down the essential business
of the country
we can say that for sure now right now
my understanding is that biden
wisely got the impeachment postponed
so he could get some other business done
first
now just to hold that thought in your
head
that biden thought that the congress
couldn't do the business of the country
and impeachment at the same time
congress agreed
and then delayed it for that reason
because they couldn't do the business of
the country
and the impeachment at the same time so
what happens when they when that delayed
impeachment happens and then they get to
the impeachment
have they not told the country that they
can't do their regular job at the same
time
they just told us that they told us that
in the clearest possible way
they said it directly we're not going to
do this now
because we won't be able to do the work
of the country
how's that going to change later later
when they do it it's still the work of
the country that they're
postponing right so every day that goes
by
that trump is out of office and remains
quiet
the trap gets deeper
and the trap is this congress has
admitted
that they can't do impeachment and the
work of the country
we saw arguably we saw during you know
january of 2020 when they were doing the
impeachment
when they should have been paying
attention to the coronavirus problem
so the longer you go when trump is
silent
ish and out of the job he becomes less
and less
important and what the congress would be
doing
might not even be constitutional to
impeach somebody
out of office probably won't succeed
because the senate you know is unlikely
to go that far
is a complete waste of time and they
tell you directly
they've actually told you that they
can't do their job while they're doing
this
and there's nothing good that can come
out of it for the country
nothing nothing good could come out of
it for the country
and yet they're going to do it and it's
on the schedule
we elected these people and they're
going to do something which even
they admit is not useful and they're
going to do it instead of useful work
and they're going to do it right in
front of you
are you freaking kidding me how much
more useless can you get that that's
like
all-time useless you know olympic
gold medal useless that's nobel prize
level
uselessness speaking of uselessness
as you know their democrats are lodged
ethics complaints against ted cruz and
josh hawley for their role in what they
say
is uh i don't know according to the
democrats overthrowing the country or
something like that
their complaint is so stupid that i
won't even describe it but i will tell
you that
josh hawley decided to respond by filing
an ethics complaint against the people
who filed an ethics complaint against
him
so i finally figured out why congress
has more than one person
uh you've heard the joke about the let's
see the
the airplane that is so sophisticated
and that
uh it practically flies itself and all
you need to fly it
this highly sophisticated airplane is
one pilot and one dog that's all you
need
the dog is there to make sure the pilot
doesn't touch any of the buttons
because the thing flies itself and if
the pilot touches anything he can only
make it worse
so the dog is there just to bite the
pilot so he doesn't do anything
well that's what congress has become
like
so i think the only reason there's more
than one person in congress
is so the other person can sue them or
not sue them but
impeach them or do an ethics
complaint against them if you only had
one person
who would file an ethics complaint
against that person but yeah if you have
two
they can file ethics complaints against
each other
and they can impeach each other so you
need at least two people in congress
i learned today because you can't really
reach
the full limit of thorough worthlessness
until you're spending all of your time
on impeachment
and ethics complaints against each other
now here's the good part you would think
to yourself
an ethics complaint wow
an ethics complaint that would be
something that would involve a violation
of let's say
ethics to pick you know an obvious
example
so what would be the ethical violation
that josh hawley is being accused of
well he's being accused of objecting to
the electoral vote through
a completely legal process that
democrats have used in the past
multiple times with no problem
whatsoever
that's considered an ethics complaint
so he has bad ethics for doing what is
completely within the rules
and it's within the rules because the
rules were written specifically to put
that in there
it's not it's not accidentally within
the rules
they wrote the rules to put it in there
it's not a josh hawley didn't use a
technicality he used the law exactly as
written for the purpose it was written
for the reason it's been used before
by the democrats routinely everything
completely legal normal
and in fact i would say desirable and
that's an ethics complaint
and so that's his argument his argument
is if you're bringing up an ethics
complaint
for doing something that routine i mean
completely routine
then i will bring up an ethics complaint
against you for bringing up an ethics
complaint about me
that doesn't have any backing to it
completely acceptable i always say that
josh
josh hawley has a completely acceptable
argument
that they are wasting time and being
unethical
it's a good argument but they don't have
any argument against him
what case would they make would they say
it was unethical every time we
did it no this is what they'll say
they'll say the election was not stolen
and by the way you've seen that cnn is
calling this the big lie
with a capital b and a capital l so talk
about the election
being stolen is described by uh the
pundits now
the anti-trump pundits as being the
quote the big lie
which makes it sound sort of sort of
nazi-ish right
which is why they do it so uh
the the fact that the mainstream media
has basically formed a narrative
around a a logical
problem let's say an illogical truth
is amazing that they sold it the
illogical truth
is that a lack of proof is proof that
there's nothing there completely
irrational
and they call it the big lie if you to
believe that
a computer system could be hacked think
about that
think about the fact that the
idea that a that a software
system could be vulnerable to hacking
that that idea which is the most common
thing we see we see it with a
i mean it's literally the headline that
some of our secure systems
get hacked all the time but to believe
that it happened in this particular case
would be a big lie
when you live in a in a world in which
this level
of uh propaganda is just common
uh it's it's just shocking and
the thing that the only thing i think is
who are these 18 percent of republicans
who still trust the media
how in the world could you still trust
the media in a world like this
where they're using a you know illogical
thought
and calling it the big lie
basically if you if you agree with logic
you bought into the big lie and that's
the narrative
and they actually sold this to most of
the public amazing
all right um
the funniest thing is watching the uh
people on the left tear each other apart
i was just reading an article
now bill maher who of course
had been i'd say taking common cause
with all
anti-trumpers for the last four years
but now that trump is a little bit off
the stage
um now now the left has turned on bill
maher
and i'm looking at the things that
they're accusing him of
and they are ridiculous so one of the
accusations
is that he used the n word now when you
read that in the story without
context what do you think about it
well you think well maybe that's pretty
bad
are you kidding me he used the n-word
wow i guess we have to hate him for that
and by the way i hate that word so if he
if anybody had used that word and let's
say it's
native offensive way then i'd have some
bad feelings about it
but that's not the context that he used
the word
he used the word in talking about the
word i believe i believe his context was
talking about it
or quoting somebody else or one of those
contexts he certainly was
not using it as just a word
right he was using it in a context about
the word i i remember
i remember reading about it but whatever
it was it was completely
more of a free speech thing he was just
expressing his
freedom to say the word in the in a
non-insulting context
but i guess he's not allowed to do that
are you allowed not are you allowed to
be non-insulting
and completely respectful and just use a
word
and talk about the word you can't do
that seriously
now i'm not the guy who
needs to or defends bill maher's opinion
because i've disagreed with him as much
as i've agreed with him probably
but come on going after him for this
is just completely it's completely
unacceptable
so uh by watching the the left
no longer have a common enemy and then
turn on each other
it was predictable the most predictable
outcome
is that this wokeness is going to take
so many people out in the left that
they're going to rethink it
and you're seeing that happen now bill
maher's kind of a special case because
uh i um you know he may lean
closer to progressive and stuff but i
think he's an independent thinker
and he would go where the goer you know
he could go wherever he wanted
on an opinion
all right
they're eating their own that's right so
you're seeing now a number of cases
where
businesses have decided that they'd like
to
in the words of michael jordan uh he
would say
you know republicans buy sneakers too so
my
my favorite was the yeah the katie
couric one where she was gonna
i think she's still going to host
jeopardy
and made some comments you know
anti-republican
conservative comments and her employer
said uh
they watch the show we'd like them to
keep watching the show
so i don't know if they cancelled her
i would imagine probably not but it's
the kind of pressure that you're seeing
and i i told i've been telling you for a
while that unless there is
uh mutually assured destruction
that the wokeness thing you know will
just go forever until
we're all dead but of course there will
be there there always
emerges a counter force so the reason
that things do not become a slippery
slope
forever is because the counter force
almost always is going to
pop up and the counter force seems to be
this
the moment somebody
insults conservatives in public
conservatives stop buying their stuff
like
immediately right and every time you see
it happen
you don't need too many examples of it
right you just need a few examples
where somebody who is let's say
associated with a big company
insulted a third of the public you know
the let's say the republicans
and and their and their ceo fired them
or the board of directors removed them
or or they lost their job or something
you don't need to see too many examples
of that
before you know you shouldn't do it
right so the the attacks we're seeing
against republicans
if you're worried that it turns into a
full civil war
um economics will stop it
and you're seeing it happen now the free
market
just stepped in and said whoa whoa
politics is great
politics is great but get that out
of here
so the free market basically just became
the police
the free market just said yeah you know
you can
you can do all these political things
that
um are terrible
but uh it's going to cost you
it's going to cost you more than you
want to pay and it's going to cost you
fast you're going to get fired that day
so that's where we needed to be
um yeah somebody mentioned mike lindell
the the my pillow guy
that's a special case because the
in the case of mike lindell he did wrap
himself around the president
pretty closely he got he got really into
the politics
that's different from just saying
something in a tweet
right so he took it to kind of another
level
but i don't think his pillows should pay
for that
i don't think his employees should have
you know less work
because he he got he got politically
involved
so it's terribly unfair but we live in a
world where
if you are if you started a company and
you get into politics it's going to cost
you
unfortunately so i hope he's okay with
that
uh his pillows are are excellent
in case you wondered um
this what's his what is a scotty vest
somebody's asking me a question but i
don't understand it
all right don't buy ben and jerry's blah
blah
well i don't know how many republicans
it would take
to boycott something but
it doesn't take much right it wouldn't
take much if
you know if 10 percent of republicans
just immediately stopped buying
something
i think any big company would say that's
a big enough number that we need to fix
this
so it doesn't have to be a gigantic
number
as long as they can see it on the bottom
line they're going to have to fix it
the scotty vest is a travel vest with
lots of products oh yeah i've seen that
i have to i have to admit i've wanted it
if you travel
by plane and i know that's hard these
days i want a thing where all of my
items that i need
go into some kind of a long case
that that unrolls and i could just hold
it up and it goes
you know like an accordion i could take
out the pieces i want and put them back
in
you know your phone your your
boarding ticket and stuff
um have you tried to watch
a hollywood movie lately i mean there
aren't that many new ones but
oh my god they're bad i
i don't know how anybody can watch a
movie anymore
i still like documentaries but regular
movies are like
god they're so boring now and they hurt
you your typical movie plot
something bad has to happen to somebody
in the beginning so that you've got a
plot for a movie i hate
watching fictional content in which
something really bad happens to somebody
because then that gets in your head and
even if it has a happy ending
the bad part's still there
i just don't want to watch content where
i watch bad things happening to people
as part of my entertainment
that's just sick in an entertainment i'd
rather you know
not um
you're rediscovering old ones yeah
that's exactly what i'm doing
i i find i'm rediscovering uh like old
movies
and uh in i don't know if you're having
this
experience but i find that youtube is
the
about the only form of entertainment
that i can handle these days and the
reason is
that you can watch you know unlimited
seems unlimited
number of short form content
so that you don't have to commit to a
three hour movie
and you get like a nice little hit of
dopamine or something you like into that
half hour it could be even five minutes
and
i would rather watch a whole bunch of
youtube
clips and they're pretty good at
suggesting what the next clip would be
uh than any any kind of scripted
anything
um so politico is reporting that biden
has trouble
remembering his speech stuff yeah
i'll tell you everybody who thought i
was going to have
a bad time after trump left office my
critics were
mockingly telling me how unhappy i must
be
and i kept thinking to myself no i have
a preference
i had a preference but i'm not really
feeling unhappy
i'm actually feeling surprisingly
relieved
honestly um i
i you know i told you a long time ago
that i thought
maybe trauma should be a one-term
president in a positive way
the positive way is that he's such a
disrupter that
sometimes you need the disruption and i
feel like
a lot of the disruption he brought was
entirely good
um but you can't have that much
disruption forever
you you need a period of calm and then
maybe you get a little disruption later
after you've had calm for a while
that would be the ideal pattern for a
country and so i liked him as fitting
into that pattern better than
anybody ever has as a disrupter but you
just can't do the disruption forever
that it pulls the fabric of your country
apart and we saw that
but i appreciate all the good that came
out of it but we have to
we have to accept i mean i think you
have to be an adult about it
and accept that it wasn't all good
um
yeah we'll see how long uh biden stays
in in the office before
kamal harris takes over here's something
i'm expecting but we haven't seen yet
um maybe you can help me if it has
happened and i don't know about it
there is a there's a bit of a let's say
a tradition
in which the vice president takes on
some specific
portfolio so in the case of al gore
he was in charge of re-engineering
government
to make it more efficient you know
automating things and getting websites
for things and
and all that and by all accounts he did
a tremendous job by the way
true story al gore um
if you haven't heard this story it's
worth telling you so years ago
um i got invited into the white house
uh during the clinton administration and
i was getting a behind-the-scenes tour
uh of the uh the facility apparently
some of the
writers who worked for uh the
speechwriters for
gore um were familiar with some of my my
work and we
had some contact so when i was in town
for something else
they said hey stop by and we'll give you
a tour of the
the uh the white house so while i'm in
the white house
um the vice president at the time al
gore heard i was in the building
and he knew of me in fact i think he had
a dilbert cartoon on his wall
um in fact i knew he did yeah because i
was asked for it and i gave it to him
so he and he
asked me to help out communicating what
he'd done
for re-engineering the government which
apparently was quite good
so i declined i declined helping because
i was the wrong person for that but i
did
hook him up with somebody who did a good
job who was the right person for that
so vice presidents often have a
portfolio
like that do you see mike pence in
charge of the coronavirus etc
what will kamala harris's portfolio be
or will she have one this is what i'd be
looking for
if you see kamala harris get a portfolio
that feels like
a sort of a make work
kind of a thing something like what
al gore had well that wasn't make work
let me come up with a much better word
for that not make work
but rather let's say something that's
important
but not sexy so what al gore was doing
was
super important making government more
efficient really important
but not sexy which is why he asked me to
help him with the communication because
it was just so dry and boring
and even the coronavirus that's really
important
but i don't know task force it just
doesn't seem like a sexy job
so will kamal harris have some kind of a
special job that doesn't look like the
highest priority in the country
necessarily although i guess the coveted
task force might be
or will they leave her a generalist
because what i'd be looking for is if
they leave her as a generalist
meaning she doesn't have a specific
portfolio
i feel like they're getting ready for
her to take over
you know to take the top job whereas if
they say hey you're going to work on
this
special project i feel like that would
be people signaling
that it's not imminent that she needs
this other thing to
like build up her resume you know have a
little
accomplishment as a vice president
so that i would look to that as like a
little signal
of how they're thinking internally about
where she's going
she'll be in charge of making government
more woke somebody says
you know uh i still see see people
doing the uh you know calling her
heels up harris and referring to her
uh let's say her best in which willie
brown was a
you know i guess they've admitted that
she that he helped her politically
and they were lovers or whatever i don't
think any of that matters
and i think that if you think that
saying that stuff somehow
denigrates her or helps your team
i would just leave that alone it just
doesn't have any persuasive power
and it doesn't it's not a good look
if that's the stuff you care about it's
not it doesn't
it doesn't make you look good as a
person who's commenting
if if what you care about is her sex
life 20 years ago
however she got there she got there
right everybody who got where they got
had some luck maybe did some weasley
things
you know maybe his chance you know
everybody got there the way they got
there and
uh it's just this is not relevant
and i also think it's super sexist um
so there's that uh
evangelicals are powerless now somebody
says it
do you think so evangelicals are
powerless now
well the person is not in power that's
for sure
what's harris's weakness then her
weakness
well i think her weakness is her
personality actually i hate to say it
but she has that thing where she laughs
at her own jokes too hard and that's
she just needs to work on that in my
opinion but
hey she she got all the way to where she
is so maybe she doesn't need to do
anything i
i recommend somebody says i successfully
used my attractiveness in business
without regret
why wouldn't you everybody should use
whatever tools they have right
um so somebody says it's not sexist
because they
made fun of john kerry for marrying into
uh
and to catch up money um yeah i'm not
sure those are exactly the same but i
take your point
um does not debate well blah blah all
right i don't have much else to talk
about
so let me just show you what it looks
like outdoors
i'll be going out in that in a minute
and uh
it's pretty darn nice
that's all for now and i will talk to
you tomorrow
