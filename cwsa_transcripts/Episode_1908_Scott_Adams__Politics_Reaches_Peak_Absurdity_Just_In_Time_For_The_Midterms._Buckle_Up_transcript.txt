probably the best thing that's ever
happened to anybody ever anywhere
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
yeah hard to believe but it's possible
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker Chelsea's Diner canteen drug
or flaska vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamines
of the day that makes everything better
it's cold
the simultaneous sympathy happens now
go
this is the highlight of civilization
yeah civilization turns out the bar
wasn't that high
that was the surprising part
well I'd like to start out with the uh
most interesting story I just saw before
I came on here at the University of
Maryland
they've developed a sweatshirt
that acts as an invisibility cloak
against AI
so if you're worried that the AI will
recognize you facial recognition they've
developed a sweatshirt
that it looks like the technique has but
like crowd faces in it or something but
whatever it does it confuses the AI and
they they showed a live demonstration of
the AI just became invisible or the
person became invisible so they
literally
literally have developed a cloak of
invisibility for AI
it's an actual thing and it works
that's why I say it's about time it's
about time
get that AI cloak
some of you may have watched my live
stream yesterday afternoon a special
live stream in which I demonstrated how
a senior citizen me
gets a health care appointment through
their health care provider Kaiser
Permanente North
if you think I ever got to talk to a
doctor or got a doctor appointment you'd
be wrong
because I I demonstrated how difficult
it would be just to work through the
system of just getting an appointment
and it wasn't until this morning I
realized that the problem is
that the entire system is designed to
prevent you from getting a doctor
appointment
literally
literally not a joke because that's the
only way they can handle it economically
they need to take all the people who
were marginal doctor requests and really
should have been handled in some other
way and they they shunt them off
so it's all about preventing you from
getting to a doctor and the trouble is
they got a little too good at it
I actually can't figure out how to get
to a doctor
right now it's not that I don't know the
method is that the method breaks for
different reasons
because of the complexity so when you
reach a certain level of complexity
and then you say okay you've seen your
citizen go figure out which of these
five apps and uh yeah five apps if you
count websites so the three websites two
apps
a phone system that gets you to a person
who gets you to a person who gets you to
a person
and I actually couldn't solve it and
I've tried several times I can't get
through the system to get anything done
really
so it's totally broken and I I don't
think it's really necessarily just a
problem with the Kaiser system which
does seem completely broken at this
point but it seems like a problem with
complexity
I feel like everything just had a
creeping complexity until the point
where it's just too hard to do anything
just like and let me give you another
example
uh I I now have I think five streaming
services
because during the pandemic I was like
desperate for any kind of entertainment
at home so I just signed up for five of
them thinking I'll keep the ones I like
and so now instead of sitting down and
watching a show for entertainment
if I've like allocated an hour or
something
the whole hour is just looking for a
show
because now that there's so many of them
I can't decide that the one I found is
as good as the one I haven't found yet
so I'm in a continuous state of looking
for the good one and at the end of the
hour I've watched no TV
and it happens every time
close to every time 95 of the time very
rarely do I actually watch a show
very rarely the exceptions are sometimes
there'll be a game on and like I'll say
oh there's a game and I'll turn it on
and then it'll go to commercial
and I'll say well that would have worked
except that I can't possibly sit here
for a whole commercial that's not gonna
happen so I turn it off look for
something else
uh
anyway so everything's too complicated
though
um
Twitter let's give you a little Twitter
update here are some things that are
rumored but I don't know if they're true
rumored that the Twitter deal with musk
buying it might close on Friday
well I don't know if that's true but it
looks like it's going to close so that's
good I heard a rumor that I do not have
confidence and that musk plans to be CEO
of Twitter as well
did anybody hear that from a credible
source
anybody
yeah I don't I don't I don't think
that's going to happen
I can imagine it happening temporarily
like I can imagine for a month or
something but it doesn't really sound
like
the thing that's going to happen
and then I thought to myself
if you were going to pick a CEO for
Twitter
who would you pick
about it
who would you pick that could actually
do it in a way that you would Jack
Dorsey somebody says you know you know I
think people are going to miss Jack
Dorsey
yeah not me uh I would not be a good
leader you know I am not a good leader
I've told you this before does anybody
remember why I'm a I would be a terrible
manager or CEO and I've been those jobs
and I'm not good at it
it's be yeah I have too much empathy
you you have to be able to abuse your
employees more than they want to be
abused or you're not a good manager
I mean that the tension between what the
employees want and what the company
wants is what you're managing
so you're supposed to manage them to the
maximum amount of unhappiness that gets
you the maximum amount of productivity
and I I can't I can't wrap my head
around that I'm glad that people can
because it doesn't make the system work
I just I just can't bring myself to that
space I need a job where everybody wins
as much as possible right if you read a
joke
and you laugh everybody wins
um
so Twitter put together a number of
employees they put together some demands
because they're worried about losing
their jobs and worried about what
Twitter might become under Elon Musk and
so they've among other things they've
asked in their letter
that musk quote not discriminate against
workers on the basis of their political
beliefs
yeah the employees of Twitter are
worried that somebody would discriminate
against them based on their political
beliefs
um this leads me into
what I'm going to call the theme for the
rest of the live stream
don't you love it when I have a theme
I have a theme today and it was
accidental it's an accidental theme
because the news just created the theme
and here's the theme
we've reached
Peak absurdity
and by we I mean the Democrats
Democrats have reached Peak absurdity
like it couldn't be any weirder
nothing could be funnier or more
clownish
than the Twitter employees worried that
somebody would treat them as political
entities instead of just you know
citizens of America
huh
I'd hate to see that happen
um
so there it is peak absurdity
I know I
so who would you put who would you put
in a CEO let's say you were Elon Musk
who would you put in the CEO
they'll either make everybody happy or
alternately everybody unhappy because
you end up in the same place
you don't want people to be too happy
yay
now well that's interesting yay just
bought parlor so that's not gonna happen
Lex he's busy
all right I'm going to throw out a name
just
just for fun
you ready for this Mike cernovich
the whole world would explode
every employee would quit
but he is one of the few people I would
trust
to be balanced
you know I would actually trust sirovich
not to
um limit people's freedom of speech
and that's all you want I mean that's
all you want you want somebody that you
would trust to not limit somebody's
freedom of speech
and then you know I'm sure the rest of
the people could make the you know make
it profitable and all that stuff
but you do need somebody you can trust
on that one that one freedom of speech
thing and I couldn't I couldn't
immediately think of somebody else
because everybody else is either so uh
overtly political
and even though cernovich is political
he's political in a whatever makes sense
way not in a I'm a republican to death
way
nothing like that
Mark Cuban
yeah he's busy yeah I don't think Mark
Cuban wants to see your job
yeah yeah
interesting thought experiment
um it'll be somebody you've never heard
of probably
so uh
Fox News is uh Geraldo Rivera
he has an idea that George Floyd is the
uh the person most responsible for the
failure of the democratic party not
because of what George Floyd did
specifically but you know he became the
focus of attention and the focus on that
heralda wants to call as maybe the you
know the the turning point now I don't
know that that I wouldn't go so far as
to say it was the cause
I don't I don't think George Floyd was a
cause of things that happened not
directly related to George Floyd
but on the other hand I do think it
marks a the beginning of the top
don't you
it feels like the the beginning of the
absurdity started them
where people had the best intentions I
think I think actually most people had
good intentions one way or the other
about George Floyd they wanted the right
answer
I think I mean I felt like everybody
just wanted the right answer in that one
and they weren't quite sure what it
would be
but
because I do think it might have been a
coincidental marker of the beginning of
something that got worse
um cat Abu
Twitter user
uh reports that also about Geraldo
noted that Heraldo mentioned that cops
are quote besieged and quote under
attack because more than 250 cops have
been shot this year in the line of duty
doesn't that seem like a lot
like in my mind if you would ask me
and I guess it's a higher number than
before but if you ask me in the whole
country of you know 350 million whatever
we are now how many cops are shot in the
line of duty per year what would you
have guessed
just if you didn't know the number what
would you oh you would have guessed a
thousand
some people say 150 yeah I would have
guessed 50 to 100
which is you know outrageous
but 250 that does sound like
it's funny that we would even have any
sense of when it's too high
how do I even have any idea what's the
right number for that in in a normal
world there's but somehow I still have
that sense I have this weird sense that
it's too high I mean one would be too
high but
I don't know it's it's weird that I have
a sense of what's right without knowing
what's standard I'm comparing it to
that that just shows the limits of our
rational Minds
um but as Kat Abu mentioned when Geraldo
said 250 cops have been shot in the line
after duty this year Kat says what he
didn't mention was that 804 people have
been shot and killed by police this year
as well
so
um no I didn't realize it was a
competition
but apparently we're scoring it as a
competition and it's cops uh 804 and
citizens 250.
so so far the cops are winning
um
shooting more citizens and the citizens
are shooting cops
uh now as somebody pointed out probably
all 804 of those people were shot by
police were criminals
[Laughter]
some of them might have been a little
bit innocent
Maybe
a few of them were innocent
but I'm not sure you could compare the
number of police officers enforcing the
law killed to the number of people
breaking the law killed it feels like
that's the wrong comparison
have I ever mentioned to you that the
difference between people are good at
analysis versus bad
is if they know what to compare
that's the one thing that always divides
the good from good comparers to the bad
comparers is what did you compare it to
you and I wouldn't compare those two
numbers
uh Michael schellenberger had a
provocative tweet that involved a
psychologist Sam vacton who studies
narcissism
and he says that the potential for
aggression and victimhood
movements is much larger than in the
general population so in other words if
you're part of a movement that says we
are victims stop doing bad things to us
you're more likely to turn into a
violent movement than somebody who just
you know wants different policies I
guess
now that makes sense doesn't it
the the victims are the ones who are
going to be the most energetic about
changing things and usually you have to
get violent to change anything big
unfortunately so that kind of makes
sense so would you say by this measure
that the
um the Democrats are more likely to be
violent or the Republicans
if this hypothesis holds that the the
victimhood people are the more dangerous
who is more dangerous
really
now just
just check your first answer the The
Reflex answer
your first your first first answer is
the other side right whoever's the other
side so your first answer is definitely
Democrats it's all the wokeness right
the wokeness is basically about
victimhood right
now tell me what has been the main
message of the Republicans lately
that all the wokeness is making victims
of the Republicans
the Republicans have a total victimhood
policy as well they don't express it the
same way it's a different kind of
victimhood but it you know and the and
the Republicans are saying uh their
biggest issue is stop killing babies
stop killing babies right stop uh stop
hunting I'm responsible for that being a
meme hashtag Hunted
yeah the Republicans definitely feel
like victims definitely
but
is one of the more more victim than the
other
what do you think
I know so it probably has to do with how
you feel as much as what you say or more
I guess
so I'm not sure that standard is as
useful as it should be because you
always think the other side is the one
that's complaining and you think your
side is making good points
but the other side is just being victim
of complainers do you do you know what
the left says about the right
the left says about the right that the
right is complaining too much and acting
like victims
and I I don't know I don't know how to
compare
so how would you compare those two
things I don't know
I I have no idea how you compare those
and decide who's the bigger victimhood
person but I can tell you it's a bad
idea to have victim that is your primary
brand
so much so that I will make the
following predictions sort of a generic
prediction
the someday a republican will run
against victimhood
but has to be in favor of something
so against victimhood as an organizing
principle
say let's not use victimhood
as the basis for all of our uh policies
instead let's use uh engineered
solutions that can be tested for
effectiveness
so imagine anybody it doesn't matter it
doesn't have to be a republican but
imagine anybody saying all right
uh here's the deal I'm against
victimhood as an organizing principal
foreign
go ahead and complain because we'd like
to hear your complaints so free speech
you know squeaky wheel that's all good
complain as much as you want but don't
use the victimhood as the basis for
policy
the victim of his for the victims to
complain and make sure we know what's
happening so we can incorporate it but
it's not it shouldn't be the main
operating principle the main operating
principle should be what works
and do you have a way to test it first
now how would that person lose an
election
think about it
because you're allowing the victimhood
to
you know be fully fully expressed you're
not saying stop saying that you're just
saying don't use that as the basis for
decision making
your decision making should be based on
what works and that should be tested
whenever you could test this model
it just sounds like one person is a
smart operator and the other one's just
a Winer
so your your comparison again it's all
about comparison the person who said you
should test it and just do what works is
going to win that every time unless they
have some other gigantic negative
following around
I say it again winning uh winning a
national office could not be easier it's
just nobody's doing the obvious thing it
would take the winner they all just
revert to their team because probably
that's the only way they get funding I
guess
um
so
um
I I saw a uh something that I read wrong
somebody in their profile said they were
working on uh anti-effectives
and I I think it was in a medical sense
or some kind of medical term there and I
thought it would be interesting for
somebody to run against ineffectiveness
just say I don't care if you're left or
right
don't do things you know won't work
so I'm against ineffectiveness I'm
neither a republican nor a Democrat I'm
against things that don't work
how would the public like that
and say well you can be a Democrat and
you can be a Republican and I respect
both of those choices but I'm only going
to be for what works
so if we can't prove it works I'm not
for it it doesn't matter whose side it
came from
and you could pick a team you could say
that you're you're you know
we'll let you go away Robert since you
seem like sort of an
all right
um
here's another indication that we've
reached Peak absurdity uh Wall Street
Journal had a little piece yesterday uh
noting this was an opinion piece but
that the ESG bubble is deflating now do
you think somebody could print
in the Wall Street Journal
without any correction that the ESG
bubble is deflating
now I'd say that's right on schedule
what did I promise you about ESG do you
remember what I promised
I said I said I would uh I would destroy
his reputation before the end of this
year
and now the Wall Street Journal is
publishing
that the ESG bubble is deflating
there's another article that I tweeted
around where somebody noted all of my
ESG comics in in Dilbert
and said you're in bad shape if Dilbert
is mocking your thing
noted BlackRock
so
um if you look at my Twitter feed I've
got a link to uh
all of the ESG related
comics and if you like
um they're all licensable you know
there's a link on there for buying it or
licensing it if you want to use it for
your own purposes
if you use it for your own purposes
without legally licensing it
just make sure you're an individual not
a corporate entity right if you're just
doing it with your friends that's fine
yeah I don't care about I don't care
about copyright if you're forwarding to
your friends or tweeting it you know if
you're just an individual but don't do
it in a corporate way that would require
a license don't do it under corporate
entity
um
so that is my uh
my gift to you I hope it helps
all right here are the things that seem
the most absurd so ESG seems to be
deflating so I think ESG has reached
Peak absurdity true or false has ESG
apparently reached Peak absurdity I say
yes
because people now can out loud they can
criticize it right
uh how about trans athletes
so there's a story uh and of uh which
Carolina north or south
uh about a trans athlete a volleyball
player
who is apparently so powerful that
people are being
injured where the hell is that now there
it is a North Carolina School District
voted last month to forfeit all high
school volleyball games against a rival
school because the Rival school has a
transgender Athlete on the female team
who apparently is really talented
relative to the other players and a
little bit stronger than maybe they
expected
so they're apparently yeah apparently
the uh trans athlete spiked the ball so
hard into the face of an opponent that
the opponent had some injuries which
could be kind of bad I mean the head and
neck that could be pretty bad
does it say about it is but I think this
is the way this will be settled I think
that trans athletes will be allowed to
join teams
that that's the current situation for
the most part but that the teams who
would be scheduled to play against them
will just forfeit
and I think that that's how this will be
handled
now what would happen if every time
somebody joined your team you didn't
have anybody to play
because the teams that cancel uh they
canceled for safety
and if you cancel for safety
nobody can touch you nobody can touch
you
the the schools that canceled for safety
are completely safe because they did it
for a specific reason it was based on
evidence it was an evidence-based
decision
so I think that's the way it's going to
go I think that the freedom of the trans
athletes and by the way if you're new to
me I've always supported the trans
athletes because I think that the the
athletic world needs to be reconfigured
for a variety of reasons not just for
the trans
it sporting is an elite
um
highly uh
harmful process for some people
meaning that the superstars who were
born with genetic gifts we treat as
Heroes and they get all the girls and
the boys and everything else and the
people who are not athletic don't get
any benefits from athletic
organizations
and probably only the top maybe 10
percent are good enough athletes to be
on a team and get all the goodness now
if you're good enough to be on a team
and actually play as opposed to sitting
on the bench
it's amazing I'm very in favor of
organized Sports
see this is this is where the I always
see this NPC comment that Scott is not
athletic and therefore he does not
understand
athleticism I've played every
sport you could imagine when I was a kid
I was playing I would play five sports a
day literally five different organized
Sports a day and that was just normal
you know you do one at lunch one at
recess one after school you know one
with you you'd play catch with your
brother you'd have a pickup game you'd
have five sports a day you do every one
right and that was sort of not even that
untypical when I grew up I I feel as if
you might be young
if you're imagining that I was
non-athletic because when I grew up
there weren't any well I won't say any
90 of boys
were athletic and played all the sports
typically
but today kids might play one sport
right it's really different but if
you're looking at somebody my age and
you say that they didn't participate in
sports you're almost always wrong
almost all males my age played every
sport
you know I'm exaggerating a little bit
but you get the idea
so no that's not it my my uh my opinion
is based on this I've played co-ed
Sports
so co-ed soccer and co-ed tennis
and the co-ed
um soccer and the co-ed tennis were
really really fun
really really fun all you have to do is
make sure that the tennis player you're
playing is about the same level
or you know can can hang with you and
make sure that the soccer players are
not that not that different
so the female soccer players tended to
be the ones who could run
you know when I had a co-ed
um I had a co-ed soccer team as an adult
in my 50s and the women that I recruited
ended up being like college soccer
players they had been and they were
current marathon runners
so I just sort of accidentally recruited
a whole bunch of marathon running women
and many of them played in college and
so suddenly we had this Powerhouse
soccer team you know you couldn't have
uh yeah you had to have mixed you
couldn't play just all men on the field
and it was really really fun
right so
while I do think there's a place for you
know every kind of combination of sports
I think what we need more of
is the Just For Fun sports where
everybody's
everybody just plays people of their
relevant relative ability
yeah
you weren't competing for scholarships
though yes and the the competing for
scholarships is a terrible terrible
process
yeah I think that competing for
scholarships is awesome for the one
percent of people can get them
so for them it's great for the rest of
us it's just we're paying money for your
kid
why am I paying money for your kid
right if my kid isn't as athlete but the
you know the college or whatever that he
that that kid goes to
pays a lot of money for athletics
and maybe it doesn't you know make money
for them depending on the school
why am I why am I subsidizing your child
why is that right
now I'm completely okay with your child
excelling in sports and doing great but
do you think I should pay for it that's
the only question like I want your kid
to have every opportunity and do
everything that they want to do I want
just as much for your kid as you do
I'm just asking you should I subsidize
it
or should you subsidize my kid
who's got more problems because they are
not good at sports
now it's a it's a weird situation
but we have reached peak absurdity in
that I think we've reached Peak
absurdity with both phetamine and Biden
we'll talk about Federal a little bit
more but don't you think that the fact
that fetterman and Biden are both
legitimate Democrat candidates
that is peak absurdity and I don't mean
to be unkind for the differently abled
it's not about that right anybody who
wants to paint me with that brush good
luck it's not about that right yeah if
federmen were blind do you think we'd be
having this conversation no
if fetterman had one leg do you think
we'd be having this conversation no and
everybody knows that everybody knows
that and and watching the Democrats
argue that everything's fine with both
Biden and Federman you do you do you
feel that that is Peak yeah right
nobody's saying that Crenshaw can't do
the job so is
um have we not reached Peak absurdity
would you agree that I'm calling the top
the fact that Federman invited are both
considered legitimate candidates
forget about their politics
I'm not talking about any of their
policy preferences
it's not even about that but the fact
that we're seriously considering both of
those people it's insane
all right and also the Ukraine situation
seems to be reaching some kind of
absurdity like the the bottomless pit
all right let's
um
um so here's some more absurdity
don't you think that the Democrat
policies on covet or have now reached
Peak absurdity
would you agree with that call
the the people wearing masks Outdoors by
themselves
you know the the still requirements for
for things yeah I mean almost everything
energy policy energy policy clearly has
reached Peak absurdity
yeah and but correct me if I'm wrong
all of these things are sort of
coincidentally reaching yeah Dei they're
all reaching uh CRT they're always in
Peak absurdity right before the midterms
is that a weird coincidence
that the absurdity is happening all at
the same time
because it correct Am I Wrong give me
give me a give me a reasonableness check
here now I'm going not on any data I'm
going entirely upon just what it feels
like if you read the news every day what
it feels like is all of those things
that when they first came out
they sounded a little sketchy to you
but you were never sure how big they
would get right
you didn't know how big anything would
get so when things were little and sort
of squirrely
you ignored them well it's squirrely was
kind of small and then it just kept
getting bigger and bigger and bigger
until
the trans stuff couldn't get any more
than whatever it is would you agree
there's nothing more
is there now I'm not arguing what's good
or bad about it I'm just saying we've
we've got to the limit of more there's
nothing more
right so that's the peak if you think
it's absurd then it's pre-conserted if
you think it's all good it's reached the
peak goodness I guess that would be the
other View
all right uh let's talk about uh the
progressives
um there was this
brief Shining Moment yesterday
when uh I think it was a
I saw a tweet saying uh that the
progressives were going to be anti-war
for Ukraine similar to some of the
right-wing people and that maybe for the
first time and this was really really
unusual and special it could be that the
far left and the far right would agree
on the anti-war they would come together
they would fix something that was
important through their you know their
being on the same side and for a while I
thought to myself
America
can finally come together when it
matters you know when the big things
matter
America comes together that progresses
and then I read an article that says
that uh the progressives uh didn't mean
it and uh representative uh jayapal she
withdrew that letter
that was the subject of all this and
says it was released by staff without
vetting
uh how do staff
how in the world would your staff
release a letter like that without
vetting
how in the world
all right you're an if you'd
waited two seconds you would hear me
saying I don't believe them instead of
saying Scott believe the squad he never
learns you use red bill now I guess he's
coming around how about waiting four
 seconds before you criticize the
messenger
goodbye
um
so let's talk about fetterman as we're
talking about Peak absurdity so he
started off his uh Thing by saying uh
good night to everyone so good night
everyone
when he began his uh debate now is that
a an example of someone whose brain is
not working
good night everyone
probably not
probably not suppose he had said good
evening everyone
good evening
what's the difference between good night
and good evening
it was night
he says good night everybody
does good night mean goodbye does it
mean hello
good evening usually means hello
good night usually means goodbye
but correct me if I'm wrong was he not
working off a teleprompter
what was not his first sentence on the
teleprompter
we don't know that do we because I've
got a feeling that the teleprompter said
that he probably just read it
now if all he did was confuse evening
with night
not the biggest problem in the world
so I don't know how to judge that one
but it happened uh however he did I
guess his team
accused the closed caption company of
being laggy and maybe inaccurate and so
it made him look bad because he was
reading things that didn't read right
and the company that made that system
and tested it with them and gave him
more opportunities to test it to make
sure it was just what he wanted says
um we gave you all the time you wanted
to test it you didn't do it and it's
exactly what you said was good and then
you said it wasn't good after we gave it
to you so I think I'm going to side with
the uh
probably with the company that produced
it because they did I do think they gave
them a chance to test it
um
John Cooper who's a Twitter user tweets
that every time Maga hears fetterman
stumble over a word tonight they mocked
him every time I heard him stumble I
felt inspired by his selflessness and
bravery
that's the difference between a liberal
and an scientist John Cooper
and I thought to myself
this this has stirred my competitive
juices
now I'm not proud of this
but I'm just sort of reflexively
competitive
like I can't turn it off it's just
always there
and when I see a competition like this
to be who could be the most uh peacock
like person in public and who can say
the thing that makes them look the best
while pretending they're talking about
an issue
so I thought I can top that
I can top that
all right so here's here's the bar he
set on John I'm going to try to exceed
this he says every time I heard him
stumble I felt inspired by his selfness
selflessness and bravery I'm thinking
okay that's good that's really good
I can beat that
and so what I tweeted was
um I'm too competitive to sit on all the
peacocking today so I would like to
submit my entry that proves my humanity
and awesomeness and this was my entry
John fetterman is so brave and selfless
that I have commissioned a statue of him
for my front yard
if all you did was vote for him
I win
I win
right
I think I win I mean I might be a little
biased in the scoring but I think I
think I win
statue beats tweet doesn't it statue
beats tweet every time
declaring victory
I saw this other uh two movies on one
screen tweet from
a Twitter user Point logic he's got his
Twitter handle is Socrates Big Bird
so this is somebody who likes logic and
Socrates and stuff and so this logical
person says according to the maggots
so I'm picking up some cues that it
might be a Democrat or a left-leaning
person because he's calling the bag of
people maggots according to the maggots
Fox News and a load of other Goons
hey I wonder if I'm one of those goons
but according to the maggots Fox News
and a load of other goons he says their
messages that vaccines kill you Pax
lovid kills you and REM does Veer kills
you but
these meds use for other things that are
proven ineffective for covet in all caps
are quote Miracles Ivermectin
hydroxychloroquine
and uh Point logic asks why is this
happening
why is it happening that we've divided
into two movies on one screen where one
says vaccines kill you Paxil if it kills
you rem deserveer kills you and the
other says Ivermectin
hydroxychloroquine work
what's your answer to how that happened
how did it happen
well I have a hypothesis
here's my hypothesis
the complete collapse of experts
once experts became no longer credible
and I think that that's a fair that's
that's a fair summary of the last few
years wouldn't you say would you all
agree with me that the experts took a
real hit in the last two years like
we've never seen before
has there ever been a time in human
history when the experts
did so poorly in any you know one or two
year period I mean it was sort of
unusually bad performance
uh you know maybe witch doctors or
something if you go back further
but
to my mind the complete collapse of
expert credibility left us all on our
own
and when you're on your own and the
experts can't help you or you don't
trust them to help you you just default
to your team
so what happened was the experts were
the only thing that kept us from being
complete
team players
like sometimes you'd say yeah like I'm a
Democrat but I also believe in science
and science says that nuclear power
plants are okay so even though that's
the thing Republicans say you know the
science allows me to
to connect with them and that one thing
right
but now once the experts are completely
discredited which is unfortunately Where
We Are
then people just agree with their team
because it's all they have left
well might as well agree with my team
now nobody thinks it through that way
I'm not saying that's a conscious
decision but it's the default
if you can't if you can't trust the
experts
you trust your team that may be a
terrible idea but it's just what happens
um
I saw an expert on AI Ethan Malik did a
series of tweets which I retweeted and
it's definitely worth reading this is
one of those threads where if you read
this thread you will just see the future
and I promise you you will like you will
see the future more accurately than the
people who did not read the tweet and
basically the gist of it is that the
public doesn't have any idea how fast AI
is coming right now specifically for uh
he was talking about the creative jobs
such as writing
yeah and he used this analogy which I
approve of in this case he said that
people probably are imagining that the
pace of AI is similar to the pace of
microchips where it doubles every X
period right so microchips were used to
um we're sort of acclimated to a certain
level of improvement in technology that
crosses all technology am I right
everything that is from social media to
microchips to everything else every year
is better
it could be significantly better like 20
percent better
right but 20 is nothing like what you're
going to see what we're already seeing
in AI AI is going to hockey stick it's
already in a hockey stick
so AI is not waiting for the hockey
stick
it's in the hockey stick it's it's in
the total upswing
this is a short path to the singularity
like if you were wondering when the
singularity was going to happen the the
one thing you had to know is it was
going to be nothing happening nothing
happening nothing happening nothing
happening it seems like a little is
happening but barely nothing barely
nothing barely nothing barely nothing
whole world changes
all right if you don't know that's
coming
you better get ready for it and that's
what the that's what this will tell you
I I've said before that uh predicting
the future three years out is now
impossible
and that's never been true before even
even when you could be surprised by Wars
and shortages and stuff even with a war
it still looked like a continuation of
the world you knew there just happened
to be War right three years from now
nothing will be familiar
AI will change everything
and there's nothing that can stop it
and it might be in one ear I mean that
it's probably only the commercialization
of it that makes it three years
probably in one year it will already
write better than all humans
in one year
AI will write
everything we want written because it
will do it better and faster you will
still be able to write because you
learned how you just won't have a reason
for it
there will never be a reason to write
after about a year
now think about that
just just think about that one thing
writing
could be obsolete in a year
that's a real thing writing
could by humans could be Obsolete and
now it might turn into some version of
editing
so here's how I imagined I would write a
Dilbert comic in a year from now
so roughly one to two to three years
from now this is how I would write a
Dilbert comic I'd say all right
Dilbert's talking to his boss they're in
the office and show me a new angle that
we haven't seen before
the first panel uh Dilbert says blah
blah blah second panel the boss responds
blah blah blah and then the third panel
uh add something funny
put a punch line there
and then I'm going to walk away
and that's going to be my entire job
that day
yeah in the future the only asset I will
own for Dilbert is the rights to the IP
I will no longer be the only person who
can make it
basically you will be able to make your
own Dilbert comics at home just by
speaking to your AI hey make some
Dilbert comics for me
no no make some dealer comments on me
just on this topic
it'll be done
that's probably one year away
now if you didn't know that was one year
away you really don't know what's
happening
it's coming and it's not just art and
writing that will change
it's everything
it's everything
the entire economy Wars
I really
the three years
it will be exciting I hope it will be
good
[Applause]
um
here's some more absurdities
the hunter laptop Hunter's
activities when his father was vice
president and even when he was between
between jobs
still sort of amazingly being ignored by
one half of the media
uh
all right amazing
absurdity is everywhere
[Applause]
um
the whole fetterman versus Oz thing if
you're making fun of conservatives for
uh they're let's say their ableism is
that what it's called if you're if
you're mocking fetterman because you say
that is
maybe temporary disability is preventing
him from doing the job then you are
against disabled people
to which I say
there's still a Special Olympics right
has anybody pushed for these Special
Olympics people to just be thrown in
with the regular Olympics people is that
happening or do people understand that
your ability affects and I know I'm
going to go out and live here
this is not widely understood and I
realize it's provocative but it's
possible
that your ability
has a some kind of a correlation maybe a
causation to your ability
now I realize we haven't connected those
traditionally because a lot of times
people think your ability
has nothing to do with your ability
and with fetterman we've decided to
disconnect those
so his ability we can't talk about how
his ability is related to his ability to
do the job
now if his ability
was unrelated to his ability
to do the specific job then I would say
that would be unfair
similar the same with the Special
Olympics if these Special Olympics
participants
if their ability
was equal to the ability
of the you know regular Olympics I would
be in favor of them playing together
all right
and
to me it's just amazing that this is
even a conversation fetterman I guess
came out and saying he's fully supports
fracking and he loves fracking he's he's
fracking in love with fracking
did
um did fracking
didn't we always think he was against it
he's just lying right isn't there video
of him saying the opposite or am I
imagining that because I got fooled by
the media on one side
yeah so he's just lying right
and apparently that's that works how
many how many Democrats do you think
know he's lying about fracking
how many Democrats do you think know
he's lying
25 percent
yeah it works because they don't read
the other media
so a Democrat let me let me give you
this as a model a Democrat can make any
lie
and be comfortable that the their voters
won't see the truth would you say that's
true
because the left does not read
Fox News website at all but the right
tends to see both arguments because the
the mainstream argument is mainstream so
they're more likely to see it
yeah it's not really a fair fight
there's one side that knows both sides
we saw that uh clearly and we already
talked about this the MSNBC uh
interview I guess you call it with a
bunch of trump supporters and where you
saw that the ordinary Trump supporter
just the citizen knew more than the
professional political reporter and
demonstrated it by correcting their
twice on facts
and that that was the perfect example of
how the right sees both arguments and
the left only sees one side these are
not these are not similar things they're
not even a little bit similar
all right uh Biden said in public uh
quote almost everyone who will die from
covet this year will not be up to date
on their shots
uh put on your analytical caps
give me two possible reasons why this
could be a true statement give me two
one of them would be vaccinations
protect you right but what's the other
possible explanation for why this might
actually be true that almost everyone
who dies from covid will not be up to
date on their shots
could it be because most people will not
be up to date
so most people in the world will not be
up to date
therefore doesn't it kind of make sense
that most people who are also
coincidentally dying
would be dying for unreal reasons
unrelated to covet
unrelated to covid but
I don't know uh
it's amazing that Biden can say that
kind of stuff out loud
but
at the same time
do you want to get into real
cancellation territory here
who's with me
let's fly close to the Sun
ready
son
Scott
let's do it
there's a Twitter user I've mentioned
before called ethical skeptic how many
of you are familiar with the Twitter
account of ethical skeptic
many of you on Twitter is very well uh
exposed
and this is what the ethical uh ethical
skeptic says this is not what I say all
right so I'm reporting what somebody
said I am not endorsing it and therefore
I cannot be canceled
do we all agree on that I think we do
so ethical Skeptics says the same thing
which I do not endorse nor do I rebuke
so you will see no opinion for me yet
he says the latest variant to come on
the Block what they are calling BQ is
seeking out vaccinated individuals three
to one over unvaccinated and has a
particular taste for those who were
recently vaccinated as well
so he's famous
this user Twitter user for being an
expert on data and for using public data
sources and putting them together in
ways that show different possible
conclusions than the mainstream ones
I don't know if anything he does is real
let me say it as quick as clearly as I
can
I cannot judge whether the ethical
skeptic is a genius
who's doing a service for the country
because many people are looking at it
that way and it might be it could be
or if it's somebody who doesn't know
what they're talking about but I can't
tell the difference
I have no idea
I have no opinion on whether this is
valid or invalid smart or not smart
true or not true I have no idea I really
don't I'm not kidding
I'm not joking I really can't tell and
it's one of my you know Mysteries I'm
trying to solve but
is there any other reason
first of all do you think it's true
as a fact you fact Jack this do you
think it's true that the vaccine the
recently vaccinated are more likely to
get covered
because remember the the vaccinated the
vaccinations don't prevent you from
getting it
but what what would the recently
vaccinated have in common
what would the recently vaccinated have
in common
wouldn't they well Democrats yes but
wouldn't they also believe that they
needed the booster
wouldn't it be people who's
self-assessed and probably their doctor
as well said oh you're you're in a
situation where you're either going to
be around a lot of people
you're either around a lot of people
or you might be extra weak
so
um it may be true that the vaccinated
are more likely to get infected
but there's nothing about the vaccinated
that is common to the public
or let me say that clear the people who
are recently boosted are a special group
of people and they're special in a
variety of ways so it doesn't tell you
anything about the public at Large
right so
is ethical skeptical showing us
something that is of the greatest
National importance and we're all
missing it
or is it as simple as the population of
people who got boosted is not like the
rest of us
I don't know
I know and and I would guess
that if ethical skeptic were here he
would say Scott Scott here's why what
you're saying is wrong and it would
probably make sense like I'm not selling
what my opinion has right
it's just a mystery to me I don't I
don't know
anyway keep an eye on that
um I Heard a theory about China
two theories about China that spell it's
doom and maybe the United States doomed
too but let's talk about China
uh one of them is that they're already
lying massively about their population
decrease and that Chinese populations is
substantially smaller than what you
thought it was because they've already
constrained their population and that
when you do that you end up with way too
many uh retired people compared to
workers and it's just basically a time
bomb and there's nothing they can do
about it
so basically they would be doomed by
demographics that's one theory of why
China is doomed number two
um
there's a theory that the the main thing
that makes any country look successful
is that they're overspending on
infrastructure because they need it
and that when Japan overspent on
infrastructure it looked like they were
booming and they were going to eat our
lunch
but when they stopped spending on
infrastructure and you know got down to
a normal level
they had no GDP growth for years and
years and years
and that the United States might you
know suffer a similar thing where if if
Government stops spending massively as
it has been recently then maybe we don't
have any real growth like it's all been
government
so by that argument uh when China
reaches its limit of uh not a limit but
when it does most of its infrastructure
projects and then it slows down because
it's done most of what it needs to do
it's just in a new stuff mode that there
won't be enough government spending in
China to keep the GDP having
and then it all falls apart
what do you think well in economics
there's one rule that I like to stick
with which is people are terrible at
predicting any of this stuff and the
Adam's law of slow-moving disasters
suggests that people will make whatever
adjustments they can
so these are gigantic threats to China
but I wouldn't say necessarily that that
means they're doomed but then they have
this third thing going on
which is they're no longer trustworthy
and being not trustworthy means that
people don't do want to do business with
you and I think that's going to hurt
more than it's hurting now
you know that trick where we said
Hillary Clinton was warning that the
Democrats would try to steal the
election which is a signal that I'm
sorry the Hillary warned that the
Republicans would try to steal the next
election which is really
priming the environment for the
Democrats to steal the election because
you won't see it coming
if they've made you think Republicans
are going to do it it's just a good way
to cover your evil
and now NATO is blaming Russia of using
the same trick
Russia is saying that Ukraine is
planning to use a dirty bomb you know a
nuclear dirty bomb
uh
whereas NATO says no no no
that's what Russia accuses the other
side of before they do the thing so
apparently that's a known strategy
that Russia accuses you of what they're
planning to do so if Russia accuses you
of a chemical uh a chemical weapons
attack
they are definitely going to use a
chemical weapon if they accuse you of
using a dirty bomb or planning it
they're definitely planning to use a
dirty bomb
now maybe to blame the other side maybe
just because they want to use it but I'd
worry about this
it looks like an understood problem
and NATO is all over it
all right
so back to my theme
my theme is that we've reached Peak
absurdity
look at every story I talked about
there's a story that maybe Russia will
nuke itself
because Russia thinks Ukraine is part of
Russia
so we're literally acting serious about
the possibility that Russia will nuke
itself
personally I think that's absurd
I don't see any possibility of that now
I also thought that Russia wouldn't
wouldn't invade so you have to put my
opinion in context right uh so my
ability to predict what Putin will do is
now uh has been demonstrated as low
ability
so
um
by the way do you know what my my most
frequent criticism is I never admit when
I'm wrong
I will submit to you that no one has
admitted they're wrong more often or
reliably than I have of any public
figure
that's my claim that literally of all
public figures of all time nobody has
ever spent more time admitting they were
wrong in public than I have
well if you think that's false name the
other person I think that the number of
times I've admitted I'm wrong in public
would be maybe 20 times
those of you who have watched me since
the beginning put a number on it
if you can remember just roughly how
many times do you think I've admitted
I'm wrong in public 20 times
somebody said 100.
yeah but you wouldn't but you wouldn't
disagree you wouldn't disagree with my
estimate of 20 would you like that's not
crazy
somebody says 10 or so
between 20 and 100. all right so
whatever it is if you're on uh if you're
on YouTube you're not seeing the
comments the low the people on the
locals platform most of them have
followed me for the longest time and
they they're not arguing with my
estimate
they're they're just putting different
numbers on it but there's an arguing
with the main point that I've admitted
I'm wrong a whole bunch of times
a whole bunch of times
now if you say you're wrong more than
anybody in the world or at least you
know you're in the top one percent of
that
people will tell you you never admit
you're wrong
and it's the most frustrating thing
it's the most frustrating thing because
I don't mind being accused of things
I've done I mean that doesn't feel good
but at least at least you feel you're in
a just world that makes sense well I did
make that mistake they are criticizing
me okay right so when people criticize
me for being wrong about
Russia invading
I don't I don't insult you right I just
say well yep you got me on that one
it's hard because you're a comedian in
your audience has lots of hecklers
maybe I'm not sure if people even see me
as a comedian when I'm doing this stuff
uh
okay Gino says you've you've recommended
me to others
because I've admitted when I'm wrong
the the thing about admitting money
wrong is that I don't think people
understand that it makes you stronger
if people understood that they would do
it
now obviously there's a right and a
wrong way to do it
but if you do it fully
and by the way is there anything more
surprising I like to use Mike cernovich
for all of my examples it's amazing how
many how many situations he fits into as
a as a teaching point
but so Mike's very much did the whole uh
you know the pizzagate situation
and then instead of like explaining it
away or you know making it look like it
the the real problem was his accuser he
just put it in his movie
so he made a movie and he just you know
he featured it
instead of explaining it apologizing for
it he just featured it
any any other questions
and I feel like that's what allowed his
um
his his Twitter traffic to grow Etc is
that people saw oh okay
you just you fully ex you just accepted
that and then he moved on
uh Mike made the movie A hoaxed
with an ed on the end hoaxed
which by the way I've recommended very
highly it's a tremendous movie and I
think I think we need hoax to too
because the number of hoaxes since that
movie
it's just begging for a hoax to two
which I hope he makes
all right
uh you know the hoax quiz
yeah similar to the superpower of saying
I don't know
you don't want to overdo that one but
there is power in admitting you don't
know something that's true
yeah
so now we have 16 hoaxes
and you know that's a abbreviated list
and even the people who know that 12 of
them are real hoaxes
foreign
that always amazes me
all right is there any story I missed
today
any any big thing happening I saw Mike
Pence uh
teasing that
yeah the Susan Sarah surrender tweet I'm
trying to remember I saw it but I can't
remember what that was
all right
where can the hoax list to be found
um
good question I think if you went to
Twitter and just searched for it
is also on locals I published it a few
times at locals
it's not a pin tweet anymore I changed
my pin tweet
uh there's a book about race hoaxes yeah
but I think the race Oaks is that's too
narrow
yeah there's a earthquake I guess this
morning
I did not feel it
or yesterday or yesterday
it's a 5.1
uh I mean what jobs would advise a
teenager that's tough you know I used to
advise teenagers to go into uh the Arts
because that would be the the last thing
that AI would get to
but
that's all wrong so now ai does better
graphic art and it does better writing
already it won't be long before it does
humor better
uh
the expensive toilet in San Francisco
yeah that's
the
so the stories I typically stay away
from are the air force uh was charged
two million dollars for a screw
right I'm talking about a physical screw
uh not prostitution
and
they the media gets that story wrong
every time
every time the reason that the the one
little part cost a million dollars is
that nobody made that part they had to
like build an assembly line just to make
the part and so they charge you what it
cost right it's a retooling cost and
when the media reports that they report
it like it's a market price and they
just gouged
is never that not once not once has that
story been true
every time you saw that story and how
many of those have you seen everyone was
fake
they were all fake and everybody who had
an economics degree knew it you know we
everybody watched it was like
no there's a reason it's a million
dollars now they may they may have
patted the million dollars which is you
know or related but a separate point but
the reason it's so expensive is because
they had to retool they may have also
you know padded padded the retooling
price I wouldn't be surprised
but the big the big answer is that they
had to retool
um
explain the two thousand dollar Air
Force heated mugs easily there were
there was a special requirement if you
look at their two thousand dollar heated
mugs I think you would find that they
either had to you know work if your
airplane is flying upside down or
something
there's probably some weird requirement
that required them to retool something
to make them something like that
or maybe the the demand was low so the
only way to make them is on
ineconomically
but if you looked into it you'd find
there was always a reason
here's what you wouldn't find
well honestly
it did only cost us ten dollars to make
these mugs honestly but we thought we
could get away with charging two
thousand dollars
I don't believe that's ever happened
and if it has somebody probably got
caught and got fired right
now the hospital bills are different
all right I'm talking about the military
Contracting
the hospitals charge whatever they just
whatever they want they just make up
numbers whatever they can get away with
Hospital prices is just based on what
you can get away with
wouldn't you say
am I right I mean it's always priced if
they can price it over cost of course so
that's the minimum but hospitals only
look at what they can get away with is
purely a
uh I mean it's closer to a scam than it
is an actual business model
uh Trump's testimony to be on tape today
that's going to be interesting
so
how surprised are you
that the January 6th thing uh followed
the following Arc
it was the primary thing that the
Democrats thought they could use against
the Republicans
and as of this week
Trump is still telling uh do a fact
check on this but I think Trump told Oz
that he needs to talk more about the
election
uh the election being rigged to win his
elections
do you believe that
we we went all the way from it's the
biggest problem that Trump has ever been
in
two if you don't accept it his view on
it you can't even get elected
that might be the biggest switch
in per maybe in the biggest persuasion
movement we've ever seen
oh I was bastards right I'm sorry
it was Blake Masters who was uh
receiving a phone call from Trump so it
was not
um yeah it was not Oz
but at the same point it doesn't matter
who it was the same point is that
that Trump can say out loud
you'd better talk about election
Integrity if you want to win
and I don't think he's wrong I think
he's actually right I mean even the
Democrats are talking Non-Stop about the
elections being riggable
Hillary Clinton is agreeing with Trump
that the elections are now secure
and and Trump did that
correct me if I'm wrong but he went all
the way from our elections are perfect
to not a single person in the country
trust the elections
I believe he did that all himself
right
there's there's no Democrat and no
Republican who fully trusts the system
now you if you do a poll you're going to
get 25 saying everything's fine but that
25 is brain dead on every question I
mean all the thinking people are worried
about election integrity and should be
right which doesn't mean there's a
problem
but you should be worried about it
yeah the Dems have been complaining for
years true
um once again Trump has shattered
reality
true story
now I'm going to throw in a
two unlikely predictions are you ready
number one most of the smart people say
we're headed for a recession in 2023.
I'm going to say that 2023 will be
better than we expected economically
I don't know what that means but I'm
going to say that the the consensus of
experts will be way worse than the
economy
and I'm going to base it on some sort of
a you know rule of thumb type stuff
without a lot of analysis
number one
employment stays High
number two we've had enough time to
adjust our uh
uh supply lines
you know maybe enough
next every other country will be doing
worse than us
which I I think there's an argument that
that helps you to be the best of the
worst
because that gives your currency strong
am I wrong about that
that as long as your currency is better
than all the other places that are worse
you're still okay it's just that if your
currency started looking bad compared to
others well then you're in trouble
so we don't have to be good we have to
be better than other places
right
so being better than other places is
easier than it's ever been
that's never been easier
and I think the United States has more
the United States is willing to shoot
itself
to rebuild faster than any other country
I don't know that that's true by the way
and that could be pure bigotry on my
part but it feels like the U.S is more
able to bury its uh bury his own
mistakes and just say all right
everything we're doing up to this point
was wrong let's do it all different rip
it out rip it out by the roots I think
we do that faster and better than
anybody
so I'm going to predict that our economy
except for inflation
I'm going to allow that inflation will
stay high for a while because it has to
and I'm going to give you
a counter-intuitive
when I say inflation stays High because
it has to it has to for good and for bad
like we had to drain we have to drain
some cash out of the system it's the
only way to do it
as far as I know and
but but as long as everything else keeps
humming along as long as America is less
bad than all the Alternatives I feel
like I feel like we're going to have a
good year next year
which will be a problem
for the 2024 election
because Trump or whoever is running
it might run into a strong economy a
weirdly strong economy and you might be
used to inflation by then
yeah inflation will not be good next
year so let me be clear inflation will
not be solved next year that will be the
problem that stays with us but if
everything else works
it's going to be
absorbable in the long run
all right
so I'm going to make that prediction
that the economy will be better than the
consensus of experts I don't know how
much better
here's my second one
Trump has an opportunity
that only one person has ever had before
only one person in the history of the
whole world
has been in a position that Trump is
likely to be in
and it goes like this
George Washington walked away from Power
when he didn't need to
for the good of the country he said
although you know I think that's the
historical interpretation I suspect it
was a little bit good for him as well
but it got interpreted as you know the
the greatest move
that really defined the whole country
didn't it
pretty much the most
fundamental part of our you know
National DNA
is that George Washington walked away
from Power
I would argue that nothing is more
essential
to the United States success
than George Washington walked away from
power and everybody learned it
you learned that when you were whatever
great right
Trump will be projected to you know
sweep the field everybody thinks he
could get the nomination and I think any
Republican can win now
so if Trump decided not to run
he would be the first president ever
who could do a legitimate George
Washington
and if the reason he gave was that he
was too controversial and there are
other other Republicans let's say who
have similar policies but less
controversy
he would not only redeem himself for
losing the first election
but he would pass him to Legend
territory
it would be Legend
If he if he does a second term
half of the country will think it was
the end of the world and will always
imagine it that way and half will think
you did a good job probably
if he walks away when he's guaranteed to
win and allows a republican let's say to
get in there and just do a good job
could be DeSantis somebody else
he would be Legend
you would be Legend and you could never
take that away from him
even the Democrats would say oh
the only problem we had with him was he
was he was too provocative
and he and he didn't want the country to
go through that again
think about it
now I don't think he's going to do it so
this is not not a prediction it would
seem counter to everything everything
he's done it would also be a big risk
because it would take him out of the
game
like too early because he's not done
like he's got more to do clearly so
unless he had more to do
let's say we're working on Truth social
or we're working on fixing the the media
if Trump left and said I'm going to work
on fixing
the debate
so I'll host a debate show so you can
see see which side works if Trump hosted
a legitimate debate show
he would run the country without being
president
doubt me go ahead
tell me I'm wrong about that you can't
if Trump said I'm not going to run
because I don't think people this age
should be president
uh foreign
but if Trump said I've aged to enter the
job and I'm a little too provocative
he would be Legend
he would he would Ascend basically you
would Ascend to just god-like territory
and the the anals of presidents in my
opinion that would be my opinion that
nothing could be a higher accomplishment
than that
and I'm right that I'm wrong yeah he's
not going to do it so the trouble with
my
um prognostic
prognostication here is that everything
you like about Trump tells you he won't
do that
am I right everything you like about him
is he doesn't give up
doesn't apologize doesn't quit like
those are all the things you liked so if
he apologized and quit I guess it
wouldn't be an apology but it would be
accepting his own limitations I guess
if he did that
that would be so out of Personality that
you you can't even imagine it really
I think he needs to win
now imagine he won with a strong vice
president
imagine he wins with a real strong vice
president
and then he steps down in two years
because he's not feeling well
that
he still keeps the option
but that would not feel as selfless
because it would be stepping down and
putting your own chosen vice president
in charge so that's not exactly George
Washington material
yeah and I don't see any I don't see him
stepping down
under any condition
I don't think that Trump would pick
Kerry Lake tell me why
go tell me why Trump will not pick
Carrie Lake as a VP well too soon that
that's probably all the reason you need
too strong yeah too strong
you don't want to pick somebody that
people will continually say you know
you know
maybe you should
make her present you don't want that
conversation to happen all and that
didn't happen with Pence did it was
there a lot of conversation about how
pens should have been the top of the
ticket
I don't remember hearing that even once
yeah Pence was perfect
uh that was just
I I can't say enough good things about
Mike Pence I don't want him to be
president but my god do I respect that
man
for for the service he did to the
country
all right
um
I think we've done everything we need to
do today let's go do some other things
am I right that this was the most
amazing live stream you've ever seen
did I pull my theme together
Peak absurdity
anybody
did I make my case I think I did I think
I did all right well then in that case
we've done what we need to do today and
I'll see you tomorrow
