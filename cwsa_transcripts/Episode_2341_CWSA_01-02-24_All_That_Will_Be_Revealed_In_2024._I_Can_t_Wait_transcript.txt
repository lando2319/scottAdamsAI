[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization and I'm talking about after
the Ice Age anything before the Ice Age
we don't know about we're just guessing
but since then this has been the
highlight and if you'd like to take this
up to a level that even Atlantis can't
understand all you need is a cuper muger
a glass a tanker chaline a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dop of me of
the day thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous SI and
abis
nowo
delightful invigorating
refreshing well let's talk about all the
news apparently George Soros his house
in Southampton got
swatted so the SWAT was called a fake
911 thing and uh I have a few feelings
about this number
one I do not like this swatting business
whatsoever it needs to stop my second
feeling is what the hell is wrong with
me seriously I'm not important enough to
get swatted oh oh Tim pool can get
swatted margerie Taylor green fine fine
but do I get squatted no I have to sit
here like an idiot and just say other
people got squatted other people and
nothing for me nothing for
me do you people not know how much of a
 I am for
attention people are getting attention
all over the place I'm getting none can
we please turn some of this toward
me that's what bothers me about this
whole swatting
stuff well if you're here's Sam Harris
you might not enjoy seeing that you're
trending on the xplatform which he no
longer is a part of but why is Sam
Harris
trending apparently the entire internet
or at least the xplatform has decided
that he looks like he's mentally insane
and that that explains his Trump
opinions I can't tell you how many
people have sent me the still photo of
Jordan Peterson in a split shot with Sam
Harris and Sam Harris is you know
looking deranged I'm not saying he is
I'm just saying that the photograph
makes him look deranged and uh and
Jordan Peterson is sort of sitting back
thinking well we don't know what he's
thinking but that's what people ask me
they said what do you think Jordan
Peterson's thinking to which I say if I
were as smart as Jordan Peterson I might
know what he was
thinking but if there's one thing I can
warn you
about don't try to guess what people are
thinking if those people are smarter
than you so I'm not going to try to I'm
not going to try to guess what you know
Einstein's thinking or Jordan Peterson
you know well whatever they're thinking
is probably better than whatever I'm
thinking but uh yes if you're trending
because the internet thinks you look
like you are mentally uh compromised
that's not a good week for you and I
would do what he did uh and your
subscription to the platform that thinks
you're mentally ill now in my opinion
there's nothing wrong with Sam Harris
except that the Trump derangement
syndrome does apparently it looks like
it broke him like not joking
aside if I may joking aside you know
we're not any experts on Mental Health
most of us some of you might be
but in all honesty
completely legitimately it looks like
there's a problem like actually not just
funny political thing to say not just
you know making some content for the
show it legitimately looks like he could
use a little help I mean it does look
like a cry for help and uh I'm actually
a little concerned for
him literally you know not not a joke
I'm a little bit concerned it it kind of
is starting to look like a Cry for Help
um so I I hope that goes well anyway how
many of you saw Green Day performing on
New Year's Eve did anybody catch Green
Day I I'll tell you what my first
impression was what I saw
it yeah I haven't seen them in a while I
haven't seen them played live in a long
time but when they when they came on
stage when I first saw them it it looked
like a bunch of middle-aged dads who
just left the
barbecue and I was watching uh who's the
front person Billy
Joel Billy Joe something I was watching
him you know bound onto the stage at the
beginning of the show and his bounding
on stage looked look sort of like he had
arthritis or
something Billy Joe
Armstrong yeah it was uh it it looked
like a bunch of dads doing a ever banned
it was pretty
embarrassing so anyway it was funny to
watch uh apparently uh the
X platform will have um uh Bank payments
well not Bank payments but Financial
payments you'll be able to do on X
sometime in the middle of 2024 we expect
here's what I'm wondering
about is Elon Musk simply going to
compete against other payment systems
like Google pay in venmo
or is he going to try to recreate a
bank which would be really interesting
in other words could you do all of your
banking on X if you were let's say you
didn't have complicated needs you know
basic basic banking is all you needed I
wonder do you think that uh there's
going to be a
micro uh lending
platform and I wonder why we don't
already have one probably because Banks
or something for example why can't you
and I um give a loan to somebody on X
and I'll say you know what I don't
really trust this thing but I'll give a
dollar I'll give a micro payment and
then if somebody gets like you know a
th000 views and bunch of payments they
just launch their business and I'm out a
dollar you don't think I would put
$1 on somebody who had a pretty good
idea but I don't know if it's going to
work I mean I'll put a dollar into it
you know if a million people put a
dollar into it a lot of people are going
to try some new stuff so I don't know
what kind of things you know Elon Musk
has in mind but I'd be a little
disappointed if it's only
payments I feel like there's a whole
other level that you could take it
to we'll
see you should replace Banks Banks are
ridiculous do you ever think about the
fact that banks have a checking account
a savings account a CD a credit card a
loan of credit and a mortgage for your
house how does that make any
sense do you know what it should
be uh you put your money in a
bank and if you've if you've given the
bank more
money uh you know if you put money in
they pay you
interest and if you take from the bank
more money than than you
have then you pay them
interest shouldn't it be simple
shouldn't be if you have my money you
give me interest if I have your money I
give you interest it shouldn't be that
there should be one account what why do
you have more than one
account why why do you have a checking
account and then some kind of line of
credit thing shouldn't your checking
account just turn into a a line of
credit if you spend more than you can
and shouldn't it warn you hey you're
spending more than you have now but
that's okay because you have credit okay
you're getting close to your credit
limit now you better slow
down do you know the reason that all
those different products
exist let's just see how much you know
about banking what is the reason so many
different products
exist uh well you're saying fees and
that's pretty good
but is that right because couldn't you
just adjust you know if you had a
simpler model couldn't you just adjust
your fees so you make the same amount of
money it's a simpler
model confuse op is the correct answer
it's a confusopoly
right so as long as everybody's in the
business of confusing their customers
you really don't know where to take your
money so you end up going whatever is
easy or close or what your family uses
or what your spouse uses is that's been
it yeah if if you were to invent banking
from scratch how much would it look like
current
banking nothing nothing there would be
almost nothing except you know verifying
your identity basically and you know
keeping track of your money but
basically almost all of banking is
unnecessary unproductive and stupid but
because Bankers have good
lobbyists uh they they make the the rule
R such that it's hard to get in the
business so they don't have to compete
with you as long as they can confuse you
it's called a confusopoly how many of
you have heard the term confusopoly
it's in
Wikipedia you haven't really a lot of
you have not heard of the
term so I'm looking at your comments a
lot of you have not heard the term
confuse op so that's what a phone
company is if you want to buy cell phone
service are you really smart enough to
know which service is going to give you
a better price for the service not
really because they don't price the same
one will be minutes with some carryover
some will be a family plan one would be
a year one will be two
years why do they do that they do that
so you can't tell which one's the good
one now do they have meetings where they
collude and say okay let be confusing
probably not but they all know that if
they stay confusing you can't compare
them to the other people the moment you
could compare a bank to its competitor
or a phone company to its competitor or
an insurance company to its competitor
they would all go on a
business because it it would drive the
competition to to lower their prices to
compete because you could see exactly
who had the the better price for the
service and then the price will just
keep going down until everybody goes out
of business and except one and you don't
want that
either so yeah it's a confuse op and if
you didn't know that's the term i i
invented uh it's actually in the
economic um vocabulary now if you search
for confusopoly you will find it's on
Wikipedia and it's a fairly well
understood concept from me
did I get my Nobel prize in economics
for inventing the confused op concept
which explains all modern
pricing no overlooked again overlooked
again I'll keep
trying well we have a new study that
says uh exercise makes you smarter I
think we knew that but every time
there's a new study that proves it then
it makes me feel smarter because I
exercise
um let me ask you this have you noticed
that there's a gigantic difference
between people who get to roughly my age
you know late
60s and you know their mental decline
you notice it right it's not my
imagination that you notice it you
notice it now there are some people who
do much better than
others um take uh Ellen dtz he's in his
80s
and if you heard him talk let's say
behind a a curtain you would have no
idea his age you there's no tell in the
way that man talks he's like how old is
he he like 83 or something how how old
is
dtz 80 81 something like
that yeah but imagine being
81 and if somebody heard you talk behind
a curtain they could not tell your age
that's really impressive really
impressive now I don't know this but
give me a fact check if anybody knows
this is dtz a lifelong
exerciser because he doesn't look like
he has any body fat on him can does
anybody know that I I'll bet you uh let
me place a bet I'll bet you dtz is a
lifelong moderate
exerciser I want to I want to see if
somebody can confirm that CU I don't
think there's any way
your brain works that well at that age
unless you've been a lifelong exerciser
so I'm just going to put that out there
somebody says he runs probably not still
but
yeah
so um I am a lifelong exerciser and I
believe that my brain works relatively
well for my age but that's my self
assessment so I'm going to keep
exercising all right um
I don't know if how many of you know
this but although I've been in favor of
building the wall and having tight
border security since since the
beginning I've always been in favor of
having complete control on the border
but different from many of you I had not
been in favor of mass
deportation so during Trump's first run
I said to you don't worry about Mass
deportation it's not going to happen and
it didn't happen
so I didn't really get into the
conversation about Mass deportation
because it seemed like a campaign thing
not really a reality thing there were
just too many of them you know you're
not going to send back 25 million people
whove been productive American likee
citizens for you know dozens of years
and stuff didn't seem practical now I
understand the concept break the law
there has to be consequence I get it I
get it but if you weigh it against you
know the the human part and whe we can
survive if they stay which we can they
they add more than they subtract in my
opinion over time not not right away but
uh as of today I'd like to go on record
and saying I am in favor of mass
deportation so I want you hear that as
clearly as possible so I'm reversing my
reversing my long-held
opinion that we don't need to send
people back because we don't have too
many that's what I used to think we
don't have too many and also I'm going
to remind you again the reasoning for
that when when America takes on people
from uh Mexico and Central
America we more often than not you know
there's always going to be a criminal
element that's in any population but
more often than not we're getting people
who are more American than Americans
yeah I said it I'm going to say it again
we're getting people who are more
American than
Americans if you look at what makes an
American
American right you you know if if you
look at the Traditional Values right you
know I'm not saying they're good or bad
but if you look at Traditional Values
good or bad they tend to be religious
hardworking family
oriented and they tend to be really good
citizens pretty quickly they tend to
integrate they learn the language their
second generation are awesome they're
hard workers they've taken a risk to get
here they really wanted to be here I
mean they really put in some effort to
be here
now like every conversation in the world
am I referring to every single person in
the Immigrant community no no do I think
that if you could snap your fingers and
send people back would I be in favor of
it I don't know maybe maybe that would
be a different conversation if it were
practical but if it's not
practical and they're good Americans and
they have a good history of you know
assimilation well it's not the biggest
problem in my list of
problems however we now have a
completely different situation we now
have a situation where there's some kind
of organized well-funded
destroy America system in place in which
the immigrants are coming from all over
the world and they're not coming from
Central Central America and from Mexico
primarily they're coming from from uh
Middle East China uh
Africa everywhere else now that system
will destroy America if it's allowed to
persist apparently we don't have any
legal recourse for stopping this process
because it's all legal nobody's doing
anything illegal they're just making it
real easy for the immigrants to come
here the only way to break that system
short of assassinating the people
involved which would be illegal
would be to make sure it doesn't
pay so you'd have to start shipping back
everybody who came from outside the
hemisphere so when I say I'm in favor of
mass um uh
deportation I means starting with people
who didn't walk here right if you had to
get on a boat or a plane to get in our
country you're going
home if you walked and all I'll include
you know the train and Mexico and stuff
if you walked maybe you need to go home
too but
last last right I I I would take care of
everybody who came over the water or in
a plane you know if they came from
somewhere outside the
Americas every one of them send back
every one of them 100% I don't care what
it costs at any expense and any
inconvenience and any any price yeah
they all have to go
back now the reason I'm not making such
a big deal about Mexican immigration is
apparently it's not that high it's not
that high the the the Mexican
immigration is not the biggest problem
in the world and I don't know if you've
paid attention but there are a whole
bunch of things happening in Mexico
right now that would suggest their
economy is getting ready to Surge the
Mexican economy has a bunch of good
stuff happening they got they got this
big train thing that's going to be good
for um everything we got stuff moving
you know manufacturing is moving
in it's kind of a positive economic
situation in Mexico more so than ever
before Oh I have confirmation that dtz
is a workout guy I'll tell you if you
see that people smoke cigarettes all
their life and get cancer lung cancer
it's probably good science
if you see the science that people who
exercise have fitter brains and then
every time you see a DT You can predict
whether they exercise I mean just think
about that I had no idea if dersu was
exercises but just based on his brain
and his age I presumed he was a regular
exerciser and sure enough it's confirmed
yeah that's not an
accident all right uh so Mass
deportation I'm all for it and I I think
it's funny because the Atlantic is
trying to scare the public that Trump is
in favor of mass
deportation in the first election that
was actually a pretty good attack
because even you know I was Pro Trump in
the first you know 2016 I was Pro Trump
and I didn't want I didn't want to see
Mass deportation seemed too hard but now
it just makes sense now it makes
complete sense in fact it's a no-brainer
now I don't know how many people you
could actually Mass Deport but you
should try really hard we should try
really hard to deport every single
person who flew or took a boat and we
should shut that down right away make it
make it not
pay all right so uh there's a
uh uh influential American psychologist
he's called Martin
Seligman he's uh in his 80s and he found
out recently that his uh people who know
him and have worked with him had created
a bot an AI uh entity based on all of
his writings so they apparently
recreated they recreated him and when he
tested it out he actually thought you
actually it gives pretty good advice so
they've actually created a advice giving
entity that's based on a real person's
writing and of course now they can make
it photo realistic and they can match
the
voice so I asked the following
question can a scottbot be far
behind now unlike most of you I have a
huge body of public work so if you're an
author or if you're an American
psychologist who wrote a lot um it
should not be hard for a scottbot to
completely absorb my personality cuz if
you got how many hours of U live
streaming do I
do at least two hours a day so I'm up to
like you know 800 hours a year times
what five
years and that's just live stream then
you add all the interviews that are on
on the internet you add all of my books
all of my
cartoons the cartoons don't exactly talk
to my personality as much is my sense of
humor I
guess the only thing that the scottbot
could not do
is sense of humor so AI seems to be good
on look and sound and
grammar but it's not good on sense of
humor and it's not good on you know not
hallucinating
yet uh now Brian relli promises us that
uh sometime this year we'll have access
to something he's working on which would
be a personal AI so you'd have your own
AI agent now I'll tell you again that
here's how the world will go guarantee
it right this is the the safest
prediction you could ever
make it seems unlikely to me that each
person will have to go find their own AI
app every time they want to do something
we're going to have our own personal AI
that nobody can touch and that's the
only thing they should interact with the
other
AIS so you won't you won't interact
directly with some other AI app you'll
talk to your own and it will figure out
which app it needs to deal with to get
you what you need because it's going to
be too hard to keep track of all the
apps and what they can do and compare
them and it's going to be a confusopoly
oh here we go AI is already a
confusopoly
do you know why somebody would buy chat
GP subscription instead of let's say you
know
Bing because they don't know the
difference you you're going to have a
million apps that look like they're sort
of the same but they will price things
differently so you don't know which
one's the good one so you're probably
going to need your AI just to sort
through the AI confusopoly to figure out
which wants to use at the right price
yeah some will have term limits right
some will have usage limits some will
have too much
censorship so it will be impossible for
you to sort out which app to use and
that will be
intentional well you probably knew this
but uh the US military finished their
study of all the uh White supremacists
and extremists in the military and they
found
uh they found uh extremist in the
military the white supremacist uh they
found uh I didn't find any there weren't
any no it wasn't zero but it was
something that looked like the rest of
the public right so there were some
there were actually some acts of
extremism but they were somewhat trivial
in their
numbers
so why was the military even
looking do you think that the
generals believe there was a problem
or do you think it was always an
OP so that as long as they were looking
for the problem and said there was a
problem it would it would put a cloud
over Trump that was all just to put a
cloud over Maga and Trump right so that
was an OP wouldn't you
say was it ever do you think there was
ever any chance that was real and that
they just really they were worried and
they really need to find out probably
not it was probably exactly what it
looked like it was a political op that
as long as they were talking about it it
was good for their team so yes our
military is
political great great wouldn't it be
good if they were just trying to protect
us but no they mostly want to see uh uh
generals and
dresses they want to see most of our
leadership wearing dresses because you
know that scares China and
Russia look at our generals they look so
good in
dresses all
right and yes that's a sexist
statement but when you talk
oh let me explain this again in case
anybody's new to
me um I'm completely opposed to any form
of discrimination against individuals in
employment renting loans personal life
marriage anything anything individual
don't do any discriminating don't
discriminate on race or gender or you
know sex or
anything but there is an exception where
you can discriminate all you
want did you know
that yeah defense your personal defense
you can descriminate as much as you want
if somebody says why did you punch that
guy who was wearing a hat
and you say the last 10 people who wore
a hat uh mugged
me okay now is it up to me to tell you
that you acted incorrectly well maybe if
you violated the law the law has to get
involved but do I think that you made a
mistake by punching the 11th person who
wore a hat if the first 10 people with
Hats punched you I do not to me that
seems like a quite reasonable
self-defense stance and I would not
question it it might be illegal and the
law would have to deal with that but I'm
not going to question it logically
ethically or morally cuz nobody gets to
make the decision but you I don't get to
make your personal defense
decisions if somebody's an intruder in
your house are you going to call me and
say Scott there's an intruder in my
house should I shoot them it's not up to
me only you can make that decision and
you know what you can use anything you
want you can use anything you want you
could use your
biases absolutely yeah if if you're if
there's somebody in your house a home
Invader you can use any bias you
want any bias you want it's not illegal
it's not immoral and it's not unethical
because it's self-defense likewise
National Defense discriminates like
crazy right does anybody complain that
our Pilots uh um have to have good
eyesight does anybody complain that our
soldiers need to have legs that
work nobody complains because when it
comes to defense you don't around
you do what
works end of story end of story right so
yes you can discriminate all you want in
the
military um but maybe they should get
back to that instead of looking for bad
mag of people in the
ranks all right
uh
so according to a uh professor at
Georgetown University who used to be in
the CIA he was a CIA analyst Dr John
Gentry uh he says he believes that the
uh you know the Intel agencies are going
to try to interfere in the 2024 election
so he's an actual CIA guy who is
Credible enough to be a Georgetown
University professor and he he thinks
it's somewhat
obvious that they're going to interfere
with the election now of course he
points to the you know famous Hunter
laptop thing as an
example
um and he says that the Intel agencies
have been compromised by politics but
here's what he says is the
reason um he said the old standard of
not getting involved in in politics was
largely gone and he pointed to two main
reasons former CIA director John Brennan
and former Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper now is there
anybody who watches television or
follows the news who doesn't know that
those two
gentlemen have a lot of questions to
answer is any anybody didn't know that
there's something about those two
there's something about them that you
need to know I don't know what it is but
there's something about them you need to
know
um and he blames them for uh beinging
bringing in
Dei uh diversity Equity inclusion and
policy actions that basically made it
political so apparently if you hire
people for their Dei characteristics you
might get more people who are
political I don't know I don't know if
that's directly connected but that's is
seems to be what he's
suggesting um and he now thinks that
political activism is
common
so um we now have a number of people
saying that they think
the our own intelligence agencies will
assassinate Trump or attempt
to so the people saying that
directly or V ramaswami running for
president and tell telling you that one
of the candidates is likely to be
assassinated not just
maybe but
likely before it even happens now we're
also seeing Steve Bannon say it I think
Jack babic said it I think cernovich has
hinted at that as well uh I say it
directly as well um how many people
Tucker Tucker Carlson says it
directly uh RFK Jr I think he's saying
it directly is he
not now have we ever uh don Bonino
saying it directly Alex Jones is saying
it
directly I'm looking at some names going
by as you're suggesting them have you
ever seen a situation like this
before this is pretty unprecedented
isn't it do you know that the it's it's
possible that the only thing keeping
Trump alive is
US literally us and when I say us I mean
the people who are independent enough
that they can say out loud in public in
front of all of you it looks like
they're going to try to kill them
because they've created a situation
where they've talked themselves into him
being evil enough that that makes
sense yeah
so I feel like it's it's our Collective
understanding of this risk and our
willingness to say it out loud and look
crazy because it's not easy to say it
out loud you do look a little you know
like you're close to the edge there but
I don't think it looks crazy at all I
think that it looks
obvious I you know and uh Tucker does
the best job of explaining it you know
once they don't be you in the vote and
they don't be you in the impeachment and
they can't be you in putting you in jail
the r of
options what's left and I don't think
that we you know can say it's never
happened in American history because
there's a strong suggestion that JFK was
not what it looked like so honestly I
think we're keeping Trump
alive we being people who are willing to
say this out loud because if it
happens God forbid but if it
happens then nobody will be surprised at
the response
right I don't know what it would be but
whatever it is it's going to be big and
I'll tell you one
thing if Trump goes
down you're going to get something just
just as
aggressive right the the one thing that
the Republicans are doing well uh with
the exception of Nikki Haley is that
they're suggesting that there's
something behind Trump that could be as
interesting as Trump you know certainly
F all right
um in my opinion the biggest existential
risk to the United States is the
Dei now I'm not saying that with like a
clever political hyperbole I actually
think that's true like
literally
scientifically you know
objectively and somewh
obviously because Dei is the only thing
that can break
everything everything else that could go
wrong at least we have everything else
that's still working to fix it you know
what I mean like if we had a techn let's
take the year 2000
bug the year 2000 bug was something that
was broken you know we thought the
computers were going to stop working
because they couldn't handle the year
2000 but because our technology industry
was so robust and healthy it fix
right so there are things that we can do
wrong but because our military is good
we got away with it right so there's a
whole bunch of situations where you can
make you know have a big problem in some
part of your larger system but you can
fix it because the rest of the stuff's
still working so the rest of the stuff
figures out how to fix the stuff that's
broken but Dei is different Dei by its
nature guarantees that you're looking
for a small pool of candidates to add to
your diversity and simply because the
numbers are small you're going to end up
going further down in the quality list
in order to hit your number so
necessarily even if you assume that
every every person was equal quality in
the world you know every demographic
group if you even start with that
assumption it still destroys the world
this is an important point if if you
start with the assumption that all the
ethnicities and genders are equal
capability equal potential if you start
with that and you operate on that
assumption and try to get equal numbers
of them that will destroy the world it's
guaranteed if you were an engineer and
somebody said I'm going to design a
system and they take all the politics
out and they just described it like a
machine an engineer would say well
obviously that's not going to work
it's only because it's political that we
even think it makes any sense at all
right it doesn't make sense
logically engineering wise physics wise
doesn't make sense in terms
of
math there's literally no argument for
it except that it's how people feel and
what they want to feel so Dei can
destroy and is literally every part of
the country so you can see it's um the
the claim here is that Dei from this
professor um Professor
Gentry uh he would claim that Dei is
ruining the intelligence people we just
talked about the military wasting energy
looking for you know uh White
supremacists that they couldn't find why
does that happen Dei right it's all part
of the same philosophy well why is it
that the system is more divided racially
Dei why are our corporations no longer
as capable Dei why is it that every time
you go to get any simple thing done just
accomplish any simple thing that
involves another person helping you you
can't get it done there's like a massive
incompetence problem in the country
again not related to race or religion or
gender if if if that's what you're
hearing you're missing the whole
point th this would be a problem if
everybody had exactly same average
capability you you get the same problem
it's just you're trying too hard to
force a square peg into a round hole in
a short time frame and it can only go
one
way so until we can say that out loud
there's no hope of fixing it but I do
think that 2024 will be the
year it will be the year that we can say
that out loud and then there can be some
changes uh certainly Harvard has
destroyed its entire reputation with
Dei so the colleges are worthless the
military is degraded our intelligence is
bad intelligence departments and our
government of course is a bky case and
our our corporations are less
competitive and then throw on top of
that climate change and whatever
regulations that causes
yeah we're basically doing it to
ourselves it's uh
self-inflicted um here are some fun
things we could find out in
2024 uh there's some indication there
might be some Epstein flight logs
released that would be different than
the ones you've seen there are a bunch
of fake ones and old ones going around
ignore those I don't know what's real
yet but ignore the fake Epstein lists
don't believe anything you say about
fste list unless you're seeing it on the
major news if you see only on social
media
Umberto Eko and John chelini you s their
love I don't know what that
means anyway here are some things we
might find out we might find out more
about Epstein but I doubt it because
obviously that's been buried pretty
pretty hard um at this point here are
the things we can say about Epstein
there's no doubt whatsoever he was
murdered there's no doubt whatsoever our
government had some
involvement maybe other governments but
certainly ours and there's no doubt
whatsoever that it was to cover up for
the powerful people that were being
blackmailed there's no doubt at all does
anybody have any doubt about what
happened with the Epstein
situation we we're way past any
questions about that our
it's exactly what it looks
like it's exactly what it looks
like yeah and do you think Bill bar is
dirty because Bill bar was the one who
who uh essentially put the stamp of
approval on the suicide
narrative it looks like it yeah I mean
it would take some investigation to know
but on the surface it looks like he's
compromised or that you did it now let
me let me give you the the positive
version the positive version is that he
knew it would destroy the world if we
found
out so there there is a possibility that
he saving the world you know that right
it's not your choice it's not your first
choice because you'd rather know and
you'd rather let the cards fall where
they fall but if you're in his
position and you knew that releasing
this could
actually destroy the world order which
it might you know it could destroy let's
say uh
alliances it could destroy marriages it
could destroy the effectiveness of
leaders it could destroy a
lot do you think there's any chance that
banon I'm sorry that bar do you think
there's any chance that bar said you
know what I hate everything about this
Epstein thing he's guilty as hell there
was definitely a lot of blackmail but I
got to cover this up because the
world isn't ready for this what do you
think so I'm I'm going to say this is my
working assumption my working assumption
is a bar covered it up but I'm going to
be open-minded as to
why your your assumption is it's for a
bad reason it might be certainly that's
the first thing you think but put
yourself in this position would you
necessarily destroy the
country to to just know the truth I
don't know don't know so I'm going to
say that I I think bar is a more
interesting
character because he's not he's not
immune to
patriotism he is not immune to
patriotism I don't know what else he is
but I don't think he's immune to
patriotism so I'm going to give him at
least that
possibility here are some things we
might just think about the things we
might find out in
2024 now I'm not going to bet that any
of these will be will happen but we
might we might find out some surprises
about the 2020
election or at the very least we'll find
out there are no surprises because there
are some specific things that people are
tracking down that look look kind of
interesting I don't want to say Kraken
but they do look interesting um I think
we'll find out a lot more about the
trials against Trump and how fake they
are so we're talking about a month from
now we might get some kind of an answer
about whether Trump's businesses will be
taken from him for his alleged illegal
activities but just hold this in mind
the illegal activity in mind was that he
overvalued his properties when he dealt
with deuts bank
the deuts bank um leaders who who
testified said that they don't pay
attention to the client's estimates they
do their
own and that they liked doing business
with them and they would do business
with them again and they lost no
money now have you ever seen anybody go
to jail when the
victim the victim says under oath there
was no
crime they didn't say that they weren't
hurt they said there was no crime and
they're the
victim how in the
world does that trial
complete when the victim said the crime
didn't happen the victim under
oath under oath said the crime didn't
happen not only did they say the crime
didn't happen they explained compl
completely credibly same thing I told
you before they did that it is Bank
procedure to not pay attention to the
customers estimates because they can
never be trusted so it's not illegal to
have a high estimate and give it to a
bank because they don't even pay
attention to it they do their own and
that's what the bank said and I told you
the bank would say that you know months
before they
did now what is the country going to do
if if Trump is found guilty well
actually I think he's already found
guilty right didn't the judge already
rule that he he did in fact inflate his
asset yeah he's already guilty so the
only decision is what they're going to
do about it right what they're going to
do about it and one of the possibilities
they would take his businesses away from
his
control in
America in
America so he runs for public office
office and then he would lose his entire
his entire Empire or at least the
control of it you'd still have the
financial interest but he lose control
of
it for purely
politics th this would be such an
injustice I mean I think Jack Smith
would have to increase his security
quite a bit if if this happens because
there's nobody who's going to see this
as Act of Justice if he gets convicted
and well anybody who understands the
issue would would know it's not justice
so Powder Keg we'll see what happens how
about uh Ukraine money laundering I
think we'll find out more about that
maybe do you think we'll find out who is
bribing Congress on the Asylum question
or the Tik Tock
question wouldn't you like to have a
list of people who are not in favor of
changing the Asylum process
the Asylum process is why mayorca and
Biden can say they're doing a good job
because they're following the law as
long as people apply for Asylum we have
to process them as if they're legally in
the system well why don't we change the
Asylum process does anybody know the
answer to that I don't I have no idea
the only the only working assumption I
have is uh massive corruption the only
explanation is that Congress has bought
off can let let me ask you this do you
think if you did a poll of the public in
any state in any state you said Asylum
is the reason that you know we have this
massive immigration problem do you think
we should relook at the Asylum laws what
do you think an American citizen would
say to that
question oh yeah of course obviously
yeah obviously we should look at the
relook at the Asylum law because it's
called causing a problem why is that not
happening po say 40% it they don't say
40% if if anybody is if any if anybody
hears the situation
described as the entire source of all
the illegal immigration from you know
Africa and the Middle East and China
nobody's going to be in favor of that
nobody you probably couldn't even get
one
person yeah so if you describe it
properly it' be closer to 100% would be
in favor of relooking at it and changing
it and it doesn't
happen what what what could the possible
reason for that be well corruption
there's no other reason well here's what
I think I think we should have a
percentage that we use as a standard to
know when corruption is
happening for example let's say
70% if there's something that the public
understands they understand the question
it's not complicated and 70% of the
public wants it and Congress won't do
it I think we just assume it's
corruption if it's
5050 you can kind of understand why
things don't get
done right you can understand that but
if it's
7030 in the public and and let's say
there's a majority in both parties but
7030 overall but a majority in both
parties and it doesn't get done how can
that be explained any other way but
corruption even incompetence wouldn't
get you there because they do get stuff
done so it's not incompetence it's got
to be intentional why just
corruption I can't think of another
reason we may find out more about the
jary 6 hoax especially the fact that
they threw away all their records uh
maybe we'll find out if aliens are
visiting the Earth or they've always
been
here all right um remember I've told you
that when I took hypnosis classes I
learned that when people do these
so-called Freudian
slips that they do mean something
especially if there's more than one one
could be a mistake just a slip but if
somebody does the same type of slip over
and over again it's really telling you
something and I saw a kanakoa the great
in one of his posts he he showed a a
compilation video of Biden saying things
that probably meant exactly what they
said or exactly what he said here are
some of the things he has said in
public I don't need you to vote for
me as if the vote wasn't going to matter
like he was going to win and they talked
about he needs you to help him after he
gets elected he actually said I don't
need you to vote for
me now um he also said that we have the
most extensive and inclusive voter fraud
organization in American politics we
assume what he intended to mean is we
have an anti- frud
organization but what he said was we
have the biggest fraud
organization now if that were the only
thing he said again I'd say well like
he's old it's just a slip it's easy to
say you know to to forget the anti
that'd be an easy mistake but he has
also said the following thing a number
of
times it only matters who can counts the
votes a number of times in public Joe
Biden has said it only matters who
counts the votes Joe Biden said that a
number of times in public about the
United States that it only matters who
counts the votes out loud directly
multiple
times now of course he was doing that
when complaining about Republicans you
know maybe rigging something and maybe
they do I don't know but he says it
directly now do you
think that one person could say this
many things without it actually being
what he's actually thinking I don't need
you to vote for me most extensive voter
fraud organization and it only matters
who counts the
votes that would be a lot of Freudian
slips yeah that would be a
lot I'm going to say this is exactly
what it looks like to me this is Joe B
being completely aware that the election
is rigged and that it needs to be rigged
in his favor in order for him to win
that's what it looks like to me can't
read his mind but the signal is
unmistakable all
right
um I remind you that if you see anything
about the Epstein uh Client List uh or
the flight list it would be because Mike
cernovich um retained the lawyer and got
that cernovich who had nothing to do
with anything to do with Epstein he was
just a concerned citizen who decided we
didn't know enough and the only reason
we know anything is because somebody not
involved in the government spent his own
money to make it
happen that's the only reason we know
that because certainer did
it Ju Just Just hold that in your head
for a
moment that the only reason we know
anything is because a citizen did it
spent his own money wanted to know the
truth I me just think about that it's
incredible all right
um there's new Poll for Trump that shows
he's uh leading Biden with Hispanics and
young voters
do you believe
that do do you believe that Trump would
actually in a straight up election do
you think he would actually beat on
Hispanics and young voters wouldn't that
be the the biggest switch around we've
ever seen in
politics I'm not sure I believe it
yet here's the problem with it I think
there's still a lot of
undecideds and I feel like the
undecideds
probably would go where they've
historically gone so I know same in
2020 I don't know the the polling is
having some big problems in modern times
I don't know if this is I don't know if
I'm going to believe this
yet um but Biden also lost support among
black
voters uh way up
so what do you make of this
uh mainstream media has been calling
Trump a white supremacist and racist for
what 7 years straight just
non-stop and he's actually gaining in
the group that he's supposed to be the
white supremacist
against what's that what's that all
about it's got to be about
capability right it's got to be that
people are looking are seeing through
the propaganda at this point if if you
were Hispanic or
black don't you think you would have
noticed that every white person in
charge is called a white supremacist and
wouldn't you just start to be blind to
it because it's like it's just what we
call
everybody I I feel like being called a
racist doesn't mean anything in
2024 it it just doesn't have any it's
just it's empty there's nothing to it
anymore because it's so
ridiculous
most cases it's so ridiculous that you
don't even take it
seriously all right well we'll see if
that poll holds
up
um so uh Bannon also was um yeah Bannon
was also talking about how uh all the
Trump supporters are being taken out one
by
one and you see it right you see anybody
who is Pro Trump is being targeted by
hit pieces and you know lawsuits and all
kinds of stuff yeah
now now that you see the larger
context I'm too close to this to to be
uh objective but do you think that me
being cancelled globally was
political or was it really about what I
said how many of you think it was
political
you you may be influenced by me when you
say
that yeah I think we're all biased on
that
question here's what I
think I think that it's never one thing
you know most things are complicated so
most things have you know multiple
reasons and multiple variables so I
don't think it was necessarily
completely political but I don't think I
would have been cancelled world wide
unless uh I had been speaking
politically for a long time do you do
you think I would have been
cancelled uh had I not been a political
voice I don't think so because for one
thing you never even would have known
about
it right if I were not somebody who
talked about politics all the time
nobody would have even tweeted around
the video nobody would even know about
it yeah China got me maybe but I think
the fact that the Washington Post was
leading
it uh is not a coincidence now there's
also a business element to it because
I've been a Critic of the Washington
Post long before they canceled me so
they were paying me while I was
criticizing them that wasn't going to
last let let me tell you the the least
surprising thing was the Washington Post
cancelling me because I've been calling
them for you know years and they
are they're just complete garbage The
Washington Post so that's not a
surprise yeah so has a political
Dimension
um and uh just imagine somebody saying
this even a few years ago or here's v
ramaswami he's talking about claudian
gay the president of Harvard and you ask
yourself could any major candidate for
office have said this even a few years
ago to see how things have changed right
so this is V ramaswami claan gay raises
a problem for Harvard that kamla raises
for the
Democrats
uhoh uh
oh are you are you already a little bit
worried for him oh where's he going with
this yeah so uh Claud Gray gay raises
his problem for over the Comm raises for
the Democrats when someone got the job
based on RAC and gender it becomes
impossible to fire them the the Supreme
Court ended affirmative action in
college admissions now time to end it in
University
hiring
wow yeah he says it directly that kamla
and CLA and gay are diversity hires and
if you do diversity hire you can't fire
them and he says that's what what we're
seeing Oh my God now am I wrong you
couldn't really say that if you were a
major candidate you couldn't really say
that three years ago could you you you'd
be
cancelled will will he be cancelled
no so what what has
changed let me ask you what has
changed why can we say this out loud
now what
changed
well some of it is people like me who
are just unwilling to be censored at any
cost so there's some of that um so it's
some of it is
leadership accidental as well as
intentional in V's case it's intentional
he he's he's showing leadership as so it
makes it safer for you in other cases
people showed
leadership accidentally I I guess I
would would be the case for me I wasn't
trying to show you any
leadership it worked out that way all
right um but I think that people that
are fed up I think that the the
immigration um feels different when it's
no longer our
neighbors because the way I feel about
my
neighbors Mexico and Central America is
really really different than I feel
about somebody who flew from the other
side of the world
right I just have a better feeling about
my neighbors
period so some of it is immigration some
of it is leadership some of it is uh
vake some of it is people have just had
it some of it is just too
far yeah hashto far I think that's
really the thing that explains it
most well uh cutter mediators Qatar if
you prefer um they think they have have
some agreement in principle to have a uh
one month
ceasefire and get 40 hostages
back what do you think of
that do you do you think a one month
ceasefire to get 40 hostages back is a
good
deal you know I would have said
no in earlier in the war but at this
point Israel has such a control over the
area and they've destroyed so
much would would a month actually help
Hamas or would they just starve in a
month I here's the main
question I believe that in the beginning
time was on the side of Hamas because if
you gave them some extra time they could
prepare extra good but once they've been
degraded to a certain point and
presumably they'd be running out of you
know food and water and ammunition and
everything once they're running out of
stuff and there're there's not any easy
way to get new stuff in cuz I'm sure
it's
tight then can you afford to take a
month because what is some must going to
do in a
month they're not going to get any new
supplies they're not going to what are
they going they're going to be in their
tunnel for another month I mean at this
point you could just leave them in the
tunnel could
you you know and little by little you
find out where the tunnel entr are and
you know may
maybe let me propose this if you had a
ceasefire does that mean that the uh IDF
the Israeli forces would have easier
access to look for tunnel
openings and search around for their
targets if nobody's shooting at them as
they're walking down the
street now I don't imagine I can't even
imagine how you could have a ceasefire
does anybody think a ceasefire would
hold for a month
who who thinks the ceasefire would hold
for a
month I don't yeah I think it you know
two hour stops
but here's the question if if you're
tempted to say that Israel would be
giving away a military Advantage by
pausing I'm not so sure that was
definitely true in the beginning it
would have been a military advantage to
give away but
now um I don't think that watching from
the outside we have enough enough
information but I suspect the Israel
could maybe wait a month without losing
too much and if they got some hostages
back it's a win so I'm tentatively
mildly in favor of
this but I'm very skeptical that anybody
would agree to a one month ceasefire it
seems like fake
news doesn't it why do you need a
month and what's a month by you why
can't you do it in a
week I know speaking of Netanyahu his
popularity is down to
15% 15 in
Israel um that's how many want him to
keep his job after Gaza but weirdly his
Gaza policies are popular have you ever
seen that before have you ever seen a
country go to war and their their leader
became less popular
so Israel is
attacked and their leader who they say
is doing apparently a good job of the
response and he's less popular what is
going on here how does that make sense
how do you get less Popular by doing a
good job in a National
Emergency I feel like maybe the data is
wrong like maybe it's the way they ask
the question something like
that I don't know maybe a Tik Tok thing
speaking of Tik Tock so I as you know I
don't use Tik Tok for the obvious
reasons uh because it's a Chinese
propaganda machine but a lot of the Tik
Tok videos end up on other sites after
the fact um have you ever gone down the
rabbit hole of the anti-israel
argument
so I ended up I guess the algorithm
decided to feed me anti-israel stuff
yesterday so I saw more anti-israel
stuff yesterday than I've seen since the
beginning of the war every bit of it had
a Tik Tock label on
it let me say that again I've seen more
anti-israel propaganda in the last 48
hours I guess than all everything put
together before that all of it had a Tik
Tock label on it in other words it
started in Tik Tok and ended up where I
saw
it now there's one thing that both the
uh pro-israel and the anti-israel
propaganda have in common and it's
maddening it's maddening they both
ignore the other side of the argument
when they make their argument so I
actually listened to somebody you know
talking to a Palestinian
citizen who was complaining that her
house was bul bued and that 26 other
houses had been bulldozed around the
same
time isn't there like a followup
question to
that it was in a documentary I saw isn't
there a follow-up question like was
there any reason for
that they they don't bulldo they don't
bulldoze houses
randomly they bulldoze your house
because somebody in the house was a
terrorist according to Israel now that
doesn't mean they're going to be right
every time it doesn't mean that I
necessarily support what they're doing
I'm just saying that if you're
complaining about your house getting
bulldozed and you don't at least say a
few words about maybe why they did it
that's not a documentary that's
that's some right
there uh likewise when Israel says hey
you know we let the Palestinians you
know determine their own future and all
that and they leave out
what life is like for the average
Palestinian well that's just
propaganda
too so the argument that I was hearing
from the anti-israel ones is if if you
had lived the way the Palestinians
live could you imagine that you might
also become or it's easier to imagine
somebody would become a suicide bomber
because they have no hope now the
anti-israel propaganda
uh was trying to push the position that
if you made the Palestinians uh
prosperous and healthy they would have
no reason to attack Israel and then your
problem would be solved and therefore
logically uh all of Israel's problems
are caused by Israel say the
propagandist because Israel is doing the
thing that makes the Palestinians
miserable and it's the misery that
caused them to become terrorists
therefore it's really all Israel's fault
is there anything left out of that
story yes what is left out is if the
Palestinians were prosperous and healthy
they would still want to destroy
Israel it wouldn't be any
different it it is also true that their
lives are a struggle in many
ways but it's not true that if you fixed
it there's any evidence whatsoever any
evidence there's not even a hint that
would make any difference at all because
the children are being taught to kill
the Jews and the zionists are all bad
and you know if they start making more
money they're not going to stop thinking
they need to do that stuff now it might
be harder to
recruit a suicide bomber it might be
harder but didn't those uh correct me if
I'm wrong but weren't the 911 uh suicide
hijackers weren't they Saudi some of
them or all of them how many of them
were Saudi
residents yeah they they didn't even
come from a country where everybody's
abused at least in that way
so
yeah so the other thing that is a real
tell is that when you hear the
complaints of the
Palestinians they actually sound if you
were to take them an a context and you
didn't know why things were the way they
were it does sound pretty bad like
they're this their inability to use
roads uh their lack of access to as much
water those are real things but you know
what you know what is very much like
black lives
matter some of you remember that in the
early black lives matter days I was
hearing complaints that I thought you
know what some of those complaints sound
like things everybody would agree with
like uh let's have less police
brutality good I like that and how about
maybe we get everybody you know we help
fund uh police cams so they have body
cams that's good for everybody removes
any questions about what happened so I
thought to myself hey maybe I could be
useful I'll help black lives matter get
what they're asking for because that
sounds reasonable to me and then I
learned that black lives matter didn't
really have any interest in
Solutions yeah that's a longer story but
trust me when I say I'm not guessing
that they had no interest in Solutions I
found it out the hard way they had no
interest in Solutions whatsoever and I
think that uh the Palestinians have the
same problem if if black lives matter
had started with let's say a list of
three to five reasonable sounding
demands
and said from the beginning this is the
stuff we want we we want these five
things I think they would have found a
lot of
support I might have been one of them
you know if there were five reasonable
things um but where have you ever seen
the Palestinians put together their uh
you know their list of the five
reasonable things they
want to live good
lives of course not cuz because they're
not really dealing on the I want some
reasonable compromise level they want to
they want to kill all the Jews and take
over the land and satisfy their dead
ancestors and all that
stuff so here's the thing you need to
know about all the propaganda from
either the pro or anti-israel side it
always leaves out the other the other
side's
position so it's all just useless
 and that's why I
say you you can talk all day about how
things should be and what people should
do it's useless it's pure
power yeah the the Middle East is just
power and nobody does anything because
that's the right thing to do it's just
brainwashing and power and that's the
whole story so you don't even need to be
in favor of anything or against anything
it's just power so those with power will
control the land if that changes and
somebody else has the power they will
take that land that's that's your
future all right
um people want to disrupt the Western
prescribed nuclear family yeah I've
heard that they're doing a good job but
I also think that the nuclear family is
a historical Relic that will never
satisfy 7 5% of the public 25% is
perfect but 75% it just won't
work so we need some kind of a better
model for that but it's another story
hey everybody on YouTube thanks for
joining and uh I'll see you in the
morning tomorrow with more Fantastic
live streaming bye for now
