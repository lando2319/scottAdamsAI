welcome to the best thing that's ever
happened to you it's called coffee with
Scott Adams I might be a little bit
under prepared today but will that have
any impact whatsoever on the quality of
this
apparently it will because I didn't have
my microphone on for YouTube
how about that
how about that
all right let me call up your comments
here and we'll be
uh good to go
as soon as I do that
swear to God I'm going to be prepared
today and this is going to be the best
thing you've ever seen in your life
don't do the simultaneous sip without me
although I deserve it
I deserve it for my tardiness
all right I'm just going to call up some
comments here so that I can see them on
a separate screen
because that's how I roll
all right
anybody anybody would you like to do
these simultaneous sip
is there anybody here like yes yes I see
well if you'd like to do that
what you're going to need
there's a little something called the
copper mug or a glass of Tankard tell us
who started the canteen jungle flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
aren't you glad you got here for this
yeah you are go
oh yes feeling stronger every day
well in the news
a producer at CNN has been accused of
being a pedophile
they've got quite a bunch of evidence
about it and uh
apparently this particular
CNN producer
mostly worked with a political analyst
John Avalon
which means that when John Avalon Was
preparing to do his weekly anti-trump
pieces about how horrible a human
president Trump is
he was being prepared for that by a
pedophile
now
I just want to give you an update
um I have it on good authority that
there are still several people who work
as CNN who have not been accused of any
kind of sexual crime at all
several
so as soon as you say to yourself wait a
minute
I feel like they're all involved in some
kind of sex crime and or abetting
somebody who was accused of a sex crime
and that's not true
that's not true
uh what is true is that there are
several employees of CNN who have not
been accused of any sex crimes at all
and that's pretty good
you know sometimes I think that MSNBC is
nothing but
CNN but without all the sex crimes
seems like that's the main difference
um
so we got that going on
um wait I'm getting an update
okay cancel everything I just said
um
two questions
for you did I say this yesterday did I
just have it on
I can't remember if I said this or I
thought it
you ever been in that situation did I
say this already or did I think about
saying it you'll tell me in a minute
so I tweeted yesterday I think it was
after the live stream so I haven't said
it yet
if someone invented a technology that
eliminated your ability to make good
decisions
would you let them use it on you
in the comments if somebody made a
technology
that eliminated your ability to make
good decisions would you use it
you wouldn't use it
because that technology already exists
it's called the news
the the primary purpose of the news
in the current ERA
is to uh
to make it harder for you to make
decisions
am I wrong about that
that feels to be the primary purpose of
news now I feel like it used to be some
kind of a public good where we'd become
educated we'd become better citizens and
everything but it's not that anymore is
it it doesn't seem to be that it has any
kind of
public good purpose in fact it seems
like a
you know some kind of a virus that the
public is having to deal with
so if you follow the news as I do
uh you're in the same boat that you're
willingly submitted to a technology that
is designed to make you less able to
make good decisions because it's
designed to confuse you it is propaganda
by you know by Design it's not
accidental
So speaking of propaganda
um the Jesse's molette case
I think you've all realized is much
bigger than a case about one person
because our brains are organized in such
a way
that we like to thank any one example of
something is really representative of
the whole
and the Democrats had this very
successful
let's say narrative going on that
Republicans were a bunch of racists and
you live in a racist country and a bunch
of white nationalists were doing a bunch
of racist stuff and and you really
needed to understand that before you
voted
but
because this Jesse Smollett thing became
such a big story it's kind of the first
thing you're going to think about the
next time you hear that some black
person is alleging that there was a
racial crime against them
am I right
it'll be the first thing you think of be
just because it's such a high profile
case now that's not fair right we live
in a world where awful things are
happening all over all the time and
they're real they're not fake There's
real awful stuff happening but
your brain is going to automatically go
to the most you know shiny object and
that happens to be this case so if you
were a Democrat and you were you know
thinking at the the highest level of
strategy
you'd be a little bit worried about this
wouldn't you
that this one case makes it look like
maybe their whole narrative was
I'm not saying it is but it's going to
feel like it and that's really damaging
to their whole story that they're the
good guys and the Republicans are the
bad guys
so how do you fix something that
absolutely can't be fixed because this
is unambiguously a hoax
unambiguously he was trying to frame
um Maga people
unambiguously it was anti-trump
supporter
unambiguously it was designed
to make people
hate Trump supporters in a way that
could be violent in the long run I mean
if you believe that this sort of thing
was happening
it would be easy to get violent in
response to it if he thought it was real
if you thought it was part of a trend
that's what the news was telling you
so given that this all blew up in the
faces of all all the people who thought
it was real how do you fix it
and I saw David Axelrod tweet that is so
clever and I mean that like legitimately
I think there are only maybe
five people on the Democrat side
who could do what David Axelrod did in
this tweet
now it's not good enough and and I
laughed for 10 minutes when I read it
but it is such a good try
in the in the face of an impossible task
it's such a good try I'm going to read
it to you because you know he's
operating at sort of the highest level
of you know communication and strategy
within the Democrats he's one of maybe
five people who can do this sort of
thing
and this this is what he said uh
he said that Jesse's Millet inexcusably
slandered our city meaning Chicago to
advance his career today a jury held him
accountable for that scheme
so
it feels as though
David Axelrod is very cleverly trying to
make us look like make us think that the
problem here was not that Jesse's Millet
was
slandering Trump supporters which is
exactly what was happening like not a
little bit not a dog whistle
it's like literally exactly what was
happening at the Axelrod has changed
that to slandering our city
is that what happened
did any of you watch this story and say
to yourself my God
what has he done to slander Chicago
literally no one had that feeling
literally no one but
what are you gonna do I mean there's
nothing about this story that you can
you can hold on to that's like the good
side for your your narrative
but man that's a good try
I mean it's a failure but it's a hell of
a try he inexcusably slandered our city
slandered our city
nothing like that happened
well I mean you could argue it happened
but it would be what the fourth thing
you'd worry about on the list of things
you're worrying about
so uh I had a good laugh about that and
again I would say he's one of maybe five
people on the Democrat side who could
even get that close to some kind of a
reframe of the situation but uh it sort
of is brilliant in its failure
because I don't think you could have
done a better job
and
yeah they're trying to change the uh the
motive to advancing his career well that
was part of it but I think you did have
some social intentions we don't know we
can't read his mind right so there's no
way to know what he was thinking
um
one of the funniest things I read about
that case today was one of the things
that the police were very suspicious
about
is that when he got home his Subway
sandwich was fully intact
hahaha
he was a victim of this brutal hate
crime
and he had to get home and and his
Subway sandwich just fine
and I'm thinking that's good police work
they're looking at that sandwich and
they're thinking
so you were the victim of a brutal hate
crime
but you protected your sandwich
and so that was sort of a tell
um
it's funny how often Subway
gets dragged into some terrible story
haven't they had like uh two
spokesperson so far who got accused of
hey this crimes
I always feel sorry for Subway because
they're just trying to mind their own
business you know sell you some
sandwiches we we just want to sell you
some damn sandwiches can you leave us
out of the news
sandwich you sandwich stomach
that's it we'd like to keep our our
entire brand focused on the sandwich
part of it but no Subway just keeps
dragging back into these heinous crime
stories
all right
as I was noting
uh recently and tell me if this is the
same where you live
so where I live or anywhere that I could
drive to in my area
um mask compliance at restaurants is
basically zero
meaning that you put it on to talk to
the hostess you sit down you take it off
and and then you're done you might put
it on when you're leaving but nobody's
going to care because you're already
leaving
what are they going to kick you out if
you try to leave the restaurant without
your mask are they going to say I'm
sorry you can't leave this restaurant
not until you put that mask on oh what
are they going to do I mean they'd have
to say can you get out of here right
away and you'd say well that's what I'm
doing
I'm walking from here to the door
so
I the reason I bring this up
is now restaurants were probably the
weakest link right in the you know the
the mandatory stuff restaurants were
going to go first I think because the
restaurant owners a lot of them are
independents and a lot of them just said
no I can't compete that way because the
restaurant right across the street I
don't think they're going to be too
tough on masks so if I'm tough on masks
and the restaurant directly across the
street is not
I'm done
so the market pretty much forced the
restaurants to ignore the mandatory mask
thing I mean the employees wear them
you know and not all of them you'll see
some some people who are not wearing
them even to work there
but here's what I want to remind you
there are two problems about the
mandatory restrictions
one is all the problems of the mandatory
restrictions you know the physical
things that prevent you from doing
but the second part is how it feels
am I right
it's not just bad enough that they're
restricting you from doing all this
you want to do that's bad because you
can't do the stuff
or you or you have to wear a mask and
it's uncomfortable but I'll tell you one
of the biggest problems is is it feeling
like somebody made you do it
and doesn't that really get under your
skin
it's not my choice and I wouldn't have
chosen this they're making me do it
light just pisses you off right so let
me tell you something just to make you
feel better about that part
the public already decided they weren't
going to wear masks in restaurants and
then what happened
no mass in restaurants
as soon as the public by some kind of
you know hidden majority that we don't
know exactly as soon as the public by
some kind of majority or it might even
been a plurality or something like that
we don't know what percentage tips
things
but as soon as the public decided
it was completely over
there was no fight
there was no pushback the public just
said no no we're gonna go eat at
restaurants and we're gonna take our
mask off the whole time and that's what
we're gonna do
the public has all the power
everything that's still mandatory that
you don't like is because your fellow
public hasn't quite gotten there yet
as soon as they do
than the public then the government will
have no power whatsoever so if you
imagine you're being suppressed by your
government
not exactly
it feels like it that's not what's going
on at all
you are being suppressed
by the fact that the percentage of your
fellow citizens has not yet reached the
Tipping Point
when it does
Boop it's going to be all over yeah you
think there was a slippery slope toward
mandatory
where do you see the slippery slope away
from it
right and we're right I feel like we're
we're not at the Tipping Point but we're
approaching it
we're approaching the Tipping Point and
here's what's going to push me over the
edge
um I'm not going to get a booster shot
if if the big Pharma can't tell me if
getting the Omicron virus is more or
less dangerous than a booster shot
they don't know that
why would I get a booster shot when
Snopes I know I know you're going to
tell me snopes is not reliable but I'll
bet you think it's reliable when it goes
against the Democrats
right and that's what it's doing snopes
is saying that there are zero reported
deaths of Omicron anywhere in the world
doesn't mean there are none
zero reported confirmed cases
zero
did you hear zero
zero
[Laughter]
whole whole Galaxy
zero now there might be some I don't
know because the uh over at the UK some
experts are saying that the Omicron
could kill 25 to 75 000 people in the UK
alone
at the same time
at the same time
the Omicron virus is totally overtaking
the others in some cases where it's you
know where it's prevalent it's 75 of the
infections already I think in was it
South Africa that's the case or at least
of what they were monitoring right so
that these are still just little bubbles
but we should probably see the Omicron
take over everything reasonably soon
unless there's yet another better you
know more more capable virus but it
would have to act fast because the
omicron's region
and
um as long as that thing's raging
and it's killing zero and probably
confers some kind of immunity that
matters against the the worser strains
uh
I'm done with the booster now if science
in some credible way you know I'd have
to see more than one study or one
opinion
but if I could be convinced and I think
I could that in fact the booster is
safer than the Omicron or at least that
it's a toss-up
well I might modify my opinion I might
but at the moment a booster shot would
be stupid
if you think you can wait it out until
the Omicron is is you know the main
thing
then I'd wait it down
uh let's get rid of this on
YouTube
hide you on that channel
I was just going to talk about these
horrible people and then you showed
yourself so you reminded me
um I'm blocking anyone who says the
dumbest thing in the world which
is hey Scott's finally waking up
no the data is changing the Situation's
changed
what we knew in the fog of War stage is
very very different from what we know
today right
and all of you who
think that it was always obvious the
whole time and I'm just waking up
and somebody said today even the normies
are getting it now no I'm not
getting anything the data has completely
changed
right
completely changed if your opinion is
exactly the same well all the data has
changed there's something wrong with you
now it could be that the data changed in
your favor and you know you got lucky
but if your opinion
with no data was complete certainty that
blah blah blah you shouldn't give
vaccinations or whatever you're not
doing a good job of thinking
because you didn't know we were all
guessing
we're still guessing
but we have way more information to
inform our guests at this point
all right so
um that's where that's where I'm going
to take a stand I think and again it
could change tomorrow
by tomorrow I could say oh new data
changed my mind so I'm going to reserve
that option
I like to change my mind when the data
changes
um so I'll probably do that
all right
um
is inflation transitory
what do you think I'll put this to you
um some some on the Democrat side would
have us believe that the inflation is
transitory
uh what do you think
well I think it is because everything's
transitory
it's just how you define transitory I
suppose there's no such thing as
permanent inflation
you know eventually the sun will burn
out and
and the Earth will be a cold dead lump
of coal
so I mean yeah I guess you'd have to
define transitory if it's transitory
over the next five years would you call
that transitory
if if inflation continued to be a
problem let's say for five years but
then it calmed down is that transitory
now transitory feels like less than a
year doesn't it
I feel like that's what that feels so I
doubt there's anything that's transitory
but let me give you some context here
using my vast economic experience I do
have a degree in economics I've got an
MBA from a good school so I'm not
completely incompetent talking about
this topic surprising
and here's what I know about inflation
nobody really knows how that works it
feels like it'd be the easiest thing in
the world right add more money to the
system you know juice the activity
you know demand will outstrip supply
reasonably predictable
prices go up
so the the mechanism of inflation is
pretty clear
but there are always these big surprises
for example
all of that makes sense but what if
tomorrow you know a fusion reactor comes
online and two years from now we've
everyone has one in their closet now
that's not going to happen but there
could be you know technical changes that
change everything
um
somebody paid ten dollars to get to get
blocked by me so the vector says wow it
took Scott this long to wake up to the
kovid Sham congrats Scott now you're
using your Noggin welcome to the plug
Club big guy
he paid ten dollars to say a comment
that I just said will get you blocked
I appreciate your money you're a
but thank you for the money
and you're hidden on this channel
all right anybody else want to want to
get blocked I'm in a blocking mood
thanks for the money
um I told you I had a degree in
economics I can take your money and I
can block you too
that's something I learned in economics
class
yes
anyway here's what I know about
inflation the experts are not good at at
predicting it do you remember when the
experts said oh no it's going to be
stagflation we'll have inflation and low
growth which can't really happen at the
same time except it did once
you know during the Carter
Administration so if we don't even know
exactly what caused stagflation and why
it doesn't get caused again and you know
what's coming at us will there be
another pandemic God knows so we're not
good at predicting this stuff but
one of the big
um so I let me say this
inflation ends up being a tax on the
poor and the middle class
am I right
now if you're in one of those categories
you saw your prices go way up your gas
prices probably your food prices right
you've noticed food food is through the
roof
and you didn't have much of any stocks
if you're in the lower or middle range
thanks Eddie
so
now let me tell you my experience so far
as a rich guy I'm just going to be
obnoxious in the
uh in the interest of full disclosure
and you know just be honest right
sometimes honesty is
 obnoxious
depending what you're talking about so
this is going to be obnoxious to a lot
of you but I think it's fair to say
I'm doing great
I've never done better financially
because my stocks are up
and
I don't know how much my gas price would
have to go up
to make a difference compared to how
much my net wealth has gone up because
of just owning stock
I'm doing great
so Joe Biden just put the biggest tax
I've ever seen on the poor
didn't affect me
I literally I've never done better than
Joe Biden's here
I didn't expect that you know if you
told me you know who did you do better
under
Trump or Biden
not even close
I got killed under Trump I got
slaughtered
financially I just I had my ass handed
to me mostly because you know getting
canceled for this or that you know you
can't do deals can't do speaking just
talking about but as soon as Biden came
in
uh people stopped hating me as much
because I wasn't as relevant talking
about Trump
and I you know I made one lucky move I
bought a bunch of stocks when they hit
their bottom
so suddenly like anybody who owns stocks
I'm thinking it's looking pretty good
and all the people who don't own stocks
the lower income people just absolutely
got
and it's not going to let up anytime
soon so I would think that the number
one thing that the Democrats have for
them is that they're the ones who are
trying to help the normal people get by
that's not happening
that's not happened but let me give you
the plus side
the economy is really screeching
despite inflation the economy is just
screaming and
um it's hard to hire people I mean that
you know you saw Kramer
Financial or investment expert Kramer
you you saw him say that this is the
strongest economy he's ever seen maybe
since out of the 60s or something and I
would agree with that I don't think I've
seen a stronger economy if you don't
count the inflation
if you don't count that if you do count
it it's only a great economy for people
you know at the top half maybe
maybe top 25 percent
so
um I just don't know what to think about
inflation but I hate ignoring it but it
looks like we're just gonna tax poor
people until it's not a problem anymore
so there's that
um
why are airplanes relatively safe
in terms of covet
I I keep going back to that because I
feel like everything we need to know
about covid you can learn on an airplane
am I wrong
because the thinking is that the reason
that air travel is safe enough is not
just that you know people are getting
tested and vaccinated that's helping a
lot but that people are wearing masks on
the airplane this is what the industry
would tell you the experts would say
it's because people wear masks on the
airplane except when they eat and that
their ventilation ventilation systems
are great
now that's true I think airplanes have
great ventilation they have to and one
of the one of the uh anecdotes of a
spread involved a jet that was idle on
an airport during a layover
and they turned the ventilation off for
half an hour
and the speculation is that that half
hour they turned off the ventilation is
when all the spread happened
maybe I don't know
but so I I was feeling pretty smart I'm
reading about this and thinking okay
okay I've got a pretty good grip on why
these airplanes are working or not
spreading so you got the masks good
don't disagree with me yet just wait
till I get to the end of this so you got
the masks okay okay that should make a
difference you got that great
ventilation good good you got the vet
the vaccinations now all right all right
and some people have natural immunity
that's good that's good and I thought
I'd covered all of the bases
like I'd consider all of the all the
variables
and then uh Twitter user named I love uh
I heart Pipelines
to either this
you're going to feel as dumb as I did
when you hear this
all right
this is just like a guy on Twitter
and he's going to say something and I'm
going to read it to you this is going to
make you slap your head and say
oh God that was obvious
people don't talk on airplanes
that's it
people don't talk on their place
as the main the main cause of
transmission is
talking
and I'm like I'm all I'm all into the
masks and the vaccinations and the
ventilation now I'm reading about their
their HEPA filters and I'm thinking huh
I wonder if it's the ventilation is it
is it the filtering or is it the airflow
and I'm like I'm like into the science
and and then the I Heart pipeline
says
I don't fly much but I don't think
people talk much on planes
 you for being so smart
how in the world did we miss that
seriously how did we miss that
yeah you're still breathing but but the
the best thinking is that it's the
talking that makes a difference
is anybody having the same experience
that how did we analyze this and this is
the first time I've ever heard this I've
never heard anybody say
but you know the main way of gets
transmitted is from talking and people
don't talk much on airplanes
in fact the only person you talk to is
the person you probably came there with
and if they infected you you're already
infected
all right
um
I'm thinking you're putting together if
I ever got
I don't know less lazy a hoax IQ test
and what it would be is simply a list of
hoaxes
and you the test taker would simply
check whether you
um know it's a hoax or you believe it's
true and the fact that it's a hoax is a
hoax so you just say true or false to
each of the claims or the hoaxes
now why would I do that when I already
talk incessantly about all these hoaxes
and a lot of people know what they are
but not so much on the right
and the answer is because this this is a
persuasion trick to get people to think
past the yes or no if you give somebody
a hoax IQ test
and they start arguing with you about
whether or not they got the right answer
or the test itself is graded correctly
just don't even have the argument just
say thank you very much here's your
score
no no no I'm pretty sure that three of
those that I Mark really really happened
thank you very much here's your score
no seriously I know this one's not a
hoax I saw it with my own eyes heard it
with my own ears that one really
happened
here's your score thanks for taking the
test
yeah we're getting to the point where we
should stop arguing about them
just put them on a list
and use What I Call List persuasion
have you heard me describe list
persuasion it's a it's a persuasion
trick uh it is used the best
the best user of this is Sean Hannity
if you want to see a really good example
of it also uh Alex Jones
Alex Jones did it once on I was on his
uh program a few years ago and he did
that and I watched him do it it was just
sort of masterful really right I'm not
saying I approve of it I'm just saying
that the technique works and that when
you see it done it's really good and the
way the technique works is you list four
things that everybody listening believes
to be true
and then you slip one thing in that they
don't yet believe is true but you like
them to believe it's true
so uh
so let's see if I can come up with an
example off the top of my head this will
be hard because I'm just like winging it
here but let's say you were uh
you were going to say bad things about
Joe Biden
all right I'll just do a pretend Hannity
um so this won't be a real example just
just to make the case there are several
things you could say about
Joe Biden that are true or at least the
audience would accept as true
you say uh
Joe Biden is uh got is mentally
incompetent and the audience is like
that's what I see that's what I see
um he is a increased inflation
he is beholden to the progressives uh
you know he's got a real trouble with
them yeah true
um and he said some racist things in his
earlier days things that people thought
were racism yeah true and he's a a
lizard person from The Planet Krypton
you just you just like throw it in there
but you never put it at the end
so it's never the first one and it's
never the last one you always sandwich
it in the middle list toward toward like
closer to the end because you want
people to hear three true things then
the lizard person uh accusation and then
two more two more uh real things if you
sandwich the lizard the lizard person
thing between three trues and two more
truths it just slips right past your
defenses until you're pretty sure it
must be true it was on that list so that
would be the same technique with using
the height hoax IQ test but but an
ethical use of it because as far as I
know there would really be real hoaxes
right so it wouldn't be trying to trick
anybody you'd be trying to persuade them
here's a weird story because the
simulation loves us
um when right right leaning and I guess
CNN would call them far-right companies
yet de-platformed and that sort of thing
where do they go where does the gab go
and where do a lot of people get deep
platforms well they go to a a server
company called Epic epik
and the founder of that is a free speech
Advocate and is willing to take people
onto his system
so that they can still be in business
um and he's not as concerned about their
you know horrible speech
but he has banned he has banned some you
know direct Nazi type organizations but
not everybody who likes Nazis apparently
so so it's a pretty rough uh group over
there along with regular people so
there's lots of normies
but it's a little little extra
a little extra bad compared to the rest
of the world
um but you can use your own judgment
whether that's free speech or something
worse
now the the individual who does this is
sort of fascinating I guess his parents
were both you know anti-nazi activists
and he's got a he's got a pretty good
case
that he doesn't lean that way himself
now you'd have to suspect right so the
people on the left are like we're not so
sure because you do seem to be helping
those people on the right
um
all right
um
and
here's the the payoff
the name of this individual who owns
this company called Epic
who the people on the left would like to
demonize to you know de-platform for
good anybody who's got views they don't
like
this is his actual name
his last name is monster
m-o-n-s-t-e-r
and his first name is Rob
now I would call myself Bob
if my last name was monster
because monster is bad enough but Rob is
actually a crime you don't want to rob
people and you don't want to be a
monster so Rob monster
is the name of this this is actual real
name like the name he was born with
now I don't have anything bad to say
about him
I just think it's interesting that
people who do think he's a monster
well that's his actual name
and apparently is a common name in the
country where was he from
I don't know he's from some European
country
all right
Chris Christie is positive that Trump
gave him covet when they were doing
their debate preparation and Christy was
playing Biden and I guess you know there
was a lot of he said it was a spirited
debate practice so there was a lot of
spittle going back and forth and now
that we know the timeline it looks like
uh Trump probably infected several
people in the room so Christy Steve
Miller I think there were some other
people
and
uh
and
what this story fails to mention give me
a fact check on this
isn't the story that Trump tested
positive but then when he did a higher
quality test he tested negative
is that true
and did then was the debate before or
after those two tests
because the the thinking is that Trump
knew which means they had to be after
the first asked but wasn't also after
the second test when he was tested
negative
um
does anybody know that
how could you know that yeah I know so
so
um I would love to know about the
ventilation in that room
because I'll bet I'll bet the
ventilation wasn't working so I still
have a theory that uh the difference is
the air flow not just the filtering and
the ventilation so I'm gonna I'm Gonna
Keep on my theory that airflow is the
only thing that matters
and if you've got the airflow right
you'd be fine we'd be done
that's what I believe
I don't have data to back that up but
everything is pointing in that direction
um
do you realize that I mean Chris
Christie actually went to the ICU
Trump could have actually killed them
Trump but Trump might have actually
killed
Chris Christie it was close and and
Trump himself had a tough time with the
virus so both Christy and Trump could
have died
now of course they had the best health
care
so the odds were against it in their
cases but
um
all right
there were multiple tornadoes that
ripped through Kentucky and several
other states Arkansas Illinois and
there's not much to say about that but
50 people dead good Lord
I guess the only the only thing I'd like
to say on this is
you have to worry about the the one you
don't hear have you heard this old thing
about the military if you hear the
bullet like
then it didn't get you
because you the one that gets you you
don't hear I'm not sure that's true
because you know if it was a sniper I
think you'd hear it before
wouldn't you if it was a sniper at a
distance wouldn't you hear it before I
hear you I don't know maybe
no oh I'm seeing people say no I think
this crowd knows guns more than I do
no okay so let's stick with it that you
don't hear the one that gets you this
tornado situation reminds me of that
so you know probably the 50 people who
died were worried about other things
don't you think
they were worried about other things and
I'll bet none of those other things
would have killed them I bet they
wouldn't have died of covid
you know I'll bet they wouldn't have
died and uh climate change disaster
about whatever they were worried about
wasn't the thing and I always like to
remind myself of that because you find
yourself getting all worked up worrying
about something
like climate change or you know
something's going to kill you that's big
in the world you know there's going to
be a war Kim Jong-un is going to bomb
you any minute whatever
um Almost Never
can you see it coming
Almost Never
please study PCR tests I'm not going to
do that
uh I I know if if where you're going on
this is it the uh
is that the uh pandemic is fake and the
tests are picking up
that's really a dumb
hypothesis
at this point in the beginning it was
you know you throw it in with everything
else because everything was confusing
but at this point if you're still
bitching about the PCR test I think
you're
you know I think events have left you
behind is what I think now I don't mean
to be condescending if it sounds like
that that's not my intention because I
think everybody's confused about all of
this stuff but if you're reading if
you're reading stuff
uh
about the tests being bad
um yeah I agree that we're probably
doing a bad job of counting stuff but
here's the problem the icus are
clearly being impacted where there are
waves of covet that's not imaginary
it's not imaginary
so although the PCR tests you know may
have some problems
it's a real pandemic so I just wouldn't
spend any time on that
path
uh my friend who got monoclonal he's
good as far as I know he was on the mend
Scott's finally waking up to tornadoes
um
sniper would
it's true I work in a hospital so Doc
Bailey you're saying it's true that it's
obvious that covet is real and because
you don't hear front line people saying
it's not real do you
hear dear anybody who actually deals
with covet patients saying you know
I don't think these are real
I think the PCR test was wrong or
something like that
yeah somebody has a registered nurse who
is a wife and
she's quite sure it's real
Cove is real just over hyped well every
danger is overhyped
if it's in the news it's over hyped
because that's where the money is
the inventor of PCR said they shouldn't
be used the way yeah yeah yeah yeah
it's a real pandemic
blah blah blah blah tests I don't care I
mean you might be completely right
it doesn't doesn't seem relevant
it's not like we're wondering if there's
a pandemic
um you do hear the front line talk about
heart issues in the young that's true
yes I would say that the uh oh here's a
good question that somebody asked me
let's let's I'll let you deal with this
too
rifle bullets are faster than sound
Sparky says thank you
there is some disagreement on this but
I'm not the expert so
um
trouble with these super chats is
they're really disruptive to the flow of
thought
uh and I believe I just lost my flow of
thought
oh uh it'll come back
um
yesterday I tweeted that it seemed like
we stopped hearing about long covet
is that do you find that it seems like
the news was a lot about long covet and
then the news I'm not talking about the
reality and just talking about the news
coverage I feel like the news just
stopped talking about it
when it was actually maybe one of the
biggest variables for my decision to get
vaccinated
and we we're talking about all the other
stuff
but it seems like the biggest one of the
biggest variables other than death and
um
oh most rifle bullets are faster than
sound okay thank you
so I tweeted that to see if other people
were having that experience and I was
again I was just talking about the
reporting of it not the actuality but it
did make me wonder if the actuality had
disappeared you know did we just stop
thinking it existed but there were
plenty of people who gave me uh links
and anecdotes and a lot of people have
experienced it themselves Etc so I think
we can say that long covet is real how
many of you would agree with that
statement
that long covered Israel yes yes yes
before you say it yes yes yes before you
say it vaccinations could give you
long-term problems too please don't tell
me that
please know that I knew that okay I'm
begging you
I'm begging you don't say the obvious
NPC thing well vaccinations are bad too
I know I know I know
all right uh yeah so I think everybody
believes law and covet is real not that
it necessarily would change your
decision at this point
all right the question that I forgot
about was
um
how many anecdotal reports
would it take to sway you if you didn't
have good scientific studies
and let me let me walk you through it
let's say you walk out your back door
and a bird shits on your head
and you say to yourself what bad luck
but obviously it's not any kind of a
trend or anything
so the next day you walk out of your
front door going to work and a bird
shits on your head two days in a row and
you say to yourself damn it
that is a big coincidence
Third Day Birds yesterday you had fourth
a Burgess in your head let me do a
survey for you
how many times does the bird have to
shed on your hat before you say okay
there's something going on here
not once I think every one of you would
discount one
how about two
if I haven't twice in a row
would you automatically conclude this is
not a coincidence
um
how many of you would
some of you would go at two
some of you would call it five or six
I don't know what to say about that
I'm pretty sure if if I got on five
times in a row walking out the same door
I don't know if I would get the six
I think I would I'm pretty sure I would
tap out after three
but it's funny seeing all the
differences in the and the answers
now my my example is meant to be
artificially constrained right and in
that case I think it would only take me
two
right I I think I'd be I probably would
never use that door again after the
second time
that's just me but if you're looking at
like a global thing you know it's not
about you and your house you're looking
at you know lots of population of people
and stuff it should take you more
anecdotes
so in the context of uh I don't know
five billion people who might get
vaccinated how many anecdotes of bad
outcomes would it take
to convince yourself that 5 billion
people
shouldn't get vaccinated how many
anecdotes would it take give me a number
give me a number
a hundred
a thousand ten thousand a hundred
thousand a million what would it take
somebody says zero I'm Millions
some people say zero
a thousand so if a thousand people had a
bad outcome you would would you cancel
the vaccination
because that would cancel every
vaccination you know for everything I
think right doesn't every vaccination
kill a thousand people like eventually
uh
someone's trying to tell me that Russia
and China are invading Ukraine uh nice
try
nice try
all right well
so it when I when I put it that way it's
hard to come up with a number right so
my point is you could easily think that
um two dozen reports tell you something
you could easily think that a hundred
adverse reports
is telling you something it probably
isn't how about a thousand adverse
reports and let's say they're pretty
well documented let's say they're in the
vares database which means a doctor had
to fill out paperwork so there's a
professional who has something at risk
um let's say ten thousand
what if you knew for sure
there were 10 000 reports of adverse
let's say death
from the shots does that mean you
shouldn't take them
how about a hundred thousand
here is the really
bad bad thing
suppose you're the leader of a country
and your experts tell you
don't tell the public
but the only way we're going to get
through this pandemic
without losing 10 million people
is to lose a million through the
vaccination now I'm not aware of any
numbers that would support what I'm
saying I'm just giving you numbers to do
the math there's no reality Behind These
that I know of
but what if behind closed doors
they said we're positive this is going
to kill 10 to 20 million Americans
the only way to stop it is with
vaccinations that will kill a million
different people
probably it won't be the same people who
the virus would have killed it's a
million people who probably would have
been fine
but you might save 11 to 19 million
Americans
what do you do
you tell the Americans what their actual
risk is
look here's the deal people you get the
vaccination a million of you are going
to die a million of you
but we're pretty sure we can save
tens of Millions
pretty sure nothing's a hundred percent
but we're very very sure
what would you do as a leader would you
tell people
or would you fudge the data
and say we'll give you all the data in
75 years
when everybody involved in the decision
making is dead
but
uh just you know don't ask too many
questions it's looking fine it's
vaccinations are good
because I feel like that's what happened
not the Million number and not the 10
million number I'm making up numbers but
I feel as if the truth
is that our government knew that these
vaccinations and the experts knew and
told the government would be far more
dangerous than ordinary vaccines and it
still made sense
and it still made sense
the the stratified risk thing is a
scandal of
unlimited proportions in my mind but
it's a separate question
why is vaccines being pushed on kids uh
follow the money there can't be any
other reason can you think of a reason
other than following the money I can't
now the the idea was that we would
sacrifice the young to save the old
do you think that the government could
tell you that that's actually what
they're doing
here's the deal we know
that we're going to kill a bunch of
children
but we have a pretty good feeling that
if we kill a bunch of children we can
save even more older people
I feel like that's that was a conscious
decision
but you see that these decisions can't
be sold right you can't go to the public
and say we're going to kill a million of
you to save 20 million that's a no sale
that is no sale
even if
it was the best thing for the country
You could argue it but you can't sell it
I think you have to lie to sell it
and I think that a lot of a lot of what
we saw in the so-called leadership about
this was our leaders lying intentionally
for what they thought was our own good
in some cases probably money was the
influence but
when they lied about the masks
that was for our own good it wasn't it
allegedly but we know it happened they
lied to our faces for our own good don't
you think that they're lying about the
vaccinations too
for our own good
I do
I do now
here's where I get in trouble
right because there seems to be a binary
like there always is Right vaccinations
are good and safe
where vaccinations are very unsafe and
bad
I have neither of those feelings
I feel that they're probably less safe
than just about anything we've ever done
medically
and
might have been the right leadership
decision
because I don't think you could have
sold that proposition it was an
unsellable proposition
so you either let 20 million people die
and you know destroy the economy that
ends up destroying another you know 10
million people by indirect effects or
you lie to the public
for their own good
for their own good just like the masks
you don't think your government would do
that I do
I I think that there were at least
elements of the government not
necessarily the president you know I'm
not sure who tells the president what
but I have a feeling that there were
enough people involved in decision
making that they knew it was way more
dangerous than medicine in general
still worthwhile
in their opinions
but they never could have sold that to
the public
Adam
saying Scott's finally waking up to
people lying finally I've learned that
lesson
I lived my whole life without
understanding
that people can lie
risk of losing credibility is too high
nope
nope apparently the risk of losing
credibility is not driving anything
because their credibility is gone I
don't you can't lose what you didn't
have
um
Scott wants to kill the young and strong
to save the old and weak
there's your mind reading of the day
incorrect of course
I've said explicitly that one of the
reasons that I volunteered to get the
vaccination is it would save other
people not necessarily just older people
um they don't care about credibility
yeah
it is weird how often our public
servants lie yeah for various reasons
either for their own or for they think
it's for our good
you know the the old line you can't
handle the truth
um
that's true
all right
how about
uh do you have any questions because I
think I'm done with my prepared
thoughts
how angry are the kids about all this I
think they're just used to it
I think they're used to it
I'm going to give you uh a story that
drives a lot of my decision making it's
called the Indian
uh elephant trainer
so over in India
there are some people who train
elephants and one of the things that
always confused me is why does a big old
elephant do what a tiny human being
tells it to do
instead of just like killing the human
and the answer is that they train them
when they're babies
so the elephant trainer you know is
going to be beaten on the baby elephants
you know to make it do what he wants it
to do until the baby elephant is afraid
of it
and then the elephant grows up and is
still thinks that this little tiny human
can hurt it
well it can hurt it if the elephant
doesn't fight back but if it did fight
back it wouldn't be a fair fight right a
human with a club versus elephant
but this works because the elephant has
been trained that it is helpless to this
little human
that's us right now
we're the elephant the public
the government is the tiny little human
who's been beating us since we were
children
and when they tell us to lock down
where that elephant and we're like okay
they beat me when I was a baby and now
they're saying they're going to beat me
again
a better lock down
but don't forget
don't ever forget
you're the elephant
the government
is that thing that you can squash with
your foot
but the elephant can't do
unless all the parts of the elephant are
thinking the same way
right so we're an elephant but we're an
elephant that hasn't made up its mind
or it's been trained not to think
the elephant is getting ready to wake up
so you can talk all day about me waking
up but I'm not your problem
the elephant is waking up
and the Elephant is going to get rid of
the mandates it's going to get rid of
the masks when it's ready
so just remember
you're the elephant
you have all the power
you have all the power you just have to
get it organized and move it in the
right direction so that's your thought
through the day you are the elephant you
know that have a great weekend
