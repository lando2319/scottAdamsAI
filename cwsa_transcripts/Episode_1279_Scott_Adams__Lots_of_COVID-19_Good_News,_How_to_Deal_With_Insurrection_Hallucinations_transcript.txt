hey everybody
come on in come on in thanks for getting
here early
you know who you are all you early birds
appreciate it
today will be one of one of
the best coffees wisconsin adams you've
ever seen
yep there have been hundreds of them
but this will be one of the best promise
and if you'd like to make this
a better one like even better than it's
going to be
and you wouldn't even have to do this i
mean this is just extra
you wouldn't even need to have the
simultaneous sip today but don't worry
you'll have one
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass to tank your chelsea steiner
canteen joker flashlight vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the coronavirus got some good
news today
go
ah yeah i can feel the pandemic receding
so let's start with the good news do you
want how about
all good news today i think i can
deliver that actually
i think i might actually be giving you
all good news today
i think no that's not true but let's
start with the good news uh israel has
shown
that the viral load from covet
was reduced four-fold on average for uh
people who had already gotten uh the
vaccination
so big question was this the big
question
if you get the vaccination are you still
a carrier of
the virus and the answer is yes
but not so much so it matters how much
and the good news is that the
vaccination does
exactly what you would think it would do
it it greatly reduces the amount of
virus in the person
and therefore presumably would greatly
reduce the amount of
viral infections so not only will the
vaccinations reduce
the number of deaths and
hospitalizations
but it will also decrease the amount of
spread
apparently a lot we don't know the exact
number but if it's a four-fold decrease
in uh virus that's probably a lot
probably a lot here's the other good
news there was a randomized
controlled study that's the good kind
the kind that you should pay attention
to now if there's only one of them
yes you still would like to see some
confirmation
from at least one other study by having
even one peer-reviewed randomized
controlled study is better than none
better than none and one of the things
that they found is that this drug called
budesinide
looks like it can reduce the risk of
hospitalization by 90 percent
if you get it early did you just hear
that
there's a common already available drug
how available is it i have some
right here now i this is a prescription
and i use it for a different purpose
what i use it for
is i had sinus surgery
last summer and to keep my sinuses open
it's a kind of a cordov steroid thing i
think
and it just keeps polyps from forming in
my sinus
so i use a different form of it i don't
use the inhalant i use a liquid form
that i put in a nutty pot blah blah
but the point is this is a common
a common drug that asthmatics use
i don't use it for that i have asthma
coincidentally
but um if this
is true and it is a randomized
controlled
trial right and and randomized
controlled trials
are pretty good and even if it were not
randomized and controlled if you get
something like a 90
difference i mean you don't even need
many controls
to know you got something if you've got
a 90 difference
if you had a if you had a 20 difference
then i'd be worrying about the quality
of the study and you know all the
details
but a 90 difference a 90
difference in a randomized controlled
trial
i don't know how that could be wrong i
mean anything's possible right but
it's hard to imagine that could be wrong
so here's the good news for the country
the good news is we may have a widely
available
drug that takes 90 percent of the risk
away from people who have early symptoms
which in in conjunction with the
vaccinations
this is the best place we've ever been
this is the best place we've ever been
somebody's saying that the buddha night
is sold under the brand name
pullman court that sounds right i think
that's right
um so here's the bad news
um i already take some just
prescription meds like one for acid
reflux etc
and some of my meds were very restricted
for the past
um year or so because the pandemic made
it hard to get meds
now i don't know where this is
manufactured
the company is cipla let's see if it
tells me somewhere where it's
manufactured
oh
i did not see this coming
are you ready for this
this this drug budesinide
now this is the in the suspension type
so i assume that they also make the
inhalant
but at least they have access to the
drug company called cipla
cipla and if it's true
that this can reduce you know the risk
of hospitalizations by 90 percent
this is made manufactured for sipla
wait um manufactured by
cipla so it's an american company but
it's manufactured in india
manufactured in india but an american
company
so can an american company control
how much we get from india i would
imagine india is
going to clamp down on their control now
so what we don't know is where the raw
materials come from
maybe that's the problem the the
precursors would be a problem
you know the chemicals that go into
making this chemical they might come
from china
so we'll see but at least it's a
friendly nation
india so that's better than china
all right i mean this is the best day
it is the best day for the pandemic
it's the best day this is the day that
it looks like
a human ingenuity just uh
just built the nuclear bomb it's like
world war
ii and the uh the manhattan project just
came in
so the vaccinations were kind of the
manhattan project
but they needed this other thing what
you really needed
was something that would also treat the
people who got it
not just the vaccination and we might
have it
we might have it now the bad news is if
this drug is
unavailable to me i won't be able to
breathe for the next year
so the quality of my life may have
just decreased substantially but the
quality of the country will be
substantially improved and i'm willing
to
i'm willing to take that trade off i
hope you would be too
uh i hope it doesn't kill me all right
biden has a plan apparently to open only
half of the schools
in the country and only one day a week
by the end of april
does that sound good enough to you all
right i keep seeing in the comments
people saying uh hydroxychloroquine
hydroxychloroquine
hydroxychlorine queen did not have a
randomized control trial
all right if hydroxychloroquine had a
randomized control
trial then we'd be talking about that
but we'll see you know if you're being
uh if you're critical of the
buddhesonide story that it might turn
out not to be true
you could be right it could turn out to
not be true
uh but i'm gonna i'm gonna go with
optimism for today
so biden's plan is to open half of the
schools by april one day a week which is
not nearly enough doesn't really even
address
i would say it doesn't address any of
the problem does it
do you think your kids are suddenly
going to get healthy and smarter because
school is open one day a week
not really somebody says siplet is in
fact an
indian company well i'm going to read
the
oh you know you might be right because
the the packaging
is cleverly ambiguous
here's what it says manufactured for
colon
ciphla usa
so it's manufactured for cipla usa
does that mean it's a u.s company
somebody's saying here's an indian
company
could an indian company just make the
name of their company
simply usa i think they could right
there's nothing that would stop them
from doing that
so somebody says it is a u.s subsidiary
manufactured for an american subsidiary
well so okay so it's something like that
we'll figure it out by the end of today
so i'm wondering if biden's plan
uh being very short of what the public
wants i mean not even close to what the
public wants
i wonder if it's because of a lack of
ppe and protective stuff
is it a lack of funding is that what the
problem is
because if so then i think you could put
some of that back on
the trump administration couldn't you
because it's not
it's not today that they find themselves
unprepared
they've probably been unprepared for
months so if they're
if the reason that biden can't open
things is because the schools
are not funded well enough to have the
preparations
that's that's a trump administration
issue
because they should have been ready by
now you know and if they didn't give
funding
you got to blame the boss so biden and
trump i think have to take
some equal measure of this being a
complete failure
and i would say that the school
reopening issue is a complete failure of
government
it's a complete failure of government
because it's the teachers unions as you
know
who are keeping schools closed doing a
good job maybe for their
members i could see why a union would
want to act that way
but the country is just getting
strangled
if you have not observed yet a child
breaking down
because of the the current lack of
social
structure where do you see it in person
where do you see what it's doing to kids
it's really
it's really messing with people i would
say that
this week i like to consider myself
mentally strong and you know even if i'm
not i like to
i like to have that as my my view of
myself
because i think it maybe maybe helps
make me mentally stronger
if you believe you're mentally strong i
think it helps be
mentally stronger but i gotta say
this pandemic's starting to get to me
i've had good days and bad days but i
gotta say
if if the pandemic's getting to me
it's really messing with people who are
not as
you know i guess i'm complimenting
myself here
i feel like i am mentally strong
and if it's getting to me i can only
imagine what it's doing to people who
are
in a worse situation i mean yeah
tell me in the comments show me in the
comments where you're
at uh and let's say mental health-wise
where are you at mental health-wise let
me
show me in the comments
i'm seeing lots of comments uh asking me
to talk about ivermectin
ivermectin and hydro hydroxychloroquine
it's the same story
there are uh reports that it's good
but we don't have the randomized
controlled trials to
to know so i would not be betting
anything on ivermectin or
hydroxychloroquine at this point
if either of them were the big deal that
we hoped they were
we would know it by now and we don't
um oh look at that i'm looking at your
comments and i'm
i'm actually impressed at how many of
you are doing well but
not all of you somebody's a six out of
ten somebody says
i'm somebody says they're broken
somebody says about to break hold on
hold on hold on
we'll get through this so if you're
close to breaking
hold on you'll be glad you did
seven out of ten fine worse worse i've
been so far
sorry about that if it wasn't crazy i'd
go insane
yeah imagine being poor and living in a
cramped
inner city housing yeah yeah i mean
i i try to imagine how this is for
people who are not as fortunate as i am
to be able to ride this out in
in relative luxury compared to other
people
and i almost can't imagine it it's
almost beyond my ability to imagine how
bad this must be
for a pretty big segment of the country
almost can't imagine it
i mean but we're headed in the right
direction all right
here's my favorite story of the day
uh and i'll give you some background in
this
i i think that we don't appreciate
enough
the value that our billionaire class
brings to the country because it's easy
to like hate the billionaires
right oh the hedge fund guys
the billionaires still no longer money
so
there's sort of an automatic automatic
reflex to be
anti-billionaire i get that and
certainly not all of our billionaires
are
are helping but it is true
that people who started without money
and made themselves billionaires doing
especially if they've done
more than one thing right if you've done
more than one thing and it got you to be
you'd be a billionaire like elon musk
perfect example
they have essentially proven themselves
superior let's say observers of reality
and understanding how things work that's
how they became billionaires no not all
of them
some of them just inherited or whatever
but a lot of our billionaire class
are really really valuable to the world
and the country really valuable and
when you see you know elon musk recently
offered a 100 million dollar prize for
the best
carbon capture how valuable is that
i mean seriously he did something the
government
couldn't do because he could
not only could he but he was smart
enough
to figure out what is the most important
thing i could make a difference on
and that he did it with a tweet i'll
give 100 million dollars for the best
the best uh carbon capture
and so it's no coincidence when you see
the billionaires doing things that are
smarter than what your government is
doing that's not a coincidence
there's no coincidence that's what made
them billionaires
that they can see reality a little bit
clearer
and they're willing to act on it
another example of this just made me
laugh it's the smallest issue
but it again it reinforces this idea
that a lot of billionaires became
billionaires
because they're really really smart
right you know whatever you want to say
about mark
zuckerberg the one thing you can't say
about
him is that he's a bad uh a bad ceo
right he's one of the best ceos of all
time
one of the best of all time even if you
don't like what facebook is doing
his his is just through the roof it's
crazy
and he and most people would agree with
that but here's here's my one of the day
so apparently the uh the mavericks
basketball team dallas mavericks
they have not been playing the national
anthem before games and people didn't
notice for something like 12 or 13 games
that they just didn't play the national
anthem now of course it wasn't a regular
spectator situation because it was a
reduced
reduced you know people in the stands
and stuff
so it was unusual situation but nobody
noticed
12 or 13 games nobody noticed
that there was no national anthem and
then when they noticed
the mavericks admitted that it's a
decision
and that it was mark cuban's decision
specifically as owner of the team
now here's my question to you
for how long have we been you know
yammering about
athletes kneeling and everybody's mad
and it's making us it's making us
further apart
and all that who and nobody who owned a
team
thought of this solution how about we
just don't play it
think about it why did nobody think of
that solution
why is mark why is mark cuban
the only person who owns a major team
who thought of the only solution that's
smart i just don't play it
now i ask you what is the purpose what's
the purpose
of playing the national anthem well one
of the purposes
is it's part of the propaganda
brainwashing
mechanism that any solid country does
the the pledge of pledge of allegiance
is a brainwashing
persuasion mechanism that i support 100
just because it's brainwashing doesn't
make it wrong
right it is absolute brainwashing
that's what it is it's invented for that
purpose and it works for that purpose
that's why we do it so the the flags and
the symbols and the patriotism are part
of
the programming that keeps a country
unified and strong
you need it you absolutely need it you
can't get rid of this brainwashing you
wouldn't want to
that everything would fall apart without
it
but given our current situation in which
the kneelers are
dividing us meaning some people are
anti-kneeler
because they they take the message as
anti-patriotism as opposed to
a message about the police and so it
divides us
what would be the point of having a
pledge of allegiance
its entire purpose is to give us better
unity
but once it stops serving that purpose
why would you keep doing it why would
you keep doing something for unity
that has exactly obviously the opposite
outcome at the moment now someday
someday they might go back to it and
that would be preferable
i think that'd be great but at the
moment
mark cuban is the only smart person in
the whole game
i didn't even think of this was there
even one point that you said to yourself
even one time during this whole
controversy about kneeling for the
national anthem
was there even one time you said to
yourself
maybe they should just skip it maybe
they should just skip it
probably not right but mark cuban did
and then he skipped it and it worked out
fine
now some of you are mad because it would
sound
uh anti-american anti-patriotic
it's not it's not anti-american
american is do what makes sense don't be
a idiot
if if i could give you one explanation
of what it means to be an american it
would be the following
do what makes sense don't be a
idiot
that's it that's like our our entire
national character could be summed up in
do what makes sense stop being a
idiot
that's it and mark mark cuban just did
that he just did what makes sense
because it doesn't make sense
to do a thing for unity when you know
for sure
it's doing the opposite
everybody else just kept doing it and
not once did i say to myself
and maybe you shouldn't maybe just skip
it now
if you're going to say he's being
anti-patriotic or
you know agreeing with china or
something that's just crazy this is just
a simple fix
to a simple problem um
here's how you should handle the
impeachment trial
are you ready for some advice i usually
don't give
advice because nobody
nobody takes advice it's like an
imaginary process
but here's the thing that's getting to
me
if you if you look at cnn they'll say
things
usually in the opinion place but they'll
say something
that their readers don't know is not
news because they can't
sort out opinion from real news and they
they say just matter-of-factly that the
president
incited an insurrection just matter of
factly like
well there's no question about that the
president incited an insurrection we'll
just put that out there like it's true
and it's a fact but here's the thing
we're having this national process to
impeach the president
for inciting an insurrection
but yet obviously
there was no insurrection where was the
insurrection
i know what happened on january 6th i've
seen the video i've seen all the
descriptions
i've seen the you know who's been
charged with what
but i haven't seen any insurrection i
haven't seen a coup attempt
where was that did you see one
what i saw was a guy in a viking hat
some guy with some twist ties
they took over an empty room because
what were they protesting in favor of
the current system being used properly
meaning a transparent election was there
anybody there who said
we don't care what the elections say we
don't care what the voters want
we want our leader in place no matter
what the vote was
there were none of them all about you
there was not one person who entered the
capitol building
who if you ask them hey look if we could
prove to you
that biden got more votes and he got
them in the right places
if we could prove it to your
satisfaction would you be okay
with him serving as president i'll bet
you a hundred percent of the people who
entered the camp
the capital would have said oh yeah
because
we like we like the constitution that's
why we're here
because we like the constitution we're
not trying to get rid of it
we're not trying to destroy the country
we're trying to make sure the country is
running the way it was designed
which is you know who got the most votes
and then that person serves as president
so you had a bunch of people who
unambiguously were doing the opposite of
a coup
they were trying to stop one
now the coup that they were trying to
stop could have been imaginary
could have been imaginary in other words
they imagined that the
the vote was rigged and that would have
been a coup
would it not if the vote had been rigged
in favor of biden and there's no
court proof of that happening i have to
say that so i don't get banned there's
no court proof of any rigging of the
election
at a scale big enough to change it
but what if it had there were a lot of
people who believed it
and they were trying to make sure that
the system had not been corrupted
so a bunch of people tried to make sure
that the current system exactly as it's
designed
is working properly explicitly that's
what they all wanted they just wanted a
little time for an audit
make sure we got the result that we
wanted
and that is being reported by the press
and now
the democrats were doing the impeachment
thing as an insurrection
nothing like that happened in your world
there was no insurrection not even close
nothing slightly like one
somebody says this is such a
disingenuous spin
says kyle so kyle
i'm going to talk about you and people
like you next
if you're trying to figure out what is
the right take or way to
to let's say communicate about the
current impeachment
it should be mocking because you should
be mocking the people who imagined
something that didn't happen
there's a whole impeachment process over
a thing that
you know didn't happen you don't even
have to wonder
it's all it's all on film you could
interview
anybody who went there and ask them the
following question
if you knew that the vote had been
accurate and biden got the most votes
would you accept him as your president
i'll bet
they'd all say yes is that an
insurrection
we want the person who got the most
votes to be president
is that an insurrection no that's the
opposite
it's literally the opposite and it's
obvious i don't have to spin anything
to say it's the opposite of that it's
it's obvious
kyle who thinks i'm being disingenuous
with my spin
you have been hypnotized now when i say
you've been hypnotized
i mean that literally you're actually
seeing something that isn't there
you're literally hallucinating i don't
mean
in the uh i'm not talking in some like
artistic way
you're actually having a literal
physical
mental hallucination because you think
there was an insurrection
you can't find any of it it's not on
video
there are no people who would say that
they were there for that purpose
they did not bring tools that could have
done it they didn't do anything that
could have caused
a change of government they controlled
the room for an hour
that's it now i've heard people say but
what if they'd gotten all the way to
pence
and pelosi what if they'd actually you
know got to them
to which i say what do you think they
would have done
now if some bad people were in there
they could have done illegal bad things
and nobody wants that
but even if they'd captured pelosi and
pence was the rest of the country going
to surrender
what would make that a coup it would
make it a crime
they should be punishable by the maximum
force
but how do you control the whole country
by taking one person or two people
hostage
that's not a thing it's not even
slightly a thing
and how would you keep them and hold
them hostage
with your twist ties and your viking hat
now i'm sure some people were armed but
did anybody bring out a gun
obviously they didn't intend to use
weapons because they had them
they didn't use them and they had every
reason to want to use them if if it had
been an insurrection
if it had been an insurrection they
would have used weapons
you mean actual guns weapons but they
use clubs
you can see a riot getting out of
control and those people need to pay for
pay further their crimes but
we should not treat this like it's a
serious
matter of an insurrection no
insurrection happened
no coup attempt happened none we should
treat the people who are having this
hallucination as
people who are having a medical mental
problem
you should laugh at it you should
you should mock the people who believe
that
the president should be held accountable
for an insurrection
now he should be held accountable he
should
for his actions in other words the
president's
lack of action to stop it i think is
fully worthy of criticism i wouldn't
push back at all
on that so um
we should stop treating this like
there's any doubt
about whether there was an insurrection
there's no doubt
nothing like that happened you can't see
it can't find it
can't taste it can't smell it can't find
any evidence of it
so the people who believed that
well we have lots of examples of people
on both sides of the political divide
believing things that are just crazy
just absolutely crazy
and we know that people can hallucinate
and believe
pretty much anything just anything
people believe that the president of the
united states
once stood in public and called
neo-nazis fine people
people think that actually happened it
didn't
he said the opposite if you watch the
whole video
so the the right play for this is to
treat it like
uh the people who are having this are
having a bad mental problem
that they're imagining something and
they think that the president
should be punished for what they're
hallucinating to be true
so that was for you kyle you were
hallucinating
and if you're wondering how can you tell
if you're hallucinating
uh one way would be to look for evidence
of that thing that you think happened
see if you can find any you won't
you won't you won't find anything that
looks like an insurrection
nothing and you can look as hard as you
are there won't be anything there
there will only be people telling you
they see it
if enough people tell you they can see
it it makes you see it
but that's what's happening it's not
there there's nothing there
somebody say the cop's funeral what
about it
uh did he just get blocked no i didn't
block him for that
all right then let's talk about
uh trump's trump's lawyers
so bruce castor was the first lawyer
i've never seen lawyers do a worse job
of you
if you watched trump's first lawyer
bruce castor
that was the worst job i've ever seen of
lawyering in my whole life
it's not like i've seen a lot of
lawyering but i've never said i've never
seen a worse lawyer
the whole time i was watching him
i was wondering i was imagining what
trump was doing because he knew he was
watching right
i was imagining trump at home watching
this on tv
it's like okay here he goes all right
it's not uh
he's wandering a little bit not getting
to the point all right he's going to get
to the point now
bring it home all right he's telling a
personal story
doesn't seem terribly relevant but this
won't last long all right now get to the
point
defend might okay it seems like he's
rambling again
but i know he's not gonna keep rambling
pretty soon he's gonna get to the
defense
and then then okay he's still rambling
he's still he's not talking about
anything that seems even related to the
case
i i i'm starting to drift off
can you imagine how mad
trump was when he watched that imagine
that your life is on the line
and this this guy goes all
[Laughter]
it was so bad it was actually just funny
but i hope hope it doesn't change things
in a bad way for
the president now his second lawyer i
guess did a better job
making the constitutional case but there
was no point even being there really
because it wasn't as if there was
anybody who was going to change their
mind
i guess one senator changed size or
something but it wasn't going to matter
it's a political process
so arguing the the law
during a political process it's just a
waste of time so the senate decided
to vote that they do have jurisdiction
is that how it works can the senate
simply
take jurisdiction for something the
constitution does not give them
jurisdiction over
can they just vote that they have it
well that's what they did
how do you vote yourself jurisdiction
it seems like jurisdiction has to come
from a higher
a higher source doesn't it like how can
you give yourself power
ah there's something wrong with that
right i can see how
a higher authority could give you power
but how do you give yourself power
and jurisdiction specifically so
that was sketchy but again it doesn't
matter you know i could argue
how it's illegal or non-constitutional
or anything none of that matters
once you say it's a political process
then you don't need
to be legal you don't need to be
constitutional
you don't need to make sense you don't
need to use the facts
you don't need to argue with reason you
don't need to do anything
as soon as you agree it's a political
process
everything else is and yet
they they have to present it like it's
not it's like oh
maybe it's sort of like a legal process
do you believe it no hey maybe we'll
change people's minds with our clever
arguments
no no that's not happening so there's
nothing
it's complete theater that has nothing
to do with how anybody will vote or what
will happen to the country or anything
and they're running this theater
instead of doing their work but
yesterday even fox news
was reporting that work continues on the
on the stimulus do you think it is
do you think that that congress has no
impact on their other business to take
two weeks out and just work on this
because
if this doesn't affect their other
business
then maybe we should cut their pay
because if they can take two weeks out
and it doesn't affect anything else
they're doing what the hell else were
they doing
because if i take two weeks out of my
job it's going to make a big difference
in my deadlines and the work backing up
if you take two weeks off of your job
and you don't have somebody filling in
for you
isn't that a big problem don't you have
a lot of work backed up when you come
back to work
but congress doesn't have that problem
they can just take two weeks out
and it won't affect the other stuff
they're doing come on
come on they're doing theater instead of
their job
right in front of you and they're not
even really pretending that they're not
doing that
any any observer can see that it's pure
theater
and it's obvious it's affecting their
other work and we're okay with that
we're like oh okay
it's entertaining oh let's watch it
i enjoy it though
[Music]
hello do you hear that the world
crickets thanks to the financial
stimulus
your credit card companies visa
mastercard
discover and american express have
finally agreed to lower the interest
rates
as well as your monthly payment have you
noticed that your spam phone calls
all sound like uh evening crickets for
the first five seconds
you answer the phone and you hear just
like silence and crickets
like actually crickets do you wait
for the crickets to be done because you
know it's going to be spam right
if it's a real person they say hi right
away
anyway
so let's see what else we've got going
on uh
here's a the simulation winking at us
the
the head of the uh afl-cio union
his name is richard trumka
t-r-u-m
trumka it sounds like trump and ivanka
put together trumpka
a weird coincidence i guess
and he sided with uh biden as biden was
reducing jobs in his union
what that's right his job
is to make more you know the the union
head's job is to make sure that his
union
is taken care of and that you know they
get jobs and benefits and stuff
and he sided with biden in reducing the
number of jobs in his union
and people have wondered huh
what does it mean to be the head of a
union
if you're not fighting for jobs for the
union but you're fighting for the person
who's
fighting against that
now here was his uh his statement when
it was pointed out to him in an
interview
on axios i guess axios uh
here was the way he uh presented it
he said quote richard trumka did i wish
talking about uh biden and his uh
xl pipeline decision to cancel that
project
he said i wish he hadn't done that on
the first day because the laborers
international union is right trump
told axios it did and will cost us jobs
in the process
here here's the fun part
watch how he spins this he goes i wish
he had paired that more carefully
with the thing he did second by saying
here's where we're creating jobs
so the head of the afl-cio who knows
that he just got stabbed in the back
for supporting biden and then biden cuts
a bunch of union jobs
uh he's still defending the guy
and the way he's doing is saying gosh i
wish he'd been more careful
in pairing these new jobs with the ones
that are being lost you know because
if he'd paired them better we'd be fine
it doesn't really work that way does it
it's not like those same jobs you could
just take these
steel workers or pipe fitters or
whatever the hell they are and just
put them in there it's like ah you're
fine now you might have to relocate
that's kind of a big deal well you're
gonna have to move away from your
whole family if you want a new job
so watching him do that was funny but
why is it that biden can
bitch-slap the the afl-cio
and make them thank him for it not only
does he abuse them but he makes them
be nice to him anyway uh why can't he do
that to the teachers unions
who are preventing kids from going back
to school so he can throw this
union under the bus but he can't throw
the teachers unions under the bus
now part of the problem is that there
are more of them you know the the
teachers unions are local
so there may be just too many of them to
to find anybody to bribe
now i'm not going to suggest that i do
not suggest
that the head of the afl-cio has been
bribed in some way
but others are others are alleging that
he must have been paid off or he has
some some benefit there
because they don't quite understand why
he's doing the opposite of his job
which is to protect protect jobs in the
union
so i have no reason to believe that he
was paid off
but i do ask this question would that
work
would that work because if it works to
bribe
union leaders why aren't we doing that
can't we just bribe the teachers unions
are there too many of them
maybe if you get the big ones now i know
it's
probably or is it is it illegal
would that even be illegal can you bribe
a teacher's union
you can't bribe an elected politician
and it would be illegal to bribe a
foreign company
right so you can't you can't pay bribes
overseas that would be illegal in the
united states
to pay a bribe overseas but could you
bribe
a teacher's union representative
could you do that i mean could you
legally just say look
you know you're ruining the whole
country
i'll tell you what we'll we'll throw a
couple of bitcoin your way
you know one bitcoin for your vote
that's it we've got some billionaires
they want the schools open the
billionaires will pay it
so we'll just we'll just pay you to
change your mind
would that be illegal suppose you did it
overtly could you do it publicly and say
look
all you teachers unions we will
we'll give you directly some money you
just
vote our way
somebody says you're not very good at
hypnosis dude
well ronald did you think i was
hypnotizing you right now
is that why you were hallucinating was i
hypnotizing you and it wasn't working
let me tell you something about hypnosis
ronald if i were hypnotizing you
you wouldn't know it
i'll just leave you with that
um here's another issue the
apparently the stimulus package is going
to wrap into it also
a 15 an hour of minimum wage
which on fox news the headline says it
will cost 1.4 million jobs
so if you're reading fox news you read
the headlines
you'd say that's pretty bad the minimum
wage will go up i suppose that's good
for the people who get the wage
but it's going to cost 1.4 million jobs
so
so it's a bad idea right that's what the
headline says
but then you read the story it was the
cbo who said it would cost those jobs
and the cbo also says it would lift
roughly 900
000 americans out of poverty if that's
not in the headline
you are being fed propaganda right so
fox news is
giving you propaganda that 15 an hour
minimum wage will cut 1.4 million jobs
completely true
true that it was estimated not true that
it will happen but true that it was
estimated by the cbo
but you got to kind of put in that the
benefit
right if you show the cost and then you
put the benefit
like way down in the story that's
propaganda
that is not the news so if you think
that cnn is giving you the propaganda
and fox news is giving it to you
straight
that's not happening here's a good
example if they were giving it to you
straight they would have told you both
things
at the same time reduces 1.4 million
jobs
lifts nearly a million people out of
poverty
that would be the cost and the benefits
so do you believe the cbo that it will
cost 1.4 million jobs
1.4 million do you believe it
you shouldn't do you think that they can
actually estimate that
they can't that's not really something
that you can estimate
you know down to some kind of precision
so if you have
nearly a million people who will be
lifted out of poverty
and you have maybe and it's a big maybe
another 1.4 million who might
lose their job what would happen to the
1.4 million who lose their job
would they never get another job well if
the economy is growing
i would expect all of those people to
get better jobs just different jobs
and those different jobs would pay them
fifteen dollars an hour
so when you see that they would it would
cost 1.4 million jobs
do you think that's forever is it
forever
and if it's not forever shouldn't that
be in the story
because if it costs you 1.4 million jobs
for
only one month and then those people go
get different jobs at higher minimum
wage
is that really is so bad here's my
bottom line if you believe that
economists
can model this accurately enough
to know which of these two things is
better the people lifted out of poverty
uh versus the you know the loss of jobs
and some of those companies probably
closing
which which is the better thing you
don't know
do you think economists can actually
model that no
no they can't it's their job to do it so
they will they'll produce a report
because it's their job
they've been asked to make an estimate i
did economic estimates for a living
you can't estimate this nobody can it
doesn't matter how good you
are it doesn't matter how smart you are
it doesn't matter how good your models
are
it can't be done but these estimates are
useful for giving you sort of a an idea
what the range of possibilities is
and what they've told us is that the
range of possibilities is in this
million people affected kind of level
and of 370 million people in the country
right
if if i put it to you in that context
and i said
15 minimum wage
something like a million and of 370
million will be affected but only
temporarily
and then later they'll just get higher
pay because they'll eventually get a job
now of course how this works depends
entirely on the
the um the the employment situation
so as long as it's still easy enough
to get a job everything's fine if it's
hard to get a job
and you lose your job that was less than
fifteen dollars an hour
well you're in big trouble because you
can't get another job
but if there are plenty of other jobs
and you lose your job
that's less than minimum wage you came
out ahead
because you lost your 10 an hour job and
a month later you got a 50 an hour a
dollar
an hour job you came out ahead
the company didn't you know whoever was
paying you is making less money
but the point is all of the ins and outs
of this and then you have to factor in
the people who have more money are
spending more
that stimulates the economy in ways that
we just can't model
it's way too complicated because the
iterative nature
of what happens with these people who
get the higher wage then they buy some
stuff and then those people buy some
stuff
and it's like this whole iterative thing
that you can't possibly model
it is not modelable but i would agree
that the total damage is probably in the
million people-ish
size that's the only thing you can take
out of this
so somebody says why not 60 an hour
because that would be
 stupid there are some things
that don't really require an answer
somebody says it's a bad idea let the
market determine the wage
but the market doesn't if the market
could
determine the wage that would be great
but we do know that the
the market is not a perfect market
in other words there are lots of people
let me let me uh
let me say something that'll probably
get me in trouble but if i say it right
maybe not
the people who are working for minimum
wage are some combination of
young people who will someday make more
and older people who maybe don't have
the skills that they could ever make
more than that if you don't have the
skills to make more than minimum wage
are you really mobile can you just leave
your job and go to another one
well legally you can there's nothing
stopping you legally
from quitting your job and going to a
new one but i would argue
that that the adults who are kind of
stuck in that minimum wage
world i don't know that they're so
mobile
i don't know that they really have that
choice because it might mean
you know missing a paycheck and not
eating this week or something
so i don't know that they have the
wherewithal the ability
to change jobs as easily as you would
like
so i i'm questioning whether the free
market
is free in this case now remember the
free market is a great idea
until you get some some problems such as
a monopoly
would you agree that monopolies need to
be dealt with
or would you say well it's a free market
if the free market created a monopoly
then the monopoly is fine
just the way it is because you would
have to have both views i think
if if you believe that the free market
will adjust
um to minimum wage you know
if you believe that the free market will
give you the right wage level
then you probably also should believe
that monopolies are fine
because i don't think you can take a
view that sometimes you can tinker with
the free market
and sometimes not you either have to say
we're going to tinker with it or we're
not
and if you're not you've got to let
everything in and if you are
this is probably worthy of tinkering
probably worthy
it is one of the reasons that i got out
of the restaurant business by the way
although restaurants will probably have
a different minimum wage they usually do
um let's see i saw a fake news
story somebody asked me what i thought
of it and the
it looks obvious fake news but i'll tell
you what it is
that uh dr fauci was allegedly and i
think this is not even slightly true
was saying that hydroxychloroquine was
like a cure for sores coronas back in
2005. now why do i say that this is fake
news
number one if it were true
it would be headline news at least on
fox news
it'd be headline news somewhere in a big
news organization but it isn't
number two it comes from a unknown
source
so that's sketchy and number three it is
two
on the nose right it's a little
too exactly like a conspiracy theory
that that fauci would have publicly
said the hydroxychloroquine is a cure
back in 2005.
so if you put those three things
together i would say there's really no
chance that this is real
i think it's just it's pure fake news
like pure fake news not even based on
anything that ever happened
so i think you should treat that as pure
fake news
uh the world health organization
got a scientist to look into whether the
wu-gon lab was the source or what was
the source of the coronavirus
and this is a big surprise a guy who had
close connections to the wuhan lab
and also had been helping to fund them
for years you know getting them funding
he says that there's no evidence that
the lab was
to blame maybe it came from packaged
meat
that was shipped into the country now
uh one of the things that this world
health organization
guy did and i know what you're thinking
china influences them so you can't trust
the world health organization
and i agree but he
he uh attacked the u.s intelligence
agencies saying that they were wrong on
many aspects about covet
and then a lot of americans said what
what
how can you you chinese puppet
how can you say that the u.s
intelligence agencies are not dependable
well do you trust the u.s
intelligence agencies because you
shouldn't
they got wrong on the weapons of mass
destruction
they've been wrong on everything north
korea they were wrong
on russia collusion
have they been right about anything i
don't know
are they ever right so when i hear this
guy
uh you know chinese puppet allegedly
criticizing u.s intelligence i say well
you got that one thing right
i mean if you believe our own
intelligence services you're just a
sucker
because they are not meant to be
believed
they are professional liars it's what
they do
so if you believe them why would you
believe a professional liar
why it would be like taking uh trump at
face value for what he said his crowd
size was
why would you ever do that it wouldn't
make any sense
so my bottom line is i do not believe
it is certain that the wuhan lab was
involved
in creating creating some kind of a leak
i would agree with the world health
organization that if the only source we
have that says it did come from the
wuhan lab
is u.s intelligence agencies you don't
have anything
there is no credibility whatsoever
to u.s intelligence agencies on on a
question like this
now there may be places where they would
be credible but certainly not on this
so you should not believe necessarily
that it came from the wuhan
lab i do think that point is well made
that we don't know where it came from
but that's
just the end of the story we just don't
know where it came from
that's it that might be the end of the
story
um here's the weirdest thing
well you be the judge have you seen the
pictures of tom brady
shirtless after his super bowl win
i guess he was frolicking recently in
some beach
and there are pictures of him shirtless
now one of the things that people say is
my god he looks the same as when he was
20
i mean he looks like he hasn't aged but
i've never seen anybody who looked less
like an athlete
with their shirt off to the point where
if you couldn't tell you know that he's
taller than i am
if you saw me with my shirt off and
let's say just a torso shot
and then you saw just the torso shot of
tom brady
i'm 20 years older than he is and i
would look a lot more like an athlete
with my shirt off
like not even close he doesn't look like
he's ever exercised
he doesn't look like he's ever exercised
it's the weirdest thing
and i wonder if that's part of his
secret because
if you've ever watched tennis you know
roger federer
is somewhat famous for being
not really trained in the the usual way
he doesn't have much muscle definition
except his one
tennis arm so it's
it's weird when you see people who don't
have obvious muscle
structure who can do things that are
very muscular
so he says show us evidence well
i mean can tom brady do that
i don't know can he it didn't look like
he could
it looked like his arm was a little
noodle
and i'm not saying that i'm i'm not
arnold schwarzenegger i'm just saying
that legitimately if you could only see
my torso you would think i was the
athlete and you would think he wasn't
and i don't know i don't know
like how he can do the things he does
with his spindly little
body but he makes it work
i'm a fan by the way so i'm not i'm not
trying to criticize
tom brady i think you know i'm a big fan
of everything he's done
so that can i throw a football no
no i can throw a football you know
the length of my living room probably
uh being vegan will do that to you maybe
that's it maybe he's not getting enough
protein
um
you order scott calendar yeah he is six
foot four so he's got that going for him
yeah if you saw him standing if you saw
me standing next to him
like full body you wouldn't have any
doubt who the athlete was
i'm just saying it's weird that he
doesn't have muscle definition
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you later
all right periscope is gone youtube
you're still here
um you are kind to cats i am kind to
cats i don't know why you said that but
i am kind to cats
hello realtor uh
all right i'm just looking at your
comments but they seem to be kind of
random
how's snickers she's doing great
uh
all right your comments are funny but
i'm gonna go do something else and i
will talk to you tomorrow
