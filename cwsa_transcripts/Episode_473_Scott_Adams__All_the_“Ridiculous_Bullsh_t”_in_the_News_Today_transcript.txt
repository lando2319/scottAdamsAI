hey everybody come on in here NPC
otter that's kind of a funny name Ryan
good to see you gather around there's
still a chair left couple of the couple
of seats up front everybody come on in
make sure you have your
beverage okay I see somebody has their
chalice
ready and it's time for a little thing
we call the simultaneous
zip and if you're prepared you already
have a glass mug possibly a thermos as
tanker Stein a chalice you filled it
with your favorite liquid and you're
ready now to join me for the
simultaneous
sip
ah so let's look at the news
um here's a uh mental experiment for you
I'm not suggesting this happen I'm just
saying if it did happen imagine this
imagine if somebody wanted to create a
hoax in which they were making the case
that Adam Schiff is an agent of
Russia how hard would it
be now I'm not saying that shiff is an
agent of Russia I'm not making that
claim I'm saying how what would that
look
like so the first thing you'd ask is has
he ever had any conversations with any
Russians who are associated with
Putin and you already know the answer to
that all of the senior politicians in
Washington have had multiple contacts
with high- ranking
Russians check contact with high ranking
Russians associated with Putin
check next if you looked could you find
some suspicious advertisements or
anything connected with
Russia in regards to Adam schiff's last
election well bet nobody's looked has
anybody looked if you did
look would you find that any troll s
from Russia had made any
ads and how many ads would it
take cuz remember the entire Russian
troll Farm operation here's something
that they don't say when they report the
news they say Russia interfered with the
election
true Russia had a troll farm that sent
out a bunch of ads that were negative
for um Hillary
Clinton true and then they sto there you
know what else is also
true the ads were so poorly made that
they look like a high school effort
anybody who understands anything about
influence would tell you they're
completely
inert the other thing they don't tell
you is there weren't that many of them
really compared to all of the other
messages going on about the
election and
the uh the last thing they don't tell
you is that there were also ads uh
against
Trump so how exactly do you explain the
fact that the Russian troll Farm made
memes that were
anti-trump well then you say well okay
Russia was trying to not get Trump
elected he was trying to just sew
Discord to which I say those are
different those are different things
sewing Discord actually you know makes
some sense I suppose and that would that
would explain why there are ads on both
sides Clinton ads and and Trump ads but
does does what I just described which I
believe passes all the
factchecking um have you ever seen any
expert say I've looked at the Russia ads
and these would work you've never seen
that
because there's no expert who would ever
say that nobody ever says the Russians
tried to interfere but when we looked at
the nature of their interference just
talking about the troll Farm here it was
so
amateurish and for whatever reason it
was attacking both sides that I'm not
sure we can conclude anything from
it that would be close to the truth so
anyway if you were if you were trying to
frame Adam Schiff or any
major um politician in the United States
couldn't you find lots of contacts they
had with
Russians and then you would look for
other information such
as you would try to find
out if
uh if they had ever tried to influence
anything for you or or you'd ever tried
to do anything for them so could you
find anything that Adam Schiff ever did
that you could Define as positive for
Russia do you think you could look at
Adam shi's record and find anything that
looks like it's sort of soft on Russia
or good for
Russia well how about the most obvious
thing the most obvious thing if it's
true as our intelligence agencies have
said that the thing that um that Russia
likes more than anything is to sew
Discord
who is Swing more Discord in the United
States than Adam schf is there anybody
who's sewing more Discord than Adam
Chef no Adam Chef has been involved in a
plot to dismantle the United States for
the last two
years compare that to anything Trump is
accused
of right let's let's compare these two
things Adam Schiff spent two years
destabilizing the United States a
nuclear power and got really close to
succeeding that's what Adam Schiff did
for
Russia here's what the Trump campaign
did Don Jr went to a
meeting I'll say it again in case the in
case there's any you know Nuance left
Adam schf has spent two years almost
successfully
dismantling the stability of the United
States a nuclear power that's what Adam
shiff did and nobody de nobody's
questioning that statement that's
exactly what he did the Trump campaign
there was a time they went to a meeting
and nothing
happened those are not equivalent
they're not even close so if the
evidence of collusion is a combination
of how many Russian contacts you've
had Plus what you've done that Russia
would like done there's no it's not even
close all bet Adam Schiff has way more
Russian contacts through his whole
career probably way more
contacts than Trump or Trump's campaign
it so wouldn't it be true he'd have way
more Russian contacts I mean I don't
know if it's true but don't we think
it's true because I would think it would
be true of any professional politician
at that level they probably all met a
lot of Russians
and all the Russians seem to be
connected to to
Putin and certainly it's true that what
he's done is way better for Putin than
anything that the Trump campaign did not
even close I they're not even in the
same ballpark
anyway I say this not because I think
Adam Schiff is uh guilty of anything
with Russia I say it so you can better
understand how it could look exactly
like anybody was guilty of colluding
with Russia you could kind of randomly
pick anybody and make the same case if
you look hard
enough now um and of course people
arguing against this would say well
that's different because Don Jr just to
pick one example he
intended we know that he intended to get
information at that meeting with the
Russian
lawyer to which I say it's still the
United States States and it's still
legal to walk into a different room in
your own building which he did that's
where the meeting was was in Trump
Tower you it's still legal to walk into
a room in your own building you know the
company's building in this case and
listen to something that somebody
says that's never
illegal that is never illegal speaking
of which I'm going to brag about a
prediction now I may have said this only
once so I'm going to need some um some
witnesses who saw me or heard me say
it was there a point when talking about
obstruction of justice and the charges
against the president do you remember me
saying that there's no way that he could
get convicted and here was my
reasoning my reasoning was that
professional lawyers people who really
went to law school and know what they're
doing and have done this for years
looked at the case and looked at the
evidence and said I don't know some say
that looks like obstruction but other
qualified lawyers look at exactly the
same information nobody's questioning
the facts and said that's not doesn't
look like it to me now what did I tell
you is always going to be true if high
level lawyers can't even decide if it's
illegal or
not it's one thing to to differ about
the facts but the weird thing about this
case is that both sides were looking at
the same facts and were satisfied that
they had the facts nobody was guessing
or or speculating about information that
was yet to come we felt we all had the
same information so in the situation
where professional qualified experienced
lawyers some say it looks like a problem
and some say it doesn't look like a
problem which way will that always go if
you have lawyers as good as the
President of the United States it will
always go to not
guilty it can't go any other way because
you don't live in a country where half
of the legal profession can look at a
case and say you know I can't even
really tell I mean I'm looking at the
law I'm looking at the facts and man I'm
a professional and I just can't even
tell if that's even a crime
there's no way anybody in that kind of
situation goes to jail no way our legal
system has its
flaws it has its flaws but that's never
going to happen I don't think you'll see
that now when I say it's never going to
happen certainly it could happen to a
poor person who doesn't have good
representation but if you have you know
if your lawyer is the Supreme Court I'm
exaggerating a little bit right not not
technically but given that the the
president has made appointments to the
Supreme Court and that their
conservative leading I will say in a Hy
hyperbolic
way the president's lawyer is the
Supreme
Court and they probably like him more
than they dislike him now he also has
some of the best lawyers in the world or
at least access to the best legal Minds
in the world so the odds of that
actually being a um a legal risk to the
president it's always scary of course
but there was no real chance that he
could get in trouble for that in the
end now with that
context what do you think about
Mueller's decision to punt the
obstruction call to
Bar think about it with the
understanding that the best lawyers in
the world can't even tell if it's
against the law did you want meller to
make the
decision think about it you didn't want
meller to make that decision in the end
because all right people are saying that
it was it was cowardly and
chicken I'm not entirely sure because
what we know here's what we know about
Muller okay very experienced certainly
understands the law and very smart
and as far as we can tell as far as we
can tell
honorable as far as we can tell a
patriot right I don't have any counter
information to that everybody says the
same
thing if all of those things are true
and you you you assume capability and
good intentions so I assume both of
those things about Muller High
capability especially with his staff Etc
and good intentions meaning he wanted to
have the fairest result by kicking over
to Bar he sent a very clear message and
the clear message is that the law itself
is not
clear that's the message so the message
that Mueller sent to bar and indirectly
to the rest of the country is that a
professional lawyer and the in fact some
of the top lawyers in the entire country
can't even tell if this is against the
law
that was actually a cleaner message than
if he had just said we didn't find
evidence that the law had been
broken I actually prefer the way Muller
did it because Bar's decision is
no-brainer bar is the boss when you've
got a situation where it's so ambiguous
your very best thing to do is to kick it
up to the boss and if that boss could
kick it up again
that boss should right if bar had a boss
whose job it was to make legal decisions
above bar what should bar have done
should have kicked it up right but there
was nobody for bar to kick it up to he
was the top legal person and then the
next one was the president and that
doesn't
count so Mueller's decision to take an
ambiguous situation that even lawyers
can't tell if it's against the law and
Ki it up to his boss a
100% exactly what I would have wished
him to do you know had I looked at the
situation and understood it that
way enough on that
um so you saw the president
um override Betsy DeVos on the Special
Olympics um so the story is Betsy DeVos
was going to cut I don't know 18% of the
budget for Special Olympics which was
just the government part her argument
was that the Private Industry would take
care of the rest of it um I didn't
realize how many people were involved in
Special Olympics there are 272,000
kids involved in Special Olympics I had
no idea if you would asked me I would
have
said 5,000 that would have been my guess
5,000 um oh it's was it 18 million it
was or was it 18% I'm looking at your
comments anyway but the point is it
doesn't matter at this point the
president in a uh when he was caught
going to the helicopter and the Press
was asking questions he said that he's
decided to override his people and to
reinstate the
funding now here's the great thing about
that I was laughing when when I saw it
now I didn't expect it but he made
exactly the right play so first of all
um Betsy DeVos has also uh issued a
statement saying that she too wished
Special Olympics could always be funded
and it always felt that way but she was
just trying to do her job basically with
the budget so it's a little awkward for
her but she's she's handling
it
and here's what I love about it from the
president's point of view the story
started out this way the story started
out as Trump is a Monster who doesn't
like kids who would be in the Special
Olympics so that was the headline he
walked into in the
morning but sensing an opportunity that
his own staff was really the ones who
were making those decisions he publicly
overrode the decision and said no I I
disagreed so I completely changed that
so it completely changes the
story to Trump is a champion of Special
[Laughter]
Olympics he took a headline which was
Trump hates the Special Olympics to
Trump is the savior of the Special
Olympics now not exactly and of course
the Democrats will just say ah you just
screwed up should have been one decision
the whole time but in terms of what the
public saw on camera because we're we're
far more influenced by you know a an
anecdote to then a concept the concept
was something in the Trump
Administration was going to cut the
Special Olympics but it didn't happen
it's sort of a weak concept the stronger
part is the visual of trump overriding
his own staff to fund the Special
Olympics like that's the part you're
going to
remember so politically he took a total
losing hand and just said well let's see
what happens if I do this oh that worked
so that was cool and it's not a big
enough story that it lasts forever so he
he got a win out of a
loss if you saw his
speech uh last night what was the best
Applause
line there there was there were two
words he
used that if you have children in the
room cover their ears cover their ears
put in your
headphones naughty word is coming
so Trump in front of this rally crowd um
I would say that Trump looked more
relaxed and in the pocket you know in
terms of his job he was in the pocket
and it was really fun to watch I only
watched the first part then I had other
stuff to do but he he refers to the uh
he refers to the whole Russia collusion
stuff as quote ridiculous
 now
this President can swear in public
better than any president has ever sworn
in public I'm sure he's pretty good at
it in private too but in public have you
ever seen anybody swear in public better
than this President see now the beauty
of
it the beauty of it is that that line is
it sort of taunts it taunts the
anti-trump press to report it
what do what do the citizens of the
United States think about Thea
occasional use of the word in a
context where it's totally the right
word all right he's not just throwing in
swear words because swear words are fun
he he's not this this is the part you
have to catch he does occasionally throw
in a naughty word so this it's not like
he's never done it but if you think
about it
he really he really uh he's careful
about when to use it he uses it to draw
attention to stuff and he uses it just
enough that it seems like something new
so it draws your attention to it whereas
if he did it a lot it would be too
much so his perfect use of an
inappropriate term and and putting the
word ridiculous in front of it is what
really sold it by the way if all he had
said
is the Russian collusion investigation
was
 that would have been weak it
just would have been a swear
word but he says in his perfect delivery
ridiculous it was the most
convincing public cursing I've ever seen
like it was it was authentic it was I I
know I'm making a big deal about
something that seems like a small deal
but it but it really was so well done
that I had to call it out
all
right sorry allergies this morning
um so uh you saw the news that there's a
prison reform effort uh put together by
Meek Mills and
Jay-Z and I guess it got funded to $50
million including Robert Craft he was
one of the funders so he probably needs
to fund a few things to stay on the side
of the Angels that's at the moment but
uh van Jones has been uh hired to head
it up so it's going to be a professional
organization dedicated to prison reform
I don't know exactly what they're going
to do but I like I like everything about
it and I like that van Jones is is the
leader that I think that could produce
some good
stuff so that's just a that's just a
congratulations
note um here's a question for you
how long has it been since president
Trump created a new
outrage think about it now I'm not
talking about an executive order for the
or the emergency order because that's
just politics I'm not talking about
talking about cancelling um
Obamacare because that's over reported
you know he's going to he wants to keep
existing conditions Etc
so I'm not talking about just the
politics how long has it been since
Trump just said something that people
went my God you can't say
that prior to midterms right prior to
midterms that's what I think too yeah
the goal on is just
politics I don't know that the McCain
comments qualify anymore when he when he
was originally talking about
McCain uh it seemed like he was banging
you know he was he was saying terrible
things about a war hero and then
later later it seemed like maybe
McCain's hands were a little bit dirty
because not only did he have a you know
down vote on Obamacare getting rid of it
but he uh you know he had some
involvement with getting that dossier to
the Press now that involvement seems to
be indirect or maybe not at all because
now we know that Lindsey Graham actually
advised McCain to give the dossier to
the uh to the FBI um and it was somebody
that was on McCain's staff who took it
to the Press so we don't know that
McCain necessarily was behind anything
going to the Press but he gave the
president an opening to um criticize
them and it doesn't seem to me that the
McCain criticisms
really caught the Public's
attention that was my impression
wouldn't you say it because it seemed
like just more of the same and you know
and McCain had it come in a little
bit um so anyway my point is that the
president said after the midterms that
maybe he would try to tone it down a
little bit and I would say that maybe he
has or maybe we just got used to him or
maybe it's something in between but but
he's gone a long time without creating a
brand new story of outrage am I wrong
about that fact check me on that but it
just seems like that hasn't happened
lately all right let's talk about
um let's talk
about um how to how to fix
everything let's say you wanted to fix
healthc care you wanted to fix prison um
the prison system prison reform let's
say you wanted to fix
education and let's say you wanted to
fix um the the budget let's say you
wanted to fix all those things at the
same time is there any and let's say you
wanted to do uh reparations slave
reparations slavery
reparations um and let's say you want to
do that in a way that did not make
anybody mad it sounds impossible right
how the world could you do slave
reparations slavery reparations in this
country without angering a huge amount
of people can't be done right well
challenge
accepted let me
suggest something that would solve a
whole host of problems by solving one
thing I just want to put that out there
suppose the president said we need at
least one highquality free
education program so we don't have to
change all colleges we just need to
create one guaranteed free path to
college for
everyone for
everyone so so here's my plan if the
only thing you fixed was the cost of a
good college education or let's say
training as well so it's not just
College it's any kind of Career Training
if you were to make that all free
could
you do a lot less with healthare yes CU
if you're training people better you
have gone a long way toward getting
people jobs and then they can afford
healthare or they work for a company
that pays for their Healthcare so if you
were to fix the college SLC Career
Training thing and make that free for
everyone you would make a huge impact
eventually on healthc care costs cuz
people would be working and when you're
working you can at least have a chance
of affording them um let's take slavery
reparations if you came up with any kind
of a plan that transferred money from
people who had nothing to do with
slavery to people who may or may not
have even been descended from slaves
nobody's going to approve well won't say
nobody but it won't it won't get public
approval enough of it so you can't have
anything that's like a direct transfer
of wealth from one ethnic group or many
ethnic groups to another that will never
fly in this country and
shouldn't but suppose you said as part
of slavery reparations we're going to
make it college free for
everyone for everyone it will have no no
impact on rich people because they were
going to go to college anyway but for
everybody of every
ethnicity it would be free
that I think you could consider a form
of reparations and I'm going to use uh
Hawk
nome's Insight that I think he borrowed
from somebody but I liked it somebody
says I'm turning off
now you haven't even heard the argument
why would you turn it off before you
hear the
argument I like the people who are so
close-minded I'm not going to wait till
the end where I hear all the argument I
I'll just I'll just just hear the first
part and I'm done don't you trust me
that by the end of this it's going to
sound better than it sounds now don't
you think I can sell this a little
better than I have yet you don't think
there's more coming come on first day on
Periscope um so here's the
thing if you fixed education in this
country you would take you would it
would go a long way toward fixing race
Rel ations it would go a long way to
fixing health care because more people
would be working it would go it would
eliminate um
future college debt because you wouldn't
need it if you didn't want it it would
uh reduce our debt national debt because
even though the college would cost a lot
the amount it would add to the economy
eventually would probably be far greater
there are a few things that are more
valuable than um putting somebody to
work let me say it this way if you could
if you had a choice between giving all
of you who already have jobs a 10% raise
or a few of you who don't have jobs go
from unemployed to employed which is
better it's way it's way better for the
total economy to take somebody from
unemployed where they cost money to
employed where they're creating value
that that's the big gap going from
unemployed to employed is an enormous
economic leap getting a raise is really
good but that's a smaller smaller impact
right so you could take care of prison
reform because people would have
education and more options so if you
fixed Healthcare I'm sorry if you fixed
only education made it free widely
available and covered trade um trade
stuff as well as regular College you
would settle you would solve
almost all of the other big problems in
the
country until the robots take over and
then none of us have jobs and then it's
then we're all
dead somebody said college is BS except
for stem I think that Insight is not
only correct but could be a key part to
making college free so the first thing
you should do to make college free is
acknowledge what the commenter said
which is the current form of college is
not only
expensive but it's
way poorly poorly designed if you look
at the classes that people have to take
to get some kind of a degree there's
always some garbage in there all right
you know you you could
design uh an accredited school maybe
it's a government accredit accreditation
for a a free path now that path might
include a lot of online training uh so
could look like anything all right
um apparently uh last night on Martha
mallum show a guest Marie harf was on
and said once again repeated the fine
people
hoax and I haven't seen the clip so if
anybody can tweet me the clip I'd like
to see it but apparently uh Martha melum
did
not um oh
somebody you're still on the um the
education thing so I didn't do a good
job of summarizing the point the point
looks like this there are some things
you can spend money on and you've just
lost your money but there are other
things you spend money on and you get it
back so it's not an investment per se
but it's a good use of money because you
put a little money here but you gain a
lot of money there education is is more
like that than almost anything else if
you if if the government just said all
right we're just going to have a bigger
deficit or raise your taxes or whatever
you're going to do but everybody's going
to get free college maybe it's online
maybe maybe you can't all go to Harvard
but there's some kind of free college
and training if you did that the idea is
that the benefit to the overall economy
would so be so enormous maybe in you
know 10 years but it would be so
enormous that the uh national debt would
go down overall because people would be
working Health Care would cost less
because people would have jobs they'd
have income so the idea is that $1 spent
on um fixing
education would create
$10 for the economy so that's the key
point if it's not true that investing $1
in
education gives you back $10 in the
economy then I'm not in favor of it so
that's that's the only thing you have to
ask yourself is it true that putting a
dollar into education so that everybody
that especially the lower income people
can get a real education or real job
training whatever that looks like is it
true that a dollar spent on that creates
$10 in economic benefit or something
that's a multiple of $1 so just check
that one point because if the one point
is true then all the rest of the
argument holds together and if it's not
true none of it holds together so just
fact check me on that one thing that's
it all right uh so I was saying Marth
melum had uh Marie harf a guest on and
she repeated the fine people hoax if
anybody has that clip send it to me
because once again somebody says wrong
if it is wrong then I I would certainly
reassess my opinion um so we've got to
keep staying on that fine people hoax
where I I tweeted out yesterday today
some of you saw it that if you do a uh
Google search on quote find people and
Charlottesville that's your search term
Google will kick up the debunking of the
hoax in the third spot so it's right on
it's near the top so I think the first
two links um talk about it like it
really happened but then the third link
fairly easy to notice calls it a hoax so
at least it's in the top page so I'd
like to get it to the top spot
so I'm going to keep hammering on it but
at least it's at the top
page um so thank and thanks to Steve
Cortez by the way because his article in
real clear politics is the link that
made it to the third spot so without
Steve Cortez his
article that that would not have
happened so good work from Steve on that
that really helps the country a lot in
my opinion the president made a claim
last night in the speech that this is
the first year that pharmaceutical
prices have not gone
up is that
true cons I I did not see any fact
checking on it so I I went to CNN page
to find out because you know it would be
a big headline president lied about
pharmaceutical costs and I didn't see it
maybe it's there or maybe it's coming
but can
somebody do a fact check on that
is it true that drug prices did not go
up in the past year is that true because
it doesn't feel
true but he said it in very clear
language and I did not see a fact
checked fat checked so somebody check on
that because that's that's
enormous that is enormous if it's true
and if it's not true i' I'd like to know
if there's anything that's truish in
that cat category that he was talking
about all right
uh let's talk
about oh speaking of uh
education um so last night my uh I've
told you that I'm taking drum lessons
online part of the reason I wanted to
take drum drum lessons online is to
experience online training in a in a
real situation where I really wanted to
learn something and that was the only
method I was using other than practice
so um my drum teacher is now on my
company's app the interface by whenhub
app and I wanted to point anybody to him
who wants to also take a drum lesson
because I can I can vouch that um it's
been very good for me and he's a good
teacher his name is Michael and if you
go to the interface by whenhub app where
you can contact an expert and pay them
for their time in real time by a video
call um I'll just put in
drum drum drum drum
drumming search for drums and then there
are a whole bunch of drum
teachers I'll just tell you which one
was
mine let's see if he's still on
there he may have he may have signed off
oh there he is Michael ansburg or
so if you wanted to use my drum teacher
just uh use the keyword drums and look
for Michael an it's
burger and um he said at $95 an hour
you'll see other drummers are cheaper I
would suggest that uh he might be worth
it compared to the the lower cost
drumming
people so um and you can also schedule
him so he's got his schedule on there so
can you can schedule them
um and I would hope that if you support
the app the interface by one Hub app um
it will go a long way toward making
making it easier to find information
about a whole host of things so this
past week we had an expert on the
interface by whenhub app who was
advising people on cancer clinical
trials now think about this let's say
you have cancer and you're you're going
to your cancer doctor and maybe you've
got a cancer
specialist and you say are there any
clinical trials I can get into for my my
type of cancer that doesn't respond to
regular treatments would your regular
doctor know about available cancer
clinical trials that you could get into
and the answer is
no because not every doctor is following
that field of all the the clinical
trials so our expert um was taking calls
uh last few days he's still on there you
can just search for cancer and
[Music]
um and uh he advises people how to find
clinical trials now imagine trying to
Google that yourself it's basically
ungoogleable at least in a comprehensive
way um yeah most people would not be
able to to know how to find the right so
and the other the other problem is that
the trials are really specific to types
of cancer so matching the your cancer
with a specific trial is no easy thing
but it can be done if an expert knows
the field so that's the sort of benefit
that the interface by whenhub app should
bring and I hope I hope uh you will
support it I will also tell you
just out of total fairness that the
value of the when token that's
integrated with the app so we've created
our own uh crypto not crypto but let's
say a blockchain token that you can use
to pay people within the app or cash so
you can just use regular cash if you
want but the value of the tokens um
could be going up it's not an investment
and you should not listen to cartoonists
telling you where to put your money you
should never do that but there's a lot
of activity and we're going to be doing
a major um series of marketing for the
for the app and in theory if the app is
successful the value of the tokens would
go way up and so this would be the time
if you thought it was going to be
successful this would be the time to um
own those
tokens um no guarantees not an
investment don't take Financial advice
from cartoonists but it is nonetheless
true that this would be the part of the
life cycle that if it were going to go
up you would have wished you had gotten
in there all right
um North Korea seems to be stumbling in
terms of our conversation with
them I would suggest and I don't know if
this is happened yet but and maybe I've
said this before
that the St block seems to be how do
they keep their nuclear
program while also getting rid of their
nuclear program so there's there's one
sticking point that people can't quite
figure out how to get past and I've got
a
suggestion and the suggestion would be
that the United States or South Korea um
propose that they transition the nuclear
expertise that they have for weapons
into domestic
um maybe a test bed for Generation 4
nuclear power now Generation 4 is the
stuff that doesn't melt down it's easier
so you don't have the risk that you have
with traditional old nuclear and if they
have a bunch of nuclear experts and this
part you'd have to fact check but I'm
assuming that if you had expertise in in
nuclear weaponry a lot of that should
cross over to domestic nuclear purposes
now one of the benefit of North Korea is
that it's already a terrible dangerous
place and the Kim family can make any
regulations they want about anything so
in theory you should be able to get a
nuclear power plant a generation 4 plant
uh up and running in North
Korea faster than you could do it
anywhere else simply because Kim can say
what do you need well we need a bunch of
land in in a certain kind of place you
know needs it needs some power and that
needs you know whatever it needs and Kim
could just say okay you got it uh and so
North Korea could become um a world
power in becoming experts in designing
and exporting safe small uh nuclear
power and so here's here's why this idea
is appealing Generation 4 nuclear power
is appealing by itself North Korea is a
unique place where they could U they
could speed through the regulations to
build them it's hard to do in the United
States because of all the regulations
next it gives a it gives an offramp for
Kim in which he comes on ahead with his
nuclear program now you might say to
yourself yes Scott but a nuclear weapons
program is for a completely different
purpose than domestic nuclear power
those are not the same thing and maybe
it's not directly you know directly
transferable just a little bit of
overlap with the expertise so it's not
really like the nuclear weapons can just
sort of evolve into peaceful nuclear
power but it doesn't need to it's the
story so what I'm talking about is not
not so much the Practical um variables
on the ground but rather the story if I
say to the public we have this we built
this nuclear capability for weapons we
no longer need these weapons because now
we're working well with China and the
United States and South Korea this would
be Kim story we don't need those weapons
but we don't want to give up our
national pride our Our National Asset so
we're going to transition this to become
the greatest domestic you know safe
nuclear power company in the world that
story is a story of
winning the story of we built nuclear
weapons and now we have to throw them
away cuz somebody big told us to is a
total loser story you can't give Kim an
offramp to doom and when then wonder why
he doesn't play ball don't give anybody
an offramp to doom and expect good
results you got to build an offramp to
something that works now the president
has quite cleverly and the first smart
person who even got into this
conversation in my opinion
has made a big deal about talking about
the economic potential of North Korea
and that's so he's already set the table
that where we'd like to see North Korea
Go is is richer and more successful and
I think that's
true to add that extra element of could
you become our testing ground where even
we benefit from what you do with nuclear
weapons you know chairman Kim can you
help us
do you feel
that feel the difference between
chairman Kim get rid of your nuclear
assets the gem of your entire nation the
greatest accomplishment of North Korea
why don't you throw them all away
because we're big and we'll punish you
if you don't that's that's the message
we have going now right compare that to
Chairman Kim we've got this huge problem
it's called climate change
or at least the experts say so and even
if you don't like the climate change
problem just you know we we need a lot
of energy to power the world in order to
power the world we need
energy we can't seem to figure it out
the whole rest of the world can't seem
to figure out how to build some
Generation 4 reactors I'm exaggerating
because they are being built in China
Etc but we need you we need North Korea
to get us to to Generation 4 in the most
effective way so can you help us with
your gigantic nuclear assets and the
fact that you have you know the ability
to cut through red tape in North Korea
can you help us get to this better place
where the whole world will benefit by
the Great accomplishments you've made in
North
Korea how's that how's that story
sound right there's no competition that
story is an offramp that the experts are
going to say and they would well you
can't just transition from nuclear
weapons to Generation 4 nuclear they're
practically you know they're 98%
different things it's just 2% maybe some
of the experts are easy to
transition doesn't matter it's about the
story and the story takes advantage of
the fact that the public doesn't know
anything about nuclear anything and to
the public if you said hey public
they're going to transition their
nuclear assets to Safe nuclear what
would the public say sounds great sounds
great because the public can't tell the
difference between nuclear weapons and
Generation 4 nuclear plants that's why
we don't have them if the public could
tell the difference between a safe
Generation 4 new nuclear design and a
nuclear bomb you know if if we knew the
difference we would already have
Generation 4 nuclear plants all over the
place all right
um let's uh open it up to
questions that's all I had
today open it up to
questions uh what's the most interesting
thing I said
today oh Chicago
yeah the smallest
story is
um I don't know it's a little played out
but apparently Jesse Smet has been
nominated for a a so-called image
award so he's been nominated for an
award for the good image that he's
creating uh I hope he wins because that
would be
hilarious somebody said why is AOC
persuasive but Betto is not Betto is
persuasive Betto is persuasive by
definition uh meaning that you have seen
him succeed and you have watched him
persuade people so I haven't watched his
technique so much um except I've talked
about uh his arm movements probably do
help him and the standing on the tables
and the standing on the cars probably
helps him but it also helps that he's
a um sort of an engage aging you know
white guy and women like him and and all
that so he is he is persuasive but he's
not AOC persuasive he's he's whatever's
the the rung just below her I would
say um you're going to get attacked for
your
reparations now that's interesting so
somebody says I'm going to get attacked
for my reparations now what I could I
just called reparations were free
college for everybody
everybody not not black people free
college for
everyone how's that going to get me in
trouble it should get me in trouble for
free college the fact that I said it's
essentially oh I forgot I I didn't I
didn't finish a point so I see why
there's an air gap there I wanted to
borrow I think I got interrupted I
wanted to borrow Hulk nome's um he had a
he had a good way of framing
something and I think he borrowed it
from some somebody but the idea was that
when you help
African-Americans you end up helping
everybody because if if in his view if
the African-American situation is the
most dire if you help that then you've
helped anybody who's in a similar
situation because everything's connected
and I'm doing a bad job of explaining
that but the idea is that uh you know if
you just help the poorest people who
have the Le options and get them trained
and get them employed that everyone wins
so you could call it
reparations but who would who would
object to reparations that
helped 90% of non-black people you know
90% of the benefit would go to
non-african-americans who who would
object to
that now you can object to it because it
it costs some money but then it's just a
budget question and it gets to is it a
$1 expense that makes $10 in economics
so you have to answer that
question
[Music]
um I'll get rid of whoever told me I'm
doing a bad job in all using all capital
letters somebody says it is not
reparations then okay so let me do a
better job because I see I'm I'm not
making my I'm not connecting my thoughts
well enough so your
criticisms uh I think are valid because
I'm I'm not doing a good job of
connecting the thoughts the thought is
this that we wouldn't embark on the on
the free college thing except that one
of its benefits is the same kind of
benefits of
reparations so it's a it's a replacement
for reparations so it would be not it
would not be fair to say that free
college is reparations it would be
fairer to say we have several problems
from economics to health care to you
know racial relations we're going to
solve all of them the same
way um and so if you say we're not this
this isn't
reparations it makes reparations
unnecessary and it's informed by
reparations another words it's listening
to what people are saying about
reparations it's coming up with a plan
that affects all ethnicities equally
because it's only the poor people that's
all
ethnicities and and it's it directly
addresses the problem because it creates
a a success path for everyone all right
that's my story I'm sticking to it and I
will talk to you later
