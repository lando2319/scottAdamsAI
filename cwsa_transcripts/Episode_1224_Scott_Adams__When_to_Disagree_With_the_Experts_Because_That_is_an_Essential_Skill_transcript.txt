you're right on time well at least some
of you are
the rest of you i call you laggards
laggards yeah it's time to up your game
and be here exactly at 7am
california time 10 a.m eastern time for
the best part of your day it's called
coffee with scott adams and the
simultaneous zip
it's amazing have you experienced it yet
well if it's your first day hold on to
your hat
it's that good oh it might sneak up on
you but it's that good
and all you need to enjoy it is
a copper bugger glass attacker jealous
or stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the moderna vaccine
go
well speaking of the modern uh vaccine i
guess that got
approved so we got a second vaccine
um and the interesting thing is
how do you decide which one to take
because i'm starting to hear reports of
you know the modern one might have
some advantages over the other one what
would you do
if your health care provider offered you
let's say the
the other one but you wanted the moderna
one
what would you do would you wait
if the only one you could get is the
other one because maybe you're in a
your hmo or something just as one of
them
i don't know it's going to be it's going
to be an interesting question
my advice to all of you will be the same
this is what i'm i'm going to do in
terms of my decision of
what vaccination to take or not
i'm going to wait till the last minute
and you should too
you don't need to make a decision until
somebody says
you can come in and get it until
somebody says
that you personally can go get a
vaccination
don't decide don't decide because there
might be extra information by then
so if you decide now before you have to
why would you do that wait until the
last minute you could be quite sure
you're going to take it or quite sure
you're not
but don't decide yet wait until the last
minute
that's the smartest place place to make
the decision
here's the most controversial story that
i have completely changed my opinion on
you saw the story about the ethicist
who i guess in new york times had his
article
and the ethicist claimed that it might
be
better for society if before
older people get to the vaccination
that the frontline health care workers
get taken care of
and part of his argument which made the
headlines
was that he thought that old people
shouldn't get the vaccination
first because they're mostly white
and that frontline healthcare workers
are more diverse
and so if you favored the front line
workers you would get a more
diverse and more fair distribution
and the way that was reported is a
racist
oh it's quite racist really really
racist
is it yes so
let me agree with the first part of the
criticism
unambiguously it's totally racist
it's unambiguously overtly
plainly transparently racist
but here's the part you're not gonna
like
you're ready but
no matter what you do it's racist
sorry sorry
no matter what you do it's racist
there isn't the non-racist option
if we had a non-racist option
i would say my god why are we even
obtaining this idea
from this clearly racist proposal
but that's not our situation it's not
and we can't get to a situation
where there would be any kind of a
non-racist uh
you know non-racist uh process
here's why no matter what rules you pick
no matter what group you say even if you
don't use race
if you just say well we'll do people
over a certain age
well mostly white right it wasn't your
intention
but it would just turn out that way so
things are racist
by outcome no matter what your intention
was
right so would you agree with the first
point
that the outcome has a racial
element to it even if nobody was
thinking in those terms
even if even if racism was nothing to do
with the decision
you'd all agree that there's always an
outcome that
favors one group or not no matter what
you do you can't avoid that
so let's talk about intention because if
the outcome is going to be racist no
matter what you can't get rid of the
racism part
so why would you worry about the thing
you can't change right that just can't
be changed
but you can question motive
that's always fair you can question
intention
if i thought that someone uh had
suggested in public
that white people should not get the
violent not get the vaccination
you know in an early way even if they're
old
um you know what's your first impression
of that
sounds pretty bad right but let me ask
you this
so suppose somebody came to me all right
let's personalize this take it out of
the the realm of public policy
take it down to you personally somebody
comes to you and they say
uh scott you're over 60.
you know i'm 63
and i'm in a you know i've got a little
asthma
so i've got some comorbidities i'm not
old old but i'm you know the beginning
of the
the older category and suppose they said
to me um
i'd like you to make the decision scott
it's up to you
we know that uh let's say older
black people have much worse outcomes
would you mind socially distancing a
little bit longer
and we're going to focus on black
citizens
not because they're black but because we
know they have worse outcomes
so if you're looking at the greater good
you want to give the
vaccination to whoever gets the best
outcome right
it just happens that they're black
that's not anybody's choice
it's nobody's intention it's just a
biological reality
so if somebody said to me scott
would you personally and you're not
making a decision for anybody else
right it's just you personally it's not
a public policy
it doesn't apply to anybody else it's
just you would you personally
socially distance a little bit longer
and take a little more risk
for the benefit of black citizens in the
united states
who are at greater risk what would i say
i'd say yes i'd say yes if somebody
asked me that question directly and said
look
it's up to you i'm we're not there's no
penalty
you will not be punished you won't be
punished
it's just up to you it's your own
conscience your own risks
your own risk reward calculation you can
be selfish if you want
it's up to you if you want to get it
first we'll put you right in the front
of the line and nobody will ever give
you a hard time for it
it's up to you i think i'd still wait
i think it's the weight because that's
actually a pretty fair
proposition if they can identify people
for whatever reason you know be they
black or have a comorbidity or be they a
certain age or
be they health care workers on the front
line if you can make a strong
case that this person is in a high risk
group
and i'm in a slightly less high-risk
group
yeah i'm okay with that absolutely
because you know it's a war right
it's a war and sometimes you've got to
be the one that does the dangerous stuff
so that somebody else doesn't have to do
it sometimes you've got to
you know brave the bullets to pull back
your wounded
comrade off the field right so we're in
a situation where
personal sacrifice should be a pretty
big part of the equation
if you're not thinking of it that way
then you're not in a
let's say a military mindset and maybe
we should be
we're we're in a war against a virus
maybe let's
let's act more like soldiers right so
somebody says white guilt am i suffering
from
white guilt because i would say the same
thing
no matter who the risk category was
so would you would you criticize me if i
said
i think people over 80 should get the uh
should get the vaccination before may
would you criticize me for that
if i said that frontline healthcare
workers should get it before me
would you would you criticize me for
that if i said that people who
what's the worst co-morbidity maybe it's
diabetes let's say diabetes is i don't
know if that's true but let's say it's
the worst one
if i said that everybody with diabetes
should get the shot before i do
would you criticize me for that why
would you criticize me
if i say no there's an obvious category
black citizens in this country clearly
have far worse outcomes why is that
different than diabetes
why is that different than being 80
years old
all right so there's your provocative
thought of the day i didn't think you'd
like it
but i feel it's worth mulling on
and i would say that the story about the
ethicist and his opinion
was presented a little bit out of
context
so when i first heard it it just sounded
straight up racist and that was my first
impression
but when you hear the actual argument
and you understand that there is no
non-racist outcome
you can't get there it's not a
possibility it's only who gets
who gets the advantage and if you decide
that it's going to be a little racist
but you're going to do it based on the
greatest risk
that's about as good as you can do it's
about as good as you can do
now if you told me that every black
person would get the vaccination before
every white person that doesn't make
sense but if you're talking
equal to equal let's say a black guy
who's 63 years old and has a little
asthma
i would i would put him in front of me
in line
because it's a war if this were a
competition
and i were competing against my fellow
citizen
yeah i'd push him off the cliff right
if i treated this as a competition i'm
gonna get mine
and i'm gonna make sure you don't get
mine before i get mine
but it's not it's a war so if i were
competing against black people
sure i'll do what i have to do to
compete but they're on the same team
so i'm going to treat it like like a
military operation
all right there's a new site
that's sorting the news in a useful way
i think a lot of testing on how to get
our news better
you know better platforms or better ways
to present the news so it's
less biased would be good for testing so
i'm not going to say that
this particular one and its url is
tidyreport.com tidytidyreport.com
what they do is they organize the tweets
which of course usually connect to the
news directly
so they organize the i think it's mostly
the political tweets
by positive neutral and negative so in
other words whether the tweet is saying
something positive
or negative about the topic or neutral
and whether the person saying it
is associated with the left or the right
i'm not sure exactly how they
figure that out but they're probably
close so it's called tidyreport.com i
neither
recommend it nor disrecommend it the
important part of the story is that
people are starting to a b
test different ways to present the news
to get past this
immense bias situation so check it out
maybe
maybe that's one of the ones
pompeo uh so mike pompeo says that
uh we're that the russians are quote
pretty clearly behind the cyber attack
what does pretty clearly mean does
pretty clearly mean
we're sure of it is that the same
is pretty clearly i don't know if that
means they're
they're positive it's an interesting
choice of words
but it's somewhere in that neighborhood
of high high confidence
or high likelihood and some experts are
saying
what what i think is unfortunately
obvious that the only way you would be
able to get rid
of whatever access russia has had for
apparently a long time
the only way you'd be able to get rid of
it is to replace all of your software
all of it because the the apple
the the allegation which is probably
pretty reasonable
is that once they had god access to all
of the systems
they could embed you know viruses in
different places to be activated under
different situations
or open up different doors etc so it
wouldn't matter
how how good you were at finding a
problem
because they would just open up a new
door as quickly as you found it
so you pretty much have to get rid of
all of it
i wonder if we have the technology to do
that
let me give you uh let me flush this out
a little bit flush it out or flush it
down a little bit
i always get those confused flesh it out
you flesh it out right that's that's the
saying so the idea is this could you
write
a software application that's
main purpose is to remove all the
software
in a company and replace it with the
clean version of the same software
so in other words could you write some
kind of a
master god program that would take every
piece of software at ibm
delete it and i don't know how hard you
have to delete it maybe there's like you
have to extra delete bleach it or
something
just get rid of all of it and
reload the same fresh you know things so
you keep your databases so
none of your data would be directly
affected so i don't think there's a
problem with data
i guess i'm not that technical that i
can answer that question would we have
any issue with a
just a raw database i don't know if that
can hold a virus
but if you get ever get rid of
everything just wipe everything
that has any software element to it in
your system
could you write one giant program that
just rolled through
a fortune 500 company took it down for
an hour
it is just done for an hour but an hour
later is reloaded all of its software
rebooted in the right order
and and brought everything back up could
you do it
is it is that a thing yeah let me give
you um
a little bit of history do you remember
when the year 2000 bug
was coming when the year 2000 bug was
coming all the experts
experts said we don't have enough time
we're in real trouble because the
companies are not taking it seriously
and that date is coming when year 2000
bug will hit
and all computers that were you know
designed before a certain date
can't handle the year 2000 as a date and
they'll all crash and the world will
will end and as that was approaching
and we were getting cl we were actually
in the year 2000 and we're getting you
know
or no we're getting close to the year
2000. yeah because closer and closer and
closer
i was saying in public we're fine
we'll be fine now here's the reason that
all the experts said no it can't be done
it's too much work
you know if everybody worked on it full
time you just couldn't get it done
we're doomed and i said exactly the
opposite i said no we'll be fine
what happened what happened is we were
fine
now why is that well exactly what i
predicted
that it would take a long time to do it
manually
but it wouldn't take a long time to
figure out how not to do it manually
in other words it wouldn't take that
long to write programs
that would do what the humans would have
to do that would take a long time
and what happened people wrote programs
that looked for these bugs and corrected
them
and then they ran the programs the bugs
were corrected
the year 2000 came bam
we're fine so until you could imagine
that it was possible to write software
that would
fix you know universally go out there
and find and fix all the bugs that you
didn't even know where they were
uh you thought you were doomed i think
we might
find a similar maybe an industry
could be a whole industry pops up maybe
a consulting industry with
some kind of technical background and i
would guess
that we will probably birth an industry
because of this because of the hacks
that go in
and shut down your whole network and
wipe it and then reload it
and you know they control the process so
nothing gets out of control
and and they just go rescue one company
at a time
i feel like that's going to be in the
industry
really soon and should be and i think
that'll be the only answer because the
we should assume that people will get so
far
into our systems again that we'll just
be right back in this situation
right so even if we found every bug and
got rid of it
it would just reproduce i mean you know
even if we got them all
which is impossible probably but even if
we did they would just hack back in
and you know we'd you know they'd find
another way in so you need some way to
wipe
all of your software every now and then
every bit of it
and that i think that'll become an
industry um
here's the funniest thing that's
happened uh lately
if you don't follow this twitter account
you really should
it's a parody account uh and
the name on the account is uh titania
mcgrath and there's a little photo of a
youngish blonde woman with sort of
glasses like mine
and what's brilliant about it besides
the fact that it's brilliantly written
is that it's a parody account that is so
close to reality
people are often fooled which is part of
the joke
so a lot of people who see this account
for the first time really can't tell
and and something happened
that uh a thread that uh
to titania or whoever runs the account
tweeted that just is amazing
and here's why i've been telling you for
a while that parody and reality have
merged
such that there's not really that much
difference
between a wild parody and what you're
actually observing
you want to see an example of that
titania in her thread gives you several
examples of predictions
that she or whoever runs the account
made
that were pure parity that have already
happened
in other words the parody came before
the reality
but listen to this list it's freaking
mind-blowing all right you ready
so these are the claims in titania's
thread
um she said on december 2018 i calls for
biological sex to be removed from birth
certificates
now that was parody we're gonna take
your biological sex off of your
uh birth certificate said that in 2018
in 2020 the new england journal of
medicine concurred
so the new england journal of medicine
is now recommending
in 2020 what titania said as purely a
joke
in 2018. purely a joke
is that the only one well i mean if this
had only happened once
if it only happened once you'd say oh
that's a funny coincidence
right if it only happened once
so uh on and also in 2018 titania
criticized
julie andrews who played mary poppins in
the movie
for having chimney soot on her face
because you know that was in the middle
of the blackface stuff
so as purely a joke she tweeted that
and criticized julie andrews for having
chimney smoke on her face in the movie
that was in 2018. in 2019 the new york
times concurred
so the new york times basically took on
julie andrews for having so on her face
and blackface
it was literally a joke two years before
it became real
is that the only ones oh no i'm not even
close to being done
so the thing that's funny is not the
individual examples because they're
they're sort of trivial what's funny is
how often it happened
it's the often part that makes the makes
the joke all right here's another one
uh march 2019 titania published a book
called
woke in which i argue that sky
skyscrapers
are oppressive phallic symbols
in july 2020 the guardian concurred
so in 2019 literally
joking the sky creep skyscrapers are you
know some
oppressive phallic symbols and then the
guardian writes a serious article one
year later saying exactly that
uh in that same book in 2019 here's
here's the
like the finisher uh she go in 2019
in her book also the same book woke i
called for
i called out helen keller for her white
privilege
time magazine just did that in reality
now this is just a sample the the actual
thread is longer i just picked out some
of the fun ones
but when you see how many times parody
in reality overlapped
it's it changes you i mean this is this
is one of those things where
you know i've i've predicted this i
predicted it often
and in public that parity and reality
were on the way to merging
and then to watch it in real time it
actually merged
did that sound like a real prediction
when i said it the first time you heard
me say
parody and reality are merging that
didn't sound
exactly technically real right it
sounded more like
humorous hyperbole
no i meant it and it happened
so there you go all right speaking of
predictions one of my other predictions
is that
history would get complicated because we
would no longer have one of them
we would have more than one history and
then if you went to school
it might be a problem because you're
trying to learn history
and there are two of them and they're
different
which one do you believe did you think
that that was going to happen
my prediction that there would be two
histories
well here we are president trump
he unveiled his choices for the
president's advisory
1776 commission so this will be a
commission to make recommendations about
how to push against the 1619 project
that is already in schools so the
president has literally
created a commission to create an
alternate history
to compete with the history that's
already being taught in the schools
two histories literally
being taught in schools now
when i said to you we get a problem here
because we have two histories
like we've never had before did that
sound real to you
the first time you heard that's like no
we'll we'll still agree on one history
nope literally we're teaching two
histories
if if this commission goes forward i
don't know how much time they have
before biden scraps it so i don't i
can't imagine they get much done
but there you are two histories
all right um the most
interesting claim about election fraud
that i've seen comes from kane
koa the great uh it's a twitter account
so uh i think maybe kanakoa
k a n e k o a
the great al all one word kind of coed
the great a good follow he's got lots of
stuff i don't know who he is but he's
got lots of good content
so he made a twitter thread which i'll
talk about uh
but before i talk about it do you
remember the the golden rule
of all election fraud claims the golden
rule
well it's not golden but it's a rule 95
of all the election claims you hear are
fake
or not real or mistaken or out of
context or something
but i also believe there's a hundred
percent chance the election was stolen
because it was easy
and people had the motive to do it so of
course it's still it's always stolen
under those conditions
but any specific claim you hear
probably bs now i'm going to give you a
specific claim
after telling you that every specific
claim is probably bs
i will i'm going to apply the same
standard to this one
now this one sounds really good
okay so i'm going to give you an
argument here
that on paper you know on paper
it's really really strong but is it true
i don't know i would just apply my
standard
to it 95 chances not but here it is
so there is a uh a working professional
statistician somebody who is very
capable and experienced and in the
in the sweet spot of his career so
somebody who really really
really understands statistics
so this is the source and there's a
video from the statistician
explaining what he did so the first
thing you need to know is that the
person making the claim
is very qualified right now that doesn't
mean it's true
right because we'll talk about experts
and when you should
trust them but just know that he's very
qualified
and what he did was he was just sort of
messing around with a lot of the data
you know he explained it as almost a
hobby something that the statisticians
liked it was like oh
i wonder if there's a correlation
between this thing and that thing
and he discovered somewhat just by
poking around
a correlation that almost is impossible
to be natural
meaning it's a signal for fraud with
something like a greater than 99
chance that it is really fraud and not
some
fake signal now does that mean it's true
no remember we're only dealing with
claims that you and i can't check
i don't have the skill to check it i
don't know where the data was
i can't really check it so no matter how
credible this sounds
just keep this little tape playing in
the back of your head no matter how
credible it sounds
there's a 95 percent chance it's not
real
okay just keep that playing in the back
of your head here's what he found
if you took the 3 000 u.s counties i
always wondered how many
counties there were which is weird i was
wondering that exact question
there are over 3 000 counties now
counties have a lot in common
right there could be a lot of diversity
within a county
but you can make some claims about
their consistency over time and the
statistician started out by predicting
predicting who would win each county
based on
a number of demographic variables so he
would say how many democrats are in the
county
what's their age a bunch of stuff
and he found that he could predict with
90 percent accuracy
who the county would go for based on
their demographics and you could apply
it retrospectively to other
elections and i guess it works so it's
about 90 good
and knowing in advance who would win and
then he looked at
who actually won and
he found eventually he poked around and
found this
strange data oddity that
there were lots of uh there are lots of
counties that did better than his model
would predict
and there were lots of counties that did
worse than his model would predict
and that's quite natural so if you've
got 3 000
data points they're they're going to be
spread around
but his point was you could draw a line
through the middle
and that would be his prediction and and
the the differences would
just be sort of equally on both sides of
the line
so if there was if he was off it was
just as likely he was off
you know in one way versus the other so
it'd be just as much below the lines
above the line and then he found
that in those counties that used
dominion voting systems and
one other kind i think heart heart or
something
there was another company hart h-a-r-t
so there i guess there are maybe six or
so different machines and different
counties and different ways to account
but in those counties they had dominion
or heart
systems they were consistently
over five percent more votes than would
be expected
for a biden now here's the interesting
part
the correlation holds in trump counties
so counties that trump won biden did
five percent better
in counties that you knew that biden was
going to win because they always go
democrat
also a little bit more than five percent
better
so the amount that the uh dominion
and heart machine counting counties were
off
was um was consistent
meaning that there was a gigantic
difference let me see if i can say this
simply because i'm
watching this if you looked at what you
expected these counties to do based on
their demographics and
past behavior etc the ones that had
dominion
and heart machines were uh way way
i think 73 percent of them had a biden
advantage that was very similar
now the odds of only those two machines
having 73 percent of the oddities going
in the same direction
but in the other counties those oddities
went in both directions equally
but only where you had the dominion or
heart machines
you didn't have an even distribution
it's the only time
and it's very consistent and according
to the statistician not according to me
that the odds of any of that being
anything but fraud
are vanishing vanishingly small
you know you could say it might be
something else in the
you know in the extreme you know it was
alien invasion or something
but not really not really now this is
very different
from the quadrillions argument the
quadrillions argument was debunked right
so the quadrillion argument is that um
if there's let's say a belt a bellwether
place
that always went to republicans and this
is the only time it didn't
you know that that's a signal and then
there's
this other signal and this other signal
that is not good analysis because all it
would take is one big effect
that could affect all of those things
right so
that's not a guaranteed signal of fraud
but this is really specific because it
you can trace it all the way down to
this specific vendor
and if you can trace the difference down
to specific vendors
that's a really stronger case i think
now i don't know if uh
andreas beckhaus is watching this uh
video but if you are
uh uh that he'd be the best debunker of
things that i say so debunk me on
twitter if
i've uh missed any anything obvious so i
took this
and uh i sent the link to my democrat
friend
that i always mentioned that my
anti-trump democrat friend
who has the qualities of being very
smart and well informed
and yet appears to act crazy
he's completely rational in fact one of
the most rational people i know
in all other domains he's just like this
really rational guy
it practically defines who he is he's so
rational
and i sent him this the uh sent him the
statistical analysis and as luck would
have it
he's also good at statistics so one of
his
talent stacks is statistics so i send
him a statistical argument
to a guy who really knows statistics now
it's not the same harris
it's a personal friend nobody you know
and
and here's why i did it my friend
says and has been saying that there's no
evidence that there is anything
fraudulent so that that's his view no
evidence
so i sent him this evidence but here
but the evidence has a special quality
to it
that no matter how much you know about
statistics
you can't really just look at it and
know if it's right right
you you can't tell so this expert is
making an argument
that unless you probably unless you
really dug into his work
you can't tell if it's real so i did
this
intentionally not as uh here i've proven
my case
because i don't think anything like
that's happened remember 95
of all evidence is fake this is no
different so i didn't think it was a
kill shot
but the reason i showed it to him is
because i knew he wouldn't know it
wasn't
and he wouldn't know if it was because
it can't be known it's just too hard to
know it
based on what we have available to us
and i wondered if he would reject it
or would he say okay this does not prove
fraud and i would agree with that but
it certainly tells us we should look
into it
so that's what i was looking for i was
looking for a rational
response that says you know scott i know
a lot about statistics too
but i don't have access to all the data
he has if he did this analysis right it
would be very meaningful
and it does look like he's capable
capable of doing the analysis
if it's right this is something that
would be important and should be looked
into
so that's what a reasonable person would
say right
do you think he said that nope
perfectly reasonable to say it didn't
prove anything and i agree
here's what he said you can find any
correlation
in lots of data now this is what i would
call the bible code
theory the bible code is a debunked
it was a an idea that if you looked in
the bible
and you did various schemes to find
secret messages you would find all these
messages
such as i'll just pick one this is
random not a real one if you took the
second letter of the first
sentence but you took the third letter
of the next sentence and then the fourth
letter to the next sentence
so there's all these little algorithms
that would run against the bible
and it would spit out things that you
didn't think could possibly be
you know uh natural so it'd be like
little predictions and you'd say yes
look it's like a full sentence
prediction
and it actually happened so there was a
time when people thought the bible had
these secret codes
that was debunked by some scientists who
took their same
algorithms and ran it against any big
book
like war and peace turns out war and
peace
is full of secret messages and
predictions that actually came true
because it turns out that if you've got
something as complicated as a big book
filled with letters you can find some
algorithm that will
produce full sentences just by trial and
error
and they will look like predictions that
happened so it can work with any book
it's obviously not
the bible code so his argument was that
this statistician
had basically fallen for the bible code
error does that sound like a good
response
to here's a video by a hugely qualified
statistician
are there any hugely qualified
statisticians
who don't know about the bible code
there are none there are none that's not
a thing
there's no such thing as a professional
a professional
statistician who's never heard of this
problem with the bible code that's not a
thing obviously
the statistician was aware that that's
you know one of the risks that you have
to guard against
so i feel as if this is a pretty clean
example of cognitive dissonance the
reasonable reaction would have been
i can't evaluate this but if it's right
it's meaningful right is that not the
only reasonable response
to something you can't analyze but looks
important and an expert did it
all right
so uh
or the other the other thing my democrat
friend said as a response is that the
courts have rejected
all of the evidence that was presented
it's just mind-boggling so my my
democrat friend because
the the news is so fake he believes that
courts have looked at evidence of fraud
that never happened he actually thinks
that happened
it didn't happen apparently he was
unaware that the cases are being thrown
out for technicalities
without actually looking at the claims
you know it's about standing and
doctrinal latches and
you know whether or not you can bring
the case and who's got
you know you know who's got jurisdiction
it's all that stuff
but as far as i know the the claims per
se
have not been judged in any court of law
i haven't
i don't know that the witnesses who make
direct
claims of observing fraud have they
had their day in court no
right so here's a well-informed really
well-informed
guy but his information comes from
the left and actually thinks
an alternate history of the united
states is happening right now he
believes there's an alternate history
happening in parallel with the one
you're experiencing
in which those claims are being debunked
by courts
nothing like that's happened nothing
even close to that has happened
they've never even looked at it beyond
that
would it make any difference that other
claims were debunked
[Laughter]
does it matter how many people are found
innocent of a crime
let's say this let's say three people
were accused of a crime and you found
out they didn't do it does that tell you
the
the fourth person who is accused of an
unrelated crime does that tell you the
fourth person didn't do it
it doesn't really work that way right
anyway
trump signed some legislation that would
kick chinese companies off of
the u.s stock exchanges unless those
companies
allow financial audits that are required
for
you know american companies that are on
those exchanges
to which i say why did this take so long
are you telling me that there are
chinese companies on american exchanges
who simply decide not to abide by the
very very very important rules of
transparency
that all american companies abide by or
else they get penalized
greatly are you telling me that china
can just be on our stock exchange
and ignore all the rules that were
required
the important ones not even the trivia
ones like the most important one
is you've got to have some transparency
that's that's like right at the top
that's not a detail right
and so trump signs this legislation that
will kick them off if they don't allow
these audits
and i'm thinking why did that take so
long
you know and do you think this would
have happened under biden
do you because i feel like probably it
wouldn't
um it's going to be fun watching trump
try to get things done
you know between now and inauguration
day we'll see how much trouble he can
cause
all right let me teach you when to
disagree with the experts because of
course we all do it
but there's a good way to do it and a
bad way to do it and this will be your
important lesson of the day you ready
okay
here's what you should not do do not
disagree with experts
and then cite as your reason for
disagreeing with the experts
a fact which all the experts know
okay i just gave you an example that all
the experts in statistics
know about the bible code so stating
that as the reason for your argument
doesn't make any sense because the
expert knows that
right here's some more examples of that
um i've heard the argument that
co2 can't be causing a climate
crisis because co2 used to be much
higher
in the in the past you've heard this
argument right people say climate change
isn't real
because co2 used to be way way higher in
the past and there were
there was no civilization back then if
there were no humans
and co2 was way higher in the past and
things seem to be fine
so it's all hoax right here's the
problem with that
every climate scientist knows
co2 was higher in the past
do you see where i'm going all the
experts who say climate change is a
problem
they know what you know that co2 was
much higher in the past
that's not a reason to argue against
them
what that proves is you don't know why
they have
you don't understand their argument
basically now um
i believe that i read once that co2 was
higher in the in
sort of the distant history of the the
earth but it was the same time that i
believed the sun was
less strong so there was some countering
force that is easy to
to demonstrate and well known so
in general if you're disagreeing with
experts
but you're using as your basis for
disagreement
a fact that every one of those experts
knows
you're almost certainly not making a
good argument you could be right
because experts sometimes are wrong and
you don't know why so you can be right
by accident
but you should check yourself and say
wait a minute
my argument is based on one fact that
the other people already know
there's got to be some other argument or
that's nothing all right
look at me here's another example
when i predicted that trump would win in
2016
i i was going against all the experts
and all the pollsters
was that smart was it smart for me to
disagree with the experts
when i was using their same data
because they knew what the polls were
we're all looking at the same data right
so i should not have disagreed with the
experts wouldn't you say
if all i were using was the same data
they were using
because they would know more than i do
plus they know the same data i know
except here's what's different i was not
using their same data i was using
my expertise which is different from
theirs
my expertise was persuasion and
as a trained persuader and other trained
persuaders saw at the same time i did
they said this isn't like the past
we've never had this skill set running
for president
and you guys don't see it coming but i'm
kind of an expert in this persuasion
stuff
and i do see it coming just like a train
like i can see it i can see it coming
right so if you disagree with the
experts
because you're bringing knowledge that
they don't have
or expertise that they don't have that
might be
a reasonable disagreement again doesn't
mean you're right and they're wrong
could go either way but at least you'd
be reasonable
that would be a reasonable way to
disagree with an expert
because you're bringing something new
that they don't have
but if you're only bringing the stuff
they already know
i think i'd lean toward the experts not
you
in that case i had one other expertise
in the case of calling trump's 2016
victory which is that
i know a lot about my white males
as a white male of a certain age i
kind of have a little more insight into
white males of a certain age
and i know what they're willing to say
out loud in public and i know what they
privately think
it's a little bit different so i'm not
sure that all the experts
had maybe the same you know experience
with this
group of people who ended up being
influential in the final
final outcome so whenever you think you
have some extra
insight or expertise or data
then maybe disagreeing with an expert
makes some sense
here's another one i've disagreed with
climate change experts about their
uh projections of how bad things will be
in 50 to 80 years
does that make sense i'm not a climate
change expert right
so if i'm disagreeing with the experts
aren't i being irrational because
there's no fact
that i know about climate change and
this is true there's no fact i know
about climate change that they don't
know
so they know all the facts that i have
plus lots more would it be reasonable
for me to disagree with them
when they know everything i know plus
the scientific method has backed them up
they say
plus the majority of experts are on the
same side plus
they know way more than i do is that
reasonable for me to disagree in that
case
well if that's all the variables that
were involved the answer is no
if there were no other variables it
wouldn't really be reasonable for me to
disagree i don't have anything to add to
it
but when you're predicting what's going
to happen financially
you're now in my ballpark because i
worked
as a person who made financial
predictions for big corporations
did it for years and i have expertise in
it
so when i'm criticizing climate change
the part i don't
criticize is the science park the
science part is
that if you add co2 to the atmosphere no
matter how it gets there
human or other no matter how it gets
there
all things be equal would that warm up
the earth
probably i'm not disagreeing with
experts because i don't have any extra
data
what extra data do i have what extra
science do i have none so when they make
a claim that co2
should warm the atmosphere all things be
equal i say
i don't have anything to add to that i'm
not going to doubt it
and i'm not going to confirm it i'm just
going to say well you're experts
you know i don't know but when you get
to the second part
which is they make a financial not a not
a scientific
but a financial estimate of what it's
going to do with the world economy
you're in my expertise so if i criticize
you from my expertise
and you're a scientist
you should listen to me
literally if a scientist
tells you to believe a financial
estimate
or a financial prediction and a
financial expert who makes these
predictions or has for a living
says no who are you going to believe the
person who knows the most about
financial predictions or a scientist
because scientists are not financial
predictors
so when i disagree with climate change
i'm not disagreeing with scientists
on science i'm disagreeing with
scientists
on my expertise not theirs my expertise
i have another expertise too which is
again persuasion
and so i have a theory of why
maybe scientists could be you know
fooled or biased or
subject to confirmation bias at least on
the financial part
financial predictions and it is you know
everything that you already know which
is that there's a group think and there
would be a penalty for going against the
green
so if you're going to disagree with the
experts
at least have a theory of why they're
wrong
so sometimes i have a theory that um
there are just too many penalties for
them to say
you're going against the grain you know
so it's cognitive dissonance or
confirmation bias
or that i have extra facts or extra
information all right here's another
example of the same thing
i see this argument all the time about
wearing masks and it goes like this
this was tweeted at me today the problem
with this
uh i'm sorry it was tweeted at me today
that
um we know masks can't work
because the the tiny holes in the mask
are way bigger than the even tinier
virus
now most of you have probably made this
argument right how many of you have made
this argument
scott scott scott the scientists have
looked
they've seen that the masks have these
big holes on them when you go
microscopic and and the hole is this big
the virus is the size of a p
you know let's say relatively speaking
the virus is the size of a p
the holes the tiny holes in the mask
would be the size of let's say
a basketball hoop how does a basketball
hoop
stop something that's the size of a p
right have you made that argument
yourself
raise your hand if you've ever made that
argument if you did you're just
you would know you're disagreeing with
the majority of experts who say the
masks
work now here's my test
do you think that the do you think that
the experts
who say masks don't work who say that
masks
do work do you think they're unaware
of your pee going through a basketball
hoop
brilliant analogy because if they're
aware of that fact
then you're adding nothing to it it's a
fact they know
it's a fact you know that the size of
the holes in the masks are
so big and the virus itself is smaller
do you think they don't know that the
experts
i'm pretty sure all of the experts know
that
but they know everything you know which
is let's say that fact
and more all right so they know
everything you know
they know that big hole and little virus
exists
but the other thing they know is that
it's been tested in a variety of real
real world um situations and
in the real world the evidence is very
strong that
mask work so they're aware that when you
test it in a
laboratory you can you can come up with
a very good reason why
maybe you wouldn't but it might have to
do with the water droplets being bigger
than the virus itself so maybe they
don't get through the the basketball
hoop
could be that it changes the direction
or the viral load we don't know why
don't know why but the point is
if the experts know everything you know
about the size of that virus
there's something you don't know and
that's what you should take away from it
you shouldn't take away from it
that the the experts are lying
if they know more than you do now how
often have i
uh disagreed with the experts and let me
let me see if i'm consistent with my own
rules of knowing when to agree or
disagree with experts
when the question came up of closing
travel from china
the virology experts said
in the very early days no you don't need
to do that
and i disagreed with vehement
cursing public statements that we should
close
the travel from china immediately
now who was right well i was right i
think history shows that i was right
that we should have closed
china travel as early as i said which
was well before
trump did it which i think was a week
later and
but was i so even though i was right
let's examine if i was right for the
right reason
okay so what was it that i added to this
to the experts if the expert says say
it's not a risk
why should i say it you know what do i
know that the experts don't know
and here's what i do know risk
management
are scientists experts in risk
management
because if you study the economics and
if you have an mba
and a lot of experience in business as i
do i would consider myself not like a
world expert in risk management but
certainly it's my expertise
so understanding risk and making
decisions in the context of risk
management
is what you learn when you get an mba
it's what you learn in business
i'm good at it so when i looked at this
situation
i didn't say i'm smarter than
epidemiologists
i said i don't think they understand
risk management
because they're there the risk is
catastrophic
and here we are right we knew the risk
was catastrophic
we knew that it would be expensive to
close travel but it would be
better than catastrophic so from a risk
management perspective it was kind of a
no-brainer
that anybody who understood my expertise
risk management would have found that an
easy decision and in fact
who was it who famously you know
followed on pretty quickly was trump
would you say that trump is also uh
an epidemiologist no is he
an expert on risk management yes
yes that's exactly what he is in in the
same
way that i am if you're experienced with
business
you are somebody who's been making risk
management decisions
for decades yeah trump
is very very experienced at risk
management
so if you're disagreeing with the
experts because you bring a different
expertise
that can be valid doesn't mean you're
right but it could be a valid
disagreement
when the experts were first saying that
masks don't work
before they said they do i called that
a lie on day one now did i call
it a lie because of my expertise and
virology
and the physics of masks
no i brought a different expertise to
that
and that different expertise is that as
the creator of dilbert and somebody
who's worked in business for a long time
i know how big organizations work
and i know that big organizations will
routinely
lie to manage behavior
and it occurred to me that since we were
talking about a shortage of masks
at the same time we were talking the
experts were saying nah you don't need a
mask
but maybe the healthcare workers do need
them no you don't need them save them
for the healthcare workers it won't make
any difference
it seemed very likely to me
that they were making the decision to
manage the shortage
and it was not an actual scientific
statement
so in this case my expertise in
bureaucracies and how they lie to manage
resources i applied to this situation
and with no understanding of
epidemiology or the size of the physics
of the masks
i correctly predicted that they were
lying
and that was the truth
how about what i said early on in the
pandemic and i was saying that we should
at least do a major test and really
really quickly on hydroxychloroquine
because if it worked as claimed it would
be huge
if it didn't work well it's not much
risk
it's pretty low risk compared to the
pandemic now
my current thinking is
hydroxychloroquine
almost certainly at this point we could
say
wasn't the game changer i don't know if
it works a little
but it certainly isn't working so well
that everybody's adopting it we would
know that by now
in my opinion but was i right or wrong
in saying we should go hard at
hydroxychloroquine
in the in the environment of not knowing
whether it worked or not
i was 100 right as was trump
not right that it works but right that
there's enough evidence that works that
we should go hard at it
and know for sure because we tested it
rigorously that we should just go at it
as hard as possible
and at least eliminate it as a
possibility
at least eliminate it so i think i was
right on that as well
all right
so swalwell it turns out the the
information is that there's some
confirmation that he did actually have a
sexual
fling with the chinese spy um fang
so here's my take we know that swalwell
pushed the russia collusion hoax
harder than anybody except adam schiff
and
we know that it was a hoax and we know
that that was very bad for the country
and so
what swalwell did was unambiguously very
bad for the country
but it could have also been just a
mistake
right and i think that you have to allow
that your people that you elect in
congress are going to make some mistakes
so i don't know that you would
necessarily fire somebody
for pushing the fine people i'm sorry
for pushing the
russia collusion hoax because maybe he
believed it
right maybe he was just wrong that's not
the worst thing in the world and if
democrats said well we like him in
general
and even though he pushed this hoax or
maybe they believe the hoax i don't know
so maybe that's not enough to lose your
job
you could argue it is but maybe not
for the at least his voters and then
there's a question of
having a fling with a chinese spy let's
say he didn't know it
that's the reporting right the reporting
is he didn't know she was a chinese spy
should you lose your job if you
had a relationship with somebody that
you didn't know was a spy
and the moment you found out you cut
contact
i don't think so i don't think you
should lose your job
for being fooled by a spy if
especially if there's no damage that you
can identify
so you got two things that are sort of
really close
to something you should get fired for
but individually
i don't know now suppose you added them
together
he did two bad things he didn't do one
bad thing he did two bad things
is that enough to fire him well i don't
know
i so i suppose that would be subjective
but here's the thing
those two things he did wrong are not
unrelated
meaning that a chinese spy you would
expect
to want you to put pressure on russia
and away from china
now we don't know if that's why
swallowell did what he did
we don't know if swallow was motivated
persuaded or brainwashed in any way
to push the russia collusion hoax all we
know
is that we watched it and if these two
facts are true
that you saw uh swalwell going
balls to the wall to do something that a
chinese spy would certainly want him to
do
which has put all the pressure on on
russia and you know
hurt the integrity of our elections and
question everything et cetera
he did exactly what a spy would want him
to do a chinese spy
now that doesn't mean he did it because
of that
but we don't know
that's grounds for removal the fact that
we don't know
if the only reason he damaged the
country so badly
is because he was influenced by a
chinese spy
it doesn't matter if you can prove there
was a connection between those stories
the fact that what he did was so
perfectly exactly what a spy would want
him to do
that's enough even if he's completely
innocent you can't have that person in
public office
and i feel that that could be you know
unfair to him
now i've told you before i've i've met
uh eric swalwell a few times
because he knows some people i know and
in local
you know local parties and stuff so he's
been around a little bit
and so i i don't have bad feelings about
him as a human being
and i don't like people who lose their
jobs over politics and stuff like this
but this is sort of a no-brainer this
isn't one of those situations where you
can put
the the well-being of eric swalwell over
the well-being of
the credibility of the republic he's
just less important than the republic
and i think he's got to go i don't think
i
and and by the way i'm positive i would
say this if he were republican
i don't know if you would you know your
your mileage might vary
but i'm positive i would have the same
opinion no matter his politics
so i said provocatively that although i
oppose all violence and i do
that if conservatives don't start
planning now to control the streets
they'll never win another election
there's no point in having an election
because for all practical purposes
whoever controls
violence in the country runs the country
let me say that again because it's one
of those things it takes you a while to
like connect the dots whoever controls
violence meaning you can get away with
it
is the government effectively
right even if they're not the government
in name
whoever can control violence is in
charge
there's no exception to that that's not
like a
a bias or a hey there's a correlation
is is it's a definition
whoever controls violence in the country
runs the country
every time no exception all right and we
watched
that the um you know antifa and black
lives matter and democrats
they controlled violence in the streets
and there's good reason to believe that
that
affected the supreme court to want to
stay out of the election
because they didn't want more violence
so under this situation where violence
appears to be our political system now
if you want to
not have that be your government you
know
street violence the only response to
that since the police appear
apparently are have been neutered you
know politically neutered
the police aren't going to help you and
it looks like we're not going to
employ the army and because that would
have its own problems the only
way that this gets fixed that i can
think of is that the number of
conservatives who show up
is way more than the number of
other people who might have violence on
their mind now
don't bring guns don't bring knives or
bombs
like i'm not suggesting that anybody
bring weapons of death
to any kind of uh an event but if antifa
were outnumbered five to one
in in the street where they were trying
to make trouble
five to one would probably
make a lot of these things go away so
uh i would say that uh if i if
if conservatives don't actually
literally organize
and have names of people who have signed
up to literally go onto the street
the moment it's needed and you don't
have you know five times as many of them
there's no point in having an election
there really isn't because
and the proud boys have up
everything let me say this
i don't have a problem with uh the proud
boys
stated philosophy i know they're accused
of things which is
not within their stated philosophy
they're accused of being
racist or whatever but that's not part
of their their deal
i don't know if any of them are racist
they're probably racist everywhere
but the proud boys unfortunately they
brought their their brand
into the mix and while i believe that
they were well-intentioned
in many cases sometimes i think they
just like to fight but i think they were
sort of well-intentioned they're
patriots
but they completely up the
situation because
you know they they drew all the
attention and they were too easy to
paint as the bad guys
the people who need to be in the street
needs to be everybody but them
even though they're the most capable in
terms of fighting uh the most effective
the most effective would be people who
are not part of an organization
you don't want them to show up and say
hey we're proud boys you want people to
show up and say we're conservatives or
we want to save the country or patriots
or something you don't want them
part of a club as soon as you make them
part of a club
then anybody who does something bad in
the club
messes up the whole thing right so as
soon as you say
it's a club any one bad apple in that
club ruins the whole club in terms of
political opinion
so just don't bring a club i mean an
organization club you can
you know the other club probably a bad
idea too
so you think lawyers are pretty good at
arguing right you'd say that
maybe artists are not good at it but
lawyers are real good at it and
i hear a lawyer ross garber who is
literally a
an impeachment lawyer and he teaches at
tulane law school so a very qualified
guy
in the law and he tweeted this to me he
said i have done election investigations
mostly on behalf of republicans so he's
saying that he's
sort of unbiased here and then he and he
said i have seen
lots of misconduct and irregularities so
here's a person who's experienced
and he knows that elections can have
lots of conduct and irregularities
because he's seen it himself
so far so good and he said i expressed
concern
heading into this election even better
he's not only seen a lot of fraud
in elections but he warned us about this
election so far so good
and then he said but i have not seen
evidence of potentially result
changing problems and then he referred
to my analogy about the no melted ice
cream
does that seem like a good argument
is that a world-class lawyer argument
there
because i'm pretty sure there are a lot
of things in this world
that i haven't seen that actually
happened
for example suppose you were to witness
a murder by
gunfire and you saw the person take out
the gun aim it at the victim
pull the trigger bang and then the
victim gets a hole in their body and
they go ah
and they die and that's what that's what
you you witnessed
can you say that you witnessed
the person with the gun shooting the
victim
who the bullet entered and died
can you say you saw that no
because you can't see the bullet right
you saw the gun go off
and you know what guns do you saw the
person with a bullet hole
and you logically connected them
but did you see it no because if you
can't see the bullet
you don't know the bullet actually came
out of the gun
you don't know if somebody behind him
shot him now of course if you do the
ballistics you'll find out
but in terms of witnessing there are a
lot of things we don't see
such as actually watching the bullet
that you know happened
because you heard the gun go off you saw
it where it's aimed you saw the result
you don't have to see it all you don't
have to see every bit of it
so likewise the uh here's a guy
who has seen enough election fraud
personally that he knows
it can happen so he knows it can happen
because he's seen a lot of it
and he knows that the incentive to do it
this election was sky high
that's all you need to know it can be
done
which he confirms because he's seen a
lot of it and the
and the motivation was sky high you
don't need to see the bullet
to know that it happened i think his
argument was
poor um
and i got a few other things that i
don't think are interesting enough to
talk about so i won't
and that my friends
is the end of coffee with scott adams
for today i think it's
maybe the best one i've done so far
today don't you think
all right i'm just going to look at your
comments for a moment because i've been
looking at my notes
oh yes the space force
how did i skip that one the space force
has decided that the name
for their uh fighters
the name for their military people will
be guardians
they'll be called guardians what do you
think of that
i don't like it at all
i wanted to like it but i don't
number one it reminds you of the you
know movie guardians of the galaxy
so automatically it feels silly because
you know there's a
talking raccoon in that movie and so
guardians of the universe makes that's
what i think of
and so it makes it seem less serious so
that's not good
but here's the other part the problem
for me
is that they're in heaven meaning that
they're in space
so they're they're sort of up there like
like god basically you know in an
analogy
sense and there's something about the
word guardian
that feels religious
guardian doesn't sound military and
maybe that's what they wanted
but guardian doesn't really sound like
the right word
guardian feels like a cult
i guess that's what it is i just
realized that that's what it is the word
guardian doesn't sound like a military
term it sounds like a cult
in in nexium the uh
the cult we've been talking about what
was the name they had for
uh or at least in the the subpart of
nexium where
uh keith randiri had his his uh
uh let's say his disciples i don't know
lovers disciples um so he was called
vanguard so in the context of
an actual alleged cult
uh the name that they used for their
leader was a vanguard
guardian feels like that word doesn't it
it feels just a little bit more like a
cult
than it does like a military thing so
that's my opinion um i don't think it's
important
i think any name you put on it's gonna
be fine and
uh somebody says vanguard yeah
yeah i understand that a guardian is one
who guards
and you know it's not that it's not
technically
accurate enough i don't have any better
ideas
so i'm not i don't think it's a big deal
that's all i got for now and i will talk
to you
tomorrow all right all you
youtubers i'm still here for you for a
moment
um
she should have gone with starch
startership at troopers
troopers wouldn't be bad
um orbiteers the orbiteers
that's not bad tara keepers what's that
mean
that's right i love you the most on
periscope it's true
space force tubins i don't think that's
going to catch on
did they ever admit about lying about
masks they did yeah
fouchy did in a sense in a sense because
they admitted there was a shortage
problem um have i seen stand-up math's
channel no
where's my cat i don't know she needs to
he needs to give me some love all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
