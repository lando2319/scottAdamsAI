everybody and welcome to the new and
improved coffee with Scott Adams what's
new what's improved I am I am yeah I got
off of a dangerous pharmaceutical drug
that was uh
felt like it was killing me
do you know why that drug felt like it
was killing me
it was actually literally killing me
not the drug itself
but it did make me suicidal
that was the drug
because the moment I was off it you know
one day off it weeks and weeks of
serious mental difficulty
gone
and you might want to ask yourself if
you're on any drugs that correspond with
a huge change in your mental state just
asking the question
now I have to figure out some way to get
my blood pressure back down
yeah that's a secondary problem but I've
completely cured my physical and mental
problem that had taken me out for months
I mean I was a basket case for months it
was just a bill stop taking it
well if you would like to take your
experience up a notch
to be as happy as I am right now which
is pretty happy all you need is a copper
mugger glass attacker Chelsea Stein the
canteen jugular flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing makes everything better
it's called
the simultaneousip
go
uh the biggest downside
is I can't drink afternoon coffee
if I'm not taking my my blood pressure
meds because it just spikes your coffee
through the roof your blood pressure
through
however
because I was not on the drug I was not
tired yesterday so I didn't eat coffee
because it was the drug that was making
me tired
another binding like gaff uh once again
he
referred to the vice president as the
president she said happy birthday to our
great president
now a lot of people
tweeted that video around and said
here's another example
of uh Biden confusing the job title of
the vice president but I'm not so sure
that's what happened
here's what he said
happy birthday to our great president
I have a suspicion
that he didn't just confuse her job
title
I think he forgot her name
I think he forgot her name
and and the uh
the alternative to calling her by her
job title which is what you do if you
forget somebody's name it's like ah I'd
like you to meet my boss whose name I
can't remember for some reason
uh
I think that was a cover for not
remembering her name
not sure I mean it's actually not that
uncommon to refer to people by their job
title in that specific situation but it
feels kind of like maybe he didn't know
her name for a moment I don't know
now on top of that
also this morning he did his Biden end
of speech thing
where he doesn't he looks like he's lost
for a while
and you say my God what's wrong with
that guy he always looks lost he doesn't
know where to walk and then he does the
hand thing
where he tries to point in one direction
to get some like he's shaking hands with
a ghost but really he's not doing that
that's just what the Republicans say
he's actually pointing in the direction
he plans to walk
and he's just looking for verification
that that's the direction he's supposed
to be going but it looks like he's
shaking hands with a ghost
now
do you think that that's Biden's problem
are those Biden mistakes that he always
looks confused when he leaves
that's not
that is not his problem
that that is his staff
failing him as hard as you can fail
let me tell you how easy this would be
to fix
now number one they're clearly aware
that every time he does this it becomes
a viral video right wouldn't you say
clearly they know
that this becomes a meme every time he
does it and that can't be good
how hard would it be to make that stop
the drug I was talking about was a
m
moodidine the modaline it's a beta
blocker
blood pressure med
to answer your question sorry I
digressed
um
but here here's what the handlers the
staff should have done
once you realize that Biden doesn't
remember which way to go when he's done
and let me hear some inside knowledge
when I was doing a lot of public
corporate speaking in front of big
groups the organizers always tell you
which way to accent
that that's always there
you know if anybody's done any big like
Keynotes you can verify right the the
keynote address the speaker is always
told always which way to exit that's
just basically part of the the job right
they tell you how to how to enter
they'll even tell you if you're going to
shake hands with the moderator
so the the normal way that you're being
managed backstage before you go on would
be all right you're going to enter from
this side
um and after the introduction and you'll
Shake ends and then you'll do your thing
when you're done there'll be some music
playing and there'll be some people
asking for autographs or whatever and
they'll be on this side so make sure you
exit on this side and the the organizer
might give you like a little award or
something for coming so make sure you
stay there and get the award and then
you'll X on the left side now
that's if you're a keynote speaker and
they're paying you a lot of money and
they do expect you to remember that
stuff
I would say that most of the time
at least 90 to 95 percent of the time I
did remember and I would leave the right
direction sometimes I didn't there were
sometimes I went the wrong way
didn't make any difference because you
know I wasn't Biden so it doesn't mean
anything if you're just a normal person
but here's how they could handle Biden
when you hear how easy this is you're
going to think that they must hate him
look how easy this is if you know that
he has this confusion and even if he's
been told in advance he probably still
forgets they just put they all they do
is put handlers on both sides of the
stage
that's it that's the solution and then
whichever way he goes is right
and if he walks the way that they prefer
he doesn't go he walks over to the staff
and he talks to them like it was
intentional then if that's the wrong
direction the staff member says all
right now let's go meet these people
before we leave
and then the two of them casually walk
over to do something else you as the
Observer would never know anything was
wrong because you wouldn't know he
wasn't supposed to go talk to that
person before doing the other thing
it would look natural
so when you see how easy it is to make
that problem completely go away just
have people on both sides and know that
this is the thing
right easy
so what's going on are they incompetent
or do they hate him
it's kind of a mystery
all right uh I want to give you just a
little update because it's funny in a
Dilbert way I had a number of major
problems with my health care provider
recently which I was incapable of
working through on my own
because again the the medication I was
taking from my blood pressure made me
mentally incompetent for a lot of
ordinary
life tasks and
um and I was very aware of that so it
was a little hard to work through
problems when I wasn't in problem
solving mode right it was kind of up to
them to do it on their own and so I said
to them directly you know when I
complained on a couple of different
things I said I have to tell you I'm a
senior I was using that excuse I'm a
senior I need extra help I can't I can't
figure this out on my own and so they
did quite quite reasonably and quite
well trained
they said oh senior and then they went
in a completely different helpful mode
so that part was great I love the fact
that as soon as I announced myself as
not fully capable they they immediately
conformed to that model and gave me all
the time that I needed that was very
good
however
however
what I asked for
no it wasn't the weed because I could be
as I I could beat you on the SATs on any
amount of weed
I promise you that I could probably be
almost all of you in the SATs no matter
how high I was
because that's one thing that happens
when you're a chronic user it doesn't
affect you in the same way right it's a
it's more of a physical thing than a
mental thing
anyway
um
I sounded like Kanye there for a moment
we'll talk about him I call him yay
um so what I was trying to do was just I
turned 65 so I was just signing up for
the senior care version of their health
care which I believed should be
automatic
I believed I should have said oh I'm a
senior now push a button and basically
it just transfers into a new mode and it
cost me less
now wouldn't you think that's the way it
works
but instead it was this we don't even
know how to do it
I was like what this must be the most
normal thing you do when somebody ages
out of your normal program into the 65
and over program these are both year
programs is the most common thing you
probably deal with and you don't know
how to do it and they actually said they
didn't know how to do it and spent you
know hours and you know they had to
delete one and create another and then I
had to check back and I had to make sure
I didn't miss a day and it was all this
amazing confusion and and I kept saying
I don't believe this is your normal
process because how could you even be in
business
and so I I escalated now one of the
things I'd learned long ago in my
corporate world
is that you don't complain to the normal
complaint people
if they can't handle it I mean that's
the first place you go but if they can't
handle it and they tell you that they
can't they won't they won't get their
supervisor which you always get oh no I
I am the one in charge there is no
supervisor there's nobody you can talk
to that's the typical thing you get
these days
then you hang up and you call the the
CEO of the company
now the CEO doesn't answer the phone
although I've heard cases where they did
uh weirdly a friend of mine once called
the CEO of Nordstrom
because he had some complaint or
suggestion and the CEO of Nordstrom took
the call
yeah the secretary answered it but said
yeah we'll probably put you right
through it was just a customer
it was literally just a customer
complaint and the secretary put it put
him right through to the CEO and the CEO
answers the question
[Laughter]
let me tell you Nordstrom got a lot of
free publicity out of that because I've
told that story a thousand times and
that's why they did it Nordstrom
actually had that as a strategy to do
such good customer service that you
would talk about it
it was brilliant really
many of you heard that uh digress for a
moment the famous story um I don't know
if it's true but we heard this in
Business School
might not have been true but there's
some customer who tried to return uh
tires for his car to Nordstrom
and then they they took them in the
return
now that's not the story the story is
that Nordstrom doesn't sell tires
and they took they took some guy's tires
as a return
I gave him a full refund for the tires
that they didn't sell now I don't know
if that was true
but we learned that in business school
because it was a story about Nordstrom
that made you think that oh my God they
really will do above and beyond now if
that was true
which I doubt but if that really
happened
it was good marketing because it
literally became a famous National story
so anyway uh back to Kaiser I told them
I'm pretty sure that you couldn't be in
business if you can't do this simple
thing that you have to do every day it's
your most basic thing
uh then secondly
um I asked if they could tell me the
price
that I'm charged for each of the members
that I'm covering so I had some
dependence on there and I said well how
much does each of these dependents
costing me so I'll know what it would
cost someone else to insure them or you
know I just wanted to know and they said
uh
and I said you don't show that anywhere
I can't find it anywhere I can't ask it
I can't see it online and it's not on
the invoice how much is each person
costing me and so I finally got you know
help from somebody who was the CEO sent
their a team
so when The A Team got involved because
the CEO was probably embarrassed after
my complaints
um
I said to the guy who was going to solve
my complaint I said when you look into
this the part about the pricing I said
you're going to find out something about
the company you work for that you're not
going to like
and he was like what I go I promise you
when you look into the bottom of this
you're going to find out that the reason
that your company doesn't tell me the
price is because they don't want me to
know
and he was like no
no no obviously there's a way to tell
you the price per person of course
wouldn't every one of you think that
that's obvious
and
and how easy would it be for the system
to know that
because the system would know what the
total price would be with and without
that person because that's how they set
the prices
who's in who's out set the price so if
the system could easily say imagine if
this person were not there and then put
a price on them
so we know it's easy
and so I said to him when you look into
this you're going to find out that like
insurance companies like life insurance
and house insurance you will find out
that they won't tell you what's covered
because they don't want you to know
because you could use that information
to shop it around
and he didn't believe it he did not
believe that his company does not give
you a price per person
for the insurance that they sell you
so the other day he called me and said
you know what you said I was going to
find out something I didn't like
he found out he talked to everybody you
could talk to and they confirmed that
their company cannot tell you the price
per person covered
yeah is some kind of weird rule with
that now they had reasons
that didn't sound real
like each department had sort of a
constraint or reason or a pushback but
if you put it all together none of it
made sense the only way any of it makes
sense
is if they don't want you to know the
price
that's the only thing that makes sense
now they give you the total price but I
wanted to know the individual costs
um and then the part about they couldn't
do the basic thing of moving me into the
senior thing
it turns out that this is what they
could have done
instead of the days of work that they
did with me to fix this
what they could have done alternately is
nothing
and it was automatic
exactly like I believe they should have
been
it should have been automatic as soon as
I said I want this all the systems
should have talked to each other move me
from one system onto the other and
that's exactly the way they're designed
after two days of like working and
deleting things and changing things uh
the the official answer came back you
know you could have just waited until
the new program kicked in and the old
one transfers automatically and
and the net of it is I don't even know
if I have health insurance today
literally I don't know because it's
possible that whatever they did to fix
the thing that didn't need fixing
actually broke it
maybe I don't know
so those are the most dilber thing that
happened to me this week
so Ivermectin is trending again and uh
I don't want you to get don't want to
get you all worked up over the question
of whether Ivermectin works
I will just give you this one additional
thought
that is a new thought I hope on top of
what you already thought about
Ivermectin whether it worked or didn't
would you agree
that the tests that showed that
Ivermectin does not work
do not cover the exact protocols that
would be used
if you were a customer
correct how many of you would agree with
that statement that the things that got
tested for Ivermectin were not the
either the combination or the timing or
something about it didn't quite fit what
you imagined it should have been used
for right
now here's the question I'm going to add
on top of that
if all of these tests used it in a
different way and apparently there are
would you agree that there are infinite
ways you could administer it so there
are infinite dose sizes
and you know you can even imagine like
the dose size on day one is different
than the last dose right so that gives
you infinity of ways that you could have
administered it would you agree with
infinity
it's Infinity right because it could
have started small and grown could have
started high and get small it could be a
lot could be a little could start right
away it could start as soon as you have
a sneeze could start as soon as you have
a cough right it's literally Infinity
is it possible that they could have
tested
enough
that you would feel that they hit the
right notes that you would know for sure
whether it worked or not given that the
options for how to administer it were
literally infinite
do you believe that they tested enough
no right right because what would be
let's say they did uh 25 trials
25 tests out of infinity this rounds to
zero right basically it's only as good
as zero almost
but here's the idea I want to put it on
top of this
this is going to you up so bad
this one you need to get ready for
it and this is for the people who are
pretty sure that the problem with
Ivermectin testing
was just the dosage and the scheduling
here it comes
get ready for this one
if there are infinite ways it could have
worked and all of the ways that the
professionals tested that it didn't work
one of the odds that you would have
guessed the right way
what are the odds that you with just oh
I guess I'll listen to this one doctor
and I'll take this dosage
what are the odds that you would have
hit one of the ones out of infinity
remember there are infinite doses you
could have gotten and all the ones that
were tested didn't work
now I know what you're going to say next
you're going to say no they
intentionally set up tests that they
knew couldn't work
so if you intentionally tested all the
ways that couldn't possibly work
well of course you're going to get that
it doesn't work
but do you think that all the people who
are going to take it on their own would
have taken it in a similar dosing
schedule
of course not every person who took it
would have taken it differently
some people would have snorted it in
some people would have rubbed it on
their body some people would have ate it
with apples and some people would have
had it with alcohol some people would
have mixed it with hydroxychlorically
and some people would have uh
you know right there were some people
would have smoked it right some people
would have injected it into their lungs
who knows
but
what are the odds that all of you who
said you used it and it worked you
guessed the right dosage
because this Ivermectin is really
sensitive stuff isn't it it seems like
if you don't use it in exactly the right
way
you get you get exactly zero benefits
which is which would make it a an
interesting kind of a chemical wouldn't
it
can you imagine that other drugs if you
tested them at a sub-optimal dose level
would show no benefit
how common is that
let's say you were testing uh
oh Advil for the first time it never
existed and somebody invented Advil or
Ibuprofen you're testing it for the
first time
if you tested the wrong dose
you'd probably still notice it worked
wouldn't you
am I wrong
and if you did 25 tests with various
doses of ibuprofen
there's like a hundred percent chance
you would notice it worked unless every
dose was so small that
it was negligible
right
so all I'm adding to the conversation
is that while I agree with you that it's
possible that all the people are doing
the tests were corrupted by a big Pharma
that is actually possible completely
possible I I would put that even
in the non-surprising category wouldn't
you say it's not it wouldn't even be
surprising
but we don't know what happened it just
wouldn't be surprising
so all I'm going to add is that I feel
like the signal for uh Ivermectin would
have come through
with all the various ways they tested it
at least one of those
would have shown something working even
accidentally if they were guessing the
dosage schedule
all right I'm going to ignore that
question about my bowels
but it's noted
all right so I'm not going to try to
talk you into or out of ivermectin
um I I will say solidly that both
possibilities are in play
in my opinion it actually is not insane
to think that big Pharma funded all of
fake studies for Ivermectin
will you be happy with me if I say that
that is completely a reasonable
hypothesis
which by the way three years ago I would
have said you're nuts
so I guess that's that's some movement
on my part toward a greater acceptance
of uh conspiracy theories because we've
seen enough conspiracy theories that are
true like totally true
that to say this one couldn't happen
would be naive
that would be naive I can't say it
happened
but the rule of L would just be naive at
this point
all right
um did you see the uh there's a video of
MSNBC uh put together a panel of trump
supporters from Western Pennsylvania
and the MSNBC was asking them about the
January 6th stuff and the the
Insurrection as they call it and you
have to watch this thing because it
turns out that the Trump supporters that
they had randomly chosen uh were all
better informed on the news than the
news person interviewing them and had to
correct her more than once
she believed that they killed a cop and
the the Trump people are like nobody
killed a cop that didn't happen that
didn't happen
and and I think that she sort of ignored
their corrections after a point but
but when you see how well informed that
random group of trump supporters are
they actually do their
didn't they it's fun to say and it's
especially fun to see because of what
you would call a let's say visually
I'm just saying visually there was a
different difference in their education
and sophistication
in other words the reporter
visually I don't know anything about it
but visually look like probably somebody
came from a good college
you know as well put together a
professional really really knows her
stuff and then the The Ordinary People
look like I'll say yokels but I mean
that lovingly because I am one right so
I grew up these were the people I I
lived with and grew up and they would be
like my family so I can call them yokels
if I want to but I mean that lovingly I
mean they're they're ordinary salt of
the earth people right
and they actually just knew more about
the news
than the news person
and you just have to see it it's just a
wonderful moment
all right how many of you saw uh the
interview between Lex Friedman and yay
so this is brand new
and it was interesting because uh Lex is
Jewish and wanted to push pretty hard
on yay is uh recent statements
and uh
I saw a tweet on it that this is not my
opinion this is somebody else's tweet
but it matched my opinion
and this is tweet said I was entirely
prepared to have my attention captivated
by this conversation but after 20
minutes or so yay sounds less like a
Visionary genius and much more like many
fairly Ordinary People I've worked with
who suffer from bipolar disorder
and I wondered did anybody else watch
that interview
and think that they were seeing mental
illness as opposed to genius
I don't know if there are enough people
who saw that
disagree agreed well here's my opinion I
don't I don't exactly agree with this
comment but I you know I resonated with
it here's my take
as somebody who is a creative person
professionally myself
for many many years now
there's one thing I can say with a fair
bit of certainty
that you can't be creative unless you're
crazy
I just don't know that those are
disconnected
I think you have to be crazy
now if you're lucky you have a kind of
crazy that isn't too obvious to other
people
like that's your best case scenario
but if you're yay and you you sort of
live uh live publicly in many ways it's
a little harder to uh
a little higher a little harder to hide
it
but here's the thing
if we say that we're seeing somebody
who's got mental illness and by the way
he said he's off all of his meds
uh which is an interesting thing
because it does make me think that other
people told him that the way he's acting
now
is something that needs to be drugged
away
I don't know if that happened but it
sounds like it did
you think it was yea himself who decided
that he was going to be on whatever
medications he was on or do you think a
doctor decided and he went along with it
or that family members said hey you
better listen to this doctor
I mean it sounds a little like maybe
somebody else thought he should act
differently
or act different
and
and here's the thing
Who Who Are You
or I to judge his mental health
oh what exactly is the standard by which
we compare it
let because normally mental health
normally mental health is based on uh
not exactly objective criteria so much
as whether it affects your life and the
life of other people
right so so mental illness no matter how
many how much of the checklist you hit
is still not really mental illness
unless it's hurting your life
or hurting somebody else's now you could
argue that yay is making people upset
you could argue that he hurt himself by
getting himself canceled
but
you're only watching the third Act
you tell me that you put yea in the
third Act of a movie
and it's not going to go his way
have you been paying attention for his
entire career
I wouldn't bet against them
even if you say he's he's uh totally
crazy he's not more crazy than he ever
was
he didn't suddenly get extra crazy I
don't think I mean maybe he did but I
doubt it
I I feel like this is the exact amount
of crazy that made him 11 billion
dollars according to his his estimate I
heard somebody else say 4 billion I
don't know if any of those estimates are
good especially now that you got
canceled by stuff but he's he's a
billionaire he claims he's the richest
uh
black person in I don't know America or
the world or something so
it's hard to bet against somebody who
has a track record I loved what he said
to uh Pierce Morgan in an interview
earlier
uh
when yay asks Pierce how much money
Pierce had and Pierce you know said
something modest about you was
comfortable and yay said he doesn't take
business advice from people who have
less money than he does
now that's more of a bumper sticker joke
but it's a good one
like it's a good joke because it hits it
hits right where he wanted it to hit
it's right there yeah Michael Jordan
who's who's going to give Michael Jordan
basketball advice
like if you're better than I'm sure but
good luck
so
so the first thing is
um I would say that I do
I do see the bipolar
I would say that anybody who looked at
that and said they could detect mental
illness as it is normally identified in
the normal world I saw it too
doesn't mean I'm right I'm not a I'm not
a professional
you know bipolar spotter
I'm just saying that it just screams out
mental illness
but illness again
is a is a bigoted word isn't it
mental illness is a bigoted word
I should say mental um
mentally different
how about that
he's mentally diverse how about that
mentally diverse I mean these are these
are the most diverse mind that we
that we have in America he might be the
most diverse thinker we have because he
can say White lives matter he can say
he's fighting for black people
he can say anything he's got the whole
spectrum and nobody else has that
so if mental illness allowed him to be
the only person in the world who can see
everything
that's a weird mental illness
it made him a billionaire who can see
the entire field
so you can see what white people are
thinking you can see what black people
are thinking
and he may be on the verge of learning
what Jewish people are thinking but not
there yet
[Laughter]
definitely not there yet unless he's
doing it as you know a provocation
intentionally which he might be he might
be intentionally provoking
uh just for a fact
um
I'll give you another uh factoid
that may or may not be influencing yea's
Behavior lately he told the story on his
interview with Lex that at one point he
got a phone call that he didn't
recognize the number and it was Pete
Davison
telling them that P Davison was at that
moment in bed with yay's wife who I take
it he's still in love with and wants to
get back with based on what he said at
the interview
now imagine being yay
you've got two or three kids with Kim
Kardashian and he says that she was like
the real love
like he's clearly still in love with Kim
Kardashian oh yeah he's not hiding that
at all and he clearly would like to be
back with her and with his family
and Pete Davidson called him from in bed
with his wife
now if that really happened
Pete Davidson is a real piece of
now I don't know if it happened
but if that's true
oh my god
now I don't know what you know yay may
have done to Pete Davidson to make him
think that that was that was an
appropriate move you have to hear both
sides
but it's horrifying
somebody says Angela says it didn't
happen maybe maybe
who knows
yeah it does sound a little uh too
horrifying to be true but we don't
really have a record of yay lying to us
do we
I can't think of one
has yea ever told like a direct like a
factual lie
is there any history of that
it's an Andrew taboo
yeah kinda
all right anyway
um
so I'm going to say that there's no
difference between gays alleged bipolar
what you would call mental illness and
what I would call
um
creative genius
but did you see creative genius in The
Lex Friedman interview
um
it was kind of a mixed bag
there were moments that I could
certainly think look like genius and
there are other moments that look like
something else
but again
he's the billionaire
I'm not I'm not a billionaire
so can I really judge anything he did
as wrong now apparently Adidas has
dropped him
which some have suggested that that was
his plan his plan was to get full
control back of all of his assets once
once he had built them into a valuable
thing
if he gets it back and he starts his own
business and people buy from him
he will be much richer than if he worked
you know worked with balenciago and
and Adidas and he said a funny thing
that you could only be mentally ill and
a genius to say
he said of Balenciaga who stopped their
their thing he goes in X number of years
I forget what he said uh what will be
the bigger thing
Yeezy or balenciago in five years are
you going to be talking about Balenciaga
or Yeezy and I thought to myself
oh yeah he's right about that
Balenciaga was the one that lost because
he's more famous than they are in terms
of you know the General Public
I already know who they were I never
heard of them before I guess some
fashion house or clothing maker or
something I don't know
who knows but um
it must be said that the the major theme
there was Lex trying to get yay to admit
or understand and here's the part we
don't know
we don't know what yay is thinking
we can only know what he says
and Yea acted almost as if he didn't
understand which is the part I bet I
doubt
he acted like he wasn't getting the
point that talking about Jewish people
as a group
when he's criticizing
it can lead you to the worst possible
outcome
and he kept saying but it's true
he kept saying that the the majority of
the people who caused me problems happen
to be Jewish so he says why can't I say
that if it's just true and Lex is trying
to explain that's not the point the
point is now whether it's true
the point is you're making a statement
about all Jews when really they were
just individuals who were your problem
and I'm sure he understands that
because anybody would
but he he would he refused to sort of
acknowledge it like to speak it back or
or to debate it directly he was always
sort of like a little off the left and
and Lex to his credit went really hard
at him
like I I don't know if I've ever seen
anybody go harder at somebody
in an interview
so Lex
props you went really hard now the
problem was apparently they're friends
I didn't know that but apparently Lex
and yeah you've known each other and
their friends
and
um I think that the maybe the
you know the friendship or even the
celebrity part
it tends to distort things but it was
fascinating to watch Lex
in my opinion quite legitimately
bothered by what yea said and quite
legitimately bothered that yea wouldn't
admit that what he had done could have
some negative consequences
and yet he kept you know joking and kept
like the Friendship up
and I
I guess I went away feeling a little uh
sort of thinking about it for a long
time and I said to myself did I just see
the best thing I ever saw
which is two people really going at each
other hard and remaining friends
because they did
they they went hard and
they kept they stayed friends
or no that would be the best case
scenario right or did I see somebody who
was an anti-semite refused to
you know fess up
I feel like it was
both
I mean
and and let me say something that uh
I wonder if this will get me canceled
well let's see let's see let's see if I
get canceled all right
um I am very anti-racism
I do not like racists
and I disavow them wherever I see them
so just that's my starting point right
zero I have zero
flexibility on that
except there is one exception
there is one person who in my opinion at
least was I don't know if he still is
but was at one point a huge racist
and that person
I allowed
I allowed it and here's why
because he had been uh beaten up and
mugged repeatedly through his youth by
black students black people his age
usually and mugged on the streets and
100 of the crime against him had been by
black people
literally mugged multiple times by black
people literally bullied every day at
school literally smacked around every
day of school by black people
now when I heard his story this is
something I went to school with when I
heard his story and then I saw that he
was a racist I said to myself okay
I'm going to give you that
not because I believe what he believes
you know that all black people are going
to beat him up or something I don't
believe that
but I believe he earned it
he earned it like he's one person who
can say
whatever he wants about the people who
beat him up and I'm gonna say okay
okay
likewise let's say you've been captured
by
you know some Islamic terrorists and
they tortured you for a year
when you got out if you told me that you
were prejudiced or bigoted against that
group
would I say no you bigot you racist nope
no I would say okay you earned that you
get to say that
you you alone get to say that and if
somebody else gets tortured they get to
say too because
that wasn't caused by you you know
whoever tortured you caused you to be
that way and they get to own that a
little bit
so I give people a pass if they have
been absolutely uh well I'll give you
another one
you remember when the Japanese Americans
were rounded up and put in concentration
camps during World War II for doing
nothing except existing and being good
Americans
do you if the people who got out of that
had a bad feeling about white Americans
would you begrudge that
I wouldn't no they they earned it they
earned it they get to say white people
are
they can say that to my face
they can say that right to me and I'll
say um you know I I will acknowledge
that opinion
yep so likewise if my college friend
said bad things about black people I
would say only you can say that because
you've been so abused so regularly by
exclusively black people had to do with
where he lived
um so yeah you could be a racist I'm
gonna let you have that
likewise if you were a George Floyd's
family
and you started hating white people
because of what happened to George Floyd
I'm going to give you that
I'm going to give you that now I would
love
to see anybody rise above it
wouldn't that be inspirational to see
somebody say yes
I earned this bigoted feeling but I can
rise above it that would be great and I
would give you extra credit for that
but if you don't feel like it and you
don't want to
I'm fine with that in general we should
all avoid that
but
now yea tells the story of being
continuously abused by one group of
people
I I don't I don't know how to fact check
that
I would be surprised if if 95 of his
problems were from one group I suppose
it's 70 percent
um
yeah
so to me it looks like bigotry to me it
looks like a very bad idea what he's
doing I don't like the messaging at all
um I don't disagree with him not
apologizing
because I think that's in 2022 not
apologizing is a reasonable strategy for
some people
not everybody
but you know I wouldn't say that's
always wrong but you do have to clarify
you do need to clarify and I I think
he's intentionally avoiding
clarification because he sort of does
want us to think that he has an attitude
about the Jewish business people he has
been working with
and
I would say if it's true and this is the
fact check I don't know but if it's true
that he has been unusually victimized by
one group
well I would personally say I wish we
would not treat any group poorly and I
don't think it's a representative of the
group
I would say I'll let him have that
I'm going to let him have it
same way as if yay had been beaten up
every day by albonians for a year
even if I think albonians are peaceful
people
I would say okay yay can be bigoted
against albonians because they beat them
up every day for a year I'll be okay
with that
yeah here's here's a dick who's giving
us uh a quote if you want to know who
controls you find find out who you're
not allowed to criticize
well you're not you're not allowed to
criticize any group
you're not allowed to criticize any
group
that is there any group you can create
well white people white males
I guess you'd do this like white men
still
um
can you believe that the GOP is so bad
at dirty tricks that they have not yet
hired actors to dress up as Nazis and
attend all Democrat
meetings and rallies
now you say to yourself but Scott
it would be obvious immediately that it
was a dirty trick
yeah
no problem do it anyway
and not only should you do it but every
single person every one of the actors
should wear a little fake Hitler
mustache
and like actually we're like SS outfits
like just just go to the point where
it's obvious
it's obvious it's a dirty trick you want
all the Republicans to laugh when they
say it they go oh that's obviously our
guys
and then make them run it on the news
over and over again and you know what
the news would do
the news would run it as a hoax they'd
say well look at these people trying
this trick again look at this trick
they're trying we know these are just
Republicans dressing up as Hitler and
attending uh Democrat things but here's
the problem
people are visual
if you show enough Democrat rallies with
people wearing Hitler outfits it doesn't
matter how many times you say it's a
joke people will remember Hitler and
Democrats associated
so I'm just surprised they haven't tried
that I suppose you get killed if you
dressed as a Nazi and went to a Democrat
rally so maybe the fact that you would
get killed
could be the limitation
um
Democrats plan to steal the next
election which I didn't know until
Hillary Clinton told us directly now if
you've been watching lately you know
that the way the Democrats work is if
they're planning to uh
rob a bank
that will start by phase one
blame the Republicans of robbing that
bank
or planning to rob the bank so that when
they do rob the bank they've already
primed you that it's the Republicans
they're the bank robbers we told you
these Republicans we're going to rob
that bank and sure enough the money's
gone from the bank who else could it be
but also
so so here's what she says there's
Hillary Clinton said right-wing
extremists she did a video of this
right-wing extremists already have a
plan to literally steal the next
presidential election
literally steal it
do you know what she means by that
means working hard to elect
the right people in the local areas
Republicans and that those Republicans
would do Republican things and change
the rules and the way that would steal
the election according to Hillary well
now that we know their playbook the fact
that she's warning this directly in
advance tells you that the Democrats are
definitely planning to steal the
election
and she is trying to make you think that
Republicans are election Stealers so
they won't be so obvious when they do it
now you all know the play now right
it used to be I thought this was a
coincidence
like oh that's a coincidence it feels
like they did the same thing that they
accuse somebody that's probably just a
coincidence no it's not a coincidence
this is a plan they're they're they're
broadcasting this as clearly as you
could they are broadcasting that the
Democrats plan to cheat and they plan to
you know
uh they plan to
brand the Republicans as election
deniers or election cheats or whatever
if they lose if they win everything will
be fine
it's funny that we can see this coming
and it doesn't make any difference it's
just going to come anyway
um so that same video I was talking
about where she she talked about this uh
upcoming election stealing
it took all of less than one day and
probably just a few hours where somebody
took that video the real video of
Clinton talking and must have run it
through some kind of an AI engine and
changed it to it's still Hillary Clinton
talking except her face has extreme
sadness
she looks like she was about ready to
cry
but she still says the same words and
it's still her and it looks exactly like
her because it is her it's just the only
thing they changed was her facial
expression a little bit so that she
looks like a
uh instead of uh
her usual angry stern look and
do you know how much problems that's
going to be I mean it's enough of a
problem that you can create a whole
person
who doesn't exist and have them say
stuff but at the moment we can still
detect that
this change of her facial expression
I think you could make that undetectable
because they they did us a favor and
they went far enough with the change
that you could detect it like you could
pick it up right away but suppose you
had done 20 of that change
20 of it would look or make her look
sort of monstrous
and it would make the message that she
said just sound all wrong because of the
Monstrous look and I don't know that you
would be able to detect it you could you
could just tweak her 20 and make a happy
expression look like an evil smile
like it's so easy to just tweak it a
little bit and I think that's really
something to be afraid of
because that's this next cycle that I'm
not talking like next year this is
something you could do right now so you
can take anybody's speech and make them
just 20 percent more unhappy evil
negative huge difference to how people
will perceive that
I don't know what we're going to do
about that we probably need some laws
uh
yeah always need more laws
I saw Rich Barris
well known as the people is pundit on
Twitter
and
he notes that there's a Democrat
operative on CNN who is citing a CNN
poll
um
that uh that the elections are going to
be really close
right so most of the polls show there
should be some kind of a red wave
but how could you cheat
if all of the polls if all of the polls
said Republicans are going to win
everything and then they don't
you can't really it's hard to cheat in
those situations
so what they need is at least one poll
that says it was close all along and
then when they cheat hypothetically
then the actual result will be so close
to the fake poll they'll say well this
is totally expected this poll said this
would be the outcome there's the outcome
obviously the other polls are biased
this was the good poll so CNN got it
right and everybody got it wrong
and Rich Barris is is warning us that
it's sort of obvious that they're
setting this up they're setting up the
fake polls so that they have an out when
they cheat
do you believe that
or is that too far
is that a little too far
not in 2022
again three years ago I always said no
that's a little too far that's a little
conspiracy theory you know I'm not sure
I would go that far
now I don't know if it's true
but they would definitely go that far
that question is asked and answered yes
they would definitely do this
intentionally right in front of you
I don't know if they are
sure it looks like it
all right I've told you before one of my
best persuasion tips is the best graphic
wins right uh I would argue that climate
change the entire topic of it is hugely
influenced by the hockey stick graph
because it was simple to understand and
after a while everybody saw it
so whoever has the let's say the
champion graphic ends up owning the
conversation
so if you can find a situation that does
not yet have a Graphic and you can
provide it well then you own the
situation
and there's a graphic that's missing
from the election process that is so
obvious now I used to do this for a
living which was draw pictures on
PowerPoint that you know showed a system
or clearly showed a complicated thing in
its simplest form and I can tell you
that if I worked on
you know closer to this stuff what I
would have done is I would have created
an infographic in other words a picture
that showed in boxes each of the steps
of the election so box number one would
be voter you know pulls a lever
in the voting booth
and then that box would say it would
have a a little note on it about whether
that could be audited
now I'm not sure you need it
but could you tell for example that the
lever pulled is the same as the vote
count for that machine is that auditable
if it is say yes auditable and instantly
maybe then what's the next step what
happens to the vote once it's in the
machine
and there's or where there's a physical
ballot like what it what is the steps
who hands it to whom
what machine does it go into
and then after the machine where does it
go
and then how does that data get from
that machine to the you know big data in
the sky
now if you drew a picture of all those
steps you could label each step as to
whether or not it could be
um audited
and whether it could be instantly
audited or might be like weeks
wouldn't you like to know to see the
picture of all the election steps and to
have let's say a color coded green for
all the ones that you can audit easily
and then red for any area in which we
don't want it or couldn't
would it all be great
because Democrats would say well there's
no point in that it's all greed
would it be
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think it would all be green
whoever could produce that picture and
there would be a different picture for
each state right because states do it
differently some have paper ballots some
well I don't know but there's some
difference some use machines some don't
so so you should have one of these for
each of the Battleground States
and that picture should be very clearly
this we can be sure of this we could be
sure of this is invisible to us if
anything bad happened in this little box
there isn't any way to know
would you like to see that
it would change my whole opinion of 2020
if somebody credible put that together
and it was all green
you said yeah well actually every part
of this is auditable and we did in fact
audit every part of this and all those
places that looked weird it was just
because it was a like pandemic rule
changes but nothing illegal you know it
was just stuff that was unusual but not
illegal
so
so think about this how hard would it be
for somebody who knew that information
to create that picture
and I think the answer is if you were a
person who knew how the things work you
could probably do that pretty easily
10 minutes maybe 10 minutes on the back
of a napkin and yet we haven't seen one
have you have you ever seen any news
report anywhere
Print TV internet that shows you a
picture of the process
and that which parts are auditable
now is that not the most useful thing
that you could have
what would be more useful than that
for a country that can't decide if our
elections are even fair
nothing
now somebody's saying is genius but no
that's the opposite of what's Happening
Here if you think that's a brilliant
idea
let me
let me add some humility it's not
brilliant it's exactly what every person
in Corporate America would have done
If This Were my job if I were in charge
of this and it was just like within a
corporation my my CEO would fire me if I
didn't produce that picture
right anybody who's worked in the big
company and let's say there were all
kinds of questions about parts of the
process if you couldn't produce that
picture and put it on one slide for the
CEO your ass is fired
it's the most obvious basic ordinary
thing you would do you would make that
picture
and you would find out where the
problems are and then you'd deal with
those problems
but the fact that the government doesn't
do it is not because I'm a genius and
they're not
I'd love you to believe that the reason
the government's not doing it is
they don't want you to know
they don't want you to know
what else could it be
because they definitely know how to do
it and there are certainly enough you
know ex-corporate people who would know
that that's the basic thing you do the
most basic thing you do
right they know that not every person
has corporate experience but enough of
them that somebody would have done it
even if the boss didn't tell them to
there should be somebody who knows
something about these systems even the
junior member who could just draw the
picture and then tweet it
once it's on Twitter we'll make sure see
people see it
so if if you know how to do that
if you know anybody who knows how to do
it draw me a picture color code it and
we'll argue about it because people say
oh you got that one wrong or you should
add a box or whatever but let's let's
fight it out put it on a put it on one
page
for for let's just say one area because
it'd be different for each area just do
one area and we'll take a look at it
okay
uh how many had your mind blown
by realizing that that's the most
obvious thing and nobody's doing it
it's kind of mind-blowing isn't it
if you don't think of it you don't
notice it because it because it's the
dog now barking situation you don't
notice why isn't there as easily as what
is there yeah once you realize how easy
it would be to inform the country of
what the real situation is what's our
real risk with these elections once you
know how easy it would be you have to
know it's intentional that they don't
tell you and it must be intentional on
both Republican and Democrat sides which
means that they both expect
some Advantage from cheating
I don't know how else you could
well let me say that more directly I
assume both Democrats and Republicans
are hoping to cheat
I don't know that
but I think that both sides believe that
their own side chains and that both
sides would be happy if their own side
cheated successfully
yeah not every person right we're all
different but they're probably plenty of
people who would fall into that category
all right so best graphic wins is some
of the strongest persuasion advice you
will ever hear in your life have you
seen how my 16 uh
hoaxes on my hoax quiz most of you have
seen that so I created a little graphic
of just bullet points 16 bullet points
of known hoaxes
now have you seen how how effectively
that shuts down a conversation on
Twitter has anybody noticed it like you
you stick that thing into a conversation
on Twitter and the Democrats just run
away or or worse they argue the ones
that are obviously hoaxes are real and
that's fun too because you know that
when they're arguing oh that number five
is real
they've already you've already uh
well I don't know if you understood the
the Brilliance of this
but by making it 16 things
people will tend to say
four of those are definitely true
which means what
that they agreed 12 of them were fake
that's why you want it so you don't care
that they argue a few of them are true
incorrectly they'd be wrong about that
but they they have to come away from
that process thinking oh shoot I'm on
the team that created at least 12 hoaxes
that even I agree are hoaxes but those
four
I still think those four are real
they're not
so so there's my example
did you notice how effective it was now
even though that's just words the fact
that I put it as a graphic and not text
so you can just you know paste it in
it totally worked right you can see the
power of the graphic Whoever has the
best graphic wins
and that will be true
through this next election
yeah if if the Trump team had a graphics
person
who could create not just memes remember
memes are good because they're Visual
and they they work on your emotional
parts and but mostly the the memes are
mostly to make you join a team and like
get a laugh with your team memes don't
really persuade people but a good
graphic could
you know that the hockey stick graph
absolutely persuaded people and probably
nothing else probably just that little
picture of a hockey stick you know
alleged shape for temperature change
that's probably all it took
for a billion people to believe in
climate change a little a little
squiggly line that's it
so
if you want to say to yourself can one
person change anything this is the best
example
the the way one person can change the
world is was one well designed
graphic
that you absolutely can change the world
with one graphic
whether that's true or not is different
uh
oh Trump started the kids in cages well
yeah
that was kind of a weird hoax because
even the Democrats know that Obama had
kids in the cages too
I feel like that's one where they just
sort of don't care
as opposed to actually believing it
you know because I think Democrats
believe that Obama did it too
it's just a question of extent and
whether they care about that
poll Watcher CPA several control
gaps almost unaudible all right here's
somebody who's uh identifying themselves
as a poll Watcher and a CPA right so if
you're a CPA you know how systems and
controls and auditing works that's like
built into the job
and this one says as a poll Watcher so
somebody who actually knows the system
and knows how to audit systems says
several control gaps almost unauditable
Now by control gaps I think that means
that the handoffs are not
you know monitored right I think that's
what that means
or it could be that people have access
to change things uh without proper
controls that's possible too could be a
variety of things
you've met a Democrat who didn't know
about built the cages but when you told
them they probably believed it
so that's what's different about that
um
that hoax
is that when you inform people they go
oh they sort of accept it
they just think that it's worse under
Trump
which I think it was right
of course it's intentional it's
Elementary
they had to Google it on the spot and
and once it was Googled on the spot they
accepted it right
once they saw that Google agreed with
you
I think they accepted it and then just
changed the argument to something else
here's an interesting uh point of view
there's some people on YouTube are
having that uh
there's some things are inflammatory
should be discussed speaking of EA
that just because what yay says is
um
the the sub-optimal way to put it
that doesn't mean it's not worth talking
about but what would you talk about
see his claim he does not
it's weird because he's being criticized
for a claim he's not making
he he's he's treating it as though the
Jews are one thing but when you ask him
about it he says directly I'm talking
about individuals
and then as Lex continually tried to say
well if you're talking about individuals
please say it that way
say the individuals stop saying as Jews
and and Kanye will keep saying it's Jews
to use his words because they are
[Laughter]
but at the same time he's now saying all
Jews are bad or doing anything he's just
saying all of the ones that were most
are the ones that were his problem were
coincidentally Jewish
so so it's interesting because the thing
he's being criticized for saying he says
directly he's not saying
and nobody else gets to overrule that
right he gets to say what he's saying
but Lex's point stands which is it it
leads you
too easily into demonizing a group and I
do believe that the people who hear yay
talking are not necessarily interpreting
as individuals
don't you think that the people
listening to yay are interpreting it as
Jews
a lot of them not everybody right I like
I don't hear it that way but don't you
think a lot of people are hearing it as
Jews because they want to they're
already biased against that group
yeah
Scott my reply was an analogy which you
love about Trump being inflammatory
oh the the uh I love when Trump is
inflammatory
but I definitely hated it when he talked
about the criminals coming across the
border
it might have worked because it
activated his base so worked in the
sense of getting elected but I don't
like it and I think that's his single
biggest
um mistake
it was arguably not a mistake to say it
the first time
because then he could just clarify I'm
not saying everybody's a criminal I'm
just saying that they're sending some
criminals
and too many of them so he could have
corrected that so easily but he chooses
not to I think that was a mistake now I
don't I don't think he deserved an
apology
I don't think he had to give an apology
because he's anti-apology and once we
all understand that
it's easy to process that is just the
way he is
but I think he needed a clarification
clarification was yeah he wasn't lying
but he wasn't clear
and clarification is never wrong you
know the President should be able to
clarify something like that
uh
I've heard Trump say he wasn't talking
about all
yeah but he still says it that way
even since he said I didn't hear that
but assuming that he said that that he
wasn't talking about all of them he has
still gone back to his old messaging of
saying quote they're not sending their
best
so unfortunately it sounds different
from how he wants you to hear it
so it sounds like a dog whistle
perhaps we always say black in group
context while we do not
with Jewish
I don't quite understand that
somebody's saying they're going to call
yay Kanye because that's what his mother
named him well that's not how it works
yeah your mother only gets the first the
first draft
uh
he had dead naming
all right
uh why do we not assume yay is a bit
simple
because he's not
like whatever you want to say about him
there is there is some real capability
there
you know I I think the genius is an
appropriate
descriptor for yay
that where you get in trouble is
imagining it's all genius
because nobody does that like Mark Twain
really good
you know Albert Einstein really smart
but you don't think they did some dumb
things in their normal life probably
all right
uh yay did say that he believed he was
uh one of the top five writers in the
world of the country
what do you make of that claim
one of the top five writers
well remember he writes his songs and
his songs are
you know insanely well written in my
opinion and obviously commercially
successful
makes you wonder who we thought the
others were he also said something about
30 percent of the English language comes
from Shakespeare
um
I don't think so
did you hear that part somebody said 30
he said 30 of the English language
was influenced by Shakespeare
that could possibly be true
could it
I've never heard that
it might be something like there's
references back to it
but
but Shakespeare wasn't making up words
he I think he was using words that
already existed
maybe he was talking about the plots
yeah maybe I don't know so I'm not sure
exactly what he meant by that but I
didn't I didn't buy that point
well
is is kind of is yay in the top five of
writers
let me give you a little writer's Secret
do you know who writers think are in the
top five of writers
what what do you think the top writers
think are in the top five of writers
well it starts with themselves
and then four other people who don't
matter
four people named randomly well first
there's me let's start with me and I'll
throw in some other people yeah JK
Rowling she's okay too Shakespeare so
it's pretty much uh yay Mei Shakespeare
JK Rowling and uh Mark Twain Mark Twain
it's really the five of us occupying
that space
that's every writer talking right there
all right I think I've done enough
have I done my duty today
and of course Joshua
top five
what about Bill Burr top five writer oh
you know maybe you don't think of
stand-up comedians as writers
but you think of Chappelle or you think
of Bill Burr and it's you know the
performance is what you see but the
writing is Sensational I was just
listening to another Bill Burr you know
a little tidbit just this morning I
remember thinking to myself God it's the
writing
the writing is insane it's so good
all right
that's all for now
and
go have a wonderful day because you
deserve it damn it you deserve it go
have a great day
