to
do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
although things might get a little
brutal a little bit later on this live
stream
got a little problem with my printer
you may have heard what happened to the
last printer
the last printer was destroyed on the
floor of my office for non-performance
but I've replaced it with a brand new HP
Laser Printer
which has no option for finding Wi-Fi
that I can determine
so I'll probably
decide by the end of this live stream
whether I should destroy it on my floor
For Your Entertainment
I think 500 is not too expensive to to
entertain you but if you'd like to take
this experience up to another level all
you need is a cup of mugger glass
attacker tells us to Heineken teen Joker
flask of vessel levitic eye and fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines of the day
thing that makes everything better it's
cold the simultaneous sip and it happens
now go
now I'd like to speak to the Boomers out
there
Boomers I know we get a uh
bad reputation for not being able to
handle technology very well
and you know maybe maybe that's deserved
maybe it is
as possible but the other possibility is
that we're busy
and there's a category of problems that
I find I can't solve and I want to see
if anybody has the same problem
if I have a big problem
I will dedicate a lot of time to solving
it and then I do
so I find that I can solve my big
problems
quite efficiently
if I have a small problem
that I can fix in maybe a minute
or five minutes I'm really good at
fixing those if it's a five minute
problem I'm on it if it's a big
multi-day or even multi-week problem Oh
I can solve that but there's a category
of problem that I can't solve
and
I think I'll be the first person to call
this out as a civilization problem
this is a really really big problem
and it goes like this
I have a number of small problems
they're small problems but they might
take more than an hour to fix
for example
I had some credit card problems with
lost credit card
so everything that's connected to my
credit card starts throwing up and then
I have to go add the new credit card
so I had so I had a subscription to the
Hulu service and it told me oh your
credit cards go on so you can't keep
watching
so I said to myself well I'm a boomer
but one thing I can do is add a new
credit card to an app I mean how hard is
that right that's pretty simple so I
open the app
and the app says oh not here you don't
add that credit card in the app go to
our website
so I go to the website now now I'm
approaching five minutes in do you see
the problem
because I'm starting to hit my five
minute limit and I'm not going to be
anywhere near
getting ready so I go to the website and
I'm thinking well if it's just a website
and I just put in my email
should be fine should be five minutes
and the website says you use iTunes
what so I go to the app to the website
to iTunes and I don't have iTunes on my
computer
so am I going to download iTunes and the
reason I don't have it is because it's
an enormous problem
I mean I don't want it on my computer
and if I put it on there would I really
be able to figure out within the iTunes
how to update my credit card because I
don't even know what that has to do with
my credit card and Hulu what the hell
does iTunes have to do with Hulu
so what do I do
I've made the decision to never watch
Hulu for the rest of my life
now I'm not blaming Hulu I'm not blaming
myself I'm just saying that
if it's a small problem because watching
Hulu doesn't change my life right I can
watch something else
so Hulu can never be solved because I
will never put an hour of time into it
and if I did I could totally solve it
totally now if I were 25 what would I do
in this situation
because I was 25 I know what I would
have done what would you do if you're
25. you'd spend an hour
right you spend an hour because you have
an hour and you really want to watch
Hulu and you don't have much else going
on
so I'd spend an hour not fix it
I'm not sure this has to do with being a
boomer
I think it has to do with what I think
my time is worth and I'm not going to
spend an hour
so I can watch more Hulu so the other
day I noticed I started getting ads on
YouTube which you don't get if you've
paid for that what's it called Redtube
or something if you paid for the
subscription on YouTube you don't need
ads but the same credit card problem
took down my red tube so I started
getting ads now I'm unwilling to watch
any service with ads
I don't I don't watch Network TV with
ads I won't watch anything with ads
so I say to myself well I'm gonna have
to go put in my credit card
I cannot figure out where in the world I
would update my credit card
it might be on my phone is it an Apple
credit card that somehow interacted with
YouTube is it somehow connected to Gmail
and chrome because it's all Google
it's not on my app
so I spent
I spent five minutes
spent five minutes looking for how to
update my credit card I couldn't find it
in five minutes
or not Redtube I guess redtube's porn
isn't it
what's the name of the YouTube service
where you don't pay Where You Don't See
subscriptions
all right YouTube What premium YouTube
premium all right whatever it is
um I think that was too much information
so now my current decision is to never
watch YouTube again or to spend an hour
trying to unfuck that
I think I'm never going to watch YouTube
again
why is it so hard to figure out where my
credit card is when I'm trying to update
it
now take my printer
I got this new HP Laser Printer because
I destroyed my other one on the floor
for being defective
and
the laser printer comes up and the only
thing it says for setup is go to your
computer and use the HP software that
you download
so I go to my computer and it says
find it find your printer on the network
but there was nothing to ever put the
printer on the network
so I only have one interface and the
interface doesn't say anything about
a network
all it says is it should be on the
network
but no way to do it there's no separate
menu there's no settings at least I
can't find it now if I spend an hour
could I make my printer work
what do you think
if I spend one hour
I think I could
you think I will spend one hour or do
you think I will spend five minutes
destroying it on my floor in front of
you
and then order a different model that
might work the first time
because if I order a new one
you know my my time is fairly valuable
so if I just destroy the HP
for not having a user interface that
it works for me
and I just buy another one the new one
will come and I might be able to set it
up in five minutes
so what do I do
what would you do
now reach somebody says return it
I I basically don't return anything
because I'm not going to spend the extra
time
so do I destroy her For Your
Entertainment
or do I uh where did I spend an hour
trying to fix it
all right well think about that while we
talk about the rest of this uh I saw
Michael Schellenberg tweeting that uh
uh somebody's figure down to that Navy
divers the U.S Navy diverse blew up that
nordstream pipeline
that people were wondering who blew it
up remember the United States blamed
Russia for blowing up their own pipeline
well
is there anybody who can admit being
embarrassed forever or ever imagining
that Russia blew up its own pipeline
is there anybody who would be willing to
say okay I'm embarrassed I ever thought
that
you should have been embarrassed if you
ever thought that Russia blew up its own
pipeline
there's not there's not a chance in the
world that that happened now I'm not
sure I believe this story
you know I don't know how anybody knows
that there was a mid-summer NATO
exercise and navy divers surreptitiously
planted these explosives months in
advance
Maybe
possibly
but who knows so I don't believe
anything that's um yeah
got sources like that
um
the President Biden spokesperson
Karina Jean-Pierre
um I I love Greg gutfeld's new name for
her
cringe Jean-Pierre
cringe yes she's hard to watch without
cringing and
here's what I find uh interesting about
watching her there's there's yet another
clip of Kareem Jean-Pierre trying to
speak in public and it just goes all
wrong
and I thought to myself there's a lot of
people in that room
do you think there was even one other
person in that whole room of reporters
and other politicians or whoever's there
I don't know other staffers do you think
there was even one person in that room
who would not be able to form a sentence
the only person in the room who couldn't
form a coherent sentence
was the spokesperson for the United
States president
I work kind of okay with that
what would it take what would it take to
get fired
it seems like it seems like there's
nothing that's bad enough
for the Democrats to admit all right all
right maybe we ought to make a change
here
I mean we we literally
without any hyperbole have found the
least capable Communicator in the entire
country and put her in charge of
communicating from the president who is
the second least good the second worst
Commuter Carrier in the world
I mean how did we get to this point
where the president and the spokesperson
to the president can't speak
um well anyway here we are
um
so Chef do you follow Chef Andrew gruel
on Twitter
he's a well-known Chef whose last name
is gruel
g-r-u-e-l
that's like the dentist who's Dr Chu
and the baker whose name is Baker
but Chef gruel
he reports that there's lots of
automation happening in restaurants now
so there's a Korean barbecue joint that
uses robots to deliver food
what do you think of that robots to
deliver your food well I plan to open
someday a Dilbert Diner where
uh it's it's a restaurant for lonely
introverts
so instead of two tops and Four Tops the
normal tables you just have one tops
everything's just for you and your
laptop
just just a one chair a table and a
place to plug into your laptop
and uh you'd order on your app and the
robot would bring it to you and you
wouldn't have to deal with any humans
whatsoever
the Dilbert Diner who would go oh and
also the kitchen would be um primarily
robots
mostly a a big robot that makes
everything
you would go to that yeah and uh Chef
gruel reports that the robot
Robot Restaurant is packed so people
love it now at some point it would you
know no longer be a novelty so it's not
going to work that way but
I think the Dilbert Diner is just
begging to be made
what do you think all right Elon Musk
has teased
that he's going to be introducing
sometime real soon Master Plan Three the
path to a fully sustainable energy
future for Earth
will be presented on March 1st to this
and he says the future is Bright Now
I could not be more interested than this
all right here's what I want because you
probably know that there are a number of
people Alex Epstein being among them
who say that the
um
sort of all electric world just can't
work like the math can't work
but Elon Musk says account
Elon Musk says again
so don't you want to see that that
conversation take place in public
wouldn't you like to see Elon Musk
defend
his opinion that we can get there with
batteries and solar panels and maybe
some windmills and eventually get rid of
our carbon stuff wouldn't you love to
see that conversation because here's my
problem
I don't actually know who's right
I guess that's always my problem but I'm
not sure it is possible
but I'm also not sure it's impossible
it feels like it's within the realm of
something we could get to but maybe we
don't know how yet
so there might be difference in
Assumption of whether we can innovate
our way to you know a better efficiency
and maybe that's the only difference
yeah it could it could come down to the
only yes I think Elon Musk is
pro-nuclear as well so let's throw in
nuclear
all right a weird thing happened to me
as I was flipping through channels last
night looking for reactions to the State
of the Union which we'll talk about
and I came across the
The Young Turks with a jenk
and here's what I was expecting
I was expecting wow that Biden is
killing it he's so good Donald Trump uh
was a horrible person and aren't we glad
that Trump is gone and Biden said
and instead it was closer to the
opposite
and I didn't watch much of it but the
the brief part I saw
appeared to be Jank Winger oiger
I have to apologize to him publicly for
you know not being able to say his name
correctly that's on me so
it looked like
Jake
was
turning pro-trump
and it looked like somebody waking up
and I'm wondering if anybody's noticed
it
now he didn't go so far as to say I like
Trump he was better than Biden I mean
that's way farther than he went but it
looked like
it looked like the spell was breaking
and I watched it with Fascination
because he was saying things that were
just sort of objectively true
without any spin
and the objectively true stuff was not
leading him to his old opinions
objectively true was sort of leading him
into the promised land of actually
understanding what's going on here
I don't know that just give it a look
and get back to me okay just look at his
let's just anything look at his
um reaction to the state of the union
and get back to me and tell me he sees
it right
like he sees that Biden's not quite all
there I think he does
I think he does so if something
interesting might be happening there
all right here's some more info on the
Biden crime family I'm going to call him
that from now on because I
um normally I would not
accuse people of crimes unless I was
sure that they were really crimes
but I'm sure there were really crimes
part of the
part of that is because the Marco Polo
report
has a 630 page Report with over 2 000
citations
uh and 459 alleged crimes committed by
the Biden family and their business
associates and that that report has been
sent to the house of the Senate and the
U.S attorneys
459 crimes were identified I think
mostly from the the laptops or the
laptop
now
obviously
459 crimes
is I assume it's stuff like
he smoked crack once that's one crime
then he smoke crack again that's the
second crime then you smoke crack again
that's the third crime so probably you
know 400 and
like 43 of these are just smoking crack
so crack is not a crime well I don't
know uh
so I don't know how many actual crimes
there were but the financial ones are
the ones I worry about
so let's talk about the State of the
Union speech
so here are some uh the funnier
reactions
and before I get to them I I just like
to say something because on this live
stream we like to take the high road
I'm all about the high road right I
don't like to get down in the the weeds
and blaming people and stuff a small a
small we're above that
and one of the things that I uh is my
new uh I guess it's my new calling is to
try to get people to stop
judging an entire group by the worst
members of the group right I mean that's
the lowest thing you can do and that's
literally racist sexist and it's
literally the worst person you could be
so do not judge the entire group by any
individuals who are bad
we don't do that so that's why I'm not
judging Democrats by the fact that their
leader is a demented
Criminal
do not judge all Democrats that way it's
only the leader that they voted for and
look like they'll vote for again
so just because they vote for somebody
who's A demented Criminal
and a liar
that says nothing about them
so do not take the fact that they voted
for him by an overwhelming majority and
knew exactly what they were getting
there's no reflection on them so we're
not that kind of people
all right Thomas Massey had an
interesting uh tweet about the state of
the union and Biden's performance
and he said the tone began as quote
animatronic father at Disney Carousel of
Progress and quickly switched to quote
man shouting at kids to get off his yard
that's pretty funny
a Twitter username Mr Joshua
that's not this this is my favorite one
about Biden strange strange anger
Outburst that didn't match the message
like watching an old Chinese fight scene
dubbed in English
that's exactly what I saw because the
yelling didn't match the message
you know it's like where is my pencil
where's my pencil where's my pencil
where's the pencil
that's what it felt like to me
uh and then Geraldo
Geraldo tweet
I honestly can't tell if Geraldo is
pranking us
uh so I'm going to read heraldo's tweet
and
I don't think he's pranking
I don't think he is
but see if you can tell the difference
between a real tweet and something
that's obviously a joke
all right I'll just read his tweet so
this is Geraldo perhaps we were
surprised
because the steady stream of naysayers
critics who think Biden's a stuttering
babbling old fool but that antique
didn't show up at the State of the Union
the president we saw was robust
confident and in control he won the
nomination for re-election last night
parody Or reality
it's hard to tell isn't it
it's sort of hard to tell
he had another uh he had another tweet
praising Biden which makes me think is
real
did he actually see that
like that was his actual honest opinion
when he watched it because it could have
been it could have been yeah now I I
happen to think that heraldo's a
straight shooter
you know whether you whether you like
his opinions or not I have great respect
for him uh both for his careers and the
fact that as far as I know
he is brave he's patriotic and he tells
the truth you might not like his
opinions but as a American citizen he's
one of the best in my opinion
uh and I think he's great on Fox by the
way he does he does his job on Fox
really well
um
but here's what I saw
if you're giving a State of the Union
Address and you tell a Whopper of a lie
like like some Republicans want to
Sunset Medicare and Social Security
which means basically and them
um now he did he did specify
that it was some Republicans and he was
very clear once they started yelling at
him that he wasn't saying all
Republicans but do you think that the
State of the Union was where he should
have been saying that Republicans want
to end uh Social Security and Medicare
now it turns out that there are a few
Republicans who are suggesting that but
but there's no way it's going to happen
because the vast majority of Republicans
would never do that so so it's not a
real thing but bringing it up is just
grotesquely
misleading political divisive
and I loved the Republican reaction to
it
the Republican action was they just
yelled liar
they just yelled at him while he's
speaking and he had to stop and fight
his way out of it now I'm totally happy
with the Republican response are you
you know I wouldn't have mind that if if
that happened to a Republican
um either because if you say something
so overtly divisive and overtly
misleading
people should stop you in the middle of
your speech and just start shouting at
you to get out of town that's exactly
the right thing to do and I and again I
would have supported it no matter what
side the president was on that was so
over the line
so inappropriate and the Republicans
called them on that that was pretty
funny my other favorite part was when
laughs
this is so stupid this is so stupid that
the Republicans laughed out loud
and it was just an honest response to
how stupid he was he said that uh people
are complaining that the oil companies
don't want to invest and he's now
stopping them from investing he's just
telling them that we only need oil for
another 10 years so why don't they
invest because you know they have 10
years to make money
and the Republicans literally laughed
out loud
now
I hope I don't need to explain why
that's so dumb does anybody need that
nobody needs the explanation of why the
oil industry is not interested in
massive investment for a business that's
only going to last 10 years
does anybody need the exploit
explanation I don't think so
literally nobody would invest in that
kind of a business nobody
and Biden's up there in front of the
country representing
representing America you know the the
capitalist ideal of the the planet
and he's up there saying I don't know
why they don't invest for that 10-year
gain well I'm trying to put them out of
business as fast as I can and if I could
make that 10 years five years I'd do it
as fast as I could
yeah why don't you want to get into that
business
that's just stupid
am I wrong
how else will you just describe that
yeah I mean I don't even think it's
senile
because it
correct me if I'm wrong but it was on
the teleprompter right if it's on the
teleprompter it's not really a civility
problem
but wow wow
um
and then and then you know I turned into
MSNBC to see what the the crazy people
are saying I hear Lawrence O'Donnell's
voice saying this was the worst possible
night for Kevin McCarthy
what what
what what state of the union was he
watching
what
uh and he said he went on Lawrence
O'Donnell uh this is over from McCarthy
the year is over
so I guess Geraldo and at least one
person on MSNBC saw commanding
performance by Biden which guaranteed
him the nomination
and will make the Republicans sad and
ineffective for the rest of their time
on this Earth
the other funny thing he said was name
me a world leader who would change
places with uh chairman she as head of
China
his his context was that he's so hard on
China and China is now in such a bad
position because of how hard Biden is on
him
that there's no leader in the world who
would want to be the head of the uh
second largest economy in the world
because Little Kim he likes running as
the hermit Kingdom
and he would certainly turn down a
promotion
to be the boss of China for life
so
that was stupid
that was literally just stupid
am I wrong about that
I mean how how else now and keep in mind
I think that was on the teleprompter
I think it was on the teleprompter
how in the world did so many people
allow that to get on the teleprompter
how in the world
this has nothing to do with politics
right this is not even a political
statement it's just stupid
it's just literally stupid I don't know
what else to say about it
Sarah Huckabee did a good job of you
know the counter programming after the
State of the Union but here's the part I
like the best
she said quote giving every child access
to a quality education regardless of
their race or income is the Civil Rights
issue of our day
a plus
a plus plus
how many times have I told you
that if Trump or really any leading
Republican simply you stated their
policies in the smartest frame they
would be unbeatable
but they don't do it for whatever reason
there there is just complete
easy free money laying there
and
Sarah Huckabee Sanders
picked it up
this is exactly the right frame
this is everything
number one she she understood the
priority best who was it recently saying
that the biggest risk to the United
States was the
um
the teachers union
somebody said that was a bigger somebody
upon it said that
Gates well I've said it but somebody
else said it
there's some somebody famous said it
recently
and yeah I've said it of course oh it
was Pompeo yes I'm sorry Mike Pompeo
so have I have I ever mentioned how
smart Mike Pompeo is
do you have any idea how smart that guy
is
he's not ordinary smart he's like sort
of off the chart smart
now I don't I don't love him for
president because I've got some problems
with his policy preferences but uh he is
really smart you can't take that away
from
um
anyway so he so uh here are two
Republicans who have correctly
identified the biggest biggest risk to
The Republic
that's good
that's good but they're getting very
close to just a perfect framing of the
education thing and I think I think you
could even go a little further
um it might be hard for a
National politician to say what I'm
going to say but here's something I've
said before and I would love to see him
say it
we're never going to agree on
reparations
so let's do what we can do
let's do what's doable
what's doable is fixing the biggest part
of systemic racism which is the school
system
but you have to fix it for the poor
white people the poor Asian people Asian
American people the poorer Hispanic
American people you have to fix it for
everybody and if you do this this would
be speaking to the Black American
Community if if you can join with us and
just fix it for everybody who is poor
you will have done the greatest service
for the United States
ever
right it would be bigger than anything
and that would be something that the
Black American Community could own
they could own that one of the biggest
accomplishments that our country could
ever hope to have fixing education
and the uh and if that's not worth
anything to you
to have that sort of you know in your
into your history
right we we teach Black History Month
right
so there's there's a a genuine sort of
universal interest in making sure that
the Black American community
is completely credited for
you know historical accomplishments Etc
contribution this could be bigger than
all of that
because because this this gets to
America basically
right the thing that made America
America is that the various uh disparate
groups could get along somehow that we
had a system that would make all these
different people
be on the same team
so this this is the biggest one if you
make this work
um I would say you could add another
month to Black History Month make it
make it two months because you know I
think we would all be grateful to be on
the same side for something that big
um here's something I learned today from
Congressman Troy Nels I didn't know that
the cartels have an Air Force
did you know that
that's not very big but apparently there
have been ten thousand cartel drone
detections not ten thousand drones but
ten thousand detections so I guess the
cartels use the drones to survey
for law enforcement and for other stuff
that they might need
they have an Air Force
now
do you think if we just keep waiting
it'll be easier to take them out
I have a feeling we ought to maybe get
on this
because that you know they've got a
little bit of a Navy and a little bit of
an Air Force already
I don't think it's impossible that they
could get
you know missiles
you know I I feel like they're going to
have
I believe that if they're not already
dropping bombs from the air with the
drones that they have that it's going to
happen really fast
I think the cartels are going to be
bombing their enemies
with drones
if not already they might already be
doing it
so maybe we should get on that
um part of the car the State of the
Union was talking about the talk
apparently there's something called The
Talk
that black families often have with
their kids when they become driving age
maybe before and
the talk is if you're stopped by a
police officer
to treat the police officer respectfully
and you know make sure that your hands
are shown and basically the talk
is telling people how to handle the
authority figures without getting killed
Now Matt Walsh pointed out that uh it's
not just black and brown families like
who thinks the only black and brown
families have that talk so Matt Walsh
said when I started driving my parents
talked to me about what to do if I'm
pulled over and explained that I should
be respectful to the officer this idea
that only black families need to have
this conversation is just utterly
ridiculous nonsense
now
my parents never had this conversation
with me
and I'm not sure why but you know I'm
not a mind reader but I speculate here's
my speculation I think my parents never
sat me down and told me
that I should avoid resisting a police
officer with a gun
um
they may have and I'm just speculating
you they may have thought
that I'm not a idiot
they may have
because if I were
an idiot I wouldn't know not to start a
fight with a guy with a gun
but I was trying to think at what age
I had independently figured out not to
start a fight with somebody with a gun
I'm thinking it was age three
age three
well how old were you when you realized
this starting a fight with somebody who
had a gun
and a reason to use it
how old were you when you realize that
was a bad idea
about three right
you're probably watching TV
and you thought wow if one of them has a
gun
and that other one doesn't have a gun
all right two and two yeah yeah you
don't want to start a fight with
somebody who has a gun
so
do you really need to have
do you do you really need to have that
talk
all right I said something highly
provocative today
it's a question but I actually Wonder
has anybody who was sober that includes
drugs right sober has there ever been
someone who was sober
and had an IQ over 110.
who has ever been killed in a police
stop in a in a vehicle
like ever
I don't think so
so I think the thing that we're avoiding
is it's a stupid drunk problem
we're stupid inebriated problem we keep
asking like it's some kind of police
problem or some kind of a race problem
it's just a stupid proof it's a stupid
problem stupid and drunk right
I don't believe any uh I don't believe
any black person who
you know was totally sober
and let's say he was smart enough to
have a job
it wasn't a criminal had a job
I don't think any of them have ever been
killed
and if they were it was because
something weird happened now I tweeted
this and I expected a bunch of people to
say
what you said so so here I'm saying in
the comments OMG seriously
I was looking for I thought people would
give me examples of the opposite
but they gave me examples of people who
were killed not in car stops
people who were drunk
but but are we at a point where we can
just say this
yeah no this has nothing to do with race
I I'm not bringing race into it all
I'm saying that no matter who you are
if you're sober
and you're an adult and you have an IQ
over 110. I'll bet nobody's ever been
killed by police
unless it was just the weirdest
situation of you know mistaken something
some kind of mistaken identity thing
but that would happen you know no matter
what you did if it was mistaken identity
no that's not true that is a racist
statement if you think that speaking
about IQ in this context is racial
it's not that's that's on you you're
making that connection I'm just saying
that if you're smart and sober you don't
start a fight with somebody I was a gun
do you
and if you do
well I'm not sure you have an IQ of 110.
you know maybe you have some anger
problem but the talk isn't going to help
you how much is the talk going to help
you
all right anyway those are just some
questions I'll probably get canceled for
saying that
and that's fine there's a new piece of
software that should scare everybody in
the creative industry
especially if you make movies so I saw
this from
Machiavelli's uh
account on Twitter and the new software
is called Runway
and it'll be hard for me to describe
exactly what it can do but I'll give you
some examples
you can take any existing
um video
and you can combine it with some other
video and you can say use the style of
the other video
and just make a whole complete video
without style now that doesn't quite
explain what it is until I give the
example
so the example showed a video of
somebody walking on the moon you know
moonwalk
and then separately
somebody took a video of themselves
walking in the snow
and then they said combine these two but
use the style of this the space Band
and so the person walking into the snow
turned into a moonscape with a person in
a space outfit walking through the Moon
they basically created a whole movie
with a style costumes and everything
else
just by one sentence
use the style of this video
that's it and then as the person who
made their own video moved around they
were just moving around but wearing a
spacesuit and you can do that with faces
backgrounds people you can create an
entire movie
just by walking around in your own
clothes
and then later you know bringing your
style over and and the entire movie will
be populated so you don't even have to
go frame to frame say all right and this
Frame replace this with this
it does it all
instantly and perfectly
now add that to the fact that you can
reproduce any voice now
with AI
and you can type in any dialogue and you
might not even have to give a dialogue
I think we're pretty close to the point
with a few different AIS it's not all in
one I AI but a few different I think you
could write the script
and have it create the movie in about 10
minutes
here's how you do it you say hey AI I'm
not sure which one you use for this but
one of them does this uh aai write me a
movie that has a three-act structure and
is in the style of and then you name a
famous movie writer
or something in the style of
um Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible
but it's a new movie
yeah just use that style and by the way
you should read this book called save
the cat that tells you how to write good
movie structure
the AI will write the entire movie in
about a second
and then you take that whole script
and you say use this style
use the Tom Cruise style of you know
what the Mission Impossible movies look
like
and then you walk outside and you know
you walk around and maybe you're even in
your your own office doing stuff or
maybe maybe you don't even need to maybe
it just creates you
put you in the movie and has you do all
the scenes
so I think you might be able to create
an entire movie and maybe two minutes
and that's
already here
already here so everybody who kept
saying
this AI you keep talking about it's
always in the future it's the flying car
oh the flying car is going to be here
tomorrow where's my flying car
and I've been saying
no it's software
when it gets here it's going to appear
here really fast it's going to be not
here not here not here oh
everything changed and that's where we
are we're in the next year cannot be
predicted
you cannot predict
next year
and this is the first time in history
that that's been this true I mean you
can't predict pandemics and stuff but
nothing's been less predictable
than what's going to happen in the next
year it could be anything
I don't think it'll be bad necessarily
but it could be anything
so that's where we're going with that
um
I recommend a YouTube Interview with Dr
Jordan Peterson and Dr Richard lindsen
which you should just Google you can
find it so a search for Dr Jordan
Peterson and then climate change or Dr
Richard lindsen l-i-n-d-z-e-n
now
uh the first part of the video
is a whole bunch about the credentials
of Dr lindson which are extreme all
right and the reason that Peterson spent
so much time on his credentials is that
he's going to say something that will
blow your mind
and unless you know how serious a
scientist this guy is it's just not
going to work like the communication
can't even work until you know how much
of a you know a study is scientifically
all right so he's right at the top you
know best schools best experience right
place and he's at an age where he saw
the entire climate change
narrative
created and so he explained how the
narrative was created which I'm going to
call tentatively a hoax hoax isn't
exactly the right word for this but it
gets you close to it he explains how it
arised
and in a way that is completely
convincing now do you remember the
documentary effect
you have to really beware here the
documentary effect as I've described on
Twitter is when you watch one
documentary you think it's totally true
because they will leave out the other
argument
if you'd never see the other argument
you're going to be really really
convinced by the one you see so when you
watch this be careful
because it's super persuasive
super persuasive
but you're not seeing the other side so
just keep that in mind right so keep a
little bit of skepticism alive but man
it's persuasive and one of the things
one of the things that Dr Lindsay does
that's persuasive since I talk about
persuasion a lot is he ends on the best
down notes I've ever heard
now here's what I mean
you would sound unconfident in your own
opinion if you end in an up note so if I
said
I think the moon is made of cheese
I think there's climate change
see that sounds unconfident and I've
taught you before that if you end on a
on a lower note you sound like you know
what you're talking about
well we've got climate change
the climate change is caused by the CO2
right so if you end on the low note you
sound like a serious person who knows
what you're talking about
Dr lindsen ends on the best low note
you've ever heard
because he actually drags it out a
little bit so so he'll say something
like I'm just making this one up but
he'll he'll say something like uh
uh
the uh the climate change
is caused by a variety of things but I'm
not so sure it's entirely caused by the
CO2
and he just he just milks that low note
so he sounds so smart and he actually is
so you know it's compatible with his
actual knowledge all right here is what
I learned from that
number one
uh global warming is not the first time
that the energy business has been
attacked
and there was some speculation
but why is it that you know first
there's global cooling so don't use this
first there's then there's pollution so
get rid of your energy now there's CO2
so get rid of your energy it seemed like
there were lots of reasons historically
and this is the historical perspective
that Dr Lindsay gives
and and you wonder why but I think this
is this is sort of my take on this
but one of the things I hadn't
considered is that there's some group of
people who are more about income
inequality
meaning that everybody in the energy
business and and anybody who uses it is
probably wealthy
people who don't use a lot of energy
probably less so
and the the people who think everybody
should be a little more equal a little
bit more socialist or maybe not so happy
that people are getting rich in the
energy business and they just like a
little less of it a little more green
stuff so we're all about the same you
know everybody's eating granola now of
course this is a mind-reading
speculative thing right we can't know
what people are thinking
but I don't know what do you think do
you think there's any group of people
who are just sort of jealous
of the prosperity of others
do you think that's the thing
because jealousy is such a universal
thing you'd expect there's some of it
but I don't know I don't the part that
I'm not completely on board with is does
that TR does that jealousy translate
into
wanting to take out the Big Rich energy
business probably
a little bit then you've also got the
media alarmists who can make money by
going after the energy business you've
got the green opportunists and
entrepreneurs who can make money
because the alternatives are you know
being funded so people are happy to you
know be against the energy business uh
you've got brainwashed kids who are
against it not for reasons but because
they're kids because they've been
brainwashed
which is how all kids learn everything
basically of course there's China who
would like the energy business to go out
of business because that would make us
less competitive there are posers who
just want to look good and say oh big
big energy is bad so people who are just
basically it's about their identity and
that you've got these weird people the
anti-humanists who believe that the
planet is better without people
you know for a while I thought they
didn't exist but there actually are some
of them and they're they're kind of
noisy
there aren't that many of them but
they're they can be prominent
um so there are a whole bunch of reasons
historically that the energy energy
business has been attacked but Dr
Lindsay points out that the CO2 attack
is the smartest one do you know why
because there's always going to be CO2
in the air
so you always have something to complain
about because CO2 will just always be
there it doesn't matter what you do so
you just always have something to
complain about
all right so
I would say that this part is more
speculative than what I'm going to talk
about next
the next part blew my mind
I never heard this
and of course this is this is more
opinion uh this is opinion not fact
but this is Dr lindsen's uh description
of how we got here
how we got here is fascinating
if it's true right so here's the steak
it started out this way a scientist now
this is you know generically this is how
it works generically speaking a
scientist will do a paper and say hey it
looks like
it looks like CO2 might make us one
degree warmer by some date
now what's missing from that is
therefore the Earth will be destroyed
scientists didn't say that
scientists just said hey I think
temperature might go up a little bit
but that turns into a panic by the time
it gets to the media and it gets to The
Advocates so The Advocates turn this
non-scary statement of well maybe you
temperature up a degree
they turned this into the world will end
which was never what the scientist said
and then the politicians say oh my God
my God my God we have to do something
about this because the media's got all
our voters whipped up so they say we
will put massive amount of money into
this to fix it
and that money goes back to the
scientists
who wants to say
oh I didn't say it's an emergency
I just said the temperature might go up
a little
but if they say it might be emergency
well you know you don't know if it's an
emergency maybe we should study it
so you very quickly created a situation
where the only way you could get funding
was to say there was a panic and we
better do something about it
and once that Dynamic started
Dr Linson talked about two times that he
got a paper published in a in a
scientific publication and both times
the editor was fired immediately because
he didn't his papers didn't agree with
the narrative
certainly you would be fired immediately
if you tried to stop the money train
because think what would happen if you
published a paper that said oh oh you
can stop sending all this money
you can just save it don't send any
money to scientists my paper has shown
that climate change is no problem
you couldn't get that published because
the money train was too big
right so where we are is we're just in
this weird situation where a lot of
people have probably convinced
themselves as true
but it was never based on science
because because none of this came from
the scientists the scientists were just
responding to the money and then of
course they found confirmation
of course they did because that's where
the money was
the money will get you anything you want
if if Congress funded science to find
ghosts
like actual ghosts
how many ghosts would the scientists
find
a lot
yeah the answer is a lot they would find
all the ghosts they could find they
would find indirect evidence of ghosts
they would find a video of a ghost
they'd find ghosts talking to you they'd
have oh there would be ghost ghost ghost
papers and
all right so then there were a few other
things that Dr lindsen confirmed
that I had always suspected
do you know what the value of a
peer-reviewed study is
do you know the peer Reviewer is just
checking to see if he did the obvious
math right
that's all they do
they're just looking for is the paper
interesting so it has to be like
different enough that it's worthy of
attention is it interesting
and is there any obvious math problem
that's it and then the the public thinks
that it's been reviewed by another
scientist and since two scientists have
looked at it and agreed
must be pretty good must be solid
nothing like that's happening
peer review doesn't have any value
except you know checking the basic math
I guess
none in fact peer review prevents
papers that are against the narrative
so peer review actually
hides the truth
because one part is oh here's a paper
from Dr Lindsay nope sorry
peer review
reduces the truth it does not reveal it
it reduces it by its Nature by Design
not designed but by its feature and then
the funniest thing was listening to Dr
lindsen describe how the prediction
models for climate science have been
created
now I can't I can't uh
I can't summarize it in a way that's
that would do credit to it but suffice
to say
that if you imagine that Dilbert
is sort of a universal you know thing in
all business
science too
apparently the models are as ridiculous
as you knew
they're ridiculous
and and it doesn't take you know more
than a few minutes of him talking about
them before you're actually laughing
that so I'll just give you one example
this is just one example
when a climate model uh doesn't work
like it wildly goes too high or too low
and she'd know it's wrong
they'll put in a
a what do you call it a
like a moderating variable
they'll just put in a variable that
stops IT from being wildly wrong but the
variable is just something they make up
they a damper right they put it in a
damper a dampening variable a dampening
variable is just a variable they make up
in their head to make it come out the
way they wanted it to come out is is
literally not even close to science not
not even close
and so we're we're spending you know
gazillion dollars
based on these um
predictions
that no reasonable person thinks are
credible nobody nobody involved thinks
they're credible unless they're making
money by selling them of course
so that's just a uh you know a taste of
it so
uh oh and here here is my favorite part
everything that you thought was true
turns out to be true you know or at
least confirmed by somebody who was in
the middle of it and what was do you
remember the other day I said do you
really believe that scientists can
measure the temperature of the Earth
do you remember me saying that
and just laughing
that anybody ever believed that was the
case
if you ever believe that scientists
could measure the temperature of the
Earth
and then compare it to what it was
before
you there's something wrong with you
like nobody who's lived five minutes in
the real world thinks that's possible
and then then I'm listening to Dr
Lindsey talk about it it's like no it's
not possible and no they haven't done it
they've produced a number they have
produced numbers but no you can't
measure the temperature of the earth
that's not really a thing we can do
and there's an obvious reason
you can measure a whole bunch of places
but every place you didn't measure
is a place that could be storing some
extra energy that you didn't know about
so you're not really measuring anything
you're only measuring those locations
and even those locations and you get a
number of other criticisms that would
convince you beyond a doubt
that it's all garbage
now given all that if you imagine that
his his take on it is true
could you call climate change a hoax
does that word fit
now keep in mind that he says that 97 of
scientists including himself
would agree with the statement that CO2
is a greenhouse gas and that it would
increase warming to some amount
so he's not arguing with the basic idea
the CO2 couldn't cause warming he's just
saying it's not it's not important
amount of warning
compared to all the other variables
all right so
but we have a possibility
I suppose it's a small one
that Trump will be considered right
about this as well
when he called the Chinese Oaks now
that's like hyperbole China is one part
of the story and hoax isn't exactly
right because I'm not sure that these
people were lying
they may have just motivated reasoning
oh well if you're going to give me money
I believe this now people will come to
believe whatever is consistent with
their thoughts that they're good people
if they think they're good people
they're not going to imagine a world in
which they're lying to get money
they'll imagine that they actually
believe that their studies are useful
and telling you something
so I'm not sure hoax is the right word
but definitely
um I'm I'm of the current working
opinion
that climate change is ridiculously
absurd in terms of its risk
and that there's no there's no real
long-term risk we'll probably be safer
in the future not not in more Danger so
that's my current View and it's not too
far from my view before except more
confirmation of things that I thought
were obvious I mean the things I thought
were obvious from my own experience
there's no way you could make a climate
model that predicts
all right I did not need Dr lindsen to
tell me that because I've worked on a
lot of prediction models and you know
that it's the assumptions that drive
them it's not the data
the data doesn't drive them it's your
assumptions and your assumptions are
guesses so I mean I knew that because
I've done data models but if you've
never done them you think oh scientists
are doing them they they might have some
science in them there's no science in
them
there's no science in those models so I
knew that I also knew just from living
in the real world that you couldn't
measure the temperature of the Earth
and and know that you had something
useful across time I knew that just
common sense if you lived in the world
you knew it
now that doesn't mean those two things
did not alone mean that we had no risk
but what I hear Dr lindsden talk about
it in in context and you re you realize
the whole history of how the energy
business has always been under attack
and when one attack doesn't work they
just change it to a new attack
through history
oh here's here's uh some hallucination
so somebody says to me Craig Baker says
you in capitals stated that the models
are good and improving in relationship
to Tony Heller
that is something I never said
Greg you were hallucinating if you
believe I ever said the models are good
really
I don't know what drugs you're doing but
that's the uh that's just that's
literally the closest to the opposite of
what I represent
oh and Craig is yelling in caps yeah
Scott you did say the models are good
you see what I deal with every day
there's like an actual living person who
is smart enough to get on here and make
a comment
who believes that what I've said
consistently forever was the opposite
and and believes Craig believes he saw
it
he actually believes he saw it and lived
through it
well
uh let's see what else we got going on
here today
oh uh did anybody see uh the war room
with Steve Bannon talking about me
did anybody see that it's on Monday I
guess
he had a guest on and they were talking
about my
my long coveted opinions Etc
and so he brings on the guy who has a
different opinion for me
I'll call him my critic just for
shorthand
and the critics complained because I
said
um
that their heuristics beat my Analytics
and he wanted to correct that oh no
Scott we used analytics we used
analytics you're not the only one who's
Athletics you're making yourself like
you analyzed
and we guessed but here's my
clarification
when I said your heuristics be my
Analytics the context was that I guessed
my Analytics
were guessing
which I've said as clearly as possible
so analytics was not a real word in this
context I was saying my analytics
because I was guessing
so I analyzed it but there was nothing
to analyze so I guess
so their biggest complaint is my use of
a word which is the opposite of how I
used it so that was the biggest
complaint second biggest complaint was
uh you know he says something about long
covid
and then
after after noting that my big
question was how could anybody how could
anybody know the risk of long covet
he never got back to that
I only have one question for all my
critics
how did you calculate the risk of Law
and covet and watch how they can't
answer the question they actually have
to change the subject
all of them every one of them will
change the subject and he did the same
so it's once you see the the seven tells
for cognitive dissonance
once you know the seven it's really
obvious every time you see it so I'll
I'll tell you the
the seven tells again changes the topic
uh ad hominems mind reading word salad
using an analogy and place of reason you
can use analogies but don't use them in
place of reasons
insists it's complicated and can't be
summarized and then there's the sotel
where you say so you're saying that
water is dry where they had something
that you didn't say
um
so I think you see that in every case so
that you if you want to see some another
example that just watched the War Room
with Steve Bannon
um
now some of you say and I I guess I have
to reiterate that that uh you didn't
calculate long covid because nobody knew
what the risk was
I didn't know what the risk was
so that's why I guessed
that's why you guess because you didn't
know what the risk was
all right
um
I have a cold now
as far as you know all right looking at
your comments
you gave long covet too much weight and
still do
that did that comment make sense
so in order for me to have given long
covet too much weight that suggests that
you know the risk of long covet
please tell me how
please explain how you knew that because
I don't know it
now here's another factor that I've
never said out loud
directly
if I were 25 years old
would I be worried about long coveted
let's say long covet would take you out
for a month
nope nope because if I lost a month of
my life to Long covet
at age 25 is such a small percentage of
the rest of my life that that would be
that would be a reasonable trade-off
now at my current age how many good
years do you think I have left where I'm
healthy and I can do what I want
maybe two
maybe two
because I'm at the age where people are
younger than me are dying from old age
people younger than me are like suddenly
dying and even if I don't die I'm in a
very thin window
where I could still do Physically Active
things
you know I can still play tennis if I
want to whatever
so if I got my ass kicked for let's say
a few months
that's actually a pretty big percentage
of the two years that I feel confident I
might have
so long covered to somebody who only has
a few years left
is not the same calculation
as if you're 25. and a lot of people
made the mistake of assuming that you
know everybody's the same age so
everything all our calculations are the
same my calculation wasn't anything like
your calculation I literally thought
maybe I have two years
so long covet is a big percentage of
that
so whoever said
I'm giving too much attention to Long
covet
it's too much for a 25 year old
too much for a 40 year old
I don't think it was too much for me
and the only decision I've ever talked
about was my own I've never recommended
anybody to do anything
I'm 65.
all right uh printer get fixed now
please arrange a conversation with dark
horse what do I have to say
I mean my whole argument is you were
guessing on long covid therefore you
were guessing
do you know how the conversation would
go let I won't let's not talk about Dark
Horse let's say I did a did an interview
with somebody who thinks I got
everything wrong here's how the
conversation would go Scott how did you
come how did you calculate long covet
well word salad word salad word salad
okay but
but how did you calculate it oh word
solid didn't matter it didn't matter
assumed it away
well okay if you assumed it away then
you calculated it as a low number how'd
you do that well word salad word salad
word salad
right it would be useless useless
do you think anybody's good do you think
there's anybody
on the other side who would listen to
that say oh
you know what
wow yeah in your case your specific case
long covet would be a big variable and
you know now that you pointed out
nobody can calculate what that risk is
yeah you're right Scott I had nothing to
throw it that way do you think it would
go that way
does anybody imagine it would go that
way
no
no so you're living you're living in
like a dream and
where reasonable people can talk about
reasonable things and then somebody will
change their opinion
I've never seen that
I've never seen that at all
right now
so I was also accused
of mind reading
for thinking that other people had not
you know considered everything in their
decision
to which I say I don't have to read your
mind I just have to look at long covet
and know that
you didn't talk about it because you
just told me you didn't consider it
it's no there's no mind reading it's
right there you told me you didn't
consider it that's what I'm saying we're
on the same page
oh and here is here was the assumption
that was built into this
the assumption is that the sicker you
got with covid
logically the worse your long-covered
risk would be
now I don't have a confirmation of that
but that's my point my point is I don't
know but it does make sense to imagine
that the sicker you are you know the
worse your symptoms could be
so that was built into the Assumption of
things I don't know
same as any illness correct
all right that's all I got for now
uh Lance you didn't understand my point
so let me explain it to you so Lance
says with the so he starts with a sew
that was literally one of my seven tells
for cognitive dissonance but okay
he says so you don't think Brett and
Heather would understand your point
is that what I said
did I say that Brett and Heather
wouldn't understand my point nope nope
nope it's easy to understand
I'm saying that they would be triggered
into cognitive dissonance
because they understood the point right
the cognitive dissonance is because they
would understand the point
if they didn't understand the point then
they wouldn't be triggered it's
understanding the point that triggers
the cognitive distance
so no I don't believe there's any
realistic way I could talk to my critics
because they would go into crazy town
right away
and it would just be it would just be a
show
see ya doctor Funk juice everybody say
see you later to DJ Dr Funk juice one of
my favorite one of my favorite uh live
stream followers and Twitter followers
always appreciate you
the Banker's Beast what's that
all right that's enough for now I'm
gonna go talk to the uh
locals people after I make them totally
