[Laughter]
the moment i started youtube just gave
me an error message but not the comments
how about now
let's see if we can stay online for a
minute
was it my topic
what was it that's causing youtube to
spaz out
yeah i used to think oh it's my internet
connection but i have two platforms
going and the locals platform has been
fine
so whatever it is it's
common to only youtube
all right so
uh
let's uh
let's regather our thoughts
now that we've had this technical
problem
i would like to tell you that this is
not the first technical problem i've had
this morning
no
the first technical problem i had was
my cat
so i got my cat back from the
veterinarian hospital
five different medications on five
different schedules
plus feeding her through a tube
and all the schedules are different and
all the names of the drugs are things i
can't remember and can't pronounce
now if there could be a task i am less
suited for than keeping all of that
straight
i don't know what it is but the cat's
been home and she's happy and
so we've been reunited and it was very
very good but before we get into the
news
the special news
let me just tell you that the thing you
need to make this a special day and i
think you will i think you will
do you feel it yet
do you feel a little bit of a tingle
that your day is starting to get better
yeah it is
you can feel it already and it's going
to go to a new level as soon as you take
your hand and put it on a cup or a mug
or a glass of tanker chelsea stand a
stein a canteen joke or flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better the thing that's
making you feel better right now it's
called the simultaneous sip
and it's going to happen right now join
me go
oh yeah
that's good
so just before i signed on and i did not
include in my notes i saw that
matt gates is trending
he just tweeted that
uh tucker carlson is right when he talks
about the replacement theory
now the replacement theory if you've
never heard of it
is a
racist sounding idea in which the belief
is that the white
dominant culture of this country or at
least historically dominant culture
is intentionally being replaced
by people from other countries and other
cultures
and
uh
matt gates says yes that's completely
accurate and that's happening and that
the adl
who is pushing back against this idea
from tucker the adl itself is racist
now
um
i think this is one of those
situations
one of the
glenn i i've got a conspiracy theorist
here
i want you to see all right you can
still see that there's not much
but you can see it there's real coffee
oops now there's real coffee on my desk
it was in the cup
a little of it is on my desk
but glenn
you have to believe somebody
somebody you have to trust
in this big old world of ours
where we have nothing but conspiracy
theories and fake news
is there one thing you can trust
just one thing
yes
you can trust
that my coffee cup has real coffee in it
well a little watered down but basically
coffee
so anyway
talking about matt gates um here's the
interesting part of that
matt gates has learned his technique i
would say at least
observationally it seems this way
from trump
uh and
man does he know how to make news
you know the same way that trump will
say something where you'll say to
yourself
wait a minute
i'm not so sure
you can say that out loud or you think
to yourself well i see what his point is
but it feels like people are going to
interpret this as a little racist
and that of course is what gives it all
the energy
if there's one thing
if there's one thing
i can teach you about going viral or
about writing a best-selling book or
having any kind of
entertainment property that people care
about here's a rule to keep in mind
to get people's interest and hold it
whether it's a meme or a tv show or
anything else
you have to show that somebody's in
trouble
in danger
somebody needs to be in danger
in order for you to get attention
now the person who's in danger could be
the person who's talking
in this case matt gates is putting
himself in danger
because he said something that you know
is going to get all kinds of people
accusing him of being a racist right now
of course he knew that
before he said it
so in order to get attention he said
something that makes you say oh
is he gonna get canceled is this his
last day as a politician
is he done
i don't know
probably not i mean probably not
but
because you think that
it just holds your attention
so this is what trump does consistently
he'll say things that you say oh that's
the world's going to blow up isn't it
but then it doesn't
the world doesn't blow up
so uh that's my only point about matt
gates is he's good at getting attention
there
so boo the cat is back and healthy uh if
i didn't mention that already
so
in case you were rooting for boo the cat
she's doing well um but it will be my
full-time job to be her nursemaid
pretty much
pretty much all day long for the next
week i'm just going to be giving her
food and beds by her little
feeding tube
so there's a story by let's see yahoo
news
is the story they interviewed 30 former
u.s officials and they came up with the
story that cia officials under the trump
administration
allegedly made secret plans to kidnap or
even assassinate wikileaks founder
julian assange
do you think that's true
let's give a uh let's give a fact check
do you think it's true
that the cia officials under trump
made secret plans that they did not
execute but they made secret plans to
kidnap or assassinate wikileaks founder
what do you think now trump says he
never considered it
so now what do you think trump says he
never considered it but the story is
that the cia
did draw plans
they they both can be true
all right
these are not opposites
i believe it is 100 true that trump
never considered it in the sense of
never was serious
about considering it he may have heard
it
somebody may have floated it but that's
different than considering it exactly
considering it means there was some
chance you might have done it
i would tell you from my own
my own sources that it is deeply deeply
unlikely trump ever considered this
so that's that's for my own sources
very unlikely
that trump ever considered assassinating
julian assange
but did the cia come up with a plan at
least you know draw down on paper maybe
is that a problem
is it a problem if the cia came up with
a plan to do this i don't think so
unfortunately it's not a problem
because the military
and i would imagine the cia is the same
should have a plan for everything
for everything that might happen
right
don't you think that they come up with
plans for all kinds of things they don't
do just in case they need to do
i'm not sure that this story has any
contradiction in it or even a problem
do you have a problem if the cia is
making plans for things that it decides
not to do
i don't have a problem for that
why would that be a problem they make
plans for everything
now
obviously if the cia was trying to make
it happen and you don't want that to
happen that's a problem but the report
is just that they made plans
i don't know if that alone should bother
me because they should make a plan for
everything
right
they don't know what the president's
going to order they should have
something at least on paper ready to
talk about if he asks about it
but
the reporting seems to indicate that
mike pompeo
was the one who was mostly behind it
the at least the planning
suppose that's true
can you believe it i i wouldn't believe
the reporting necessarily just because i
don't really believe any reporting
anymore but suppose it's true that mike
pompeo
was wanting to kill uh assange
doesn't that rule him out for president
if it's a problem he's
you can't support him for president can
you
um
yeah i think that would take pompeo
right out of the running
but we'll see because first of all i
don't necessarily believe that he even
had any involvement in any way we don't
know
what is a bad combination
let me tell you this could be like a new
segment
bad combinations things you don't want
to put together because if you put them
together bad things happen
for example
john bolton is talking about the taliban
maybe someday taking over pakistan and
getting 150 nuclear weapons two things
you don't want to put together
taliban
150 nuclear weapons right so things you
don't want to put together
here's another one
you don't want to put together
tick-tock and dumb people
do not combine tick tock
and dumb people
you're going to get a bad result
for example there was a fedex
driver
who posted a tick tock video vowing
never to deliver to homes that support
joe biden kamala harris or black lives
matter
um his job did not last very long
no
he was immediately fired
so two things you don't want to put
together
the taliban and nuclear weapons
and tick tock and dumb people
dumb people plus tick tock bad
combination
do not put them together
all right here's some uh fake news fake
news uh where was this and uh
um damn it i forgot who was reporting
this fake news but
um
so there's a
report that trump could face
multiple criminal charges i think this
was in the daily mail
that he he could he could face multiple
criminal charges do you know who else
could
who else could you say this story about
you
you
me
everybody else
do you know who could maybe face
multiple criminal
a lot of people
they won't
but a lot of people could
right
so that's a weird way to say something
how about donald trump is not facing any
criminal charges
how about that that's true right
there are no criminal charges against
president trump why not say that
it could be
maybe somebody will come up with
something later
but haven't heard of it
but anyway the thought is that he could
have some uh criminal liability for his
attempts
quote his attempts to overturn the 2020
election
uh loss in georgia
and and this report is still reporting
that
trump told us uh brad rafsenberger the
secretary of state
to find 11 780 votes
enough enough votes to make him
president instead of biden
and or at least in the state
to give him the win in the state
and
that is a fake news reporting on the
context
because when you hear the whole context
it's pretty clear that trump was not
asking him to do anything illegal
but rather believe that the election was
genuinely fraudulent
you know true or not he seems to have
believed it
and was asking him to help find
fraudulent votes
so here it is trump asking somebody
to identify fraudulent votes which is
exactly what you'd want everybody to do
right
is there anybody who doesn't want to
identify the fraudulent votes
why wouldn't trump ask for that and why
wouldn't rafsenberger want to do it
i mean if you could do it easily i mean
there's a practical element to it
but everybody would want to know if
there were any
fraudulent votes
and trump just gave them numbers like if
we found this many would reverse things
so i'd like you to find that many
that's really different
from
you know somehow pressuring him to lie
that's not in there
so this is just total fake news
uh where does this come from oh the dc
think tank the brookings institute
right the brookings institute is who who
it is who says he might be facing
multiple charges
who the hell is at brookings institute
uh unless it's like
a bunch of uh lawyers or or somehow
independent and i doubt that they're i
doubt that they're an unbiased institute
obviously
um
let's talk about the plot to control you
i saw a tweet by unhoodwinked
one of my followers on twitter
unhoodwinked
and
between it today can we finally admit
that the policies both now and in the
past like lockdowns and mass on children
are not to protect people
but instead our new precedence to train
obedience and servitude to power hungry
state actors how many of you watching
agree with this take that the lockdowns
and the masks
are part of a larger
a larger process
by which power hungry state actors are
training the public
to obedience
all right i'm saying on locals lots of
yeses
lots of no's but lots of yeses
and then on youtube lots of yeses some
no's
right more yeses than those
100 100
so would you like me to talk about that
because this is my
this is my sweet spot right
don't you think that of all the people
you could listen to
on the topic of whether you're being
brainwashed
who would be a good source for sorting
that out for you i would right it's sort
of my specialty
trained hypnotist talk about persuasion
all the time
so
let's talk about this
do you believe
that you are being manipulated and
trained for
uh
obedience
so those of you believe it give me a
little bit more
i'm going to ask you for a little bit
more who is it who's doing it
who who's specifically let's say in the
united states
now it's happening all over the world
right
so what whatever is happening in the
united states
must be reproducing itself all over the
place
so let's just talk about the united
states
uh who exactly in the united states just
the united states now for a moment we'll
talk about the other countries but who
in the united states is doing it
and for what personal uh benefit
to what benefit
blackrock a.i
intelligence community the dnc satan
big pharma bankers
corporations globalists fouchy cartels
ccp china unions the ama
a lot of different answers
so
so here's here's the first point
when i first asked the question are
there deep state
power people who just want to train you
a lot of people said yes
but when i asked you who they are
your answers were all over the place
right
now
so far i'm just objectively speaking
there's no opinion yet your answers were
all over the place about who these
people are
and since the who
is different for all of you
wouldn't this also mean that they had
different motivations right
now do you think that there are people
who want to train you and get power just
because they like the power
how many of you think that's a thing
that they want power just for the power
it's not it's not a specific thing that
they're trying to train you for it's
just the power
just sort of generally the power
right
okay
so
and you know that there are you know
millions and millions of people who
independently
agree with the people in power right
would you agree that there are lots of
doctors and researchers and just
independent people who have nothing to
do with these power people at the top
who agree with them that we should wear
masks
or we should do lockdowns etc
so whatever it is that the elites are
trying to push
would you agree with the following
statement
that there are plenty of experts
who also think it's a good idea just for
medical reasons
would you agree
that there are plenty of real experts
who also think it's a good whether
they're right or wrong
but they also think it's a good idea to
do all the things that these
power elites are want us to do
so
yeah i think you agree with that so what
how do you make
sense of something where there's a
legitimate
medical interest in doing it now keep in
mind there might be right or it might be
wrong right the experts could be right
the experts could be wrong it could go
either way but it's true that they do
have that opinion
right whether they're right or wrong
they they are of the opinion
that um these are good things
would you agree
there are plenty of independent people
so even if the elites are doing it for
for sneaky reasons to take power
it's also true that it's medically
recommended by every
major medical group in every country
basically except sweden i guess
all right
so the first thing you want to question
yourself if you think it's part of a big
power move by the elite is who are they
and why is it that their power move is
exactly what um
independent professionals would say they
should do
because it wouldn't that be a weird
coincidence
that the actual best thing you could do
for your health
according to the experts again they
could be right or they could be wrong
but the experts do say mass and social
distancing
are something you should do
what are the odds that coincidentally
it's it's medically recommended but also
coincidentally
it's really good for the secret plot to
train you to be more obedient
i don't know
i would say that should put a little
question mark into your into your
thinking wouldn't you
does anybody respond to that point
shouldn't that at least make you
question
the hypothesis that it's only being done
for power reasons
there's just so many individuals who
also agree with it who are experts
i'm not an expert so i'm not saying who
is right or wrong
i'm just saying that they exist
okay so that's the first thing number
two
why would anybody want to give power to
other people
do you know anybody
who wants to give power to other people
over themselves
do any of you wish to increase the
amount of power other people have over
you anybody in the in the comments but
just talk about yourself let's not let's
not read other people's mind for
yourself
do you personally would you like to give
more power to other people over your
life
who would like to do more of that right
nobody
pretty much nobody
but here's my problem with this idea
that there's this secret elite
power-hungry state actors
they're also giving power to other
people
because
let's say
pelosi
she has to wear a mask too
right
she's also giving power to somebody
what about
biden himself
biden's giving power to somebody too
he's got to wear a mask and he's got to
do a bunch of stuff he's probably not
too happy about it
do you think biden would like the
pandemic to go away
let me ask you this would biden be
politically better off or worse off
if the pandemic stays
or if or if he solves it
what could be better for the biden
administration than solving the pandemic
and getting your mask off how it well
let me ask you this somebody says you're
full of bs
let me ask you this
if biden and harris wanted to
maintain power let's say the democrats
want to maintain power
and they have two possibilities
one possibility is to train the public
to be more obedient with the masks and
the mandates
and the other is to solve the pandemic
and get things get things working again
which of those two plans is more
practical
and would give you more power
i'm looking at your answers which would
give you more power solving the pandemic
or extending it and making everybody
unhappy about it but at least you'd be
training them training them to be more
obedient
i'm seeing a lot of people say extending
it
explain that
why would extending
why would extending it and losing the
next election be good for them
you realize that they'll lose the
election right
you know the worse the lockdowns and the
masking are
the worse all that is when you've got to
vote
the more you're going to hold it against
whoever's in power
i'm saying mail in voting we'll talk
about that in a minute
why is male 1 voted why are you saying
mail in voting
oh i say you say mail in voting because
the pandemic
would cause the mail in voting and then
you could cheat on the mail in voting
and then you could win elections okay
okay
um
but it seems to me that the mail in
voting
looks like it's been solved in a few a
few states
all right just read your comments
[Music]
oh
all right
another emergency just popped up
today are you having one of those days
where
everything is happening to me is some
kind of an emergency and everything has
to happen at once like there's nothing
that could wait
you ever have one of those days nothing
can wait
everything has to happen right now and
it's an emergency if it doesn't
that's what my day's like so far
um
all right
so
here's my next question
uh if you think that it's all about the
um
the male in balance
do you think that the pandemic is going
to change that
because i feel as though
whether we had a pandemic or not the
male in ballot situation would stay the
same at this point
don't you think
because it seems that people just like
mail-in ballots and you get more of them
and blah blah blah i don't think they
need a pandemic for mail-in ballots do
you i mean
it did kick-start things and they
certainly took advantage of it
so i would agree with you that they took
advantage of it
to beat trump there's no i think that's
fair to say do we all agree on that that
the that the way the ru the rules of
elections were gamed by the democrats
was quite masterful
and they got away with it because it was
you know they did it through legal means
and they got a set of rules that worked
for them yeah so the pandemic definitely
did change the power structure but i
think at this point
at this point i think people either like
mail-in ballots or not
independent of the pandemic
give me a fact check on that would you
agree that people's opinions of mail-in
ballots
are now divorced from the pandemic it's
sort of a separate category i think by
itself
because there are plenty of reasons to
have mail-in ballots or plenty of
reasons to dislike them right you could
go either way but it has nothing to do
with the pandemic at this point it did
but at this point i think we're past
that i think just it's a question about
ballast themselves
all right
um yeah there's a lot to be needs to be
fixed in the election there's no doubt
about that
somebody says they lost the video but i
don't think that's true
um
here's what i would say i don't believe
there's anybody who wants to give power
uh at least in terms of the masks and
the lockdowns
that part
if it's all about the mail-in ballots
then i i acknowledge that point
could be
yeah
certainly there are people who would
prefer a good reason for mail-in ballots
if they're democrats that makes sense
so i'll agree with you that that far
that it's opportunistic
all right let's talk about the arizona
audit i tried to find a good reliable
news source to
to help me understand
um
whether the arizona ought to have found
nothing or something
because it you know as i predicted it
broke into these two movies
and
so i was trying to figure out what did
the audit find
in terms of what did they verifies true
and what things did could they not find
because they couldn't check them
and so here's the best summary that i
got right
now keep in mind my number one rule of
knowing what is fake news and what is
not is it's real news if it's reported
the same
on both networks
meaning fox and cnn so that's my
standard now i'm not going to say it
works every time
but it's a pretty good starting point
for identifying fake news which is that
if if the two networks are reporting it
differently
there's something going on
right one of them is giving you fake
news at least maybe both
if they both report it the same
it's probably true
probably true if they report it the same
did fox news and cnn report the arizona
results about the same
i think they did
i think they did and neither of them
seem to say that any fraud was found
with any certainty
all right but let's talk about the what
they did find and what they did not find
so when they counted the ballots they
they didn't find a big problem with the
actual ballots so here's where you check
your belief system
was there any point at which you
personally you i'm looking at you
believed that there were
ballots that were made with strange
chinese paper bamboo paper
how many of you believe that some of
those ballots would be made of bamboo
because there weren't
there weren't any bamboo ballots
if you ever believed that there were
bamboo paper ballots
then
just do a little check on yourself oh i
got that one wrong now
let me be clear
i guess stuff wrong
you get stuff wrong we all get stuff
wrong doesn't mean you're bad people
right
in fact i would argue that the attitude
you should take when you find out you're
wrong about something like that is uh
elation
why should you be happy to find out you
were so wrong
because you're smarter now
it made you smarter if you find out that
you were wrong about something
fundamental that you believed
the moment you found out you're wrong
you got smarter
right you went from wrong to right
shouldn't that make you happy
why would you not be happy
to just become obviously smarter
well you know your ego says oh i don't
want to ever know that i was wrong in
the past but i think you should maybe
look at this a little more
optimistically
if somebody proves you wrong you just
got smarter
permanently
you'll always be smarter about whatever
that thing was and maybe even learn
something
so if you ever thought that there were
bamboo paper ballots
just just put a little check on that
box
for your personal record
so you know that sometimes you can be
wrong about stuff like that it will
keep you honest
um apparently there weren't any fake
ballots there weren't any sharpies there
weren't any strange things about the
counting so all of the things that you
thought about the physical ballots
seems to been
ruled out by the people on your team
if you were on the same team as the
cyber ninjas who did the audit
so i would say most of the ordinary ways
that we imagine people could have been
faking stuff was ruled out
how many how many of you agree with just
that very minor claim
that the physical ballots
the ninja
auditors they they ruled that out as a
source of the fraud do you agree
that just that narrow little area they
did rule out as fraud
and that they ruled that they were
counted correctly roughly
not enough to change the
okay so
how many of you thought that within that
ballot counting
domain there would definitely be a big
problem
there wasn't
how many of you predicted there would be
i didn't
i mean i didn't have a prediction one
way or the other but i didn't assume
that it was wrong um
all right so then what things are not
counted and why is it that uh on the war
room
with steve bannon and
uh why is it they're saying there are 57
000 illegal ballots
or at least 57 ballot 57 000 ballots
that could be a problem remember trump
only lost by over 10 000 votes so if
there are 57 questionable votes and the
margin was only you know less than 11
000
big problem right
so
what about these 57 000 votes what do we
know about them well let's look at them
so they seem to fall into a
certain category
do you know what the larger category is
i'll read the subcategories
to tell you where these problems were
and then see if you could find use your
pattern recognition to find
where the large problem is all right
mail embellish voted from prior
addresses 23 000
votes from seemingly the wrong address
votes in multiple counties
uh
more ballots returned than issued
more ballots returned than issued
more duplicates than original ballots
more duplicates than original ballots
um
in-person voters who moved down to the
county
2.3 000 them right so the various
numbers on these were 10 000 voted in
multiple counties
9 000 more ballots returned than issued
blah blah okay
what do all of these things have in
common
they're based on comparing what you know
to another database
right
so all of these have the same thing in
common
you're comparing what you found in the
audit
to some other database and finding that
they don't match true true or false
that they're all in the same category of
audit found one number
they compare it to a database
and it's and it doesn't match
here's the problem
the databases that they're comparing it
to are not
not believed to be necessarily accurate
so they're not comparing it to anything
that's a standard for truth
they all have that same problem
that we don't know if the data you're
comparing it to is accurate there's no
way to know because there's no way to
compare that data
that data isn't compared to anything
so
if you're comparing it to something that
you don't know is right in the first
place
the databases that are probably
questionable to begin with
then you've got a problem now um
i guess the experts now are saying that
fraud is suggested in numerous instances
fraud is suggested in numerous instances
meaning
that the opportunity for fraud exists
so did we have an audit
did an audit happen
no
no there was no audit
there was somebody who got paid to do
something that has the word audit in it
and they did look at some subset of
things that could could have gone wrong
and they did find that that subset of
things they looked at
didn't seem to be the problem
but it sure wasn't an audit
an audit would find problems i mean it
would find all the places that there
could be a problem but a partial audit
is worse than
no audit
what could be worse than a partial audit
if the things that you checked are the
places that the fraud doesn't exist
the worst thing you can do is do an
audit of the place that where the fraud
isn't
because then you'll convince yourself
there's no fraud
but you haven't even really checked
so that's what we got the worst case
scenario
an audit that could only check the
things
that probably were not the problem in
the first place
so
here's what i would do i was probably
support for president any candidate who
said they were going to fix this
make the election auditable
that's it
do i care about this can this
hypothetical candidate's uh fiscal
policy
nope
nope
do i care about this candidate's uh
international policy
nope
if you want to turn me into a
single-issue voter this is how
just fix the election systems so that we
can audit them and at the very least you
can check your vote to make it sure it
made it all the way through
there must be some way to do it i
realize there's an issue with you know
anonymity but there's got to be a way to
do it right it can't be impossible so
um yeah this system isn't going to fix
itself right so i would vote i i could
give a full-throated support to trump if
he said look
i've got questions about the election
i think it was fraudulent
we can't find out because we don't have
a way to check elections
what i'll do
is i'll make sure that the states are
forced to create systems that can be
audited instantly
i think the federal government could do
that right set up a standard that says
states you can do whatever you want in
terms of a lot of the details but why
you can't
what you can't avoid is it has to be
auditable
it has to be auditable all the way
through or else you can't have that
system
i feel like the federal government could
make the states do that right it might
be a constitutional issue
somebody can weigh in on that
we already have the fec well apparently
the fec is not making elections
auditable
i'm i'm not saying make them fair
i'm saying make them auditable
that's very different
because if you make them auditable
they'll end up being fair
all right
so now do the 49 other states right
so we don't know what any other state
looks like but
we do know what one looks like
and we certainly should audit as much as
we can audit
all right
um
uh
okay canadians apparently are a little
too trusting
you've heard the canadians are nice are
there any canadians watching right now
i think you can uh
you can confirm for me
canadians
very nice very nice people
um
but i'm wondering if what comes along
with that is a little bit too much of
trust
because because they kind of travel
together right being nice and being
trusting they kind of travel together
but 80 percent of canadians consider
online information reliable
what
what
what
80 percent of canadians consider online
information reliable
do you know where i got this statistic
online
this is probably not even true
but if it is true it'd be funny
and 66 percent of canadians are
confident they can tell when it's not
so two-thirds of canadians think they
can look at the online news and know
when it's true and when it's not
oh canada
oh canada
oh oh canada
that's all i'm going to say about that
and apparently that the minister of
something
up there has proposed concrete action to
police the news and information on the
internet good luck with that
good luck with that
well rasmussen has poles says uh
uh it was asking if the radical left is
using the pandemic as a trojan horse
for permanent socialism and biden is
either powerless to stop them
or doesn't want to
how many people agree with that that the
radical left is using the pandemic as a
trojan horse
to permanently give us socialism
and biden can't stop it or he likes it
59 agree
uh strongly or somewhat
59
of the freaking country
or at least the people who answered this
poll
uh
think that the left the radical left is
using it as a trojan horse for permanent
socialism
well how's your infrastructure bill
looking now
remember i told you when did i tell you
that the infrastructure bill would never
get passed
one of my best
predictions so far
now
yeah and how many times have we seen the
news ah we're there now
big big progress
big progress in the infrastructure bill
because you know somebody agreed or
somebody negotiated this
and i just look at this thing no
no
maybe never
maybe never i mean you know maybe they
could knock it down to a trillion and
get it through or something but i don't
think the 3.5
has any chance does it
uh
all right
um
anyway
that
is what i wanted to talk about today
have i missed anything
was there a uh there's an earthquake in
greece
well i'm glad i'm not there
because i was
yeah and you've got your joe mansions
and your
your kristen cinemas and stuff
all right so
i attempted to not curse
and to not talk about the
you know the
too much about coronavirus except
whether you thought it was a conspiracy
theory
um
did i use the s word i don't think i did
did i
oh did i say did i swear
did i use the s word i'm saying in the
comments that i did
i guess i didn't even know that oh when
my phone message came on
that doesn't count does that count
okay well apparently it's a work in
progress apparently apparently i can't
apparently i'm not good at not swearing
what are my thoughts on sympathy between
political parties i don't i don't know
what you mean exactly
yeah china's in big trouble that is
correct what did i tell you a few months
ago or maybe it was less
china's in big trouble
so they're uh
the real estate industry is collapsing
they're running out of energy
and uh
i think they got big trouble coming
uh musk is expanding business in china

option
probably not
will the regime collapse i don't know
regime's pretty strong
i don't know if the regime will collapse
but they got big big problems coming
thank you for tanking the real estate
market in china you're welcome

oh i'm just getting started
china's in big trouble
um

india no i'm not sure i believe anything
out of india

and that is all i got for now and what
happens to your consciousness when you
die well mine's going to go into
computer digital form but that's just me
biden freed the huawei lady really

i didn't say that story
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
