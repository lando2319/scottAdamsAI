[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization you
know sometimes I say that and you think
it's Hy probably but today is real this
will be the best thing you ever saw in
your life no that's not a lot that's not
true it would be the second best thing
you ever heard second best thing we'll
talk about the first best thing later
but if you like to take this experience
up to levels which you can't even
understand with your tiny human brain
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass a tanker geler Stein a Ken jger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous hi
and happens now
go very good very good
I felt like when I was doing the
simultaneous sip thing I was talking
like uh SpongeBob a little bit or like
the beginning of the SpongeBob show
here's a tiny little bit of trivia for
you you know the voice of
SpongeBob uh Tom Kenny he was also the
voice of asuk the intern on my Dilbert
TV show that lasted two half
Seasons small world
anyway uh we have so much news and we're
going to get to the big news we're going
to talk about Mike Benz and we're going
to talk about Trump's legal stuff and
all that but have you seen the uh AI
from Gemini yet or the uh I think it's
Google's product
Gemini man I hear it's amazing has
anybody tried it
yet how many of you have tried
it because I hear it's
incredible yeah anyway I'll tell you why
I said that
later sometimes things are not what they
seem yeah sometimes things are not
exactly what they
see all right well uh there's a study
that says exercise is way more effective
than
anti-depressants uh almost twice as
effective more than twice as effective
so they actually now I thought this was
going to be backward
science I was already ready to say oh I
found another because I like to do
backward science stories where they they
get the correlation backwards and it's
sort of obvious it's like uh no I don't
think jail causes crime I think the
crime caused the jail you know that sort
of thing so as soon as I saw that uh the
people who exercised were in better
mental health than the people who didn't
I said to myself ah it's one of these
fake studies where obviously the real
correlation is that if you're sad you
don't exercise as much
you know obvious but it turns out they
may have done this one correctly in the
sense that they had a control group and
they did not just uh do a retrospective
study of how people already felt they
had a bunch that went on drugs and a
bunch that went on nothing but exercise
and they compared them and it wasn't
even
close now I'm going to add this to my
other category of story I call it should
have asked
Scott should have asked Scott
is there even one time you ever went for
a walk on a nice day and you didn't feel
better when you were done even
once oh think so I I feel like we all
feel that like it's just as clear as you
could possibly feel it that your mental
health is absolutely positively
influenced by your exercise and going
outdoors and if you exercise out doors
even
better now I do wonder if this study was
compromised by the fact that the people
were exercising in many cases Outdoors
because then you wonder wait was it the
outdoors part because when you take
pills you're indoors usually when you
exercise you're Outdoors so did they
really study exercise or did they
accidentally study going
Outdoors well should have asked Scott
they're both good going Outdoors
absolutely is going to help your mental
health exercise 100% is going to help
your me your mental health do I care if
this study was a little mixed up and
maybe you don't know if it was the going
Outdoors or the exercise I don't care do
both of those
things speaking of Health Elon Musk
weighed in on the question of hormonal
birth control and he post to this
hormonal birth control makes you fat
doubles risk of depression and triples
risk of
suicide and he says this is clear
scientific consens census but very few
people seem to know it h you know how
you could have known that you could have
asked me even without the science do you
know how I knew I've observed
it how many of you have observed this
directly that you saw somebody go on
birth control and everything
changed yeah you've observed it
directly um Ashley stclair has a you
know a story anecdotal story now we
don't want to make too much of an
anecdotal story but I've heard the same
anecdotal story enough times that how in
the world could it not change your
mentality or your your mental health if
they change your hormones how could it
not I I'm seeing in the comments
apologies to two
ex-husbands perhaps so perhaps so now I
don't blame any woman who's on um
birth control because you know the
entire Health Community is telling you
to do it so I think this is probably one
of the biggest
um abuses of Health Care maybe equal to
the um the vaccinations maybe equal to
covid and maybe as big as the poisoning
of our food supply see it's becoming
more and more clear that the entities we
thought were helping us stay safe are
exactly the entities that are making
money by not making us
safe it seems obvious now doesn't it and
I also at this whole birth control thing
if you assume that is true that would
give men two choices for
relationships one a woman who's having
Mental Health crisis and uh doesn't find
you attractive anymore because when you
you take the birth control of changes
who you think is attractive so that's a
losing proposition or you could be with
a woman who's not on birth control and
you could have a high risk of having a
unwanted
pregnancy and maybe your life would be
completely altered maybe for the good
but completely altered by that
experience those are two bad choices are
they not uh I used to think that there
was a good choice like when I was young
and I thought the pill was as safe as
anything I thought it was all tested and
I thought oh there's a safe Choice as
long as you're with the woman who's on
birth
control you know if you got tested for
the other stuff not really much risk but
it turns out there is no risk-free way
for a young single man to be with a
young single woman there's no way to do
it without an unsafe
risk like literally there's no way to do
it so what would you predict from a situ
situation in which there's no safe way
for a young man to be with a young
woman it's exactly what you'd expect
you'd expect the birth you'd expect
marriage to be plummeting you'd expect
uh The Unwanted pregnancies of single
women with no guy in their life to be
through the roof you'd expect a mental
health you know crisis because the maybe
the
hormones it's exactly what you'd
expect all right Sam mman you know him
from chat GP CEO of that company and Sam
was explaining in some event about
success he said the most underrated
quality is being really determined this
is more important than being smart
having a network or a great
idea that sound uh pretty wise me
obviously he knows how success works
because he's super successful he knows a
lot of super successful people so it's
not about being smart it's about you
know the determination more than other
things Follow Your Passion now I hate to
break it to you but today is going to be
all about destroying all your Illusions
oh I got a few illusions that you're GNA
you're going to lose today here's the
first illusion you're going to lose the
reason that smart successful people tell
you that brains are not important is so
you don't kill them and take their stuff
that's why because if Sam mman got up
there and said you know the honestly the
secret to success is I was just born
smarter than you and the reason I work
so hard is because being as smart as I
am I know I'm working on the right
things because I'm smart and also I have
a really good chance that they'll work
out because I'm really smart and you put
all those things together and it really
makes sense to work really smart to
change the world because I'm
smart right right the the alpha variable
is
genius if Elon Musk tells you that the
reason he's successful is because he
slept under his desk and worked all
night well that's certainly part of it
you know it's a big part of the
motivation getting everybody else on
board Focus it's
important but he's the richest person in
the world because he's a
genius the other the other stuff he was
lucky that you know he could also either
produce or uh he had them but it's the
genius first by
far so uh don't be fooled by people who
tell you it's nothing but determination
you do have to have the determination
but knowing when to quit is important
and having a talent stack is important
so if you can't be born a genius you can
fake it there's a way to fake it if you
combine enough talents you know you just
learn how to do stuff and they fit
together well you can effectively be a
genius with an average IQ because nobody
else would have your certain specific
combination of skills so that you know
there there's lots of ways to do that
but you can basically fake being a
genius you can also fake luck do you not
of fake luck because obviously luck you
can't directly change you go where
there's more of it
so I grew up in a Tiny Town in which
there were there were you know very few
opportunities so the first thing I did
is moved to San Francisco when I got out
of
college because there was a ton of stuff
happening in the Bay Area there was just
so much energy that that luck was all
over the place you could just grab some
as it went by so no uh luck is
completely manageable genius is a little
bit manageable by combining Talent B to
make you the special one in the room and
determination is also
manageable because if you know how
success works and you put together all
the parts the determination comes a
little bit almost automatically do you
know what will make you work really hard
so I say to you hey I got an idea if you
work for 20 24 hours straight without
sleep no sleep 24 hours straight I'll
give you a billion dollars and you say
what am I working on you go digging a
ditch like it's going to be hard 24
hours you going to be you're going to
have calluses no blisters not even
calluses you have blisters every part of
you will hurt and you go but I'm going
to get a billion dollars when I'm done
right right right how many of you could
dig a ditch for 24 hours if you if you
knew for sure you get a billion dollars
every one of you determination is free
let me say that again
determination is
free it comes with the other stuff you
do everything else right and you'll
you'll pound through a wall because you
know that as soon as you're done with
pounding through the wall Treasure
Chest so be careful about the advice of
uh successful people they may not know
exactly why they're successful
themselves that's common but they may
not be able to explain it to you as
honestly as they
should uh Ryan fornier reports on the
xplatform that uh San Francisco just
appointed someone to their San Francisco
elections
commission and that by itself wouldn't
be much news would it it's a San
Francisco elections committee so it's
the uh this commission figures out the
policies for
elections so who did they put on the
elections commission to do the policies
for elections let's see checking
notes um someone who can't legally vote
someone who's not a
citizen that that's really
happening now this would be the place
where I put my brilliant commentary on
top of the
news not
necessary nope nope I'm just going to
let this one just sit there you can do
it yourself put your own commentary on
this one it's a story just does it all
by itself anyway here's one of my here's
my favorite positive story of the day
we'll get to the negative stuff
later um off of Honduras in Central
America there's a little
island
and um some
entrepreneurs uh are well on the way to
building I guess it's already partly
built or half built or mostly built it's
called
prospera and it's on the island of
ratan and if you want to buy something
there you got to use
crypto and they've got a bunch of
startups and uh biotech and
Robotics and apparently they're just
trying to build a city from scratch in
which everything is just done
right how much do you like
that couple of the visitors who went
there to speak recently were Balaji
nasan B
rabant do you remember I told
you um that if you know what's happening
you don't know
anything if you know who you know
everything so if you don't know who uh B
Balaji shavasan and Naval ravikant are
basically two smartest people in the
world so if they went both went there to
visit both had a positive experience
from it
keep an eye on this just keep an eye on
this trust
me uh I've been telling you for a long
time that in my opinion the biggest
economic driver of the future besides
robots I suppose um is going to be
building cities from
scratch and when I saw about this city I
said to myself hey maybe I found my
second home or my Escape home or the
place I could go that doesn't
suck now uh if you want to go there um I
would suggest that you bring your own
woman because there's no indication that
any female is anywhere and has been
anywhere near that
island so so there there may be one flaw
there might just be one flaw in the
plan I don't think there are any women
there now I'm joking I'm sure there are
but uh I would I'd be a little bit
careful of who the island attracts in
the first wave because it's going to be
yeah
nerdtopia um and I think it'll be
awesome in the long run but you're going
to have to get some women there that's
somewhat necessary for the old
civilization
thing all right uh now the real the real
uh thing that might make a difference is
that if you build this uh City that's on
an island that's hard to get
to um you may have escaped the Dei
problem so they may have built a
civilization that operates on
Merit and they wouldn't have to worry
about all the Dei stuff because they're
in a different country and nobody no
homeless people are going to walk over
there poor people can't get to it if
they
tried so they may have found a
workaround to get around the Dei
trap speaking of that
um you you've probably heard this story
before but it's just it's just worth
mention again did you hear about the
Harvard Professor he was an economist
and in 2016 he published a study to find
out about uh police shooting of black
citizens versus white and he was an
economics professor Roland
frier and he did find that uh police
were more than twice as likely to
manhandle or or beat up um black and
Hispanics when they stopped him but
uh they were less likely to shoot
blacks than whites a lot less likely as
in 24% less likely like a
lot and apparently when that happened
the entire world blew up and he was so
at risk he had to get
security because apparently the truth is
really really
dangerous so I put that there just as
another
example of uh the truth is dangerous so
we can't have any of it now I wanted to
uh I've been showing you some fun
examples of what I call liar
face now just to review liar face is
what Liars do when they know they're
lying so this is not you don't do this
if you are just deluded or you have TDS
this is when you know you're lying and
the tell is your eyes go wide during the
during the
lie and your mouth for a moment your
mouth doesn't seem to match the
eyes that's the tell
now I'm going to show you a picture of
someone you'd
recognize and I want you to say does his
face always look like that or is or is
he in the middle of a
lie all right I'll show it first the
locals
platform all right thises it look at the
eyes is that the way his eyes normally
look all right hear you guys do his eyes
normally look like
that no he was right in the middle of a
lie uh this is a number of years ago in
which he was explaining that Trump was
crazy to imagine the government was
spying on
him this this is mid lie I actually
caught the video the moment he was
telling you that Trump was not being
spied on now have you seen enough
examples yet liar face is a real
thing
you you all know because I say it too
often I'm a trained
hypnotist when you when you trained as a
hypnotist one of the skills you learn is
to look for micro changes and faces so
you're just studying you're studying
faces all the time to watch you know the
eyes don't match the mouth and you know
if there's a skin tone change or there's
you get flush you know any micro changes
you're always looking for and that tells
you if the hynosis is working basically
but the the uh sort of related skill you
pick up is you can identify Liars with a
Precision that's just crazy now only if
they haven't practiced too much if if
they're talking off the cuff you can you
can see it every time but if they
practiced you know like a car dealer the
car dealership you're not going to see
the LIE the eyes aren't going to open
probably because they're too
practiced so that's called liar
face so let's talk about the uh the
uh uh the the legal case against
Trump that doesn't even narrow it down
does it there's so many legal cases
against Trump I honestly can't keep them
straight they all look a little bit
similar to me however this latest one I
think I have it right this is uh judge
uh Doby the house elf I believe that's
his name Dobby the house Dobby the house
he so he's a judge in New York and he
decided that uh
Trump uh is just a terrible man a
terrible man and uh all of his many many
Financial uh corruption problems are so
bad that he had to find him uh 100
gazillion bazillion trillion
dollars I'm rounding off because there's
going to be some interest involved so
gazillion bazillion trillion dollars and
uh also Eric Trump and uh his brother
they're going to owe some money because
I don't know just because they're
related and they remind you of trump or
something I don't know what the answer
reasons are basically all the reasons
that come out of the judge and the trial
are all you know that right you
know it's we broke it into two complete
movies again the movie I'm watching I
saw a complete Corruption of Justice I
saw a corrupt judge in a corrupt system
uh handing down a judgment that would
never happen to any other person that's
what I saw in my movie here's what the
uh here's what MSNBC is telling you with
their eyes really wide
open they're telling you that uh there
are so many Financial Corruptions
involved in this case are there I
thought it was just a difference about
the value of something and that never
really matters because the bank always
checks on their own it's just sort of
standard business anyway but according
to MSNBC there are so many uh violations
of financial law involved
here I didn't see any but there's so
many according to them that if you
allowed Trump not to be
punished do you know what that could
lead to it could lead to a lack of
credibility in the financial system do
you know what that could lead to a the
crumbling of civilization itself do you
know what that could lead to
cannibalism
cannibalism so the MSNBC take is that if
you allow a bank to make a lot of money
giving a loan to
Trump but his estimate of the value of
his properties was wildly different than
the banks and of course the bank checks
themselves that's their normal way the
business they never ever ever not once
take the word of the applicant for the
loan has never happened in the history
of bank loans won't do it once didn't do
it this time never ever they check or
they look at a document that they
trust
and so so this is what would happened uh
because the bank made a lot of money and
they're very happy about the transaction
and Trump if he's not seriously punished
by having toay pay a gazillion trillion
bazillion zillion gazillion dollars if
they don't make him do that then he
could do this
again you know right now even while I'm
talking uh he might be overvaluing an
asset right
now that could be
happening I mean imagine if he
overvalues an asset while banks are
happy and making money from him and he's
got his loan that he's paying on time
well just the fact that he's overvalued
those assets and could do it again is
going to destroy the financial
credibility of our system which in turn
destroys civilization itself which in
turn leads to
cannibalism so if you walk cannibalism
you
 well then you should be in
favor of this being
overturned but if you want to be good
people good people the kind that watch
snbc and think it's
real well then you would want Trump to
pay a fine of one gazillion trillion
failon
dollars because that's how you protect
the
system um Elon Musk as asked a question
which I should know the answer to but I
don't he said on a post uh who is Trump
supposed to pay given that there were no
victims
wait what wait it's a
lawsuit which means that somebody was
grieved so the bad person pay his money
to
compensate hold on to
compensate for the
victims but the victims made $100
million
huh it's almost as if the entire thing
is
almost I'm starting to think it's all
 but we can tell it's not I mean
you know don't don't imagine that our
our justice system is corrupt come on
you guys you know the justice system is
not corrupt let's listen to some of the
things that the judge
said uh the judge said that Trump had a
complete lack of Contrition and remorse
for making that bank a $100 million and
paying off his Lo loan on time and that
it borders on the pathological that he
wouldn't believe the illegitimate
corrupt uh justice system was doing a
good job to help the country um and that
they're uh and that uh even though Trump
is not Bernie maid off you know he's not
that bad didn't kill anybody they are
incapable of admitting the errors of of
their
ways they're
incapable you know if Trump will not
admit that Mar Lago is only worth $18
million well let me let me explain this
to
you if Trump doesn't agree with the
judge's
estimate that marago which is clearly
worth over $100 million if he doesn't
agree with the obvious fake fact that
100% of The Observers know is a fake
fact
if he doesn't agree with what is not
true that's a sign that he's incapable
of admitting the error of his
ways and because he can't admit that the
thing that we all know is not true and
has been proven not to be true and the
court showed is not to be true that
because he can't admit
that he must pay because otherwise the
financial system will crumble
civilization will
crumble cannibalism
you understand I mean it all just
follows now I'm being a little bit um
team player here the other issue is that
apparently Trump would not admit that
his um Penthouse was
33,000 or no it was 11,000 square feet
not
33,000 now my guess is that he thought
it was
33,000 have you ever had anybody ask you
about the size of something like your
house or something and you give them a
wrong number and then later you're like
oh it's not that's not that it's
actually a different number I've done
that a million
times it's very common you actually
remember something but you just
remembered it
wrong my guess is that whether the P my
guess is that whether the penthouse was
11,000 square feet or
33,000 it was probably worth the same
amount either way and either way they
were going to check and he knew they
were going to check so you wouldn't tell
that kind of a lie to somebody who's
going to
jack don't the public records tell you
the size of it sometimes they actually
send somebody over to to measure it
they'll literally send somebody with a
you know a measuring device just to see
if it really
is so that seems to be a complete
Corruption of Justice I wonder if
there's any larger context in which we
could understand this legal case huh
I
wonder uh we'll get to that and
um what I'm wondering is I my
understanding is that even though Trump
is going to appeal and I would expect to
get thrown out an appeal because it's so
 stupid um I think that he's
supposed to pay her
first now need that's my understanding
he has to pay her first and then he can
appeal and if he wins he gets it
back from whom I don't I don't know does
it go into escrow or something and it
just Waits until they see if it's real
and then where would it Go does it go to
the
government I don't I don't even know
so um I've got a suggestion if Trump is
short on cash and I imagine he would now
one way is to to declare
bankruptcy but people don't understand
bankruptcy they would just say he's bad
at business and he's a crook so you
don't want to have that on your record
even even though he's done it before by
the way he's had some bankruptcies
before I think um but you don't want to
do that because it's just a bad look
especially when you're running for
president so if he needs the cash to pay
off this enormous fine which is uh 10
trillion gazillion Fillion Fillion
dollars then I think he should get a
bank
loan because my understanding is the
banks are really eager to do business
with him because he's a really good
customer so maybe deuts bank would float
him a loan so he could pay off these
penalties what why are you laughing
that's where you go to get
money you go to a money the banks or
where you go to borrow money when you
need money if you have a temporary cash
flow
problem where are you going to
go was there some other way to do
it how do big companies uh act when they
need a big loan they go to a bank you
know it's it's not something you would
do with uh issuing stock you know you
don't want to issue stock to do it you
go to a loan or go to a bank so I think
you should uh go right back to deuts
bank they're quite happy with them and
uh get himself a loan to pay off the uh
thing and he should declare that his
Penthouse is 33 Square 3 33,000 square
feet just for fun
anyway um there's some indication there
might be the beginning of what could be
a trucker revolt on New York City um I
don't know how big this is but I saw one
trucker saying that a number of truckers
were going to refuse loads to New York
City now I don't know much about the
trucking industry but can an individual
operator say no to a specific route and
a specific load or do they all have
bosses if they all have bosses they
can't do
it I'm seeing a lot of yeses they must
be independent contractors who who take
take loads on demand is that what
happens so they could they could
literally say I just won't go to New
York they could just say there's enough
there's enough business I'll just do do
other
business and somebody speculated I saw
online that you wouldn't have to stop
all deliveries to New York to make a
dent 10% would give them a lot of
trouble yeah 10% would be a big big
problem do I think that New York City
should be
crashed um because of this hearing yeah
absolutely that that would be entirely
appropriate citizen response I think
that if New York City can't act like a
civilized Place civilized people
shouldn't go there if New York
City doesn't have a Department of
Justice if you're going to let crime run
wild on the streets and if you're going
to try to uh ruin uh a presidential
candidate for purely political reasons
obviously no you don't get
food you don't get
food get your own
food all right so that might happen I
doubt you're going to see a truck or
revolt on New York City but it
might have you all seen the AI called
sora from chat GPT so it allows you to
write some text and it turns it into a
little
movie well a lot of people are saying
it's not just going to be the cool new
thing it does but it's going to
change Humanity
because you can text into a perfect film
now it takes a while to think about that
before you can see how that could change
Humanity but imagine if you will that
anybody can create a photo realistic
engaging video that's not
real and that that will be so well done
you'll prefer them over
reality and imagine a world in which
you're seeing things visually that
didn't
happen now let's compare suppose you
said I think uh Trump did a bad thing
whatever it is now that's you know he
said she said you just you know one team
believes it's true the other doesn't but
it's just
words now some now imagine somebody
speaks those words into Ai and then AI
creates the movie where it puts the
person you're accusing in the scene
and shows them doing the crime that
never
happened if you see a photorealistic
crime on video sounds like looks like is
exactly like the real person let's say
Trump are you ever going to be convinced
it didn't happen nope because your
visual senses overwhelm your other
senses they're they're the boss of your
brain your visual sense is your truth
and everything else is just fighting for
you know little space the truth is what
you see so if somebody creates a fake
truth and just puts it in front of you
it doesn't matter if it says this was
made by AI it didn't really happen it's
still going to become your
truth because your eyes create your
truth and we can't turn that off you
don't you don't have enough rational
brain to say I know that's AI nope yeah
some of you will in some cases of course
there'll be there'll be some of you can
reject it but mostly because you're on
the other team if you were on the team
that was primed to believe that Trump
would eat a baby and you saw a video
that showed him eating a baby like just
sticking a fork into a
baby half of them would believe it just
because they' be primed and then it
becomes part of their permanent belief
system because there's a visual to go
along with it yeah I do agree that when
you can make any visual as compelling as
real ity and anybody can do it it's not
limited to a movie production company
working for two years to produce it and
you all know it's a movie because you
went to a theater to see
it we don't know what's ahead we really
really don't know what's coming couldn't
be good could be bad could be just a
challenge but wow it's going to be
exciting um did you see uh van Jones on
Bill Maher and uh h
um and he was with Anne cter you you
have to watch the clips if you haven't
seen them because they're talking about
some some shooting and bill marah says
we don't we don't know who did it and
then Coulter just says sort of a low
under breath well we know a little bit
about it and then they say what are you
talking about and Van Jones is sitting
next to an cter as she's explaining what
she means she goes well we know they
didn't tell us anything about the
shooters so that means it uh that means
it's not
white then she gave some examples to
make her point and you should see van
Jones face when she's saying this right
next to him because he knows it's true
but he also knows that the audience
might have a different reaction so he
gets this this face
like like like he didn't I think his
face didn't know what to do because
typically people not confronted with
truth right in front of them like if
you're on CNN you don't even see anybody
talking anything that's true right in
front of you like you see it on TV and
stuff but nobody's sitting next to you
telling you something that's obvious and
true so that was funny and then van
Jones uh had a narrative he was pushing
the Democrat narrative this is wonderful
that Trump is the reason the border is
open just hold that in your head
that the Democrat
narrative and Van Jones who knows better
he knows better right he's not
hypnotized like the others he knows
better he's saying that the reason that
Trump is to blame is that they had that
excellent border bill that would have
certainly made things different and uh
because Trump was against it the
Republicans were against it too because
they want to make him happy and
therefore Trump is the reason the
borders wide
open now everybody who's not in the
hypnotized Camp you know the the the
poor bastards watching MSNBC and CNN and
the mainstream media every one of the
people watching this knows that the
Border bill was a fake right is there
anybody who doesn't know that I would
say 100% of the people watching this
live stream now are completely aware
that the Border bill was a fake I don't
need to go into the details it wasn't
trying to close the border and so with
or without that Bill had nothing to do
with the Border
it basically it was going to process
them
faster it was basically a nothing in
terms of closing the
border so um that's
interesting um but if you really want
some fun I I reposted this this morning
so you can find it in my feed so uh
somebody named Jay
Stewart compiled 10 clips of Bill Mah
not understanding anything about
anything
and when you see him all together it's
really shocking and what it is is you
can tell he's been poisoned by the
mainstream media narratives and there
there entire entire topics that are just
really Central to understand of the news
they never heard of and when you see
them all together it's like oh my
 God oh my God there's so
much that's obvious and true that he's
never never seen never even heard of I
think MK Ultra was
one never heard of
it imagine how would you understand the
world you I mean just really basic
stuff all right
um uh I've got a question for you uh I
want you to tell me if this is an
example of hate speech or a really funny
joke now I'm not giving you this because
I think it's is funny because it might
just be ha speech so we're we're
speaking of this not as humor which
would be I think UNC and uncalled for so
if I can ask all of you to be on your
best behavior to be kind to people and
simply judge whether this is an
hilarious comment or a hate speech which
would be terrible because I don't want
any of that right and it's a a comment
uh on uh Admiral Rachel
LaVine uh you know Admiral Rachel LaVine
she's she's
trans and was said on video The Other
Day quote climate change is having a
disproportionate effect on black
communities now Seth Dylan who's the CEO
of the Babylon b a satirical site had a
comment and this is what I'm going to
ask you I I just want your opinion is
this a hate speech
or the funniest thing you've heard
today and I just think it's it's
terrible personally I think it's
terrible but I want to see what you say
so after Admiral Rachel LaVine said
climate change is having a
disproportionate effect on black
communities Seth Dylan posted man
dressed as woman says weather is
racist no that's not funny oh you
bastards oh you're you're terrible so of
you are laughing at that like it's a
joke come on come on grow
up well I'm disgusted with all of you
and and I've lost all respect I've lost
all
respect so can you join me in condemning
Seth Dylan and the entire Babylon B for
imagining that there's any humor to be
found in this situation no there's not
it's not funny and we will not put up
with
it next story
Ezra Klein who's a columnist for the New
York Times which is important to the
story uh he has a podcast and he called
on President Biden to uh to bow out and
go on a
hero I I don't have to add the jokes
anymore do I I feel like my entire role
has been taken from me like I used to
like here's the news now what what I do
with it watch me take this news and turn
it into a
joke now I'm like I could be replaced by
a
toaster yeah he wants uh who wants Biden
to go out of
hero I have nothing to say about that I
have no what am I going to add to that
you can't get any
funnier but it's happening all right
uh Michael shellenberger and Matt taibi
are beond a bombshell new report that
says that can you believe this I know
you're all going to be shocked by
this because you didn't know I mean this
is something you couldn't have possibly
known was happening in reality behind
the scenes see if this shocks
you bombshell report Russia didn't want
Trump to win in 2016 they wanted Hillary
and the CIA knew it and Obama's CIA
director John Brennan manufactured
evidence for the Russia
hoax and that there's a document that
people have seen that has been I guess a
whistleblower and the document is a
50-page thing that details their plot to
quote cook the intelligence until it
made it look like it was the opposite
and that Russia really wanted Trump to
win when in fact they were well aware
that Russia wanted Hillary to win
probably for the same reason that Putin
said he likes Biden because they're
traditional and
predictable
so now uh as Michael shellenberger said
he was on Jesse water show and
shellenberger says you probably think
this is an old Story how many of you
thought this that you already knew it it
was old story like before this week it
sounded familiar didn't it do you know
why you think it's an old
story because you knew it you
 knew it was
true yeah you knew it you didn't need
you didn't need a whistleblower you
didn't need confirmation it was kind of
obvious that the entire thing was a
hoax and that now the part that's new is
knowing that there might be an actual
document and knowing that was you know
clearly the head of the spear I think
that was obvious if you saw him on TV
and and that the CIA literally knew that
uh the Hillary was preferred by
Russia so just hold that in your head
for a moment all right I want you to
hold all the stories I've told so far in
your head because there's a there's a
climax coming in which is all going to
get tied together and you don't want to
leave before that it's good going to be
good all right next story that we're
going to tie all together in the end is
uh Wall Street Silver on X's is
reporting that
uh uh oh this is from uh let's see I
think this was from RFK Jr that uh even
if Ukraine war ends today there'll be
another half a trillion spent there
rebuilding the country and the US might
be
putting a lot of that money up so the
real expense might be in winning might
be more expensive to
win and who do you think's going to
build that H I wonder who would do all
that rebuilding the contracts to
Rebuilder are even bigger than the war
contracts says RFK Mitch McConnell was
asked in March if we could afford 113
billion for Ukraine he said don't worry
this is Mitch McConnell don't worry it's
not really going to Ukraine it's going
to US military
contractors and RFK JR says it's all
just a money laundering
scheme and that Ron General Dynamics
Boeing and locked Black Rock owns them
all by owning their
stock so Black Rock would be uh
rebuilding the country and rearming it
and making trillions of
dollars and RFK Jr
thinks that we're not there for
let's say strategic geopolitical reasons
but rather the entire thing is a fake
out and a Mone moneya laundering
operation does that sound true do you
think it's mostly a money operating
money you know I think it could be a
combination of a bunch of things I think
there are some people who you know
believe they're stopping Russia I think
there are other people who are
opportunistically saying well if we're
going to be fighting Russia anyway might
as well make some money and then there
are probably other people who literally
are pushing it just because they're
making money and don't really care about
how many people
die so it's probably not all one thing
it's probably a big mess of horribleness
all in one
place but um let me ask you
this if you're like me have you had a
bunch of mysteries about why things are
the way they are have you asked yourself
why is the Border
open have you asked yourself why is
Soros funding the things he's
funding like what's up with that like it
doesn't make sense and and have you
noticed that there's just a whole bunch
of things that feel different in the
last few years as if you can't tell
who's in charge have you noticed that
like you've got this Biden person that
you imagine is in the job that would be
in
charge but he's clearly
not so how do you explain all the
Mysteries turns out there's an answer to
all of
it there's an answer to all of it and
I'm going to recommend something uh the
strongest recommend recommendation I've
ever made on anything on any
topic th this is a must do this is
mandatory if you're GNA if you're going
to watch any more of my live streams
you have to watch mikee
Ben uh talking on Tucker show you can
only see it on X I believe or maybe
Tucker
site but Mike Benz
describes the answer to every
mystery in other words who's actually in
charge now I can't do the hard work of
explaining what he's going to explain
I'm going to I'll just hit some points
but know that just listening to me isn't
isn't going to get you there because you
have to see the entire tapestry to
understand it at all right I'll give you
just some of the highlights but trust
me take an hour off and sit there with
somebody you love or just a friend and
listen to it together and just watch
each other's heads expand and explode it
will feel like a mushroom
trip part of it is is that the
information is mindblowing and you know
well credible it's all
credible part of it is that Mike Ben
does the most extraordinary job of
communicating that you're ever going to
see in your life he talks almost he does
almost all the Talking for an hour and
you will be riveted and there will be no
no slow parts for one hour he will have
you just looking at it like with your
eyes open like
wait wh what wait what what and watch
watch Tucker's reaction throughout
throughout he's he's actually
stunned Tucker is stunned he can he
doesn't even know what to
say so I'll just give you a little bit
of a taste of it but you got to got to
absolutely have to watch it right it's
it's just not even it's not even
optional you got to watch it
so do that for me um and I'm not
exaggerating when I say it might be the
most entertaining thing I've ever
watched because it did feel like a
mushroom trip it was like an anal body
experience it was
that I'm all right you get the
idea here are some of the
things um if you go back in history um
here's some of the Mysteries that I've
wondered about do you ever wonder why
Google was so successful and Facebook
was so successful and you said to
yourself well you know got some
Geniuses well it might be and it seems
quite clear that the entire intention of
building up an internet
communication thing was so that the CIA
could control the news
everywhere so it's probably not a not a
uh mystery why companies like Google and
Facebook got so big so quickly it's
because the uh
CIA needed to create these tools to
control other countries because their
main job is overthrowing other countries
and the main way you do that the number
one way you do that is to control their
information if you can control their
information and the internet had to be
controlled then you can control them and
do color revolutions the color
Revolution is where you uh you you fund
some dissidents you can control the
media and then the media says the leader
is bad and then the the distant get
everybody else in because they don't
know it's being controlled by the CIA
they think it's organic so they join now
you got this fake organic people who
don't know that they were organized by
the CIA then you've got the fake news
telling them that they're right and then
it just plays out and it leavs the
revolution so these were tools that the
uh CIA was using primarily to take over
other countries and they had a a big
Network built to do that now here's one
of the things I learned which I had
predicted in my book the religion War
about 20 years ago so this was actually
a prediction in my
book apparently they
mapped
influence they created a map or a series
of maps so they could show what groups
or people were influencing what other
groups or people and the reason they did
that is they they know who to
suppress just hold that in your mind
they figured out who was the most
influential people and groups
online so they could suppress them that
was the point of
it yeah and of course they were doing
this with uh um foreign
countries and then a bad thing happened
and this is Mike Bon's telling he tells
it much better
in
2016
unexpectedly uh against 20 to1 odds
Trump
won and all the people who had built up
these capabilities to do these amazing
cyber things to other countries such as
Russia were out of a job and they had
all these skills for overthrowing
countries and suddenly they were told
that Trump is the Real
Enemy and that Trump might even be
working with Russia now did you ever
wonder why everything was Russia Russia
Russia this is why the people and the
tools that were anti-russia people were
were just uh repurposed into being
anti-trump people and the best way to do
that would to be to pretend he's really
Russia just say he's Russia he's working
with Russia Russia Embraces him Russia
is colluding with him so that whole
thing was made up because they had a
whole anti-russia
machine and people trained and so if
they could make it all one
thing they could you know control Trump
keep out of office now if you think it's
a Democrat thing it probably wasn't it
probably is a populist or an
anti-populist thing so as Mike Ben
speculates and I would agree that Bernie
Sanders would have been treated the same
as Trump so it wasn't about left or
right it was about populist versus
people they could
control the people they can control are
goingon to do stuff like take over
Ukraine Bernie wouldn't Trump wouldn't
so the things that they wanted to do who
are the people in
power they couldn't do with a trump or a
Bernie so it's not left or right it's
just no populists because populist stop
Wars
and so all of these people turned their
tools domestically but that's illegal
it's it's illegal so what did they do to
solve the problem that it would be
illegal to use these T these tools
domestically they changed
language because if you can change
language then the thing that was uh
illegal according to your language could
become legal simply because you changed
word
so in other words this whole domestic
terrorism of uh white supremacist and
domestic terrorism it was as fake as you
thought it was and the entire purpose of
it was to say that there's uh terrorism
inside the country so the external
facing tools which were now substantial
they had map they could map influence
and they could shut it down through the
control of the social media companies
and the mainstream media so they turned
inward made Trump the same as Russia
with a fake narrative the John breny
narrative and then they mapped the
influencers and then they suppressed
them people like
me people like me on YouTube right
now so I'm literally on YouTube right
now with an account that is growing in
all their ways except on YouTube YouTube
has me capped at about the same traffic
no matter my
topic with one exception do you know
what the exception was can you tell me
what was the one day my uh traffic on
YouTube was not seemingly seemingly
artificially
capped it was the day I got
cancelled yep so when I got cancelled my
traffic was you know I don't know 10
times and as soon as I stopped talking
about
that right back to Baseline none of
that's organic doesn't look like it so
there's one of those mysteries for you
the mystery was why does my traffic on
YouTube never go
up I mean I give you this quality
content every day should go
up Well turns out that uh YouTube is
part of Google Google is probably under
CIA control and always has been same as
the other uh social Medias except for x
and they have a map that they can tell
who is influential there's no way in the
world I'm not on that
map and so I'm being
suppressed in my own country for being
connected to
terrorism because in all likelihood some
of
you do some social media things that are
connected to something that somebody
would call terrorism domestic terrorism
you know because they can change
language not because it really
is so going on so once the uh machine
turned inward you could
see all of the tools that they were
using such as the justice
department do you see all the lawfare
against Trump and you say to yourself
hey that looks like a lot of
coincidences it's not
so the justice system is
corrupted by the cabal now in Mike Ben's
telling of it the uh Atlantic council is
the group that's sort of pulling the
strings for war and energy and the big
questions the GE the big geopolitical
stuff now he said that they're made up
of um seven ex heads of the
CIA I I did a little research I didn't
see that but is that a fact
is that
true uh I'll tell you some of the people
I did see on the list the Atlantic
Council uh we got the chairman and CEO
of
fizer hold on just process that the
group I say is running the world or Mike
Ben say and I'm agreeing with
him has a Advisory
Board and one of the people on it is the
chairman and CEO of
fiser the others on it are uh these are
just a few there's lots of them uh
former US chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff the former US Director of
National Intelligence guy named James
Clapper do remember do you remember
seeing Brennan and Clapper sitting next
to each other telling you that the
Russia collusion was real so so one of
the main Russia collusion guys is one of
the main guys on the Atlantic council
with a whole bunch of exmilitary and spy
people and CEOs of company like did I
mention
fizer yeah why is
fizer even in this
group how does it even make
sense does everything start to make
sense now everybody in this group is
making ton of money by doing
everything bad in the world everything
that you don't want to happen is coming
out of the same group
now here's another mystery what's up
with George
Soros have you ever wondered about that
what the hell's up with George Soros
because I can never understand why he
would be funding things that are clearly
destructive and now I
understand he's connected to the
Atlantic Council he's their Bank he uses
them to do stuff they can't do because
he can do it he's got money and he's got
these
organizations so now put it all together
the Atlantic Council
apparently is the the real power not
Biden and not Obama and not Hillary
Clinton it appears that they are
associated with this group but they're
not the heads of the snake it's probably
a loose you know bunch of people a cabal
of people who individually have power
but collectively they have interests
that's what it looks
like
and so now put it all together there's
the Atlantic Council
and they're they happily work with the
uh open Society Soros group Soros funded
a whole bunch of prosecutors in the
United States and you said why is he
funding prosecutors that are letting
criminals out of jail you couldn't
understand it right it was like a
mystery he lives in this country like
why would he want crime
everywhere now it's those same
prosecutors who are putting uh basically
taking Trump off the field or trying
to do you understand yet the letting
criminals on a jail part was never
important the controlling the courts was
the important part because now they have
people who put in jail any Republican
who causes
trouble like Trump so they can basically
jail any populist with the legal system
because the Atlantic Council works with
Soros Soros funds his prosecutors
prosecutors can put you in
jail a lot of mysteries are solved now
let's do another one how about the open
border have you been puzzled why there's
an open
border if I had to guess I would say the
Atlantic Council or the CIA who's
probably working with them probably are
just working with the
cartels that's probably the whole
reason I don't think there's any mystery
to it anymore because we know that could
close the border anytime they wanted to
right so it does seem that the Atlanta
Council and the CIA probably have some
mutual
interest might be Financial might be
power but it's pretty obvious that the
cartels could be closed down if the
people in power wanted that to happen so
that mystery feels solved to
me how about Dei do you ever wonder
about Dei you know another thing that's
got a lot of Soros
funding do you think that the Dei is to
make the world a nicer
place that's probably what a lot of
people working on it think it's about
you know what it's probably
about it's probably about creating
another weapon much like the
prosecutors so if they can't give you
for legal
reasons they can cancel you for being a
racist sound familiar
I think Dei is only a weapon to be used
against
populists the populists are the one who
say hey let's Protect America and that
might include closing borders and it
might include you know not being so uh
let's see be more uh meritocracy
oriented and less race
oriented so interestingly a thing that
doesn't make any sense for the health of
the country is a gigantic thing
and it's all connected back to weird
funding from a weapon that will
definitely take down a lot of populists
but is unlikely to take down any
Democrats right so do you remember how I
got cancelled the Washington Post was
the lead and everybody else just folded
after them the Washington Post is a
CIA
entity that does it surprise you at all
that I was cancelled so apparently this
this Big Blob can take out anybody
because they got a Dei tool they can
always accuse you of being racist then
then they have the entire media that
will support their
story so here are two things that
wouldn't work unless you also own the
media the these Soros prosecutors and
the laware they're doing against Trump
that would never work if the media were
on honest do you agree if the media were
honest even a little bit you couldn't do
that stuff not right in front of the
public but as long as the media can say
his financial crimes were so horrible
that it will destroy the financial
system possibly civilization itself and
then
cannibalism and if the media tells you
that and that's what MSNBC is saying
without the cannibalism um and
CNN then you think it's true and you
think these are uh perfectly
good uses of the Department of Justice
same with
Dei Dei is basically uh something that
the Press will support and it's just a
weapon so these things that don't make
sense to you they're
weapons they're weapons against
populists and that that it all makes
sense as soon as you see it everything
that was a mystery completely makes
sense
why do we have a president who is
obviously brain dead and is not being
removed by his own
party there's no mystery to that he's
not in charge the only thing American
president can do under our current
system is name post offices I guess
that's Congress but basically you know
the little domestic stuff nobody cares
about but if it comes to war or energy
or geopolitics
apparently the president's not in charge
it seems to be some loose cabal of uh
excia
people all right um and then why the war
in
Ukraine it's exactly what you think
because the same group of people found a
way to turn it into a piggy bank they
may have some problem with Russia as
well but uh yeah um the Atlanta
Council I'd like to mention one other
company they're none of the number of
companies that contribute too because
they they raised money for their
operation uh so I looked at the list of
contributors I found this company I
don't know if you've heard of this so
this is a contributor to the Atlantic
Council this is a company called
barisma has anybody heard of that one
it's called
bisma how's your
head yeah oh really yeah I just read it
this morning I didn't hear it from
somebody looked myself it's on their
official website it's on their website
there's a list a list of
donors so one of the members is the head
of fizer and is partly funded not that
much but is partly funded by barisma
lots of other entities as
well now let me ask you a hypothetical
question um I need a fact check on this
seven prior CIA people being at the
Atlanta Council I hope I got that that
right has anybody seen a confirmation of
that the seven xcia
heads I don't
know doesn't sound right do I am I
mixing up organizations do I have the
wrong
organization see the link
above youve seen it is there a Pacific
Council oh no Pacific Council okay
so I I can't apparently NATO works with
these guys anyway if I if I have the
organizations mixed
up you can correct it after the
show so no it's not the world economic
Forum anyway um if there's an entity
that has s xcia people on it plus the
heads of you know ex- heads of our
military um do you think that anybody is
the boss of them if if there is such an
organization that has all the ex- heads
of the CIA they don't have a
boss you get
that they don't have a boss because
nobody could be their
boss um well they might have somebody
who takes the lead on some things but no
they would not have a boss they would be
sort of
co-equals
so yeah definitely the president is not
in charge of the big stuff I think
that's obvious all
right let's see if these stories make
sense to you now CBS just did a story uh
criticizing what some consumers are
saying about the Cyber truck does it
matter what they're criticizing about
the Cyber truck no that's not important
to the story what's important is the CBS
who is allegedly one of the mainstream
entities who are really just um puppets
for the main powers as Mike Ben could
explain to you is going after musk
because he's not in the control of the
people who want to be in control so the
people like Trump are being attacked
with the the entire Justice System
you're seeing all of the areas of the
government being weaponized against musk
and now you see the media supporting
them with stories about his products do
you see it yet no none of it's
organic this is all organized attacks on
citizens of the United States largely by
citizens of the United
States
um Elon Musk himself said yesterday the
public still doesn't understand even a
tiny fraction of the power of the
censorship government industrial complex
as predicted my companies and I came
under Relentless attacks the moment the
censorship of the platform was lifted
how far will they go to stop
me well so far he lost $56 billion in
pay because the state of Delaware said
nope you can't have it Trump has lost
uh 450 billion if you count the
interest and could bankrupt them uh I
was cancelled and my entire income was
erased do you see it
yet everybody see
yeah so now the powers that be have
assembled a set of tools which they can
use internally to first of all map out
who is
influential and then they can Target
them and they can kill them with Dei hey
they're racist and then the media will
back them they can kill him with the
legal system hey he committed a crime
and even if he didn't the media will
back it so even if even if later it's
overturned it doesn't matter the public
will still think it's a crime um so it
looks like they control uh you know all
the various departments through Soros
they they control all the external
entities they control the internal fact
Checkers and then there are groups like
the uh you know the ADL that are
probably have some funding connection to
the whole blob so pretty much everything
internally is fake uh and not what you
think it is but it does answer all the
Mysteries all the
Mysteries this this is why my mind was
so blown listening to Mike
Ben because it removed every mystery
I've had every single thing is explained
all of
it
and let me uh here's the story I don't
know if this is true but Texas Lindsay
was posting this uh cm BC was caught on
a hot mic uh with an interview with the
meta's president of global Affairs and
they asked them how many I guess how
many people were working on um
disinformation now remember I told you
that they changed language so that they
could use their external spy tools
internally disinformation is whatever
they say is
disinformation so what really is
happening is they want to get rid of
information that's not
convenient so they just say it's
disinformation so how much
disinformation uh effort is meta doing
well here's the exchange CNBC how many
people do you have working on Election
misinformation meta we have around
40,000 people working on integrity and
safety wait
what
40,000 and apparently the hot mik caught
the CNBC host saying 40,000 they only
have 67,000
employees and then meta The Meta person
kept going and he said we spend around
20 billion on this issue we spent five
billion last year alone on Election
Integrity do you know what election
integrity
means it primarily means telling the
public the voting by absentee ballot or
voting by mail is totally safe which is
absolutely not
true so this voter Integrity is to lie
to the country so that voting by mail is
popular now according to Mike
Benz the CIA knew before um 2020
election that mass mass mailin votes
would favor
Democrats and it would be a real problem
if Trump seemed to have won by a lot um
but then later the votes came in the the
mail and votes were counted and have
flipped it which is what happened so the
CIA knew in advance that having a
emergency let's say Co that moved them
into a mailin ballot situation or
allowed them to exploit that they knew
that that would allow them to win and
they knew that the public would not
trust that it was a legitimate election
so they had plan to deal with
it just think about that the CIA knew
who was going to win because they had
GED the system to make it so that's the
that's the
allegation and certainly you probably
said to yourself how could it be true
that a protest was turned into an
Insurrection well this is why there
there's no mystery to it uh the news is
controlled so they can just say that a
protest is an insurrection and it gives
them more tools to arrest Trump and to
um hunt and suppress his followers and
put populists in jail so yeah that's all
crooked so all the the social media
networks except for X appear to be owned
by uh the system and they're spending
tremendous amounts of money to make sure
you do not hear the
truth that really is what they're
suppressing is the truth and it's very
direct
um Dr Cornell West had a funny quote he
said when I look at Donald Trump I see
Civil War number two when I look at Joe
Biden I see World War number
three he's good at that stuff isn't he
like that that man can turn the
phrase um the Civil War right you know I
don't think it'll be a literal Civil War
but you can see that division would be
through the roof so did you wonder why
everything went wrong in this country
you know you thought just everything was
broken it turns out there might be one
group of people who are easily
identified who have created a behemoth
of interconnecting web of power that
just broke everything because what you
think is broken is not broken from their
perspective because if they weaponize
something it's not broken to
them you know the gun
ownership might look broken to some
people because so many people get killed
by guns but it's not broken if you need
a gun to defend your house right to you
it's just a weapon if you're the person
who doesn't own a gun it's a huge
problem it's a it's a risk if you own a
gun and you need it to shoot the guy who
came in your house to shoot you it's a
tool so what you think is everything in
society broken
is somebody else's weapon that's working
exactly the way they wanted it to and
that's why it maintains the reason it's
not self correcting is that the people
in charge of it don't want it corrected
because that would take their weapon
away how's your brain
doing yeah your brain's probably
exploding you have no idea how bad it's
going to get until you listen to Mike
Ben yeah
so how much danger do you think I'm
in
personally how much danger like physical
and Legal Financial danger I I know I'm
in financial
danger um obviously Financial
Peril but what about
physical I don't think I'm in physical
danger and here's why I believe that
everything I say
reaches zero
Democrats nothing I say reaches any
Democrat because because I'm accused
racist I can't be on
television right I can't be on
television I can be on podcasts of
people who largely agree with me so I'm
just talking to people who don't need
any convincing because they're already
there so I have been
completely uh
neutralized completely neutralized
do do you think a lot of Democrats are
in the feed right now so I'm on YouTube
which in theory could be discovered by
anybody so in in the comments on uh the
other platforms on let's say just
YouTube if you're on YouTube are you a
Democrat there's something wrong with
the comments it looks like so probably I
won't say but I'll bet you I get
basically no Democrats so if
the CIA
platforms can simply make me talk to
myself that's all they need to do but
you can't do that with Trump because
Trump is going to be heard he's too big
you can't do with musk because musk is
too big so you go have to go after their
finances you have to go after them
financially you have to go after them
legally but me they already
won I'm completely
neutralized because I have no cont with
Democrats or anybody who needs to know
the truth so I can sit here and tell you
oh yeah the entire thing is rigged in my
opinion we don't have a democracy
anymore if we ever did we don't have a
republic but we we have something closer
to a Russian Chinese Iranian situation
where there's a group of
people whose uh interests run
everything
um
but if they killed me let's say if they
killed me or jailed me uh it would be
hard to ignore me but if they just let
me talk on my little channels and nobody
sees but people who already agree with
me I have no effect on anything I'm
actually the safest person they could
possibly worry about remember they have
they have influence
Maps so they can see how I could
possibly get to a Democrat and they can
just clip it off they can just prune
that part of my tree so that my message
goes out to everybody who's already
convinced and just stops when it might
have gotten to some population that
wasn't had never heard it
before that's complete
control complete
control
so what happened in 2016 appears to be
catching them off guard caught him off
guard didn't see it coming because the
polls were
wrong so what's it going to take to fix
it I don't know I don't know we'll
figure it out but I will tell you that
one thing that could fix it is an
overwhelming Victory by Trump uh then
they'd have to show their
hand we're we might be close to the
point where they don't have to hide it
anymore I think we might be there I I
think they probably don't have to hide
it anymore because it's just so powerful
uh there's nothing you could do all
right that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the mind-breaking stories of
today I'm going to say bye to uh
platforms of YouTube and Rumble and x uh
if you like to uh if you'd like to be
watching the Dilbert reborn comic uh I
remind you that it's subscription only
now so I can hide from the bad guys and
it's on the xplatform you can see my
profile for that or on locals where you
get lots of other
stuff and if you were watching it today
you would see that uh uh Dilbert's
garbage man is training his own AI model
using the garbage that he encounters on
his route and Dilbert's confused he says
I didn't know you could train AI on
garbage and garbage man says well
there's a lot you don't know and then
Dilbert
realizes
you're you're training the AI through
the garbage to make movies right and
then the garbage man says I got a five
film deal from
Disney so that's the sort of stuff
you're missing things I couldn't do in
my syndication days and now I can say
directly anything I want you know within
reason and uh that's what you're missing
so thanks for joining
