oh good morning
let me tell you what just happened i was
uh playing with my
um playing with my system setup here and
accidentally went live
so there's a reason that nobody's
watching this
and uh in a moment we're gonna go live
on periscope
actually i think i'll go live a little
early maybe give them a little bit of a
thrill
anybody have any any questions before we
go
before we go officially live
i'm accidentally live all right let me
get my notes here for a moment
i'm afraid you're gonna have to wait
hey everybody we will do the
simultaneous sip
at the usual time no getting ahead
no no getting ahead that will not be
allowed
now you get to see what i do minutes
before i officially go live
all right it's actually eight minutes
before i'm supposed to be live
uh periscope will have to wait for a
minute
good morning somebody says
are artists typically left leaning
that's a good question
i would think so i would say most i'm
not sure i wouldn't consider myself an
artist
so uh somebody asked me if i'm wearing
my pj pants
here here's a
maybe i shouldn't admit this uh every
one of my periscopes i've done in my
pajamas
uh every one of them so generally
generally what you see me wearing when
i'm doing the periscopes is what
whatever i woke up and
usually a t-shirt pajamas
it's a kilt no just pajamas yeah i don't
even
when you see the periscopes i haven't i
haven't shaved or
i haven't even brushed my teeth so you
get me
fresh out of bed
um simplicity is good that's right
i was going to do a uh micro lesson on
simplicity
for the locals platform
no bed hair to worry about i tell you
the the day that i decided to start
cutting my hair short because i was
obviously losing my hair so it was just
a better look
it made my life so much easier i'm going
to tell you something that i'm very
proud of
when i was in college or maybe high
school
i found a steel comb
on the ground just somebody had lost it
outdoors and it was the coolest little
comb and so i washed it up and
i made it my own comb and when i was in
high school it seems funny to even think
about it i would carry a comb with me
you know just in case i needed to fix up
my hair a little bit during the day i
would just have always have this little
steel comb
and occasionally i would misplace it and
then i would
find it and it became sort of a thing
over the years
that i would lose it and then i would
always find it
and for maybe i don't know 20 or 30
years
i had the same comb that i'd found on
the ground
as a teenager and i still haven't
i never lost it in 40 years
i can't use the clock you're right so
let me tell you what i was doing when
i accidentally hit live so i wasn't
intending to be live
live streaming until until the appointed
time when we'll do the simultaneous
stuff
there's a there's a step where you make
a
profile not a profile picture a
thumbnail
and i was just getting ready to make my
thumbnail and i
and when you when it went live
i thought i'd hit the button to retake
the thumbnail
so when i went live i was posing like
this
because the the photo i was going to put
as my thumbnail was me giving myself a
vaccination
so is this the live chat or not it is it
is so you're you're in the right place
uh you made a video of my thumbnails
uh can i look at andrew saul's talk i
don't know who he is
who is andrew saul
so how many of you how many of you are
going to get the vaccination
once it's available
what percentage of you will be first
i'm kind of glad that i'm not uh
automatically going to be first
so i don't have to make the decision you
know aren't you kind of glad that you
don't have to make the decision yet
you can sort of wait a little bit you
know see what else see how much it hurts
what are the odds that well let me ask
you this
i know this is these are different kinds
of uh vaccinations so it's not like
we've had before
but what are the odds that the most
important vaccination
the world has ever had is also the one
that hurts the most
and also the only one that takes two
vaccinations that i know of
like really what are the odds that only
this one
would hurt and you need it twice
if you were going to create a situation
that would guarantee
people don't want to take it it would be
that that plus the fact that it's new uh
we got
three minutes until uh the real show so
if you have any uh
questions i shall take them
oh hpv takes three vaccinations okay
well
so i guess there are more hepatitis b is
three
well like i said there are plenty of
vaccinations that require
multiple uh oh shingles takes two
yeah just like i said there are lots of
different vaccine
vaccinations to take multiple
i think you can tell i'm behind on my
shots
very behind what brand of coffee do i
drink
starbucks i'm not a big coffee
guy i'm going to tell you a little
coffee trick
this might might make you feel less good
about me
but my coffee at least lately
is a half hot water and half coffee so i
actually water down the coffee
until it's just a coffee flavored
hot water now you might say to yourself
my god how can i drink coffee flavored
hot water
when i'm used to full-bodied real coffee
and the answer is you can get used to
anything
you can actually train yourself to like
things you don't like
by the way did you know that one of the
things that
hypnotists know and regular people don't
is that you can change your preferences
that's weird isn't it you can actually
change
what flavors taste good to you and i've
done it so many times that i can say
this with
you know complete certainty you know i
don't need a
i don't need a scientific study because
during my life i've set out to
intentionally change my flavor
preferences and succeeded easily
i i know it could be done i've done it
multiple times and one of the things
that i set out to do
was to change my coffee flavor
preference
from strong coffee just because i was
used to it
to a week watered down kind of thing
because
i could get more enjoyment of sipping
without too much caffeine and so
i just add 50 hot water
the first time you have coffee that's 50
hot water your first reaction is
how could i possibly drink this
but you probably had a similar reaction
if any of you had this
experience of going from regular soda
let's say a
coke to a diet coke the first time you
make the transition you're like oh
what is this awful thing but then you
get used to the new thing and you can't
even
imagine drinking the old thing anymore
it's very it's very easy to rewire your
preferences
so that's a real thing all right in one
minute i'm going to hit
periscope and then ladies and gentlemen
we're going to be live and i'm going to
tell you a great story about george
clooney you're going to like it
all right it's go time
hold on pretend i just started
you didn't see this nothing happened
here
forget what you've seen boop
bump bump bump
well good morning and welcome to the
simultaneous sip the best time of the
whole day
if you've been wondering in that 24 hour
period which is the best part
of it because you know you got 24
different hours there which one's the
good one
it's this is this one yeah a lot of
people think
another time is good but no they're
they're all inferior to this one and all
you need to make it the best
of the best time is a cup or a mug of
glass
a tanker chelsea stein a canteen sugar
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopey beauty of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
if you hear a motor it's because i just
put my motorized
shades down go
oh delightful
i believe it made everything better
except the supreme court
yeah supreme court still needs a little
work
um my photoshop problem is
fixed and it turns out the fix is that
they just took that feature away
so i just had to do it i had to learn a
whole new way to do it which was not a
big deal
but the feature that i was trying to
make work it just they just took it away
all right here's my favorite story of
the day
and i present myself often on these
periscopes
as not just a cartoonist but as a
let's say someone who can help you
filter the from the reality
and here's the here's my favorite
example now if you fell for this one
you you have only yourself to blame
i was just watching an interview with
george clooney and there was a headline
i saw
that said that george clooney cuts his
own hair
uh during the pandemic but also has been
doing it for years
using a flowbee now if you're a certain
age
you know what a flowbee is it's an
attachment you put to your own
vacuum cleaner and it sucks your hair up
if you have hair
and then it it cuts you know cuts your
hair
uh perfectly because it's sucked it up
with the vacuum and then it cuts at the
right height and then you just go to a
new place and you vacuum and
cut it's called the flowbee and so
george clooney uh is asked about
his hair and he says that he uses a
flowbee to cut his hair
and he describes how he got it years ago
and he still cuts his hair every day
with the flowbee
now there's a little bit of context
that was left out of the story let me
add some context
george clooney is literally famous as a
prankster
it's one of his you know most famous
characteristics
when he's working on movie sets he's
famous for playing pranks
on his co-workers now
george clooney has a good haircut it's
such a good haircut
that i'm just going to guess there might
have been a professional haircutter
involved
now in a pandemic especially if you're a
celebrity
do you go on camera and say yes i
violate the
pandemic and i just have somebody come
over and cut my hair at close quarters
do you think he says that no
no no he says i use a flowbee
and then he tells a detailed story about
how he got his flowbee and how he still
cuts his hair every day
and then the the credulous reporter said
is your current haircut from the
flowbaby and he's like yeah
yeah right here and i'm watching this
freaking thing
and it's just the funniest it's just the
funniest damn thing
that it became a national story and it
could not be more obviously a prank
it was one of my best stories of the
week all right rapper little wayne is in
trouble
uh you may know he faces up to 10 years
in federal prison
after pleading guilty on uh
federal or illegal gun possession now
it's worse for him i guess he has a
prior felony
so if you have a illegal gun on top of a
prior felony it doesn't matter if you're
trying to commit a crime with it because
that is the crime just
having a gun so
here is a little legal strategy i would
like to suggest to rapper lil wayne
it goes like this lil wayne is one of
the people
who came out either pro-chump i don't
remember if he was pro-trump or just
he was okay with trump but he got sort
of labeled on that side
that unpopular side where he was kind of
okay with trump
i feel like he should get a pardon
because i think you could make the case
that anybody who's going to jail in our
current environment who also was a
supporter of trump
is not going to get a fair trial right
how could anybody get a fair trial in
the context
of being a trump supporter in this
current time
because we're watching democrats
literally and publicly
finding a variety of ways in which they
say in public
we're looking to punish anybody who
supported trump we're
actually looking to punish them for
political opinion
now if i'm president trump and i'm
thinking you know maybe my odds of a
second term are
pretty low right now and i knew that
rapper lil wayne
supported me and i knew that his only
crime was not an act there was no actual
crime
in other words the crime was just having
a gun
there was no intention no no allegation
he was going to use it for something
specific
so really there was no victim
and in the context of nobody who
supports the president
should expect a fair trial
is that a fair statement don't you think
it's a completely
reasonable statement to say that any
notable
figure who is notable for supporting
trump
they could not get a fair sentence or a
fair trial
in the united states in 2020
isn't that a fair statement i think
that's completely fair
now it wouldn't be probably fair it
wouldn't be a strong enough statement
to have it have the court overturn
anything or for the court to reverse
anything
but it's a hundred percent strong enough
for president trump to pardon him
it's a hundred percent strong enough for
that in fact
if you could show me a better reason for
a pardon i've never seen one
i've never seen one i i will i will hold
up
rapper lil wayne in my opinion
is the strongest case for a pardon
presidential pardon
i've ever seen now i don't know if his
crime
is the kind that can be parted i don't
know if it's federal or it's
state so i don't know how that works
maybe he can't be pardoned
but if he can be i would
uh later today maybe or uh soon i'm
going to do a lesson on reframing
on the locals platform so if you're a
subscriber to
locals locals.com where
you can follow me for a subscription
price i'm going to teach you
a hypnotist lesson on reframing
now a lot of hypnosis is something you
really need to be trained to do
but reframing is something anybody can
do just by sort of understanding what it
is
and a little bit of a b testing on your
own but reframing can change you from
unhappy to happy it can change a good
time or a bad time to a good time
you can change a loss into a victory so
reframing is one of the most powerful
tools
you'll ever have in your life so that'll
be on locals
later for subscribers breaking news the
fda has authorized
pfizer's vaccine i don't know if i want
to be first
but i have a lot of respect for those
who will
right now i wouldn't say that i'm afraid
of the
the the vaccinations
but i will say that the longer you go
before you get it
the more you might know so i i would
expect i'll get a vaccination
if you're looking for what are other
people doing you know to
help make your decision what i'm doing
is not making up my mind
until the last moment i need to which is
when it's available to people like me
so until it's available to people like
me
i'm not going to make a decision when it
is available i will look at all the
information
i doubt there will be much more that we
don't you know that we've learned since
then
but if there's anything more i'll
incorporate it and if there's nothing
more
i probably will get the vaccination so
if you're wondering you know how people
are thinking about it how they're doing
their
cost benefit analysis i can't just
separate
the benefit to other people from the
benefit to myself
is there some risk that i would have
some harm from the vaccination
yes in the sense that anything is a risk
sort of in the general universal way
that risks
exist but it is sort of a
a war situation isn't it you know the
coronavirus is sort of like going to war
and if you said to me scott do you want
to personally protect yourself at the
risk of taking this vaccination
uh if i were the only person in the
world
would make sense with a pandemic but
imagine if if the only thing i had to
ima
think about was my own well-being i
might
make a different decisions but if you're
in a war
and you're a soldier and we all are
we've been asked by our general
to take a risk that might be a little
bit bigger than you wanted to take for
yourself
and the reason you're being asked to
take that risk is for the benefit of
someone else who might have been
infected in your chain of infections if
you don't take the vaccination
so as an individual i might make a
different decision but as a
soldier uh i'm gonna
almost certainly obey orders i mean i'm
going to look at all the information
but that's my my inclination is to obey
orders in the context of a war
and i consider this a war so if there's
some risk
to me but the point is for the to win
the war
i accept my role as a as a soldier
um steve schmidt of the uh the lincoln
project he's one of those
main guys he's reached out to aoc in the
most
awkward tweet i've ever seen
so this is what steve schmidt tweets at
aoc
i would like to officially reach out to
aoc
on behalf of the lincoln project
in defense of democracy and he says we
disagree on many issues
and that is okay in our view oh that's
nice
how about that did you know that the the
lincoln project
uh apparently they think it's okay to
disagree
on on issues did you know that
that's pretty big of them because a lot
of people were thinking that
they uh were were completely communist
but it turns out that they they do think
it's okay to disagree on issues so
that's a big step
so thank you steve for telling us that
because we we didn't know that until he
said it
and he said we disagree on many issues
and that is okay in our view by the way
we don't look down on waitresses
what we admire them
we are all the types we're all the types
of guys who always tip at 50
or more this is so awkward
okay have you ever heard of the uh
the pickup artist strategy called
negging
n-e-g-g-i-n-g
the technique is considered a
manipulative let's say
unethical way to manipulate people
into sex specifically women and the
pickup artists learn
that the way you get women to respond to
you
and potentially become sexual partners
is with this concept
called nagging and the idea is that you
you suddenly find a way to tear down
their ego
and they will and and the the theory
goes
uh the theory goes and i can't say that
i've uh
i've never intention i will say that
i've never intentionally used this
method
so i don't have i don't have a personal
experience that it even works
but a lot of people say it works and
it's part of the body of persuasion
so i'll talk about it as if it works but
i haven't personally
i can't tell you that it works from
experience however
the technique is very clear if you say
to somebody who is
a an elected congress person
and not just an elected congress person
aoc is one of the most capable political
people of our era
right you know you say why you will
about disagreeing with her and
the green new deal is crazy and blah
blah blah
so i know all the criticisms but it is
nonetheless true
that she has achieved a tremendous
success of getting where she is and she
has a great weight and gravitas she's
moved
the entire party all right so that's who
she is
she's this person who's moved the
country
with her personal force of will etc
and steve schmidt decides that in his
tweet where he's reaching out to her
he needs to mention that she was
recently a waitress
that's nagging right you make it look
like you're not doing it
for a purpose it's just it's another
purpose no i'm we're just saying that we
get along with you we're not going to
insult you that's all i'm saying
oh did i mention that you were only
recently a waitress
oh yeah that's just part of the story
there's no reason i'm mentioning it it's
just because we're good guys
that's nagging all right now
i don't know if he was thinking of it
intentionally or it just
came out exactly like negging but
he used the word waitresses now there is
some
disagreement on using that word
waitresses is like i would describe it
as the
the the mildest version just by analogy
of the n-word the n-word is something
that
a person could use about themselves if
they happen to be black
but you wouldn't use it about somebody
if you were not talking about yourself
right unless you were black so
waitress and waiter are like that
people who work as servers which is the
more generic
accepted term at the moment people work
as service
servers often call themselves waiters
and waitresses
and when they call themselves that
nothing wrong with it you can call
yourself anything you want
right but when other people use the word
waitress it it just
wakes up this little part that says it
feels like
it's a woman's job and that's not quite
the vibe of 2020 because obviously it's
not a just a woman's job
and so i feel sexist and it feels
old-fashioned and so
in his reaching out he used a word which
he has used about herself
but he has a little blind spot which is
she can use it about herself
using it about yourself completely
appropriate other people using it
well some people will be offended some
will not
some people are saying bartender was the
right word i think it was both wasn't it
usually if you're a bartender you're
also a server in most restaurants you're
going to do a little of both
all right so i fact-checked them and
said they're called servers by the
people who don't look down on them
that's not entirely true but it was
funny and then he has this part where
all the types of guys who tip
50 or more that is really nothing but
showing his penis to her
that's all that is right because
why did he need to throw the part in
about them being big tippers
and their guys that is nothing but a
penis measuring
statement it had no
applicability it was condescending it
was the most awkward tweet i've ever
seen in my life
all right uh texas gop
chairman uh alan west uh who's talking
about the supreme court we'll talk about
and he was saying that perhaps
law-abiding states should bond together
and form a union of states that will
abide by the constitution
so so alan west thinks maybe
texas should start a new country of
people who actually followed the
constitution
now i don't think that's going anywhere
but there'll probably be more talk about
it all right supreme court
tossed out or i don't know the proper
legal word but they have rejected shall
we say the
latest lawsuit that was the texas
lawsuit
and other states were bonding to or yeah
the texas lawsuit again
against the other states now the smart
people
had warned you that the supreme court
was not going to go by the constitution
on this one
now they gave a reason this seems
vaguely constitutional and the reason
was
that that the lawsuit didn't have
standing
texas didn't have standing a legal term
which means that it's none of their
business
that's it so the supreme court did not
look at the evidence
they didn't look at the details they
just said uh
texas why don't you stay out of the
business of the other states
that's it that was the ruling now if the
ruling
does not look at any of the uh evidence
presented
none of it and
if the only reason is because it was one
state interfering with another
what it how would uh let's say
cnn report that well i watched chris
cuomo report the news
and the way he reported it was that it
was rejected because there was no
evidence of fraud
now isn't that the opposite of what
happened
because it seems to me it was a gigantic
document the lawsuit
filled with evidence of fraud now
evidence doesn't mean true
but it was a gigantic document of
evidence
now it is true that the
the the lawsuit isn't going anywhere so
it so it seems to be as dead as anything
can be and that part's true
but it's not dead because there was no
evidence of fraud
it was dead in spite of a gigantic pile
of evidence of fraud
now what's going to happen to this video
on youtube well i think we know because
the last time i
made a statement about evidence of fraud
simply noting the evidence of fraud
existed
my video was censored now when i say
censored
a lot of you say scott scott's got
censorship
is when the government does it it's not
censorship of a private company that you
could use
or not use you know they they have
competitors
that's not censorship you're using the
word wrong
well let me make a case for using the
word
correctly the government
we agree is the one who has the power to
censor or not censor
in this context that's what the word
means but
because the government knows exactly
what the social media companies are
doing
and it allows that it allows it
specifically
in other words the government has
created a law
a structure of laws that allow the
social media companies to
to suppress the views of a certain kind
of person with a certain kind of view
in a way that the government knows is
happening they can observe it too
and they've put they have laws that
actually support it
the fact that the social media networks
don't have
the risk of being sued but they could
if the law did that means that the
government
has decided that the social media
networks
have been delegated the power of
censorship
by the government now you could say
scott that's not what people intended to
do
the government never made a decision to
to outsource its censorship to private
companies and they didn't
nobody ever had a meeting nobody ever
had a conversation
nobody signed a document that says we
the government of the united states
delegate our authority for censorship to
these private companies that never
happened
but it's what happened it doesn't really
matter
if somebody intended it to happen here
we are
we are in a situation where the
government
sees what the social media companies do
and says that's legal
and as long as that's blessed by the
government and completely legal
i would say that they have delegated
their authority of censorship
for all practical purposes so you could
argue that the social media companies
are not
government censorship and i would argue
that that's
technically true but not true in a real
way
because if the government wanted the
social media companies not to do that
they would simply stop it and so
anything that the government allows
to happen is basically sanctioned
right wouldn't you say it's sanctioned
by the government if they allow it
and they have the complete ability to
stop it
so i would say it's government
censorship it's just working through the
social media it might be completely
legal
but it's still government censorship in
effect
the fact that social media companies do
it doesn't matter so i opened a rumble
account so if any of my videos get taken
down
on youtube just go over to rumble
and google my name and your real coffee
with scott adams and it will pop right
up
now i've only put one video over there
so far it's the one that got taken down
i think this one will get taken down for
the same reason
and if it does you can just go see it
over there all right
um i was looking at the now that
it looks like trump will not have a
second term i was looking at the
genius of the the hoax system
because you know they had to find people
hoax and that would
paint trump as a racist they had the
drinking bleach hoax
that paints him as anti-science they had
the mocking the disabled guy hoax
that makes him look like a bully against
everybody
and then they had the kids in cages hoax
which
wasn't exactly a hoax because that
actually happened but
the context is all left out and i don't
mean the context that
obama built the cages i mean the context
that
there was a surge of immigrants and the
alternative
of just letting the kids go with their
abusers in many cases
was deemed worse so the the real story
of the kids in cages is that
nobody was happy about it but it wasn't
as bad as the alternative
in that emergency situation it was also
terribly handled
in every way i think the administration
botched the handling of it
but it was largely a hoax and i was
looking at the
the entirety of the hoax structure and
it's kind of genius
because they managed to find a hoax that
fit every uh every claim
so for whatever was the major claim that
would bother you
psychologically they they attached a
hoax to it you know what would be more
bothersome
than somebody's a racist that's a pretty
big
issue right so they attach a hoax to it
to find people
what would be worse than a president who
didn't care about science
that's pretty bad so they attached the
drinking bleach hoax to that to give it
you know substance and then you know
mocking the disabled guy who wants a
bully
bullies are really a triggering kind of
thing and kids in cages
you know who wants a heartless president
so the the brilliance
of the hoax structure is actually sort
of breathtaking
and i almost wonder when you see how
complete it is and how well done it is
you wonder if it was actually strategic
as opposed to they just turned whatever
they could into a hoax and it just
worked out that way
it feels as if somebody almost mapped it
out
like somebody who was really good at
persuasion said all right
we've got five things that different
parts of the public respond to
some are going to respond to these kids
in cages some
to bullying some to you know mocking
disabled some to
racism etc there and people are
triggered by slightly different things
but we've got
five of them or four or whatever
and so now we're going to look for you
know we're going to be on the lookout
for which hoax to attach to them because
once you attach the hoax
it becomes visual right if i said that
the president
doesn't appreciate science
that's a concept but if i say the
president suggested drinking bleach
there's a movie you see it
you immediately see it likewise the tiki
torch marchers is visual
the mocking the the uh this disabled guy
that's visual so what they did was turn
visual
your greatest fears and the way they
turned it visual is adding a hoax to
each one
it's really really good it is so good
that it's either sort of a
lucky coincidence or they just
improv their way into a good situation
or there is a gigantic
tell here for a pretty deep
psychological operation by somebody who
knows how to do
this stuff because this stuff was done
better than i've ever seen
it done or maybe you don't notice it if
it's done really well
so i guess i wouldn't have noticed it
but uh
all right um
[Music]
don't we need to change our our
immigration naturalization test i was
telling you the other day
that there was some controversy over the
changes in the test so if you want to
become a citizen and naturalized
immigration you take a test and some of
the tests are about our form of
government
and one of the questions is what kind of
a form of government
are we the correct test used to be
that we're a republic and i think there
were a few versions of that but
basically
some version of saying we're a republic
but we're so clearly not a republic now
because whatever we are whatever
happened in this election
we don't know so we can't even say for
sure
that there was a fraud enough to change
it or not
because what protects us from knowing if
we had an even
an election that was credible is the
bullying
the violence so there's this layer of
violence that prevented the witnesses
from seeing things
there's a layer of bullying and you know
you could say social media
violence keeping republicans from having
visibility
on what happened and the courts etc
so i don't think that's too strong a
statement and i don't think it's
hyperbole
to say that we did lose the republic
this year
now we'll probably be fine you know the
weird thing about the world is
we adapt to change really well things go
wrong
we fix it so we'll probably fix it
my guess is that we'll we'll drift back
to the you know the reasonable middle
but at the moment we are techn we're not
in any way a republic
and it would be weird if somebody missed
one too many questions
and the one they missed was this one
it's almost like you would have a
lawsuit
imagine you know your your client was
denied citizenship because
one question got wrong and it was that
one and then your lawyer says
your honor my client said this was not a
republic
and here's the evidence that he is
correct
i don't know could he make a lawsuit out
of that and become a citizen because
you're the only one who knows we're not
a republic
it seems like you would be an extra good
citizen because you'd be smarter than
the ones who live here
all right uh and then this guy bill
pascal
he's demanding that the he's a
representative democrat he's
representing
he says that he wants the house
leadership to refuse to seat
the 126 republicans support who
supported the texas
lawsuit about the election now
this is nothing but collective well not
collective but it's just punishment
for political opinions and people doing
completely legal things can you
can you believe that somebody could say
this in public
and we've reached a point where the
thought of punishing
republicans for just sort of being
republicans
is acceptable enough that you can say it
in public
and not get your ass kicked and not lose
your job
it's now acceptable to it's acceptable
in all forms of the public to
flow ideas for punishing citizens
for different opinions that's an
actual conversation we're having where
nobody's embarrassed
to be in the conversation it's it's
really impressive
uh how how things can change
um i asked this in a poll do you think
there would be grounds for removing joe
biden after
assuming he gets inaugurated would there
be grounds to remove him under the 25th
amendment
strictly for believing the fine people
hoax
i feel as if that would be a good enough
reason because
if somebody believes a hoax that can be
debunked as easily as just reading the
transcript
that's it it's not there's no challenge
to it here's the transcript
all right now you can see it was a hoax
and
one third of the reason he ran for
office was on that hoax
if one third of the reason that you ran
for office
was based on a hoax that is
transparently obviously not true
are you mentally capable because to me
that seems like proof
of a lack of mental capability
because if you're an old person you're
more likely to be
taken in by hoax right by scams
i feel like that's pretty strong
evidence that he's not capable
speaking of not being capable so i guess
the new yorker
the new yorker did a long article on
feinstein senator feinstein
and how she is allegedly losing her
mental faculties and her short-term
memory now add that conversation
you know is feinstein uh mentally
capable
same questions we've had about pelosi
same questions they've had about trump
same questions about joe biden and i've
got my own questions about adam schiff i
don't think he's
got dementia but there's something wrong
with that guy
and i'm thinking to myself if one of
your main conversations
about your leaders is about their level
of dementia
you're doing something really wrong
however you've designed your political
system
which used to be called a republic and
now it's something else a bulliocracy
maybe
you're really doing it wrong if you're
having a lot of conversations
about the relative amount of dementia
your leaders have
keep in mind that we're not even talking
about whether they're
you know completely gone or they don't
have it
we're really talking about how much
because
feinstein's a case of it's not so much
does she or
doesn't she have some mental decline
it's really about how much
with joe biden it's not about whether he
has mental decline it's obvious if you
see
old videos of him he's a different
person but we're really talking about
how much with nancy pelosi everybody
a lot of people seem to admit she's very
effective at her job
but it's also pretty clear that she's
lost a step
we just don't know how much
how is it that we're having honest
legitimate
transparent conversations about the
obvious mental decline of our leaders
and we're okay with that we're actually
okay with that
shouldn't the you know if you were
thinking in terms of systems
instead of goals a goal might be to get
the topics you want and get your
healthcare and everything
so you'd have a lot of goals that you
want but i would think that
a systems approach should be we
shouldn't be talking about people's
dementia
we should figure out a way that that's
not part of our process and maybe
we could get to a better outcome then
all right so
overall 36 percent of voters uh believe
the election was stolen
36 so in a world in which
36 percent of voters believe the
election was stolen
if i as a youtube creator
say there are allegations that the
election was stolen
in the context of 36 percent of the
people saying it was
and i just simply say there are
allegations
my video will be removed it looks like
think about that i will be censored
effectively by the government
via the social media platforms that they
allow to work this way
for simply saying the same thing the
poll says
because the poll says 36 percent of
people doubt it
in other words they allege there was
fraud i
just reporting a poll result could get
me
taken off the platform whoops
think about that just think about the
enormity of that
that just talking about the poll results
exactly the way they are
adding adding no hyperbole no opinion
whatsoever
just talking about the poll results
would get me pulled off of a major
platform
i mean that's so mind-boggling
that it's it's unbelievable
apparently 77 percent of trump voters
think he
i think he actually won as do 26 percent
of independents and even 10 percent of
democrats
10 percent of democrats think the
election was stolen
do you think they know something maybe
here's my
my guess people answer polls
based a little bit on what they want the
outcome to be right
so people don't answer this kind of poll
honestly it's just not something
people do so if you're a republican you
probably did answer it honestly because
you got nothing to lose
if you're a democrat and you want the
result to stand
you say to yourself uh do i admit
that i also kind of think it might be
stolen or
do i want to keep the result and one of
the ways to do that is make sure that
the poll
looks like people believe it's a
legitimate result so you can't believe
any of the democrats except maybe the 10
who went
against forum and said they think it's
stolen if i had to guess
i'll just put a this is pure speculative
my
my guess of the number of democrats who
really believe the election was either
stolen or
really could have been closer to
50 would be my guess how about you
what would be your guess we can't know
right we're not mind readers
there's no poll that's dependable on
this but
what would you guess is the number is
the percentage of democrats
who privately won't say it out loud
but privately think it was stolen
yeah i'm looking at your numbers i'm
seeing 30 50 20
35 100 somebody says 100
that's a little too cynical 60 47
yeah we're i think we're all thinking
along the same lines
that it's not like we don't
you know as a majority in this country
i feel like the solid majority thinks
the election was stolen
i also think that the majority thinks
maybe that's just always the way it is
maybe it's always stolen so they don't
care so much
all right would you like some
provocative stuff now
i know you would i know you would
and here it comes since we have this
social media
censorship what do you do about it
there's of course
a big limit to what the government could
do because they can do this section 230
thing but it doesn't look like congress
is willing to do that
because there are trade-offs section 230
might
kill you know kill industries or it
might even kill just the competitors
could make it worse so the section 230
thing is
is a possibility but it doesn't look
like a perfect solution
so if we were to brainstorm a little bit
more and say
all right what would a perfect solution
look like well i would love a solution
where the social media networks allowed
you to turn
off their algorithm where you could just
turn it off and you could be sure it was
turned off
but i don't know how i would ever be
sure it was turned off
as a as a user how would you ever know
you would you'd always suspect right
it's like well i push the button and it
says i turned off the algorithm but i
feel as if people aren't seeing my
tweets right
so people would suspect that that wasn't
working
so even if these social media networks
did say yeah you can just turn off the
algorithm if you want
nobody would believe it right you'd
still be like
i don't know maybe so let me
uh teach you a lesson on business models
so here's a little business strategy
lesson that's going to be tied to this
topic which is could the free market
do anything that would change the
situation in terms of
what i will call government censorship
that just happens to be
expressed through the social media
platforms
and here's a question that i ask because
i don't know why this hasn't already
been done
i've got a really bad glare on there
don't i sorry
youtubers i don't think i can fix that
little glary
so it could be that there's some reason
that the idea i'm gonna
i'm gonna talk about there might be some
reason it can't be done
but i don't think it's a technical
reason and i don't think it's a legal
reason
so i don't know what the reason would be
and it goes like this
why is there no billionaire who just
wants to
change the landscape why is there no
billionaire
who doesn't build what i'll call a god
app
now the god app would be one in which
you could post your content to
any of the competing platforms now this
is just a sample of platforms it could
be
you know 20 different platforms you've
got a you know couple of competitors for
every different thing
now i don't know if it's also possible
that it works both ways
could your god app also read all the
content that other people are posting
and could you reply you know via just
the one app
no matter what platform now let me tell
you what the interface would be
if i were designing this
the way i design it is if you start
that instead of thinking where you're
going to post something
first the only thing you think of first
is what content
you want to post so you start your post
and maybe there's
a video or there's a picture and you add
the video
and then you see all of the the services
that could handle
that content light up which tells you
that
it can handle that content if let's say
you type something too long
and twitter might go dark but it might
also have an adjustment where it can add
a thread option so that twitter can also
handle
longer content but maybe it warns you
that it's not ideal right
so in other words you start with your
content and then the system tells you
where it can go
and then if you don't uh like the format
the way it'll show
you just shake your phone and it gives
you some more suggestions of how to
organize your content you know different
formatting etc
and then just publish now here's the
part that's not obvious about this
yeah somebody says that hootsuite
already does this
but it doesn't all right hootsuite is
just for scheduling
your posts what it doesn't do is allow
you to write one post
i think that can be posted everywhere
but that also you could read the replies
to it
in your app whose suite doesn't do that
so what we do know from hootsuite
is that it is possible to have one app
that can post
to different places but it's not quite
the idea that i'm
expressing now if you did this right
what this does is
inverts the power structure because
right now
i want to be on youtube because it's
good for me
but youtube doesn't care that much right
so youtube has all the power
because i need them but they don't
really need me
specifically they need people but they
don't need me so much
right so right now i don't have any
power
but if i were using the god app i
wouldn't care
if youtube banned me or not wouldn't
make any difference
because i'd have so many platforms i
just put it out there and
people looking for me would look at
another platform
so this would actually invert the power
so the power would end up with the uh
the platforms or
actually the user not the platforms so
the power would go to the user
it would reverse the structure now
this is similar to if you're familiar in
the restaurant business there's
an app called open table open table was
an app
that allowed any restaurant to use the
service and let people
book their reservations online back when
that was a novel thing to do
i when i owned a restaurant back in
those days i resisted
open table aggressively and i tried to
talk
other restaurant owners into resisting
them because restaurant owners are not
very sophisticated
and open table was really for the
independence it wasn't for the chain
restaurants
for the most part it is now but uh
the independents were clearly going to
be taken out of business by open table
because if open table succeeded it would
become
the way that people made reservations
and then open table decided what you saw
in other words open table could say well
i went on to make a reservation for
one restaurant but it decided to promote
another one
because opentable might have had a deal
with them for example yeah
so you don't want anybody to put you in
between
the service that you want and the
customer you don't want the middle
person
to get in the way because they can start
sucking up all the margins
it was obvious to me that once opentable
became
indispensable instead of just a useful
app
as soon as it became indispensable then
they could start
raising their prices until your margin
as an independent restaurant owner would
be shrunk to zero
so it was obvious in the long run the
open table would destroy
independent restaurants likewise
if you put in your your middle app
between the user
and the services you would uh take the
power
away from them to some extent because
you would add
competition that doesn't exist so right
now if you say to me hey
uh it's too hard to compete with these
big
services if you're a little service you
can't compete
but the god app would make competing
easier
because there would be no extra friction
putting something
on rumble if you're also going to put it
on youtube
once you remove the friction you give
the power back to the user and you take
it away from the platforms
why did i ever want to run a restaurant
somebody said well it wasn't
it wasn't because i think restaurants
are good business it was because
my job as a cartoonist was uh lonely
and i had no human contact and so i
wanted to have a business
in the local community that would be
number one good for the community
create some jobs etc but i would have a
place to go
and i could do something more
interesting and uh
you know i had a partner who did the
business part and i was
sort of a financial person and advisor
so i didn't do it to do make money i did
it as an experience
and it was an amazing experience but of
course
restaurants are not really what you want
to do to make money
let's see human contact
have you had the experience yet of
watching a
movie or television show and when you
see the characters get too close to
each other you go because they're not
socially distancing
i i have trouble watching movies now
where characters without masks get close
to each other
because the whole time i'm thinking you
better not do that oh you can do that
it's a movie has anybody had that yet
yeah i'm saying in the comments yes i
have it's it's starting to look weird
to see people close together isn't it
and that is
really messed up the fact that it ever
became
normal to look abnormal
the two characters without masks are
close to each other
that's pretty bad yeah the comments are
lighting up with people saying oh yeah
oh but we have some nerves as well all
right
so somebody says they're always
screaming at the tv when they see
somebody not
socially distancing in a fictional story
somebody says this has never been about
a pathogen
well let me say this it is completely
about the pathogen
there is no great reset this is not part
of a grand
conspiracy to take away your rights
none of that's true right
so if there are any q anon people who
think the pandemic was
fake and it was all part of a major
scheme
i'm here to tell you i've got a pretty
good track record
of spotting
and i can tell you with complete
certainty that whatever the pandemic was
i'm not sure we know all the details of
its origin etc
but whatever it was it wasn't part of
any plan
like there was nobody had a plan unless
it was you know one crazy person who
released it
that might be true but there's no like a
big organization with a
pandemic take over the world plan
and i'm saying in the comments wrong
sorry scott
want to bet
let me put it in this in this uh terms
if you're watching me right now it's
because you've seen me get things right
probably by now i would say that you
wouldn't be watching this
if you hadn't seen me consistently be
right about a lot of stuff
now am i wrong about things too yeah
wrong about trump getting re-elected
did not see the let's say alleged
shenanigans did not predict that at
least
predicted it would make a difference so
i'm going to put this in context there
are some things i say where i'm
well 80 confident there are things i say
when i'm 20 confident this is one of the
few things
that on a scale of 1 to 10 i'm a 10
meaning that there isn't the slightest
chance that the whole pandemic is part
of some
scheme or plan or reset or anything so
on
a scale of one to ten there's nothing
i've talked about that i've been right
about and i've been right about a lot
there's nothing i've talked about that
is more certain
than that that's not real that i i'm at
the maximum amount of certainty
now nothing's 100 right so
i suppose you could be wrong and ghosts
exist and aliens
built the pyramids and i mean anything's
possible
but there isn't i have the highest level
of certainty
that the q anon stuff is not real
so um
somebody says you're watching because
you're hypnotized while you are
you know that difference between what is
formally hypnotized
and what is just influence and you know
what just
is part of the the texture of people
influencing each other
is a little murky but you're always
influenced by anything you spend time
around
so certainly true
somebody says it's a great excuse for
tyranny curfews
random restrictions let me ask you this
by who
who is who is the person behind the the
the need for tyranny and control now i
think it's just a lot of
individuals who are making individual
decisions for lots of different reasons
that's all this
bunch of individuals making individual
decisions
there has never been a meeting where
anybody got together and said
i think we can use this to control
people that that's never happened
bill gates was mentioning it for years
because it was an
obvious risk that was guaranteed to
happen and he was right
um you hope
now do you think do you think there's
any chance i could uh
talk the great reset people and of their
belief
probably not it's pretty pretty hardened
belief
they all sing the same song scott well
it's definitely true that you know
democrats want power and sing the same
song and
etc but now there is no global
conspiracy
to create power by releasing the
pandemic
i guarantee you that's not real
scientists are taking advantage well
it's definitely real that people take
advantage of situations
that's different than an intentional
plot
how does a curfew prevent virus spread
easily
why would even ask somebody's asking how
does a curfew
prevent virus spread how is that not
obvious
it seems pretty obvious isn't it i'm not
even going to answer that if you can't
figure that one out on yourself
phone a friend
now the latest information that i saw
maybe you saw the same
is that the risk of getting coronavirus
from touching something
is now really really really small is
that your understanding as well
and it seems obvious because if you
could get coronavirus by touching
common surfaces i feel like we'd all
have it by now
i mean i don't put on gloves to use the
atm
do you who puts on gloves to use the atm
i don't put on gloves to open the door
although i do use my elbow as much as
possible
i must i must have touched a hundred
thousand things
that a hundred thousand people have
touched
and if you can get it from touch and
stuff in public
i would have coronavirus for sure
so you know science is now confirmed
this is my understanding anyway so i
don't think i'm wrong about this but
science has confirmed that the odds of
getting it from a surface
is really really small so that's good
news
how can you guarantee guarantee what
that it's not a great reset
naive fool somebody says to me
you naive fool
scott is bought and paid for
i wish somebody had you know the
the probably the single value
that i have to you probably one value
that's
you know above the others is that um
you can pretty well depend on me not
being
bought off it's sort of the one thing
you can be sure of
i could be right or i could be wrong but
you can be sure i'm not bought off
because it's the advantage of being you
know already rich
how much would somebody have to pay me
to lie
in public i've no i've never priced it
but what would you think like what would
be an amount of money i would take
to lie in public a million dollars
i wouldn't take a million dollars to lie
in public because i have
you know i've got a few million dollars
right so i didn't really need
another one it wouldn't change my life
well what what would be the amount that
somebody would pay me to lie in public
would i lie for a billion dollars well
nobody's going to offer that
it wouldn't matter you know you could
imagine that i would say yes to that
but nobody's going to offer a billion
dollars i don't know of any way to get
paid for anything i do if you do let me
know maybe maybe there's some money i'm
not making
but if there's any way to if there was
if there were any way to be paid off
for what i do i'm not aware of it
nobody's ever offered
by the way nobody's ever offered just
just in case you're wondering
um if you consider as much as i talk in
public
about politics and apparently it's
having
some impact nobody has ever offered to
pay me i'm not even an offer
so i didn't even know how does it happen
is there somebody does george soros need
an appointment
you know if i wanted soros to bribe me
you know do i make an appointment how do
you do that
ten thousand dollars per lie somebody
says is the going rate
yeah i don't think i would do that
um
you know it's funny that
i have i block certain keywords on
twitter so i don't have to see certain
kinds of trolls
but i haven't blocked the same keywords
on youtube so only on youtube there's a
whole
certain kind of troll that i stopped
seeing for a while
all right that's all i got for now
somebody asked me how's the e-bike the
e-bike's great
you should get one and i will talk to
you later
and you youtube people uh
thanks for hanging out with me sorry i
started this a little bit early
do i block and mask keywords i do on
twitter and i i think i have that
function here on youtube i haven't used
it as much
all right oh the nasal surgery uh
unfortunately the nasal surgery
will not be successful on me so i went
through that whole surgery
only to learn that i have a certain kind
of situation in which they're likely to
come back
so at the moment it's better than it was
but it'll just come back
so the surgery was not a success in the
long run
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you later
