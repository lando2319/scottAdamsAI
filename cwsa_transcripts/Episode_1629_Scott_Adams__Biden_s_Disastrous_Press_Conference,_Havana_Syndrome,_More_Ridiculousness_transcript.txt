good morning everybody and welcome to
that's right the best thing that's ever
happened to you in your entire life it's
called coffee with scott adams
is famous
well all over the world
and
you're probably here because you saw the
description
and realized that this would be the most
amazing live stream even better than the
best one you've ever had it's true and
all you need is a copper mug or glass a
tanker tells a sign i can't do jugger
flags a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
it's a dopamine hit of the day it's the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip go
all right
well for those of you
who are my local subscribers you know
that last night i revealed to you the
secret for authoring the simulation
yourself
many of you are trying it
if you're on youtube i'm sorry that was
for local subscribers only
meanwhile rasmussen has a poll
in which one of the questions was they
asked has washington become more or less
partisan in the past year
do you think that you that anybody's
going to answer
less partisan
78 said more partisan
and it's kind of weird that
we've drifted into a place was it newt
gingrich who was the
the the first one to make this i think a
change
which is that one party would do nothing
but stop the other one from succeeding
and and that's it
just yeah
that's right 25 say it's becoming less
partisan
approximately 25
you caught that one before i did
but was it newt gingrich was that where
everything changed where he got the
republicans to hold tight
that's about right right
so
i don't know it's like we have a
government that
it no longer even pretends they're
trying to do stuff they're only
pretending like they're trying to win
tip o'neill was tough but he was a deal
maker right
tip o'neill was very much a deal maker i
think
yeah okay
let me ask you this
uh in the comments let's see where your
current knowledge is don't look at
anybody else's comment
so before you see what somebody else
says
tell me the uh
daily number of deaths from covid in the
united states
the current number the daily
how many people died on average in the
past week in the united states give me
the number let's see if you know the
number
oh very educated group
wow
very well informed
very good yeah it's around 1500 i think
it's closer to 1700 but i would take
anything in the 1000 to 2000 range as
well informed
surprising
congratulations
and nicely done
i like it when
people follow me are unusually well
informed i don't think the i don't think
the general public could have answered
as consistently as the comments are here
i don't think so
um
but here's my second question
of the roughly 1700 dying per day from
either from covet or with go but that's
still an open question but what
percentage of them do you think are
under 75 and reasonably healthy meaning
they don't have a comorbidity so on the
1700
tell me the number that are under
75 and don't have you know let's say
obesity or comorbidity
well you're just guessing now aren't you
yeah you're just guessing
you don't know
i don't know
do you know why you don't know and i
don't know
i don't think it's reported
now the cdc does
does track by comorbidities and age
but
i think they're doing it by a rolling
month
in corona's virus time a month
that's that's like a lifetime right in a
month you could have a whole new wave
or you could have a whole wave disappear
in a month so if you're looking at a
rolling month
it's concealing any improvement
am i right and you also have to dig into
each age group and stuff so it's almost
as if
it's intentionally concealed from you
does it feel that way
does it feel like the most relevant
number
is intentionally being concealed
it's not
hidden hidden completely like you could
suss it down if you really worked at it
but it looks like they're trying to not
let you know what that is
what is your obligation to comply to
mandates in terms of the coronavirus
what obligation do you have when you're
when your government is intentionally
not giving you the most relevant data
yeah zero exactly
yeah there is no obligation
whatever moral or ethical obligation you
believed you might have had this would
be the sort of the cnn howard stern view
of things
that you know you've got to be a good
moral person to get vaccinated
well if your government who is asking
this of you
is not going to give you the most
relevant number
which they have
they have the number they're not giving
it to you
you have no obligation you have no moral
obligation no legal obligation no
obligation to your fellow citizens no
obligation you are free of obligation
because of that
and
february 1 we are done
the government might take a little while
to catch up but i think the pretty
privileged people will lead us
the people who are attractive will stop
wearing masks
and then the rest of us will be able to
do it
it makes sense that pretty people would
go first because people don't ask them
to put masks on
uh and secondly
uh it makes more sense for them to take
a mask off
you know people like me
i actually i actually benefit a little
by keeping the mask on because you don't
see this this half of my ugly face
but the pretty will the pretty will lead
us as they should
well um
so these senate democrats got defeated
as everybody knew trying to change the
filibuster rule so that they could get
i guess voting rights stuff as they call
it past
and
senators mansion and cinema
once again became the only ones that
mattered
one of my better uh predictions was that
manchin would actually be running the
country because he was the only one
willing to be a swing vote if you're
willing to be the swing vote you get to
run the country
and he was i felt like he was the only
one and i think i think cinema is a
slightly different
question i'll talk about that
but
why was nobody else smart enough to know
that all they had to do was be flexible
and they'd be in control of the united
states
he was the only one that figured that
out
now maybe he's the only one who had the
flexibility to do it or something
yeah that's that's true as well
but it feels like there was an obvious
play
that he
that he
uniquely stands out in taking
now
cinema
i can't say enough good things
about the way she played this and
mansion two
so let me let me say this as uh
as
let's say aggressively as i can
i always
protect the system over the
individual result
never destroy the system
to get an individual outcome that would
be dumb
it seems like cinema
is essentially protecting the entire
republic
because if you make this kind of a
change for this one thing well then it's
in play and it'll always be made for
everything and then everything just goes
to
now
i i honestly i just can't say enough
good things
about somebody who would willing to
go against their own party
and to protect the republic
to protect the republic
how do you feel bad about that
i mean right now
if if if cinema ran for president
i'd have a hard time not supporting her
because i'm always gonna i'm always
gonna back the system over the
individual decision
now i don't know anything else about her
so that's not like some kind of a
decision or something but this is
serious presidential here
not like this is serious
presidential quality
that's what i want i don't care what her
party is
because she you know she voted against
her party so i mean that shows some
independence
now i i you know with this crowd i know
it's hard to hear me say that i might
uh back
somebody on the left
but uh let me state it let me state it
more definitively
if it's the best candidate i would back
the candidate on the left
i know you don't want to hear that but
if it was the best candidate i could do
it easily
it wouldn't be any problem at all but
it'd have to be somebody who wanted the
system to work let me give you some more
examples of what i think that would look
like
and i'm not suggesting this and more
mansion would have these views but it's
one i'd like to see you know my view
that abortion will never be
decided because we'll always be fighting
about it
so if you can't decide what's right but
yet you have to decide
and you can't get everybody to agree but
you have to move on yeah you have to you
have to get past it somehow
that you the default is to default to
who decides
it's the thomas soul view that if you
can't decide what to do because nobody
will agree
you can still you know argue it
you can still fight it all day long and
of course you should if if you think
it's important
but if you can't decide and get
everybody on the same side you have to
default to protecting the system
so
who is the best deciders
well i don't think the president should
ever be involved in abortion
that's my opinion and here's why because
the president of the united states
should never have any say
in who lives or dies unless it's a war
situation really
but that just shouldn't be the president
states
somebody's got to make a decision
so you want to drive those kinds of
decisions as low down into the process
as possible as close to the individual
and their doctor as you can get it
because that's a better system
you know it's more likely to be
sustained so i think there are a whole
bunch of things like
how we do omnibus bills and how you do
the veto and
how do you run how do you run elections
do you have a transparent election or
not so there's just tons of stuff
where i'd love to have a leader who says
you know what we're never going to agree
on this stuff
so i'm not even going to make it my job
to tell you what's right i'll just make
it my job to make sure the republic
stays strong and let you guys argue it
out
you know once the public comes up with a
decision maybe maybe 75 percent of you
want the same thing
then the system will give it to you but
i'm going to make sure the system is
there
so that when the public decides what it
wants
becomes well informed
forms a consensus that that will happen
within the structure that can support
you i won't be the one who breaks the
system
so that even if you made a good decision
or one you're happy with
you couldn't be implemented anyway
so i think i feel like somebody could
make that case and win on that but maybe
not maybe it's too intellectual
the the public doesn't like anything
that they have to think about too much
you know they prefer
operating under fear and you know hoaxes
and that kind of stuff
uh
here's some cnn fake news
um so here's how they handle the fact
checker with biden
so daniel dale as cnn does the fact
checking and to his credit although the
item on the
cnn page was it was small i believe it
was one sentence
just sort of hidden down at the bottom
in the middle
that
by the way
by the way we we we also did some fact
checking on biden's press conference
yeah there there were in fact a number
of false statements
but
nothing to see here just look away look
it's trump look look over there is trump
look everybody
can you believe that
so that's what cnn's doing the old
don't look here there's nothing to see
but then daniel dale goes on
to say that indeed uh biden said a bunch
of things that weren't true you probably
are aware of them all i don't need to
have to go through
but he said a bunch of things that
weren't true but then daniel dale was
quick to say
that biden's lies while dozens dozens
dozens of lies
that trump had
thousands
and that you could not compare
the mere
dozens of lies
told by biden i mean it's just dozens
how do you compare dozens
to thousands
do you see any trouble with the way he
is uh presenting that data
does any error in analysis
jump out at you
how many times has biden spoke in public
right
versus how many times did trump speak in
public
and now let me ask you this
when they say trump told thousands
of lies or failed the fact-checking
do they mean that he told thousands of
individual
different lies on different topics
is that what that means
did trump really tell
thousands of unique and different lies
or did he tell something closer
to dozens of lies
that he repeated more often because he
talked more often and tweeted more often
it seems to me
that daniel dale is trying to get away
with comparing
one lie repeated three times and count
that as three
where if biden doesn't speak in public
as often
he gets a one because he only talked
once
is that what happened here
i think so right
give me a fact check
that's exactly what happened here right
they compared dozens to thousands as if
that was actually a fair comparison
that's fake news
i fact check your fact checkers and find
you fake
stamp
um here's some more fake news
um
leticia james the attorney general
says her office her office as a car
uncovered quote
significant evidence
quote indicating that the trump
organization used fraudulent or
misleading asset valuations to obtain a
host of economic benefits including
loans insurance coverage and tax
deductions
and michael cohen who presumably was
privy to any of those discussions he
says he was you know deeply in the
inside he was trump's attorney
and when asked on cnn to give an example
of this egregious and illegal very
illegal
asset valuation stuff
what was the best example that michael
cohen could come up
with because he did he came up with a
pretty specific example
of trump inflating his property values
what was the context
in which trump
inflated his property tax taxes so not
property taxes his property values what
was the context
according to michael cohen this is this
is not me
michael cohen said the context was
to make sure he looked better on the
forbes
ford
fortune 500 list
that was the argument
that when he said what his net worth was
for publicity
in forbes just for publicity
that he allegedly inflated the values of
his properties
to say that he had a few billion more
dollars
but when he did other things
that maybe were getting a loan or
insurance
he would give them something closer to
the actual value
because that's what you have to do
because that's the law
can you believe that we got this
far and that's all they have
they don't have anything well according
to michael cohen who would be the
closest to the actual reality according
to michael cohen they literally have
 nothing
that he lied to forbes magazine
do you know that forbes magazine also
reports my net worth
do you think they got it right
no
how how how in the hell would forbes
know my net worth
think about it
let me think about it how in the world
would anybody calculate my net worth
like they know what i've invested in in
the last 30 years
really
forbes knows how i invested in the last
30 years
it knows my you know
uh
my uh
what happened with my marriages
and knows that of course not
so the forbes fortune 500 thing is
publicity for forbes
and that's how you should see it i mean
it's fun it's like a horoscope basically
it's just entertainment so something
that's just publicity for a magazine
which trump wanted to get some publicity
for himself
so it's a double publicity situation
which everybody in the modern world
understands is hype hyperbole
i mean that's how getting attention
works you're a little hyperbolic pr
and that was compared to the legal
process where you're getting a loan or
you know paying you know property tax or
whatever
wow if that's all they have this is one
of the biggest hoaxes
of all time now i'm not saying that is
all they have but let me go down to
another level
suppose you were
trying to value your own properties to
get a loan
okay you want to value your own
properties to get a loan and you own a
bunch of hotels
one way to do it would be to take your
cash flow
and multiply it by a multiplier so you'd
say i've created this much cash flow or
this much profit
and you might multiply it by say five
i'm not sure what the multiple is for
real estate what's the multiple for real
estate
if you saw a commercial property
that was giving off i'll give an example
a million dollars a year in net profit
what would you pay for it if you were
gonna buy that five times right
somebody says eight
somebody says ten i don't think you'd
pay ten
would you would you ever pay 10 but
anyway the point is there's a multiple
it doesn't matter what the multiple is
so you'd say you'd say to yourself up my
net profit last year
i'll multiply it by five
now could you support that number
if somebody challenged you legally
would would that be a supportable number
your most recent year's profits
times five
would it
well then then you would have to add the
value of the property
right because it's not just it's not
just the uh because you also own the
property
so and then you subtract your loan
values and blah blah blah so
that would be one way to calculate now
suppose instead of taking the most
recent year and multiplying it by five
you say to yourself you know every year
is up and down it's unpredictable so
instead of taking the most recent year
as my most representative
i'll take an average of my last five
years or less three would be better i'll
take an average of my last three years
and i'll multiply that by five
and that might be very different than
just taking the last year multiplying by
five is that legal yeah yeah because you
have a good reason for it
it's legal if you have a good reason
that's it that's the whole standard
if you if an accountant or a lawyer can
come and say well here's my reason
you don't go to jail for that it might
be reversed
but if an expert says it's perfectly
good reason
you disagree i get that
but my reason was okay that's perfectly
legal
now suppose he said instead i'm going to
look at comparables
i'm going to look at my property
compared to other things nearby that
sold recently
that's entirely subjective
because you have to decide what is
comparable and there's never anything
comparable
you know a specific hotel doesn't really
have a comparable
no there's nothing just like it
you know you could do square footage and
stuff but it wouldn't be the same hotel
the same level of the same level of uh
accouterments etc
so you basically have a huge
subjective
ability to say okay i think my hotel is
just like that one across the street
but you could have said no it's not
really like that one across the street i
think it's more like the one down the
road
and then completely legally
you can give yourself an evaluation that
could be way higher or way low
completely legal
there's nothing illegal about that you
just have to be able to back it up
now those are just a few examples
but trust me when i say there are more
ways to do this
that are also
completely legal and you can use
different methods for different contexts
so if you're doing it for pr you can
just make up some numbers it's totally
legal if you're doing it for the bank
you better you better be able to back it
up but it could be anything all over the
place you know what you can even you
could even say this
i believe this would be legal i would
need a i would need an opinion on this
but i believe trump could say
i just got elected president
so i think the value of my properties
will go
way up or way down
and just say well you know there is this
external event it could have been you
know
climate change could be anything some
some external event
and this external event will make my
properties be worth half as much
or twice as much
could he back that up
yeah yeah you could back that up because
you say look we know that my value
property value will be wildly different
because of all this attention as
president
so i don't think it's going up i'm going
to cut it by half
what actually happened to the values of
his of his holdings while president well
you know the coronavirus killed
everybody but before coronavirus
i think it was down right
so if he had predicted that the value of
his property was
half as much as before he became
president
would that be illegal
half as much maybe it's too
that's a little too far but there's a
great deal of subjectivity in these
things and from what i've heard so far
they've got nothing on them like
literally nothing
if they had anything
you don't think michael cohen would have
given us that example here's what it
would look like to do it illegally
to say let's call this property you know
worth a billion when you know it's worth
3 billion and you don't have any
argument for why it would be worth 1
billion
that would be illegal
no argument if you have no argument for
it that's illegal
it's not even alleged
what i described is not even alleged so
far at least publicly we don't know
all right
doc anarchy on twitter
did a great thread on mkultra
and i didn't know that much about it i
mean i knew the basics but here's some
things that he puts in a thread it's
very recommended you read this
so there were projects bluebird and
artichoke began in 1951
and this is uh in doc anarchy's words
the cia set out to under to determine if
they could control the human mind
and
they use morphine addiction with forced
withdrawal
hypnosis and lsd so those are some of
the things they tried to control minds
and then doc anarchy says the project
failed
uh
in usual government fashion in other
words they didn't find something that
wouldn't control people's minds
uh-huh
didn't they
are you telling me that the the reason
they closed it down is because they
didn't find something that would control
people's minds
so they tested hypnosis
and and they can they concluded that you
couldn't control minds
no that didn't happen
let me tell you what didn't happen
what didn't happen is they tested
hypnosis and found and it didn't work
that didn't happen now i don't know if
they
if they thought it wouldn't work in the
way they needed to because some some of
what they were testing is to see if you
could change somebody in real time like
really quickly
so hypnosis isn't necessarily going to
work for that but if you were trying to
move the masses
oh yeah
oh yeah the hypnosis and knowledge of
persuasion in general would totally do
that
so
i'm a little skeptical that they didn't
find a way to do it since one of the
things they listed would do exactly that
but like i said it wouldn't work maybe
the the hour that you tried it
um
so anyway redress that threat it's it's
shocking what horrible things the cia
did allegedly
as part of that program
so let's talk about
the president biden's press conference
i'm going to lean into it with a
jonathan turley piece
on the voting rights thing
that
he so he has a piece in the hill
now if you're not familiar with jonathan
turley
strong recommendation that you follow
him on twitter and and read anything he
writes basically he he's in this teeny
teeny group of people
that anything you write you should read
it
just just whatever it is just read it
just trust me i'm not even going to make
an argument for it just just trust me
just read anything he writes is that
good
and he's he's talking about
how biden and the democrats are pushing
what he calls their own big lie
basically pushing for voting rights
that rarely gets explained
why do you think it is that the news is
not informing us
what's in this alleged voting rights
bill
do you know why the public doesn't
really know what's in there
because if they knew
they wouldn't support it
so of course they don't know
so by calling it a voting rights bill it
gives them the democrats the ability to
say the the republicans are racist
because they don't support voting rights
but
let me tell you what it looks like
it looks like the voting rights thing is
a cover for the the democrats planning
to rig an election
now i'm not saying the rich and the
elections have been rigged
i'm saying that the most obvious
explanation for why this would be their
top
priority
when it's basically nobody's priority
if you actually look at what the problem
is that they're trying to fix it
wouldn't be anybody's priority
really
and they're making it their top priority
why would they do that
now of course they have the news
organizations to back them
the only thing the only reason i could
think of for why they would do this is
to prime the public
for them stealing the next election
because if they've made the news all
about stopping the republicans from
stealing elections
that's how you cover your own
shenanigans so you go first
and make a really big deal about
accusing the other side of what you're
planning to do in a month
now
i'm saying that we could confirm that's
what's happening
but i've never seen a clear
indication
in fact if
absent of any confirming
or debunking information and we'll never
have that probably
your starting assumption should be that
the big lie as
jonathan turley calls it the big lie
that the republicans are trying to stop
voting rights because they're going to
rig an election
that's almost a guarantee that they're
telling you they're going to rig an
election
i mean it's not a hundred percent
but it's really close
i don't know how it wants to interpret
it because we've seen this play so many
times that now you recognize it right
they blamed uh trump for colluding with
russia
and it made it invisible cognitively
invisible
even when it was proven beyond any doubt
that the democrats were
working with russia
to change the outcome
of the election
that's that's proven guaranteed
documented and nobody even disagrees
with the facts and we still don't deal
with it like we just saw democrats
colluding with russia
your brain can't kind of hold that in
there because they did such a good job
of making you think that russia
collusion is just something trump may or
may not have done
it's it's really effective
i would say this is mk ultra
i would say
this is the output
from mk ultra
i believe if they studied hypnosis they
knew that they could do this and now
they're doing it
this looks like exactly what one would
learn
if one were
studying how to move crowds now again
there's a difference between moving an
individual and moving a crowd it's a
different technology
but i i mean it's right in front of us
and you know i realize i'm in conspiracy
theory
we're in conspiracy theory territory so
let me say it this way we can't confirm
that's what's happening
i couldn't do that
but i think given the
history
it's
you can't rule it out
i mean you have to almost act like it's
it's the default assumption at this
point
so let me tell you some of the things
that jonathan turley called out about
this so-called fighting voting rights
act
and here are things that uh biden has
said about it
uh according to turley he falsely and
repeatedly claimed for example that the
georgia law
which he described as jim crow on
steroids sought to reduce ours to vote
the law does the opposite
it actually increases the hours to vote
just think about that the president of
the united states
is one of his biggest things
is to stop this
jim crow law on steroids in georgia
which is literally
demonstrably
easy to fact jack
the opposite of what he said
and it's not even an opinion
nobody would argue it if they just saw
what the law said there's there's no
difference of opinion but he says it
anyway
because people aren't going to check
what the law says
right
so that's how it works
uh he also says
uh he would know he's backed away from
this but he used to falsely claim
according to turley
uh
that uh of questioning whether ballots
would be counted saying that
not as to who can vote but who gets to
count the vote that counts
in other words he used to be saying what
trump said
that we can't trust our own elections
because it's about who counts the votes
think about that at the same time he's
trying to sell us
that the 2020 election was completely
fine
he's also saying that who counts the
votes is the only thing that matters
but wisely he backed off from that
for the obvious reasons
um
let's see uh
oh and then he says that a lot of things
that the democrats have alluded to as
problems have actually been
adjudicated in courts and the courts
found them to be
so basically you have a law that's
as it's being described
is completely mis
misrepresented by the people promoting
it
and based on things that the court has
found aren't even real
and then one of the biggest ones is that
it wants to
avoid
i guess it's trying to block voter
identification with id
and 80 percent of the public is in favor
of the thing they're trying to block
80 percent can you think of anything
else that the public is in favor of by
80 percent
and to this day we have never met the
one voter who wanted to vote and
couldn't figure out how
not one
not a single
living human being has come forward and
said you know
the way things are now
i can't figure out how to vote and i
want to
not one
so
i think you have to see the voting
rights thing as a complete fraud and a
diversionary tactic
from a party that is losing badly now
let's talk about all the
uh
things that happened with his speech
so i guess uh this
gentleman clint ehrlich was on tucker
carlson last night i didn't see it but i
saw his tweet thread about it and oh my
god you have to see this thing
he did this beautiful tweet thread
showing the crazy responses
to
i guess he was on tucker and he was
probably um
fact jack me but i assume the context
was that he was
not in favor of going to war with russia
was that fair to say over over ukraine
right
so i think tucker and his guests were
against going to war with ukraine the
reactions to that from the democrats
were just batshit crazy
i mean they're just crazy but you can
see in them all of the tells for
cognitive dissonance you've got the mind
readers
like their opinion is based on reading
somebody's mind and seeing something
crazy in there that isn't there
you've got the people who just insult
them
with no point they just insult him the
ones who do the oh why don't you kiss
putin well if you love putin so much
like what
what
why does not wanting to go to war with
somebody that you don't have a reason to
go to war with how is that like you're
in love with putin and you're supporting
them like these are just crazy comments
and when you see them you can see what i
deal with every day which is if you say
something reasonable
uh in public
it will trigger massive cognitive
dissonance and you get you get this kind
of response but to see them all together
is pretty fun
all right let's talk about his press
conference biden i'm going to tell you
what he did right
first okay
so i was listening to it in my car
and when you don't see biden you don't
see him looking frail you just hear his
voice so my first observation is he
sounds better
when you don't see him
have anybody noticed that
if you just listen to his voice it's
actually much stronger
than the visual
so
part of me thinks oh you know if you
didn't watch him
you might have a different opinion about
how
how he did so that was my first thing is
that when i listened to him he was much
stronger when he was doing his prepared
uh his prepared stuff
and he was defending some things he was
being attacked for i thought he actually
did a strong job i'm going to get to the
things he did wrong and they're pretty
massive but but i want to start by
saying that
i thought that his persuasion game
if you don't count the gaffs which were
horrible
but if you don't count the gaffs
his persuasion game was really good
it was really good i mean there were
prepared comments that you you know
people may have told them what to say
etc but let me give you some examples
you're worried about inflation as of
course you could so here's his defense
to it which i found
you know incomplete but but judged only
as persuasion
not bad he had an answer for it
he said that
he said what do you say about inflation
oh he said for example that it's global
and that's actually a pretty good
argument
if he says wait inflation is global
then you think oh wait maybe it's not
because some of with some of his own
policies now of course it's because of
some of his own policies but it's a
really good defense that is global
because he didn't he doesn't tell you
what's the difference
between the global inflation and his
so if you don't know that there's a
difference and i don't i didn't look it
up it sounds convincing oh it's a global
thing it can't be you so that's a good
defense if forget about whether it's
true i'm just saying if it's a good
defense then he said that cars are a big
part of that
and the cars are super expensive but it
comes down to we can't get chips
and that he's working hard
to bring chip making back to the united
states so there he actually turned a
negative into a positive
oh it's you know china won't give us
chips
and
if you knew that it was china or taiwan
or wherever they're coming from i don't
even know where they're coming from
actually
but we don't have them but you think oh
this is going to be a reason for us to
build our own chips
for a while it'll be expensive but it'll
just go away because then we'll have
cars so he turned that into a positive
pretty well and then he blamed the
pandemic for the rest so i'm not saying
that he
he passes the fact check
right when i look at this thing there
there are three levels
i look at are the policies he said good
is he lying you know the fact check part
and then is he persuading and they're
all different
on persuasion he actually did a pretty
good job on the inflation question now
the fact check
i don't think he passes the fact jack
but persuasion was pretty good
also
when he started talking about russia he
did a good job
he completely screwed the pooch later
we'll talk about that but when he first
started talking about russia
he said very close to what i used to say
that they're they're asking for
he didn't say it this way so i'm
paraphrasing
but he sort of sort of said that they
were asking for reasonable things
that we wouldn't bother giving them
anyway
for example
we don't think ukraine will ever be
uncorrupt enough to be in nato
at least for so long that you don't have
to think about it
so russia wants to guarantee that
ukraine won't join nato
and we don't think we want them in nato
anyway
but there is a difference between being
forced to say you won't do something in
the future
you know versus saying well i wasn't
going to do it anyway
how hard would it be to make a deal
if we don't want to do the thing they're
asking us not to do
it should be really easy to make a deal
on that point do you know how you do it
you just say oh okay we agree not to
allow ukraine into nato
what happens if you change your mind
someday
you just break the agreement
right
the only reason you would need to break
an agreement there was a military
agreement was for pretty serious
military reasons
if not having ukraine and nato worked
out fine
well why would we break the agreement
if it didn't work out
and it became a military
necessity to put ukraine into nato
well we would just break the agreement
because military agreements we break
every day i mean i'm exaggerating but
anybody would break a military agreement
if if keeping it made them susceptible
am i wrong
is there any is there any country that
would
that would not break a treaty if their
national defense was
legitimately
at risk
i don't think
i don't think any country would so how
could we not make a promise about
ukraine
that of course we could change
if the situation changes of course you
could change your mind so so i thought
that his take on that was spot on
that how could we not make a deal on
that now what was the second point
remind me was it putting offensive
weapons or defensive weapons in ukraine
there was a second point about
not just ukraine but maybe
the neighboring countries
putting offensive weapons there and i
thought to myself
do we really even need any of that
like how how militarily
necessary is any of that stuff
so when he described
the the fact that there's actually no
reason to be at war with anything i
thought he was spot on now
later he uh blew it we'll get to that
um i thought he also did a good job of
in the beginning showing that he was
strong and he was bragging about how
long he would go and he would go longer
than the
reporters themselves and stuff
but i did detect
as others noted a little bit of
sundowner toward the end did anybody
else detect that
did anybody watch the whole thing
so you can see how he starts strong and
he's definitely weaker at the end
yeah most of you can see it
and at one point somebody asked the
question a reporter asked
what do you do with the fact that even
democrats
i don't know this is true but i feel
like the reporter said
that the
even democrats think he was cognitively
impaired
and how did he answer the question
why do even your own team think you're
cognitively impaired
and he said
i don't know and took another question
that was painful to watch
did you have the same impression it was
a little painful to watch
because he didn't even have an answer to
why his the people who know him best
like he's cognitively impaired
that's
you know i think the answer i don't know
might have been more honest
than we give him credit for he might not
be
processing this right
no no
all right one of his biggest gaffes was
essentially indirectly admitting that
the 2020 election he won was unfair
now the reason he wants to do
voting rights is that he believes that
if he doesn't do this
republicans will use legal means
to
win the election
legal means in other words whoever it is
that controls the rules in
a local election
you know the state states in charge of
the elections
that
the states
if they don't pass the voting rights law
the states could make
legal completely legal changes that
would disadvantage democrats and
therefore be unfair
but
doesn't that indicate
that that was the case in 20
every other year before right 2020 and
before
thank you i i can go along today
so it seems to me that although and i
know and here's the pushback on this
point the pushback is that
the republicans are contemplating
specific changes that the democrats know
would make things unfair from their
perspective
but
isn't it a matter of public record
that the democrats and
maybe zuckerberg's money i'm not sure if
these are the same story don't we know
for sure that the democrats used the
pandemic
to get in place completely legally
a bunch of rule changes that advantaged
them and maybe won the election
so why would it be
unfair that the democrats used
completely legal means
to manage an election
that did it did in fact change the
outcome we would imagine
but why is it suddenly unfair if
republicans do exactly the same thing
now it's not the same changes
but they're a set of legal things that
you can do to change the structure of
how the vote is taken
why is one unfair and one is fair to me
it seems like he just admitted the 2020
election was rigged
but legally
because he's not saying that the
republicans are planning to do something
illegal
that's not part of the accusation he's
saying they're planning to do something
completely legal
that would disadvantage them
i don't know to me that's an admission
that his own election was uh
uh unfair
uh then he insulted his vice president
did you catch him insulting his vice
president
i've never seen this before i mean
actually it's something trump would do i
suppose because you know he would insult
anybody but
when asked how harris was doing in her
job this is what he said
about being a his running mate he said
she's going to be my running mate
biden said and then he went on to say
without being asked you think i think
she's doing a good job
a good
job she's going to be his running mate
and the best he could come up with was
good
um
is it just me
or is this a situation in which great
was the right word
i'm pretty sure
that this called for a great or terrific
or amazing or successful
do you know what it didn't call for
good
hey you're doing a good job
if your boss told you you were doing a
good job
would you go home all happy
i don't think you would
i don't think you would
i think you would go home and say better
take it up i don't even get a raise for
a good job
all right
then the russia gaffe which was the
worst
he said quote
talking about russia you know
threatening to go into ukraine he said
it's one thing if it's a minor incursion
and we meaning in nato end up having to
fight about what to do and uh what not
to do etc
and they said but if they actually do
what they're capable of doing it is
going to be a disaster for russia if
they further invade ukraine
and then somebody thought wait
it's only going to be a disaster if they
further invade them
wait what
if they
if they do a minor incursion
that nato might just be arguing with
each other and nothing would happen
did joe biden just invite russia
to invade
now
it looks like it doesn't
it kind of looks like he's inviting him
in well you know we'd just be arguing
about it i don't know what we could do
it's not a nato country anyway
now i don't think he meant anything like
that because later when he was asked to
follow up he did follow up correctly
by saying that you know there would be
massive financial implications of an
invasion
but man the way he worded it certainly
suggests that they would tolerate a
minor incursion
but here's the context i think he only
means tolerate it militarily
right
but that's not the threat i don't think
he's ever made a threat that he would
respond militarily
so if he says that nato you know might
not respond militarily
i think that's just true
i think the threat was always financial
but and then he
i thought i thought he did a good job
almost a trumpian-like job
of describing how bad the
repercussions would be financially i
think he did that well
because there's a real clarity there
which is if you do this
we will crash your economy and he made
sure they knew it wouldn't be temporary
he did a real good job of saying it
wouldn't be temporary we're going to
take you down for decades basically
i thought that was pretty good but in in
the long run
the gaff about
minor incursions
that's really hard to excuse
and that's a really big mistake
all right um
and biden is being hit with his own fine
people hoax which is in other words
something taken out of context to make
him look bad
uh the fine people hoax was caused by
removing the clarifier in trump's speech
and in this case
what
biden said was in a prior day he had
said something about let's see if i can
read the exact quote
he said at consequential moments in
history
uh they present a choice
do you want i think this is talking
about voting for or against the voting
rights bill so-called voting rights he
said do you want to be on the side of dr
king or george wallace
the president said do you want to be on
the side of john lewis or bull connor
do you want to be on the side of abraham
lincoln or jefferson davis
this is the moment to decide to defend
our elections to defend our democracy
and that was characterized
by fox news as
saying that if you
voted against the voting rights act that
biden thinks you're comparable
to these segregationists these bad
people like bull connor
and george wallace
now let me give you a tip on fake news
the word comparable
anytime you see the word comparable it's
a lie
in this context right in this context
comparable means that uh his enemies in
this case fox news
made up a hoax
essentially a mirror to the
fine people hoax but you know payback is
a and so they're going to say that
what he meant
was that if you're against it you would
be
comparable
to racists meaning that you'd be a
racist you'd be comparable
now is that what he said
did
did biden ever use the word comparable
no he didn't because that's not what he
was talking about
he was saying you'd be on the wrong side
is being on the wrong side
being comparable
there were many people in
let's use the universal reference there
were many people in nazi germany who
probably thought they had to play along
for
their own safety
were the people who were playing along
or had their own reasons
comparable to hitler
no
no but they were on his side
they were on his side
and what they were doing wasn't even
illegal i mean in the end
you know a lot of it wasn't illegal
they were just taken aside so his point
is you don't want to be on the wrong
side of history because you don't think
you're a racist and you don't want to be
accidentally on their side
that is not calling you comparable to a
racist i'm sorry
this is complete hoax
fox news i'm calling you out complete
hoax and anybody who supported the idea
that he was saying that you're
comparable to these people
uh that's a hoax now
completely fair
completely fair hoax because it is the
compliment or the mirror of the fine
people hoax in the same way that
trump was not saying
that everybody there was marching with
nazis
he was saying that you know they had
their own reasons for being against
statues
so in a way you could say they're on the
same side
but were they comparable
really was somebody who just saw history
is more important than offending people
is that person comparable to a neo-nazi
no
they're not comparable so whenever you
see the word comparable
you are being fake news
or
you should assume that and look for some
details you know maybe not every time
but that word comparable is a really big
flag for
and if you if you're wondering why i'm
so
worked up about that word comparable
it's because it's been used against me
a lot of times
i can't tell you how many times people
have made the comparable argument with
me
when comparable was the wrong word and
not what i said
so
absolute disgusting fake news
that i enjoy because it's the payback
for the fine people oaks
well
the cia has come out and said uh
that uh havana syndrome
and that secret sonic weapon idea are
not the result of sustained campaign by
hostile power in other words the cia has
looked into it and decided that there is
no sonic secret weapon
that anybody can detect
alright
how many people do you know who told you
on day one that this story was obviously
and every other day after that
obviously a fake news and it was clearly
mass hysteria
i only know of me
now there had to be other people right
there had to be but i only know of me in
terms of a a prominent let's say blue
check or or more in terms of a blue
check twitter person
i think i was the only one
that i saw
now somebody said green glenn greenwald
was all over it and i don't know if he
was but i'd be surprised if he if he
were not right because
he can sniff that out pretty pretty
fast
so i and i'm sure a lot of you maybe
thought it was bs
but
was i the most prominent person who put
myself out there
because i put myself way out there would
you agree
i i put myself as far out on a ledge as
you can be on a topic as clearly as
possible emphatically and i followed up
about once a month for i don't know two
years or whatever it was
to make sure you knew
that every time they said we got more
evidence it's a secret sonic weapon
every time i told you nope
nope you're seeing mass hysteria
every time
and
can you give me credit for this one
now i realize that i'm like asking you
to appraise me
i'm not i'm not blind to that but in the
context of what we do here we make
predictions
and then we see how good we are
i feel as if i should make a big deal
about this
because this was a
very non-standard prediction
one of my best by far
and it was based on a reason
the the reason i said trump would get
elected in 2016
is that i had a little extra insight
into the persuasion
uh level
so that helped me make that call with
the
with the uh
sonic weapon it's the same skill set
if you know what mass hysteria looks
like you see them right away
right if you haven't studied massive
stereos you might say i don't know a lot
of people say this is happening i've got
doctors saying it's happening
it looks like it's happening but if you
studied mast hysterias it's just you see
it like that
it's really obvious
so all i'm claiming is not magic powers
i'm claiming that if you had a skill set
in persuasion
that this would jump out at you
now i i saw a tweet from uh uh mike
cernovich saying you know
i forget the contest basically something
like we should have known it was
i would guess that cernovich had this
peg this early on
why
because he has a skill set in persuasion
um have you ever heard trump say it was
real
think about it
has trump ever said the secret sonic
weapon was real
i don't know
but i'm gonna bet he didn't
do you know why
because he knows when he sees
it
he's really good at that
he's good at creating
but he's really good at spotting it you
know takes one to no one sort of thing
i think he spotted it on day one i don't
think he even once
talked about it like it was real did he
yeah
so
i don't know i think i think that's my
best work yet
um
let's talk about trans athletes
uh i will remind you that my take on
trans athletes when i wasn't just being
provocative because sometimes i was just
having fun
was that sports are broken not the
athletes
that the thing that needed to get fixed
was not what the trans athletes were
doing
is that the sport itself needed to be
adjusted so that people were always
playing people of compreh comparable
ability
however you get there
so the ncaa just announced a big change
in their trans policy
in which each particular sports national
governing body if you have one some of
them don't will be responsible for
determining transgender athlete
participation now on some on some level
they're you know just taking the
responsibility to other people but it
seems like the essence of it is that
each sport will decide how much it
matters
see what i mean so for example if
there's a i don't know
a skeet shooting sport
and nobody thinks that gender makes a
difference then that sport can say yeah
trans doesn't matter whatever you want
but if it's a boxing then the boxing
commission could say oh the physicality
matters
so we'll you know we'll make some
adjustment now this is not exactly what
i was talking about when i said sports
need to be adjusted
and at the professional level and then c
double a level that's different
but
it's in the right direction
i think we have to realize that the
sports
are broken not the
athletes because just put them with
people who have the same ability why is
that a problem what you know why do we
have to have this artificial structure
when that creates some people get get
ribbons and awards and some people don't
i mean it's all kind of random
somebody says wrong
now the the only issue that i haven't
solved is how women
could still protect
their sport
right
so if you're talking professional sports
i actually don't really care
because professional sports are just for
your entertainment
so if it's just for your entertainment
well you'll let them work out what's
more entertaining and whatever they do
but if you're talking let's say uh
school sports let's take this high
school sports i think in high school
that's not it shouldn't be entertainment
that should be for the benefit of the
kids and the benefit of the kids is that
everybody gets to play a sport that they
like
with people who are comparable ability
because it's not entertainment
i mean not primarily
it's for the kids so just give them
teams they can play on however you need
to do that so that nobody gets hurt and
they play equal abilities
i think that's where it's heading
somebody says scott on sports is out of
his league
how hard is it to understand sports
really
i mean that is such cognitive dissonance
now do you imagine that
i didn't play sports or something i mean
i was i played like every sport
i would place three sports a day
typically three different sports a day
when i was a kid yeah and everybody
understands sports there's nothing
there's nothing mysterious about it
why no trans trying to pay men's sports
well who cares who cares
who cares about that question
as long as everybody's playing on the
team that's comparable
why does anything matter
so
um
i'm not
for or against trans playing in any
particular sport so let me
i don't know if this is a revision or a
clarification of what it is i'm not in
favor
of automatically saying
any trans person can play on any sport
just because they want to
would you be happy with that
which probably sounds a little different
from what i've said before
would you agree with this
that i do not support
uh trans people just getting to choose
the sport that they play on
i think the sport needs to decide not
the trans player
but
the only thing that i add to that is
that the sport needs to fix itself so
everybody can be accommodated
now if you couldn't do it easily
then maybe i wouldn't be in favor of it
because i don't think everything has to
change to accommodate everybody all the
time that would be crazy
but given that this isn't really a hard
change you know intramural sports
already solvent
if you wanted to play intramural sports
you would just find a team that was your
ability and you would just play on it
so trans don't have any problem with
intramural sports because i'm pretty
sure they could just find a team that
they fit on and then okay
and play
so
uh i will
i think i can support you this far which
should be all you need
this should be all you need
which is it shouldn't be up to the trans
athlete it should be up to the sport
are we good with that
would that be a compromise where you can
be comfortable with my opinion
it's not up to the athlete it's up to
the sport
now did you see what i did there
i favored the system over the decision
when i started this i was talking about
cinema supporting the system over this
specific decision
i'm using the same principle here
i want the system to work i don't really
care too much about the trans athlete
specifically you know they don't get the
choice of whatever they do i mean i care
about them having a sports play that i
want
so let me be clear about that i
definitely care
that every kid can have a sport if they
want to
that i care about because that's
important
but
i don't think they should get their own
choice all the time
all right ladies and gentlemen
i'm pretty sure this is the best live
stream you've ever seen in the history
of the universe
um
oh yeah biden yelling at reporters
that's fine and it looks like the uh
biden administration is
the most failing administration although
you still see arguments that he's
killing it and things are doing well you
can definitely always make an argument
that your president is
doing well or poorly
all right is there anything that i
didn't cover today let me
let me look at
i thought there was a way that i should
be able to look at the super chats after
the fact
but why don't they show up
is there a trick to it
i see it listed at the top but it's not
clickable
that's that boomer thing
crt please what is there to say about it
that we haven't already said
um
is the whisper yell effective yeah
yeah the whisper ale when biden does the
whisper
as as hokey as it looks
persuasion wise is actually pretty good
because you do you end up talking about
the thing he emphasized
so if trump did it if trump did it i'd
say it was a good technique i'll say the
same thing
yeah so carpe i saw your i saw your
super chats go by but i didn't want to
interrupt
and i was trying to get back to them and
if somebody could tell me is there
let me see if i i've got a problem down
here
top chats super chats oh okay i think i
have it
wait
uh nope that didn't do anything that
just made all your chats go away
i had separate super chat
and nothing happened
that's interesting
ah well
somebody could tell me how to make that
work it'd be great okay i'm going to uh
what do you think biden said they didn't
have mccain anymore to go to
um
i didn't have a thought about that
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
