good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
in your whole damn life it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and it features
to simultaneous sip which I know some of
you
try to skip some of you mute it and some
of you fast forward whoa what you're
missing
but that's okay because it's a free
world and you can get your vaccination
and you can not or you can listen to the
simultaneous sip or not
whatever works for you but if you'd like
to participate all you need is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea it's
like they can't teach your plastic
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
some of you are going to miss it oh I
pity you I pity you go
move computer
that feels like good advice
get removed
that's called responsive to the audience
a lot of podcasters they don't do that
they don't do that at all
right well today actually will be the
most exciting and awesome live stream
that you've ever seen in your whole damn
life I'm going to teach you a technique
which I mentioned often but the more
examples you see the better you'll be
able to do it in your own life it's
called The High Ground maneuver
it's the most powerful persuasion
technique
so powerful I've never seen it not work
now when I've used it in person I can't
tell if other people use it successfully
but it kind of works every time and
there's nothing like that in Persuasion
except you know maybe fear if you ramp
up the fear enough you can make anything
happen
but for a non-fear of persuasion The
High Ground technique it just beats
everything every time
and almost instantly you don't even have
to wait it's not like the simultaneous
sip where it's a small thing that
accumulates over time that's one way to
persuade The High Ground maneuver
instantly flips person people to your
point of view
and I'm going to give you some examples
as we go but first some fun stories uh
Rasmussen is a new poll says Biden's
handling of crime and law enforcement
issues
51 percent say he's doing a poor job on
crime in law enforcement how would you
like to run against any Republican
when you're underwater on crime and law
enforcement
kind of tough isn't it
yeah and I was I was actually surprised
that it's only 51 somebody just said in
the comments
uh Rasmussen also pulled people on
Biden's handling of immigration 54 say
he's doing a poor job on immigration
again
tough to run against a republican any
Republican
with these kinds of numbers
I don't know if you saw this next story
but
there's something going to happen
something's coming according to Rose
McGowan
now correct me if I'm wrong she started
the metoo movement right
am I right about that I think I am right
um and she just tweeted this I'm going
to read you the tweet
I'm going to read you the tweet
and unfortunately there's nothing you
can say about it
the Tweet just will sit there as its own
story there's nothing I can add to it
are you ready
this is from Rose McGowan I think it was
this morning or last night Hillary
Clinton you are a shadow leader in
service of evil you are the enemy of
what is good right and moral you
represent no flag no country no soul you
eat hope you twist Minds
I've been in a hotel room with your
husband and here comes the bomb
end of tweet
oh my God
oh my God
is Rose McGowan good at writing
and capturing our imagination
I'm just going to read this again
but only for the writing
okay
so you know the issue itself is just a
little red meat let's let's bring it on
let's find that way you know
but just listen to the writing
Hillary Clinton you're a shadow leader
in service of evil you are the enemy of
what is good right and moral you
represent no flag no country no soul you
eat hope you twist Minds I've been in a
hotel room with your husband and here
comes the bomb
I don't know if anybody's ever written a
better tweet than that
do you that is such good writing
ouch I mean it's good writing in the
context of a tweet right it doesn't mean
you're going to write a you want to read
a novel that goes like this man holy
holy holy hell
is Rose McGowan as smart as she looks
somebody do a little background check on
her
is Rose McGowan actually very high IQ
does she have some does she have some
qualifications does this writing just
screams high IQ
that's an old tweet
how old is the tweet
because it's being reported today oh
from oh September isn't that far away
so sort of old September somebody says
okay interesting I wonder why people
were talking about it today
anyway
um well that ruins it all
that makes everything Less Fun why was
it in the news today
you know one of the things that we one
of the mistakes I make a lot
is not checking the data on stuff
have you ever had that problem
Scott beggar Boomer today
all right
um
um
so Democrats as you know consider
climate change their biggest priority
biggest issue in the world is climate
change
and if you're a Democrat and you thought
it was your biggest issue in the world
who would you choose as your leaders
to deal with the biggest issue in the
world well
apparently two of the leaders in this
movement are Joe Biden of course and
then Greta tunberg and Greta just dumped
on Joe Biden
and she said
she insulted his leadership on climate
um
and I thought to myself
all right so you've got two people who
are identified as the main leaders on
climate the president who happens to be
a Democrat and
and Greta what do these two have in
common
well at Joe Biden's age I think it's
fair to say that his brain is past its
sell by date
fair to say would you say that Biden's
brain is degraded by age mostly
fair to say
Greta will somebody give me an update
what's her age what is Greta's age 21 or
something
is she only 18.
oh she's only 18 19. well she's so she's
18 19 right
um and your brain develops fully by the
time you were
fill in the blank your brain is
considered fully developed when you are
25 right 25 years old so the two leaders
on the biggest issue for the Democrats
are a man with a brain that is well past
its expiration date
and a young woman with a brain that has
not reached
maturity according to science
so the party of science
is using as their leaders to fight the
biggest scientific challenge according
to them
by picking the people that science says
don't have the capability to do this
kind of work
did I make up anything
is there anything in the story that I
just made up
no there's no question that Greta's
brain is not developed and I don't think
there's really any question that Biden's
at an age where things slow down
I mean that Dr Drew was saying last
night that even at his age and his age
is you know he's a little younger than I
am but we're pretty close uh but I can
feel it like I if I if I were to run for
a president I asked myself well you know
is age gonna have an effect on that and
I think it might right my capability is
much greater than it's ever been but
definitely age is starting to have an
effect
when I was younger I would have checked
the data in that Rose McGowan story
all right um
here's the big
here's a big payoff for today's show
uh I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a uh a
reframe
that you're gonna love
right by the way should I write a book
on reframing
just how to reframe everything
I'm seeing a lot of yeses for that
you know I worry that it would be too
repetitive of things I've done or
written before in various books but
there's something about the idea of
reframing how you see things
that by itself is very it's very
powerful yeah filters and frames
uh well I'm saying nothing but yes is
here okay I'm going to talk to my uh
my uh publishing people
in January and see if that makes sense I
really hate writing books
if if I read another book again it's
going to be for you it's not going to be
for me because I really don't like that
kind of work it's like three years of
your life that you you can't get back I
mean writing books is exactly as hard as
it looks
right yeah it look it feels like
sometimes it's easy because author will
come out with one every year and you
don't see them working you know they
work privately so it looks like it's
probably easier than it is but let me
tell you writing a book is as hard as it
looks it's really really hard
uh but I might write one for you because
I do think that the topic is just so so
useful
it's just so useful I'm not sure that I
could not write it you know what I mean
you almost have a moral obligation at
some point
so I'm starting to feel that pull
and I wish I didn't
all right here's the big reframe
when it comes to a citizen of the United
States
and let's say that citizen is accused of
a crime
do we accept the standard that that
citizen is innocent until proven guilty
how many would say that's a good
standard
anybody
yes not only do we universally accept
that innocent until proven guilty is the
best way to have a system but we also
accept as part of that and I want you to
confirm this we accept as part of that
that sometimes we'll get it wrong
meaning that a free a guilty person will
go free
and that we take that explicitly
as an acceptable trade-off
and that we've all thought about it
extensively and we've come to the
conclusion that because the government
is big and powerful
and a citizen is not
it would be deeply deeply unfair to have
it any other way the the citizen needs
some advantage against the entity with
all the resources and that is you'd
better damn well prove it
or else we're just going to treat you
like you're innocent
everybody agrees with that standard
right
it's one of the most basic pieces of
code that runs in your head
it's like a narrative that's like a
piece of programming and we all have it
in the United States anyway
all right so here's the problem
what happens when the citizens are
judging the government
so when the government is judging a
citizen innocent until proven guilty
just has to be the standard we all agree
but what if it's the opposite what if
the citizens collectively or
individually
are accusing the government of something
same standard
is the government innocent until proven
guilty
that's a terrible standard
let me give you some examples
if you have an election system
that can't be audited by Design meaning
the electronic parts you really can't
get at them
if your election system run by your
government
by your government
if the citizens buy some large number
and we're in this situation now have
questions about the fairness of the
election
where is the burden of proof
is the burden of proof on the citizens
to prove that the election was
fraudulent
I'm going to need a
dispensation here
I need to curse
permission to curse give you time to get
your kids out of the room
permission to curse I need permission
local says yes YouTube
permission
okay Josh says yes
foreign
election system is not auditable
that burden of proof doesn't work
if your election system can't be audited
by Design
the reasonable assumption is is
fraudulent
that's a reasonable assumption the
burden of proof
is on the government to prove it's not
see where I'm going on this
your government needs to prove the
election was fair not the other way
around every time your
critics tell you that you didn't prove
the election was fraudulent in court
 them they've got the wrong standard
the election needs to prove it's fair to
us we don't need to prove a
thing to the government
the government needs to prove to us the
election was Fair have they done
that and can they do that no they can't
prove it they won't prove it the
Assumption has to be
that it was fraudulent now I don't know
that that was true
because I I lack any evidence that would
prove it but the standard is backwards
it's a backwards standard
the government needs to prove it's a
it's a fair election and you
haven't
you don't get the Assumption of
Innocence you get the Assumption of
 guilt
that's the assumption
and that's the only system that can work
just as the only system that can work
when the government is judging an
individual
is the Assumption of innocent until
proven guilty
if you're going the other direction
it's got to be opposite
it's got to be opposite you've got to
 prove you're not screwing us
you've got to prove it and you haven't
you want another one
a lot of you have been getting on me for
being relatively quiet on the January
6th committee and especially the people
who are being held longer than we think
makes sense
I've looked at a number of the videos
now of the event and having looked at
the video I have come to the following
opinion
I don't know if the FBI was complicit or
or any other organization some outside
force in promoting the violence
I don't know that to be true
but if you watch the video
it looks obviously true
has anybody watched all the videos of
the unindicted co-conspiracers the the
ray Epps and the people with the bull
horns and stuff
now be careful be very careful have you
ever seen video mislead you
yeah yeah a lot in fact video misleading
you is the the number one thing that
makes our news
yeah and the the bad guys had matching
megaphones coincidentally and all that
so here's my take I don't know
because I can't prove that the FBI or
any other organization was behind
organizing this thing but
it's the video makes it obvious that it
is
like if the any if the videos are
telling the true story and that's a big
if
right you shouldn't trust physio in 2021
that's a big if but remember
is it my burden
to prove that this was a a legit I won't
call it legitimate is it my burden to
prove that it was just a bunch of Mega
supporters
or is it the government's burden to
prove that the obvious evidence of FBI
complicity is not what it looks like
again
same standard
don't tell me to prove that they
were not FBI agents not my job
if you're the government and it looks
like you're doing something to me you
better prove you didn't
you better prove there wasn't
any any stuff there now of course you
have the problem that you can't prove a
negative I saw that now in many
situations you can't prove a negative
but you can give us an interview with
 Ray apps
right you can find those people on that
video and tell us why they're not being
um investigated or charged you can do
that right that's that's miles away from
trying to prove a negative just just
give us the information from the people
on the video
how about that
we should not be trying to prove that
January 6th
was an FBI operation with all of that
video evidence the government needs to
prove it wasn't
the the burden of proof is just
backwards just backwards
and we've we've been hypnotized into
believing that the burden of proof is on
us it's not it's not the burden of proof
is on the government if they're
doing something that looks sketchy as
hell
they don't get to do that
right government doesn't get to be
sketchy as hell it doesn't get to do
things that half of the country says
that looks illegal to me
it doesn't get to do that
the people are in charge
flip your standard
the government's going to need to prove
that the crimes that are shown on video
are not real crimes
you're going to need to prove
why you've got these guys in jail
for so long has the government had
proven that they have a good reason to
keep the people in jail that for January
6. no you haven't proven that
you better prove it quickly
because our our patients
is about to run out
and we don't want to have to call Dad
but you know we can right
I don't have to tell you who dad is
you know who dad is
don't make us call Dad
you want a nice
you know maybe DeSantis presidency
maybe that's the best you can do if
you're a Democrat
you don't want Dad do you
but just keep with us with this
 about we have to prove that
your obvious crimes or at least the
inability to know if it's fair or not
don't put the burden of proof on US
Government you need to pretty much prove
you're not screwing us because it sure
looks like you are
sure looks like you are
anyway how could uh Trump guarantee that
he wins let me tell you
here's how how Trump could you know
there are no guarantees in this world so
a little bit of hyperbole here I think
you understand
close to proving
that or at least making the case that
Trump could win for sure let me tell you
what messaging he could use
to win for sure and this is where I'll
teach you about The High Ground
what has Trump been saying so far about
the 2020 election
he's saying that it was rigged and that
he really won and that he got cheated is
that The High Ground
does that sound like a high ground
position the election was unfair I can't
prove it but I'm sure I got robbed
no it's a child's frame
it's literally a child's frame
that doesn't convince anybody because
children are not persuasive unless
they're talking to their parents I guess
all right here's what he could say
instead of that
the system picked Joe Biden
and you have to respect the system but
it is absolutely Fair
for citizens to uh demand that the
election become transparent and if you
elect me I'm not going to complain about
2020 losing the elections because
frankly it's hard to tell
I do strongly think it's a possibility
even the probability but we don't have
the evidence because the system won't
allow us to audit it so instead of
complaining about the past can we unify
on this one question
the system needs to be more transparent
you need to be able to audit this thing
right away because you don't want to
repeat a 2020 and you don't want a
repeat of January 6.
see what I did there
That's The High Ground
who is going to complain about election
transparency
you can't
you can't complain about election
transparency who's going to complain
about letting the past behind us not the
criminal activity yet you still have to
prosecute criminals but who who would
complain was putting the past behind us
and being productively focused on fixing
the election transparency nobody nobody
would complain about that so that's The
High Ground
if you say that in a meeting let's leave
the past book behind
and except for the criminal Behavior
and focus on transparency of the
elections for next time
nobody can complain
you're done
um
how about uh
let's see we'll give you another one
um
how about vaccines so so Trump has a
issue with vaccines because he's
pro-vaccines but a lot of his base is
not so they would feel that that's some
kind of a
I don't know
incompatibility with them
so at the moment Trump is saying you
know you should get a vaccine and that's
that's a problem but we're probably
pretty close to being done with the uh
pandemic I'll talk about that in a
minute
and certainly by 2024 I don't think
we're going to be talking about the
pandemic
so I think Trump should handle it this
way
just by saying uh I like shots you
didn't like shots let's admit that we
were all doing the best we could and
guessing
let's just admit that nobody had all the
information that they wanted about the
long-term risks of the shot or the covet
and that we were all guessing and doing
the best that we could can we accept
that we did we all did the best we could
and move on
let's not let's not divide ourselves
over vaccinations and not vaccinations
especially when it no longer matters
because I think we're pretty close to it
no longer mattering
so I think Trump can make that go away
the vaccine Thing by saying you know I
don't know if I was right
I don't know if I was right to promote
vaccines but I'll tell you what
none of us had all the information we
wanted and you needed leadership
why you didn't need in a pandemic is
somebody saying I don't know what to do
is that what you wanted
that doesn't work you needed leadership
and we were all guessing I hope I
guessed right I did my best
how would you feel about that
I mean it's too wordy yeah you need the
shorter version of that that's right but
the point is that I think Trump can just
say you know nobody knew we all guessed
we did our best
let's accept that we all try the hardest
we could because I think that's true so
The High Ground is we all did our best
I don't think anybody put in less than a
good effort wouldn't you agree if you're
on the other side of this for me
whatever that looks like I don't know if
you're on the other side of this for me
I will accept that you did your best if
you can do that with me
and then just move on we've got other
things to fight about
all right
that's right John this is the best so
far and I even haven't even gotten to
the best part
I'm getting to the best part really soon
I saw a next kcd comic uh if you've
never seen XKCD highly recommended
there's stick figure Comics but they're
very smart
and this one was on Twitter somebody
tweeted it at me uh it was a statistics
teacher teaching the class and the
teacher said in panel one if you don't
control for confounding variables
they'll mask the real effect and mislead
you now in other words if you don't
consider all the variables in something
you're not going to get the right answer
makes sense right
and then the teacher goes on and said
but if you control for too many
variables your choices will shape the
data in other words you'll be picking
which variables to put in which really
makes it about you picking it's no
longer about statistics
so but if you control for too many
variables your choices will shape the
data and you'll mislead yourself
so you can't have too few variables
but you also can't have too many
but here's the The Sweet Spot as the
teacher goes on somewhere in the middle
is a sweet spot where you do both making
you doubly wrong
in other words you have too many
variables and not enough
[Laughter]
and then the the punch line is stats are
a farce and Truth is unknoble see you
next week
stats are a farce
the truth is unknowable
see you next week
that's the that's the only statistics
lesson You'll Ever Need
yes the truth is unknoble
so let me get to the good news
and I'm gonna I'm gonna paint the
picture slowly
so that we can enjoy it all right
Savor this
there won't be many times in history
when you're in a moment just like this
now I could be wrong because you know I
I I tend toward optimism
I tend toward optimism
but man am I optimistic right now
my optimism needle is just going crazy
here's what we know there's a study out
of South Africa saying that the Omicron
if you're infected with it it does give
you protection against
Delta
so in other words the Omicron
is a vaccination
now
hold on you're saying game over not yet
hold on it gets better
Biden talked to the governors yesterday
did anybody hear a readout of what
happened with that for some reason I
didn't see that I guess I didn't look
for it
but so you know Biden's talking to the
governors which makes me think that
there are probably at least noodling
with the question of when to end things
right
um
and
the Centers for Disease at the CDC
shortened the recommended isolation time
you know the quarantine time uh if you
have coveted symptoms from 10 days to
five if you're asymptomatic
why would the CDC do that why would they
lower it from 10 days to five now the
reason was that you're only highly
infectious for you know two or three
days
you think they didn't know that before
do you think they just figured that out
I'll tell you what it feels like
have you noticed that there are not
enough uh tests that it's almost
impossible it's really impossible to get
a Cova test right now
all right but start I'm giving you the
variables now start to assemble them in
your head all right
no access to tests
because the demand is so high so
basically zero access to testing
the Omicron is a vaccination against the
other things that's sweeping through the
country faster than anything we've ever
seen
quarantine just got reduced from 10 days
to five
what's the real reason
the real reason is if you can't get a
Cova test and you've got a sniffle
during cold season
and you can't get a test you can either
upset your life for 10 days
without even knowing if you had coveted
or you could just go on with your life
and say it's a cold which one are you
going to do
you're going to go on with your life and
say it's probably a cold because you
can't check and if it isn't a cold it's
probably Omicron and the difference is
Omicron you're lucky and if you give it
to somebody they should thank you
because you just vaccinated them
now now put all the elements together
why did the CDC go from 10 days to five
well it could be the new data that's
what they say
far more likely
they know that a rebellion is coming and
they know they can't they can't make you
stay 10 days if you can't get a test
they might be optimistic but wrong that
they can make you isolate for five days
without a Cova test
raise your hands if you would
raise your hands if you would isolate
voluntarily for five days if you
couldn't get a kova test how many of you
would isolate if you had a sniffle it
could be a cold could be Omicron how
many of you would isolate if you can't
get a test
look at the answers
do you see it yet
in two weeks we're going to have 30
million Americans with sniffles
some Omicron some regular colds I don't
know doesn't matter what the mix is
30 million people with sniffles and no
access to tests what happens then
the quarantine time didn't go from ten
to five
it just went to zero
because the public
won't manage that situation there's no
 way the public is going to
quarantine without access to tests now
who was it that up and gave us no
access to tests Trump
and Biden
yeah total fuck-ups
but those total fuck-ups really the most
criminal Behavior I think in the whole
pandemic situation was a lack of Rapid
tests to me that's obvious corruption
and by the way that's another situation
the the assumption is that the FDA is
corrupt because of the way that the uh
the tasks were handled
the the burden of proof has to be on the
government to prove that it wasn't a
corrupt decision again same thing right
I can't prove it was corrupt but it
looks like it in every possible way so
the government needs to prove it to me
let me ask you this to blow your
head off are you ready
you better hold on to the top of your
head
just hold on this this is going to
you up
have you ever seen an interview with
whoever's was in charge with the FDA and
the decisions about rapid testing have
you ever seen an interview with the
 who were responsible for
the rapid test no you haven't you
haven't even seen a interview
accident coincidence
nope
nope that is the dog not barking so
 loud you can't even hear
yourself think
those haven't even been on
an interview and how about your news has
your news been begging to talk to those
people to find out what's going on
nope
nope you don't have a news industry to
protect you if you had any kind of a
news industry that was functional
they would be surrounding the houses of
whoever made those decisions to you know
limit the rapid tests effectively
limiting them
it's the biggest question in the country
absolute no curiosity
absolutely no curiosity
yeah not even Fox right even even the
Press on the right it's just not even
touching it can you think of a more
important question than hey we better
get these FDA people in here to tell us
why they didn't do a better job on this
all right so uh as I've told you Feb one
the public is done uh I would be I don't
know if the Democrats have heard that
yet I don't know if that's reached the
White House you know there there's a lot
of uh use of it and it's starting to
make the rounds on right oriented media
but I don't know if the left is heard I
kind of doubt it uh however February 1
is looking pretty good
how many how many people think February
1 looks pretty good
for being out of the pandemic in a in a
serious way
yeah it's looking better and better and
I don't think as I've often said it's
not the government's they're just the
wrong tool to decide when it's over they
need to take the lead from us
they need to take the lead from us and
February 1 would be a perfectly
functional Target you know it's not a
left or right thing it just seems like
that would be about the right time
all right
um
is it my imagination or is the January 6
committee investigating the uh what
happened on January 6 is it the most
incompetent investigation of all time
so apparently uh Peter Navarro's book uh
explains exactly who is behind
everything and what they did
and as Jack posabic pointed out on
Twitter today
uh uh Steve Bannon every day on the War
Room his show was explaining exactly who
was doing what and why they were doing
it
so all this stuff that the January 6
committee is trying to investigate is
literally in a book and it was the
people involved want you to know
they want you to know all of it
there's no nothing's being hidden so
here's Peter Navarro's explanation to
see if I can summarize it basically they
had a hundred members of Congress lined
up
to support them when I guess
uh there was going to be a push to have
Pence delay the certification of the
election and just have some extra time
to look for fraud
now the plan
which apparently is well documented it
was public was to delay the
certification until we could be sure
there was no fraud
and it was explicit
it was always right out there and then
they did it in public
so they told you what they were going to
do they told you who was doing it and
then they did it in public
and there's an investigation
why do you need an investigation it was
done in public by people who told you
what they were going to do and then they
wrote it down really clearly so that
even after the fact you could read the
book or listen to the videos and find
out exactly what they did and why
so what exactly is the January 6
committee looking for I've never seen so
many confessions
like all the people who are involved
have already confessed
not only is they confessed they're
trying to sell you a book so you can see
the details
that's how legitimate it was it was so
legitimate that the people were accused
are like well I'd like to tell you as
much as you'd like to know I'll put it
in a book if you want I'll do a long
form video how about lots of long-form
videos on the war room it's like they
can't tell them enough information about
what they did as still an investigation
it's like no seriously I swear to you
I'm guilty I did that
all right we better investigate no I'm
guilty
I I've got documents I'll show you my
emails we did all of this it's us
and here's why
I don't know I think we're gonna have to
investigate this
better investigate this
well I think you can see at this point
the investigation is purely political
and uh by no means legitimate
um there is a conspiracy theory I want
to see how many of you buy into this one
okay
how many of you buy into this one
that the whole point of the pandemic the
motive was quote undeniable from the
beginning I'm reading a tweet I saw in
this today that total digital control
like Chinese style social credit was the
goal the pandemic was really just a
vehicle
for the powers that be to get us some
Chinese style
social credit how many people think
that's an accurate description of what
was going on
and would you be surprised if none of
that happens
would you be surprised if the pandemic
winds down and there's no vaccination
cards after that point and and nothing
seems permanent
would that surprise you in other words
if you believe that it was all sort of
uh orchestrated from some shadowy place
and that the the point of it was this
Chinese style social credit if that
doesn't happen
would that would that invalidate your uh
Theory
because remember I told you that the
best way you can tell reality is whether
it predicts
you know we don't really know what's
real and what's not but sometimes we
know that some theories or frames will
predict better than others uh my
prediction is
that we will not see anything
substantial
that looks like a move toward Chinese
social credit or some greater digital
control that wasn't going to happen
anyway
now keep in mind that my general
assumption is that complete lack of
privacy is guaranteed
uh that my working assumption for you
know 20 years is that a complete lack of
privacy is guaranteed
you know we'll get there in a variety of
ways and a variety of you know Trends
and technology and stuff but there isn't
a way to stop it that that's the most
Unstoppable force in the universe we're
going to lose all of that
but
uh I probably am completely alone in
believing that you won't necessarily be
worse off
necessarily you know it's easy to make a
story where you are and so if you don't
like that risk that makes sense but I
think that every time we've given up uh
a little bit of privacy
we got something in return
such as a really good online shopping
experience
so you do get things in return oh here's
another thing you get in return which is
a good credit score
if you had complete privacy you couldn't
get a loan
because well I suppose you could out
yourself but you know the fact that so
much of our activities are discoverable
makes a lot of our system work
unfortunately
now uh and I think that all of the let's
say the normalizing of
um non-standard sexual preferences
is making an entire category of things
you had to keep private irrelevant
you know a few decades ago if you were
gay you wouldn't want anybody to know
today
what if everybody knows you're gay
you get more job offers right I mean
there isn't a downside to it you get
more job offers that's exactly what
happens
so
um don't automatically think that loss
of privacy leads to a worse outcome it
could I mean that's an easy story to
make that it could
but every time it's happened
not every time I don't want to speak in
an absolute about this but the the
examples I can think of you've got
something pretty good for it in return
now in order for this to work
everybody has to lose their privacy
about at the same time
the worst situation is some people have
privacy and others don't that's
untenable you cannot have that you can't
have your leaders private and then you
not
that doesn't work now we might drift
into that situation which would be
terrible
but
if you're if if you're only talking
about conceptual level
you know without all the humans ruining
everything at a conceptual level
if our leaders were as transparent as
they want to make us
we'd probably come out ahead
think about it imagine if your leaders
were as transparent like you could just
know everything about where their money
is and you know what they're doing and
stuff
you're not going to have too much of an
issue with your government abusing you
because you just watch everything they
do you know everything they do the worst
case is the government keeps their their
own personal privacy and you lose yours
and we are having in that direction
we're sort of drifting in that direction
so I'm not saying that this is all roses
I'm just saying that if the only thing
you can imagine is it'll turn out bad
I think that's the least likely outcome
but definitely a big risk you know
nothing you should ignore
um
see anything else Happening Here uh the
latest data is that catching covid uh
could give you erectile dysfunction
because apparently that covid likes to
Cluster in your junk if you're a guy
now
that just at the time the persuasion
about getting vaccinated started to
Peter out in other words we'd vaccinated
everybody that was probably going to
agree to it by this point or something
close to it and the only people left
were the hard cases the really hard case
you're never going to convince me to get
that vaccination and then suddenly right
on time
just when you need it the most a study
comes out that suggests that getting
covered can make your your penis not
work
that's a little bit too on the nose
isn't it
yeah petered out
that was accidental pun Peter down
with this is that It's too convenient
it's like really you know we we watch
one study after another that turns out
to be BS because they've done something
wrong is this the one that's that they
did right
do you think that there's one perfectly
timed on the nose most persuasive thing
you could ever say
just happened on his own
pure coincidence
it could be like you can't rule out
coincidence unfortunately you can never
rule it out that's you know sort of in
the nature of a coincidence but I don't
know call me skeptical on this one but
okay and also we don't know if the
vaccination would hurt your dick more
than the covid so it's all unknowns
um
that ladies and gentlemen
is the best show that anybody has ever
put on
um I think I've delivered
I I think that I've met my standard of
the best show that's ever been put on
um
How can there be any privacy in the
metaverse oh that's interesting
if you're if your life let's say your
social life moves to the metaverse or
even your financial life even your
professional life I guess could all be
in the metaverse
the metaverse of biased nature
is going to know everything about you
which means you know uh meta the company
will know everything about you if they
choose to
um
Erica says she needs a cigarette after
Today's show it was that good and I
agree Erica I think you're right it it
was that good
and
um
people need to learn more about Dows and
dexes and defy yeah let me give you some
homework
if you would like to be let's say
capable of predicting the future
one of the things you should do a quick
Google search on and just just get the
high level understanding of it is called
a Dao
d-a-o it's in the crypto world with
blockchain Etc it's a way to organize an
organization using tokens to decide who
has what power to do what uh but there's
tons of flexibility things you can do
with it and they're just figuring it out
so it's entirely possible that the
republic democracy everything we know
about corporate governance are all just
about to go out the window
like one of the biggest changes that
Civilization could ever experience
is the Dao d-a-o
now it might not I mean it could be the
the flying car of of blockchain it could
be something we always think is coming
and it never does never makes an impact
possible but there are a lot of people
really really smart who are saying uh
watch this this could just change
everything you would only need a few
successful projects
for it to become the thing
all right
Harmony One blockchain you know I can
only get about this deep into the
blockchain stuff and if I talked about
it it wouldn't wouldn't mean too much to
most of you but I would say that for
your own education you need to at least
get up to speed on what a dow is Dao
distributed autonomous organization
so it's a leaderless organization that
could still work
um
Scott did you see Adam Townsend claim
China wants to cut one third of its
population I don't know anything about
that
you saw me on Dr Drew and it was great
thank you
um
yeah I don't know anything about Adam
Townsend's prediction about that
I don't know what that would be about
how do you increase your blood oxygen
uh see your doctor you might have asthma
I feel like I just cured somebody
there are probably people here who have
measured their measured their oxygen
levels and it's a little low they don't
know why
uh you might have asthma
you know you might need to get on an
asthma but
all right
um I'm gonna
do briefing exercises what's that oh
breathing exercise you need yeah look
into the Wim Hof breathing exercises
uh Hoff is spelled h-o-f and his first
name is just Wim w-i-m
uh
Blake Jameson do I want to chat about
what
all right um
talking about boom
oh here's a funny a funny idea
from the laser guy I always talk about
aggressive compliance breaking a system
by complying to it to two specifically
and and the suggestion is uh time for
aggressive compliance if everyone
quarantines for five days the government
has to end the pandemic
he's right if we all just said hey I
feel like I don't know I got a little
body ache I don't have a test
I guess I better stay home for five days
if everybody just decided to stay home
for five days the whole country would
shut down it would take about 24 hours
for the pandemic to be over now I don't
think we could ever organize such a
thing and I think it's going to happen
on its own yeah I think we're where we
want to be
Scott who trained you in hypnotism I
went through a small hypnosis School in
San Francisco that no longer exists
a school means one hypnotist was
teaching a course basically
uh the flattened curve
um
I I don't talk about the flat in the
curve not working because to me the
whole story there is it was worth a try
and it didn't work
if if that has any lingering
impact on your understanding of what
we're doing now it shouldn't
because that we did exactly the right
thing which was we tried something in in
the context of not knowing what would
work and what what when we tried
something that we could reverse if it
didn't work
it didn't work
so we stopped doing it
I I don't consider that a mistake
I consider that a good decision that
didn't work out that's very different
all right
uh vax cards on February 1 I don't know
I doubt it
many knew that flooding the curve was a
bad idea no they didn't no they didn't
that there's nobody who's more annoying
than the person who guesses right and
then says they knew it all along
no nobody knew that flattening the curve
wouldn't work
you probably you know a lot of people
thought it wouldn't or had an opinion
but nobody knew that's why you test it
that's exactly why you test it it
couldn't be knowable
all right yeah you guessed right so good
for you you guessed right
um if I were a dictator what government
agencies would you ask all of them
because I'm a dictator they just have to
do what I tell them to do
Scott wait wait there's a picture of you
online with your shirt off is it real
well there's more than one picture of me
with my shirt off on the internet and
the only ones I know of are real
I don't know if there's any fake ones
now um to defend myself if I may
if you're over 60 you really shouldn't
take your shirt off on the internet
like it's not it's not really anything
anybody wants to look at
even if you're in good shape nobody
really wants to look at that uh
what's your certain age if we're being
honest you you could be the best looking
65 year old ever
nobody wants to really look at that
if I'm being honest right but if you
write a book about how to develop
systems for fitness and diet
I feel like you're obligated to take
your shirt off on the internet
because if you're saying I use these
systems and you should use them too you
got to show your work right now Geraldo
was not promoting a system for Being Fit
so that was you know just Geraldo big
Geraldo which by the way I love Heraldo
I love that guy I don't agree with him
on all of his opinions nobody does but I
just love that guy the the fact that he
took his shirt off at 70 whatever and
said hey he's still looking pretty good
he was right right
for his age he looked amazing
and I I give him full credit for that
now not everybody would take their shirt
off in that situation but that's why I
like him I like him because he did that
he has no sense of embarrassment it's
like a superpower
would you rather be you
whatever you is or would you rather have
the balls to take your shirt off in your
70s and tell people ah this looks pretty
good doesn't it
that takes a lot of balls
if there's one thing that you can't uh
complain about Geraldo
you can't complain about it be afraid of
 it doesn't seem to be afraid of
anything
and that's one of his best features so
you don't want to lose that the fact
that he took his shirt off in his 70s
I'll always like him more for that
to me that was all positive
but at the same time I can say nobody
wants to see an old man with her shirt
off even if they look good
for their age
so the the two uh shirtless selfies of
me are two different looks
I did one in my late 50s in which I was
trying to see how lean I could get see
if I could get a six-pack so that was
sort of the the six-pack picture
but I got a lot of comments from people
who said it was too thin and that you
know as a man it was not it was not a
look that people wanted to look at it
was a little too thin and so I took that
advice and tried to you know add a
little bulk to things
so the the second more recent picture is
the the little bulkier picture in which
the ABS are de-emphasized and the
shoulders and arms are emphasized
anyway that's all for today and I'm
going to go do something else uh thank
you for being here for
the best
damn live stream of all times of all
time
thanks for being here
