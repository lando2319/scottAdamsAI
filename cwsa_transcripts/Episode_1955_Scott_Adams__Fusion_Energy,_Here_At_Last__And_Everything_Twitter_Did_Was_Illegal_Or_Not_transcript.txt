dot DotA
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilizations Today's
show will be extra special
because yesterday I did something that
was unprecedented
I'm not sure but I think I slept
almost seven hours last night
the last time I did that
I might have been in my 20s
I think I don't think I've done it since
my 20s and I gotta I feel completely
different
I mean I feel like an old different
person
weird I know but let's uh take that
energy up a little bit I'll I'll share
it with all of you in case in case
anybody's a little low energy today
I got something for you I get extra
and the white board behind me yes we
will be going into full whiteboard
supremacist mode no it's not as bad as
you think it's poorly branded I get that
I get that I didn't put a lot of work
into The Branding maybe I could work on
that later but for now it's whiteboard
Supremacy well yeah that's really a bad
name
all right we're going to work on that
but while we're doing it if you'd like
to take your experience up a notch
all you need is a copper among your
glass of tanker cells inside the canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
the thing makes everything better you
wouldn't even need a white board for
this day it's called the simultaneous
sip it happens now go
ah
I'm being told in the comments
that there's now a Scott Adams fans
Discord site did I read that right
or is it about coffee with Scott Adams
anyway the the link is uh over on the
locals site
if anybody wants to put that link link
on the
uh YouTube site for them that would be
great some of you are in both
uh is that where all the nudes are
uploaded yes you can see all of my nudes
um apparently we we hear that I heard
this yesterday I didn't realize that
that uh Hunter Biden had maybe 25
000 pictures
of genitalia
mostly his own
he seemed very
very proud of his own junk
and that's no crime
because he's probably he's probably not
the only person who ever stood in the
mirror and took a picture
even twenty five thousand
I might know somebody who took 25 000
pictures of themselves
that would be everybody on Instagram
anyway we'll talk about that
um
let's talk about it now so yesterday I
was alerted to a kim.com
spaces event where people can do voice
conversation on Twitter
and they had with them a an individual
Garrett somebody whose last name I
didn't catch
who was apparently uh is it Garrett
Ziegler
I'm just looking at the comments and Say
Goodbye
but
um
I don't have any way to validate or put
a credibility ranking on what I heard
um so I don't have a good sense of how
credible any of this was
but
I'll tell you that if you didn't hear
the other side of it and that's always
the problem right if you're one side of
anything
you should discount it a little bit you
gotta hear the other side and we haven't
really heard any kind of a defense
from the the hunter Biden team I mean
other than they claimed falsely it was
Russian disinformation but beyond that I
haven't seen anything other than hey
there's no evidence
I think that's the the defenses no
there's nothing there nothing to see
um
so that's about it but let me give you
my impression of it
if if most of what I heard on that
spaces was right
the government is a deep criminal
organization and the Biden family have
been criminals for decades like serious
criminals like really serious criminals
uh now that's that's the claim
and uh the evidence for that is the
laptop itself
so nothing I don't believe anything was
added to the conversation but the exact
stuff on the laptop
so what this individual did Garrett was
he let's say he indexed the laptop I
think that's the best way to say it so
if you wanted to see any topic they've
got an index that will point to all the
various places within you know a zillion
documents they would see some reference
to it so now that it's indexed
and it's also public so the the entire
laptop contents with no editing are
available through some site that he had
published so you can now go look at
every base Source yourself
and you can also see it in the most
organized way because it's now indexed
so you can go right to the parts that
matter even if they're in different
places
yeah so somebody needs to probably post
the uh
uh in the comments where the links are I
don't have that myself I would do it
myself but I don't have them now here's
here's my caution
I don't know how much credibility to put
in that
I don't
I mean these are people I'm not familiar
with at least in terms of their
credibility so I don't know
I don't know but it's really interesting
because the the evidence seems fairly
solid
but that's always the case when you only
hear one side
do you remember my story about watching
the two competing documentaries and the
question of whether uh Michael Jackson
had uh sexually abused underage kids
so I watched the first one and it made
the claim that there's tons of evidence
and Witnesses and you know
whistleblowers
no pun intended uh who are saying yes
definitely happened no doubt about it so
I watched that documentary and man it
was convincing totally convincing when I
was done with that I was like whoa that
blew my mind he's so guilty
so then another documentary came out
to debunk the first one
so I said to myself well there's no way
they're going to pull that off
because I just watched something that's
so convincing
what could you possibly say about it
and then I watched it it was 100
convincing
that Michael Jackson was innocent and
was framed
100 percent
now which of those two positions do I
take I've seen two documentaries and
they were both 100 convincing like
really really convincing
and the only conclusion I can take is I
don't know
innocent until proven guilty
you know it's not very comfortable
because if he is guilty it's pretty
horrible
but I don't see it unfortunately what is
presented to the the public
is too completely convincing arguments
that are opposites
so I don't know
so when you watch when you see this
presentation if you follow up in the
kim.com spaces thing and Garrett's take
it's all very useful
because he's indexing a real thing and
he's showing his work it's all
transparent very useful but you haven't
heard the other side
you just haven't heard the other side
but things that we know are reported
are that the baidus did do the so-called
Mafia talk
you know the mafia talk where you don't
say the crime directly but it's pretty
obvious as in 10 for the big guy
that sort of thing and uh Joe Biden's
brother saying that what they were
involved with with was
um
what's the word deniability
feasible deniability what's that phrase
feasible deniability plausible
deniability
they actually used the phrase
Biden's brother actually said they're
engaged in plausible deniability that's
like as close as you can get to a mafia
talk confession of a crime but it isn't
it isn't that's just somebody talking
and you know it's here to say by the
time you get it
so I don't know it's true
but I'll tell you my bias
is just screaming
that they're a criminal organization
just screaming it
but but I'm trying to use that little
tiny remaining critical part of my brain
whatever's left of it to say it's not
proven you haven't seen the other side
wait until you see the other side
remember the Michael Jackson thing you
got fooled by that remember you fell for
the Covington kids hoax until you saw
the other video that totally debunked it
so unfortunately we are a species
that can be fooled very easily
by circumstantial evidence
so yeah even even with the Tony
bobolinski
um
information even with the laptop you
still
it's hard it's hard but you still have
to hear the other side you just have to
there's there's no there's just no way
around that because there's so many
cases when you thought there couldn't be
another side there just couldn't be
another side and then there was
and then there was you've all had the
experience right you've all had the
experience of being convinced there
could not be another side to the story
and then there was
if you had never had that experience
it would be a very different situation
but we all have we've all had the same
experience
well I feel like I'm the only person in
the whole world
who's defending innocent until proven
guilty
I mean
and I'm doing it under under the cloud
of being really really certain that they
look guilty
but still
but still
so
that's that's sort of my theme for the
day is innocent tool proven guilty
um
yesterday some folks on the locals
subscription service
suggested that I suggest to Elon Musk
using my big old Twitter account
that uh
Twitter should host debates
and maybe they should be
um crowd-funded debates where any any
Twitter user could say hey I'd like to
see these two people debate and they
start a crowdfund and then if those two
people both accept the debate you share
the money so Twitter would make its you
know let's say 30 or whatever
and the two the maybe the host plus
anybody involved would get some share
and then it's just the free market
then the free market just creates
whatever you wanted to create
and so somebody say Scott you know me
and Keith olberman
I would do that debate
if enough money was involved
sure
I mean I would do it for fun
but I would also do it
because I like money you know if if I
could spend an hour doing something I
wanted to do anyway and get money for it
of course I would
of course I would
he
I don't know maybe
um
so I guess the bigger point about that
is not whether that debate thing will
ever happen
the bigger point is the mechanism
so this small group of people on the
locals platform
can communicate to me
and then since I'm a high visibility
kind of person I can get to whoever they
need me to get to with at least the
suggestion
now did Elon Musk see the suggestion I
don't know but he's very active and
seems to read a lot of stuff that
references it maybe I mean I would think
he looks at the bigger accounts in what
they say
so that that might have worked and we'll
see if anything comes of it
um
you want to hear the best news ever
that's a big claim isn't it the best
news
ever
that's my claim my claim is that there
will never be news maybe in the history
of the world
they'll ever be as good as this
following news
Fusion looks economical
we don't know
so don't get don't get too excited
there's some uncertainty here
but my neighbors down the road
literally e-bike distance from where I
live just down that way
now actually
down that way
yeah down that way
um
they figured out they did an experiment
with nuclear fusion and it created more
energy than it took to create the to
create the effect
it actually was not positive now they
have not they have not announced it this
is based on insiders talking to the some
some sources
uh there are also indications in the
same articles
that Lawrence Livermore is not
confirming it yet so it's not confirmed
but the Insiders are confirming it
now I don't know if the Insiders are
right maybe we'll be disappointed like
the last oh have we ever been
disappointed by a optimistic Fusion
Energy story
has that ever happened oh
4 000 times
it's like the most the most repeatable
fake news of all fake news hey they got
that Fusion to work Tuesday oh no
Wednesday no was it Thursday hey they
got that Fusion to work
oh no it turns out not so much it's
basically Charlie Brown kicking the
football
however
everything that worked
started as something that didn't work
and sometimes for a long time
are you following Quantum computing
how long have they been talking about
Quantum computing
but it's actually now being used for
actual applications
how about flying cars talking about it
forever right
but you can now you can buy one you know
there there are designs that totally
work you know they're sort of like the
the hobby drones with the four
the four little helicopter things on
that are kind of protected and the only
thing that they needed was to have
better batteries
and better Computing so that the
computer can keep it stable and we have
those things
now it may not be economically
um
economically viable yet
but you can actually invest in a real
thing that could actually be built and
if they built it it would actually fly
and it would do exactly what they say so
that's all real now
so
so on one hand
you have to be really skeptical about a
claim that's been wrong four thousand
times in a row
we all get that right
still
you cannot turn off my optimism because
I've had over seven hours of sleep last
night there's nothing you can do to me
I'm invulnerable yeah you can try your
negativity on me but it's just going to
bounce right off it's like it's not even
there
yeah I'm invulnerable today
that's what a good night of sleep will
do for you
so I'm I'm going to say that my
neighbors down the road
have uh pulled it off and we might find
out that later and if I'm wrong it will
be the four thousand and one time I was
wrong about this time is real
so hold your breath hold your breath on
that
well I got a little pushback on my claim
that Fusion might finally be here
because I said stop making fun of
California and my neighbors just saved
the World by cracking Fusion
but uh Twitter account called Christy
land
and Christy said that's California's
tragic flaw
oh
she said brilliant people thank you but
they espouse luxury beliefs that
increase their own social status
but also harm the lowest class thank you
rob Henderson for putting into words
something I've been bothered about since
the 90s
so the claim is that Californians might
do some good things such as saving the
entire world
maybe with Fusion
uh but they also have a bad habit of
espousing so-called luxury beliefs a
luxury belief
would be sort of a woke
kind of thing you believe because it
doesn't hurt you
but it might hurt other people
might hurt other people
so uh so if you're rich for example you
might say uh let all those immigrants in
because then you look like an awesome
open-minded person
but you're not the one who's going to
suffer you just get free workers or
inexpensive workers other people might
suffer so that would be a luxury belief
you know yeah it's a luxury that I can
say let all of the immigrants in who
want to come let them all in because if
I'm an elite
it's just free gardening you know it's
all good for me luxury belief
so I didn't take that well
and so I don't know if you've heard it
yet but I had seven hours of sleep last
night nothing could affect me no
argument can penetrate my armor and so I
said
do you know the last time I had a
private conversation with a Californian
who embraced wokeness
never
not once not a single time
there is not one person I've ever
spoken to privately when nobody else is
there not one person has been even a
little bit supportive of wokeness not a
single one in my entire life not one
I live in Northern California
I live in the middle of the supposedly
bluest place in the world
never met one never met one
now I do believe
if I if I you know sparked a
conversation at a Starbucks
you know with the Barista I'd get a
different response right so I you know
my filter is people who talk to me
that's a very you know limited filter
I suppose I get an argument there surely
are people who do have that feeling
but the people that I tend to associate
with are what kind of people
who is it do you think that finds their
way to me
high IQ people
I just tweeted before I went live that
above a certain IQ wokeness just doesn't
exist
it doesn't
and the people who tend to you know seek
me out and end up having you know
private conversations tend to be
unusually high IQ people
they're CEOs they're the most you know
successful investors they're they're
literally famous people that you've
heard of they're very smart people
and among the highest IQ people behind
closed doors there is zero support for
any wokeness none I haven't never seen
it
now if I go down the IQ
um
ladder do I find people who are argue
vigorously in favor of wokeness yes I
would yes I would
but I have almost no contact with it
that if you took a uh if you gave my
entire neighborhood an SAT test
he'd be really impressed
in my neighborhood could just
kill an s.a.t test pretty much every
house on this block has somebody who's
probably top two percent
right now that's of course so I live in
a strange neighborhood that's not usual
but that's my claim
my claim is above a certain IQ and there
is no wokeness behind closed doors
now publicly there are plenty of smart
people who speak in woke terms plenty
not behind closed doors
doesn't happen
all right
um
here's a reason to ban Tick Tock if you
didn't already have one
Machiavelli's underbelly account on
Twitter tells us he tried to infect Tick
Tock a little with counterpropaganda in
other words he tried to put something on
Tick Tock there would be a counter to
tick tocks presumed social wokeness
agenda
and it was a a deep fake but not one
that was trying to look like the actual
character so it was a it was a CGI AI
kind of version of trump
saying some things like Trump would say
them but it was not created to make you
think it was real it was too cartoonish
and a tick tock
um Tick Tock did not allow it
on there because they they disallow deep
fakes
so their policy is no deep fakes
so when this content went on there there
was obviously a cartoon it wasn't even
close to trying to look like a real
person
they stopped it under the policy of deep
fakes
now do you imagine that there are any
deep fakes on Tick Tock that are
supportive of their presumed social
preferences that are not banned despite
being
the effects of course there are of
course there are yeah so their
enforcement is quite unambiguously you
know non-even-handed
now if an American company did this
I wouldn't like it would like it at all
because that you know their finger would
be on the scale
we don't like that
but if a chinese company proves to you
that they can change the narrative
and then they do it right in front of
you
this would be an example of them using
their own rules to to accomplish that
that's a that's a weapon of mass
destruction
right the level of influence that Tick
Tock has is already
enough to destroy a country you can
bring down a government with what Tick
Tock already can do
and now I haven't seen them weaponize it
to the point where they would you know
it's obvious they're trying to do that
because I think that would be a little
showing their hand a little bit too much
but they do have already
the power to completely change our
system
and and we still allow that yet there's
no member of Congress who wants to keep
Tick Tock and they won't they won't get
rid of it
do you need any evidence of Biden
um corruption
see there here's a perfect example where
you have to assume corruption because
governments are guilty until proven
innocent it's not the other way around
so if you look at a situation where
everybody in the government seems to be
on the same side of banning tick tock
and yet it doesn't happen because the
Biden administration's slow walking it
because that's what's happening they're
slow walking it
what are you supposed to conclude
there's only one conclusion
is or not well you could I guess
incompetence would be another conclusion
but you have either incompetence or you
have um the bidens are beholden to the
Chinese government in a way that may
have something to do with Hunter's
business dealings maybe
now we don't know
maybe it's something ordinary in the
bureaucratic process
but
without transparency
so we can see if it's the bureaucracy or
is this some kind of a Biden corruption
thing if you don't have that what is the
fair assumption corruption right right
yeah as a good citizen you should assume
publicly and privately that you're
seeing corruption in a overt
non-disguised form
because if they wanted to debunk it
they could just say oh let me explain
why it's delayed and you can check it
yourself it's delayed because let's say
this committee is working on it or
something and you could talk to the
committee find out for yourself and they
will confirm the only reason it's
delayed is they have this process and it
takes a long time something like that
right wouldn't it be easy
super easy for somebody in the Biden
Administration say oh yes yes I
everybody wants this ban but it just
takes longer than you think because you
know that's the way government works
I might even accept that
yeah I mean as an indication of
incompetence over corruption but when
you have no explanation
your default has to be as a good citizen
who's just trying to you know call balls
and Strikes you have to assume that
assume guilt
it's not proven
but it has to be you're at your active
assumption you should vote on that basis
vote on that basis now that's a little
different than the accusations against
Trump right because the accusations have
been about Trump they kind of need to
work in a
uh in a court of law and so far they
haven't
that's really all you know about that
well
what else is going on
quite a bit actually
um
I saw that some Democrats are
canceling their Tesla orders because
they're so angry at Elon Musk because
yesterday he tweeted uh
his pronouns are prosecute and fauci
Elon Musk actually tweeted prosecute and
fauci
now I have a problem with that
I have a problem with that I do love
the transparency
I do love that we see Elon Musk
unfiltered
um it's just so entertaining and
probably useful too because you you do
feel like you're getting the real story
because the because of the lack of
filtering
but when you see the richest person in
the world who also owns Twitter
suggests that an individual American
should be prosecuted
that feels uncomfortable to me does
anybody else have the same feeling you
know it shouldn't be illegal because
he's got freedom of speech but it feels
uncomfortable to me like that's that's
not exactly where I think
his best service to the country lives
but at the same time it's freedom of
speech and it's an honest opinion it's
an important topic you know I can see it
both ways
you can see it both ways I I would just
I guess
um it's dumb to try to give advice to
Elon Musk right because it kind of puts
you in like you're some Superior brain
or something which is sort of an absurd
an absurd assumption
um so I could say that if it were me
I would I would be pulling back on
accusations about individuals
but accusations about entities totally
fair and certainly accusations about
past Twitter employees and that's right
in his that's right in his strike zone
so that's okay too
you say you disagree because he's
speaking for a conservative majority
um
I'm not opposed to his freedom of speech
I'm not opposed to I don't say it should
be illegal I just think as a citizen of
the country
there probably are plenty of people who
are making the case and there are I mean
social media is full of calls for
prosecuting fouchy it's just I don't
like to see somebody with that much
power
use it against an individual citizen
it was bad enough when we saw the Joel
Roth
enough or whatever is
when we saw his college PhD paper which
apparently has been removed
yeah I don't think he gets access
anymore
um that was that was uncomfortable to me
but at least it was right on target with
what everybody cared about and he had
promised us transparency so so I think
that was acceptable
even if uncomfortable right
uncomfortable doesn't mean you need to
ban it right we live in a world that is
routinely uncomfortable in lots of ways
we just have to deal with that
all right the other thing that Elon Musk
said is that the woke mind virus is
either defeated or Nothing Else Matters
and you know Democrats see this sort of
talk
and one of them I I didn't care who it
was said he is going to cancel his uh
Tesla order he said he already did he
just canceled his Tesla order
because of Elon Musk Hayden wognes
now this creates an interesting
situation
very interesting it turns out that in
about two to three years
we will be able to identify Democrats
because they're driving shitty electric
cars
because everybody who was going to get a
Tesla who decided to get a competing
electric car is going to be driving
around in the
shitty electric car
so we're about three years away from you
know conservatives driving down the
street in their new Tesla and looking
over at the the non-testinal electric
car you know the Chevy Volt or whatever
is what is it like Democrat
Democrat
uh Democrat
[Laughter]
the Nissan Leaf all right now let me be
fair
I have no reason to believe that the
rivian
models are anything but good cars I
don't know I mean I don't have any
information one way there I'm just
saying that Tesla has a pretty
commanding
technical reputational
sort of system advantage that's hard to
compete with yeah market share Etc
all right what do you think do you think
the woke mind virus is either defeated
or Nothing Else Matters will the woke
mind virus defeat us will it make us so
um ineffective that the whole country is
doomed and maybe the world
maybe maybe but the counter to that is
the Adam's law of slow-moving disasters
the Adam's law of slow-moving disaster
says if everybody can see the problem
coming
and you've got lots of time to get ready
and it's a big scary problem
we always solve it that's why we still
exist humans would already be extinct if
we couldn't solve that kind of problem
fairly often
fairly often we're pretty good at it
so what would that look like
what would it look like if the woke mind
virus is being defeated or the beginning
of it is happening well it would look
like ESG is dying
so ESG is taking a hit from critics
everywhere looks like Vanguard pulled
out and some other some other entities
are pulling out the the top mines in
business are mocking it you know musk
mocked at Dilbert comic mocked it so
that's just the beginning of what I
think is the pendulum shift
now here's my argument for
the Golden Age
the golden age does not happen
when one side has all the power
it happens when you're moving from one
side to the other and you're sort of in
the middle so the the pendulum I think
went with full wokeness and now it's
starting just starting his pull back and
we hit when we have somewhere in the
middle of the pendulum swing you know
before it goes full conservative point
of view because it won't
somewhere in that middle everybody's
going to be the happiest compared to
either side of the pendulum at either
side of the pendulum you satisfy half of
the people
in the middle
maybe 65 percent the difference between
half of the people being happy and
two-thirds
is really big
that's Golden Age versus a bad a bad day
so we we may be heading towards
something good here's the weirdest story
that will break your head
over in Japan they have a population
bomb problem they have too many old
people not enough young people to fill
important jobs
so they're trying to use immigration
to fill the necessary jobs because they
basically can't survive they don't have
a they don't have a plan to survive as a
country really
unless they bring in young people from
somebody someplace else they just don't
have enough time or social structure to
create enough babies to fix it so it's
either going to be robots or immigration
now Japan has a problem
because immigration doesn't work as
easily there as it does in the United
States the United States is a designed
immigration friendly country You could
argue that but we're more immigration
friendly than let's say Japan
more than China yeah more than a lot of
other places
so we have a design
flaw
which is we don't have a system to keep
out people we want to keep out that's a
flaw
but our design was always meant
to be permissive about letting at least
large numbers of people in
now here's the weird thing America has
the same problem we also have maybe not
as bad but it's a big problem we have a
big old age bomb and not enough young
people in the pipeline there's not
enough babies to replace the people who
are dying
so America has the same solution and
there's no way around it we're going to
need massive input of young people
younger from other places and we hope
that there are people who have high
birth rates
now what are we getting so we're getting
mostly essential Central Americans right
we're getting mostly Central Americans
what do central Americans bring to the
United States
that we most need besides young workers
there's something else they bring that
we need
to they bring Crime a little bit as do
all populations they have crime but yeah
on drugs all populations bring Crime and
drugs so that would be common to any
group so but what else do they bring
yeah some of you got the right answer
is there more is there more Traditional
Values currently in America or in
Central America
it's in Central America the central
Americans are all family religion
let's have lots of babies
family religion hard work stay out of
trouble
now I'm not talking about the criminals
and the drug dealers the the vast bulk
of them are as conservative as you could
possibly get there isn't a woke person
inside in Central America I don't think
like actually none there probably is no
woke person in Central America now in my
opinion we are bringing in people who
are superior
culturally
to the people the average of the people
here Superior culturally meaning that if
we simply adopted their culture so that
won't happen but if we did if we just
say all right we're just going to take
your culture we'll just adopt it we
would all be religious family oriented
hard-working people
and we would kick Japan's ass
competitively
we would kick their ass
now it's much harder I believe I could
be wrong about this but I would imagine
if you're an Indian
worker and that's where Japan is getting
a lot of Indian workers if an Indian
worker goes to work in Japan
probably the language problem is pretty
big
and probably they don't want to stay
there because there's a cultural
difference Etc when a Central American
comes to the United States
quite often they also don't speak the
language
but where I live there's always somebody
around who speaks Spanish
always there's always somebody around
who speaks Spanish and the Spanish
people are quite incentivized to learn
English they try really hard to learn
English so we can we can absorb
essential Americans with nothing but
upside now that's a lie we have extra
crime and extra drugs but is more upside
than downside and it actually can renew
that cultural thing that made America
special
right right now we don't have a source
let me ask it a different way
where did America's traditional culture
come from did it Grow from the dirt in
America like corn
or did it come to us from all the people
who came here who brought their culture
with them
they brought their culture with them
there's no such thing as an American
culture there's a culture that ended up
American but it didn't grow out of the
Corn that was coming out of the ground
it came with the people
and we're doing the same thing now but I
don't think you're appreciating how
positive this is the central Americans
are bringing you more more positive
culture
than we've seen since you know maybe in
the 40s or 50s or something
about the planet destroying asteroids I
don't know about that
somebody's asking about planet
destroying asteroids that's sort of a
different topic
all right I'll look into that
um
so there's a I guess there's some
legislation Brewing that would give
amnesty to some some number of the
illegal
uh what should I say undocumented let's
be a little bit woke I like a little bit
of wokeness by the way more than you do
I like a little bit I do like calling
the the people who've come in here
without the benefit of a legal umbrella
I do prefer calling them undocumented
I do I I get that it's illegal
yeah I get that I mean I get the
argument on the other side it's just a
human thing and I think it's a human
thing because I spend more time around
that population than a lot of you so to
me it's such a positive population of
people
that I just reflexively want to use
whatever is the most polite term because
I respect them
it's not because they told me I had to
no no Central American has ever said
Scott stop calling us illegal calling us
undocumented not once I don't think they
ever talk like that I'm just saying that
I show some respect to people who want
to be American so badly that they'll
break the law to be one
like I I can't dislike that there's
nothing in me that can dislike that
yeah and then I'll admit that in
Southern California and if you're closer
to the you know the crime and danger
areas you'd have a different opinion and
I will allow that
so I'm telling you that my opinion is
based on bias
I'm not defending it on logical terms
all right uh Rasmussen did a poll see
what people think about the idea of
giving amnesty to some people
and uh
you know I hate to stroke your egos this
much but it's just can't be avoided
I do have the smartest live stream
audience in the world and and no matter
how many times I demonstrate how
brilliant they are how psychic
ah it's always impressive
so I I give you another public
demonstration uh what percentage of the
U.S voting public believes amnesty would
make the problem better would improve
the situation what
what
oh how are you doing this again
how are you doing this
you're right
it's 23 percent it's within the margin
of error of one quarter how how do you
do this
every time I ask you a poll question you
nail it
I'm starting to think we don't need
Rasmussen and you know Gallup polls and
I mean they're just telling us why you
already know they could just ask you you
don't even need to do a poll do you how
about that
ah what else is going on
um
Ivermectin is making a big comeback on
Twitter
because Twitter apparently is no longer
blocking Ivermectin stories so
Ivermectin Trends almost every day on
Twitter and I think a lot of it is
people need to get it out of their
system
if you tell somebody they can't talk
about Africa on Twitter for two years
and then suddenly they think they can
they just want to talk about it so I
think a lot of it is is the pent-up you
know conversation that they just need to
get out
but
um
let me piss off everybody that's going
to be my theme for the day I'll disagree
with everybody today both sides the
Ivermectin conversation on Twitter
goes like this
my anecdotal information beats your
flawed studies
no it doesn't my flawed studies be your
anecdotal information
and that's the whole argument
nothing else
now
seriously people can you advise me
how can I take sides
can I take sides with that which side am
I going to be on am I going to be on the
my anecdotal information beat your
flawed study side
is that does that sound good or do I
want to be on the my flawed studies be
your addict outside
which of those is the Smart side
yeah let me give you another this is a
callback
if I have a private conversation with
somebody in California
somebody really smart
what did they say about Ivermectin
if I talk to the smartest people I know
what do they say behind closed doors
about Ivermectin yes
they say there's no way to know
they say there's no way to know
because there's only one smart opinion
on ivermected they that that the
information has been so denied to us or
delivered in such a non-credible form
you don't know anything
you don't know anything and above a
certain IQ that is the universal opinion
that you can't tell now there would be
people who have
um a best guess
so there could be very smart people who
say I don't know but I'm leaning toward
X and certainly every one of them would
say it should have been legal to try
every one of them would have said well
it should have been legal for the
doctors to prescribe it like that should
have been okay they'll all say that no
exceptions
all right uh what about all that uh
highly highly credible information that
the reason that Africa did so well
relatively speaking with covet is
because the Africans take Ivermectin
is that is that a good argument
Africans take Ivermectin and therefore
that's the reason
um that's the reason they did so well
with covet everybody convinced
have you ever heard the numbers of how
many take Ivermectin
compared to how many people live there
what percentage do you imagine
of all Africans take Ivermectin what
percentage
just guess
just guess
correct
you're correct okay I'm joking that's
based on a uh there's an account on
Instagram where there's a young man who
goes on the street and asks people like
common common knowledge questions like
really easy ones like where is what
country is the Panama Canal in yes those
kinds of questions and then no matter
what the person says he goes right
so he'll say what country is the Panama
Canal in and somebody will say
I really don't know I think he'll say
just guess he goes okay Japan
and then he'll say right and he just
walks away
he just walks away
right
all right
here's the answer there are 1.3 billion
people in the content of Africa
the number who are treated annually with
Ivermectin is about 112 million
so less than 10 percent
so somewhere around eight eight point
something percent
so do you think that if eight point some
percent of Africans took Ivermectin that
gives us our answer for why Africa did
so well
yes or no
eight percent took Ivermectin and that's
why they did so well
no clearly not clearly not
all right now let me you up a
little bit more
oh stop beating me to it
damn you Sean Michael
who said next to hydroxychloroquine
I didn't study that but surely there are
some hydroxychloroquine users in in
Africa right
and then somebody says the dose is too
low right the dose is too low or given
too late that's why we can say the
studies are all flawed because the dose
is too low or it's not in combination or
they did something wrong uh so you can
always say the studies are flawed
but all of the the country comparisons
are ridiculous they're all ridiculous
now
I would like to spray in my arm by
patting myself on the back in front of
all of you
because that's what
we narcissists do
[Music]
nobody else told you at the beginning of
the pandemic that you would never be
able to compare country outcomes with
each other and know why they were
different
who else told you that
nobody
I'm the only person in the world who
said that when we got to where we are
now you would not know which countries
did the best job of managing it
how many thought that was crazy
right how many thought I was just
totally crazy
but it's true now I know some of you are
saying pascot what about Sweden don't
get me started everything about Sweden
is different from every place else like
like Sweden is uh I think younger
skinnier and have more natural social
distancing than anybody plus they're
voluntary they're voluntary social
distancing wasn't that far away from
other people's mandatory voluntary or
mandatory distancing so everything you
think about Sweden if you dig in a
little bit deeper you find out you know
that none of your assumptions hold they
just don't hold
now the other thing that Sweden does is
they almost also supplement with vitamin
D did you know that how many of you knew
that Sweden is a sort of a national
habit because they don't have enough
sunlight it's normal for the swedes to
supplement with vitamin D
did that did that matter to the outcome
I don't know could have could have we we
keep getting more and more studies
saying that uh
does it mattered all right
um Jay uh batakaria
badakaria I think I'm saying that right
um he's getting a lot of attention
lately because among other things he was
a one of the authors of the Great
Barrington declaration now correct me if
I'm wrong that basically said
uh it was more about letting the virus
give us natural immunity and less about
being aggressive with vaccines was that
the essence of it
am I I'm characterizing that correctly
right
and the official word was no vaccines
are the way to go so Jay was invited in
by Elon Musk to Twitter
headquarters to actually learn about his
own shadow bending which is fascinating
to me so he was fast he was indeed
Shadow band all right so that's a
confirmed fact
um
and uh he was blacklisted for a quote uh
unspecified complaints
and he says each time the reasoning
parenthetically never conveyed to us so
I guess he found through either
documents or conversations with people
that there were there were internal
conversations and those conversations
was that we were not oh this is a
conversation about whether they should
have a blue check
and within Twitter the reasoning was
that they were not notable enough
does that sound real to you
is Jay badakaria not notable enough to
be a blue check
it's a pretty subjective standard isn't
it
you know I would does anybody remember
how long I was on Twitter without being
verified
I was on Twitter for a long time without
being verified do you know on Instagram
I'm still not verified
I've been on Instagram for years
I've always been famous cartoonist guys
Scott Adams I'm not verified
not verified
so
there's certainly a lot of uh
yeah I think it was about seven years
now to be verified I think was maybe two
or three years
but I don't recall if I ever applied for
it so I may not have applied for it so
that may be part of it
um
but it is a subjective standard I do
think that uh
that Twitter was probably putting their
finger on the scales here because I
imagine that they thought the Great
Barrington Declaration was dangerous
and I believe that they acted on what
they thought was safe
we want to get rid of this dangerous
information in favor of safe information
which is kind of their job
so it's another gray area where it looks
sketchy as hell
so if you say to me Scott Scott you
can't excuse that that's sketchy as hell
to which I say I'm not excusing it looks
sketchy as hell
but I don't know if it's a law is broken
which is a separate conversation
all right
um and then people on Twitter are
calling uh musk space Karen
for being uh for being too sensitive to
criticism because they say you blocked
Kathy Griffin uh right after he tweeted
something bad about him
and there was some other notable person
I forget who was blocked right after
tweeting something negative about musk
and so the critics are saying oh he's
space Karen he's too sensitive
yeah
you know
um I don't think it's optimal
that somebody gets kicked off of Twitter
if their last tweet was an insult to the
CEO of Twitter or the owner of Twitter
I feel like that's sub-optimal
but
again
was it illegal
we learned that fauci's daughter has
been working on Twitter for years in
engineering
now I don't think there's necessarily
anything to that fact that's important
except indirectly
imagine if you will that you're a
Twitter employee and you know fauci's
daughter is one of your co-workers
would you want information on Twitter
that made your co-workers father look
like a chimp
well you might say to yourself yeah
that's that's our job it's we're not
we're not managing people's opinions
so you know it's there well I would
think that there would be like a subtle
peer pressure
to not throw your co-worker under the
bus
I don't know if it made any difference
at all but it's an interesting side
thing
no matter what uh fauci's daughter is
not implicated in anything any
wrongdoing so leave her alone
um
all right let's see
uh so Twitter has this whistleblower
who is making a lot of claims and I was
sort of
semi-unaware of this whistleblower but I
saw a long tweet thread today
um and one of the things claimed by The
Whistleblower that in my opinion makes
everything else they claim
um not credible
and here's a claim by The Whistleblower
now there's a bunch of other claims
about
poor engineering of the network and and
major vulnerabilities might be true it
might not be but I don't believe
anything this person says because they
started with this
this person claims this whistleblower
that it was not uncommon and this is a
key phrase keep in your mind not
uncommon so it wasn't common
but it happened enough that it was let's
say ordinary
and here's what he says was ordinary
that employees would install on their
own computers intentionally spyware that
allowed outside entities to control
their computer within Twitter
and that it was not uncommon to do it so
it wasn't one person
it was something that people were doing
now I read that as Twitter was giving
Outsiders control of Twitter
how do you read it
because that couldn't have happened yeah
that really that's that's what I tweeted
was really
really is not uncommon for people to
open up the security of Twitter not only
on their personal laptop which you know
the work and personally were probably
kind of mixed but also
they would just like walk away and let
these Outsiders just manage not only
their careers because the outsiders
would be managing their careers they
would have full control of the person's
career they can do anything to them
right and the people were doing that
like commonly
now
the only way that would make sense
is if there were so many foreign spies
within Twitter that there were more you
know there was like one-third spies or
something
uh impossible
I I suppose anything's possible but do
any of you see that as credible
does anybody believe
that they put spyware on their own
computers
somebody does
all right here's how it might be true
it could be that the word spyware is
being used
um
to let's say flexibly
here's what I think
I think they were telecommuting
and the telecommuting software is
spyware
because if somebody else had it they
could get into your computer
right so it's only who's using that
who's using the software if the
employees were using it themselves
well then maybe you have a security
issue that's possible because remote
work gives you more security problems
but if they had let's say uh airtight
security
let's say they had one of those you know
two-factor authentications let's say
they had two-factor authentication or
something better you know one of those
little counters that you know the super
secure places use so if they were using
something that was sufficiently secure
this is just somebody calling it spyware
but it was probably just telecommuters
who wanted access to their system
they wanted their own files plus you
know Twitter files so they go in through
their own computer and they get both
that's what I think now could they have
handed over the control of that to
malign forces of course but it's not an
Evidence
that is not an Evidence so given the uh
the grotesqueness of the way it was
communicated that there's some kind of
remote software thing I don't believe
anything else
that comes out of this whistleblower
Fair
is that fair
doesn't mean he's wrong
doesn't mean he's wrong I'm just saying
that there's no credibility here that I
can
I can get my fingers on
all right
[Applause]
um
hmm what else is happening well
that was uh
close to everything I wanted to talk
about except the Whiteboard
are you ready for the Whiteboard
this may be more excitement than some of
you can take and so this would be a good
time
for you to you know close your ears and
eyes this could hurt it could hurt
here's how the world works
step one
the Democratic National Committee
creates a narrative which is a spin on
the news hey tell the news this way
they go to their lackeys in the major
media and they say hey
let's Harden this narrative let's let's
make sure everybody hears our narrative
it said the news hardens the narrative
Twitter employees
do they create the narrative
not at all no they are suffering from
narrative poisoning which comes from the
hardening of the narrative that comes
from the DNC
we observe the Twitter staff believing
the narrative
and then acting as though they're saving
the world by suppressing conservatives
and this is how
Jack Dorsey can tell you the truth
and it's also a lie
and there's no conflict between those
two things here's how the truth and the
LIE are the same thing
because the result of this system is
that there was de facto Shadow bending
de facto being the fancy word for saying
well in effect
no matter what anybody intended there
was Shadow Banning like any reasonable
person would look at this system and if
you look at the whole system they say
well the the net obvious effect is that
conservatives were suppressed
and that is Shadow betting
everybody on the same page so far
if the net effective
outcome
is suppression of the conservatives
that's exactly what we see and a
reasonable person would call that shadow
bending wouldn't they wouldn't they a
totally reasonable person would say well
that is Shadow baby
so that's how it's true
the shadow betting was happening
and most of you will be on this here's
how it's not true
it was de facto
it wasn't the intention it wasn't the
policy it wasn't a written policy and it
was not an informal policy
there's no document that suggests they
even talked about it in a political
sense it's clear that they had
preferences
that's unambiguous it's clear that they
thought
conservatives were insurrectionists
crazy dangerous people
so what they acted on was their
own narrative poisoning
they acted on what they believed
was good for the country
but they weren't Shadow Banning what
they thought they were doing is getting
rid of bad people
and they thought that the bad people
well yes it's true that they seem to be
mostly in one party but how's that our
fault
right
yes we observe that all the bad people
according to them are all conservatives
but would they think that's their fault
it's not the facts
esposa Nazis were active on Twitter
I suppose they are but I suppose Nazis
are active on Twitter and Twitter
decides to suppress all the Nazis and
none of the people who are criticized in
the Nazis none of them all the people
criticizing the Nazis are untouched but
all the Nazis are suppressed
is that evil
is that evil
is it
is that evil
no no that would be people doing exactly
what you wanted them to do because
they're citizens of the country and they
have your well-being in mind they're
protecting you from the Nazi
um effect and they're doing it for all
the right reasons
now
because of narrative poisoning
who did the Democrats think were the
Nazis
the conservatives so they were just
acting on their illusions
acting on your illusion is not good
but it's not necessarily illegal
so my argument that nothing illegal has
happened and probably even Jack Dorsey
did not lie to Congress
he probably said we don't have any
policy like that we simply act on things
that come to our attention no matter
where they come from
now I I pasted
um
on Twitter I pasted my worst Twitter
related arguments
I'll just hit him really quickly you've
heard him before but I just want you to
see them in context I hear the worst
arguments and these are the worst
Arguments for people who agree with me
so these are people I like with the
worst arguments so I'm not I'm not
biased against the speakers
because I agree with them sort of in
principle it's just their argument is so
weak that it's embarrassing me I don't
want to be on the same team with a bad
argument here's the first one uh Twitter
colluded with the FBI to ban Earth or
throttle things we know that they met
we know that the FBI gave them uh wrong
information and we know that they acted
on it is that a crime
no
anybody could bring Twitter information
and then Twitter would act on it if they
had acted on all of the things that the
FBI brought to them well that's
different isn't it that's the case with
the FBI being in control but they only
accepted half of what the FBI said
were factual problems or whatever only
half
so that indicates that they did not feel
coerced also all of their conversations
about either the Democrats
or the FBI
was that they were all in the same team
what's it mean to be coerced by people
who agree with you
there's no coercion there there's just
two people agree and they're in the same
room
so
now you're I'll get to your other
arguments because I know you have more
um what about the idea that Twitter
should be a common carrier and not
censoring anything
it's a good argument it's just that's a
different argument than the did they
break the law
the question of whether in the future
they should be regulated is a good good
conversation
the question of whether they broke the
law already is unrelated to that that's
just a different conversation that
argument
uh did Jack Dorsey lie to Congress that
the shadow ban for political reasons I
don't think so
there's no evidence that it was a policy
and there's no evidence that they even
talked about it like an informal policy
it might be true
but we have no evidence of that
right and there would be evidence there
would be by now I think
all right um
uh there might not be any direct
evidence of Twitter policy of Shadow
Banning but what about all their Mafia
talk
what about all the mafia talk where the
if you look at the full context and who
they banned and how they talked about it
and clearly they had some attitude about
Trump in particular and maybe bongito
too you know if you think if you put
that all together it's kind of like
Mafia talk where they all understand
what they're doing but they don't have
to say it out loud Maybe
let me tell you what actual Mafia talk
sounds like
10 for the big guy
that's actual Mafia talk
how about Joe Biden's brother telling
bobolinski we're operating under
plausible denial
meaning keeping Joe Biden out of the bad
business that's Mafia talk that's what
it looks like right
Mafia talk is not so subtle that you
can't tell it's happening
and that the the the the the
criticism of trump is that he was always
using this Mafia talk now I think it
would be harder to defend Trump because
Trump's pretty you know he's a he's a
clever persuasive player and maybe
you know maybe he's got a little extra
that he's intending there
all right
um
do you think
uh
some people said Scott Scott it doesn't
matter that the Twitter employees had
good intentions and that they thought
they were simply correcting uh dangerous
information it doesn't matter what they
thought
because why does it not matter
because Hitler thought he was doing the
right thing too and the Nazis thought
they were doing the right thing and Paul
thought he was doing the right thing and
Stalin thought he was doing the right
thing for the greater good and I'm sure
Mal thought he was doing the greatest
greater good so you really can't
you can't give people a break
for uh thinking they were doing the
greater good right
except that
we only have evidence of content
moderation
that's all we have we have evidence of
content moderation of the normal kind
they do when somebody from the outside
says hey this is dangerous and then they
look at it and in the case of the FBI
they only took their recommendations
half of the time
if you only take FBI's recommendations
half of the time are you worried about
them
does that sound like somebody who's
worried
who worried would be 90 of the time
50 says we're in Cut we're in control
that's what that's what it sounds like
to me now but what if there really was
some coercion there it's just not
obvious but what if there was
like they just felt coerced is that a
crime
well how would the FBI inform Twitter of
something that's important and dangerous
without influencing
is there some way to do that
and should the FBI not tell them because
to tell them would be to influence them
you can't make it illegal for somebody
to tell you stuff
you can't make that illegal now maybe in
the case of you know insider trading or
some special case but the FBI have
freedom of speech they can talk to
anybody about anything Twitter has
freedom of speech they can talk to
anybody about anything and if Twitter
were complaining about the pressure I
would take that really seriously
and maybe that will be a defense maybe
they'll say yes we did feel pressure and
I would take that seriously
but it's not an Evidence there's no
evidence at the moment that Twitter was
doing anything except what they wanted
to do and the FBI made it easier
because the FBI was doing the fact
jacking they happened to agree with
their bias
so if you do something that agrees with
your bias and you wanted to do anyway is
that because you were coerced
it's the opposite
it's just somebody helping you do the
thing you wanted to do
so
how about this is Twitter's work on
behalf of the Democrats an in-kind
donation so it would be a violation of
election law a lot of people are telling
me that does that make sense it's an
in-kind donation so even if maybe they
didn't have any intention
the net effect was they were so biased
there was like a gift to the Democrats
and therefore since they did not report
that gift it has a monetary value
that's against election laws right
so why does msnb still still in business
can you explain that how about the New
York Times The Washington Post
how about Breitbart how about Fox News
how about CNN why are they still in
business
um
they are all in-kind donations to a
political party
unambiguously
each of those networks the only one that
doesn't is axios axios is the only
independent Network the rest are just
working for a party
so why why would you pick
why would you pick out Twitter
as being different than CNN or Fox News
are they not all making in-kind
donations you think Fox News is not
helping the Republicans come on
right yeah I don't know if it's
technically illegal but I can guarantee
it won't be prosecuted
unless you prosecuted everybody and
that's not going to happen
so being biased
and being a public communicator
that's not an in-kind donation how about
me
should I be prosecuted
how many people voted for Trump in 2016
because of my activities
thousands
I know because I asked in the Twin poll
in 1500 people said yes that they voted
for Trump because of me is that not an
in-kind donation to the Trump campaign
how is it not
how is that not an in-kind donation I
literally helped a campaign in public
and there was real monetary value to it
how is that different
right yeah it's a terrible argument it's
a terrible argument I get the argument
the argument makes sense there's a logic
to the argument but as soon as you look
at the context you can see that nobody's
ever been prosecuted for that it's just
not a thing
so at the moment
I don't see any legal uh Jeopardy for
Twitter whatsoever
so that's my view
and I'm going to further distress You by
saying this
this is your January 6th
you know how the uh the left all believe
that January 6 was an Insurrection and
you looked at it you said uh Republicans
don't do insurrections and leave their
weapons home
or at least not brandish them
so to you it's obvious that January 6 is
some kind of mass hallucination
affecting the other side right
it's obvious to the Democrats that all
this Twitter stuff is a mass
hallucination that's affecting the the
right
they're the same story
it's the same story it's just the
reverse of it right
the the the the the the
conservatives are pouncing on every
little piece of everything that comes
out of the Twitter files as if some law
has been broken but there are none
it's probably just exactly what it looks
like it's probably just this
the most obvious explanation is the one
that's right in front of you
the biased people act like biased people
all the time
that's it and we know where the bias
comes from there's no question about
that
it's all it's all plain and obvious and
right in front of you there's somebody
spitting up people's bias and then they
acted on their bias that's the whole
story
and the January Sixers
the reason that the left can't see them
as people who are on their side
because they were the the protesters
were on the side of the people who hate
them because they were trying to protect
everybody's Republic they weren't trying
to protect you know their own personal
Republic they were trying to protect
your republic too now you could argue
that Twitter does the same thing they're
not just protecting themselves
they're trying to protect you
all right
so just be aware that the January 6th
thing and the Twitter files are just the
mirror image of each other it would be
hard to have an opinion on one that is
conflicting with the other
now let's talk about uh cognitive
dissonance tells and I'll I'll count
them out as they come by so Patrick l
says wow in caps Scott is flailing
is that a personal attack or is that a
comment about my point
it's a personal attack so that's
cognitive dissonance
that someone who knows that their
argument fell apart how do you know
because if I'd said something that would
be easily debunked you have plenty of
space to say it you would just say oh
you got that fact wrong check the source
it would be easy to argue against me if
you had a reason but if you're arguing
out of cognitive dissonance you'll go
after me
here's Kamikaze Kami says your argument
fell apart Nate less cognitive
dissonance
uh you made a personal attack on Jay
about what
you saw me make a personal attack on Jay
maticaria
I don't think so I think you're
hallucinated that
um how about
uh
John says in all caps Scott Charles
Manson is innocent we have no evidence
and he denies involvement
does that sound like a a good factual
comment or maybe cognitive dissonance a
less cognitive distance
uh January 6 is resulting in felonies
so
cognitive dissonance
um
hmm
J Sixers is still in jail irrelevant or
relevant to the point true but relevant
so Scotty is ignoring FBI involvement
am I ignoring FBI involvement
let me be clear
the FBI looks like they committed a
crime
as far as I can tell because it looks
like they knowingly interfered with the
election as a government entity
by spreading false information so I
think the uh the FBI should be in jail
you all agree with that right
I I think that I think the evidence
against the FBI is
that's that's pretty clear
now again
I'd have to hear their counter argument
I'd have to hear their counter argument
maybe they have a defense I don't know
but to me that looks like
um
a grotesque crime of some sort I mean I
don't know maybe I'm being biased and
there's no crime there either now they
now if the FBI claims that they were
also mistaken it might be hard to prove
but it looks obviously like a crime to
me
Scott you shouldn't silence all cap
commenters
I don't only the bad ones
all right now you want to hear the
weirdest thing that's happening at the
moment
I I'm going to do a call back and I'm
going to look at the biggest context you
can imagine and I'm going to pull
together some things that'll blow your
 mind you ready for this
how long will it be before yay
brings you all
Roth onto his campaign team
you realize that he's forming a campaign
of the canceled right
have you spotted the pattern yet
he's scooping up all the canceled
all the canceled people
and he's making and he and he's also
making a free speech absolutist claim
and the species the free speech
absolutes claim is that he can say ugly
things
and he doesn't want to get canceled for
it
now when when yay says ugly things
they're not like
Like A Nazi says ugly things
there are things which you can interpret
as uh being ugly but if he explained it
to you in the room you say oh okay that
doesn't sound so bad so being being
canceled because somebody else thinks
that you've crossed the line
that's different than actually crossing
the line and getting canceled just
somebody thinks you did
so
yay is going to make a bigger impact
potentially
on our entire
wokeness situation than maybe anybody
he might he might actually break the uh
breaks the model by being so extremely
counter socially acceptable I guess
that I don't know he might actually
expand our thinking to the point where
we say all right screw all this wokeness
let's just ignore it
yeah there could be
it's too early to say
um
but there is a possibility that yay is
the um
we call it the Rosetta Stone that fixes
everything
yay might be the Rosetta Stone because
because he's so damaging our standard
way of thinking that he's just shaking
the box at the very Time the Box needs
to be shaken
so I'm not I'm not saying that we'll all
agree with yay or he'll be president
I'm saying that the way he's shaking the
box and putting everything in question
by the fact that he's he's teaming up
with you know Fuentes like what does
that do to your head
like I still can't wrap my head around
that but if he keeps pushing
this box shaking
um
counter expectations thing it does
actually put your brains in a more
productive place
where it just shakes you out of your
bias a little bit because you've just
got too much to think about you know yay
is just scrambling your brain
intentionally
so I'll just put it out there the yay
might be possibly and it would be
complete stealth situation you wouldn't
see coming he could be the one who fixes
it all
he might be the one who fixes everything
because one of the things that he does
is he forgives everybody
right he just forgives everybody
but then he says what he believes
and he'd like to say that if a
particular group coincidentally seems to
be thwarting him that he can refer to
them as a group
that's all he asks I think it seems like
a pretty small ask but he gave up
everything for the for that point
all right
Saudi Arabia aligning with Russia and
China Saudi is just being smart Saudi is
just the lighting with everybody they
can align with who wants to align back
that's just smart
um
did you see the poll I ran about who is
the most discriminated person in America
anybody see my poll
I'll give you the the updated uh poll
results
so
um you'll probably have it pasted in the
comments before I can find it myself
but I asked this yesterday so and the
categories I gave for who is most
discriminated against
were um black man black male in America
a woman in America
uh lgbtq in America
or a short white man
last I checked it was 83 percent thought
that the most discriminated person in
America would be a short white man
not a black man not even close
83 percent
uh not lgbtq
and not women
does that sound right to you
that there's far more discrimination
against short white men
than any of the target groups
yeah of course because you've been
completely brainwashed for decades that
the groups that have power are the ones
that are suffering
you've been brainwashed for decades so
you know up looks like it's down and yes
looks like no and zero looks like one
so you look at the short white men and
you say well that guy's in charge
no sure like to be him so he won't have
any discrimination
now clearly people of all types can
succeed
I'm not saying that being in any
category makes it impossible to succeed
now do ugly women
all right do ugly women and then do ugly
men
yeah so short is in the you know and
bald or in the category of unattractive
unfortunately since I'm in that category
but
you have to compensate by making
something about you
better than average
all right so here's my uh reframe on
that
if you frame yourself as uh either as
any one of these things if you say I'm
black or I'm male or I'm female or I'm
lgbtq
Etc
you're sort of giving yourself a reason
to fail
and
my observation is every group has people
who succeed
and they do it all the same way
they do something good
that blinds you to whatever you didn't
like about it right so I'm five foot
eight
and I can blind you to that by having
gigantic muscles
and lots of money
right it just sort of blinds you to
whatever you might have been focusing on
otherwise
now
uh what about Prince remember when
Prince was alive I think Prince was like
five six
but you mostly don't think of Prince as
five six you think of him as five eight
uh you think of him as one of the best
musicians of all time
and incredibly sexy you say the women
Bruno Mars yeah
right so there's there's a pretty big uh
history especially you know Tom Cruise
it's a there's a big history of people
of every kind
who made whatever their disadvantage was
disappear
and I I always tell this story but it's
my favorite story where there was a suit
salesman I was buying a suit and we were
chatting as I was trying on my suit and
I made some self-deprecating comment
about being bald
and he said well you can make that
boldness disappear
by being really fit because when you
really fit people see your body and they
just sort of don't see your head like
they don't see it in the same way
and I thought that is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard who's
not going to notice somebody's bald
and then I noticed
that he was bold
for the first time
because he was really ripped
he was really ripped and I noticed that
I walked and I said that guy's
ripped I wouldn't mind looking like that
and later I realized oh yeah he's also
bold
and the the moment I had that that
realization
that you can make any of your flaws
Disappear by misdirection basically a
magic trick don't look at this hand look
at his hand no not this one look at this
one play with them so you just misdirect
so the uh the positive part of this
Joe Rogan that's a good example the
positive part of this is that people all
over the world
are Mr are redirecting people from their
whatever they would call their
shortcomings to whatever they do well
and it works every time
yeah yeah Bezos
how many people call Bezos that bald
that bald guy
no he's not only rich but he's ripped
why did he get ripped probably the same
reason I do it because you want to you
know you want to distract from whatever
whatever people are going to criticize
you for
so that was your uh encouraging thought
for the day
um just an update on my upcoming book on
reframes
I am at 60 000 words
and by Wednesday I've got to be done
so I'll be working real hard this week
but then there's a whole other level of
hardness that comes after that with the
editing and everything else but more
about that I'll probably be testing some
of the chapters with my locals crowd so
I think I'll read you some chapters and
some reframes as part of our micro
lessons you won't get to see that unless
you're a subscriber but the book will be
out next September I believe
uh
okay
all right that's all for now we'll see
you see you later YouTube
and Spotify and Rumble
