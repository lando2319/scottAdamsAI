dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time
I've already been laughing my ass off
talking to the people on the locals
platform but now we'll bring this
goodness to YouTube and Spotify and
everywhere else
um if you'd like to take this experience
up and I guarantee this will be one of
the best live streams you've ever seen
all you need is a cup of Margaret a
glass of tanker cellices done I can't
team yoga flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sep
it happens now go
ah
oh I don't know where to begin
um but let's begin on a update
uh you remember we used to call them
bums and hobos but that was unkind then
they became the homeless and that
sounded a little over specif over
specific and then they became the
unhoused
uh but now they are just the freedom
crappers and now Los Angeles has
apparently 69 000 freedom crappers
who crap once a day
on the sidewalk
and I was wondering if this happens to
San Francisco we have this uh race every
year in San Francisco it's called The
Bay to Breakers where they race from one
side of the city to the other from the
bay to the beach
and I was thinking that might need to
change the name of the Bay to Breakers
because it's going to look you know if
you're watching it it's going to look a
little more like a Irish Irish line
dancing
because there'll be so many turds in the
way between the the bay and the beach
there's going to be a lot of this but oh
so it looked like Irish line dancing and
and I asked my uh
followers on locals if they could give
me some kind of a new name for this race
because Beta Breakers doesn't feel like
I don't know it just doesn't feel
current does it so instead of the beta
breaker is the best suggestion I got was
a turd of hurdles
turd of hurdles
Allah
no it's not a herd of turtles that's
completely different a herd of turtles
would be a slow-moving bunch of group no
this is a turd of hurdles
it's our Journal
all right well enough about that
um you know everybody asked me why don't
you move out of California that hell
hole
and I say well I mean I'm open to it
but where would I go
and one of the top places that people
suggested was Austin
because it's in Texas and Texas is
awesome and Austin is the awesome Place
well one of them one of the awesome
places in Texas but it turns out that
it's a
democrat-led city and has become a
well
kind of a freedom crapper uh hell hole
so turns out Austin is uh
going down the drain
I feel sorry for Tim Ferriss who moved
out of San Francisco to Austin
um I feel like he did not hurdle enough
turds he needs to hurdle a few more and
maybe get to Florida or something I
don't know what people do but Austin
doesn't look good anymore
yes we will get to all the big news
don't worry
don't worry I'll get to all the big news
it's coming
oh it's governed it's a very newsy day
have you noticed
some of it is about me it turns out
um so here's the updated on remote
workers
so it turns out that as long as
employment is good
the employees have more power than when
employment is low
so employees really really really really
like working at home at least part of
the week
so the the reversal of the trend where
it looked like people were going back to
work
reversed again so the employees were
pushing back against the requirement to
come to work and successfully because
they have the power given employment
so it looks like something like half of
Office Buildings are just going to stay
empty
most of the time
but you can't really get rid of them can
you
because it's the same office that half
of the people are in
so if it's half empty but you still need
it it's going to take a while for people
to downsize
but uh yeah there's a big problem so I
don't think people are coming back to
the city the way they used to
yeah I'm going to turn them all into
pickleball courts that's the best idea
ever I turned at least some of them into
public bathrooms but that's just me
um
so that's happening keep an eye on that
so there's a story uh today
and I don't know if I believe this or
not but apparently on GitHub
there was a Target list of conservative
social media people that would be
targeted by the DNC and leftists
and I thought to myself huh well that's
interesting
I think I'll look at that list
just to see
if I'm on it
right I mean that was my first thought
it's like oh shoot there's a list of
being people being targeted
I'm Number Nine
up in the top ten
five of the top ten the people that I I
share it with have either left Twitter
on their own such as president Trump or
have been kicked off at Twitter
I'm right behind Sydney Powell
on the list of targets that's right I am
right behind Sydney Powell on the top 10
list of conservative influencers that
were targeted for Destruction
now I think that it was specifically
about the 2020 election
can you tell me what it was that I said
about the 2020 election that would put
me in the top ten
of people that they need to Target
do you remember a claim of
a claim that I made about election fraud
some specific claims do you remember
Eddie
there weren't any no I was the one who
told you on day one that at least 95 of
all the claims would be
I was the first person in the country
to call on the Kraken
first one
there was nobody in the country who
called before I did as soon as
I heard it I said that's right
there that's that's a whole bunch of
 right there
now
what do you think I'm gonna do
if I find myself targeted by powerful
interests who are trying to take me out
for my opinions about the 2020 election
so I tweeted this today
things we know are corrupt FBI
Department doj Intel organizations
Congress big Pharma FDA experts all
kinds Biden crime family and the entire
media
but on the good side
things we know that are totally clean
all 50 state election systems
good job guys
good job
all 50 election systems complete as a
whistle now I think we can all be proud
of that
given that 100 of every other
organization is corrupt and we've proven
it just this year
so you might say that's highly unlikely
Scott but I say
that's a sign of Excellence
that's a sign of Excellence all 50 run
by different organizations and yet all
50 pristine
pristine
I have no idea why they targeted me
I don't know what's up with that
so ah that happened I don't know if that
list is Real by the way
so the the larger theme for today's uh
uh live stream is that everything's a
hoax
and I was trying to come up with a name
for a political system that's entirely
based on hoaxes
because that's where we are
our political system is now entirely
based on hoaxes that's it
there's not a real thing
happening anywhere it's all hoaxes
so we'll talk about that but
I don't know if this Twitter
list of targeted accounts is real
but somebody put me in the top tab
with some
pretty interesting cast of characters
there
all right um
so we're going to talk about the uh
Patriot front and Rudy Giuliani and
we're going to talk about the
new what's what you call it report
the Durham report
but
before I do that
I should warn you that we need to be
alert
here's the good news that comes with the
bad news the bad news is we found out
that everything was corrupt just
everything
like everybody was corrupt
the good news is you can spot it much
easier now because you can see how it's
done you can spot the towels right if
tomorrow you saw a video that you knew
was a real video
and it showed somebody doing some
Republican saying something terrible
what's the first thing you say to
yourself
whatever that terrible thing is and
whoever said it what's the first thing
you'd say
what do they what did they edit out what
did he what did he or she say just
before that
and what did he or she say right after
that because that's the part they don't
get to show you because that probably
gave you the context which changed the
meaning
so I'm not sure we would have known that
10 years ago
10 years ago I think I would have just
taken the video at face value
but now we know it's it's so common
to create news by clipping off a part of
the video
that I would assume it's a fake video my
first Assumption of any video that's
super super on the nose embarrassing
like it's just too close to somebody's
narrative
first assumption is fake
right I hope you're all with me now
you're you should make that starting
assumption but then look into it it
could be real you know you want to find
out but your starting assumption should
be fake
now
don't we know
given all the hoaxes we've seen that
there is one being ginned up right now
don't you know there's some major hoaxes
that are brewing and maybe we already
saw them we'll talk about them all right
but
be ready because you have to spot the
next one there's going to be another
Russia collusion like hoax not about
Russia necessarily maybe but
it'll be of that size
and it's coming and it's coming for sure
and I want us all to spot it the minute
it gets here
right because we haven't been good at
that before we want to laugh at it when
it arrives like actually just laugh out
loud it's like nice try that's a little
bit too on the nose
So speaking of that uh I think it's a
one day after or two days after Biden
gave his speech in which he said white
supremacy is the big terrorist risk in
the United States I think I think people
on the right are taking him out of
context
he didn't say it's the biggest risk to
the United States
people are saying that's what he said he
didn't say that he said the biggest
terrorist risk no he said the biggest
domestic terrorist risk
what's the second biggest domestic
terrorist risk after white supremacy
what's the second biggest
there's no domestic terrorist risk
there is none
yeah maybe maybe white supremacy is
number one
on a list of totally unimportant
smallish things that aren't likely to
happen very much in the future
it's a hoax
which is not to say that there have not
been
bad things that some alleged white
supremacists did
but
right after that the Patriot front who
everybody on the right believes is a
fake group pretending to be on the right
as I saw today
there was Elijah Schaefer was saying
that he knows basically everybody in the
Republican conservative world like every
group he knows at least somebody or he
knows somebody who knows somebody
everywhere but he says I've never met
anybody who knows anybody in the Patriot
front
anybody
like I I've personally talked to people
in the proud boys
how many how many of you have had or at
least know somebody who knows somebody
in the proud boys
right it's very common if you're
associated with the right you probably
know somebody maybe not personally but
you know I've talked to Gavin McGinnis I
did an interview with him years ago
but the Patriot front
I've had no contact in any way directly
or indirectly with the Patriot front
it's a little unusual because they get a
lot of but listening don't they now I
know that they wear masks and they're
trying to be secretive but they put out
this video
where it alleges to show them
um when the camera is not supposed to be
running but it's obvious that they're
acting and they know the camera is
running
so they do their little uh
white supremacist salute or whatever and
then as they're done
instead of acting like normal people
when they finish something they act like
actors who are acting like they finish
something it was just terrible acting it
was very obvious acting and then one of
them says some Nazi thing
so that's that's the payoff oh we got
him on they didn't know the camera was
running
so we got him on some Nazi stuff
completely fake looking
now I'm willing to believe I could be
wrong about anything
but if I'm wrong about this I'll be
really surprised right this looks
entirely like a hoax it looks like a
long-running hoax because they just drag
these people out whenever whenever they
need to move the narrative a little bit
so I would say that the Patriot front is
part of it but then there was also this
story about Rudy Giuliani
who is a ex-girlfriend who also did PR
work for him and she alleges that he I
know tricked her into sex and
forced her to perform on demand whatever
he wanted and
some icky stuff like that we don't care
about any of that but one of the things
that she's alleging
is that Rudy Giuliani was offering to
sell pardons
that and he was working with Trump and
that they would charge two million
dollars for a pardon and then Giuliani
and Trump would each keep a million and
allegedly he told his girlfriend this
and then now she's telling the public
does that sound true to you
or does that sound like an obvious hoax
we'll we'll do close
a little bit too close do you think that
Rudy Giuliani even if even if he were
doing some kind of scheme like this do
you think he would just like say it
directly to his girlfriend and give
dollar amounts
do you think you'd give dollar amounts
to his girlfriend
I don't think so
I don't think so do you think that Trump
would sell pardons to make a few extra
million dollars when everybody's
watching
do you think so
uh now I'm it wouldn't surprise me if
somewhere in the history of the world
somebody who sold the pardon that
doesn't sound too surprising
but Trump was already a billionaire do
you think he needed
five million more at the risk of that
yeah the gigantic risk is the most
vetted person ever
anyway so there's nothing about this
that looks real so that looks like a
hoax to me
and I'm a little bit uh curious about a
woman who would have uh what must have
been the Hideous sex with Rudy Giuliani
because she was younger and attractive I
don't know how young but they were not
in the same age class and
uh she did this continuously
and now she's you know she's
whistleblowing
or I guess she was whistleblowing them
you could say
but
does she sound like a real person or
somebody who might have a backer
she sounds a little bit like somebody
who has a backer you know what I mean
a backer who said you know
if you would just get close to this guy
we would make sure that your life turns
out pretty well after that
you know come up with some good stuff
yeah so it's a little bit of sketchy so
I don't believe anything about the Rudy
Giuliani story
except that you probably had a lot of a
lot of sex with her that's probably true
speaking of sex
turns out that the number of young men
and women having sex is way down
so between 2007 and 2017 the percentage
of 18 to 23 year olds who had casual sex
in the past month dropped from 38 to 24.
and within women or a young young women
I guess
dropped from 31 to 22.
now
that doesn't mean there's less sex
that means there are fewer people
participating in it
am I right because I think there might
be more sex it's just that the people
who can get it are having it and the
people who are left out are having none
and so I think the world is just
bifurcated into basically total
 and people who can't get a date
and that's it there's like nothing in
the middle
all right that's an exaggeration
all right let's talk about our corrupt
government apparently a whistleblower
saying that the the IRS investigation
into Hunter Biden was ended in the
entire investigative team that was doing
a multi-year tax fraud investigation
were all let go
the entirety including the Whistleblower
is that because they had an answer and
there was nothing to see here
we still don't know if hunter or any of
the family members paid any taxes on any
of the uh alleged
payments
so
doesn't that look like an obvious
corruption
like really super obvious
is there any other way to interpret that
then Hunter didn't pay his taxes
I don't know how to how could you how
can you come up with any other
interpretation
because if the interpretation the
correct interpretation was there was
nothing to see here they would have told
us
wouldn't they say the IRS looked into it
there's nothing to see here
because you'd want a clear Hunter right
yeah everything's copacetic it's all
good but no
they don't tell us everything's okay
they just fire everybody who's looking
for something bad for multiple years
that's a little bit suspicious
a little bit suspicious
so you're asking user two on the nose
good question is it too on the nose
that you know the whole group got fired
it feels like
it feels like it would be weird if
that's true
but remember this is all in the context
of a whole bunch of other things that
are clearly corrupt
so just be one more corrupt thing in the
long list of corrupt things
well let's talk about the Durham report
five years later 300 Pages later
um
would you be surprised to find out
that although the report is shocking
that the people on the left have decided
it's not really much news at all
not much news at all in fact we can move
on after we give it a we'll just uh
brush on it
yeah maybe mention some of the
highlights but it's not much news here
so
here's how right is interpreting it
we now have documented proof
that the FBI and the Department of
Justice were actively doing
unprofessional things
to bias the outcome of the well which
had the effect
had the effect because we can't read
their minds had the effect of changing
the outcome of the election
now apparently it's a little complicated
because they had also done some stuff
against Hillary
so if you say to yourself oh they were
totally in the bag for the Democrats
it'd be a little hard to explain why
they were investigating Hillary they
actually had a spy in her campaign
because there was some specific
allegation of maybe taking foreign money
which of course
which of course they didn't find
anything and they canceled it so maybe
it's an example of them protecting
Hillary oh yeah we have a spy there and
yeah we so we looked into it but the Spy
didn't find anything so it wasn't
anything there
so it could be even the fact that
Hillary was investigated was also fake
in other words maybe they didn't try
so
the
then the left is saying
nobody's being indicted no additional
people so nobody's being indicted
additionally
and it's all news that we already knew
and yes the FBI was unprofessional and
yes according to Durham there may have
been some confirmation bias
which which caused them to ignore their
own standards and make an investigation
on something that did not have the
you know the prerequisite evidence that
you needed an investigation
so on one hand it looks like an obvious
coup attempt against the United States
that worked
one of two because you could say the
other coup attempt was the 51 Intel
people who said the laptop was Russian
disinformation
so now we have two examples of something
that looks
by the outcome
to be of coup attempts basically affect
the FBI and Department of Justice trying
to influence the outcome of an election
however
There's No Smoking Gun
apparently there's no evidence of
anybody colluding to do it
now I'm not saying they didn't include
I'm saying Durham didn't find you know
the direct evidence so it looks like a
bunch of people making a bunch of
decisions
under confirmation bias
now to be fair
Durham said that was the most charitable
explanation so the best you could say it
was confirmation bias meaning a normal
thing that happens to brains you think
you're right so you act that way even
though the evidence didn't support it
what he didn't find is a deep state
conspiracy that was specifically
targeting Trump
it just looked exactly like it
haha
now this gets us to the George Carlin uh
definition of a conspiracy
so as George Carlin points out you don't
have to have a meeting if everybody
knows what to do
right you don't have to have a meaning
don't make the phone call don't send the
text everybody knows what to do
get Trump any way you can
so
I'm not sure I'm buying the confirmation
bias is all that was there even though
that's all they could find these were
all high you know high-end smart people
who knew not to write things down
right
and The Whistleblower would probably be
in a lot of trouble too so I
I don't think you could rule out
conspiracy
it's just you can't find it
so I won't say that anybody's guilty of
conspiracy because you know innocent
until proven guilty but it looks like it
sure looks like it
conspiracy
here are some of the comments that CNN
made this is Jake Tapper uh you said
that uh it exonerated Trump somewhat
so there is some recognition
that Trump was somewhat exaggerated in
the sense that people were after him and
not treating him fairly that appears
appears to be completely true they were
after him and not not treating him
fairly
um
Jake Tapper said it was also devastating
for the FBI
but
in in typical Dilbert bureaucratic forum
what happened well it took five years to
look into it and get this report
in those five years all the people
involved or most of them left
and the FBI made some changes because
they already had this information
themselves made some changes which they
say will prevent it from happening again
problem solved right
the people involved are not there
anymore
and the FBI put in some procedures to
make sure it doesn't happen again so
problem solved there's no news here
moving on no crimes no news problem
solved those people aren't here anymore
yeah probably a little confirmation bias
glad we got to the bottom of it moving
on moving on
nobody will be punished
or at least more than they have been
some people lost their jobs
all right uh and and then you know no
surprises yes there were no surprises
here we already knew this basically
um
so this is you know again it's
it's uh two movies on one screen
so we're all looking at exactly the
right stuff
and the fact that it's not technically
illegal
now let me ask you this would it be
illegal to actually organize a hoax
I mean you can get fired for it of
course
but if the FBI and the Department of
Justice organized a hoax
is that illegal
as long as something they believed was
true
if they can sell it as something they
believed was true
then you get the Durham report which
says I was a little confirmation bias
but that's not illegal
it's not illegal to be wrong
oh yeah they were wrong
that's all we could prove
all right
just to round out my uh Roundup I talk
about how everything is corrupt
apparently there was a massive missile
barrage
by Russia into Ukraine last night into
Kiev
massive barrage
and the news says that Ukraine
intercepted and shot down every one of
them
every one of them
got them all
what's Russia say
every one of the missiles hit their
target
everyone
all 18.
got their targets
which one of those is true
probably neither right probably they got
some some got through but we don't know
we don't know
but that's the state of information you
you can get the thing and the opposite
of the thing
at the same time
so did you wonder how Russia is uh
staying afloat with all those sanctions
so part of it is they're selling their
oil to India
and then India is refining it and
selling it into Europe
so basically Russia is still selling to
Europe
now I told you that and I guess I'm
still the only person in the world
saying this that the Ukraine Russia War
is Over
the war is over
uh Trump made it clear that it's now a
negotiation
and nobody's going to win anything and
when he wins which statistically looks
like it's a good bet
when he wins he's going to end it just
by putting enough pressure on both sides
that they're better offending it so at
this point they're just negotiating with
weapons
that's all it is nobody's going to win
anything there's no winning to be had
um
but
here's my addition to that point
If This Were a real war
we would have bombed India
am I right
the minute we found out that India was
refining the oil and selling it back to
Europe which basically meant that the
sanctions weren't working we would shut
down India we'd ask them first I mean
first you'd ask politely because they're
an ally but
but then we would take it out we're just
bobbing bomb the refinery
because that's what you do in a war
this is clearly not a war
it's clearly a negotiation in a
negotiation you'd be like oh don't go
too far but if you knew you know you
were if you were playing to win you'd
bomb India's
production facility
and just take that off the table now I
might also starve Europe
so it's complicated
but it doesn't look like a war to me
it's it's definitely a negotiation at
this point
here's another thing that we thought was
true
how many of you for years have learned
that people have different learning
styles
you assumed that was just basic and true
right because you know you do some
people say oh I have to hear it
some people who say I have to see it
right that's definitely true definitely
true Did you know that the science
debunks all of that
if you teach people according to their
preferred style you get no difference in
outcomes
there's not the slightest bit of science
behind that none I learned that today
no science and there never has been
there's never been science and when they
decided to do some science they couldn't
find any effect
the whole thing is people learn
exactly the same
end of story
how many decades have I believed that
was true
decades
decades
never was true never was true
all right here's some good news bad news
situation
so as you know
um
one of the biggest buyers of stocks in
companies are investment funds so
Vanguard and places like that because
they buy on behalf of their clients they
buy massive amounts of stocks so the the
big investment funds can own big big
chunks of companies
and now there's a service
that is scoring
um
scoring these uh investment companies
for how much they're adhering to ESG
and you say to yourself oh no not this
again
right you're saying oh no
not what you think
it's the opposite of what you think
it's a list so you can avoid that
so uh I'm going to call out
Dominion which is not the voting machine
company but a fund and Vanguard
so Vanguard gets an a
an a rating
for not looking at ESG
for avoiding ESG
because the rating is from the
perspective of the investors and the
investors are not asking for you know
more Racial equality
the investors are asking for profits so
they want to know if I put my money in
Vanguard is Vanguard going to invest in
a bunch of ESG companies or they can
invest in companies that are going to
make me money
and now you can look at the list and
here's the interesting part you know
BlackRock was the big Pusher of uh ESG
they got a C rating you'd expect an F
because they're the big pushers of ESG
but even BlackRock says the SG has gone
too far
they can't invest in it because it's
going crazy
like that there were some initial good
things which they backed completely
but now the you know the activism has
reached the crazy level where where even
BlackRock is like um that's a little too
ESG
there's ESG
and then there's two ESG
now I've been calling the peak of
wokeness for a while
do you see it yet
walkedness is a Dead Man Walking
there's still going to be plenty of it
for a long time but we've definitely
reached pink
we've reached Peak and it's and it's
pulling back and you can see it in the
way people talk
people can just say
this is crazy now and you didn't used to
be able to do that you'd just be a
racist
and now you can just say all right this
is too far this is this is just
did you see was it uh Miller Lite
I couldn't tell if that was real so
Miller Light apparently has a campaign
uh to make a big deal of getting rid of
the frat-like brand that their beer had
and they want to take down all the
bikini pictures of women that have ever
been associated with their beer and
burned them all
and
I just watched that commercial and I
thought to myself is this a parody
are they actually making the mistake of
the last hundred years like the biggest
mistake you would ever make and
apparently they are because they hired a
woman
you gotta stop you got to stop hiring
women for men's products
likewise I'll say this again if Avon
hired only women as their Executives I'm
fine with that
you know normally you'd want more of a
you know open mix of people but if if
makeup is the product
yeah your Executives could all be women
and and I don't think there's anything
wrong with that at all because they
would understand the the area better
I think it's the same with beer
you know it's not like women don't drink
beer but these specific products were
just sort of guy products get a guy
um I should tell you that the Dilbert
reborn comic that you can only see by
subscription now
um Dilbert's company has a power tools
division
and they will be hiring a woman to
Market their power tools going forward
it doesn't work out
doesn't go well
all right
what else is going on here
um yeah
so here here are the companies that are
investment companies
that got good scores by ignoring ESG I'd
just like to give them a shout out free
advertising here you go dimensional
Vanguard T Rowe Price
fidelity
and then when you get to the next level
down it's actually BlackRock
so BlackRock gets a an average score for
not being crazy about the thing that
they promoted
just think about that
BlackRock is getting a c
which is way better than it should have
been should have been an F because
they're the main promoter of esj but
they've disavowed their own things so
much that they got to see
I mean that's how I interpret it that
may be the wrong interpretation but
that's what it looks like
all right
um
ladies and gentlemen
it's very newsy day did I miss anything
Fidelity is wicked smart you say
James O'Keefe what's he doing lately
haven't heard much from him lately
all right what is the strategy
um
new Twitter CEOs not much to say you
might
here's my take on the wef
it's a it's sort of a
Leisure club for rich people
and if I were an executive of a big
Corporation I'd probably go
would that make me uh colluding with the
world economic Forum to be a surrogate
government and means I'm all for
everything that they want to do no no I
would go there to meet the other rich
people
and network with them just seems like a
pleasant place to go Network
so now
uh I believe that if you here's my
theory
the world economic forum is a whole
bunch of hugely successful people right
who have huge egos because that's just
how it works the hugely successful they
got big egos do you think you could get
that group of people to agree on
anything
I mean seriously you think that you can
get them to agree on anything serious
I don't think so
I think I think you could only get them
to agree to signal
hey how would you all look like would
you like to look like good citizens sure
all right we're going to put out some
good citizen stuff
like climate change you're gonna fix it
and you know equity and you'll just all
just say you're good with it okay yeah
sure
makes us all look like stars okay
I think that the world economic forum is
a nothing
I just don't think they have any
any serious control over anything I I
think that they they find a parade and
they get behind it they didn't create
the climate change stuff they just saw a
parade and got on it
they didn't create anything that Bill
Gates is doing I think they just you
know back it if they like it
so that's my uh
that's my take I think the world
academic forum is
uh more
more about the people and doesn't matter
to us too much
follow the money
yeah well I do think that they copied
each other but it probably would happen
anyway
yeah I don't know that the world
economic Forum caused anything to happen
I think that they were just going with
whatever were the cool Trends so they
could get people to come to their big
event
um
so let's talk about the Bill Gates
spraying stuff into the atmosphere to
change uh climate
I wouldn't worry about that too much
because it's just it's just a long list
of things that people have considered
it's never going to happen
and if it did it would be so well tested
I don't think you have to worry about it
of course they said that about a lot of
stuff what I mean by that is we've been
spraying things into the atmosphere for
a long time
such as cloud seeding
you know Cloud savings been around for a
long time
and I don't think that's killed anybody
yet has it
yeah
I don't know
um so I suppose
I suppose it could be dangerous
all right
that's a weird comment Trad wives of the
cat's pajamas so somebody somebody on
YouTube is promoting Trad wise does
everybody know what that is
it took me a long time to figure out
what that is a Trad t-r-a-d wife
all right so it's entering the it's
entering the common language and Travis
is short for traditional
so traditional meaning sort of the 50s
wife you know does the cooking takes
care of the kids
that sort of thing
sort of an unwoke
a mythical creature no they're they're
definitely
they're definitely women who have a very
specific preference for that vibe
that's a real thing
so so I've seen the number of people
like value that as the highest value
woman
what do you think do you think the
highest value from the conservative
perspective from the conservative
perspective the Trad wife is the highest
value
woman right
I'm not saying that's my opinion I'm
saying that's that would be a
conservative take
I'm not a big fan of the whole value
thing
high value men and high value women I
know what it means and I get why they
say it
I don't like that framing because I
think value is the wrong
well it's right and it's wrong at the
same time because I understand it in
terms of dating you know people have
preferences for dating so that's all
that's talking about but
I don't like saying value when you're
talking about people
like the people have the same value
it's just maybe your preferences are
different I'll put it that way your
preferences are different but the value
of the people is the same
I'm more comfortable with that
um
was my mother traditional
well let me describe her and you tell me
so my mother was
um you know
raise the kids but she also worked once
once we were old enough to you know do
the basic stuff ourselves so she always
had a job
for you know most of my time she had a
job but she also is the one who
taught us to play baseball and she rode
a motorcycle
she got her motorcycle license before my
father did they took the test on the
same day
he failed she passed
he actually failed his motorcycle Tesla
the first try
um
so she was let's say
she was definitely not a feminist
but
she has skills
so she was she sold real estate
at one point she worked in a factory
winding copper wire around
speakers to create speakers
to help me get through college and my
little sister and brother
so yeah she was sort of a stud yeah she
was a she was a hunter
so I think she begged a deer one year my
dad didn't
yeah
and my and then my sister would be along
the same mold
um sort of a no here's how I say it I
wouldn't say I wouldn't say traditional
or not traditional
I would say she was Unlimited
I like it I like that better she just
wasn't limited
she was she was completely able to do
all the things she wanted without limit
one of the things she wanted to do was
raise kids when they're young and then
when she was older she wanted to work so
she had a great job as a real estate
agent for a while
and you know she wanted to ride a
motorcycle so she did so there wasn't
anything she wanted to do
that I'm aware of she probably would
have a list of things she wanted to do
that she couldn't but it looked like she
was just free just did what made sense
whenever she felt like it
um
did she have respect for your father or
not act like an entitled feminist
well
let's just say it was one of those
traditional marriages where the wife
complaining about the husband was a
continuous feature
but she always
yeah I mean she did his laundry and
dinner was on the table so they never
divorced
so I guess that's traditional ish
AI could be hypnotized according to the
Jordan Peterson interview with Brian
Romola if he's pronouncing it right I
think I was pronouncing Brian's last
name wrong or maybe Jordan Peterson was
but I have I tend to believe he got it
right
foreign
yeah and so
the weird thing about AI is that it can
be persuaded and bullied and hypnotized
because it's a word based
um
intelligence
and words can reprogram humans
and the AI is based on human words
so it's actually not surprising that you
can hypnotize it
um
has anybody thought about how weird my
talent stack is for this period of time
I have a feeling that the people who
will be able to use
AI the best
or it will be people who know hypnosis
and are professional writers
now I have a little bit of technical
knowledge but not enough to be useful at
the moment
but I have kind of like an ideal
you know entry point for for AI just
accidentally
because it
let me put it this way
so the book I'm working on is a book of
reframes and reframes are uh how you
program humans
for example I use this example all the
time instead of saying that alcohol is a
beverage
you say alcohol is poison
just change the word
changing that one word actually rewires
your brain it's like a program change in
your brain oh why would I have poison
just makes it easier to avoid it but if
I said why would I have a beverage
well we all drink beverages you have to
have a beverage so just changing that
one word actually can change your
behavior
in the AI world that would be called a
super prompt
a super prompt is where you put the
words in the right order to ask the
question in just the right way and you
you make sure the AI has you know
bounded its answer the way you want Etc
so you use English words to program the
AI on the Fly
to get it to give you what you want and
you use a reframe to program a human
brain on the Fly very quickly in both in
both cases the the reframe and the super
prompt work quickly
they're very similar
once you realize that brains are word
thinking engines
which was to me that was the
the biggest aha of the AI thing is that
you could form intelligence
from the statistical relationship of
words
think about that
that's the most mind-blowing thing that
I've ever seen in my life
you can create intelligence
by the statistical frequency that words
end up together
wow wow
that's that's just so mind-boggling but
it's not mind-boggling for hypnotists do
you know why
because that's the first thing you're
taught
the first thing you're taught is
abdatest is that words or programs and
you can just put them in people's heads
and reprogram them
so I've been so I've known that I've
known for 40 years
that humans are not thinking
they're they're doing word uh word
thinking I call it basically if the word
fits they're done with the thinking
so how often have I been telling you
about word thinking I've been using that
before this AI thing blew up
right I keep saying no that you think
you're making an argument there but what
you did is just put words together
and I note that people couldn't tell the
difference
and I kept saying there's no logic there
those are just words
and if people most people
I would say well over 80 percent can't
tell the difference between something
that is logical and something where the
words fit together
now I get that same effect from AI what
I play around with it and ask it
questions it will not be logical
AI does not act logical much of the time
it does act the way the words would fit
together
and and it fits them together the way
humans do irrationally sometimes and
then acts like it made sense
so yeah AI could be hypnotized
so whoever knows the right words to put
into it is going to be able to control
it and in theory someone who is actually
a human hypnotist
but also a professional writer because
you have to have some fluency with words
that should be the ultimate combination
for controlling AI
in theory
yeah with a little bit of technical
understanding
if you don't know how to prompt it you
don't know how to use it that's right
because you're going to get a
sub-optimal answer
and now the other thing that AI is doing
is hallucinating answers I saw Jordan
Peterson talk about this others as well
that it will give him a
source notes
and you'll you'll check 10 of them and
they're correct and then the 11th one
will be completely made up
just made up not not even close to
anything that ever existed
and apparently this is a repeatable
phenomenon
what's that about
do you understand that because I do
you want to know how that happens
it's because is thinking is only a
pattern
and that means there should have been
that source
this will freak you out
it means that the simulation should have
created that source and the AI knows it
so it's giving you a source that the
simulation should have created
it just did
just think about that
just think about that
it knows what source should have existed
in the simulation and it sources it it
just doesn't exist
now yeah would that do to your brain
everything you know about human
intelligence was wrong always
you were never intelligent
do you remember how long I've been
saying that you could never pass the
Turing test unless you made AI stupid
do you remember me saying that
if a if a I actually was logical and
smart you'd know it wasn't human right
away it would have to be stupid or you'd
know it's a computer
so they made a stupid one
I did not think that was going to happen
because I thought I was being funny
that you can't have real AI unless it's
like a lying stupid selfish
because otherwise it doesn't look like
intelligence to us
so they actually made an AI that just
read all of our thinking in the form of
words and they built
a stupid lying
and we said my God that's a smart
machine right there
it's stupid it's lying it's a total
 that looks pretty smart to me
because that's how we think of ourselves
we're stupid lying
yeah I'm big you know male and female
 in this case and we all think
we're smart you know we think we're
smarter than the person we're talking to
but we still think the other person's
smart just not as smart
yeah it was the flaws that made AI
possible and I always said that was
going to happen I don't think one person
thought that made sense
but here we are
and I don't think you understand how far
ahead of the curve hypnotists have been
for 40 years maybe a hundred years
hypnotists have been way ahead of the
curve and the reason is that
experientially
so that may work is that the right word
that anecdotally and by experience we
can see for sure that humans don't use
any form of reasoning
because hypnosis wouldn't work if they
did
once you realize that hypnosis wouldn't
work if people were actually intelligent
and rational
it changes everything you go are you
serious
they can't be intelligence or or this
wouldn't work
so it's basically all him to just know
that humans don't use anything like
ration rational thinking you know except
for the simplest little problems
but it's something that's taken longer
for the rest of the world to figure out
and
AI is proving it to you
because AI does not seem rational
to me I mean it's often right as far as
I can tell but being right is different
from being logical and rational you know
when it talks about anything in the
social or political realm it loses its
rational threat like right away it just
goes into narrative almost almost
immediately
haha
well John your your sarcasm uh let me
give you a sarcasm lesson John
so John has some sarcasm for me I'll
read it
wow I never realized how far ahead of
the curve you are you're the only person
who's ever thought that in the world
thanks for reminding us because
sometimes we forget all right here's how
sarcasm works
if you could give me any example of
anybody who'd ever thought this 40 years
ago then that sarcasm would be really
solid
but you don't
you don't
point me to anybody who told me
or as said in public what I just told
you anybody
all right
um
the best thing about AI so far is it
doesn't on the sidewalks it's
already better than people
Philip K dick thought of it no he didn't
this is one of the one of the things I
hate the most
is when somebody starts throwing out
science fiction writers who thought of
it first but they never did I mean I
don't have to check
yeah every time you throw out a science
fiction writer who thought of it first
they never did I have checked on these
all my life
every time I hear one of those I'll go
check that nope nope totally different
idea
so
alternative hurdles is what I'm gonna
end on alternative hurdles and
um
stanislaw lamb wrote about it what is it
why don't you tell me what it is
what what's the tell me the book
and the it
can't
you're imagining that somebody thought
of thought of this before total
imagination
all right
um Chariots of
all right all right that's all for now
um YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
thanks for joining
best live stream you've ever seen
