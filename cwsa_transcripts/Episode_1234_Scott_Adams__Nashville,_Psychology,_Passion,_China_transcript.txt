hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and there's going to be a little bit of
a surprise today if you happen to be
watching me
on the youtube live feed
and that surprise is that the power is
going to go out
sometime in the middle of this broadcast
so if you're on youtube and the power
goes out
skip over to periscope or catch it on
the replay
the reason is that these stupid ipads
have one hole that you use the
microphone for
which is plugged in it's the same hole
they used to charge it
so if i want to charge it while i'm
using it
which would be the most common thing you
would do
i can't do that because there's just one
hole so
youtube you're gonna you you're just
gonna disappear in a few minutes
but uh if you'd like to enjoy this
wallet last all you need is a copper mug
or glass a tanker chalice or stein
a canteen jugger flash a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine to the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous zip code
i see in the comments that somebody says
there's an adapter that will help me
with this
i will look into that right after this i
really will
i'll look into it so are you happy that
i moved my books behind me
it was the most frequent recommendation
is to move my book so my head wasn't in
the way
but it looks like my head's still in the
way so
maybe we'll work with that we'll do a
little more a b
testing all right let's talk about that
nashville bomber when i first heard
that the nashville bombing happened
and i heard that there was a camper and
it had a
speaker on it with a warning to get away
and they blew up a phone company
i did not have to be a highly trained
fbi profiler to make the following
prediction
it was going to be a 63 year old white
guy
with an i.t background
was there anybody who didn't see that
coming
everything about this crime screamed
63 year old white guy with an i.t
background it was the first thing i
thought the last thing i thought was
foreign terrorism and uh
as soon as you told me it's a camper
it's got
and it's got like a a tricked out uh
cool technology for his uh
his explosion uh and and it was a phone
company
the one thing that you knew for sure is
that he was a dilbert fan
and i thought oh please don't call this
the dilbert bomber
it's it's gonna happen somebody's gonna
call this guy the dilbert bomber you
know what's gonna happen
all right
so i guess we're still waiting to figure
out what that's all about
we don't know his motive but uh
but uh we certainly could have guessed
who he was before before we found out
uh over in nazi china
uh the you've ever heard the phrase
never again about the holocaust
that's sort of the the slogan never
again because never again
will the world stand by when uh some
ethnic group is rounded up and
slaughtered but indeed never again is
happening
right now as china has rounded up the
weakers and
although they're not being slaughtered
yet
somebody asked me scott what do you
think about people who invest in
apple computer who allegedly their parts
are made by
uyghur slave labor to which i say
what exactly was the alternative
would it be better if the uyghurs didn't
have work
because i feel like they would be sort
of expendable if you know what i mean
if they didn't have slave labor so
while i'm not in favor of slave labor
it might be better than the alternative
that china has planned for them
if they could get some value out of them
that's probably the only reason they're
alive
so both are horrible in the extreme
but being dead is probably a little bit
worse
i don't know
and then somebody when i tweeted this
somebody said oh yeah you hypocrite
i don't see you saying anything about
israel and the palestinians
to which i say i do not make decisions
based on bad analogies
i would say that the nazi analogy is
reasonably good
under the limited situation that
somebody is rounding up
an ethnic group and putting them in
concentration camps
now if that exact thing is happening
then i think that's nazi analogy is
reasonable right
if somebody invaded poland
i would say well okay okay that's that's
where a
nazi analogy that works pretty well
hitler invaded poland but you can't use
a nazi analogy for
everything i mean on the internet we do
but i like to keep it for those things
that are right on the nose
you know a concentration camp for one
ethnic group
that's right on the nose i think that's
a fair
analogy comparison whatever you want to
call it
but when you're talking about israel and
the palestinians you've got all kinds of
other things going on
but the most important difference is
that the palestinians have a
clear ability to affect their own fate
the palestinians if they wanted to
could build a powerful region have
self-control
have nobody bother them be good
neighbors make a fortune
but they don't want that if they wanted
it they could have it
everybody wants them to have it there's
nobody who doesn't want them to have
a good life so long as they you know
don't bother other people so i think
those are the worst
analogies in the world and my my general
take about
the middle east is that the only thing
that matters is power
and whoever has the power uses it
and you don't really need to dig down
much deeper than that but it does matter
if you have
at least some amount of control over
your own fate
yesterday's poorly planned
live stream that i did here i told you i
overslept and didn't have any content so
i
just put together some stuff that was on
the top of my mind
right before the live stream turned out
to be one of my all-time most
popular live streams and so
the moral of the story is there's no
point in working hard and being prepared
because it doesn't seem to
have any impact on your outcomes well
that's not true
but in this case weirdly the less work i
put into it the better result i got
so the the thing that people were
commenting on is i i did a little
takedown of
psychology now i'm not saying all of
psychology
is bs i wouldn't know you know i'm not
an expert in that field i'm not saying
i'm not saying mental illness isn't real
some people are
interpreting that way of course it's
real the symptoms are real
if you actually have symptoms that's
that's as real as anything could be
what i was commenting on is just the
labels that they give something like
this is narcissism and this is this
other thing
when they all overlap and the symptoms
are all over the place
there isn't any reason to label some of
them with a name
when that happens um so youtube just
gave me a low
a warning so we'll probably lose i think
we'll probably get 10 more minutes on
youtube before it goes dark
but here's my take on that first of all
whenever i go after a field in which i
am not an
expert everybody pours in and says you
cartoonist
you're not an expert why are you
criticizing this field
but i would like to lay claim to the
following
i would like to say that my personal
expertise
and one which i've pursued publicly all
my life
my you know the 30 years or so of my
public life anyway
that my one expertise
is calling on other people's
expertise
that is sort of my expertise now
i don't get into the details of other
fields that i don't understand
but generally you don't need to it's
pretty easy to call
on things that are just sort of obvious
i don't call on say einstein's
theory of relativity
do you know why well how would i know if
it's right or wrong
how could i possibly know right i
couldn't know
so um
so instead i go after the low-hanging
fruit
and i want to give you some examples of
that
so that you can get it in context
i've told you that the dilbert comic
strip basically took out the whole field
of management consulting
and and i basically called on
the entire field of management
consulting which was not
my field not exactly i mean i didn't do
it for a living or anything
so that was my first case where i called
bs on a field that i was
not part of later when i and i told you
this yesterday
when i took on the personal finance
field
again not an expert but it took about
five minutes of research
to find that the personal res the
personal finance invest
investment advice industry is just
it's just people making things
complicated so that they can tell you
they have a purpose so they can take a
piece of your money
so again two examples of calling
on things that are not in my expertise
and uh do you remember when
the experts said that masks don't work
now some of you still think maths don't
work but the general consensus is
now that they do what did you see me do
you saw me call on a field in
which i have
no experience the medical field and
at least at the moment the current
thinking is that they caught up with me
not the other way around now if it turns
out later that
masks are really bad um you know we'll
we'll all revise our opinion right but
at the moment
the strong consensus of the experts is
that i'm right
right so i have quite a track record and
i could
bore you with a bunch of other examples
but i do have a long
track record of of seeing the
low-hanging fruit
in other fields not not all the details
of the field i can't tell if that's
right or wrong
but just the obvious stuff and
one of the other obvious things that i
took on was the idea that
you needed passion to be successful
do you remember that at first i first
blogged about it and i don't remember
the exact year
2011 2012 something like that
and the blog post i think it was titled
passion is
i can't find it now because i've changed
my blog enough that i couldn't find the
original post
but it was so popular that it became a
chapter in my book
published in 2013. now if the book is
published in 2013 you can work backwards
to when it was written
which was 2012-ish and then you can work
backwards from that
to when the original blog post was
written so it was either 2012 or 2011
something like that
so that's when i was saying stuff such
as passion is
and it's better to do something you're
good at and then you'll get passion
if you make money and it works out your
life is good
now since then you've noticed that that
idea has
made its way into a number of different
books and i was just watching a video of
scott galloway who was repeating almost
it sounded almost word for word from my
book so in a video
somebody asked them you know some
secrets of success and he did the
passionist speech pretty much
exactly as i laid it out
in my book now he didn't
credit me for the idea which is fine
because i don't think ideas need to be
credited
i don't think that's the thing i think
if somebody took your actual content
you know like a copy of a page of a book
or you know a photo you
took or something like that that's no
fair because that's a copyright
so it's not a copyright unless it's the
actual material that you created
or part of it it's but it but if you
just have an idea
that is catchy and people like it that's
that's not copyrightable you can't
copyright an idea
so anybody who uses an idea without
attribution
i think that's fair i don't have a
complaint with that because i use
other people's ideas without attribution
all day long
usually because i don't know where they
came from now i'm seeing in the comments
that it was
mike rowe said it first i believe mike
rowe
said you should take your passion with
you which is not the same thing
but if you can find something that looks
more like what i said
then uh then that would be good there's
also a cal
what's his name cal somebody who wrote a
book about that in
20 i don't know 2012-ish
but i think you would find that my blog
post was the original
statement of that not positive but it
does also doesn't matter
i know i didn't get it from somebody
else
but it's possible that other people were
saying the same thing about the same
time
so the point is that uh regardless of
where it came from
this is part of my history of calling
 on things and then
the public coming around cal thomas
thank you kel thomas's book
he talked about passion being
in around 2012
so i think it was after my blog post
came out
so here's the point
have i have i earned the ability to call
bs
on a field in which i'm not you know not
an expert on
i would like to think i have and i'd
like you to do some
uh i'm going to ask you a favor i want
to win a bet with somebody it's just a
private bat
you know it doesn't it's not a public
thing but i made
i made the claim that when the
coronavirus pandemic happened
that i might have been the first person
to say in public anyway that the
vitamin d pattern might be expressing
itself
in in the different outcomes in
different places
now before you jump on me i know what
you're thinking
you're saying uh scott you did not
invent the idea that vitamin d
is good for you and especially good if
you have
you know maybe a virus situation no
i'm not claiming that so i'm not
claiming
that i'm the one who told the world that
vitamin d is good for you
that's obviously been well known forever
i'm making a very narrow claim that the
claim
that the different outcomes in different
places
may have may have had as much to do with
the vitamin d levels
as it did with leadership or technique
or mass or social distancing
and so the question i ask you is
if anybody could find the periscope
the video and or tweet in march
of 2020 has to be march so here's here's
the task
see if you can find march only
and it had to be in the context of not
just saying take vitamin d
because everybody did that joe rogan did
that
um a number of people were saying that
so that part is just
standard medical care find me the part
where i said it looks like tehran has
tehran has a lot of smog and they also
have a problem
it looks like wuhan has a lot of smog
and they have a problem
and that was the time i was saying hey
where why is it a coincidence that
wherever you can't get
vitamin d easily they're also having the
worst outbreaks
now that was generalized later when i
learned that a lot of diseases such as
diabetes you have low vitamin d i didn't
know that
when i was first saying but here's the
thing i want you to find
the exact first time i said
this is the key the first time i said
there's a pattern
not just that vitamin d is good but
there's a pattern
and that it included black people having
worse
outcomes so if you can find that for me
the first time
has to be in march it could have been
february but i think it was march the
first time i said it might be a pattern
especially
noting that skin tone might have to do
with your vitamin d
uptake so if you find something from may
that's too
late only interested in march all right
sorry that was just for me so i could
win
win a bet now i know dr shiva was
talking about it
but i believe he was talking about it
therapeutically which is a different
context
i was talking about it as a way to
identify why some countries were doing
better than other countries
so see if you can find that for me all
right um
speaking of patterns here's another one
name
watch this watch this test okay i'm
going to
give you a little test and i'm going to
see if i can blow your minds
i've never done this so i don't actually
know how it's going to turn out
but i suspect it's going to blow your
minds
i want in the comments i want you to
mention two countries
that did unusually well with the
coronavirus
and then two two countries or places
could even be a state
if you want the state in the united
states pick two places that had really
bad outcomes all right
so tell me but you have to tell me which
one it is because i don't know all the
states
all right so taiwan good and good el cup
sweden norway taiwan south korea okay
now keep in mind all the ones you said
are good japan
taiwan um sweden all right so
new zealand right vietnam keep all these
in your mind right
now do the other one now do these do the
countries that had really bad outcomes
go
or states you could do a state in the
united states
tell me you had bad outcomes usa
um i don't know about australia exactly
new york
new york city all right italy italy
so i'm seeing italy and new york city do
you see the pattern
tell me the pattern bad outcomes now i'm
just
i'm not going to do all the countries in
the world i'm just going to
make the case on the ones that you
suggested all right so you suggested new
york and italy
new jersey too i think so new york new
jersey and italy
on bad outcomes there are lots of other
ones but let's use those
examples what do they have in common
and now what do the ones that have good
outcomes have in common
now remember the good outcomes are not
all asian because you got your swedes in
there
et cetera some say some would say they
don't have good outcomes
what what what do you notice about them
now let me give you a little more hints
all right here are some extra hints we
have learned that the coronavirus
doesn't seem to spread on surfaces very
easily
right we didn't know that before but now
we know that it doesn't spread on
surfaces
so we know it's airborne here's the
other thing we know
about it if you are in
let's say a chorus and people were
singing
they would be exhaling more stuff out of
their
bodies and that stuff coming out of
their bodies the air
would be more likely infected because
they're they're exhaling
when they sing do you see it yet
i i'm surprised you haven't seen it yet
i'm giving you every hint in the world
oh you haven't seen it yet i'm really
surprised
what do new yorkers and italians have in
common
that japanese do not
it has nothing to do with age now i
think density and age and
and all those things do have uh
got it somebody got it loud talkers
where are the loudest talkers
in the world new york
new jersey italy
where are the softest talkers
in the world japan
taiwan do you see it
it's it's really kind of clear isn't it
now you'd also have to factor in
age and you know probably something
about what they did and how they treat
it and
you know it's not the only it's not the
only uh
factor now i would also say that when
you're looking at the island
countries you probably have to take them
out of the mix
so i would take taiwan out i would take
singapore um
yeah i would take uh
new zealand out i would even take south
korea out
because it's effectively an island
because of the the dmc
so here's my question
number one what is the average weight of
an
asian man the average weight
of an asian man now i'm not talking
about uh
your high body fat makes you die i'm
talking about how much
air you put out when you talk do you
think that the average
110 pound vietnamese man
puts out as much air as a 250 pound
texan man probably not even close
right if you if you could measure just
the amount of
air coming out of the lungs of a sumo
wrestler versus a 110 pound
office worker i don't think it would be
even close would it
so maybe that's one of the biggest
patterns maybe the biggest pattern is
how much air comes out of your lungs
and it's a factor of are you loud
talkers and just how big are you
are you a big person or not a big person
and then how close do you are you when
you talk to people and density and all
that that matters too
all right um here's the
worst the worst to take of 2020
on the the virus this was a tweet today
somebody said yet the survival rate for
covet is 99.9
and we are told to stay home and wear
masks how about they all f off and let
people make their own decisions
i i would call that the worst take
on the pandemic it's the worst opinion
and here's why first of all it's not
99.9
it depends on your age and your
comorbidity if there was a
if there were a four percent chance of
dying let's say you were older and you
had a co-morbidity
would you take a four percent chance of
dying
versus um
so youtube's gonna crap out in a minute
here would you take a four percent
chance of dying that's pretty high but
here's the thing that's wrong with that
if if the hospitals were not impacted if
the hospitals were not impacted i'd say
good point doesn't seem to have much
impact we have other things that kill us
not much point but the hospitals are
impacted
so that matters the other thing is that
it's temporary
uh it's temporary by its nature people
are saying but
this many people die of cancer every
year or this many die of tuberculosis
but here's the thing if if we knew that
two million people might die of cancer
in the coming year
who would not have died otherwise they
wouldn't have died of cancer but
let's say there's some environmental
problem and you
you could avoid two million
cancer deaths if you shut down for six
months to take care of the environmental
problem that's causing it
we might do that so everybody who's
saying we don't do it for other diseases
it's because the other diseases have a
different character
if you if you gave it the same character
we probably would treat it similarly
if you said yeah we just have to lock
down for a few months
we don't know how long but you could
save maybe two million people from
cancer
we might do that if it were temporary
you know and there was a specific thing
to be solved in that year
and the other thing is statistics it's
like saying
there's only there's only 10 people who
have aids so
i guess we don't need to worry about
aids only 10 people have it
why would you worry about something that
only 10 people have
well you worry about it because more
people are going to have it right
that's how it works and also because
vaccinations are on the way
there's you know there's a time limit
obviously and then also there are lots
of long-term illnesses
it appears so even if you do survive
you're 99.9
you might have something like a 20
chance of a permanent
long-term problem does that feel like a
good odds to you
20 chance that if you go outside and you
ignore social distancing
20 chance you'll have a long-term
permanent health problem
are you okay with that well how about
the fact that
if the young one out the people who
really do have not much of a risk
that they would uh if they got infected
they could bring it back
now the news is saying that there's very
little chance if you're
asymptomatic that you're a carrier but
i'm not sure that means as much as you
think it does
because i think the reason that we make
people who are asymptomatic wear masks
is tell me the reason we make
asymptomatic people wear masks
if the whole idea is that you're trying
to stop the germs coming
out of their mouth the mask is not
trying to stop the germs
or not the germs but the virus from
coming in
so what would be the purpose of wearing
masks
if we could prove that asymptomatic
people are
zero risk and it looks like it looks
like that might be actually
kind of close to reality so let's but
let's say it is
let's say something like that happens i
don't think it's quite confirmed but
we're heading in that direction
let's say that asymptomatic uh spreading
it just doesn't exist
would you tell people who are
asymptomatic to wear
masks some people are saying it's a
virtue signaling
nope it's not virtuous signaling
uh if you didn't make the if you did not
make the asymptomatic people wear masks
nobody would mirror a mask now when i
say nobody i don't mean
literally nobody so somebody would but
the only reason
that symptomatic people wear masks
is that they would stand out if they
didn't
that's it the other masks if it turns
out that they don't make any difference
if you're asymptomatic
the other masks are purely to identify
anybody who's not wearing a mask so i
don't think it has anything to do with
the virtue signaling i mean that may be
part of why people do it in their own
minds but i don't think that has
anything to do with why
it's a it's a um it's a guideline
it's a guideline because it's the only
the one that would work
the moment you said no if you think
you're coughing
if you think your coughing is from a
cold
well that's not really asymptomatic is
it so why don't you use your judgment
about whether to use a mask and then old
coffee
mc coronavirus goes out in public coughs
up the entire
subway and says i didn't know i had a
i thought i had a cold i thought it was
i thought it was uh pretty sure i just
had
an allergy i had a little dryness
a little dryness in my throat but
definitely i didn't have any symptoms
yeah i'm a little hot a little bit of
fever
sure yeah i can't smell things but
i feel like that's from my allergies
sure i can't
smell anything but sometimes that
happens when i get a cold
you see where i'm going there's no
practical way
you could have any kind of an effect
telling only people with symptoms to
wear masks it just couldn't work
so i would say it's a persuasion thing
jake tapper says you won't have kaylee
mcaney on his show
because she's a liar to which they say
is there anybody on cnn who's not a liar
i didn't even know they booked people
who weren't liars
really i mean the whole show is lies
so it's just funny there's a writer
named arwa
maradawi i think for the guardian or
something
and somebody called her out for two of
her statements
both of them in writing one of them she
said
men are less likely to wear masks
another sign that toxic masculinity
kills
but not long after that she said if
women are hesitant about the vaccine
it's because the health industry hasn't
earned their trust
that's right if men ignore
science there's something wrong with men
but if women ignore science there's
something wrong with science
this is an actual opinion of a real
living human
now do you see the observer problem
it's a phrase you're gonna hear a lot
the observer problem is
maybe it's the observer who's the
problem if you know what i mean
and
so let me ask you this if if narcissism
is a mental illness as we've all been
told
why is awokeness not because
if you have that let's say there are two
kinds of uh narcissism i've learned
recently
uh the grandiose narcissism is the one
we always talk about where you think
you're
better than other people etc now i don't
think it exists it's not a real thing
in my opinion there's a longer
description of that but
here's the thing i learned yesterday
also that the people who have that
narcissism
are more successful and happier than
other people
is it really a mental illness if you're
more successful and happier because i
thought
the whole mental illness idea was that
you're less happy
and or less successful isn't that kind
of built into mental illness
so you see the observer problem let me
give it to you this way
let's say uh you're chewing your food
and you're near somebody who doesn't
mind hearing you chew food
because you can always hear it a little
bit but other people
are really really bothered by you
chewing food
who has the mental illness the people
the person who is chewing just eating
normally they're not chewing loudly
they're just eating
do they have a mental illness or does
the person who's
bothered by it to the point where they
can't even be in the room have the
mental illness well you'd say that's the
person who's bothered by it right
but why is it with narcissism
that the person who's perfectly happy
just like the person who's eating and
chewing
minding nobody's business perfectly
happy
why did they have the men the mental
problem but the person whose life is
being ruined by
it because they can't stand this person
they can't work with them
they can't be around it just like the
chewing why is it that the person
observing it isn't
the one with the mental illness because
they have all the problems
see where i'm going on this you can't
separate the observer
from the observed the observer is the
sick one
all right so
that's my uh main thing about narcissism
apparently there's another kind of
narcissism where you don't think you're
wonderful
that's you know you have
you have more of a victim mentality but
that's a different kind
that that surely exists at least in
terms of the
the symptoms are real all right uh
there's part of me that's wondering if
all mental illness
and here's where i'll really get in
trouble there's part of me that wonders
if all
mental illness is about whether you
think you can control your reality
or not whether you think you can control
your reality or not
now i've only thought about this for a
few minutes
so i'm not trying to debunk any mental
health
people so i'm not i'm not disagreeing
with anybody i'm just sort of putting it
out there
i notice a commonality among
you know and i'm not going to say all
mental illness that would be crazy but
i'm wondering if a lot of it
a lot of mental illness comes down to
whether you think the world
is controlling you or you control the
world
now i'm not saying that either one of
them is true it is not true that the
world controls you and it's not true
that you control the world
there's an interplay there but i wake up
every day believing i control the world
and i feel as though i have tremendous
mental health
because every day i wake up and say well
if that's a problem i can change that
if if i made that mistake i can change
that if i'm not good enough i can get
better
i have a complete sense that i can
control the world
now imagine if you thought that people
were after you
and you know they could hurt you and
people have said bad things about you
and you can't handle your i
i feel like you know obviously there's
an organic part to mental illness it's
not
it's not just you're not just thinking
your way into it
but i got to feel i got a feeling that a
lot of it would go into those that
category
of whether or not you can control you
feel you can control your life whether
it's true or not
um people of faith believe
god is the controller that is an
excellent point thank you

i do think that it's useful to put your
sense of control in a third party and i
think that that's one of the things that
religion does really well
independent of what's real and what's
not real in your religious belief
it's just a good technique to imagine
that control
is with this friendly character who's
got your best interest
in in mind i think that's good for good
mental health too i think religion is an
excellent technique no matter what you
think about the reality of it
so uh
anyway let's talk about wokeness again
here's the definition of mental illness
significant changes in your thinking
emotion and or behavior
would you say that the people who became
woke had significant changes in their
thinking and emotions
i think so would you say that the
wokeness people
are distressed or they have a problem
functioning in society
because of their awokeness philosophy
i would say so so if
wokeness has all the characteristics of
mental health meaning it's bad for you
why is that not a mental illness but
narcissism the grandiose type
is literally good for you and makes you
happy and more successful
and that's considered a mental illness
now you can see it right
it's the observer problem it's the
observer who has the problem
not the observed all right
that is what i wanted to say today and i
think i'll end it early so that youtube
does not crap out on me
which is going to be probably in the
next minute i think
so i'm going to shut you down on youtube
and say thanks for watching and we'll do
more tomorrow
