good morning everybody
and aren't you
lucky yeah
you made it to the best thing that's
ever going to happen to you it's called
coffee with scott adams and every day is
better than the one before but not as
good as tomorrow tomorrow's looking
really good
how would you like to take it up to
levels that humans have never
experienced before
you would and all you need to do that is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker gel
style in a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better you can feel it starting already
can't you it's called the simultaneous
sipping is happening now go
savor it
savor it
okay
well
so uh dilbert is uh still going after
esg
uh we've got another comic today so here
uh dog bird is talking to just some
character who's uh
who's a
head of some business
and uh the title of the comic is
dogbert's esg rating service so dogbert
has become
an independent rating service for esg
those exist by the way
so if you're a big company
you can pay somebody to go look at
how much you're polluting and
discriminating and they'll give you a
score
and i thought what could be a better job
for dog burp
than something that's totally subjective
so dogbert
is talking to some ceo who is unnamed
and dogma says your core business
involves giving digital lobotomies to
other people's children
what business is it
so dog bird is talking to a ceo you
assume your core business involves
giving digital lobotomies to other
people's children
right
tick tock
yeah but it's not just tick tock right
it's it's social media
but then dogberry says uh but you don't
pollute as much as you could and you did
ask for my pronoun
so i'm giving you the top esg rating
and the ceo is looking at he goes this
feels right
and dog bird's wagging he says i think
we're making a difference
now
this would be the
third day
of a week of esg mocking
and i've noticed that the esg people the
people who care about it
um are starting to pick it up and tweet
it
once i get a full link
i'm gonna
put them all together and publish it as
you know larger content
and then it's going to be hard it's
going to be hard to avoid seeing it
if you're in the esg business
so
doing that for you because you asked me
to kill esg
and i said i'd get it done by the end of
the year
so
so we're going to mock it out of
existence by the end of the year we'll
see i don't think it will be out of
existence
i don't mean that i just mean that its
reputation will go from growing and good
to
oh
that's really that's what you can
accomplish uh oh
maybe we shouldn't do this
so look for the
the negative articles on esg to start
popping up
sometimes you have to go first
so one of the things that dilbert does
as a comic is it goes first
so i can kind of soften up the room
and then the regular journalists can say
oh okay other people are mocking this i
can mock it too
you have to sort of wait for somebody to
mock it first before the
the timid people come in
actually wall street journal today has a
somebody saying as a piece saying esg is
useless and costly
but you would you would expect that in
an opinion piece in the wall street
journal
all right i uh
uh i complained online today
because there's an app called app um
youtube tv which is different from
regular youtube
so youtube tv is an app made by youtube
where you can it's like a cable tv thing
except you just use your internet and so
you can see all the regular channels and
all the cable channels and
it's and the the interface is
spectacular by the way
if you're if you're going to watch
television
the youtube tv has the best
best interface you've ever seen it's
just great
but there's one little oddity i
discovered
that of all the channels that you could
watch
there's one that consistently doesn't
work
it glitches or the sound doesn't match
the thing or you can't fast forward it
where it defaults back to the beginning
a whole bunch of different errors but
there's only one channel
what do you think is the one network or
channel
on all of the channels what what do you
think is the one that doesn't work
no not mine no because i i'm not on that
app
i'm on youtube
but i'm not on youtube tv
youtube tv is just tv
right that's just tv
fox news
fox news
so i asked
other people
if they have the same problem i did a
little
and then somebody said you should do a
poll on this and i said
you're right i really should do a poll
on this
because uh youtube tv did respond to me
right away
because i said something on twitter and
they noticed right away and they did a
real good job of responding
so a plus four
responding quickly
and a plus four interface
it's really a well-made product it
really is
but so whatever's happening with the
fox news channel
we don't know so that's the open
question but i asked people if they're
having problems or is it just me
because youtube tv reached out and said
maybe
you should reload the app
reload the app
but
it's the same on my apple tv and my ipad
and my old iphone and my new iphone that
i got this week
do you think the problem is that
reloading the app is going to help that
one channel
it's an app that has just one channel
with a problem just one
and rebooting the app is going to fix
just the one channel
do you think there's any chance that
that's going to work
no
so instead i did a poll and i said if
you use youtube a tv app not regular
youtube just make sure you're you're
clear on that there are different apps
does the fox news channel work for you
without glitching
now if you subtract out the people who
just wanted to see the result which is
most of them because most people don't
have this app
it was 16
said yes it works fine
and 12 percent says it glitches often or
always but remember
those percentages are after you take out
the people who just wanted to see the
answer
so the 12 and the 16 if you were to
treat them as
the only ones that mattered because
they're the ones who have the app
everybody else doesn't even have the app
so if you just look at them about uh
uh 12 out of 16 would be uh three
quarters
there are three quarters as many people
who can't why can't watch that channel
uh i mean that suggests that there's a
there is in fact
oh yeah i'm doing the math wrong but
don't worry about it the point is
don't worry about the math the point is
that 12 and 16 aren't that far apart
meaning that there are a whole bunch of
people watching that channel who can't
get that one channel to work
is that a coincidence
now i saw a comment from somebody
apparently on reddit people had been
talking about this as well and i read it
and somebody said
that somebody at youtube tv now this is
all low credibility i don't know if this
is true
somebody at youtube tv suggested it
might be the feed coming from fox news
meaning that they treat everything the
same but if they get a bad feed
what are you going to do
do you believe that
do you believe that fox tv or fox news
who appear to be among the most
technically capable
people around
and yet
and yet they're the only channel
all the other channels can send a clean
signal but it's just the only one that
can't
you believe that
now
other people said that there are other
apps
like the roku app where they have the
same problem
where it seems that fox news is a
problem now if that's true
that would actually
at least be suggestive that the feed has
a problem
but i don't think you're seeing the same
problems in each app
i'll bet you if you looked at the roku
app and the apple tv or the youtube tv
app at the same time
even if they both glitch
but it's not at the same time
i'll bet it's not i put a big bet on
that
because if they glitch is the same time
then it's the feed
you know you've eliminated the other
options
i don't think so i think it's going to
be different mistakes that are that are
unique to fox news
that's what i think
now
where do we have the
when do we use the uh
let's say assumption of innocence
versus the assumption of guilt now in
the legal system
because as humans and we want to do the
best we can for them assumption of
innocence is the standard and we all
agree with that
but in this specific case
so this is not really about any
individual
it's about whether a system
is working the way it should in this
american experience
should you assume that if you see
something like i'm seeing
is my assumption should my starting
assumption be innocence and it's just a
bug
what do you think
is it reasonable to assume
that this is just
the coincidence
is it reasonable
i don't think it's reasonable to assume
that anymore it's entirely possible it's
a coincidence
yeah let me be as clear as i can
if i had to put a bet down i don't even
know which way i'd bet
i mean it looks like a coin flip to me
it's definitely possible that it's just
a bug
it's definitely possible
i just don't think that should be your
starting assumption
now i was i was going to not talk about
it in public because i thought you know
the odds are so big that this is just a
bug
that it would be embarrassing if they
say yeah the feed was bad and then they
prove it i'm like oh okay i made a big
deal about this and it was
it was just a bug
but i think we're at a point in history
where the institution has to be assumed
guilty until they can demonstrate
they're not
what do you think
is it is it inappropriate to say that
the institution whether it's
google or youtube or the fbi or the
government or congress it doesn't matter
who it is the media fox news any entity
just any any public
you know facing entity
i don't think you can assume that
they're innocent
i think you have to assume they're
guilty if you see
anecdotal evidence suggesting it
that's what i think
plug my prints
okay i will did you know you could go to
dilbert.com and get a legal authorized
copy of any of my strips if you want to
use it in business or something else if
you want to write an article about it so
the esg strips are are perfect for that
a lot of people are probably writing
about that topic so whether you're
writing pro or negative on that topic
you might want to license those strips
a
tip for the esg free state you mean what
should we do to get rid of esg
well what we should do is what we're
doing
we need to mock it out of existence
there's no other way really it has to be
mocked
all right
so mike lindell the mypillow guy
who's now more of a my slippers guy
seems like
but
he was going through a drive-through and
the fbi surrounded him
they pulled their cars up and blocked
his car
imagine this happening to you
this this happened in america
that they wanted to serve him with a
subpoena i guess or a warrant and get
his phone
and they they waited until he was in his
car
and they somehow followed him to a fast
food place and while he's in line they
surround him with their fbi cars
now he did say that they were just
polite and professional and they didn't
have any kind of attitude or anything
so i'm going to give a i'll give a
compliment to the fbi agents
because mike lindell did
so mike lindell said
they did a good job i'm going to pass it
along so that's for the agents
themselves
but was it ever okay for them to even do
that in the first place
i mean i'm sure they did it on orders or
something but
that feels like a public humiliation
with no purpose
it also feels like
intimidation you don't think they could
have called them
you don't think they could have called
them and said hey we're gonna somebody's
gonna come down at 10 a.m
and we've got a warrant we're going to
ask for your phone
could you answer the door make sure
somebody answers the door and bring your
phone with you
what was he going to do leave the
country
did they think that mike lindell was a
flight risk
but did they think he was going to hide
his phone
and let me ask you this
why do you need access to the phone
how much is on the phone that's not on
the icloud
i'm wondering if you even need phones
anymore don't you just need
but wiping it doesn't help anymore does
it
does wiping help
if you wiped your phone clean it'd still
be in the cloud right or there'd be a
backup in the cloud or
i don't think you can wipe a phone
anymore can you
i don't
if it's apple
yeah
you can delete it all
you can delete the phone but i don't
believe you can delete your icloud
records because there would always be a
backup
winther
you you tell me there's no backup
of your icloud after you think you've
deleted it i don't believe that
i don't believe that at all
anyway so i know there's some technical
questions i i wonder about might not be
important
but
doesn't it look like this is political
does this look legal to you or political
again
do we give the fbi the benefit of a
doubt
the assumption of innocence
has the fbi earned the assumption of
innocence
nope they have earned they've earned
this is an important question they've
earned a presumption of guilt
they've earned it
i didn't do it
if you're looking at me don't blame me
like look at the comments everybody's on
the same page i didn't do it
it wasn't my fault right the fbi got
that themselves they went out and
got themselves an assumption of guilt
so
uh i'll apply that
and it does look like my uh what was the
last time somebody mocked me for
suggesting that republicans would be
hunted
do you remember how much mocking i got
the first several months of the biden
administration
when they couldn't find all the hunting
i had predicted
nobody's mocking me now are they
have you seen even that one troll come
after me and say lately lately last two
weeks
hey where's all that haunting you
predicted scott
where are all these republicans being
haunted
i don't see any of that
they all shut the up didn't they
yeah yeah i guess i i guess i served
them a nice dose of shut the up
didn't i
i mean i didn't do it intentionally i
was just sitting here
but the news
delivered them a nice heaping steaming
pile of shut the up
because the hunting is happening
now
i've made some pretty unusual
predictions that have come true
this one might be more unusual than even
some of the other ones
i mean who's ever who has ever made that
kind of prediction
right
has anybody ever made a prediction that
the other team would be haunted after an
election
in the history of the united states
probably never
and yet i made that prediction
that people laughed
mocked me
mercilessly
and then they got a big old dose of shut
the up
reality is awesome sometimes
i saw a uh
a i think it was on instagram a little
real a little bit by joe rogan
and he was saying that success is
meaningless if no one loves you
like there's no point to it
you know you could go out and succeed
and really make something of yourself
but if nobody cares
i'm not talking about strangers
i'm talking about like in your actual
personal situation if nobody loves you
like for who you are and really cares
about what you did
none of it matters
i mean it matters to the world
and
i have to say this this hit me a little
bit hard
because while i do feel you know lots of
love from the audience
lots of love from you know just people
who are dilbert fans and stuff and i do
feel lots of love from you know
community and
friends and stuff but i'm not uh
but i'm not in a relationship right now
and i have to tell you this this hit me
because there are parts of your life
which you experience alone
and then they disappear
it's weird to not be able to experience
life as a
shared experience which is that's sort
of the weird situation i'm having now i
do share it with you
but i think you would you would
acknowledge it's different from you know
being in some kind of relationship
so it's a very
weird and unsettling experience i'm
having
which is a hundred percent of my efforts
are to benefit
you
they don't really benefit me
and well except you know whatever
reflected
you know credit i get i guess but i have
to say that i don't feel it
like
i don't feel it like you would if you
were sharing it with somebody specific
you know what i mean
it's
the and i'm going to give you a little
uh micro lesson here i wasn't planning
on it but
um
i'll never get another beauty like
christina somebody says it was a big
blunder to let her go
well you know
beauty isn't the only criteria
um is but one
anyway
the micro lesson was on treating life
like a video game
and uh like gamifying
gamifying your actual life and i've been
doing more of that lately
for example
if i am
folding my laundry
i could frame it in my head as oh god
folding laundry
boring i want to do something
interesting but instead i treat it like
a game
so i try to do it in the most efficient
way
and i say okay the game
is to see how quickly and efficiently i
can do this and then i sort of enjoy it
because you know that i've got a towel
folding technique that just feels fun to
do
and it's then it becomes like a skill
game
and then i get through it and i like it
and i i managed to do that with a whole
bunch of other things you know little
boring things or
etcetera or even getting in trouble or
even business things
you know to me i treat them more like
there's a game with rules
and here's my little my little challenge
and i gotta i gotta get past that
challenge but
i'm writing this in my upcoming book so
you might see this again
but
one of the things that video games do is
they don't give you typically
they don't give you all the resources
you need to win the game
at the start of the game
you have to go get them
so you don't have all the energy you
need or life or weapons you have to find
them along the way
but you don't know where they will be
you just have to
you have to trust
that if you play well you're going to
find stuff
and if you the longer you play the
better you'll be at finding stuff i
guess
and
i treat the actual world like that
and it works really well
because the actual world does serve up
resources
in surprising ways just like video games
so if i say to myself i want to
accomplish x but i don't know how to get
there and i don't have the resources to
do it
i never say don't start
because if you did that with a video
game
you wouldn't play
so instead i say what's the what's the
only thing i can do now maybe the only
thing i can do is
do a google search
or ask somebody a question
it's all i can do i don't have any
resources or even know what to do next
but i do that first step
and then i see if i get a resource
for example
um the process of writing the book i'm
writing
here was the process i didn't have the
energy and i didn't have the resources
to do it
and i didn't even have a great idea for
a book
now one day i got this idea of doing
something about reframing
and i just wrote it on my whiteboard you
know reframing book no title for the
book or anything just sort of an idea
once i wrote it down
and looked at it every time i saw it
i started thinking you know
i should at least at the very least
i should see if there would be you know
some chapter titles that would fit into
that
and i just start i open up a document
and i put
reframing book you know working title
and then i just say what would be in
that
and i think of some examples and they're
just bullet points
and they're just bullet points that
would become maybe chapter headings at
some point
and then i look at it and say huh
this looks like it could be a book
and then i get i get a resource
right i get an energy
from having done something that looks
like oh this could be something then i
imagine it
then then i shared it i shared it with
you
i shared it on live stream that i was
thinking about it then people said yes
yes write that book
we'd love to have that book
and then i got a resource
i got energy
so i didn't have the energy to do it
i simply trusted like a video game that
if i started walking forward i could
figure it out
and and and i figured out i needed
energy
and so i went to you i said hey i got
this idea and then you gave me energy
and i thought oh people really want
to see this book
now that's different
because if it's the publisher who wants
to see it that's interesting
but that's different than if the public
wants to see it right and it's different
than if i just want to make a book
so now i've got energy then i go to my
uh
i go to my agent book agent they say got
this idea
and he looks at the idea and he says
i love this idea we definitely sell this
idea
let's talk to your favorite publisher
i talk to my favorite publisher and they
say we love this idea
now i've got all the energy i need
i got audience i've got a publisher i've
got my agent and they're the ones that
know the most right
it'd be one thing if a stranger said oh
do that but when the experts the people
who know what a what needs to be the
book
to sell when they tell you that
something well that's energizing
all right
so then
i started writing and of course it's
hard and it's boring
and i fall asleep and stuff so you know
you know my story of trying to work
through how i can stay awake and have
time to do it and stuff
it was a separate process
but now i've i've gotten to the point
where i've got 36 000 words
and they and all the chapters are
stubbed down so every every chapter has
at least a paragraph
that i'll maybe plump out a little bit
but once you see a book with
um
probably
90 reframes in it
and
35 000 words
you know you have to finish it
you have to finish it right because
you're not going to leave half a book
if you have my personality some people
could but i don't i don't have the
personality where i can leave something
that pregnant and then walk away from it
don't make any jokes i know you're gonna
but
so that's the process the process is you
you don't understand that there's energy
you understand that you're in a game
in which the energy will be there if you
look for it
but you got to go get it
right
now you will be amazed how many times
gamifying a real world thing
makes sense
somebody just mentioned starting
let's say looking for a job
how awful is the process of looking for
a job and going on interviews
really awful
right you don't like it but what if he
gamify it
i have a friend who used to do that he'd
go on interviews
not because he wanted the job sometimes
there were worse jobs than the one he
had
but he gamified it he said i'm going to
enjoy going on this interview and going
through the process in the process i'm
going to get good at interviewing
so one day he went for yet another
interview that was below the job he
already had
she does the interview because that was
his process he had a system
his system was he'd always do the
interview even no matter what the job
was
so he does the system finishes the
interview and the
hiring person says you know you're way
overqualified for this job this isn't
really the fit for you
however
the boss of the person in the job we're
trying to fill is also going to be
leaving
you might be perfect for that job
so he got a job and a promotion at the
same time accidentally
and he took it
because his system was they would just
put him in situations where good things
could happen
no specific good thing
i mean specifically it's a job but he
just put himself in a situation where
over and over again
luck could find him
if he stayed home thinking about a job
or just did some google searches how is
luck going to find him it's not going to
find him he's hiding
but he didn't hide from luck
he gamified his experience said yeah go
on another interview this will be fun
i'll just enjoy the process like a game
he's doing great just ran into the other
day career is just killing it
all right
um
does it bother you when you hear people
called election deniers
does that phrase just get to you a
little bit like
you know
what about
election skeptic
would that bother you
election skeptic
because
i have to admit that some of the
skeptics
bring it upon themselves by making it an
absolute it would be one thing to say we
need a system where we can have more
confidence
perfectly reasonable request
it is not reasonable to say
that you know with a hundred percent
certainty
that that let's say 2020 election was
was stolen
in a
important way
it is not reasonable to say you know it
for sure
does anybody disagree with that
i get how big the signals are
the signals are like just flashing
but how many of those flashing signals
have been debunked so far
like all of them
or almost all of them
so he says none
well there wasn't any kraken
was it there wasn't any
venezuelan general involved with
anything
yeah so here's what i suggest i think we
should have a name for the other side
the people who believe elections are
definitely
totally
no doubt about it
absolutely
good don't we need a name for them
i'm going to call them the election
gullibles
because you'd be gullible as hell
if the reason that you think the
election was valid was
because the least credible institutions
that we've ever seen in our human
existence
told you they were fine
because you didn't do an audit did you
did any of you audit the entire election
in 2020 i i didn't
i was busy
maybe other people did
so if other people wanted something and
tell you about it
you don't know what happened you only
know what they told you
am i right
if somebody else does an audit and then
they tell you what happened
you don't know what happened you only
know what they told you
so
the people who are just absolutely
positively convinced this election or
any other election had no problems at
all
they're gullible
now they might be right
can you handle that nuance
they could be gullible
for believing somebody who shouldn't be
believed
but sometimes it might be true
it might be true that the election was
fine
i i'm completely open to that by the way
i'm completely open to it might have
been fine maybe maybe just there were
more mail-in votes and
maybe people just wanted to go to sleep
at night and recount in the morning when
they had more votes coming in by mail
maybe
who knows
right
you know the
i just want to toss this down here as a
possibility but
the people who wondered why the
elections were stopped overnight
wasn't it because there were still votes
coming in
and there was no point working overnight
if he knew he had to come back in the
morning anyway because there'd still be
votes coming in
because it seems like they kept finding
them right
i don't
somebody says no i'm just floating that
possibility
all right well there's some things that
we don't understand but i'm going to say
i'm going to start using this the
election gullibles
because if the least credible
institutions in the world told you
something was good
you don't have any evidence
you're gullible if you believe it
to be absolutely true
you're not gullible if you simply act as
though it's true
that would be actually just a reasonable
thing to do
we we can act as though it's
true
i think we do
lindsey graham
[Laughter]
yesterday was such a weird day
because both the republicans and the
democrats just completely failed in
their political messaging
so lindsey graham dumbass
decides that this would be a good time
to introduce a bill to ban abortion
nationwide after 15 weeks
now
i'm not going to give you any opinions
on abortion
because i have a
everybody okay with that
you don't want to hear my opinion on
abortion because i have a
so
if you want an opinion on abortion ask a
woman
and uh then tell me what she said
all right that's that's my view on
opinion
i'm going to take the
exception option out so that because i
don't want you to be thinking about my
opinion on abortion when i tell you this
story right this is just a political
story the political story is why the
hell
would you bring up the one thing that
can destroy your election possibilities
when everything is going well for the
republicans or largely
and then you bring up the one topic that
could derail everything
now somebody said he does this every
year this is he he floats the idea every
year is that true but that wouldn't be
an explanation for why he did it this
year yeah it doesn't matter that he does
this every year
i mean maybe that's his explanation
but it's still insanely dumb if you want
your team to win
now since that's just an internal
political thing that's more his problem
and the republicans brought problem but
it's fun to watch
i love watching a politician make a
mistake that not one of us would have
made
would you have made that mistake
seriously would you
you would have known not to do that
right
i feel like everybody would have
so i don't maybe he has some you know
four-dimensional game that we're not
seeing
and it could be that he's just being
consistent
it could be
but it's a it's a weird time to be
consistent
a weird time to do it
at the same time
joe biden was giving his uh
celebrating the end of inflation while
even cnn was showing at the same time
the stock market plunging 1200 points
because nobody believed that inflation
is done because the new numbers were so
bad
they weren't so bad but they were they
were not good
now what watching the uh
you know watching the images of all
those happy democrats celebrating when
the world was burning
was just the worst just the worst and
dana paredo
did the best job of you know
eviscerating the democrats on this as
she noted before you put on an event
check the calendar
you know basic stuff
check the calendar you don't want to put
on this event the same day the numbers
are coming out
if you've even waited one day or doesn't
you know done it one day before
then it's not so much a story but having
the same day as the numbers
that was a risky play
well
another thing that i learned in the news
today is did you know it's illegal to
kill people in their sleep
even if they haven't come
that just feels like it shouldn't be a
law
so the specific here is there was a 15
year old girl
who was repeatedly raped by a man in his
30s
and at one point at knife point
so there was violence involved
we're not talking about statutory rape
so it's not just that she was underage
she was actually
raped by force
at knife point
at one point the guy fell asleep
and she got access to the knife it was
on the bed stand or something and she
stabbed him to death
you know as he was presumably woke up
while he was being stabbed to death
and she was convicted of
involuntary manslaughter and willful
injury
she won't necessarily serve time in jail
so she looks like she's going to get a
deferred prison sentence
but she could serve you know 10 years if
she violates probation up to 20 i think
but here's the weird part iowa has this
mandatory rule
that if you're found guilty of this
crime and this kind of situation as she
was
that
that she has to pay the family of the
deceased
150 thousand dollars in restitution i'm
not sure how they calculate it
so she has to pay her rapist
150 000 they rape his family because
he's dead
now
let me ask you this
what is the definition of self-defense
now here clearly it's being defined as
not immediate danger
but if you've been repeatedly raped
by a guy with a knife
and he falls asleep for a minute and you
knife him to death
are you telling me that's not
self-defense
because i get the whole it's not a media
thing
but it's guaranteed
if it's guaranteed but not immediate you
can't kill somebody
it's guaranteed
that when he wakes up he's still going
to be a rapist
right if you put me on that jury
i would have hung that jury so hard
there would be no way in the world
they'd ever get me to vote guilty on
anything
now i get i get i've been on juries so i
know the judge would make sure that you
knew it's not your jury it's not your
duty
to find justice
that's not the job of the juries
the juries are not there to find justice
that is not their job they are there to
determine if the evidence
demonstrated that the crime had been
committed
that's it
and it looks like that's what they did
and i've often said that serving jury
duty is should be
just something you should all do
just to feel how serious
the people on the jury take this stuff
like until you feel how serious
your fellow citizens are about getting
it right on a jury you don't feel the
country's cohesiveness
it's easy to feel like we're not
together but boy you take 12 strangers
from any any demographic group
you put them together and you say you're
in charge of this guy going to jail or
not
they take that job really seriously
and when you see that that gives you
faith in the whole thing right so it's a
very important process if you want to be
a good patriot
good citizen do
do jury duty at least once you got to
experience it
but anyway you put me on that jury and i
wouldn't give a what the
constitution said
i wouldn't care what the law said i
wouldn't care how many angry jurors
there were who waited too long
there is no way
no way
i would have
allowed this
15 year old girl who ended her own
horror by stabbing to death the
who had raped her
i would give her an award i wouldn't
there's no way
that you could not torture me enough
to vote guilty on this case
am i wrong
how many of you how many of you would
allow her to be convicted
yeah i mean how do they find 12 people
who are willing to do this
and i think the answer is
so here's the answer
once you get in that situation
you take it so seriously
that you do end up respecting the system
over the person
and i think that's what happened
i think the people were there respected
the system
and i don't hate that
i don't hate that because i like them
respecting that system
but it cost it cost her some justice
this was not justice
was not justice
all right
uh cnn's reporting that more more than
half of the gop senate candidates
doubted
the 2020 election
that sounds about right
half of them doubted it but again
if they didn't use the word denier
i think doubt is fair
don't you think
i think people could have doubt about
institutions which are part of a
system which is entirely not credible
i'm not worried about that
i'm not worried about half of them
doubting an election
um
are you
does that bother anybody that half of
those candidates doubted the 2020
election
that doesn't bother me at all
yeah not at all
um
there was a hilarious
uh trending thing aaron burnett from cnn
her name was trending on twitter
so i thought oh let's see what this is
and i go there and it was
she was trending because she was talking
about the hunter
biden laptop
and how it wasn't russian disinformation
you know basically she she told the
story
the way you know the story
what do you think cnn viewers did
when aaron burnett accurately told a
story of great importance to the country
how did the cnn viewers
handle
an objective reporting of true news
that is important to the country
[Music]
i'm never watching this channel again
and you have to read the comments
to even know that these people exist and
why i say these people
i mean apparently
this is just my interpretation from the
comments
there was a there were quite a number of
people who watched cnn
who were not aware
that it was trying to be news
[Laughter]
i don't think they understood that
i think they understood it as a team
member
and as soon as the team member started
giving news they're like whoa
that's not what we signed up for
we signed up for you to be on our team
why are you on the other team and if you
look if you look at the comments
it's entirely clear
that the reason they're angry
is that their team isn't being supported
they're not angry about the accuracy of
the news
they're not complaining that it's not
true
and they're not complaining that it's
not important
they're only complaining that they
didn't back their side
and they're acting like that's the job
of a news news
entity but you know that's cnn's own
fault right
cnn created a product
that even the people who watched it knew
was not news
think about that
their own viewers knew it wasn't news i
wasn't sure that was true
but now we have something like
confirmation
didn't you always wonder didn't you
always wonder if cnn viewers let's say
all of them
believed they were watching actual news
but it turns out that they knew they
weren't watching actual news they knew
it was just team play
now you see the same thing with fox news
right so i'm going to burn all of my
bridges here
you when fox news reports a story down
the middle
you should see all the screaming
people go nuts oh no that was an
objective statement there i can't handle
that i will never watch your network
again
so just like the fox news viewers
there's no difference the cnn viewers
are watching what they what should be
news
they're just watching it as a
team member
so
all right um
this is a funny story
i forget where i saw this i wish i
remembered
but apparently there are phrases that
are turning off younger job seekers
all
right so the i don't know if this is
true at all yeah because we always
everybody always complains about the
next generation right so take it with a
great assault how much of this is true
but anecdotally it's just funny so i'm
gonna report it like it's true
but apparently the young people who are
not so big on
working too hard you know they're
looking for more of a work-life balance
nothing wrong with that
they've
there's some phrases they see in job job
postings to scare them away
so here's some here are some of the
things you shouldn't put in your job
posting if you want anybody under 30 to
apply
you don't want to say must handle stress
well
[Laughter]
you don't want to say willing to wear
many hats
you don't want to say
responsibilities may include
those outside the job description
and here's one that's funny
we're one big happy family
and the reason given
the reason given for why
young people don't want to see were one
big happy family
because it
suggests they're going to abuse you
one big happy family makes young people
think that
that's a signal for abuse
maybe it is that's even funnier
um
another one is uh applicants should be
humble have you ever heard that before
whoever says applicants should be humble
i've never heard that one
but i wouldn't i wouldn't work at a job
that required it
yeah because i i don't think i could i
don't think i could pull it off
[Laughter]
all right
also also bad ones are looking for
self-starters
nobody wants to be a self-starter
okay this was a
survey by payroll processor paychecks
oh god that's funny
so
do you remember when uh hillary
clinton's
lawyer sussman
he was accused of lying to the fbi
in saying that uh
no i'm not i'm not high in case you're
wondering
he was accused of lying to the fbi and
saying that he was not working for
clinton when he brought them information
that was maybe bad about trump
and do you remember he went
so he was pro he was uh
taken to trial
do you do you know what happened in the
trial
how many of you know
what happened with sussman don't look it
up
and don't say the answer just say if you
know
do you know do you know what the end of
the result was
yeah dc jury is part of the hint
i just wondered how
most of you knew
yeah okay most people on locals know
on youtube you see yes no the answer is
that he was acquainted
that's it he didn't according to the
legal system he is a person who did not
commit a crime
it wasn't a hung jury
it wasn't a hung jury 12 jurors said no
you did not commit a crime
did you see that coming
and i think it had to do with the fact
that he was in the room with only one
person
when
when the alleged um claim was made
so i believe his defense was
i say it didn't happen the one person in
the room says it did that's your whole
case
and if i were on the jury and that was
the evidence the one person in the room
said it happened
the other person in the room said it
didn't happen
i wouldn't i would have acquitted
wouldn't you
now this isn't like the you know the
woman who stabbed her rapist to death
because that was justice
killing that guy was justice but you
know if it's a little paperworky
lie kind of a thing
i think i would favor the system over
the
over punishing an individual right
and the system is pretty clear you need
evidence for crimes
they didn't have it
they had one witness but it wasn't
enough so
he walked
but now durham is winding down it looks
like and it looks like there won't be
any
attempted prosecutions
so we did you think that durham was
going to uncover the deep state and
find all the bad things they did
looks like he may have found out a lot
of information
but the early signals could be wrong
could be wrong but the early indications
are nobody's going to get charged with
anything additionally
so
but
in the process they discovered that
igor denchenko
who worked with uh christopher steele to
develop the russia collusion stuff
so christopher steele talked to
some russians
one of the russians he talked to to get
information that was fake
but it was put in the steele dossier to
you know get at trump
that one of the russians they talked to
was on the fbi payroll
we're just finding that out
the christopher steele source was the
fbi itself
now not really because it was a paid
informant right
but
basically he got information from the
fbi and gave it to the fbi
and we're just finding that out now
now of course it was fake information
that he got from the fbi to give to the
fbi
but that started off the whole thing
now again you know fog of war who knows
maybe some of the details here are
exculpatory but
that all sounds pretty bad
jonathan totally writes about this so
look for jonathan turley's piece
if you want to see the smart lawyer take
on it
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to near the conclusion of what
was the finest live stream in the
history of all things
best show ever
how do i feel about
turley he's the best
he does great writing and analysis
yeah here's another thing you should
trust
podesta in charge of 300 billion in
climate stuff
let me give you some optimism you want
some optimism
there's
one
technology
that's probably going to be well besides
ai
there's one technology that's
you know there's a lot of action
and it's going to change everything
or not
depending on where the technology ends
and that's battery technology especially
massive storage not just for your car
but for the network like you know giant
batteries for storing
network power
and it turns out there's a bunch of
companies and i keep
doing little research on each one as
they pop up
and once you start looking into them
and then you also know that part of that
infrastructure bill that biden got
through
a big part of that is for battery
development
so a big part of it is to keep these
startups we're making new kinds of
batteries in business because the
current batteries that they use in cars
it looks like the total worldwide supply
of materials to make them is about this
big
and the number of electric cars that we
think we want is this big
they're not even close
so we're like maybe one percent
something like that probably one to
three percent
of the batteries that we'll need to have
a
world that's you know
where the power is always on and you're
not burning coal basically
but the good news is this
it seems to be well-funded
you know the government's billions are
going in that direction
but they also have private funding
and a number of these technologies look
pretty good
look pretty good so a number of
technologies have already
gotten to the point where they've
developed a working battery
and from working battery to you know
being able to scale up to make lots of
them and sell them and stuff is a lot of
work so the the odds of getting from a
working prototype
to a big industry important companies
small
small
now everybody who's talking about
solyndra
here's the difference
if you're going to look at the stock
market in general let's say as an
investor if you're going to pick one
stock
and put your money in it
what is that called
stupid
stupid
because diversification is sort of the
only thing that works for investing
so if you put all your money in say a
company like solyndra
that is dumb by definition
but if you're the infrastructure bill
and you freed up billions of dollars
for the industry of batteries so you're
giving it to a bunch of different
companies and you don't know which one's
going to work
that's good management
that's exactly what you should do that's
like playing by the numbers basically
so yeah so everything you say about
cylinder you just forget it
forget it
you know having the government in the
industry get too close is a bad idea but
funding research into new battery types
that's what the government's done well
before our government has
spurred industries we know that works
be transformed by the renewing of your
mind huh
yeah we don't it would be good news if
we didn't think that money would be
wasted by political people trying to
steal it
that's true
what about the wef
well what about well dogwood's going
after esg so i'm going to go after it on
a topic level
um i do think that
who gets to make the decisions
is what all this wef stuff's about right
and the problem is
uh
that the wef takes your control away
from you and gives it to strangers
uh how long does it take me to finish my
coffee after the show i usually get i
usually throw away whatever's been
sitting here for too long
so i i have coffee most of the day until
maybe
four o'clock
all right
any other uh
your local paper didn't print your esg
well i've got some more that are not
gonna get printed too so i did hear that
one paper has already canceled me
so i want you to know this is expensive
for me
you know what i said i'd go after esg
i knew it wouldn't be cheap i mean it
could be it could put me out of business
easily
we'll see
yeah somebody says the
was it the st louis post dispatch
cancelled me
somebody said
but find out if it was just for the week
of the esg
because if it comes back they may have
just taken them did they say they
cancelled it
did they announce it was cancelled
they downsized
they may have just pulled some comics
um
but we'll we'll look into that
keep at it
um
zero strategies
censoring scott
um
all right
i think we're done here
are we i think we are all right
everybody
i have heard of silva mind control
talk about that later bye for now
