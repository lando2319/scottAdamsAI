good morning
and welcome to the highlight
of your entire existence
and that includes valentine's day
now a lot of you are going to have
incredible sex today
and still
this will be better
yeah
i know
i know it doesn't seem possible but you
just watch
now
uh as i was just watching uh before i
got out here on youtube i was watching
the memes stream buy on locals
subscription platform
and
one of them was that today's singles
awareness day
is this the worst day in the world to be
single
i don't know it might be
so uh let's take it up a notch let's uh
let's have a drink
do valentine's day
and all you need is a cover of margaret
glassey tanker chelsea stein it can
change your flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
aren't you glad you made it for this
wow
go
okay in the comments
how many of you are having sex right now
anybody
am i the only one
no i'm just kidding
um i'm not
all right uh okay some of you were
attributing i i realized that i gave you
that uh little set up there and and you
grabbed it you grabbed it
all right here's a little uh safety tip
for you two tips
number one have you ever seen those
automated traffic
um speed signs in your neighborhood
so there'll be a little wheeled cart
that the police will put there it's got
a little radar on it and it's
uh there's no person there
it's just a robot and it tells you what
your speed is
now when you see that your speed is
above the speed limit what do you do
when the robot is telling you that
do you slow down how many of you slow
down because the robot told you to slow
down
probably a lot of you that's why they do
it
do you know what i do
well i have a degree in economics
so that's how i see the world
and is there anybody else here before i
give you the answer before i give you
the answer is there anybody else here
who has a degree in economics
probably right there's somebody here and
don't give don't give away the answer
if you have a degree in economics you
say to yourself
is the police force
which of course has a shortage of
resources because everybody does do you
think the police force is going to put a
robot there
that slows you down and then also a
speed trap
it's the one place in the world you can
guarantee you're not going to get a
ticket
because the economics of it would be
absurd you know slow people down and
give them tickets at the same time
so when i see one of those i'm like oh
free pass i guess i can go whatever
speed i want now i'm not saying i speed
up
i'm just saying that
if you have an economics filter on life
as soon as you see that thing you say to
yourself
well i guess i don't have to slow down
it's the only place i can go today that
i don't have to worry about a ticket
now
let's take that concept and i'm going to
expand it and extend it to something
that's closer to you
how many of you use encrypted apps
because you feel safer
anybody
who uses an encrypted app
because
if you got that encryption
you're all safe right
okay economists
anybody any any economist
if you were let's say the cia
or some intelligence agency
would you
go looking around in just everybody's
everybody's unencrypted
messages looking for the good stuff
or
would you likely put all of your energy
into looking at how you can get into the
encrypted apps because that's where all
the good stuff is
the economics of it guarantees that the
place you're most likely to get caught
doing something terrible
is on an encrypted app
now maybe not immediately
it might take them a while to figure out
a back door
i don't know if they crack the apps or
if they just coerce the management or
they
they get an insider that they bribe
however they do it right the
intelligence agencies can just chip away
at it until they succeed
because there's no cost in failure
if you can't crack it well you just
didn't crack it but you're going to keep
trying until you do
and the intelligence agencies of course
would succeed in the long run
one way or the other either by human
corruption or
you know cracking the code with quantum
computers or god knows what
so
i would say to you uh get rid of your
encrypted apps because what they're
going to do is lure you into saying
something that you should not put on an
app hear this really clearly
if you have an encrypted app it's going
to make you feel safe
and then you're going to put something
in that app that you should not ever
write down
am i right how many people have written
something in an encrypted app because
they said well
at least this is safe
don't
everything you write down is
discoverable there's just no exception
to that
all right that's your advice for the day
um congratulations to jared uh
kushner
and uh avi berkowitz for being nominated
for a nobel peace prize for their work
in the abraham accords
now
this is the second time they've been
nominated is that right and how does
that work can you be nominated time
after time
i i'm not sure if there's any kind of
eligibility you know per year or
anything like that
i guess you could
but
um
this is a quite an accomplishment and
you know what's interesting is that
trump is not nominated
is that weird
how did any of this happen without trump
it doesn't really make sense does it i
mean it just seems such an obvious snub
you know
maybe the problem here is um
you know and nobody's disputing that uh
that who did the hard work was uh
jared and avi they obviously did the
work
but doesn't the president get a little
get a little bit of something
and nothing
i mean that feels a little unfair
you know i get that not everybody is
putting in the same amount or type of
work into every project but
i mean i i can't imagine it would have
happened with a different president
but with all credit to
avi berkowitz and jared kushner
so
uh
god
so mass mandates are going to end
tomorrow
in california
allegedly but not for students
so this is how absurd things have become
so yesterday you know it was a super
bowl obviously so how many people uh
celebrated with other people
for the super bowl uh in the comments
how many of you were in some kind of a
group situation
pretty much
probably 70 percent of you right
did anybody find themselves in a group
situation with friends where anybody was
wearing a mask
anybody was anybody at home
or had somebody friend some friends home
no masks right
now so in my
in my uh neighborhood
the kids went to super bowl games
because you know the kids are involved
whether it's directly or indirectly for
them they're always there
so the kids were in some big crowds you
know all weekend
then
probably something like half of all the
kids in my town were involved in a
sleepover
someplace
over the weekend right everybody within
a certain age group they're all doing
the sleepovers do you think they're
wearing masks
no
no nobody is
so you have this massive
like close quarters mingling
and the only time that they wear a mask
is in school
inside
and do you know what is the one thing
you can't do
in school
inside the building
you can't get really close to other
people
because that's the time you're going to
be sitting in your little chair
right it's the only time you're not that
close to people but as soon as they
leave they take the mass off and they're
hugging each other and they're crawling
over each other and they're giving
hickeys and they're making out and
they're hooking up and they're you know
they're passing bombs around and
whatever god knows thing and having
sleepovers you know there there'll be a
pile of kids in a sleepover
[Laughter]
so literally the safest place those kids
will ever be in terms of covet the
safest place
is when they're sitting in desks
that have to be at least a few feet
apart from each other all the other time
they're all on top of each other like
like a
big old big pile
so everything about this is just upside
down and crazy
but at least tomorrow ish
mass will be off now for some of us
locally the masks have been off for some
time and i can tell you that only once
was i ever asked to put on a mask only
once
in the last few weeks
and that one time was a local business
and i didn't want to make trouble for
the employees so i complied
um
all right apparently 70 percent of
americans according to a monmouth
university poll
70 percent of americans want to accept
covet 19 and get on with their lives now
this poll was published at the end of
january
so
the last two weeks have been pretty you
know
pretty important in terms of
understanding where the pandemic is so
wouldn't you imagine that the 70 percent
want to accept coven and just get on
with life
that's higher than 70 now right
because it's only going to move in one
direction
so i would say
75
what have i been telling you about the
magic number 75
well it's it's coincidentally
you know if you take 75 percent of
something what's left over is the
the solidly stupid 25 percent of the
public
25 percent of the public just shouldn't
count
for anything
because they always get every question
wrong the thing i don't know if it's the
same 25
maybe it's a different 25 for every
question
but
if 75 of the public wants something
this is obviously a good idea as this
how often do they get it
and i think the answer is almost always
i mean maybe not on day one
but with that with a super majority of
75 percent
that's as close as you can get
to 100 of the smart people
right because you have the 25
of dense people that can't be reached on
any topic no matter what so if you can
get the 75 of the public for anything
it doesn't matter what the question is
if 75
are there
the government has to give it to you
it just has to because there's just too
much pressure
um
so i think we're in good shape there now
some have asked what about denmark that
uh dropped its restrictions recently
and is experiencing a huge surge in
um their stats
uh a negative surge
so there's you know more infections and
more deaths and everything so did
denmark make a mistake
the the data
suggests that as soon as they dropped
their mandates
things went things went south
well as andre's backhouse points out
there are other countries that didn't
drop their mandates and had very similar
curves
so you have to be careful who you
compare them to that's the first problem
so the first problem is
we've still never figured out why some
countries do what they do
we just don't know why some country will
go up in another country will go down at
the same time while doing the same
things
why can they do completely different
things but get the same result we don't
know any of that
so if you're comparing what denmark
had as an experience
to other countries that's first of all
absurd because we know that's not going
to tell you what you think it is
secondly
as was pointed out by others
our statistics right now are a weird
blend
of the carryover from the delta
the crossover from mostly omicron
so now we've got this blended data
that's not really telling us about the
future
or the past
it's like a future past
like we somehow we averaged the future
in the past and what i mean by that is
the omicron
predicts of fewer deaths in the future
the delta predicts more but they're sort
of merged in the data at the moment
eventually it'll be pretty much a full
omicron data set but not yet
so at the moment all of our data is
useless
basically
because you don't quite know what's in
the mix is it the bad stuff for the good
stuff omicron
so any comparison of denmark to anything
else is probably
useless at this point there's not a big
enough
difference
in denmark to say that it has anything
to do with the
change of their their plans
anyway um and then you've got the
problem that
uh omicron is so weak relative to the
past
that you have tons of admissions
of people getting in the hospital who
just coincidentally have it
so in the old days
with delta
if you had delta
and you were hospitalized there was a
really high chance that it's because of
the delta
right might be comorbidities but it's
the delta that's really making the
difference
but today you could be in the hospital
for damn near anything and still have a
high chance of having omicron that you
didn't even know you had
so suddenly it looks like the hospitals
are getting filled with omicron people
but only by coincidence
not because of omicron
but by coincidence they also have some
mild omicron
so
the the caution here is that all of our
data is going to be useless for a while
and denmark isn't the only place that's
going to apply
right so everything you see about data
whatever skepticism you had a month ago
just you know triple that for about i
don't know three weeks
and then maybe the data will settle down
into a omicron only
more sane way to look at it kind of a
world i don't know maybe it won't but
anyway we don't have we don't have a
history to look at that makes our lines
make sense anymore
um
whatever happened to the giant problem
of illegal immigration on the southern
border
does anybody know what happened
why do we stop talking about it
what well you're saying winter
but isn't winter the right time to go
am i wrong
i thought summer was the wrong time to
go because it's too hot
but isn't winter exactly when you want
to go
so
um did it just slow down because it's
the the coolest part
of the best time to go and it'll be a
little bit better in a month
or why are not why are we not hearing
about the
caravans being formed
so if it's still going then why aren't
we reporting on it isn't it still a
problem wouldn't there still be videos
of huge masses of people crossing
so here's the question
there's something going on
because
well i don't see fox reporting it i'm
seeing i'm seeing here that fox is
reporting it but i haven't seen anybody
report it lately
and i don't know if it's just because
other news is more interesting
but it feels like
here's my macro point here
so
independent of whether there is or is
not a major problem with immigration i
assume there is
but we're not hearing about it
does isn't this exactly the kind of
story and i'll give you another example
a little bit
where
it's obvious that the media decides
what's important
and at the moment the media both the
left and the right
so so i see you're saying that fox
reports it every day but i read fox
every day and i don't see it
not reported the way it used to be
reported in terms of you know a disaster
it's more like it gets thrown into a
conversation i think if fox reports it
today
it might be just like an add-on to
another story right
you know why are we defending ukraine's
border
when we don't defend our own so i would
agree to agree with you that fox does
sort of include it in a lot of
conversations but i don't think it's a
story
they've not done a package with a video
lately
i don't think so
so here's here's the thing i think you
have to be careful
what you worry about
and maybe this is one of those things to
add to your
how to reframe your own anxiety
one of the things i remind myself
is that i'm only worrying about things
people told me to worry about
which does not seem to correspond
exactly to what's important
because there's somebody who wants you
to worry about something
and they have the influence to make it
happen then you start worrying about
this thing that somebody put in your
head
but it's not your biggest problem
it's just
the thing somebody told you to worry
about
so when you yeah and fentanyl is weird
like that too because every once a while
we'll talk about it but then it'll just
disappear
as if it's not killing 50 to 100 000
people a year
it's just weird
so
just be hyper aware
that how
the degree to which you're being
manipulated
because they just took things that
people were on fire about and just
decided that you're not on fire about it
now you're going to be thinking about
something else
i have four words to describe the
ongoing story about
bob saget's
cause of death
leave bob saget alone
next story
uh how about that super bowl
so i watched
enough of it to feel like an american
and i swear sometimes that's why i watch
it
yeah i'm not a big sports guy
as you might know
i like playing them i'm not big
spectator type i'm a big fan of
participating
but watching uh
you know
it's hard for me to do
so um
here is my
sort of uh impression of the whole event
ignoring the sporting part of it for a
moment because that'll be talked to
death
one of the things that i'm reminded of
is that
racism is not just a problem
but it's also a business model
which causes some weird things to happen
and by a business model i mean that
there are individuals who benefit from
the the racism topic so if they can keep
it going they've they've got a reason to
be on tv reason to sell books
a reason to be etc
and so what would happen to a problem if
it got solved
and yet there were a whole bunch of
people who benefit
by it not being solved
you know i was asking the same thing
about
you know how many people in the cia are
russia experts
versus other kinds of experts it makes
you wonder if if you just have too many
experts of one kind
even if you solve the problem for which
you had those experts
don't they have to
kind of tell you the problem is still
there
like what if climate change got solved
tomorrow
you know it's not it won't be but what
if it were what if climate change just
got solved
you know somebody came up with a fusion
reactor that you can build in a year and
it's totally safe
well what would happen to all the
scientists
whose entire careers depend on
scaring you about
climate change
would they say yay we're done we're
going to change fields now
some some would
or would others just say you know
sure we changed the problem the way it
was but what about this new version of
the problem
what about that
what about the the thing you weren't
thinking about
huh that what about the different way of
looking at the same problem
so you always have to say to yourself if
there's a business model around a
problem can you ever solve it because
there will always be somebody telling
you it didn't really get solved it just
got transferred into a different form so
now you have to worry about that new
form
and watching the super bowl reminded me
about
let's call it direct racism
so i think there was a time
in human history
where if you said hey my group of people
are awesome and this other group of
people there must be something wrong
with them
you at least
at least have some observational basis
for it
meaning you may say hey look my city is
doing great
and this this other bunch of people you
know have not developed technology or
whatever they don't have much money so
we must be the good ones and they must
be the bad ones
now as it turns out
it wasn't because of their genetic
makeup and that's something we know in
2022 that
everybody is succeeding
in all kinds of fields and you know it's
more about the individual
so
the the direct kind of uh racism is
largely dead because once you've got a
black president
and then the super bowl really rubbed it
in
the super bowl was a whole bunch of
black millionaires
who were athletes
with a halftime show that was primarily
black millionaires
and the biggest
controversy around it that wasn't
sporting related
was why don't we have enough black
coaches
in our league that's 70 black players
and pretty much everybody well i will
say everybody but
but society largely looks at that
question and says you know that's a
pretty good question
right
i mean you do have your people pushing
back on it because it's irrational
it is irrational because if we're not
complaining about the 70 of the players
being black
you really have to question the logic
of questioning any percentage
like there are reasons but maybe those
reasons are racism you don't know
so
as i'm watching this the super bowl is
really one of those things and then even
if you looked in the uh the rich people
box there'd be a whole bunch of white
people up in the
the expensive seats but also
almost all of those boxes probably had
you know famous black uh athletes and
billionaires and entrepreneurs and
and whatever
so
and when america watches the super bowl
who's thinking racist stuff
like
i mean i guess it's in the sense that
it's always in the air yes
but when when americans watch the super
bowl
it's just about america isn't it
does anybody have any other feeling
about it like it just feels like the
most
perfectly american thing
and it is so wonderfully free
i mean just spectacularly free
of what i would call historical classic
racism
where you just say the people who look
like that are bad and the people look
like me are good like that part's just
gone
because there's so many individuals who
have excelled in from every category of
life
and even more directly the lgbtq
community
is you know just
like a rocket just doing great so as
long as there are lots of individuals
who are excelling
that old kind of racism went away but
not the business model
so you still needed some racism
right even though the direct stuff seems
to have gone away that's where the you
know the um
where you get the stuff like systemic
racism etc but the trouble with systemic
racism is
it's really more about class isn't it
that rich people do well and
if you're not already rich you've got
quite a barrier to break through to
become rich
so
so it seems to me that uh the whole
racism thing
has become something of an absurdity
and
the absurdity is that we're not treating
all poor people alike
when we just watched the most
the most revered american tradition
lately anyway
the super bowl
where
it really is an enormous celebration of
black achievement
i mean it's really really impressive if
you look at the individuals and the
level of talent that was involved there
in in all kinds of different fields
so
uh i feel like we're just in this weird
situation and i guess it all came
together
when the only person who kneeled
or is it knelt
the only person who knelt
at the super bowl was did you watch it
the only person who got on one knee
to protest racism in the united states
was
the white rapper
in a black business
eminem
the fact that he was the only one was
just perfect
because that that that capped the
absurdity of the whole thing
now do you think that um
the police brutality against
uh black motorists or black suspects
were stopped by the police do you think
that ended and kaepernick got what he
wanted
or are we being clearly signaled that
that was never real and it was just a
media invention to be anti-trump
i mean that was just sort of
anti-republican the anti-trump thing
right so as soon as biden's in charge
and the democrats owned the congress
well suddenly the problem went away
and the only one who didn't get the memo
was the white guy
right the white guy didn't get the memo
so eminem was like oh i get i guess i'm
still two years ago
so
i don't think that we
i don't think that we're making a big
enough deal about how far this country
has gone
and this is one of the things you have
to do every once a while it's easy to
you know complain about
what's not right yet
because that helps you work on it you
know it's good to complain
because it tells you what to work on
but every now and then you just have to
pause and say
damn
things have gotten really good
relative to where they have been in the
past
but still work to get work to do i guess
all right
um
here's a reframe for um
racism
in order to be racist
you have to irrationally take credit for
the accomplishments of strangers
which doesn't make much sense and i use
this example
so thomas edison and you know his
company invented the light bulb
the modern light bulb
and he was white
and i'm white so i get some of the
credit right
how does that work
how do i get credit
for just having a coincidental similar
pigmentation
like well i didn't do anything i wasn't
even bored
so
how in the world do i get some credit
because white people invented a lot of
stuff it doesn't really work that way
it just doesn't work that way
so
i i think it's a useful reframe
that if you're finding
i i guess this is where it starts
people say they find pride in their race
i feel like that should be discouraged
i'll bet that's offensive to you some of
you isn't it
let's see if i say it again let's see if
this sounds offensive i don't mean it to
be offensive
but
you should never take pride in your race
that's irrational
you should take pride in perhaps what
you did
i think you could arguably take pride
in what a child of yours accomplished
i i would extend it to that because you
have a lot to do with how a child turns
out
but
how would you be proud of anything else
like it doesn't really make sense to be
proud of anything except what you do
or as i said maybe a family member that
you've helped in some way
right
so
i every time somebody says they're proud
to be black
or proud to be white it just sounds
racist as to me
it doesn't matter who says it the the
moment you say you're proud of your race
like i'm not even sure i want to hang
out with you anymore
i don't care what your race is it's like
if you're proud of that you're proud of
other people's accomplishments
i'm not comfortable with that how about
be proud of your own stuff for a change
so there's a story about
the biden administration
officials at the u.s cyber security and
infrastructure agency you know the cisa
or urging a judge
to not show us the dominion voting
system's
audit i guess
so some kind of audit in georgia of the
dominion voting systems
and the biden administration doesn't
want that audit released
now
to be clear
the audit does not allege as far as we
know
any fraud
because i think people are taking the
story wrong
i think people are taking the story as
they found some fraud
and they're trying to hide it but that
is not the story the story is that
allegedly
and it's still allegedly there were some
security holes
now security holes
means that there was an opportunity
perhaps
for something to happen not that
something happened
so
does it make sense for the biden
administration to
block that
presumably because
they say it would be
bad for cyber security
or election security
right
do you think that's a good enough reason
that whatever came out of this would be
bad for election security because you
could make the argument
that the
if if the public knew how the audit was
done and what it found
that that would teach hackers how to
hack the system
is that true
do you think that would be the case that
it would teach people how to hack the
system
and if we have a system that can be
hacked
is is the problem that the heck
if it's even true that this information
could be harmful you have to take those
systems offline right away
am i right
you would have to if you believed that
there was an audit that legitimately you
see if you believed it and i would say
that i'm well short of believing this is
true by the way
so i wouldn't take anything about this
story as verified yet
but if it were true that there were
security flaws that would allow somebody
to change an election
the moment you know that's true
your strategy is not keep it from the
public
right that's not the strategy
the strategy should be take them offline
immediately until you can fix them
all right um
let's talk about ukraine
uh apparently china is not evacuating
their embassies
so what does china know that
that the other people don't know well
i'm wondering if uh the united states
evacuating its embassies was just a
signaling move what do you think
i think that we were just calling
putin's bluff
by saying if you're going to attack the
country
we're ready and we're evacuating our
embassies or pulling down staff
because not only are we calling your
bluff but we're preparing for the
outcome
so i've got a feeling that china does
not need to call anybody's bluff
so don't you think china is signaling
that they know that there's no imminent
attack
or is china
in uh in league with
russia
and they're trying to help russia
mount a sneak attack
by acting like they don't know oh we
don't think there's any attack and then
russia attacks and you say darn even
even china was
surprised
i don't i don't feel like china would be
working with them
on a trick
i feel like china just knows that
there's not going to be an attack
so that's that's still my
prediction is that there won't be an
attack or at the very least
if there's an attack it would not
involve wherever they have their
embassies
so they might know it won't won't
involve
just that location
um
it seems to me that putin is negotiating
so well by threatening with military
action that he's got ukraine kind of
negotiating with itself
do you know what i mean
have you not heard people say well why
don't we give russia this or you know we
could say
we could say we promise not to join nato
you're basically a lot of people are
floating ideas
for how ukraine or nato could
give up something
but you don't really see the same thing
happening on putin's side
right i mean we float ideas but there's
nobody in russia floating an idea
about how putin should change his mind
so i feel like putin has uh
has his adversaries negotiating with
themselves which is a sign that somebody
doesn't know what they're doing meaning
that people negotiating with themselves
are
sort of lost and they're just flailing
but then i heard this interesting
factoid that i wondered how important it
is it sounds like it's important
that ukraine has built into its
constitution
that it will try to get into nato
to which i said
i don't think ukraine knows what a
constitution is
a constitution isn't a business plan
that's a business plan
or a strategic plan maybe
but
a strategic plan might be
we we have every intention of getting
into nato that would be a good plan
that's not something you put in your
constitution because if you put it in
your constitution then if the situation
changes you can't change your mind
are
that's not really jen is it
i can't tell if that's something
impersonating chad or actually jen
um
so
am i wrong that it was a gigantic
mistake to put uh
to put the nato thing in their
constitution which they can't easily
change
it's like a gigantic mistake right i i
feel like this is like a
a dilbert problem
on a global scale
that they they confused the constitution
of the country with a business plan
and they put the wrong thing in
and that now they have a paperwork
problem that's going to cause them to
lose their country
for paperwork
i
i think that's happening
do you think that russia would be
treating ukraine the same if their
constitution didn't say we have to be in
nato
because i feel like russia could count
on them maybe changing their mind or not
joining nato
if they didn't have it right in the
constitution that they had to
or at least had to try
and
i think it's more and more clear
especially since i got a little
background on this whole putin versus
hillary clinton thing so i guess hillary
clinton putin blamed hillary clinton for
activating the
protests against putin in
2011 i think
and then in 2016 putin may or may not
have returned the favor by trying to
hack something
related to the election
so you got that background
going on
and you wonder how important that is
but i cannot for the life of me figuring
out how the united states is worse off
if russia owns ukraine
i'm not saying we should abandon them
i'm not saying we should do something
different
i'm just confused
as to why we're not better off
instead of worse because let me ask you
this how many problems has ukraine
caused the united states in the last
five years
am i right
look at the number of problems ukraine
has caused the united states now how
many of those problems would we have had
if ukraine and russia were basically the
same country
none
none right
so at the moment
ukraine looks like this big expensive
problem that we're pumping money into
and because of corruption
it's know it's ruining our politics
because you know we've got this biden
under biden connection to it
it's ruining our nato alliance i mean at
the moment it's getting stronger but i
think that's temporary
uh
i feel like ukraine is nothing but
trouble and by the way we caused that
trouble ourselves
by trying to build a base on russia's
doorstep
like why did we think we were going to
get away with that
it wouldn't work the other way i mean
they couldn't have built a base in our
doorstep
so
like why are we fighting the idea that
the superpowers should have a sphere of
influence around them
when we have one and we think it
probably works pretty well
and
you know so i guess there are a lot of
questions on this ukraine thing that
we're not thinking about too deeply
um do you know what cnn stands for
cnn stands for
certainly not news
i don't know if anybody's used that one
before
um
okay
so
so fox news of course has been reporting
on the the durham's latest filing
and
the idea that uh the clinton
campaign was paying somebody to spy on
trump and get into his computer stuff
and
and then i see this
john brennan had briefed obama
at one point on clinton's purported
proposal uh
from one of her foreign policy advisers
to vilified donald trump by stirring up
a scandal claiming interference by the
russian security service
so apparently this is in evidence
sufficiently so that it's part of the
durham report
which would say that brennan and obama
knew for sure
that hillary was doing a dirty trick
about this russian
connection
and that they either tacitly
approved it
or at least ignored it
shouldn't they all be in jail
shouldn't shouldn't john brennan and
ex-president obama be in jail for that
how is that not a huge crime
um
i'm not sure what crime it would be
actually
but shouldn't it be a crime for the
president of the united states and the
head of the cia
to be aware of a campaign
trying to overthrow an election with a
fake
a story that would
potentially plunge america into war
if they were aware that she was doing
this they should have shut her down
immediately
and if they didn't they were part of it
you know i actually googled uh rico
yesterday
because i wasn't quite sure what it
takes to make something a rico situation
but what we're seeing here is very
clearly
now it's being laid out um
a conspiracy that obviously included
obama the cia
i'm sure we could connect it to the fake
news right
so you had the the fake news people cia
and obama
and the clinton campaign all conspiring
to do dirty tricks
that not only would change the nature of
the who got elected potentially
you know trump got elected anyway
but could have actually caused a nuclear
war
so that you know creating trouble with
russia
is actually
risking nuclear war
in order to win an election
now
i don't think there's anything i said
that's necessarily on the books as
illegal is it
i mean people can talk to each other and
say bad things and
people can lie and people can start
rumors and i don't think that's illegal
but
at some point there's got to be
something illegal about this
right
there's got to be something illegal
about it
somewhere i feel like there are so many
laws
that you could make anything illegal if
you try it especially something
complicated like this you tell me
there's nothing illegal in this whole
situation
no no lawyer could come up with a law
that
directly or indirectly seems applicable
here
and and the weird thing is again this
won't be you know reported
the the whole thing
entire story here won't even be reported
by the the mainstream press
all right um
all right
that
is about what i want to talk about today
and i think
done a good job
um
hacking is a crime sure
but that's not what the clinton campaign
is accused of
um
bearing false witness i guess that's
yeah carl bernstein still not around
now it does look like the
um
yeah did jake has jake tapper i don't
think anybody on cnn has mentioned the
durham
new filing right has anybody seen it
mentioned
at all in any in any concept
any context
business insider
well this would be a good test
so uh tim poole yes newsweek just to
insult trump nothing in new york times
[Music]
yeah
just looking at your comments
new york
post interesting
you know
uh whatever you believed about how much
manipulation there is by the media
did you ever think there was this much
this feels like a whole new level
doesn't it
like every time you think oh they can't
get any worse than this
um
oh so
june is saying if it's not reported on
both sides it's not real
let me
let me
tweak that so that
that's a rule that i've used for a bs
a bs test so the bs test is if one side
says something's true and the other side
says it's not true it's probably not
true
because i usually go with the not true
ones but in this case it's being ignored
it's not being called not true
in that case you have to assume that the
accusation is true
because the other side is not addressing
it and it's such a big one
that if you don't address it that's
saying something so the bs indicator
would say ignoring it
means guilt
but if they said no we looked into it
and it just
you you're looking at it wrong
or you forgot a fact or there's some
context
then i would go with the debunker
actually usually doesn't mean they're
always right it's just a general rule of
thumb
david pakman reports on a completely
different world he does
yeah he and i have talked it's
interesting i think his background is
economics as well so we we can actually
speak productively despite being in
different movies which is weird
all right
it's worse than watergate
you haven't heard of
durham's release about hillary on
saturday morning
i don't
i guess i haven't heard of that i don't
know what you're talking about
um
russiagate was denied was that true
uh there you go with the denier
um oh russia or you mean russia in terms
of it being a fake
thing oh that's true yeah that would be
interesting because
for the russia collusion thing
there were two movies one is that it was
always a
like a hit job and the other was that it
was true
but in both of those there's one saying
it was true and one thing's false so
they kind of cancel each other out
that's a weird one
but trump was right along right that
they were spying on him
distance yourself from the left scott
they are truly evil
undermining all of us for
ever i don't think they're evil i think
that they don't have a good talent stack
that's what i think
i i don't think the left has evil people
in it
uh talonstack meaning if they understood
economics better for example
and and some other
i guess the uh if they understood how
human motivation works
then they might be in better shape
all right
um
evil is banal yeah i don't like to call
things just evil because i think that's
just putting words on stuff
pelosi is not evil
well
i i know it's just too simplistic to
label people as evil i don't think
pelosi wakes up in the morning and says
let me go do some devil stuff
i think she
she has undoubtedly done things that you
and i don't like
it kind of comes with that job
all right
that is all i got for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow i'm pretty sure this is the
best thing you've ever seen in your life
until tomorrow
that's all for now
