good morning everybody
what a great day
well so far
um
i don't know what you say on september
11th uh probably not happy september
11th
but
i'm not going to talk about that too
much because there'll be plenty of that
in the news and you don't need any more
of it
uh i'm sure you're not going to forget
it
but hey is there anybody here who'd like
to
take it up a notch
is there
is there anybody here who wants to have
a really good time well
[Music]
came to the right place and all you need
to take it up a notches a cup or a mug
or a glass of taco tell us to sign a
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day
thing that makes everything better
it's called simultaneous sip
it happens now go
that's some good
stuff now
let me find something here that uh i
should have had ready for you
the moment i logged on
there it is
so i tried
to live stream on the rumble
platform as well i was planning to do
that this morning but
i couldn't make it work i got a some
kind of technical problem i don't know
what to do about it
i don't know how anybody signs up for
rumble i mean i i'm not criticizing it
i'm just curious
why is it that no matter how hard i try
i can't sign on and just use it so
i assume it's just me because i have a
lot of users
so
but it's only the live stream portion
and i think that's might be still in
beta i'm not sure
but you can watch us here on
youtube and locals platform
speaking of the locals platform
subscription service
uh i now have 149
micro lessons up there
so if you're a subscriber you can see
149
roughly two minutes a piece
video lessons and each one is designed
to give you a skill
an actual useful skill
in two minutes
so if you had been a subscriber since
the beginning you would have 149
extra skills
in one year
149
extra skills in one year
now most of you would say oh you know i
don't know if every one of these lessons
applies to me directly but
i think
50 to 100 of them would easily
imagine imagine adding
50 skills
to your uh to your skill stack here i
think it's worth it
anyway cnn fake news i guess joe rogan
is thinking about suing them
because some reporter claimed that he
took quote horse dewormer to treat covet
and as joe rogan would like you to know
what he took came from a doctor
you know people with a medical degree
and all that
he didn't take the horse version
and i'm sure the cnn's viewers
actually think he took you know some
kind of a horse based product and chewed
on it for a while
but no that didn't happen so here's the
question
is it
appropriate
to sue somebody for this kind of
defamation i guess it would be
and i'm generally anti-lawsuit for this
sort of thing so i wouldn't do it
but
it seems like it might be important
you know i i kind of doubt joe rogan
will do it he just doesn't seem like the
you know from the outside looking in he
doesn't look like this kind of guy who
wants to waste his time on lawsuits
i mean what could be less
less good use of your own time
but
he does have an interesting situation in
which his reputation
affects his brand and his brand affects
his income and it could be very
expensive
to have cnn telling people that you're
taking a horse dewormer
that does not build confidence in your
audience
so i feel like he has a case
that doesn't mean you necessarily want
to pursue it
because that's a lifestyle decision but
it looks like he's got a case you know
just sort of on the conceptual level
uh not necessarily on the legal level
um here's a question
if you were single
would you date
during the pandemic somebody who was not
vaccinated
now here in my my question i'm assuming
that you are if you're you know if
you're not vaccinated too you don't care
probably
but
if you're vaccinated would you date
somebody who is not vaccinated
i'm seeing mostly yes's
see
one no
almost all yeses interesting
i think you're wrong you're all wrong
i know you think it's your opinion
you can't be wrong about your own
opinion can you
oh yeah you can
here's the correct answer
it depends how hot the person is
if you're dating somebody who's super
hot
maybe you don't care for the vaccine
you'll take your you'll take your
chances
but let's say if somebody was just
they're about as good as you are
right they're not better than you
they're about the same
same quality of date as you are
well in those cases it might not take as
much to knock me off
off the path
so the correct answer is always
depends how hot that person is
uh it reminds me of one of my favorite
stories from my corporate days i used to
work in a
big company and i worked in the the
technical laboratory
and
big discussion in the laboratory one day
was about the use of one of the drawers
because it was a shared space so you had
to kind of decide you know what was in
each drawer so everybody was happy
and one of the drawers we were trying to
decide if it should be the snack drawer
where you keep all our snacks
or should it be the the extra
screwdriver drawer because you always
needed screwdrivers for you know playing
with your technology
and so i i said to my boss at the time i
said what do you think do you think we
should put the food in there or the
screwdrivers
and my boss looked at me
and in uh
in a mannerism that could only be
compared to buddha
possibly gandhi
he answered the question of should there
be screwdrivers or food in the drawer
this way
he said
well actually the way i asked the
question was the setup
so i went to my boss and said um should
we have screwdrivers or
our food
in other words you'll be should we be
screwing or eating is the way i ask the
question
hey mike do you think we should be
screwing or eating
and mike looked at me and he said
without missing a beat
depends how hungry you are
i'm just going to let that sit there
my old boss who by the way named dilbert
he came up with a name when i was just
thinking about it as a comic
everything you need to
know about human beings
in one statement i said would you rather
screw or eat and he said
depends how hungry i am
that's the whole thing
that's everything
that's everything you need to know about
people
it's done
you could just take that formula and
apply it to everything
and it would explain
everything
all right um
apparently san francisco the school kids
uh are 90
vaccinated
and what do you get when you have 90
percent vaccinated school kids
listen to this
90 of them are vaccinated
and what do they get for that
zero infections
90 are vaccinated
zero infections
zero
do vaccinations work
i know i mean i i don't know how many of
them would they would have had otherwise
but i think some
right feels like there would have been
some
so
i just put that out there
um i buried a lot of people making the
analogy
that the vaccination decision and the
abortion decision are kind of similar
meaning that
who has control over your body
do you have control over your body well
the pro-abortion people will say yes yes
it's your body it's your body and it's
your choice they would say
but why don't they say the same for
vaccinations that's the point that i'm
seeing on social media
why isn't it the same
my body my choice right
well here's my take on that argument
it's ridiculous
they're just different situations every
situation you should look at
uniquely and make a decision uniquely
do we ever tell people what to do with
their bodies
all the time
do you know what civilization is
it's the government telling you what to
do with your body
that's what civilization is
it's the government
telling you what you can and cannot do
with your body
you don't believe me
try walking down the middle of a freeway
during rush hour
just stand in the middle of the lane and
just take a walk during rush hour see
how it turns out
your body
isn't allowed there
it's your body why can't you make your
own decisions about what your body does
nope
civilization doesn't work that way
yeah how about uh if you want to drive
your car without your seatbelt
hey it's your life
nope
you can't drive your car without your
seatbelt
how about uh let's see what else how
about a polio vaccination
let's say you don't want one
can you just say i don't want my polio
vaccination does that work out for you
nope
nope you're gonna have to get one
how about drinking and driving
hey it's your body
right if you want to put alcohol in your
body
and then put your body in a car
and drive your body around in your car
that should be illegal right well it's
not it's not legal
um how about
doing drugs before going to work
can you do a bunch of cocaine and
you know shoot up a bunch of stuff and
then go to work well people do
but if they get caught
probably get fired
probably get fired but why can't you do
a bunch of drugs and go to work it's
your body
it's your body who tells you what you
can do with your body
civilization
civilization
tells you where your damn body can be
and what your damn body can do
period
if you want to do anything you want with
your body you can
but you have to leave
civilization
right now having said that
does it make sense that you say well
if this is how we treat seat belts
this is how we should treat a covenant
vaccination no
no
just look at them all individually
everything's going to be its own
decision
but
decisions by analogy is just crazy
apparently the botched afghanistan
withdrawal was even more botched than we
imagined do you remember that
biden drone attack
on
what we thought was some isis bad people
a planner they said an isis planner
well it wasn't maybe an isis planner i
think the new york times did an
investigation and found out it was less
an isis planner than it was
a citizen who works for some american
entity
basically somebody on our side
and there might not have been any
secondary explosions
or
it's not clear that we could determine
it
so it looks like what we did was drop
bombs on innocent
people and claimed victory
and tried to get away with it
ouch
i don't know that you could fail harder
than the united states failed in
afghanistan i mean just
and you know adding tragedy to tragedy
killing innocents the worst possible
thing
but wow
and as glenn greenwald and others have
pointed out
why is general milley still employed
seriously
nobody got fired for afghanistan
nobody
nobody got fired for that
well
that's fine if you don't want to win in
2020 democrats and you want a republican
president next time
uh cause this to me seems like a big
deal it would be one thing to make a
mistake
and you've heard me say a million times
that you know let's
let's be at least a little realistic
about the fact that even our leaders are
going to make some mistakes
because they don't have perfect
information they got to guess
right unfortunately leaders got to guess
sometimes so they're going to make some
mistakes
but
the afghanistan mistakes you have to
fire somebody for that there has to be
accountability and i just don't know why
billy is still in his job
uh bill maher continues to go after the
the left for their silliness he goes
after the right of course but the the
left as he pointed out is just getting
more ridiculous and and is literally
embarrassing him
so bill maher says he's just literally
embarrassed by the people on his own
side i guess
but the latest weirdness is that there's
uh did you know there's something called
the black national anthem
and apparently at last night's football
game i don't know which one it was
but alicia keys sang lift every voice
and sing
and there was also the regular
national anthem
so now we have the regular national
anthem and then the special black
national anthem
can you think of anything that would be
dumber than that
what would be dumber than that
it's
persuasion-wise
you're persuading the country to be more
divided that's the that's the opposite
of the reason for a national anthem
the whole national anthem idea
is to get everybody on the same side
as soon as you throw in that other
national anthem you've
you've reduced any need for it so let me
say this
either do one national anthem i don't
care what it is
or get rid of it
but don't do two
two is the dumbest solution
one pretty good i like that
none
acceptable
so one or none
national anthem completely acceptable
more than one
more than one
no that's the opposite of a national
anthem
that's a divisive
anthem or something i mean
you know if you're if you're going to
aggressively try to do the opposite of
what you want to happen
don't expect people not to notice
um
new information says that people who
were not fully vaccinated in the spring
anyway
in the summer were more than ten times
more likely to be hospitalized
and die
ten times
ten times more likely to be hospitalized
and died
did you know that
does that
does that fit with what you kind of
think it is
you know whatever it is that you think
is the
the effectiveness of the vaccines
when you hear that does it does it track
with what you generally thought it would
be
no i think
in this case i think you would look at
the obese compared to the obese and the
non-obesity birth of the non-obese it
would still be 10 10 times i think
unless i don't know
now let's take that back i don't think
you would necessarily find that
that to be smoothly
smoothly distributed
you said persuading us to get the
vaccine was unethical
please stop
can you not handle facts
because
it's just
it's just a reporting that well i don't
know if it's a fact
i don't know if the base is a fact but
it's a fact that it's reported in the
news that's a fact
if you can't handle facts
how do you operate
if
if you're accidentally getting
persuaded by
facts
don't you think you should be persuaded
really
i mean if you're persuaded by a fact
that's good right
how is that bad
let's say i told you a fact that you you
checked out and it was actually a fact
and it had the impact of changing your
mind
did i persuade you
facts are not persuasion in in the way
that i view the world a fact is just a
fact and if and if i report them in the
order that they arrive
that's that's not persuasion could it
persuade you yes yes because any
anything that comes across your head
could persuade you
but there's no intention
if you're just talking about facts
there's no intention there
if i wanted to persuade you i wouldn't
use facts
do you get that
if i wanted to persuade you i probably
wouldn't use facts
somebody says you failed yesterday well
that's untrue
that's untrue yesterday when i told you
that it would persuade some people
i did hear from people who were
persuaded
so when you say it didn't work
talk to the people who said they changed
their minds because of it now remember
persuasion doesn't get everybody it's
not supposed to i mean it's not really
designed to do that but persuasion can
get you know five percent on a good day
that's a lot
if you could move five percent of a
crowd in one day
wow that would be like a superpower and
i think i might have i think i might
have moved you know two to five percent
um
the other information we have is this is
kind of good news for me
uh is that the modernity of vaccination
seems to be the good one
by quite a bit actually now they all
seem to be protective
but apparently the modern one just just
totally kicks ass on the other ones
now it's good we didn't know that
well
let me ask this question
do you think we didn't know that earlier
do you think we that somebody
yeah official do you think that somebody
wasn't aware
that the mederno would outperform the
other ones
i think this is like the masked
situation in the early days
i i feel as if we knew this but didn't
want to tell the public
because if you told the public then they
would wait for the good one and there
wouldn't be enough of it
so i think that the i think that the
government
may have lied to you
uh i don't know that so this is not
based on facts
but
it feels to me that if the government
let's put an if on this if the
government knew that modernity was the
best performer
and they had to right
don't you think they've known this for a
while
because all you have to do is study just
look at the antibodies right
whoever has the most antibodies well
that was the best vaccination and
they didn't just start looking at the
antibodies yesterday
right
of course they've known this
isn't this another example where the
government almost certainly lied to you
now i think they lied to you for your
own benefit
and that might even be true
well no i take that back
they didn't lie to you for your own
benefit
they lied to you for the country's
benefit which might have been bad for
you
because suppose you could have you know
pivoted and gotten the moderna instead
of something else if you know that it
was worth doing well that might have
been good for you because you got better
information you got a
more powerful shot
but then there wouldn't be enough
if everybody went out and tried to get
the same one it wouldn't be enough
and then that's bad for the country
so
does your government get a pass if they
lied to you about this
in the comments
in the comments
if you buy the notion that
the government certainly didn't want us
to know one of them was the good one
for the benefit of the whole
are you okay with the government lying
to you if they did it for
good intentions
i see one yes i see a no i say no no no
i see mostly knows
another yes
now and then
no no no no no no
uh
somebody says that's not what's
happening so somebody says i'm
characterizing it wrong
never yeah
i don't know
i might disagree with you
because i feel as though
the government lying to you about the
which vaccinations would be more
effective
and i think that's what happened i'm
going to speculate that that is exactly
what happened because i can't imagine
that you know a long time ago
i'm going to say i'm going to surprise
you
i'm going to say it's unethical
and i approve it
it's unethical completely
completely unethical
and i approve it
there are things
there are situations in which doing an
unethical thing
sometimes is your best plan
and the situation is this it would be
unethical to individuals
because you're denying them knowledge
that could maybe be useful to them so
very unethical to individuals
but
it might be ethical for the nations
if that's even a thing
because it could be the thing that's
best for the average
while it's terrible for some individuals
scott has confirmation bias about
moderna
no i read a study that came out today
if the study doesn't exist
then i probably have you know some kind
of cognitive dissonance or confirmation
bias but i'm just telling you what the
study said is is there another study if
there's another study that says
something else i'll report that too now
the
the caveat on all of this is that
studies are often wrong
and it seems to me that i see i saw ian
martizus and by the way i did a fact
check on this ian
i thought i saw
the uh the antibody test that he did
suggested that the vaccine the
vaccinations were fairly similar in in
terms of antibody production
so that would be different than what
this new study says so
do you trust the study
you know always put a little check mark
next to the
skepticism column
was it double blind i don't know
um
do you think fouchy and gates just want
what's best for you
uh i think gates does
i don't know well fauci's remember fauci
is doing a job he's a politician
he's trying to keep his reputation and
all that so he's got more complicated
motivation
but do i think that bill gates only
wants to do what's good for the country
yep
that's exactly what i think with no
hesitation and no
no ifs or buts
i think bill gates only wants to do
what's good for the world in the country
now
i respect i respect a disagreeing
opinion if you have a different opinion
i respect that
because neither of us know right we'd
have to be in its head we can't do that
but
look at uh you know
follow the money
right
if if gates was only interested in
making money
he would not have the gates foundation
which spends all of his time giving away
his money
so he's clearly not in it for the money
he's in it to give away money literally
anti-money
now is fouchy in it for the money
well i doubt it
but he may have financial interests and
those could make a difference
um
and giving oh power yeah power i suppose
is a motivation i don't see bill gates
uh craving power though
he at least not in any way other than a
functional power so he can do his
charity stuff better
dig deeper in the foundation someone
says
does not prove he's right that's true
it's moronic to blindly trust
billionaires nobody does that is there
anybody who's blindly trusting
billionaires
i don't think that person exists
it's not about money it's about power
not for gates
is i don't think gates has any power
motivation for the
for the pandemic what kind of power is
he going to get from that
um
see
seems you do a bit of mind reading of
gates well here's what i'm trying to do
i'm trying to look at the
things that would influence his mind as
opposed to his mind directly
things that influence your mind would be
profit for example and that's clearly
not a motive
because you can see that he's not acting
in a profit way
about anything at the moment because
he's giving away his money
uh he has a hero complex
he should
in the comments i'm saying
the gates has a hero complex
i hope
so don't you
does does elon musk have a hero complex
i sure hope so
i sure hope so
my god imagine if imagine if they had
all that power
and didn't have an impulse to help
i you want them all to have a hero
complex my god there's nothing i want
more than for bill gates to have a hero
complex
is there anything you want more than
that
yeah
wisdom is more than that well i don't
know what that means
all right i'm just looking at some of
your comments now because it's a slow
news day
uh we of course will be paying respect
to all of our
fallen heroes on 9 11.
um but while i got here let me read to
you
some of the micro lessons that you could
have been listening looking at on
on the locals platform
so here are all the things you can learn
in two minutes little two-minute videos
i have on the locals
platform
beating procrastination
saving your relationship from tds how to
make friends how to learn something
effectively creating assets from nothing
uh
lots of stuff in persuasion on how to
know if you live in a simulation
uh how to build your self-esteem
programming your brain talking to
strangers
uh be careful what you measure measure
uh lots more on persuasion how
hypnotists read body language motivating
employees conflict resolution creating
ideas
there are 149 of these
now
um if you've watched me for
a long time and a number if you have
you may know
that i'm always uncomfortable doing
marketing
because you know i have to sell my books
and calendars and all that stuff and i
never loved that stuff
because my view is you know what a
dilbert book is if you want it you'll
get it
you know i don't i don't want to talk
you into buying a dilbert book
you know what it is
if you like it you'll buy it if you
won't
you won't
but the the micro lessons are different
because i've watched the feedback from
the people who have
absorbed them and
people are changing their lives
i mean people are just reporting amazing
uh results from just what they learned
or how they applied it at work et cetera
and i'm hearing this every day every day
i'm hearing this and so um i would
submit to you
that for uh
seven dollars which is what one month
costs of subscription to locals
or five dollars if you do a yearly
package but you could for one month
seven dollars
you could find out
if you get seven dollars worth of value
if you don't well seven bucks
but there are 149 things that you could
add to your talents
give them a look
if you if you did like five of them
there's no way you're gonna feel the
same
just watch five of them
and see if you feel the same
i don't think you will i think you'll
feel like you learned a lot
all right so that is my
pitch
um and like i say for the entertainment
portion of the things that i make
calendars and books and stuff i don't
pitch them that hard because you know
what you like
you know for in those cases just letting
you know they exist is all you need
but the micro lessons will change your
life
and so i'm going to push a little harder
for that because i think it's good for
you
all right
and that is all
um
that is all i've got for today
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
