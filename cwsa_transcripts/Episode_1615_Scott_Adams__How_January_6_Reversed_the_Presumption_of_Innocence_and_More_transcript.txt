well welcome to the best thing that ever
happened to you
sometimes i call this coffee with scott
adams but today
i'm gonna call it an armed insurrection
yeah
because
i've got arms
and sometimes i protest
and if you have arms
and sometimes you protest
you my friends are an armed insurrection
i'll tell you who else is an armed
insurrection pretty soon
when we get to the news now how would
you like to do something that
oh many of you have heard of it it's
called the simultaneous
sip
and it'll definitely be the best one
you've ever had today
and
join me now
by grabbing your copper mug of glass a
tanker chelsea style and i can teen
jugger flash a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the first simultaneous step of the day
as far as you know it's going to happen
now
go
i don't know about you but i feel my
insurrection
getting stiffened
stiffened i've stiffened my insurrection
well
how many of you have seen the movie
don't look up
have you all seen that a number of
people were saying scott
you should see that movie you don't look
up and i didn't know why
and i didn't realize it was
political in nature
now here's the thing you need to know
about it
now give me your opinions those who have
seen it you love it or hate it
uh
loved it hated it loved it hated it
lived it hated it all right here's my
take out i could definitely see why many
of you would hate it
i can definitely see that because it
targets uh yeah i would say it targets
trump supporters would you say that's
a fair statement did you feel that it
targeted trump supporters or republicans
i felt like it did but here's my take on
it
i i really enjoyed it in fact it's one
of the one of my favorite
movies that i've watched in a long time
in fact it's the only one i've enjoyed
in a long time
and
here's why
unlike you i don't exactly view movies
the same way
meaning that because i write for a
living
if the writing is really good
and you know the acting and everything
i'm totally sold
and if they make fun of me or you know
some group i'm associated with as long
as they do it really well
i love it it's only when it's not done
well for example
when some of you started calling me
started calling me vax adams
my only objection to it was
it wasn't wasn't quite clever enough it
was like all right
but then uh somebody came up with claw
adams
and i was all over that
because that's actually genuinely funny
because a clot is way worse than the
and vaccination
funny because of scott
so
if somebody is really does a really good
job obscuring me
i love it because i just appreciate the
art of it i don't take it any too too
personally but i can totally get
how you would be offended by it and hate
every moment of it
but i i'm just gonna have to say in all
fairness
it was really well executed in my
opinion i thought the writing was
sensational
and i thought the acting
was really really good and the casting
and
the directing
the pace i mean i liked everything about
it so i like the artistry of it uh
a lot
a lot but i i get it if
you know if it's not your thing
all right i don't know if you noticed
that elon musk replied to me
to a tweet in which i noted i will
paraphrase my tweet
but i said i'm not saying that people
who work technical jobs are smarter than
people who work in marketing
i just think you should be noted that
elon musk performs the job of an entire
marketing department
while tweeting as he shits
now that actually
is close to literally true
because he has said that he tweets when
he's on the toilet
which i believe i mean
that doesn't mean every tweet
and it is true that he doesn't have a
marketing department and he does a lot
of his marketing by tweeting
and you want to get really meta
the the fact that he responded to my
tweet about it is marketing
like because he just keeps a
high profile and you know keeps it light
and keeps it funny
and it reminded me
i keep going back to this you saw the
interview of elon musk with the babylon
bee people
and the the thing that sticks in my mind
is that before they interviewed him he
started interviewing them
and the questions he was asking about
how they got started
seemed very much like somebody who was
looking to
start a media empire
now
i don't know if he's ever talked about
it
but doesn't it make sense for everybody
in his position
to have some
some media
asset
and we also heard well i did i was
hearing a
interview in which elon musk was saying
at one point they actually considered or
he did starting a candy company
but they evaluated a bunch of samples
and the reason he didn't is that he
couldn't come up with a candy
that was just way better than other
candy
you know he could he made some that were
good candies and maybe even a little bit
better but unless it could be a way
better candy he didn't didn't really
want to get involved so he let that go
and i thought to myself
what would an elon musk
putting together a media
asset what would that look like if it
had to be
substantially better
than other
media properties
do you think you could do that because
you've got all these media news entities
and they're all kind of the same aren't
they
in a way i mean some lean left some lean
right but they're kind of the same
product
and then you've got the the babylon bees
and the onions and the satire people and
they're really just
pure humor
do you see where the opportunity is and
i'm wondering if trump is going to fill
this space
the opportunity
is something that's genuinely
interesting meaning you learn something
about politics in the world and it makes
you a better citizen at the same time
it's hilarious
now in a way john stewart pioneered that
because we learned after it became a
big phenomenon
that a lot of people in a certain age
group the young were actually getting
their news from john stewart
but he would deliver it in the you know
the humorous way
but before he would do his joke he would
actually have to tell you what the news
was
before he did the joke
and it was
yeah and john oliver now etc
but you don't have anybody who's
actually trying to inform you
you know like a major platform that is
just funny all the time
and when you see it work such as
gutfeld yeah guffeld both on the five
and on his own show gov felt you see
that when real news is combined with
humor
the ratings are great
the rays are great
yeah bill maher
real news and humor so if i were an elon
musk and if i were and this is all
speculative there's no no indication of
this
but if i were thinking of doing it and
if it had to be better than you know
substantially better than other things
there is really an opening
for news that's just not serious ever
but
still gives you the news and maybe even
shows you both sides
ian bremmer
tweeted
on our anniversary today january 6 does
it seem like it's only a year since
january 6.
i'm not the first person to note this
but
i i feel like it was three years ago
like it's sort of mind-blowing that it
was one year ago that january 6
happened so
ian bremer was tweeting today he said
one year later most americans think
another one sex event
is likely i agree
americans increasingly believe political
opponents at home and their principle
enemy are their principle enemy that
they were more targeted at each other
and he said democracies don't persist
for long under those conditions now i i
weighed in and said
the odds of an ameri of an imaginary
insurrection
what would you say are the odds
of another imaginary insurrection
it's a hundred percent because we we're
we're in a world where both sides are
just accusing each other of
insurrections all day long
so the odds of another imaginary one
a hundred percent you know
in a year or whatever
but how many real ones are going to
happen
how many real insurrections are going to
happen in say the next year
probably one or two because that's the
run rate
our run rate is one or two insurrections
a year we just use different language to
describe it
what was the russia collusion
hoax
the russia collusion hoax was
a government overthrow
or you know preemptively depending on
what timing you look at but the whole
point of it was to
change our form of government
through an organized intelligence
led
effort how's that not a coup
or
an insurrection or something
right
i would argue that both the fine people
hoax and the drinking bleach oaks were
organized
probably intelligence was involved in it
and it was
a coup attempt
to make the public so convinced that
something ridiculous had happened that
you had to get rid of the president
right away
i mean to me i think we're in a
continuous coup situation
now am i willing to call the january six
protests
an insurrection
if you if you want to put a a small eye
on it and apply it to maybe
20 deranged people who were there
maybe
but if you're applying it to the whole
crowd
well we're in dangerous territory now
because as i tweeted
something terrible has happened which is
the presumption of innocent innocence
which is the bedrock of
really
civilization
at least at least the civilization we
want to live in
the presumption of innocence got
reversed on january 6.
the president of the united states is
right now
calling them
armed insurrectionists
have the courts decided that there were
any armed insurrectionists there
nope
there were armed people there and they
should you know anybody who broke a law
should be you know punished i don't
think there's anybody listening to this
who would disagree with the
with the statement that people breaking
laws need to be punished blah blah
but
there were a ton of people who didn't
even know they were breaking a law
because the fences were down before they
got there they were just protesting
so if you've got a president
who is
presuming without the benefit of a trial
that the these people were there for
insurrection
you have put the assumption of guilt on
on citizens
from the highest office in the land
the highest office in the land the
president
just put the assumption of guilt
on a bunch of people
some of them were guilty
some some
but most of them not so much
most of them were
trying to do what they thought was
preserving uh
democracy
by postponing the
certification
until some audits can get done
now of course when the fake news reports
about it they act like the idea is that
they would take over and just change the
government
no demand like that ever happened
the only demand was can you give us a
few days to audit some suspicious stuff
that is protecting the the republic
or at least in the minds of the people
there
you know we're not mind readers but the
the asserted public
often stated purpose
was to delay things until there was an
audit
i don't believe anybody there
anybody
actually i think literally there might
not been this is weird to say an
absolute right
when you talk in absolutes you're pretty
much always pretty much always
wrong
but i think it would be an accurate
absolute
to say nobody that was there to destroy
democracy
would you buy that
would you buy that every person who was
there everyone 100
no matter whether they were breaking
laws or not wouldn't you say that 100 of
them
thought many incorrectly
that this was a good way to protect
the democratic process because they
believed that the vote had been rigged
now were they right
i haven't seen evidence of it
i haven't seen evidence i also haven't
seen evidence that they're wrong
because
once again
january 6 reversed
the presumption
of innocence and guilt
it used to be that if there was
something about the government that was
opaque
that we we couldn't see what was going
on
you just assumed it was corruption
am i wrong
if any part of the government was trust
us you know just just trust us except
for you know military secrets and stuff
but if any part of the government was
well we've got this budget
and uh we don't want to give you the
details but you know we're spending this
thing
right the assumption is
is corruption
and now we've gone to the courts
couldn't find the thing we didn't look
for in the election so now we must
presume the the governments
of the states anyway are innocent
we're giving the states the presumption
of innocence
when they're not showing us an auditable
election
that's backwards
the presumption has to be that the
election is corrupt
if he can't audit it that doesn't mean
it is
but like the standard in
in in the law where you assume innocence
until proven guilty that doesn't mean
you're innocent
that just means the system
has to assume innocence it only it can
only work that way
but that's not the government
the government has to prove they're not
guilty
they've got to open the the books
they've got to be transparent they've
got to show you who voted for what
they've got to show you where their
where their donations came from right we
do all of that because the presumption
of guilt
meaning that if the government can hide
anything
we do presume they will
am i wrong is there anybody who would
disagree with the statement that we
require a government to be transparent
because we presume
every one of us
that if it's not transparent there will
be problems
right 100 of us
there there's so few things you can say
are a hundred percent true
so few
this is one of them
anyway
i think that should be the lesson of
january 6 that we lost the most valuable
thing
that our republic has ever
created which is a presumption of
innocence for
um
citizens and and i still have many
questions about the people who are being
held
on charges that
were were very skeptical
that these are not just political
situations very skeptical
can we prove it
nope nope do you know why we can't prove
it
because the government
is not transparent about why these
people are being held
and what their deal is
i presume corruption
because it's not transparent
that is a fair assumption doesn't mean
it's true
doesn't mean it's true
but it's a fair assumption and it's the
only one that makes sense
rasmussen did a poll
and found out that trump is on the
anniversary of january 6. trump is
almost exactly as popular as he was at
the end of his presidency i mean before
the trouble
uh 52
very or somewhat favorable
that's trump today
by contrast black lives matter is 46
very or somewhat favorable
so after everything that's happened
trump is more popular than black lives
matter
i'm not sure that the news reflects that
all the time
um
here's a question
that's uh
self-serving but i think you're gonna
learn something
one of the biggest questions that i'm
getting on social media
lately
is
why i'm uh intentionally destroying my
reputation
any of you wonder about that
or have any of you observed that to be
true
that i'm destroying my reputation by
i guess having different opinions on
some of you about
whatever pandemics
now on on locals it doesn't seem that
way because the subscription service
attracts people who
would like to be challenged by
different ideas
um so you're you're not curious
well you're gonna ruin my whole uh
premise here i thought you'd at least be
curious
why i do it intentionally
all right well i'm gonna tell you anyway
in case you had an idea but it wasn't
exactly what i was thinking
they're like no i'm not we're not
curious
if you are a creative person
success becomes a prison
for example when i created dilbert
i got this great creative let's say uh
benefit you know that it just feels good
to create something that people like
but once dilbert was created i couldn't
really turn him into something else
so every day for 33 years or whatever
i've been doing it
i create a dilbert that's not that
different
from the first one
i try to make new jokes of course
but it's a trap
if i tried to make a second comic what
would happen they'd say that's not as
good as dilber and it wouldn't be
because it would be new
even dilbert wasn't as good as dilbert
until i did it for 10 years and you know
i figured out how to do it so i'm
trapped that i can't change dilbert much
and i'm trapped
that i can't introduce something new
because it will just be compared to
dilbert
so what do you do
the problem is that the dilbert comic
was largely you know liked by a wide
group of people
now one thing i did and some people on
locals know this
on the subscription service
i did a obscene comic
so you've seen some of them and uh on
twitter i don't put them all there
but i have some robots just reading the
news and they
they say horrible things that i couldn't
say in a
normal place
so it's about the horribleness so the
the robots renews and the subscription
service in particular because i can put
things where people are not going to get
upset
that that gave me freedom
that gave me a lot of freedom
but when i do this stuff and especially
when i talked about some pandemic stuff
well let me go back when i first started
talking about politics
i knew
that my whatever popularity i have would
would reduce by about half because
anybody who didn't like what i was
saying about politics would like me less
so whatever dilbert popularity i had
would decrease by half
i did that intentionally
because as a creator and here's here's
the payoff
creation and destruction
are basically the same thing
i mean not exactly but you can't
separate them
in order to create you have to destroy
you know you got to take down a house to
build a new one you got to destroy who
you are to be a new you you've got to
destroy what you were doing to do
something new almost
yeah almost invariably you have to
destroy something to be free and so part
of what you see me doing is fighting for
my freedom
creative freedom
and the creative freedom requires many
of you to hate me
and i'm going to do it anyway
because
i'm not going to stay in a creative box
at this point in my life you know i just
it's intolerable i want to do where
where
where i think i can help where i can
make a difference where i could do
something maybe better than other people
are doing it but i don't want to be
locked in some some little world and so
i'm going to describe this better by
talking about three things the three-mat
three-act movie structure
i talked about creative prisons and then
i'm gonna give you a new filter that i
call the really filter
and the really filter goes like this
you describe something
to find out if it's real
and you do it sarcastically with the
word really
i'll talk about that moment
all right
so
uh
so here's how the really filter works
uh let me give some examples let's say
if i said to you that bob went to the
store
totally normal thing hey bob went to the
store
could you turn that into something
sarcastic by adding really
you couldn't i'll try watch oh really
really
bob went to the store
seriously
of all the things that bob can do
you tell me bob went to the store
you see how that doesn't work
because you're thinking that's just
normal bob went to the store why are you
adding
that attitude to it
right so that's an example of the filter
detecting something that's probably true
probably bob just went to the store
right
but if you find something that's
absolutely not true
watch what happens
okay here's another one
uh the president's uh suggested that you
should drink bleach maybe to help with
your covert
really
really
a person who built a meet an empire
ran for president destroyed the field
accomplished
many things according to his supporters
anyway
did all of these things speaks in public
continually
has a college education
and really
really you think that he stood in front
of the public
you really think this
and suggested
for real
that he said to drink bleach
really
really see that
there's somebody on youtube who still
thinks he really did that
um we're way past did he really do it
that's been fact checked to death no he
didn't really do that
there's if you believe it that's part of
the
mass formation psychosis or some damn
thing let me do another one
uh the president of the united states
stood in front of the world and called
neo-nazis fine people
really really
every single person in the world
knows that that would be a bad idea if
you were a politician
but the only person
the only person in the world really
that couldn't figure out not to do that
was the one who is president really
really that happened
and of course it didn't happen
some of you on youtube don't know it
because you think it really did happen
no it didn't happen it was a fake edit
just like the just like the bleach hoax
thing is a fake edit
yeah yeah you really saw it no you
didn't
you all saw the fake edits and you saw
it a lot of times
so if you find the real lattice you'll
realize that both of those real but
here's the shortcut did you need to do
all the work of finding the fake edit
and find out what they took out of
context
no you could have used the real e filter
here's another one
the events of january 6
were an insurrection
tried the really filter on it
the events of january 6 were an
insurrection
go ahead
how does that work
really
really the guy with the buffalo horns
and the dude with the zip ties
were going to conquer and hold the
government of the united states really
that was their actual plan
they looked around and they said hey i
think several of us are armed
let's go into the capitol
maybe take some
hostages i do think that part was
probably real
and we we have a pretty good idea
that this will create something that
will let us hold the country
and and rule over it
with our uh whatever our god king trump
or something
really you really think
that there's some people thought that
they could conquer the government of the
united states with their flag poles
and their bear spray
really you really think that see
now did that work
that worked didn't it
so
i'm not going to say this filter works
every time
but it works pretty well you want want
to do another one
uh there was a uh story about me years
ago
uh that you'll still see if you google
me like comes up all the time
and it was long before we learned that
all the news is fake
like we know now
this was back when you thought some of
the news was probably real
now i'm going to tell you what the story
is about me
and i want you to apply the really
filter okay
you've probably even heard this about me
you about you even thought this was true
i bet a lot of you thought this was true
so here's what was said about me
that i wrote a blog post in which i
compared women
to children and the mentally disabled
so that's that's the story about me that
i wrote a blog post in which i compared
women to children and the mentally
disabled
really
really
i i'm somebody who lives in the media
for a job
i'm media trained
i have a college education i do this for
a living
and you really think that i wrote i
wrote that
really
you really think that i thought it would
be a good idea
to compare women to children and the
mentally disabled
and that i didn't see that maybe that
would cause trouble
really
do you really think i did that
and the answer is of course i didn't do
that
of course not
now if you don't know the story i'll
tell you what i did do
in in the context of mocking men
that's the part they leave out
it was mocking men that was the whole
context
i said that men were cowardly
essentially i'm paraphrasing that men
were cowardly and they're
and that they they don't tell women the
truth
so that was the point
now is it offensive to say that men
are afraid of telling women the truth
no that's just an observation it doesn't
even say anything about women well i
guess it does but it's more about men
right
and in order to make a what i thought
was a hilarious point there was that
point
i thought to myself wouldn't it be funny
if i if i got everybody riled up
by putting three things at a list that
don't belong
and so i consciously formed the sentence
in which i said i forget the exact
sentence but it's something like
there are three groups that men don't
argue with
and i said uh
children mentally and anticopt and women
now the reason that i put them in the
list
is that you're supposed to say wait what
did you just put women in the list with
children and the mentally disabled
and you were supposed to say
my god that that feels wrong
because it was designed to feel wrong
that's why i wrote it you were supposed
to say wait a minute my brain is
breaking okay i get your point
your point is these are three things
that men
don't argue with but for different
reasons right
the the reason you don't argue with
those three groups isn't the same reason
it's not because women are mentally
disabled it's not because women have you
know undeveloped brains there is three
different reasons right
but by putting him in a list
i was aware that it would make people's
heads explode and they would think
momentarily wait a minute did he just
compare them
but then they would read it again like
okay he's just being a jerk and he
thinks that's funny which is what i was
doing it was just being a jerk and i
thought it was funny
now
when you hear that in the context of
2022
do you believe me
if you heard this in the context of when
it was sad or when this happened
everybody still thought that what they
read was true
like people widely believed
that i'd made this like a serious
comment
uh thank you
eric anyway so use the the really uh and
by the way the really filter is a
variant on
the scott alexander theory
that if something sounds too incredible
to be true
it's because it always is
not always but like 98 of the time if
you hear something that's just a head
shaker oh i can't believe that
there's a good chance it didn't happen
that's all you need to know just go
really did that happen
all right here's the other thing you
need to know i'm going to pull this all
together in a minute
i've talked about this how our minds are
oriented towards stories you all know
that right
the human brain can be influenced by
stories and programmed by stories and
narratives if you like
but we're also influenced by the
three-act
um
three-act movie structure
now the three-act movie structure is the
first act something happens that changes
people's lives you know somebody dies or
takes over or there's a war or whatever
act two is the fun and games
area where everybody's just acting out
the thing that's happened you know
they're struggling through something but
generally it there's not that much
problem
until you get to the third act in which
case the hero is doomed and doomed
forever
in an unsolvable problem and then at the
end the problem gets solved
so our brains are just built to imagine
that's going to happen let me give you
an example
when i
left my cartooning sort of field and
started talking about trump
trump was the first act when he first
came on the scene
and then i wrote a blog post called
clown genius in which i reframed him as
more clever than you think because he
has this skill set and persuasion
i think that actually made a difference
in getting him elected by the way
because until then he was widely thought
to be a clown
and i explained that the clowning has
utility which he proved by the way and
he actually said i'm doing this for a
purpose
and he absorbed all the energy in one
just like i predicted but act one was
that trump
gets into the race and then in terms of
my movie
my reputation got destroyed
because i was the person saying he was
gonna get all the way through and get
elected
and so i was just destroyed
i used to be the good the good dilbert
cartoonist
and then half the world said
you are really dumb
and then another half of the half the
republican said
okay i see what you're saying but
there's no way he's going to become
president
so i made 75 percent of the world think
i was
stupid
you know my reputation was in the toilet
and the third act
for me
and and for the trump story as well
was before election when the news came
out the or the recording of him saying
that he sometimes grabbed women by the
you know what
so here was the setup first act trump
changes things i become part of that by
writing about him
second act is all this fun and games i
write about what he's doing is
linguistic kill shots it's fun and games
it's the campaign and then just before
the election
third act
it's over
nobody gets elected
with that big of a thing hanging over
them right before the election
and then
he got elected anyway
he got elected anyway and that was the
like the surprise result the end of the
movie
now
uh is this the first time i've been
involved in a three-act play well no
no
not
um
for example
back in the 90s i predicted that
evolution would be debunked
in my lifetime
by scientific means not by religious
means
do you know what happened in the 90s
when i when i predicted that evolution
would be debunked
i destroyed my reputation
because most of my uh
my customer base were technical or at
least you know educated people who would
uh say no scott if you're selling me
this uh
this
intelligent design
which i wasn't
at the time i just said i don't know
what the answer will be
i don't think it will be a god answer
but i think the evolution will be
debunked i got savaged by that and
anywhere i went to do to talk about
anything for about 20 years
everywhere i went somebody said don't
listen to him he's a guy who thinks
evolution isn't real
and then the simulation theory came out
as i predicted
a complete different way of looking at
reality which is specifically what i
predicted i predicted the evolution
would be replaced
because we would see reality itself
differently and that would just be a
subset of reality
and now the simulation theory
which has lots of backing from smart
people elon musk again uh actually
rewrites the entire idea of what
evolution would even mean if we're if
we're a simulation
and so
we've come full circle
writing my book and calling evolution a
mistake
20 years of eating for it
followed by
can you believe it there is a competing
theory called the simulation there's
probably a trillion to one more likely
than evolution we don't know
but it's probably a trillion one more
likely just because there will be lots
of simulations
and we know that so the odds that they
you're in the original one are pretty
low
right so that was another one that was
sort of a three-act play
and we're right in the middle of another
one
in which i
made some statements about rogue doctors
usually being wrong
and made a lot of other
uh statements about the pandemic and the
virus and vaccinations
caused
because the few people who still
still had any respect for me
to lose it
mostly they imagined i had opinions that
i didn't have but we'll get to that
uh but the the net of it was that
something happened the pandemic
that was the thing that happened that's
the first act the second act was all of
us you know dealing with it and making
predictions and you know et cetera and
then the third act is whatever is the
conclusion
in which we figure out who was right
about everything and who is wrong
my
my third act my impossible feat
is to recover
from not only everybody on the left
hating me because
i talk about things on the right
but also a huge portion of the right
hating me because they believe i
disagree with them on vaccinations and
stuff and i probably don't
so how do you get out of that
this ladies and gentlemen
is where we're at we're at the third act
can i do it
is there any way that i can defend
myself from
what people have said is scott losing it
that in fact my
flailing at my critics is proving
how crazy i am how possibly lost in a
mass formation psychosis
and that
there is no way having predicted so many
things wrong and gotten so many things
wrong in the pandemic and everybody
knows it
how wrong i've been about really
everything in the pandemic there is no
way to recover
from this third act
is there
well
here's a little update
i put together my list of my predictions
that i could remember which of course
includes none of them that i got wrong
because
the way memory works is you remember
your good ones and you forget the bad
ones so i put it on the locals platform
the subscription platform and i asked
the people who follow me the closest to
fact check it and to add onto it in the
comments
uh those
the anything i got wrong that i just
didn't have on the list
so fairly soon i'm going to have a list
of my predictions along with what the
people who follow me
have added to it or corrected it
and then i'm going to make the case that
i had the best predictions in the
pandemic
and then i'm going to find somebody to
publish it
and then
you're going to have to argue whether
about whether i had the best
predictions of the whole pandemic of the
entire world
or maybe just top ten
and when you're done i will have created
a record of predicting
better than anybody predicted
and that
is the end of the movie
and we'll need a new movie after this
because there's always a new movie
but
do i destroy my reputation intentionally
yes
do you think that i act exactly like
this in person
no
how often if you've seen me go into uh
cursing
tirades i mean i don't do that much in
person
but here it comes easily
and i wouldn't say that i'm putting on
an act per se
because my argument is that everybody
modifies their communication for the
situation
you don't talk to a two-year-old the way
you talk to an adult the way you talk to
your boss
the way you talk to anybody else
and so when i talk to you here
this is completely genuine in the sense
that this is my
genuine communication style for this
situation
but of course if i'm negotiating with a
terrorist
i'm going to modify my style
that everybody does in every situation
all right
um
i don't know if any of this was
interesting because the problem is it's
too uh self-referential but i would like
to get back to january 6
and tell you that you are in the middle
of a massive
brainwashing operation
i don't know the degree to which it is
organized but it looks organized
it looks as if the whole january 6th
thing is just to keep trump out of
office and to keep trump's supporters
and republicans in general
demonized
by keeping that story in your head
because it creates a situation where
democrats can do anything to republicans
because damn it those republicans
deserve it look at them and their
insurrections
on election tampering i don't have any
updates on anything about that
all right
uh
it was less somebody says january 6 was
less dangerous than the travis scott
concert
literally true
um
all right
what act is trump currently in good
question
if if i had to put money on it
i would say his best play would be to
start a media empire
and to use his clout there because he
could practically run the country from a
media empire
right
he doesn't have to do all the work and
go to the meetings he he can just do his
thing
and change public opinion and
then things start going his way
prevent election tampering in 2022 can't
be done
can't be done there's there's no energy
on the left or the right to make our
elections
transparent
and when elections are not transparent
meaning that you can't fully audit them
including the electronic parts if it's
not fully transparent
the assumption is corruption
am i wrong
but is there anybody who disagrees with
that by the way
that the assumption should be corruption
because not only is it not auditable
there's no energy to fix it when it's
the biggest problem in the country if
the biggest problem in the country is
not being fixed or even addressed
assume corruption
when the fda was tardy
approving rapid tests
and we we're not quite sure why
i mean we've heard stories but they
don't quite sell
assume corruption
because you can't tell what happened
and they won't tell us exactly
so we assume corruption yeah
um
twitter is run by a mega
hater is that what you're saying
getter is
uh bitcoin crashed
because kazakhstan had an internet
shutdown what
um
somebody's saying that marjorie taylor
green
was on tim cast last night
and this user says i never saw her not
ugly filtered by fake news before so
you're saying that in person she's
a more attractive person than
than the pictures i i love when the uh
fox news does this really well but cnn
does it too
when they're they're doing a negative
story about somebody they don't like and
the photo that they choose is always
just a
yeah the the most insulting photo of a
person
whatever people would uh write stories
about me that were negative they would
go to this piece of
some kind of public
photograph
somehow they would get the rights and
they had always picked the same one
it was one where i was literally acting
like i was
talking while they took the picture i
was i was literally going blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah you know not even
talking and one of the pictures just
makes me look like a real jerk i'm like
like this
and
whenever there's a negative
like a hit piece on me they always go
right to it because it's the one that
makes me look the most ridiculous
and i it's actually so funny that it
makes me laugh
when i see it
uh
when can we get more micro lessons you
know my biggest problem is that i've got
some noisy home construction so i can't
do it in the hours that i want to do it
but i've got i've got a couple lined up
so
yeah this was one today
and uh
we will talk to you
tomorrow
and uh
i think it's fair to say this is the
the best one ever
uh in a very small way the only one i
think is useful is noting that the
presumption of innocence has been
reversed and that's a really big deal
and i don't see anybody talking about it
so i will talk to you
tomorrow
