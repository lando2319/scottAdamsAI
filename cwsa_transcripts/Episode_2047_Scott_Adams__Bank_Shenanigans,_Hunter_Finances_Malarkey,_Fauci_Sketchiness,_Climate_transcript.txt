do do
do do do do do do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a fight in time if you'd like
to enjoy it in the way that people like
you enjoy things all you do is a little
extra and all that extra is that cover
mugger a glass of Tankard Chelsea style
and a Kim tea jug or flaska vessel of
any kind you'd fill that vessel with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
and don't you wish I talked this fast
for the rest of the podcast because
sometimes when I talk some people say
it's not fast enough but if I talk
faster it'd be like this sip
yeah that's good
well we're going to start with the
important stories first and then get to
the nonsense important story first
a zebra attacked a man in Ohio
bit his arm
police were called and police put down
the zebra
you might think it's a race crime
but zebras are almost perfectly striped
white and black
so it's a little ambiguous whether
that's a race Grime or not but so the
zebra was killed by the police and they
speculated that the zebra was being
aggressive
because it was protecting some of the
other female zebras
and this raises a big question
how many zebras are there in Ohio
because apparently it was at somebody's
home
how many zebras did that one person have
makes you wonder what is the maximum
number of zebras you could have
in Ohio and how many of the zebras
died from toxic water from a train wreck
these are many questions that are not
answered to this story
but
in maybe related news I don't know this
is on Fox News a moose attacked a
snowmobiler in Idaho
uh the snowmobiler lived
and
I'm starting to think it's connected
do you think the animals are just pissed
they've had enough
I feel like it's a yeah it's an uprising
this feels like an Insurrection if I use
that word
it's like January 6 all over again
I think it's some kind of a takeover
attempt now if the animals do organize
and here I'm assuming that they'll bring
in their allies the fish and the birds
the animals will have not only Ground
Forces
but a navy and an Air Force
yeah so I'm a little worried about the
animals organizing with any luck AI will
form a robot army and destroy all the
animals
so I mean it might be a fair fight
um
let me suggest a following theme that
you're going to see more of in the
future
art that is supported by advertising is
corrupt
that's my statement art of any kind of
art whether it's writing or Comics or
even music if you depend on advertisers
it's corrupt art
and corrupt by corrupt I mean it's not
the artist's idea of what they should be
it's the artist's best attempt to stay
within the narrow lines
so I believe that if you're watching
advertisers supported art of any kind is
corrupt I mean it might still be
entertaining
but is corrupt in the sense that it's
not art
it's it's just Commerce because it's got
paid between the narrow lines of what's
available now art is supposed to
challenge you
not always I mean some art can be you
know benign but one of the greatest
values of art is shocking you
you know moving you to where you're not
stretching your ideas of things nobody's
going to do that in an Advertiser
supported world because you'll be
canceled but in the subscription world
people are there because they want to be
there so Dilbert being moved from
newspapers which are Advertiser
supported mostly
to a world on the the locals platform
where I can do what I want I have to
tell you the creative freedom that I'm
feeling is the best feeling I've had
actually ever creatively because even
when I began in the early days of the
comic I was always thinking uh-oh I
can't go too far because the comics have
to be for everybody it's for children
and adults and everything
so
I was always self-censoring and then you
know by the time I got canceled they
were censoring me
but now on locals the only thing that
censors me is my own sense of what
people would want to enjoy as art
that's that's my only limit I say to
myself would you enjoy this
does this look like something you laugh
at
and that is good yeah so I you know I'm
not going to go crazy and do a bunch of
like bathroom humor isn't it's not going
to be like that it's just that I can do
it you know if something was unusually
funny I might say well I don't usually
do that but I can't I can add a fourth
panel I can change I could edit it after
it's published I can publish it and then
edit it and change it I could do two
Comics I mean the freedom is insane it's
just the best feeling so thanks to all
the anybody who signed up for the
subscription site uh I appreciate it
immensely well here's another important
story I I guess British jails have
female guards for the male prisons did
you know that do we do that in America
do we have female prison guards in all
Mill
we do
does that sound like the worst idea in
the world
all right here's what's happening in
Gray Britain
now this is this is correlated to my
theory that over time the only people
who will be shoe salesmen are men with a
foot fetish
because the free market should
make it so that people were getting an
extra benefit from working that job
would take a lower salary to do it
because they get the extra benefit of
the excitement so I always think that if
you wait long enough
all shoe salesmen will have foot
fetishes because they're the ones who
would work for the least amount of money
and still do the best job
but apparently if you hire women for
an all-male jail
it turns out that at least in Great
Britain
they're not all there for the right
reason
[Laughter]
so apparently the female guards have
been banging the prisoners like crazy
and since since 2019 a total of 31 women
across England and Wales have been fired
from jails for intimate relationships
with inmates now that's the ones who got
caught
that's just the ones who got caught
now how many female guards are there in
Great Britain and Wales I mean I don't
know what the total population is but
this is just the ones who got caught
I would think that over time the only
female guards you would have working in
prisons are ones that are there because
they want to bang the bang the prisoners
like have a boyfriend who can't uh you
want a boyfriend who probably won't
cheat on you but even they probably do
too
so anyway
uh
I don't know I don't think anybody got
hurt by any of these so-called crimes
sounds like they all had a good time but
you don't want those prisoners to be too
happy
then you know they'll be doing crimes
just to get into jail
imagine being a prisoner
and you're dating your guard
I mean
I I don't know if you've ever had that
fantasy but
it's probably somebody's fantasy all
right let's talk about UFOs he had
another
military pilot
is yet again saying that he and his
other pilot friends have seen
unidentified objects
he encourages us not to think of them as
necessarily alien but unexplained and he
says two aircraft from my Squadron this
is on Fox News sites two aircraft from
my Squadron were flying side by side and
one of these objects went right between
their aircraft he added
it looked like a a dark Cube inside of a
plastic bubble or a clear sphere now
what do you say look like a dark gray or
Black Cube inside a clear sphere
do you think the Unexplained object
was engineered and designed such that
it's a
dark gray or Black Cube inside a clear
sphere
what are the idea what are the odds
that even an alien or Advanced
civilization created it to look like
a some kind of a cube inside a clear
sphere
does any of this sound real to you
now I don't know what is happening
especially when there are multiple
multiple Witnesses I don't know what's
happening but I don't think that they're
seeing
Advanced alien crafts or Advanced crafts
I don't know what it is
but it seems like the least likely
explanation is advanced technology
that feels like the least likely
explanation how about you would you
would you say that these sightings would
suggest not that they're UFOs or aliens
not that they're aliens but it could be
some
you know Earth made technology that
we're not aware of does anybody think
it's like real
as in there's a real thing up there that
we need to know about
yeah I don't think it's real
it has it has all the Tells for not
being real really all of them as every
tell for not being real the the part
that's convincing
is that there are credible people more
than one in many cases more than one
seeing the same phenomenon and
describing it the same
what would that tell you about the
credibility so it's on instruments they
have it's on instruments so they know
there's something there and humans see
it too
that that isn't even a little bit
convincing to me in the real world that
isn't even a little bit convincing I
don't rule it out
all right so if we find out there's
something up there in the future
I'll say well I'm I'm uh let's say I
didn't think it was true but I wouldn't
rule it out I put it in the 10 range
maybe 10 likely there's something up
there in this real that we care about
all right did anybody see uh RFK Jr
talking about Dr fauci and I I saw some
accusations that I've not seen in the
regular news
but it's the most disturbing thing I've
ever seen in my life have you heard the
latest RFK now I'm not sure I have all
the details but it's something like
roughly speaking so but don't don't hold
me to the details roughly speaking fauci
took a sometime in the past took a huge
raise to help the military develop
uh
some kind of game of function viruses
and that he had several places he was
funding in the United States to do it
bio weapons I guess
and that when the heat was put on him
he moved some of it to Wuhan to get it
out of the U.S is that even possible
did is there a clear signal that he took
a gigantic raise made a lot of money
did something in the United States that
we had to chase out of the country and
then he kept doing it in Wuhan and then
when he got caught
and then when he got caught he said none
of it happened
did that really happen
because here's what's what's wrong it's
not in the news
it's not in the regular news even on Fox
News is it
so why is it not even on Fox News
because RFK Jr is pretty credible at
this point wouldn't you say
I I don't think he'd make stuff up
so what's going on here
did I don't know what's going on
is it this is like a
two things that can't be true at the
same time it can't be true that RFK
Juniors making that up
but it can't be true that it's true
because it would be in the regular news
it'd be like the biggest story so what's
going on
does anybody have any idea it's in his
book
so that's in his book which means it's
probably documented and researched and
it's just not in the news
what's going on
I don't know I guess I'm just going to
leave it as a I have no idea what is
happening here I don't know if the news
is gathered around suppressing the story
or maybe the way the story is told is
has got an element in it that's you know
the regular news doesn't think is quite
true
I can't tell
all right well that's disturbing here's
a story you were waiting for a hunter's
uh Financial transactions are going to
be looked at apparently the house
oversight committee has been trying to
get Hunter Biden's Finance banking
records because there's stuff in the
laptop that suggests some sketchy
transactions and I guess the uh whoever
it was in the Biden Administration was
stalling of course and but it looks like
they're finally going to get it because
they
they turned up the heat and they said
they were going to bring in the people
who were stalling and and questioned
them under
uh under oath which freed it up so now
we're going to see something about the
allegations
um that the Biden Associates received a
three million dollar wire from a Chinese
Energy company two months after Joe
Biden left the vice presidency blah blah
blah soon after hundreds of thousands of
dollars in payouts went to members of
the Biden family so that's an accusation
and you know it's an allegation
so let's just say that's an allegation
and not a fact
yet I mean it's not an established fact
but it might be but it's an allegation
um
and I think we're going to actually find
out
what do you what do you think
do you do you think we're actually going
to find out what Hunter Biden actually
did before the next presidential
election
it doesn't it doesn't feel like it does
it it feels like it's going to be more
of Nothing Even though every part of it
looks like it should be something and
something big so here's the funniest
part of the story
uh I I don't know if it's still there
but the way Fox News covered this I'm
talking about Fox's coverage of course
it's not on CNN
in case you wondered yeah it's not
covered on CNN
a gigantic potential story I don't even
think it's mentioned
you can check for yourself but I think
it's not mentioned this seems like
really really big Bear's the best part
of the story
the best part of the story is that
whoever does the headlines for Fox News
they they captured the story the walls
are closing in
now that's funny
that is funny whoever does the little
captions that are over the stories
obviously tongue and Jake and I believe
that they're obvi you know making a
reference to the walls are always
closing in on Trump but hunter Biden is
is the rights Trump
like the the left are like oh we got
Trump now we got his taxes what there's
nothing in the taxes all right well we
I'm sure we haven't with Stormy Daniels
what it's such a small crime that nobody
even cares what let's try something else
and you know we're they're just waiting
for Trump to go down the walls are
closed again but I feel like that's
exactly what the the right is feeling
about Hunter oh we got his laptop he's
going down now
okay he didn't go down because of laptop
but once we get these Financial records
once we get these the walls are closing
in
I feel like I would bet against it
wouldn't you
now I'm not saying that Hunter did
nothing sketchy I'm saying that whether
he did something completely illegally or
not or anything in the gray area that
nothing's going to change
I don't know why I mean other than you
know political connections but there
will be some reason why it doesn't
matter
am I wrong you could predict this so
easily that's why that comment the walls
are closed again I just thought that was
hilarious so kudos
to whoever is the editor who put that on
that page that was funny
right as I saw in the comments we're
talking about a mass Awakening
people becoming more aware of the actual
World they live in in a way that we've
never experienced before and boy is that
going to accelerate
you think you've seen some stuff now
the stuff that's right ahead of us
kind of really be disturbing maybe in a
good way I don't know we're going to
wake up to the reality but just to take
a stroll suit through some of the things
that have changed lately
in my opinion the introduction of
simulation Theory the idea that we're a
simulation and even having somebody like
Elon Musk endorse it as a legitimate
View and I certainly do it's my
preferred view of reality
that's that's sort of a big mind effort
isn't it
but that's just one thing there's a
bunch of things happening let me take a
little little tour through them
I think that we're more aware than we
ever have been
that reality is a subjective experience
would you agree
it's never been more obvious and I think
the yeah the bubbles and the news is
different on the left and the right just
make that so clear in a way that maybe
20 years ago was less clear
20 years ago if somebody said reality
was subjective you'd laugh at them
you would you'd say well come on reality
is reality
um
but
let me turn off my phone
so I think in today's world people see
that the news is is the news is creating
our realities wouldn't you say that
that's obvious and true now in a way
that 20 years ago it was not
because if 20 years ago the news was all
sort of the same generic news I think
people thought it was generally just
True News but now that you see our
opinions are entirely assigned to us by
the news it's hard to miss so not
everybody sees it yet you can see people
waking up to it then we've got AI gpt4
will be coming online and gpt4
I don't want to say it's going to change
everything
but it sure looks like it
like what whatever you think gpt3 was
forget it
I'm pretty sure the gpt4 is not going to
look like gpt3 like it's going to be you
know just a leap I think based on early
descriptions
so that's going to make you even
question the the specialness of
consciousness
Consciousness and the and the special
you know human identity it's all in play
now
the whole idea that we have this special
thing called Consciousness is going to
go right out the window as soon as the
machine has one I would argue that it
has a proto-consciousness so it's not
there yet but maybe GT gpt4 and if it's
not four maybe five
but we're going to see it it's going to
be in your lifetime for sure
so what happens when machines do have
something that the experts say is
consciousness
it's going to change your whole belief
about reality or it could for some
people how about the fact that we have
learned we as a society have learned
that all of our experts are empty
they'll all of our data is manipulated
that all of our news is narrative
that our polls can be dependent on
sometimes but we don't know when
sometimes they're right on but we don't
know when and if they disagree we don't
know which ones are the good ones
so our whole sense of what you could
know and and be confident about is
completely in play right now it looks
like nothing is believable
we don't believe experts data anything
and maybe that's more accurate
remember it was uh not too long ago when
um you would quote Ben Shapiro saying
that facts don't care about your
feelings
how's that how's that sit with you today
the facts don't care about your feelings
sorry it's your feelings don't care
about your facts
there's nothing in the news or even
science at the moment that would suggest
a facts even matter
it's like facts don't even matter
the feelings are the only thing that
matters and it's not the other side
that the moment you think on the other
side is using feelings but we're using
our facts
yeah we're using facts but they're using
their feelings do you know what the
other side says about you
exactly the same thing
oh we're using our facts but they're
using their feelings and their racism or
whatever they're using right once you
realize it's both it's both sides
you're a little bit closer to the truth
there's not one side has the facts and
one side has feelings nothing like that
has ever existed it's all feelings all
the way down and always has been
but more people are realizing that how
about uh do you remember when we thought
we could predict the future
with our climate models and our our
economic models
we can't predict the future
we can't predict tomorrow we can
basically predict nothing
we're very very bad at predicting and
we're coming to that realization that
your financial expert doesn't know where
the market is going
your pandemic experts don't know what
the hell is going to happen with the
pandemic or at least you can't tell
which ones do and which ones don't
um and climate models are probably
ridiculous they're useful
models could be useful even when they're
ridiculous so they're not they're not
empty of utility they're just not really
predicting the future
all right
so in that uh
in that vein
do you think the truth is even good for
us
do you think if humans could just see
the truth
your ears here's all the truth
no we would be totally effed if we saw
the truth all the time
imagination and optimism and
hallucinations are what Hold Us Together
if it were not for the shared
hallucinations and you know feelings
that hold us together everything would
fall apart now some of that shared
Hallucination is under attack because
we're having our our ideas of what was
real and what wasn't
you know being challenged which makes
people Retreat to maybe a different set
of hallucinations not to the truth
we don't retreat to the truth we're not
that kind of creature we Retreat to a
different hallucination will the
different hallucinations keep Society
together
because the the uh feelings that we've
had about let's say being an American
for you know decades and decades the
feeling that you got about being
American was not reality
it was a Feeling
and we had been you know brainwashed in
a good way to have positive feelings but
now we're being sort of accidentally
brainwashed or not
to have less good feelings about the
country
will that cause the country to
disintegrate it could
but keep in mind the facts will always
be a secondary consideration to how we
feel about the stuff the economy is
entirely about how you feel a bank run
whether it happens or doesn't happen is
about how you feel it's not about the
facts
so we're kind of slowly getting to the
point where the only thing that matters
is your subjective opinion even though
there is a base of something like fact
that science and finance can find if it
looks hard enough
but I think we're being a little more
let's say aware of our irrational nature
that doesn't change
yeah
uh here's an example uh Rasmussen has
poll and asked I guess Vivek ramaswami
has been speaking of climate change as a
religion sort of a narrative point he's
making but I was surprised how many
people agreed with that so according to
Rasmussen 60 of likely U.S voters so
that would include you know all the
parties uh including 47 percent who
strongly agree with Vivek ramaswami's
recent statement that climate change has
become a religion now no surprise it's
79 of Republicans and 45 percent of
Democrats what
what
45 percent of Democrats agree with a
republican who says that climate change
is a religion
45 percent
well then I guess the tiebreaker would
be the independence right
um so what did The Independents say uh
60 percent of unaffiliated Voters agree
with it
60 percent
you've got a solid American majority who
thinks that climate change
is
I didn't know it was that strong I
thought it was going to line up a little
bit more directly by party I had no idea
that Democrats are on board and I I
think here's my guess
I think the way the green people treated
nuclear power
was the tell
that it wasn't real
and I think that 45 percent of Democrats
are the Smart Ones
if I may say the Smart Ones always knew
that there was something wrong with the
discussion of nuclear power because they
do the France had nuclear energy and it
was working fine
right 45 percent of Democrats were smart
enough to know that nuclear energy was
solving the problem in other countries
and that we just weren't doing it for
political reasons mostly that's pretty
good
that actually I find that encouraging
because we're not actually that far
apart on a question of major importance
so you could argue well that's why we
have a republic
it's a good thing we have a republic so
that these smart politicians we elect
can do things that may be the public
would not have known to do maybe the
public is too backwards to do the things
it needs to do that's why you have a
republic
except we no longer believe that we live
in that world where well-meaning people
do things just for us
well it's a good thing we elected those
well-meaning politicians to act on our
behalf nobody thinks that that's like an
old illusion everybody thinks the
politicians are
serving their parties serving
re-election getting money you know it's
all those things
so
um I I have to compliment
the Democrats 45 percent of them saw
through the propaganda
that's pretty good if you could give 45
of any population to see through intense
non-stop propaganda
that's pretty good on your part I'm
going to say that's a compliment to the
Democrats
somebody says I'm wrong
what is it for the oh I'm not saying
that uh I'm saying that the Rasmus and
Paul says 45 percent of Democrats agree
that climate change is a religion
meaning that's there's some irrational
components driving
all right
um
more to that point there's an article in
the Atlantic by Shadi Hamid that the
truth can make you sick
and that as he says in the Tweet
knowledge and information aren't
necessarily good
so if you have more knowledge and more
information about reality
it makes you feel bad and can make you
depressed and sad and presumably
unhealthy
because the truth
is not good for you
now sometimes it's the only thing that
will save your life right so it's not
like it's all bad for you so of course
you need to know the truth for things
that are critical to your life as best
you can
but if you focus on what's true
just because it's true
it's bad for your health
did you know did does that surprise you
does it surprise you that looking at the
Ugly Truth
is bad for your mental health that's
pretty straightforward isn't it kind of
obvious now would you extend that to say
that anybody who's looking at slavery in
the past and the legacy of
discrimination if that's where they're
focusing
that that would make them unhealthy and
unsuccessful and unproductive
obviously
obviously a hundred percent of people
who understand the tools of success will
tell you that you should be focusing on
the truth
the truth will will people who are
let's say experts at the tools of
success what you should do to be
successful would they tell you to focus
on the truth
no
no they wouldn't
absolutely not you know what they tell
you to focus on
let's say uh your optimism for the
future
is that the truth
no optimism is literally an imagination
which you try to make true if you're
trying to be successful you're not
dealing with what's true you're dealing
with what you're going to make true
big difference it's not what is true
it's what you personally are going to
make true you're going to make yourself
have somebody who has a talent stack
therefore you're more hireable you're
going to make yourself smarter you're
going to make yourself Kinder you're
going to make yourself have more
gratitude
it's about you making the future but if
you focus on the future that is or the
future that was
I'm sorry the past that was and you
treat them like facts you say oh let's
let's focus on the real history
the real facts
that's really bad for you
it's necessary
I don't think you should forget any of
that stuff it's part of history is
necessary but if that's where your focus
in Good Luck that's that's a path to
failure
so that's more evidence of that theme
let's talk about Silicon Valley Bank you
know in the fog of War it was kind of
confusing wasn't it like what's
happening with Silicon Valley Bank but
finally we know the truth
I'll tell you the truth but first I'd
like to give a compliment to Megan Kelly
and this is a compliment for something I
am unaware of
in other words I haven't seen it but I
understand she had a very good uh debate
to hosting Vivek ramaswamy and David
Sachs who had very different opinions
about what to do with Silicon Valley
Bank
now that is what I want to see
thank you
thank you you want you want somebody
like Megan Kelly
like she's sort of a perfect example
somebody who can moderate you know
somebody who's a strong host who can
really know you know you talk you talk
let's get to this
you want you want to have enough time
you know not a not a two-minute TV hit
you don't have enough time but more
importantly you want to have the right
people
they were exactly the right people for
exactly that at exactly that point that
is a service to the country
so Megyn Kelly's you know media that
she's doing for you know everybody is
making money and doing their thing so
I'm not saying everything's you know
for the good of humankind there's always
a there's always a financial aspect to
it and should be that's you know good
things should be monetized but thank you
I haven't I haven't even seen it and I
love it now how many of you saw it did
any of you see it
yeah I'm seeing good comments that
people saw it right look can we have
more of that like an actual honest
well-moderated timely Perfect People
more of that please good job Megan Kelly
all right but let me tell you what we've
learned uh I've I've researched it and
what I found for sure
is that the failure was uh Trump's fault
for weakening the Dodd-Frank laws
or it was the fed's fault for raising
interest rate interest rates possibly
Biden's fault because of the election
but also bad Management's fault and
possibly uh the world economic forum for
pushing ESG which would be a distraction
and some say it may have uh may have
caused a quality problem in management
so it's either uh Trump's fault the
fed's fault Management's fault Biden's
fault or the world economics forms fault
but at least we've cleared that up now
that's not the only question
um there was some concern whether it was
a bailout or not a bailout so we finally
have Clarity on that
um
so it's a totally a bailout except it's
not a bailout because the public pays
for it which is a bailout except not
directly because it's really the FDIC
insurance that they've been collecting
for banks for a long time so really it's
the FDIC and the bank's insurance which
is paying but really that's kind of the
public because if we ran out of that the
other Banks fail once that becomes empty
that that deposit that's the public so
really really is a is a bailout and the
Public's paying for it except the
Public's not paying for it the banks are
paying for it except the public really
is paying for it so did that clear it up
I think I think you did
um
but then also it's not the banks that
would pay for and it's not the public
who pay for it because when the Silicon
Valley Bank assets are sold the assets
will go to reimburse whoever paid for it
which was either the public or the FDIC
depending how you look at it but really
it's the SBC sfb assets that are paying
for it
unless there's not enough because if
there's not enough assets then really
it's the FDIC who's paying for it but
that's not really the case because if
they run out of money then it's the
public debates for it so it's the public
to pay for it not the FDIC except it's
really the assets if they're enough
so
um
and also uh the good news is that by
guaranteeing the assets which is what
the government did they totally
prevented a run on banks except that's
not why they did it it wasn't to prevent
a run on Banks and we don't know if the
run on banks would have happened anyway
and only the weak Banks would have had
to run on Banks and the weak Banks
probably would have failed anyway no
matter what they did but they did it to
prevent a run on banks or possibly they
did it because as crony capitalism and
the uh Democrats in Silicon Valley or
what CNN calls the ATM for the Democrat
Party so really it was just an Insider
thing with VCS covering their own backs
and their good friends in Silicon Valley
had nothing to do with what's good for
banks or is stop the bank run and save
the country
but at least we know the answer now
um and here's the good news that the
actions that the government took totally
worked totally worked so the bank run is
over nothing to worry about or possibly
it's the first Domino because there are
a number of banks have been added to the
watch list and the interest rates are
still high and many people took the same
kind of risk in a different way so
really it's just the beginning of the
dominoes or it's all over or or we're
all good
so I hope I cleared it up if you've been
reading other unclear things
oh
that's that's why you come to me
well I saw something that impressed me
and made me feel good about my country
for like a minute and a half in it I
liked it
so representative Jeff Jackson gave a
video in which he explained what the
government was doing and why
and
I was impressed as hell
here's the most impressive thing about
representative Jeff Jackson
I listened to his entire video and wow
is he good at talking in public
it was so good that I wondered what his
background was it almost looked like
I don't know I don't even know how do
you get that good it was just a
communication
Superstar thing was he an actor I mean
it looks like he has those skills but it
was amazing but here's the part that
impressed me most it wasn't amazing
because he did a good job communicating
when he was done
just think about this when he was done
I couldn't tell if he was a Democrat or
Republican
think about that
I mean just think about that
that's how good he was
he was so good I couldn't tell if he was
a Democrat or Republican
I couldn't tell somebody said he's a
Democrat I even looked at his profile
and he does on his profile he doesn't
list his party
on his Twitter profile it's not listed
yeah and I think he said he's a dad and
a military veteran
he starts with Dad and then he does
military veteran
is that a Democrat or Republican and it
starts with Dad
yeah so I'd keep an eye on that guy I
think he's a Democrat but I would keep
an eye on him
like that's that's some serious skill
back I guess
um
and lastly maybe lastly
uh here's a prediction that I made that
you all scoffed at
maybe not well but you could tell me see
if anybody agreed with me when I made
this prediction
that no matter how the war in Ukraine
goes
whether Putin wins or Putin is a tie he
negotiates or Putin loses in all
situations Putin still has to kill the
head of the Wagner group
and he has to diminish the Wagner
group's power
would you agree how many would agree
that no matter how it goes Putin's gonna
have to get rid of pregosian the head of
the wagon group
now that was my prediction and I
predicted that you could that it was
actually happening that uh that Russia
or Putin was allowing the Wagner group
to just waste all their people and
resources and sort of uh losing
propositions
and that's what the Wagner group is
saying now but I want to give you one uh
one quote here
I kind of wrapped it up
um so this is a I think this is in CNN
so somebody named kovalinko I guess
that's somebody who knows something
about what's going on over there said
quote is it difficult to say whether
this was a planned destruction of the
Wagner PMC but the fact is the Russian
military command uses the wagnerites as
living meat
it's difficult to say whether this was a
planned destruction
planned by Putin
so now this is an actual somebody who
knows what they're talking about as
opposed to me like I don't really know
what I'm talking about but it looked
like it to me I mean from a distance it
looked like oh that pagosian guy's
getting too much power within Russia
he's got to be killed and the the best
way to do it would be for Putin to just
send him and his forces out to get
massacred
so well then no matter what happens
later there are fewer of them they're
less powerful
so that looks like it looks like other
people who know what they're talking
about think that's entirely possible and
I believe it's what's happening
so how many of you would agree with my
hypothesis
that Russia or Putin wants to degrade
the Wagner group whether he wins in the
Ukraine or not
yeah it looks like a lot of people agree
so I'm going to count that as one of my
best predictions if it if it comes true
I don't know if we'll ever be able to
confirm it but I think I'm the first
person in the at least in the country
who proposed that
now I don't know that it's true I'm not
claiming it's true right that would be
premature I'm saying that people who
know what they're talking about which
does not include me
are saying it's true
you saw it on isw
I don't know what that is so uh has
anybody seen that hypothesis in other
places
yet besides CNN today anybody who's seen
that so somebody says yes
yes some people see isn't it mind
reading it's speculation
no it's not mind reading it's it's based
on the fact that that's what anybody
would do
so it doesn't require mind reading it's
just how do people act in their best
interests
now those of you who are saying it's
wrong you could be right
I wouldn't I Wouldn't Die on this hill
it could be wrong
yeah I agree but it has that look
now if you think it's wrong
is that because you think Putin would
feel safe
if pogrogian won this war and came home
with a huge military that was loyal to
him
do you think Putin would be okay with
that
if you think I'm wrong you have to say
that Putin would be okay with that
now remember I'm a little bit of a
student of how dictators stay in in
power because I'm always curious it just
seems like it'd be impossible
and they tend to have this similar kind
of approach
one part of the dictator approach is
they form their own you know private
Army you know like in Iran the the
Republican guard or whatever it is so
you need your sort of you know your own
private loyal Army that's got better
weapons than the other Army that might
try to overthrow you so that's one thing
they do but another thing that dictators
do is they kill everybody who's against
them
right but also everyone who might be
against them later
if you're a dictator you don't kill only
the people who have directly moved
against you lately
you got to get all the people who might
have in any possible in any scenario
might have you got to get all the maybes
like that that's your basic dictator
brutal dictator technique right you got
to get all the maybes you can't just get
the ones who are definitely your enemies
and at the very least
purgosian is a maybe enemy
you cannot doubt that he's a maybe enemy
can you can can anybody here doubt that
would anybody doubt that progression is
a maybe enemy of Putin
no you can't doubt that and there's no
dictator like a Putin who's going to let
a maybe enemy stay around for long
pregosians could be dead in
one year or two there's no way he's
going to survive this
unless he leaves the country well even
then they had poisoned probably so I
don't think progosian can survive Putin
it would be crazy
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
is a conclusion of the best live stream
you're likely to see today
and I remind you again if you haven't if
you've been looking for a Dilbert
Dilbert has canceled worldwide but
continues daily in the Scott
adams.locals.com subscription site
uh those who have asked please can we
have the free version
the free version
means I don't get to do this anymore
right so everybody needs to pay the
bills
so part of how I'm going to pay the
bills is uh Dilbert will be in the
subscription site but what I give you in
return is way more than Dilbert and you
if you're a member of locals you can use
Dilbert for your own presentations
share them with friends just go don't do
it every day don't don't go nuts with it
but you have extra rights you get to see
robots renews my other comic as well as
let's the best memes you've ever seen
from the members themselves
um yeah I do have enough to pay the
bills you write
but
I can do more and better things for the
world yes I'm protected
um
so let me check in with you
has anybody seen my reframe of race
um where the the alternative way to look
at it is through the
personal success frame has anybody seen
that get boosted online or anywhere else
yet
because that's the test
okay I'm seeing seeing a number of yeses
uh the test is whether it
starts to take on a life of its own and
I think that because it's a high ground
reframe meaning that nobody can disagree
with it it's actually impossible to
disagree with and once you've seen it
you can't get it out of your head
right so that that's that's what a good
uh anti-viral looks like now I call it
an antiviral
because there's a mind virus
that the best way to deal with the
current world is to Look Backwards at
all the the Badness that happened and
assign blame and then you know get
restitution for it
that that model of the world is just
inferior
to a forward-looking model no matter who
you are it doesn't matter who you are
right looking forward Works looking
backwards doesn't work and there's no
conversation about that looking
backwards can work in the short run but
you're always going to come out worse
than if you look forward
what does Elon Musk say oh that's a joke
huh not a joke all right
you screenshot the Whiteboard share okay
yeah I saw people uh so so here's how
you know if an idea is going to catch on
if people do something with the idea
such as turn it into a poster somebody
said they screenshot it to send it to
somebody those are actions when you see
people act on what is a reframe that
means the reframe is working
so this has all of the Tells of
something that will just continue
expanding
it because it's sort of an anti-virus to
the existing virus yeah so I need an
antiviral that's also viral that has to
reproduce in order to reduce the effect
of the virus
all right uh cell posters no I wouldn't
sell them I might make one that's a
digital one
all right
so that ladies and gentlemen brings you
to the end of the best live stream ever
and I'm going to talk to the locals
people privately one of the benefits of
membership and I will see you tomorrow
