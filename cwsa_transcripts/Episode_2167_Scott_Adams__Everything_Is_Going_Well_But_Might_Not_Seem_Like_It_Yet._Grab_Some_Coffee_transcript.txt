to do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
probably the best thing that's ever
happened to you
and uh if you'd like to take this up to
another level
well there's a way to do it and it's not
hard just follow along all you need is a
copper a mug or a glass a tanker Charles
is dying the canteen geographlowska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the parallel pleasure of the
dopamine here of the day the thing that
makes everything better is called the
simultaneous sip
happens now
go
ah
well I need to warn you that today will
be the worst dad joke you've ever heard
worst dad joke you've ever heard
you'll know it when it happens
I won't have to tell you in advance
you'll just know it
all right well here are the stories
uh apparently there's an otter
who is stealing surfboards
somewhere around Santa Cruz I think and
this otter had been raised in captivity
and somehow had been acclimated to
humans but when it sees people surfing
it uh goes and tries to grab their
surfboard away from them and if it gets
it it jumps on top and surfs
that's right it's a surfing otter
now apparently they're having trouble
locating the otter because what they
want to do is relocate it if they can
catch it they're going to relocate it
but apparently there are two problems
in identifying this otter number one is
that Otter's uh I don't know if you knew
this but
otters look a lot alike
has anybody ever told you that
if you've seen one otter
you've kind of seen them all so that's
the first problem but there's a bigger
problem is that when you stop an otter
and you say are you that surfboard
stealing otter
what do they usually say
no it's the other one
it stopped me it's the other one
all right
well I hate you too
[Laughter]
all right here's a little preview
if you happen to be subscribing to the
Dilbert reborn comic which you can only
see if you subscribe but either at the
Scott adams.locals
place where you can see lots more than
that or if you just want to see the
comic itself on Twitter you can
subscribe but uh Dilbert CEO is going to
have a cage match
uh with another CEO
nudity might be involved
that's all I'm going to say it's going
to be a series for the week but Dilbert
CEO will be in an possibly naked cage
match with another CEO
I don't want to tell you that it goes
well
but uh let's just say that their
relationship may be kicking off at that
moment
it might be the beginning of Something
Beautiful is what I'm saying
see it's a Twist didn't see that comment
did you
trick twist
well uh by the way Elon Musk does
subscribe to Dilbert Reborn
so it must be so strange to him imagine
being Elon Musk and you wake up in the
morning and half of the news is about
you
just every day
half of the news is about you and then
you you try to get away from the news by
reading your your comics
and uh
you read the comics and there you are
again all right well that's weird
so how about this somebody invented
better white paint
ah that's pretty exciting isn't it it's
white page but it's way better
okay there's more to it than that
apparently white paint is not all the
same so there's this new white paint
that can reduce the temperature of your
roof or anything else you put it on by
quite a bit so in the middle of the day
you can have a eight degrees cooler roof
than you would have otherwise with a
different color
that's pretty big and at night it could
be a difference of 19 degrees
so is that weird that if you had a some
black paint and some of the special
white paint so the black paint would be
presumably the the most absorbing so
that'd be sort of the worst case
scenario and then he had white paint
right next to it
you could have a 19 degree difference
and they're just sitting there just
sitting outside
just in there
19 degree difference does that even seem
possible to you
but apparently the the secret is it
reflects a lot of light out
now
how can it work at night
am I missing something
did I read this wrong
and up to 19 degrees cooler at night
but the way it works is by reflecting
the Sun
how does it reflect Sun at night
am I missing something in this story
what
uh
off the Moon
all right well I'm not sure I believe
this if you could actually make a 19
degree all right are there any Engineers
here today
any engineers in the house
if you could make something 19 degrees
difference
in the same location and it just stays
that way it never it never balances out
it's just always a different temperature
couldn't you build a Sterling engine
that just ran forever based on that on
that factor
because the Sterling engine uh is an
engine that already exists doesn't have
to be invented and it operates entirely
off of temperature differentials
now presumably the greater the
temperature differential the more power
you generate
but
um what a 19 degree difference give you
anything
would you even get a little bit of
Sterling engine action out of 19 degrees
I'm seeing some people say now I think
no is the right answer
19 it would be weak but would it be zero
I know it would be weak but it would it
would actually be no energy at all
probably or at least hard to measure
all right it doesn't scale up
man that would make sense
um
I saw I saw a material the other day I
forget what it's called have you ever
seen this material that's metal
and if you heat it it will go back to
its original condition after it's been
bent
and by seeing that I forget what it's
called there's a name for it but I can't
figure out why you can't make a
Perpetual engine and of just that
how hard would it be to make an engine
where you have a spring and then you
stretch out the spring because it's you
know it's metal so you can stretch it
and then you just apply heat
and then the spring goes back to its
natural place and and picks up an item
and then you change the heat that goes
down there's no way to have it
seek Heat
and then create energy there's enough
energy to find it to seek coldness maybe
circling around in some way no you still
need a heat source so it wouldn't be
perpetual motion that's correct so it
wouldn't be perpetual motion that would
be an outside the heat Source but
there's always an outside resource
there's always one there's always a heat
differential
you know if all you did is drill into
the ground
the temperature would be pretty
different most of the time I know it
just seems like we've got enough here we
can build our own
engine that works forever not Perpetual
engine but not perpetual motion
all right
um
so that wasn't too interesting
it's a weird news day
um here's a question I saw on Twitter
and the amuse Twitter account which is a
pretty provocative account amuse
anyway
um he tweeted this oops Biden's doj
indicted a man for failing to register
as a foreign agent while working for
cefc which is China Energy company
James Biden both work for the same
company and neither registered as
foreign agents White House has no
comment
okay this is going to be if this is true
you know all of the stories have if this
is true attached to them
if it's true
how do you handle that
you know I suppose they'll find some
small difference in the cases oh that
one case where we did prosecute that was
quite different than this in ways that
we can't think of right now
but is in my imagination
um
no I'm not an engineer actually
that's somebody who's calling me an
engineer no I'm not a not an engineer
um I just worked with him
so it's going to be
gonna be kind of embarrassing if in fact
the bidens do not get indicted for
something that somebody was exactly
doing and indicted for
but have we reached a point
where there's literally nothing nothing
in the news that makes us act
differently
it's like we watch the news but
nothing's different it was just the same
stuff
so are we actually seeing a situation
where we know for sure there's no doubt
about it that the bidens did exactly
what somebody went to jail for
is that our actual real life situation
we're looking at somebody who went to
jail for exactly the same crime and just
nothing will happen
just nothing
that's what it looks like but I remind
you
that you're in a deep bubble on the
right
doesn't mean you're wrong it just means
that your bubble doesn't have any
correspondence to the left bubble do you
know what the story about the Biden's
you know obvious corruption and money
taking us do you know what that story is
on the left
it's all been debunked
it's all been proven to be just a
right-wing conspiracy and there's
nothing to worry about in the Biden's
Financial dealings
that's actually what the people on the
left are here there's nothing there
do you believe that
I mean if you could check yourself
check the news yourself it just doesn't
exist and where they talk about it they
say it was debunked
so I don't know where that goes
because first of all I can't tell what's
true if you're sure you know what's true
I don't know I don't think we live in
that world anymore where you can
actually be sure you know what's true
anymore
so am I in the bubble or are you in the
bubble or is the entire left in a bubble
and is one of those bubbles true
and one of them isn't but just think
about the fact you know if you're my
audience you've probably been saturated
with claims about the Biden's bad
behavior and collecting money from other
countries
the entire half of the country is
unaware of any of this
or if they're aware of it they think
it's been debunked or handled or wasn't
technically illegal so leave it alone
you know that sort of thing I don't
think we could be more
in different bubbles than we are we are
right now I mean during the Trump time
it was pretty bad but this is weirdly
weirdly aggressive bubbling
this is some super bubbling with heavy
sides because imagine
if your bubble is the correct one you're
probably in the same one I am
in my bubble it's completely obvious
that the bidens are corrupt
and have been for years
is there anybody would disagree with
that characterization and I mean like
super corrupt like as corrupt as you
could possibly be taking massive amounts
of money from you know uh
foreign Nemesis that's about as bad as
you can get
so most of you are in that bubble
would you agree that the left is
absolutely unaware
of whatever it is you think you see or
do see I mean don't even know if it's
real
but you would agree that the other side
doesn't see any of it right it's just
not there
all they see is uh yeah Biden's getting
up there in age but he's doing a good
job because that's what the news is
telling them
so
well there's that
um and I guess uh Christopher Ray is
going to
uh how did the FBI is going to testify
in Congress
and help people have helpfully suggested
some questions he could be answered
asked including Vivek and
um I saw some other people do that and I
think Jim Jordan suggested the question
and uh
uh Maggie and a whole bunch of people
so
do you think he'll be asked the right
questions
kind of depends who's doing the asking
right
but there are some really good questions
and I think it was Jim Jordan who
tweeted one of the questions he'd like
to see asked is have have you ever been
asked by the administration to you know
slow down some investigation
how do we not know the answer to that
already
do we really have to put them under you
have to put them under oath ask that
question we don't know that yet
but I guess we'll find out
I think he won't comment
that's that's what I think what do you
think
I believe he will not directly ask to
answer the question did anybody ask you
to slow anything down
yeah yeah oh my help
huh
all right
um the New York Post is reporting today
that you know you're not going to
believe this
um
but there is speculation now even among
the military heads in the United States
uh they're actually thinking that the
Wagner boss burgosian
he might be dead or captured
huh
so they're they're just starting to
think
hey hey
wait a minute
are you telling me that the most brutal
murdering dictator of our time Putin
are you telling me he didn't let him go
to Belarus and live his life happily
after trying to kill Putin ah huh
so it's almost like Putin uh might hold
a grudge of some sort
I mean I'm quite surprised at this
this speculation
you know I was thinking about changing
the name of this live stream to
the news before his news
because I feel as though there are quite
a few times I've told you the news weeks
or in some cases years before it
happened
you how many how many examples can you
think of where I told you the news like
months or years before it was in the
news
and you just watch it and said oh
he did it again
quite a few times I've done it I've done
it live and in public quite a few times
that doesn't mean they're all right
I have also had incorrect predictions
it's happened
but I would like to give you this
reframe which I'll probably be putting
into a micro lesson for my local
subscribers
it goes like this
design is Destiny
isn't that quotable I hope nobody said
it before I did because it sounds very
quotable
design is Destiny
here's what I mean by that
if you look at uh let's say how the
higher education
has designed their
admissions policy
if you just looked at how they designed
it you wouldn't have to wonder how it
will turn out
would you
the design tells you exactly what's
going to happen the design of the higher
institutions of Education guaranteed
that they would gain the system to
discriminate against white people and
Asian Americans
it was pretty much guaranteed by the
design
and then further it was guaranteed
because we have a constitution
that it would come to a head
and then the Supreme Court would have to
say that's too much
every bit of that was predictable by
Design
because we designed a system that
largely guaranteed that outcome
would you agree
it was a design that guaranteed the
outcome
so very much like uh free speech and
other things these are systems that we
have you can pretty much tell by looking
at the system what's going to happen
take uh take lower education
let's say you know the K-12
so we've got a design where the teachers
are in a uh let's say adversarial
relationship with the students
it's designed because there's a union
it's designed as an adversarial
relationship
what do you think is going to happen
do you have to be a genius or a psychic
to know that if you design a system
where the teachers are adversarial to
the children their interests don't
they're not the same
what are you going to get
you got to get a system that's good for
teachers
and that's what we got
and not so good for the kids and no
competition no free market you know lots
of uh you know CRT and whatever so
you should have known from day one
that's what you're gonna get
so what are the tricks that I use for
predicting the future
is I look at the design
the design usually tells you what's
going to happen design is destiny
all right
so that's part of the trick
um some of you probably have seen the
interview with Tucker Carlson and Andrew
Tate
I've watched much of it something tells
me it's going to start repeating a
little bit because it already did so I
don't know if I can get through two
hours but I will give you the following
observations
number one
Andrew Tate who I am no fan of meaning
personally I just don't like him
personally for personal reasons has
nothing to do with this public persona I
just he discuss personally
but that has nothing to do as personal
persona
in terms of the way he presents himself
he has one of the best persuasion Talent
Stacks you will ever see
his his uh his talent stack for doing
exactly what he does
is just the strongest freaking thing
I've ever seen
it is insane you know as good as Trump
is and he's amazing in terms of
influence and persuasion
Trump doesn't have quite the physicality
part
so so Andrew Tate has the physicality he
just looks big and muscular and you know
he's well dressed and put together so
he's got that part of his persuasion
because people don't really want to
listen to you know let's say Michael
Moore
right if he looks sort of sloppy you
don't it's harder to buy into his
message
so he's got that he's got perfect
communication skills
if you listen to him there's no Oz or
ums
he never is searching for the right word
it's always right there
super high IQ it looks like
but he used probably every trick of
persuasion and when I say trick I don't
mean you know that sounds like it's a
dirty trick or something but I mean
technique
he has every tool it's really crazy and
you know I could call them out but it's
all the usual stuff
but did you see how um if you watched it
all did you see his uh
pacing and matching with Tucker
like he was giving Tucker exactly what
Tucker wanted to hear
and Tucker was responding to it very
friendly which allowed them to bond you
know like the two guys agreeing on
everything
it was
in terms of a persuasion
um project
it was insane it was just really good
now
do we believe that what Tate said to
describe his own legal Jeopardy and what
he did do and what he didn't do
did anybody watch it enough and come up
to an opinion as to whether he's telling
you this great truth
is his version look real now his version
roughly goes like this
the only charges after all of those
alleged charges that you heard
everything from you know just horrible
potential charges after all that time
the only thing they came up with
according to him right this is his
version I'm not claiming this is true
just because remember everybody who's
accused of a crime
they get to do their version too so
don't assume that the person trying to
protect themselves as tell you all the
facts
but allegedly he's out according to his
version is he's only being charged with
this lover boy
uh crime and that says that you pretend
to be let's say romantically or
interested in a woman and that you use
that as your influence to get her to do
something
that makes you money in the sexual realm
right but but apparently he's only being
charged according to him again
I'd like I'd have to hear a Romania's
version of this but according to him
uh Tate he is being charged with being a
nice guy to some women who later started
Tick Tock accounts and made money from
it and he's being accused of taking
their money and yeah sort of
forcing them through his persuasive
Excellence to become basically online
online sex workers or something
but first of all it's tick tock so you
can't do that much online sex work on
Tick Tock can you I guess you can make
money somehow
uh but did he need their money he's
saying it's a trivial amount and of
course he didn't take their money
I don't know
how would I know
so I would say it seems it seems very
unlikely
uh well James is saying he admitted
trafficking
that might be technically true
but it's only because trafficking has
such a broad definition that you could
sort of accidentally do it
so
be careful about that definition of
trafficking because apparently
trafficking includes
um
coercing somebody to start a tick tock
account
is that does that sound like trafficking
to you
would you call it that if you persuaded
somebody to open up a tick tock account
to make money for themselves now I don't
know if that's what happened I'm just
saying if it happened
would that be trafficking apparently it
would be
apparently in Romania that would be
trafficking
persuading somebody hey you know it'd be
a good idea is you opened up your own
Tick Tock account you can make some
money
and then you go to jail
now I'm exaggerating a little bit
but it is we don't quite understand
what the charge is and why it's why it's
so bad and
um what does Romania have or not have
now part of what uh
Tate was suggesting without saying it
directly because he doesn't want to make
anybody too mad while he's still in
legal Jeopardy is he's suggesting that
Great Britain and maybe the United
States were behind his arrest in other
words Romania has a close
has had a long close association with
the U.S and Great Britain and the
thinking is that Great Britain had
already spoken out against Tate the
politician said thought he was ruining
the young men in their in their country
and
so take wonders if maybe
you know the Matrix and those in power
we're trying to bring him down
and the the larger theory behind that
which you've all heard in the right
wingosphere
uh
well I should Remind You by the way in
an upcoming Dilbert reborn comic Dilbert
will be in jail
in albonia and his cellmates will be the
tape Brothers
so that's upcoming wait for that but you
can only see that if you subscribe
anyway uh
so what do you think what do you think
of the hypothesis
that in order for the bad people who
want to change the world
in order to do it their way they have to
make men eunuchs in other words uh cut
off the balls of men either literally or
psychologically so that men will not
complain
because men are the only ones that can
stop them
in other words strong men could stop the
people in power whoever they might be
from doing the Terrible Things They want
to do whatever that might be but first
they have to get rid of all the Andrew
Tates and the you know the male strong
male figures
yeah they could do it from a from a
pharmacologically or physically or
psychologically
now do you think that there's anything
to that
do you believe that there's anyone
anywhere
who consciously consciously said you
know what
I think we can push this ESG thing
better if we get rid of all the dominant
men
so there are people who think that
actual conversation happened among
people who could make it happen in other
words people could affect that change
all right I'm gonna have to give you a
really on this one
really
really
you think that people actually had that
conversation
and then they had also the power to
implement it
and then in a whole variety wide variety
of ways they figured out how to take
power from men so they could control
things
but you think it was a conscious
planned
actually like a meeting or a
conversation which the actual words were
spoken out loud hey we've got a we've
got to suppress these manly men because
they're the only ones who can stop us
from our evil plan
all right well
here's what I think
would you like a simpler hypothesis
here's a simpler hypothesis
women who don't like men have
turned out to be in charge
that's it
women who are not big fans of men
have gotten more power
and men have sort of LED them but
basically it's just that women are more
powerful at the same time the LGBT
community community is doing great in
terms of you know their power and
influence and visibility and all that so
those are two forces which are different
from
and in some cases opposed to you know
masculinity
but why do you need anybody in charge
to make all that happen
you don't so you would our world would
look exactly the same if nobody had
planned it
that's my point it looks like a plan
doesn't it because there's so many ways
that masculinity is under attack it's
hard to imagine that it could all be
accidental coincidental right it doesn't
seem like it's way too coincidental it's
like everything really everything seems
anti-masculine just everything
but I'll say it again you would get to
exactly that place simply by having more
women in charge who are not crazy about
men
and that's exactly what we observe would
you say it's true that all you know
governments institutions Etc are being
populated with more and more women
and all we're seeing is the female
perspective
um
being let's say manifest through the
government and through corporations
because there are lots of women now lots
of women in those positions
remember I said design is Destiny
so you've got a world where let's say
there's a lot of masculinity it may be
toxic maybe even too much
so that's your world and then you change
the design
to really really promote more women and
lgbtq
um participation
and then it works because you've
designed it to do that so now you've got
lots and lots of women and lgbtq people
what what is the most predictable thing
that would happen with that design
you've designed it to vastly increase
the female and lgbtq voices and
influence
how can it go any other way
why would you need anybody planning it
the only thing you need is more women
and more lgbtq people in power
and as soon as you get it
they should
if everything works the way the world
always works they should be expressing
their preferences
as they get power
and do you think that women prefer a
patriarchy all the time
well sometimes they do but lots of times
they don't so the the don'ts get
introduced into the mix what else are
you gonna get
the only thing that could that could
happen with a system that's encouraging
you have more voices is that the mix of
what you believe will change
how could it go any other way
right so I don't believe that so so to
me the the change and the let's say the
the respect for masculinity
it was completely predictable from day
one of Designing A system that would
promote voices that were not that
how does that not make sense
why would you need a meeting
all you have to do is want equal rights
for everybody and you end up here
equal rights and the desire to give
everybody a good chance in society would
be guaranteed guaranteed there's no
other way it can go you're guaranteed to
end up here
I would bet that every country that's
had a similar trajectory
ended up here
no matter where they started from
if they designed a system that was oh we
have too many men running things let's
let's fix that how else could it end up
there isn't any other way it could go so
if you imagine there had to be people
planning it
to get to here you're you're missing the
biggest picture which is it couldn't
have gone any other way
you don't need to plan something that's
just going to happen
right
now are there individuals
who have ever said you know what would
be good is you know if you were men in
charge and blah blah of course
but I just don't think it's a meeting
with a plan
right that's my take
so I think that uh Andrew Tate needs you
to be persuaded that there are some kind
of evil forces looking to Tamp down his
masculinity
um when I in fact I think they're just
people who didn't like his message and
it wasn't compatible with a world where
women have as much power as they do now
people like Scott is why we still have
ESG
somebody actually wrote that in the
comment
that people like me is why we still have
ESG
first day on social media
were you uh maybe an alien who just took
over a human body today
did you learn your language skills from
watching television like E.T
how could you come up with the dumbest
comment in the history of comments
without some like putting some work into
it did you have to like work all morning
and say what is what is the dumbest
thing I can say in public what would it
be
but you nailed it you nailed it
all right
um so I did catch up on what's the beef
between Mike cernovich and Jordan
Peterson first of all I don't know if
Jordan Peterson is part of the beef
I don't know that he's responded in any
way but uh sir now has
I guess I guess one of the topics or
maybe other things I disagree on but one
of the topics was Jordan Peterson
thought that
um it's a bad idea to have Anonymous
accounts on social media
specifically Twitter because the
anonymous accounts hide the narcissists
and the dark Triad personalities who are
basically the sadists and the bad people
and a lot of people say no we need free
speech so anonymity helps that so
sirovich
um
is accusing Jordan Peterson of being a
narcissist well at the same time
saying that anonymity attracts
narcissists
what do you think of that what do you
think of that critique
that Jordan Peterson says no you got to
keep those narcissists off of Twitter
but Certo says but you're obviously one
you know you've got your uh he called
out his uh custom suits
you know Jordan Peterson wears suits
that look like no suit you could buy you
know his jackets look like they're made
just for him I guess they are
and that uh he never saw a microphone he
didn't like or something I guess that's
what Mike is saying
so what do you think of that
is that is that a good point he's he's
the Jordan Peterson is saying hey keep
these narcissists off there but yet at
the same time he would be the most
obvious narcissist on social media
I think they're both right but
um here's the caveat there are two kinds
of narcissism
Jordan Peterson is my kind
he's also Mike sirovich's kind
do you know what uh Jordan Peterson bike
sternovich and I all have in common
we all like the microphone
hello yeah we're all narcissists
obviously
I don't think you need to be a you know
do you need to be a therapist to know
that the three of us are in the same
category
really
aren't we like super obviously the same
person
in a way right in terms of the way we
deal with the public we're really all
the same person
in my view and we're all major
narcissists
that's my self-identification but people
don't realize that there are different
kinds the grandiose narcissist loves the
Limelight loves the attention
but only likes it if you're doing
something good for the country
in other words if you're making
something better
and you're getting a lot of attention
perfect
that's my perfect situation I would only
like to make things better and I would
love it if you would give me some credit
for it
is that wrong
what am I an because I want to
help you and then I think I think the
natural the natural outcome of that
should be you should give me credit if I
succeed
am I the
don't you want more of me
you know don't you need more Jordan
Peterson more Mike cernovich
I I would clone both of those guys give
me give me a million of both of them
because that's the kind of people I want
to say I want to see people saying that
doing something good for the public
is so worthy that I'll put myself out
there and I don't mind getting some
credit
not so crazy
but the other kind it needs to be said
that the dark Triad the other kind of
narcissist they're more like sadists
I don't really have I don't have a like
a single whiff of sadism in me like
nothing about that sounds fun to me
so that's a completely different animal
so we you really have a problem with
just the definitions
of what a narcissist is
all right um
I saw somebody on social media say that
I said that uh Trump would win or
um yeah Trump would win
um I would like to clarify
what I said was I think unless maybe I
said it wrong so most of you saw it so
tell me if I said it wrong uh what I say
is that Trump has a very clear path all
the way to the presidency
the only thing that could stop him from
just walking down the sidewalk that has
no obstructions all the way to the
presidency
is stuff you don't see coming
of which there will be plenty there'll
be a lot of stuff coming between them
and the election I mean there will be so
many surprises right so that that clear
sidewalk is not going to be clear the
whole time there's going to be all kinds
of new obstructions so you can't really
predict there will be no obstructions
right
the only thing I predict is if Trump
took a certain approach to the rest of
the campaign
he would have no friction whatsoever he
would just walk right into it
for example
if he could soften his stand on the
election irregularity
but that's probably impossible
I just don't think it'll happen but
imagine if he said you know I've used
this example before but I need to round
out my point
suppose he said and I'm not saying he
will
I'm just saying he could
he could just say you know what we will
never agree about what happened in 2020
we could all agree it was a terrible
time in our history
but can we all agree that we need to fix
the system so it doesn't happen again
and he could also say what I said which
is we don't know if it was rigged
honestly we did not prove it I gotta
admit we didn't prove it however the
system is not fully auditable and if you
elect me I'll work hard to make sure it
is
he'd walk right into the presidency
he would just say you know I don't think
we'll ever decide what happened we'll
never know what happened in 2020 because
the problem is
our system is designed oh here it is
again
design is Destiny
does the current design of our election
systems with electronic elements that
other countries don't use and are hard
to completely audit does that design
guarantee
that you'll have Fair elections or does
it guarantee in the long run they'll be
rigged
all right you know the answer to that
that situation the current design of our
system guarantees raking
you just don't know when
if Trump ever said that that it would
just break the whole
um internet
if he just said the desired of the
system
which can't be fully and quickly audited
especially after the vote because once
the vote happens you know that the
Court's standards of what they're
willing to look at can get modified
because they don't want to rock the boat
too much
so he could just say the current design
of the system guarantees rigging but we
don't even need to talk about whether it
happened in the past
the only case I'm going to make to you
today is that it's designed in a way
that guarantees it's going to happen
sometime
so why don't we agree and fix that
could you imagine him saying that
imagine him saying you know what I have
to admit January 6 got out of control it
wretches back I wonder if you know I
wish I'd been more aggressive in tamping
down the uh the violence
how hard would that be
how hard would it be to say you know it
was it was way worse than it should have
been I do have some second thoughts
about whether I could have done more
done
right done because people just want to
hear
what he was thinking and that it wasn't
some evil thing just you know yeah you
got a point it could have been better
could have been better
so
all right that's enough on him I would
also like to say again that ramaswamy
souls for Trump
um too early to know who would be a vice
president pick and I'm endorsing
ramaswamy so I'd like like him to win it
outright and by the way he's doing great
if you're watching the Press
that Vivek is getting for fake his press
is great
I mean he's starting to be included in
the conversation whenever you're talking
about the you know the candidates which
is a big deal because I don't see Nikki
Haley just automatically being part of
the conversation right so the
conversation recently was about
right-wing people exercising
you like it's a right-wing thing but I
think RFK Jr was one of the people that
they mentioned which is weird he's a
Democrat but Vivek is also highlighted
his Fitness because he's a good tennis
player for example
and so he's found ways to be part of the
top conversation that's a big deal
I don't think Nikki Haley did that
I don't think Mike Pence did that nobody
was talking about Mike Pence this week
Mike Pence gets used as examples have
you noticed that the only thing Mike
Pence is for is for an example of
something else
well Mike Pence for example
that's it he's just the example guy
all right and would you say at this
point
yes or no
that the entire press coverage of
DeSantis has caught up with my first
take
is that true or not my first take was he
was well I I borrowed my first tank
really from
Bill Maher
that as soon as you start seeing
DeSantis as the tribute band you can't
just can't see it any other way just
can't say it any other way
and I think the Press has caught up to
that they're just being the capable
governor
the capable capable Governor guy is not
gonna
you know it's not going to be enough
we don't need a capable governor
to be our leader of the country
you know what a capable Governor would
be good for
governor
perfect job for a capable guy who
doesn't make anything exciting
all right well the FDA is continuing
loosening up on psychedelics so there's
some more guidance on Research which
apparently gives people more abilities
so there the guidelines to cover LSD
psilocybin you know that's mushrooms and
includes ketamine and MDMA
and there's just so much evidence at
this point just so much evidence that
these these things are good for stress
and PTSD and depression and anxiety and
just all kinds of stuff
so
do you know why the Food and Drug
Administration is
managing this process
instead of let's say just making it
illegal do you know the FDA is so active
in this take a guess what's your guess
why would the FDA be accurate because
without the FDA
there's no way to make it illegal for
ordinary people to treat themselves with
the same chemicals you what they're
doing is creating an industry for a big
Pharma
which will exclude you from growing your
own mushrooms in the backyard
that's what's happening right in front
of your eyes you're watching the theft
of the American public the whole the
whole world really
because these chemicals that they're
they're looking at from LSD to mushrooms
ketamine these are so cheap
that they are basically universally
available if you look for them right
pretty much everybody could buy these
things and
current indications are
that these things would solve your
biggest medical and mental problems
pretty handily and lots of evidence that
they do
what is your worst case scenario by
Design
lets you design design is Destiny right
let's look at the design of the FDA
the FDA is captured
do you agree the FDA is designed with
this um you know the individuals going
back and forth from Pharma jobs it means
that Pharma has captured the FDA so
that's your desire
what does that design
predict about the illegality and
availability of these Miracle drugs from
mushrooms to ketamine what what is
guaranteed by the design of our current
system what's guaranteed is that to
protect the Pharma industry the FDA
which is basically you know an agency of
big Pharma will work with them to make
sure that the only mushroom entity you
can take comes in a pill form from one
of the big Pharma companies
and if you try to get it on the street
you're going to jail
you're going to jail
if you don't buy into the business model
they're creating right in front of you
not for your benefit
this is not for your benefit they can
sell it as for your benefit because
that's what the FDA does they make sure
it's safe but for these specific drugs
um
they're just going to try to turn it
into some Pharma approved
version of these
so this is perhaps one of the greatest
thefts from the American public of all
time imagine the size of the market for
the drugs that eliminate your PTSD your
depression your anxiety
and just about every other
problem you have imagine the cost of
that and you know it's the biggest
problem with these drugs
from a from an economic model what's the
biggest problem with mushrooms
do you know
they cure you
that's right you don't need to do the
mushroom every day
it cures you
forever
do you think the big Pharma people want
something that cures you of their most
money-making diseases I don't know if
this is the most money making but I
gotta think depression is way up there
in the money making form of business
now the big Pharma has to find a way
that only they can make the pill and
everybody else is illegal
but also it has to be a shitty pill
because they can't work as well as the
actual stuff if they make it work in a
pill form you're going to take two
 pills and never need them again
if they make sure that you need one
every week well you're in business so
now given the design of the FDA
and the design of the Pharma give me
your prediction will big Pharma create a
pill that you just need one
and you get all the benefits of
psychedelics just one bill wow lucky and
it was only ten dollars
and it only cost ten dollars because
it's you know naturally found how how
expensive is LSD if you made it in bulk
probably not too expensive be like 10
cents a year right if you made it in
bulk so yeah give me a ten dollar pill
just one of them and I will cure most of
my mental problems forever no there
isn't a single chance there's not any
chance that that could ever come to pass
because the system is designed to
guarantee it doesn't
the system design
the system is designed to guarantee that
big Pharma does make pills and maybe
injections because they'd be more
expensive
and that they will never be done taking
them you'll you'll need them you're
going to need a better need an update
every week or
anybody want to take the other bet
do you want to make a bet that a year
let's say five years from now or
whenever it whatever happens do you want
to make a bet that the news reports
exactly what I just told you in a few
years exactly what I just told you
that big Pharma has a pill it's the only
one that's legal but you got to take it
a lot you know you'll never be done your
PTSD will never be completely gone with
these bills
now you don't want to take the other
side of that bet
all right there's a funny story about a
Dei activist I saw this also in a tweet
by the amuse account
and so there's a DI activist
who got recruited by Texas A M
to run its journalism Department
but she's now refusing that job
because she learns she can be fired if
she implements racist policies that
discriminate discriminate against Asian
Jewish or white students
so she's staying at UT where she she
won't have a problem now
I'm trying to understand this story
is what is what happened here
um
is what happened here that there were
two Texas
uh entities of higher institution one of
them in which it would be illegal to
teach
her her you know her field of Dei
so at one college in Texas it would be
illegal
but at another College it would be
required
am I right about that that within Texas
in one state one college maybe one is
one is private and one is a state
college
so maybe the state college it's illegal
but that the private college is required
so in the same state you could have one
thing that's both illegal
and also at the same time in the same
state
mandatory
do I have that right
yeah I think I have that right there's
both mandatory and illegal
just depending on which bill which job
you took
have we reached Peak absurdity that's
just Peak absurdity
all right
here are two stories that uh oh no uh
everybody's going to want to say Scott
why didn't you talk about that minister
of energy or whatever from Spain who
took a jet and then wrote a car to her
meeting but then to show that she was in
favor of green stuff she got on a
bicycle but she was caught getting out
of the car so really she's a big
hypocrite because she's promoting
bicycles but really she didn't get there
on a bicycle that was just for show and
she's a big old hypocrite
I don't see any of that
I don't know what you're saying I mean I
saw the story
but you think that's the story
do you think she was trying to trick you
that she rode her bike from Spain
is anybody who thought she rode her bike
from Spain
anybody
or do you think it's more likely is it
slightly more likely
that she wasn't trying to hide anything
she just wanted to promote bicycle
riding
and then maybe this wasn't exactly the
right bicycle riding situation but she
wanted to promote bicycles
so she just promoted bicycles and then
everybody connected all these dots they
shouldn't be connected
oh to me it looked like a non-story it
just looks like a summer story
summer story meaning the things that
aren't real stories but you have to have
something to talk about in the summer
all right uh
apparently uh the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration is predicting
a normal hurricane a normal hurricane
season
so despite the fact that CO2
is should be at all-time highs
and despite the fact that that should
guarantee give you weird hurricanes that
are worse
this year they'll be fine
now that doesn't mean there's no climate
change I'm not saying that
I'm just saying that the thing that
causes climate change
seems not to be causing climate change
now there could be good scientific
reasons for that very scientific
I don't know what they are and the the
best answer is
that even if climate change is exactly
what the scientists say it is it doesn't
mean that every year goes up
they've said that forever it never means
that every year goes up it means the
average over time is going up because
there are other factors El ninos and
whatever that can distorted in any given
year
so that story with Story number one is
this CO2 is at a record high
but hurricanes were unchanged
at least for one year
all right here's another story see if
this sounds like that story but it's
completely different see what see what's
in common
um our
uh national debt is at an all-time high
yes
money printing national debt all-time
high right
uh inflation went down again
inflation went down
it's at a new two-year low down to three
percent maybe 3.1 in June and that's the
lowest level in more than two years
so the CO2 is at the maximum
but the Hurricanes aren't going to
change at least this year
and our our debt and money printing is
at an all-time high like way all-time
high
and inflation which should move with
that
went down
can we predict anything
can we predict anything
all right let's use design equals
prediction
so climate change uses science
to predict right climate change uses
science to predict
um
economists use economics
to predict inflation
but what if we use design instead
because design is Destiny
so if I were to look at design for a
climate change I would say to myself
well our desire is that we give massive
funding to people who say that climate
change is a disaster that's coming
really soon
would you agree that the funding goes to
the people who say that climate change
is bad
that's our design
what would you get huh I wonder how that
would turn out
racking my brain if you give all the
money to the people who have one opinion
and zero money plus a lot of you know
professional uh insults and shame if
they disagree how is that going to go
how which way is that going to go
right design is Destiny
you can tell exactly what the scientists
will say by the design of the
the model there's no doubt about it
but did that tell you what the
Hurricanes would do no it only told you
what the scientists would do
the only thing you could predict is what
the scientists will do
you can't predict the hurricanes
um
all right
show me the incentive and I'll show you
the outcome exactly
let's talk about those Amish you know
I've had real questions about the uh the
belief that the Amish or so so here's
the claim which I'll tell you is not
true but the claim is that the Amish are
the healthiest and they don't get
vaccinated so therefore obviously if
they're not getting vaccinated and
they're the healthiest ipso facto QED it
must be the vaccinations are terrible
for you
how many of you buy into that
how many you buy into the idea that the
Amish are first of all not vaccinated do
you believe that and then second of all
that that's the Clear Connection to
their Better Health
I'm going to take that as just obvious
and true
yeah a little bit of an indecision today
a little bit of disagreement that's
exactly what I want all right here's
what I learned this morning
many Amish people are vaccinated
were you aware of that
now I'm not talking about the Covenant
vaccination I'm talking about the
childhood vaccinations but they're not
all vaccinated
and they don't take all of the
vaccinations
but I'm told at least online by people
who seem to know that they're fairly
highly vaccinated
right maybe not as much as a regular
public but fairly vaccinated
so
um the theory
on one website for why there's less
cancer diabetes autism and every other
problem in the world is that the Amish
are more active
they eat a cleaner diet but then I heard
a genetic argument
here's a genetic argument
now I hadn't heard this before but I
have to admit I did think about it I
thought about it but I didn't want to
say it because I couldn't you know
demonstrate it in any way but the
argument goes like this
um the Amish are less
genetically diverse
you know because they keep to themselves
and you know mate with people within
their group so they're less genetically
diverse than most of the world
if you're less genetically diverse
that's your design
is Destiny
what do you get with a group of people
who are genetically more similar
than other groups what does that design
guarantee that you're going to get
guarantee there's a hundred percent
chance
it guarantees that they'll have
different outcomes
right and one of the different outcomes
very easily could be there would be more
susceptible to some types of medical
problems would you agree so for example
they might have bleeding problems
something like that but at the same time
if they're little in group didn't have a
lot of cancer in the natural group they
weren't really susceptible then they
would end up breeding a group of people
who also didn't get cancer
because you know there are a lot of
humans just in general
who live their whole life lived to 100
and never get any cancer
but imagine if you had a small group of
people who just had something in common
they start mating with each other and
they don't mate with anybody else
they would probably be really
susceptible to some diseases
and then maybe really not susceptible
just some other common ones
so you could easily see that they
wouldn't have you know maybe depression
and cancer
but if you looked into it more deeply
you'd find out they have you know
pituitary gland problems or some damn
thing right so one possibility is we're
not looking at all of the disease field
we're sort of concentrating on the big
ones and just genetically maybe they
just have some defense against that no
that would just be a coincidence and but
but the one thing you can know from the
design
that if they're sticking to themselves
they should have a very different
disease profile than the rest of the
world would you would you buy that
general statement
that the Amish should by design of
sticking to themselves
have a different disease profile than
the rest of the world guaranteed I would
say that's guaranteed now I don't know
that that explains
what we're seeing is just would have to
be true
and I think the uh the clean food and
remember I said yesterday that I
predicted that sometime in our near
future you'll see stories that say uh oh
the the secret sauce was physical
activity
and that everybody who is physically
active was just as healthy as the Amish
all right let me make that claim I'm
going to make that claim right now
are you ready for this here's my
prediction
someday we'll find out
that everybody who is physically is
active as the Amish
has roughly the same medical outcomes
that's my claim
if we because we don't measure that do
we when was the last time you saw the
poll of uh what diseases people got
relative to how active they were during
the day and by active I just mean you
know cleaning the house taking a walk
just not sitting in front of a screen
for too many hours
I don't know that's my that's my
prediction active physical activity and
it's based largely on how it makes me
feel personally
I know that all the days when I have
physical activity I don't have any bad
feelings
it just eliminates anxiety depression
you know unwanted thoughts
like all of it so how in the world could
that not be
NPC jester
well even though you say you're an NPC
jester
I do have to hide you on this channel
for using all caps
all right so a story and Wall Street
Journal by Jason Riley
because it's a story about black
economic progress I will tell you that
if I can judge from the the little
drawing
he looks like a black American
so that's just context because he's
going to be talking about Black
Americans and I think he needs to know
that when somebody talks about Black
Americans you should know are they black
Fair
I think that's fair because there are
different perspectives
so uh what Jason Riley says is uh
essentially that people are overlooking
the tremendous economic progress of uh
Black Americans and uh I'll just give
you a little slice of me here that's
pretty impressive between 1963 and 2012
unemployment averaged uh 5.1 percent for
whites but 11.1 for blacks
uh the 28 financial crisis uh you know
we have blacks harder but then under uh
President Obama black unemployment
declined didn't fall below double digits
until the seventh year of his presidency
but when he left office in 2017 the
black jobless rate was 7.5
so that's pretty impressive from over
11.
then under President Trump Adept a 5.3
in 2019.
and then it fell to a record low of 4.7
in April of this year
how come nobody was reporting that
are you kidding me that in
2012 the average black unemployment rate
was 11 and that was 4.7
how is that not like the biggest cause
of you know celebration for the black
community of all time
that's kind of amazing
but you know what's even better than
this
this is like really good news do you
know it's way better
are you ready for this way better news
a hundred percent of the people who did
the right thing got a job
every one of them
100 of the people who did the right
things which are obvious you know stay
out of jail stay off drugs show up for
work develop some skills stay in school
a 100 percent of all the black people
who did those things got a job
so did everybody else
so we're at a point now where we can
just say
well let's forget about tracking black
unemployment separately
it is it doesn't really make sense
anymore
what you should track is people doing
the right thing
well once again a hundred percent of the
people who did the right thing got a job
but do you care if the people who know
what they should do
and then they don't do it are unemployed
what problem are you solving there
oh I'd like to get a job for the person
who's clearly not qualified for a job
is that a solution
and how can you force people to make
different decisions
I mean it's a free country they can
certainly make themselves unprepared for
a job
they have the freedom to do that so
whether you're black or white or any
other color
shouldn't we just be looking at the
people doing the right things and then
the people are not doing the right
things make sure they know what the
right things are you know maybe help
them get a leg up if there's some
problem doing the right things I'd like
to help them
but we should just be looking at people
doing the right things versus people not
and this whole race thing it's time to
retire it
so
I'll tell you I have a very contrarian
feeling about the affirmative action
decision by the Supreme Court
the the contrarian opinion is this is
wildly good for black Americans to get
rid of affirmative action for the
obvious reason that it was this giant
stain
uh you know floating above the black
brand in America right if your brand
is suffering that you all suffer from it
because you get you know the stigma from
it and everything
um but now that the affirmative action
stain is removed
then finally the free market can do us
like
so if you see a black person succeeding
and you know five years from now you're
going to say to yourself holy
there's somebody who maybe succeeded
against even greater greater odds
definitely want to hire that person
give me that person
so I I don't think people have quite
processed that while in the short run is
very bad for you know a bunch of
individuals who might have gotten into
that college or whatever so it might be
really bad probably won't be because I
think the colleges will just adjust and
figure out some way around the the law
but
I I think we just need to retire the
um black white
tracking
it's just time to lose it
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the best live stream you've
seen today
and
uh
the difference between the Mennonites
and the oh interesting
10 percent of Stanford freshman class is
white
somebody say is that true
I think what will happen is the higher
institutions will just um
degrade in reputation because if they're
not if they're not accepting people on
on Merit
what does what is their degree worth
it's not Merit
why do I care that you went to Stanford
what what possible Advantage would that
be if it's not based on Merit
um
the gay brand is stained you say
you know
the the trouble with the if you want to
call it the gay brand is that the lgbtq
brings in too many different groups
I'm not the first one to say that
but uh I would think if you're just the
the G in lgbtq you're not terribly happy
about the trouble that the t's are
causing
am I wrong I mean you might be
philosophically you know 100 backing
them but it's also true that they're
causing you problems because they're you
made them part of your brand you know so
if you're if you're gay and you're
identifying with the Trans community
uh nobody did that to you
right that's that was a somewhat of a
voluntary branding and because the T
part of the lgbtq is let's say more
provocative
yeah in today's world just being gay
doesn't buy you anything
you're not even interesting anymore at
least it used to be interesting if you
were gay now gay is just an ordinary
that it just doesn't really mean
anything anymore so
but the T
is still getting a lot of attention
right the trans so the extent to which
they allow themselves to be you know
painted with that same brush when it's a
very different situation
uh it's probably a mistake
but what do you do about it now
all right
um
sharing is it weird to me okay I don't
want to hear about that
all right everybody I'm going to say bye
to the YouTubers
thanks for joining I'm going to talk to
the locals people privately because well
they're worth it bye for now you
