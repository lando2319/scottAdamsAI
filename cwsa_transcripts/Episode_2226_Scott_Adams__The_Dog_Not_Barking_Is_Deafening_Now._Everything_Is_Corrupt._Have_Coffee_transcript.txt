good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
think it's fair to say you've never had
a better time
and just wait to see how much better it
gets it's gonna be crazy
crazy
if you'd like to take it up a level that
nobody's ever seen all you need is a cup
of mug or a glass a tanker Chelsea style
and a canteen jogger flask of vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day thing it makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sympathic
happens now go
ah
you know
I shouldn't tell you this before I
actually do it
but yesterday I
wrote a gigantic hit song in my head
I know I know I know what you're
thinking
a lot of people try to write you in
songs don't they
but has anybody ever written a song
using hypnosis
uh I'll bet not
and I realized that I could do a song
that would have the stickiest hook in
the world and that I could build it
around a hypnotic induction so that
while you were listening to the song you
would feel a tickle
you would actually physically feel the
song
and so I thought if I write that song
it's going to be the biggest hit in the
entire world
so I'm going to work on that later and
and let me confess I don't have any
songwriting talents
but I can write lyrics that will be
hypnotic
so I'm going to do that
a lot of drum beat to it you'll love it
well I saw a story that Jimmy Fallon is
getting some heat from his staff
for being a hard place to work
here's what you need to know about this
story
about Jimmy Fallon and his staff
it's about a public figure
that's all you need to know once I tell
you it's about a public figure you can
be absolutely sure it's fake now it
doesn't mean that none of the it doesn't
mean that every allegation is fake
but it's so out of context
that it's useless right so when you see
something like that the staff says
somebody did something
do you think it was the happy staff
members who were saying that
do you think it's every one of them
every one of them having the same
experience
do you think it's like every other
workplace in the world
where there are some people who believe
that he's insulting them when he's just
sort of living
I don't know
no way to know what's happening but I
will tell you for sure you shouldn't
believe anything about the story
you shouldn't leave his version and you
definitely shouldn't believe his staff
it's just something that happened that
you don't know about that should be the
story hey something happened and there's
no way you'll ever know what it was
that's it that's the whole story
well I saw a clip of Russell Brand going
full-throated in his uh
appreciation and endorsement of trump
specifically over the Ukraine war not um
not about other things but it's funny
watching Russell Brand just say it as
directly as you possibly can he's the
only one who's talking about the war
correctly I don't think that's right I
think you know Vivek and some others are
talking about it correctly but uh
certainly Trump's the biggest
you know the loudest voice
and
we'll see if that makes it it's just I
think it's uh
it's interesting when you see somebody
come that far
come all the way from you know being
left leaning to
you know being fully full-throated in
support of trump on the biggest issue
which is the war
uh Bobo no wants to make sure that I'm
bad at
um
a pattern recognition
so let me help you with your pattern
recognition
um let's see all lawyers went to college
almost almost every lawyer went to
college
all right so everything else you said is
dumb as
because some people like school and then
they do well because they go to school
so when people do well because they go
to school
that's not a massive Jewish plot
have you heard about the massive
Vietnamese American plot
where they go to school and get good
grades
probably because they want Vietnam to
run the world is that what you think
all right well
uh
uh I'm just going to make these people
go away because I want you to realize
how stupid you are before you go away
your entire world view is based on being
bad at pattern recognition
the pattern recognition is not that some
successful people are Jewish
that's the wrong pattern
it's the people who value in education
are successful
how are you missing that
like how is that not really really
obvious to you like how how anti-semitic
do you have to be before you think the
pattern is that they're Jewish
did anyway
all right uh so I guess the governor of
New Mexico is suspending the Second
Amendment
what
I think this is actually happening the
governor of New Mexico is going to have
a 30-day ban on open and concealed
carrying of guns
um which
a lot of people say is a violation of
the Second Amendment
I'm sure she would say
blah blah blah it's not
but uh I think this is going to cause a
little uh consternation I wouldn't trust
a 30-day ban on anything would you
who would trust a 30-day ban on guns
no
there will be no 30-day bans on guns if
the public has anything to say about it
yeah we'll see where that goes
uh
this is almost almost beyond belief and
Elon Musk has weighed into this but the
California Assembly they voted in favor
of this new bill
that would
essentially
say that the parents have to affirm
the gender of the child so if the child
says they're a different gender than the
parent the parent has to agree and if
they don't they'll lose custody
they could lose custody
so if there's a divorce
the one who affirms that the child knows
what their gender is is the one who gets
to keep the kid
that is demonic yeah
you know I've been resisting
the people who say they're that's actual
evil but what is this
what the hell is this how in the world
is this political it's not political and
it's not even Medical
it's not rational medical or political
it's not even wrong it's just evil
uh
so
you know musk is a
fighting fighting against that I think
he said he would move the com his
companies out of California he's got
you know there's one near me so there's
a big Tesla facility sort of bicycle
distance in that direction so there's a
lot of facilities here
um so he's making some threats he's also
Elon Musk is also
um taking legal action against
California
because California wants a law that
mandates the social media platforms
disclose their content removal policies
especially about hate speech and the way
Elon Musk is interpreting this
is that things which would be allowed
under free speech
would possibly not be allowed in
California
so so California wants to you know
violate the constitution according to
that view
and New Mexico wants to violate the
constitution according to guns
and if you notice it's always Democrats
violating the Constitution
feels like and when the Republicans do
it it's fake
we'll talk about that later when
Republicans accused of doing it it's not
even real
but it looks like it's happening on both
sides if you didn't know any better
all right here's my segment I call fake
news on fake science and you don't even
have to read the science
I'm going to tell you the headline of
this study you tell me if you would
believe anything it says
just the headline
kids do better in school when they can
see trees
kids do better in school when they can
see trees therefore
adding trees to any environment would
give you a better result
do you think that anything else might be
correlated with the trees
is there anything else hmm
is there any other variable that would
be highly correlated with trees
probably probably everything
yeah probably everything is correlated
with whether you have trees
like your income you know the
demographics the you know you have
basically everything
you know Health in general
so I wouldn't even bother reading that
report
here's another one why scientists cannot
be cannot be trusted with numbers
scientists are good until they try to do
math with money
so there's a new study that says that
nuclear power is way too expensive
now how far did I have to dig into it to
find out what they did wrong
not very far like it was like I don't
know for a sentence or something but
basically they take the approach that
the way nuclear has always been built in
the past
which is primarily through the extreme
uh reluctance of the government and
environmental groups that if that same
situation persisted
where people such as the people probably
writing this report when if you have
immense uh irrational opposition to it
it's not economical
guess what
you know what else would fall into that
category absolutely everything
you could pick any any industry randomly
and say all right let's take this
industry with that was doing fine but
we're going to put extreme extreme uh
political public pressure on it to not
do anything and not produce a product
and we'll put everything on it we'll
make it we'll make them take 20 years to
produce one unit of whatever their
product is how would that industry look
economically it would look pretty bad it
would look pretty bad how about an
industry where somebody decided they
were going to make a consumer product
but everyone would be different
so they could never get any economies to
scale
that wouldn't look like a good idea
would it
but suppose
you looked at any industry that had low
barriers because the government was
being helpful instead of you know being
bad
and that the public wasn't pushing on
them and that you can make everyone the
same
in that case good economics
so when people study the economics and
the I think RFK Jr has this problem as
well when you study the economics of
nuclear if you're studying how it was
done in the past
you're not really studying the economics
of nuclear you get that right because we
wouldn't do it that way
and if we tried to do it that way that
would in fact be a mistake
it probably would be a mistake to try to
build a new Nuclear Plant
with the current set of constraints
so change the constraints because the
constraints of the problem not not the
economics of the business
if we had a government
which could remove the constraints or
maybe have you know one way to do it
would be have a federal set of
requirements and then approve let's say
a modular set of components so that
anybody who does these same modular
pieces you know the important parts will
get pretty much automatic approval
because it's sort of pre-approved
now do you think that they studied a
world in which the government had
pre-approved
some some designs
so that everybody could just use them no
of course not of course they didn't so
anytime you see a a political political
item
where somebody studied the math and said
oh this won't pencil out they're never
doing it right
a a public news item about the economics
of something
probably never true
probably never because they're all
motivated you know all these reports are
motivated
why are you promoting conspiracy
theories
in all caps why are you drinking for
lunch
I would ask you in return
here's a fog of War update how often do
I tell you that if the topic is war the
first report is false
so this is about uh
um starlink and
Elon Musk whether or not he turned off
Skylink when the ukrainians were
planning an attack now apparently this
was not recent this was a year ago or
whatever it was and the ukrainians were
going to send their drone Fleet to sink
the entire Russian or a lot of it in
Port
and they they here's the part that we
didn't know the ukrainians thought they
had coverage so if you take that part
out the story is different and that's
the part we just learned
so they thought they had coverage so
they started to mount an attack which
they were really excited about only to
realize they didn't
and then they asked they asked Elon to
turn on that portion and he said
um I'm not going to be part of a major
attack on Russia
which I believe was the right call
that they basically asked them to be a
combatant essentially
uh part of the attack
and I I think he wisely said well maybe
I could be part of the defense but I'm
not going to be part of an attack on you
know what looks like Russia proper to
Russia
so
so he was in trouble for that he's in
trouble for everything else and um
could do you think it would be fair to
say at this point that the Democrats are
trying to put Elon Musk in jail
that's what it looks like
I feel like they're trying to put him in
jail like actually in jail and they
don't and it looks like they don't care
what what they use to do it
yeah that's what it looks like so I
think in these cases you can say that
that it's exactly what it looks like
so whenever there's a lack of
transparency
just assume it's exactly what it looks
like and that's exactly what it looks
like it looks like Republicans are being
hunted in a variety of ways and this is
more of that this is the big whale he's
the Moby Dick
so to speak
um
um all right
so there's a report that prosecutor fani
Willis
uh is corrupt
so
so some of the cases you know the
January 6 cases have to do with these
so-called fake electors
now if somebody was going to pretend
they were the legitimate electors
that would look pretty bad
wouldn't it
now turns out that's not the case but it
would look really bad if somebody was
going to pretend they were the
legitimate electors
and then say Oh we really want and we're
the legitimate ones and then just take
over the country that that way
so it turns out that fonnie had in her
possession
documents that show that the people who
are doing the so-called fake elector
thing
knew that they were not real electors
and and their intentions clearly stated
were that they were not going to be fake
electors they were going to be sort of
like back up in case just to hold the
right
in other words it was a placeholder
in case needed they were they were not
meant to be Replacements they were
alternates an alternate is somebody if
things go the way you want them to they
could be your alternate they were not a
replacement for
a replacement for would look like an
insurrection
alternates while you sort out what's
real
looks like just being prepared for all
outcomes it turns out that funny had
documents they showed that the so-called
fake electors were always meant to be
alternates and they said in direct words
they were not trying to be The
Replacements directly
so they're being charged with the thing
that the documents clearly show they
were not trying to do
they were trying to do something legal
and not that thing they're being charged
with and so she she apparently
didn't talk about it or suppressed it so
that you wouldn't know that is obvious
they're innocent it's obvious they're
innocent like super super obvious
they're innocent and decided just not to
tell you
now
at what point do you have a prosecutor
arrested
shouldn't she be arrested for that
if it's known that she knew that this
was uh would have freed them immediately
and she suppressed it shouldn't she be
in jail already
she should be in jail right
am I talking like a partisan or is that
just common sense
so I guess I guess I'll put the fog of
War standard on this one as well it
could be
that she has a reason for what she did
I haven't heard a reason yet but based
on the based on what we've seen so far
it would look like she's just a criminal
that's what it looks like it looks like
she's just a criminal
um
but we'll see
you know I tweeted this uh yesterday but
I liked it so much I'm going to read it
that when Republicans are wrong
about anything
that's the whole story
oh they're wrong you know when it
happens nobody nobody's right all the
time right but when Republicans are
wrong they're just sort of wrong
there's nothing else to say
but when Democrats are wrong
most of the time it's because their own
team ran a sophisticated op to brainwash
them
but here's the thing I've never met a
Democrat who's aware of that
have you
I've never met a Democrat who is aware
that their own team runs serial hoaxes
on them
you know they don't work as well on the
Republicans because Republicans know
what's happening but the Democrats seem
to be completely unaware that their team
is running Ops on them
that's not happening on the Republican
side is it
or or am I so deeply into my own bubble
that I can't see is happening on both
sides but to me it looks like it only
happens on one side
and the reason would be that only one
side controls enough of the media that
you could come up with an OP that the
media will support
right
if the if the Republicans tried to come
up with that kind of an OP it would live
in just the Democrat world and even some
of them would reject it
right
so be no media to support it
yeah
so and but think about the fact that
you've never met a Democrat who's aware
that their own team runs Ops on them all
the time it's Non-Stop
just think about that the the the
amazing success of these this this
brainwashing is that they don't know
what's happening at all
it's really it's impressive in its own
way
speaking of uh
brainwashing I like to give you examples
of what I call tells for cognitive
dissonance
meaning that there are some people some
things that people do automatically when
you catch them in cognitive distance one
is the so tell
where you say the sky is blue and let's
say they always believed it wasn't and
they don't want to be embarrassed by
finding out it really is
they'll say so you're saying everything
in the world is blue
and you go what what everything that
everything that came after that word so
was ridiculous
so you're saying that nobody else can
have free speech no no no we're not even
talking about that
so you're trying to change the subject
no no I'm not saying you know so you
can't talk to anybody who does this so
as soon as you hear the word so
you can stop the conversation that which
is what I do I go well there's the so
tell
so we're done here
all right another one is word salad
right word salad oh before I get to that
one another one is what I call the well
the repeating well
you you've seen it when you debunk any
of the hoaxes it's like this is true
well here's some evidence showing it's
not true well okay maybe that's not true
but this is true well here's some
evidence showing that's not true okay
maybe those things aren't true but
here's some evidence showing a third of
things true here's some evidence showing
it's not what do they do then
start at the top
as if you'd never discussed it
always so that so if they go down the
well and you've debunked it all and then
they just start at the top like you
hadn't conversed
that's that's cognitive distance
but my favorite is the word salad word
salad it's a sentence that might make
sense in a grammar sense but if you look
at it in in context you'd say uh
what
so let me give you one so as you know
everybody who's observing except Sam
Harris knows that he's experiencing some
kind of mental
uh
phenomenon it looks like cognitive
dissonance to anybody who's studied it
but here's what he said that to me looks
like word salad
so he was talking about January 6 and
Trump and how dangerous Trump is right
so here's a sentence he actually spoke
to Russell Brand quote
that was such a dangerous desecration of
our political landscape that I should
think it should make it impossible
to support Trump
so you saw January 6. that was such a
dangerous desecration of our political
landscape
that I think it should make it
impossible to support to Trump
just look at that sentence
do I do I even say need to say more
things have real problems you can stay
at the sentence that everybody
understands and agrees with
increasing the amount of money that we
print
will will increase inflation
was that word salad
no no the war in Ukraine risks
um
escalating to a nuclear war
was that word salad
you all understood that right because
that's a real opinion right
children should not be making gender
choices because their brains are not
developed
did everybody understand that I think
you did right you could disagree but you
understood the point
or how about somebody says I disagree
with abortion because in my opinion it's
a living thing and life is precious
is anybody confused no you're not
confused about that at all not at all
right were the elections uh rigged or
not rigged
some say rigged they give their reasons
some say not rigged they give their
reasons is anybody confused
no
no you could everything that's a real
opinion about a real thing
can be expressed in very simple words
if you end up with a dangerous
desecration of our political landscape
that means you're you're completely in a
theoretical word based World in which
you're trying to make words
fit together
to match your preconceived opinion yeah
this is classic word salad
and everybody except Sam Harris would be
aware of that and as he heard me
describe it which you probably won't
because I don't think he pays attention
to the social media but if he heard me
describe it would say my God no I have
real reasons let me tell you the good
reasons too
so it's always the thing with cognitive
dissonance is that the person who's
experiencing it is the only one who
can't have any Vision on whether it's
happening by definition they're the ones
who don't know
so that's my
opinion on that
um
so
here's a tweet that I made yesterday
we're at pretty pretty early after I got
off
uh live stream
um
and I'm going to get it's sort of a
three-parter
and I said this I said it's
mind-boggling that half of the country
believes trespassing in one building is
how you conquer a superpower
because who said so
and then I said it's almost as
incredible as the fact that no one has
interviewed any of the international
people who allegedly wanted that
Ukrainian prosecutor fired as much as
Joe Biden did
have you heard me say that before
Biden keeps saying but but these
International entities they wanted and
fired and I kept saying
so why don't we talk to them
why does nobody talked to him
well there's that dog
why is he not barking the most important
fact
the most important fact in the world
is whether that claim is true
it's the most important fact in the
world right now because that's the fact
that keeps the president in office
that's a fact that would determine
whether his competitor could win whoever
that is
that's a fact that describes
everything we know about the situation
it's the fact that would unlock the
Rosetta Stone of corruption so you can
actually understand what happened you
know without the news spin
it may be a fact that's determining that
we're in a war which is destroying our
economies it might create a nuclear war
is by far the most questioned is it true
that other you know serious people
wanted him fired
so after I said that and I noted it's
the same thing about the fine people
hoax nobody nobody went to talk to the
Fine people to find out if Trump was
right that there were some non-racists
there
who just wanted the statues now turns
out I did I actually asked on Twitter
are there any fine people who disavow
racists who attended the event
some of them contacted me and so I
talked to them and I'm convinced they're
real people who in one case were locals
and they just heard something was going
on about the statues and they wandered
down and they were in favor of keeping
them
and they said uh Nazis we ain't Nazis
but we like statues
so did you notice that no one else in
the entire media landscape
went went and said hey were there you
find people there because that was a
major claim in fact Biden ran on that
hoax so knowing that knowing the answer
to the question were there any people
who were non-racists
who were there just for the statues was
the most important question and nobody
ever asked it except me
nobody
in the world I'm the only one who asked
the question and was the most important
question which probably even got Biden
elected
so back to the other one about the
Ukrainian prosecutor shoken
today I wake up to find that the news
says
um and I saw this on a
uh Miranda is it Divine I don't want to
say divine right
not Devine
yes Divine so Miranda Divine was uh
writing and I saw kanikoa the Great
retweeting that the European commission
praised Ukraine's prosecutor Victor
Ashokan for his efforts to fight
corruption in a December 2015 progress
report published nine days after
nine days after VP Joe Biden demanded
disaster
so the entity that he says agreed with
him
strikingly disagreed
even after he said it
they disagreed in writing
did you ever see that reported
have any of you ever seen that in the
news before today
Loop now let me ask you this is it a
coincidence that I tweeted this and then
it showed up in the news within hours
oh
foreign
I don't know but it's the most important
question in the world
now would you agree it's the most
important question in the world
because everything makes sense
once you know that it was never true
because that also allows you to
understand which news entities are
corrupt
because any news entity
that was incurious about that question
is corrupt
or completely incompetent I guess
am I right
did did you ever hear anybody even ask
the question have you checked with those
other people because this entire story
the entire story forever has depended on
those other people and nobody ever
talked to them you know but I guess it
was some news report that could be
pulled out
yeah
how mind-blowing is that that the most
important question in the world the
entire media appeared to be completely
incurious about
but I'll give Miranda Devine a the
credit in the New York Post because they
were curious enough to go get the answer
and the answer was it was a lie
according to this
do you think this will be all over CNN
today that the most important fact that
we've ever seen in a year probably just
became clear
no no no because Democrats will never
learn
that what they think is the news has
always been brainwashing Ops on them a
little bit on us too but mostly they're
brainwashing their own team
uh
here's the question do you think you're
the atom of simulation Theory
as an Adam and Eve
that's a weird little
weird little uh coincidence
all right uh here's another thing that
Democrats don't know but you do
and so you know Elon Musk again is
having a battle with the ADL
now here's what we know
because we pay attention but others
don't that the ADL may have had some
Noble purpose in the past I'm going to
give them benefit of a doubt but at the
moment they're just a Democrat organ
that the Democrats use to smear their
opponents that's all it is and they but
because either people don't know or
don't care
uh apparently the media has
formed behind them and now there are a
bunch of headlines about how uh Elon
Musk is attacking this wonderful ADL so
I guess he must be an anti-semite
because he's going after the gay deal
now if you were a Democrat
you would think this is true
but it's an OP
this this is obviously the ADL obviously
got their media friends to write
articles saying that the ADL is right
and Elon Musk is wrong do you know why
because if their friends didn't write
that they would give smeared for being
anti-Semitic
the ADL largely controls the news
because they'll just call you
anti-semitic even if it's unrelated to
the topic they'll find a reason to call
you anti-semitic if you report things
they don't like they being the Democrats
now if you didn't know that
you would think that Elon Musk is acting
sketchy by being against somebody who's
against defamation
that and that's what their Democrats
would see
no dick it's not about the tribe it's
about Democrats
who controls the ADL one guy one guy
controls the ADL
do you know Israel doesn't like the ADL
right
so those of you who are saying oh this
is the ADL it's all part of the Jewish
conspiracy don't you think that
Benjamin Netanyahu don't you think that
he would be on the same side
if there was a major Jewish conspiracy
that the ADL would be part of
Israel is not a big fan of the ADL for
the same reason that I'm describing
they're not they're not a credible
organization and they certainly don't
make Israel look good
so you're going to have to work on your
conspiracy theories
you're gonna have to you could have to
explain why you think Israel
wants open borders the dumbest
thing anybody ever thought in their life
you know so you think they're all
backing Soros in his open borders
because Israel itself would be better
off with open borders that's your theory
that's your Theory
like you should at least have a
conspiracy theory which sticks together
a little bit
right if your Jewish conspiracy theory
doesn't include
Israel
then you probably have a problem with
your theory
all right enough about that
um Mike Lindell is being a hero he's uh
he's being uh what do you call it uh
deposition he was doing a deposition in
which the lawyer uh
referred to him as taking customer
complaint calls
and he characterized it as people
complaining about lumpy pillows
well let me tell you
you can call Mike Lindell
uh you know names
you can say you can say that he's crazy
you can say he's a conspiracy theorist
you can say
many things about him
but don't make fun of his pillows
that was a line too far and there's a
funny clip of him calling the lawyer an
 over and over again which I
could just watch all day long
because
the lawyer was an there was
nothing about this deposition
which should have mentioned lumpy
pillows because it's not in evidence and
have nothing to do with anything it was
just a way to defame him
in case the you know it was just another
way to defame it basically so it was a
uh a very bad behavior
and he just went after them it was fun
so I'm going to buy two more pillows
I'm going to buy two I've got a couple
I'm gonna buy two more my pillows to
reward him for his bad behavior because
anytime somebody calls their lawyer an
 during a deposition my first
question is what are you selling I think
I did two of them
so we're gonna buy two pillows sometime
the next day or two
other good pillows yeah and by the way
that the the design of the my pillow it
can't possibly be lumpy by design it
wouldn't even be bought it wouldn't even
be a possibility so I can see why you
would be mad about that word these are
not lumpy pillows they will hold their
form
and you know there's a lot of personal
preference but if if your personal
preference
is like a nice firm pillow
they're very good very good pillow I can
say for sure that these are way above
average pillows I haven't tried every
pillow in the world but they're good
pillows
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the stories that interested me the
most did I miss anything
Good's story anything uh
juicy that I
soft Landing to talk about the economy
you know I I do not understand what's
going on with the economy
if anybody does
because
every part of it appears to be something
that's you know ready to fall apart but
at the same time was it Krugman who said
that people don't know that inflation is
coming down or has come down or
something
do you believe that
does it feel to you like inflation came
down
doesn't feel at the grocery store
a restaurant
gas
I think my health club is the same price
I quit but if I went back it'd be the
same price rent would be up housing
would be up
furniture will be up
insurance would be up energy would be up
what is he talking about
I don't know anything that isn't up just
maybe a few consumer items right that's
about it
yeah
so even even something like a inflation
measurement you can't even trust that
all right let me tell you which things
I'm good at predicting and what I'm not
so this is what I've learned on my own
I'm terrible at predicting
normal politics so a question there was
who would be Trump's vice president I
would call that normal politics
because has to do with a lot of things
happen behind the scenes so I will
always be bad
at predicting who somebody will pick as
a vice president and have been bad in
the past so I have don't listen to me
when I say vice president picks also bad
on anything that's purely political
because I don't have much insight to
that the the places that I do well
are spotting
as I did with the uh the shoken thing
as I did with the fine people as I did
with the
um drinking bleach Oaks so I'm really
good at spotting
you know I was the first one I think
probably the first one to call out that
the secret of Sonic weapon
was
yeah as soon as the uh the UFO came out
most of you were on the same page but it
didn't take me long to say and
sure enough we're not seeing any aliens
right so if I tell you something's
I think I have at least a 80 record
would you agree
if you've been watching me for a while
would you say I'm about 80 percent right
when I call out something that's not
true
yeah I think it's 90 but I'm going to
give you 80.
um but what is a purely political thing
would you also agree that I'm not so hot
on that God don't have any I have no
insight into that whatsoever
now
I do have a tech so another category
would be technology
and I don't know what my record is on
technology but my but there's one we can
test uh I I'm one of the early people to
say
the AI will be underwhelming
underwhelming and I think that's
contrarian
so at least the the current version is
just going to be a cool tool that only
people who take the time to learn how to
use the tool or get to use which means
that people will use it in the context
of their job
but not much else
so it'll be as transformative as the
laser printer and
you know uh let's see when dos became
you know visual it's going to be sort of
like that so it'll certainly make things
look and feel different certainly your
customer interactions with companies
should be greatly improved I've had a
few experiences of getting you know a
good high functioning AI
in fact I had this the other day I got
an AI instead of a person
but it wasn't one of these stupid phone
trees that never work where you're
trying to work through the phone tree it
was just a conversation it just asked me
questions and I answered them I knew it
was Ai and it worked
it got it got me all the way to a final
result it was very good now stuff like
that will happen
stuff like that will happen but that's
not really transformative it's not going
to end Society
I don't see the AI breaking people's
passwords yet
I don't you know wasn't it supposed to
break all our passwords by now
so
so you can test this one
so my
my prediction is the AI is uh
oh my somebody says my hardcover Edition
got fixed on Amazon
it wasn't fixed this morning
when I got in this morning it wasn't
fixed spell but I'll check that out
all right uh
great book
well let me tell you tell you again that
my
um
the reviews
for reframe your brain are amazing it
definitely is the best book I've written
in terms of usefulness
so I would I have this following claim
here's my claim there's no book on
improving your life
that gives you more value in a simpler
form
it's the highest value
in the the simplest effort you really
just read the sentence basically just
read the sentence some of them will work
for you and some of them will be
irrelevant but that's my claim there's
no book in the world
ever
they gave you this much benefit with
this much little effort
that's a big claim but if if you see the
people going by who have read the book
They're saying oh yeah that's true
right there's nobody who's disagreeing
with it who actually read it nobody
just think about how big the claim is
I just said it was like the most useful
book ever a ridiculous claim
for the little amount of time you put
into it and there's not a single person
who read it who's disagreeing I'm
watching more comments on the locals
platform
but just think about that how
extraordinary that is
can it fix brain damage Maybe
depends how you it depends how you
define the damage
um
so I guess uh Apple is working on their
own Ai and they're putting massive
amounts of money into it
um here's the first option there's still
workbooks yeah
uh there's no hardcover okay so no the
hardcover hasn't been fixed so you might
be you might be somebody I think
somebody just noted that it's not fixed
one of the problems is that it would be
fixed and then unfixed
you just bought the hardcover
well it does show up but it shows up
second
so it shows the fake one first the last
I checked I'll check again
but my old publisher did say they were
going to take it down but it might take
a few days
six weeks oh does it show not available
when it is
all right
um
rumor the Apple might buy Disney oh I
haven't heard of that that doesn't sound
real
the Apple might buy Disney
I don't see that's real
that feels like the worst idea in the
world
seriously that's not the worst idea in
the world
those businesses don't belong together
that those are completely different
businesses
I can't imagine that Steve Jobs would do
that
Apple TV needs content
okay
so they're just buying a Content maker
for Apple TV
um
all right
I'll give you that I'll give you Apple
TV
Scott do you know donate to the ADL
seriously
who runs the ADL Scott
people that Benjamin and Netanyahu
doesn't like
are we done here
I mean seriously how many times
do I have to tell you the same thing
wow wow
all right I'll I'll even be more
striking you ready if you had to guess
who does the prime minister of Israel
Benjamin Netanyahu who do you think he
likes better
Jonathan Greenblatt the head of the ADL
or me
what do you think
gun to had if he had to pick one of
those people who do you think he would
pick as his favorite person of the two
of us it wouldn't even be close
does that give you any pause at all
about your theories
no now that he doesn't like green black
the ADL doesn't like Netanyahu
thinks it thinks he's too conservative
thinks he's too friendly to Trump
probably
all right
um
all right well you're being silly now
some beginning or all your comments
all right YouTube
you've gone down into the sewer so I
think we'll end this now and I will talk
to you tomorrow
