that design
which i know is weird because you're
thinking to yourself
i'll bet they're really good at design
look at all these good things they've
designed
such as the boxes
when you get an apple product
opening the box is a sensual delight
things just
slide and
peel in a very satisfying way and you
don't have to get a tool to cut anything
it's a really good experience and a lot
of the apple interfaces are quite
extraordinary but there are some things
they do
they're just a complete failure
and i'll show you a few
all right so here's here's an ipad
and
uh there's not much to it
so let's uh let's turn on the ipad
uh oh okay the i thought the power
button would be up in this corner
because it looks exactly the same
so it's not up in this corner but let's
turn on the ipad
okay it's not on this corner either but
i know one of these corners has the on
button so we'll keep looking for it here
we go here we go
no that was the volume button
here
no
okay
fourth try
do you know how much i hate this product
when it takes me four tries to find the
on off button
i hate it with a passion
i hate it
in a way you can't even exp you can't
even understand how much i hate
whoever did this
how hard would it be
to put some kind of indication that this
is the corner not only with the camera
but with the on off button
is that so hard
anything any any little indication here
anything would do it and i would not
have to try
two to four times
every time i use my device
right
complete failure of design
here's another one
let's uh let's plug in the power
all right it looks like i'm losing some
power
it's not that side
50 chance
it's not that side
but
it's only 50 chance so the other side
you know that's all
so you plug plug that in
you just plug that in
there
oh wait
it's the wrong connector
that's right
they changed the the connector is it's
not this one
no no it's this one
so
this one is the one you plug in
okay that's the wrong side
but i'll plug it in the right side
because apple's got that figured out
almost i'm almost there
you pieces of
let me let me explain to you how to
design this correctly okay
what you don't want
is a tiny little
fussy surface
and a tiny little fussy thing
that unless you get this
exactly exactly in that little hole
[Music]
it doesn't go in
so
for absolutely no charge
i'm going to give apple a little design
suggestion
and it's not really very hard
i'll do it with a piece of paper
let's say
i wanted to insert this object
into this hole
well that doesn't work too well does it
all right now how can i fix that
now watch
almost every
time yeah
just give us a little bit of a give us a
little bit of a slope
before you hit the hole
so that if you're trying to plug it in
and you miss
it guides you gently
right into the hole
now i know apple was pretty darn proud
when they came up with the idea of a
plug they could go in upside down or
right side up
that helps
it's not like the micro usbs have you
ever tried to plug in a micro usb
let me show you how a micro usb is
plugged in
you take your device this is not a micro
usb but it's a good demonstration and
you correctly find the hole
now with the micro usb it has to be
right side up
so you carefully look at the hole you
make sure it's right side up and you try
to put it in
and
it won't go in
and that's when you realize that you
actually have it upside down
so if it doesn't go in this way
only one other thing to do is you turn
it upside down you put it in
and that's when you realize
that now it's upside down
but before it was not upside down you
just didn't have it lined up so you turn
it back over
and you finally get it in
three tries minimum for micro usb
but apple
you could do almost anything except
exactly what you did and it would make
me happier really
but you see the choice they made
look how cool this looks
slick
space age
yeah
yeah
unless you break you drop it and then it
breaks
um do you think that apple can't make
glass
that won't break when you drop it
you think they can't do that
it's well beyond their capability
to make a screen that doesn't break
i think they can do it
but they don't
the other thing they do is they design
a great looking product
i mean look at this
i mean this is a beautiful product this
is the the iphone it's an older one
but look at those sleek lines oh this is
beautiful
except
if you were to use this without
a case
you would be what i call an idiot
because you're gonna drop it they even
make it slippery
it like falls right out of your hand
just slips out of your head so they make
it
slippery
handheld
and easily broken
that's what they designed
slippery
handheld
and easily broken
that's not even trying
really
that's not even trying and how about
waterproof
do you think they couldn't figure out
how to make these things waterproof
it took years to now it's like water
resistant a little bit and they're
pretty happy about that
no i'm pretty sure other companies
figured out the water resistant thing a
little faster
but here's the thing that bugs me they
build this beautiful product that is
absolutely useless unless you put a god
awfully
ugly cover on it
like this
and now
all of its design beauty
it's gone
it's completely gone
there was no reason to design this well
it was going to be in a case
just design it with the case
or make the glass not breakable one or
the other
so
this is my problem with apple they will
always choose
design excitement over function
and
i think we have to stop saying that it's
a good design company
because i'm not sure what good design
means to you but if it takes me
four tries
to find out where to plug in the
the power
or where to turn it on i'm not happy
i'm not happy so i'll tell you that my
experience with apple products is that
they piss me off every time i use them
because there's always something that
obviously they did to screw the consumer
and fool you into saying that's
beautiful i'll buy it not no not
thinking that it was going to be
worthless the way it's designed
yeah they designed things to screw
customers i mean apple also
fact-checked me on this but didn't they
design a phone that
they crippled with software so that
you'd buy the upgrade
i mean i think that happened right
give me a fact check on that but i think
that was confirmed
yeah gorilla glass apparently is one way
you could do this but
um
mercedes says the same thing
samsung isn't better about the case yeah
it's true
please please identify a product that
doesn't make me bad
hmm
oh
um well not my coffee warmer you want to
see the worst interface
here's like
people somebody should die for this
should be the death sentence for this
interface let me show you something
so you see my coffee warmer
let me plug it in
all right so
i come over here in the morning
and you see the red light tells me that
the power is not on so i want to power
on my coffee so i got a fresh cup of
coffee
i put that on there and i say let's turn
on the warmer
or no let's say
now let's try this
huh
okay it's not performing the way i
wanted it to but the point is
under normal use
when you turn it on sometimes
it just turns off in three seconds and
you don't realize it because you've
turned around so that's a complete fail
don't forget removed audio jacks but
didn't fix bluetooth audio latency
is there latency i don't really
i guess i do pick it up sometimes is
that what's happening
um
all right i just had i just wanted to
get on here and complain to apple
because seriously apple you're
you're just pissing off every single
person who uses an iphone ipad probably
every time they use it
probably every time they use it they get
angry like i do it's like
so that is my suggestion to apple
computer that's all i wanted to say
