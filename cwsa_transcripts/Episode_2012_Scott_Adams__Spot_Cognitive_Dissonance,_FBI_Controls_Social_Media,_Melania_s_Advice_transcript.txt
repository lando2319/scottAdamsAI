foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it gets
better every time you arrive here I
think you've noticed already have you
noticed it's like one percent better
than the day before every day until you
know a year goes by and you're like whoa
It's 365 better
I probably did the math wrong but you'd
probably be you know what I mean
and if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that no one has
ever experienced before all you need is
uh a couple of glass of tanker chalice
was dying a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine here
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
uh Steve Steve says my live streams are
mildly disappointing
but he can't help coming back anyway
now that's what I like to hear
I like to hear that I'm mildly
disappointing because that's that's my
sweet spot mildly disappointing I might
put that on my tombstone
he accomplished a few things
and yet he was mildly disappointing
have I told you my story about my guitar
amp breaking or did I imagine that
you know sometimes you imagine telling
the story
okay I told you that's right never mind
you won't hear it again
so I print I posted a photo of the
remains of my printer
after I had shattered it on my
hard floors of my office now the people
on the local Subscription Service saw me
do that live
which was unplanned
in case you're wondering no I did not
plan to lift my printer off my desk and
smash it on the ground in front of an
audience on live stream but I did but I
did and so I uh and by the way it's not
the first time
it's not my first printer
let's go private here on locals
so I don't forget it later
but a funny thing happened after I
posted my photo of the destroyed printer
on my floor
a lot of people said they've done the
same thing
you have to read the comments
the number of people who said They wish
they'd done it they felt good because I
did it or they've done it themselves
is sort of shocking
and I wonder what it would be like to be
like like a manufacturer of printers
to find out that people enjoy breaking
them on their floor more than they enjoy
using them
I don't know maybe something to work on
maybe something to work on
well at the Grammys there's still some
chattering about that I guess Harry
Styles won an award that some people
thought should have gone to Beyonce
should have gone to Beyonce
I wonder if there was anything missing
and this Grammys award ceremony it just
seems like
it would have been the perfect thing in
this situation what would you do if
Harry Styles won the award that you
believe
should have gone to Beyonce
where a slap where where was yay when
you need him
you tell me that the Grammys would not
but would not have been phenomenal
if at the moment
the Harry Styles was accepting his award
yea had come from backstage where you
didn't even know he was there he just
came up and said this award should have
gone to Beyonce like he did with
Taylor Swift
it would have been epic
it would have made it entertaining for
the first time
well I wish that happened but then Harry
Styles is getting in trouble today
because when he got his reward award
he said and I quote
that this doesn't happen to people like
me
uh oh
oh
at the same time people are thinking
that Beyonce should have gotten reward
his first words are this doesn't happen
to people like me like me now what did
he mean by that
what did he mean by that well obviously
that was interpreted as racist
because what he really meant According
to some black pundits is what he really
meant is it doesn't happen to white men
that white men don't win Awards
well that's the most white privileged
thing anybody ever said say his critics
now
how many of you believe that he was
thinking that white men don't win Awards
is there anybody here
who is that dumb
nobody right so I'd like you to remember
this story
that black Americans are criticizing
Harry Styles
uh and believing that he doesn't believe
right so it's not what Harry Styles
believes it's what his critics believe
he's thinking
what's that called
what's it called when you imagine you
can see the thinking of another person
that is unspoken oh mind reading mind
reading yeah mind reading
uh well uh Governor Greg Abbott of Texas
is gonna he's pushing for uh Banning
Tick Tock in Texas now Banning Tick Tock
in Texas means only government employees
and government devices or we're just
government devices actually
and
so this made me ask the following
question
what is the Biden crime family's
position on by on Banning tick tock
I don't believe I've heard have you
what was the last time Biden himself
as you know the chief of the Biden crime
family when was the last time somebody
asked him his opinion about banning tick
tock
have has anybody seen his opinion on
that at one point he could have gotten
away with were studying it right at one
point he said we're studying it
yesterday
Kevin says yesterday
oh literally yesterday
and oh he said he didn't know
all right that's that's what I was
looking for because the last I knew
he said he was studying it now you don't
think he studied it long enough
I mean maybe not personally but you
don't think anybody who advises him has
studied it
[Music]
you don't need to study it
do you
he said it's not on my phone oh God
that's so embarrassing to have him as
your president
so embarrassing
[Laughter]
he posted on Tick Tock that he's against
it yeah I don't think that happened but
that's funny all right well I think that
uh obviously the Biden crane family is
avoiding the topic because nobody
believes he doesn't have an opinion
do you believe that
do you believe that the president no
matter who the president is
Biden Trump or whoever is the next
president you believe they don't have an
opinion about whether Tick Tock should
be banned in America
yes they do
that's just lying so the Biden crime
family is lying about their opinion on
Tick Tock clearly clearly and obviously
so
the BC the BCF Biden crime family so I'm
going to be using that uh phrase because
at this point
they are I think the evidence is so
clear
that they're a criminal organization
that I don't know why I can't call them
the Biden crime family there's no
problem with that is it
I mean it seems it seems fair at this
point
well balloon gate never stops
the issue that should have been enough
almost nothing but isn't
um
and apparently the big question CNN is
asking is about the balloon flights
under Trump now Trump says we didn't
have any balloon flights but other
people say well
China had a few balloon flights over
maybe Alaska a little bit briefly but it
was you know no no security risk
so the president probably was never
informed so I think it's both true and
false at the same time
that there were balloon flights Over
America under Trump
it's true and that it technically
probably happened that this is just my
speculation probably happened but in
such a trivial way
that it did not rise to National
Security
um interest that sounds right doesn't it
yeah some are saying that they were
never detected under Trump we only know
about it now but that's not true that
can't be true
yeah I I'm pretty sure we detected it
because we tracked this one the entire
way right we tracked it all the way I'm
sure we tracked the other ones
yeah so to me it just sounds like a lie
to say that it didn't happen but I think
it did happen it was just trivial here's
the here's maybe the funnest story of
the day
so somebody somebody Miller has a book
out about the Trump Administration which
Miller is it
which Miller has the book what's his
first name
there's more than one Miller right
no I don't think it was Stephen
was it
oh
I thought there might be one more than
one Miller all right well it doesn't
matter for my point it doesn't matter
but the the story describes the
operation to kill Isis head baghdadi
baghdadi
they bagged that Daddy
oh they actually did he's a daddy and
they bagged him so they bagged that
Daddy and when it was happening
apparently Melania came into the
Situation Room
so the first thing you might say is what
why did why do you get a plus one for
the Situation Room
did you know the situation room was a
plus one situation well I guess bring a
date so Melania came and but the
funniest part is that you know I'm
setting you up
I'm setting you up for thinking that
Melania being there is a mistake right
so then she watches the operation with
the rest of them and baghdadi kills
himself with a explosive vest
and a big part of the story was they had
a dog a service dog what do you call it
a military dog of some kind who went in
and trapped baghdadi and you know then
Baghdad he blew himself up and at the
end of it when they were trying to
figure out how to essentially present it
to the public that they've done this
reportedly Melania said
that you should focus on the dog because
everybody likes dogs
you should focus on the dog because
everybody likes dogs
and then they did you know they gave the
dog an award and they talked about the
dog
and I just just think about how good
that device was
is that
no you know no kidding
Jokes Aside that's some of the best
that's some of the best political advice
I've ever seen in my life
that this is one of those stories that
makes you understand why they're a
couple right
because sometimes you go oh was it all
about the money you know whatever it is
but it does look like like they have a
an intellectual compatibility
because that was really smart and you
know you know Trump's gonna like
smart people
so that was a great story
um I was not aware that the Putin's
so-called girlfriend
um has several children with them I
don't know how many but also everybody
knows it's his girlfriend I wasn't aware
of that apparently just everybody knows
he has a girlfriend he's got some kids
with a girlfriend but she gave a speech
in Russia
in which he uh said that propaganda is
um a weapon of War like a kalishnikov
and that Russia is using that weapon of
propaganda
mostly within the country successfully
so she was basically giving a
pro-propaganda
message
yeah you know what's interesting about
that is it is just that it's transparent
it's not interesting that anybody
thought it
because of course everybody thinks their
own propaganda is good
but it is interesting that she cited out
loud yes we're a country that's lying
like crazy
but it's a really it's really useful
lies you know it's good for the war
okay I don't know I I don't have much to
say about that except that when
something honest happens it catches my
attention
I like to call it out
um I saw another tweet from Ken ocoa the
Great
who said you never guess from this
official Facebook video that was part of
the tweet that this guy was one of the
most senior people at the CIA until
2019.
so a person a man who is a senior person
at the CIA until as recently as 2019 is
who at Facebook is deciding what content
you see
you know what what gets censored and
what doesn't
let me say that again
the a senior Cia guy until 2019 which is
really recently
uh is who Facebook has hired
to decide basically what content is on
there and what isn't in terms of banning
people
now you already know that from the
Twitter files that Twitter was maybe
still is infested with ex-fbi
employees including
their top legal person who was an FBI
legal person
James Baker who who figures into some
other stories that involve the Democrats
now at this point it seems blindingly
obvious
that the FBI and CIA were trying to
manipulate
results
does anybody doubt that
does anybody have any doubt
that the CIA and the FBI were trying to
manage information within this country
no doubt same as Russia right so when
Putin's girlfriend says yeah we're doing
propaganda and it's great it's just like
weapons
that's what we do
and you know here's the problem
I don't want them not to do it
one of the things we don't really
appreciate is that propaganda is what
holds the country together
propaganda is what makes America a
country
that the moment you stop your propaganda
everything falls apart
there's a reason that we do the Pledge
of Allegiance
the Pledge of Allegiance is just
brainwashing
but it's the good God
it's a good guide but it is brainwashing
just you know to make people
uncritically accept their side but it's
good I wouldn't want anything else I
want people in this country to pretty
much uncritically prefer this country
over other
countries especially if you get in a war
right but there's a big big downside to
it and the big downside is they can do
propaganda that isn't good for the
country
so you know and that might be what's
happening so there's no right answer
here because you don't want to get rid
of all propaganda the country would just
fall apart
but you got to watch it
so here's what I would recommend I
believe that ex-employees of the FBI and
the CIA and there might be some other
organization should throw in there
should not be allowed to work at private
companies
that are in the business of helping the
public understand the world
or communicate so I don't think it
should be legal
for the Facebook or Twitter to have
hired ex-employees of the FBI or the CIA
now as a free country so you don't want
to have restrictions like that so I
might be willing I might I might
be willing to have full disclosure as
part of their you know annual uh
disclosures
so it would have been helpful for me to
know that people at Facebook or Twitter
in specific jobs right the specific job
matters I would like to know that they
came from those places
and that I could I could decide
I could decide whether that mattered to
me or not
my first choice is that they can't do it
at all
now I would you know sort of in the same
family of problems I also favor members
of congress not buying individual stocks
even though it's a free country
you know I I have a problem with that
it's not a it's not the greatest
law
because I don't like restricting what
people can do with their own money in a
free society that that seems it seems
creepy to me but on the other hand we
can't really trust them unless unless we
have some control over their Investments
control or or visibility
so
now I'm not actually I'm not actually
high
you're seeing me after seven hours of
sleep which is the first time
I've had seven hours of sleep
in a long time I don't know very long
time
but I but I pulled it off yeah not high
today at all
so but thanks for imagining us
so I don't think we'll ever see that law
but I'd like to see it I saw a tweet
today
from I think it's a black Minister based
on the profile picture who said on his
tweet raise your sons to be like George
Floyd not George Bush
raise your sons to be like George Floyd
not George Bush
okay I think I found the problem
I think I found the problem
um and here's how I would solve it
I think that part of systemic racism
watch what I do here watch the technique
the biggest part of systemic racism is
that black Americans
um
idolize criminals
they idolize criminals because George
Floyd was a criminal
so if you want to go after systemic
racism the two biggest elements of it
are uh for whatever reason black people
would have problems idolizing
people from other races
right
now I I find it very easily very easy to
idolize somebody from any race
right athletes musicians
scientists writers
yeah you show me a real successful black
man or woman or non-binary or whatever
you like
and they're they're killing it they're
doing a good job that's my role model
black role model absolutely
uh Asian American role model yes
yes thank you just heard about some
young Asian-American teenager who's just
killing it in school you know got a job
already with a startup he's just like
he's 15. just killing it role model yes
yes that kid high school kid Asian
American uh first generation you know
immigrant yes role model
but what is it about systemic racism
that causes black people to idolize
criminal black people
there's no way that's good for them
wouldn't you agree there's no way that's
good for them so there's something about
the systemic racism which has pushed
black people into the worst situation in
the world
because people are imitators right
um I I saw this great quote by
Brett Weinstein talking to Jordan
Peterson I'd never heard it
explain this way
that the job of parents is to model the
outside world
so that the kid grows up with the
software in their head to know how to
deal with the outside world because
their inside experience was similar
enough in other words your parents and
this is what Jordan Peterson says your
parents should not be easier on you than
the outside world
so if you mess up the parents should
give you a penalty yeah with love
but you know then you go to the real
world and you realize oh if I mess up
I'm going to get a penalty maybe with
less love
so
and and the thinking behind this and
they're they're both completely correct
in their characterizations uh the
thinking behind it is that humans are
copiers
we imitate other people we do it
automatically and we can't turn it off
you just can't turn it off
I remember when live streaming was newer
than it is now
and
um I was watching a lot of new new
podcasters and live streamers and they
were they look like just
bad photocopies of Mike cernovich
because Mike cernovich was good at it
so people just saw him he was good at it
and they just copied him and they even
they even would use his phrasings and
his even his
um even his mannerisms and it was it was
completely obvious that they were just
imitating
somebody who had done something well
now in that case they imitated yeah
Erica you know exactly what I'm talking
about in that case they uh
in that case they imitated somebody was
doing a great job and I think it really
helped them now in the end I think they
managed to find their own voices right
by imitating something is a really good
way to start
really good the way I became a
cartoonist is by imitating other
cartoonists and eventually because I
didn't do it well it looked like my own
work
that's a good trick just imitate things
poorly until it looks like your original
so I would if I were
if I were trying to fix the problems in
Black America I would go after
systemic racism that for whatever reason
causes them to imitate the wrong people
and when I say wrong people I mean
imitate people who would lead them to a
sub-optimal life
but also the school system is a mess and
that's the biggest problem of systemic
racism
all right
um
this next story
is related
somewhat to the last one
but I'm going to try to read this story
without laughing
and I want to see if you could do the
same because if you laugh at this story
you're a disgusting racist
but if if like me you're a good person
like me
you will look at this and say my God
my God how could people be so
insensitive
so be like me
be like a person who cares and shows
empathy don't be like you might have
been
before I warned you before I warned you
you might have just laughed at this joke
and then what a piece of garbage you
would be
you would be just a piece of garbage if
you laugh at this
so I'll read CNN's report
and because I'm a good person I'm not
going to laugh
a middle school in New York and it's
food vendor Aramark apologized after
students were served Chicken and Waffles
along with watermelon on the first day
of Black History Month
cold
hold
the lunch menu offered on February 1st
at Nyack Middle School in Rockland
County was quote inexcusably insensitive
and reflected a lack of understanding of
our District's Vision to address racial
bias
said the principle
hold
no laughing
no laughing
okay here's my real opinion
if black Americans want not just full
equality
and not just full equity
but to blast past white Americans and
just dominate the world
laugh at this
just find this funny
just treat it like the it is
now I don't know why this vendor did
this I don't know why
but I know it doesn't matter
I know it's funny
I know it doesn't say anything about any
of us doesn't say anything about black
people doesn't say anything about the
Aramark vendor I mean it could have been
a joke
yeah do you know what was not reported
here here's what was not reported
is it at all possible that the vendor
was black
I don't know but it seems like that
would have been important to the story
to know that right because I can't
imagine a white vendor doing that
but could I imagine a black vendor doing
it because it was funny
yes
I could imagine a black vendor thinking
oh this is just funny
because what the hell is black food
right yeah like what is that
if you can't laugh at that
then I don't think you could be
successful
honestly
if you can't just laugh at this and
treat it as nothing you could never be
successful in this world
if you think this mattered
and you needed to spend some time on it
to be outraged you will never be
successful
it's just a guarantee your software is
broken
so this is sort of the Morgan Freeman
approach I'm taking a version of this
we need to figure out how to laugh at
this stuff right and and just to be
clear
when uh I've told you this before when a
black follower of my live streams I
asked what would be like a white thing I
was asking for examples of stereotypical
white things
and she said well you like cheese like
white people like cheese
I laughed for 20 minutes
because it sort of rings true
I never thought of it before but I
didn't feel insulted
you know I'm not insulted that white
people apparently like cheese
I really like cheese
sorry I really like cheese I like it
so we got to get to a point where black
Americans are not idolizing criminals
and we can laugh at things that are just
just BS
and we can laugh together
right if you can't laugh together
you don't have anything
right yeah I feel like if you were going
to fix one thing
to make everything better if the only
thing you fixed is our senses of humor
you'd be in a really good shape wouldn't
you
imagine if every time something like
this came up we all laughed at it
together
how about we laugh at it together
because it's so stupid at this point I
mean it's just ridiculous and it's not
like anybody doesn't want to help and
you know it's not like we don't know how
to fix things
all right
um
I'm going to teach you on my whiteboard
how to spot cognitive dissonance
would you like that
see which side is on
here it is
this is a very handy thing for social
media and other debating
so what I'm going to try to do
is teach you a superpower
and here are my tells for cognitive
dissonance
number one if somebody changes the topic
their their experiencing cognitive
dissonance now I was asked for a
clarification on this one because lots
of times people will be trying to make a
point and it's not getting through
and then it was pointed out to me
sometimes people will say all right let
me take a different approach
I'm not talking about a different
approach
because that's the same topic
here's what I'm talking about oh yeah
your opinion about whatever uh
I judge that based on your opinion on
this different topic
okay that's cognitive distance
right if you have to change the whole
topic it's because you you have to bow
out you didn't have anything uh ad
hominem this is when you just insult
people
so I get this one a lot
if I've won an argument the next thing I
hear is an insult to me personally
it's pretty consistent so ad hominem
means you want
changing the topic means you want
you could just say okay I'll take
Victory I'm done
mind reading
um I like to think this is one of my
greatest contributions to civilization
now I'm sure I'm not the first person to
make this observation that people
imagine they know what you're thinking
but I'm trying to popularize it and give
it a name so that when we talk about it
you know we're talking about the same
thing so how many times have you seen me
in a debate online and then somebody
will say well obviously you believed
that scientists are reliable
that's mind reading and incorrect mind
reading because I don't believe
scientists are reliable in fact science
is the most unreliable of all things do
you know why
why is science the most unreliable
field
because if everything works correctly
you're wrong most of the time
if everything's working smoothly you're
wrong most of the time and then a few
things will pass you know through the
peer review it'll get published peer
review you'll be able to duplicate it
you know maybe you don't have a
randomized controlled trial yet but you
get one that you get another one right
so you're you're crawling through
uncertainty and largely wrong stuff
until you get something closer to truth
so science is mostly about being wrong
and then every now and then something
awesome happens a great process that you
know but mostly wrong
so mind reading about uh what is true in
the person's mind is always a tell and
when I see this I say thank you and I'm
done word salad is a little harder to
identify
because it really looks like it might
make sense but maybe you're not getting
the point
the word salad is often related to a
change of Topic in other words the word
salad often brings in other topics and
mixes them together and puts them in
sentences where the sentence appears to
make sense from a grammar perspective
but when you look at it as a whole it's
not really saying anything
so you recognize the word solid when you
see it
um
this one will be harder to explain using
an analogy instead of a reason
analogies are fine if the only way
you're using them is to explain A New
Concept
that's a good use of an analogy but if
you use it instead of a reason as in in
this case we did it this way so in this
unrelated case which I'm reminded of we
should do it the same way
that's using it as a reason
that's the wrong way to reuse it that's
usually a tell for cognitive distance
because you don't need an analogy if you
have a reason
here would be here would be an example
of somebody who has a reason hey why
should I not do this thing oh because
it's very risky because this could break
it's unreliable and if that breaks
you'll be injured
that's somebody who understands the
situation
here's somebody who doesn't understand
why you shouldn't do that thing all
right all right suppose you were on a
ship and the ship captain told you not
to lean over the rail okay as soon as
you hear that
you know that they don't have a reason
they're using an analogy to try to try
to make you not notice there's no reason
reasons are easy oh don't do that
because it's dangerous
simple
oh it's very much like a spaceship if
you were designing a spaceship you'd
make sure that the O-rings no no as soon
as you go that direction it means you
don't know your own argument
all right
here's a new one
insisted it's complicated and cannot be
summarized
foreign
so if you've seen this lately it's
complicated it just can't be summarized
do you know what can't be summarized
cognitive dissonance everything else
could be summarized right even if even
if the summary doesn't tell you much
right so there's nothing I can't
summarize
it's easy to summarize
summarizing is the easiest thing in the
world
the only thing you can't summarize is
something you don't understand yourself
or it doesn't doesn't fit your point
Barnes says I don't know about that all
right and then my favorite is the sotel
where somebody starts a sentence with
the word so
what usually follows the word so in a
debate
is them characterizing your your opinion
incorrectly yeah the Kathy Newman thing
so and usually the the characterization
has an absurd absolute
so here's what it would look like in the
wild so you're saying that every person
who got coveted
had no long covet
or so you're saying that everybody who
got the vaccination made the wrong
decision everybody everybody
or so you're saying that everybody who
went to Harvard is a liberal idiot like
everyone every person who ever went to
Harvard is a liberal idiot that's what
you're saying right so whenever you see
the so look for a mischaracterization of
your opinion now why does somebody need
to mischaracterize your opinion
it's because they're in cognitive
dissonance they they've lost they've
lost the argument and they know it on
some level and so they're they're just
creating nonsense in their minds yeah so
this ladies and gentlemen is the
greatest contribution to the world since
E equals m c squared
if you understand this
and you start to put this filter on your
interactions your stress level will
disappear
because once you see somebody exhibit
one of the seven tells
and by the way making it the seven tells
makes it more powerful persuasion did
you catch that well do you give
something a name and you label it
it becomes real in people's minds
because until it has a name they can't
hang it they can't and store it it's
hard to store a concept but we wrap a
name around it the seven tells for
cognitive dissonance imagine if you said
to somebody oh that is a tell for
cognitive dissonance
it means nothing right just compare
these two things oh that thing you did
that's a tell for cognitive dissonance
really is it I don't think so
now that compare that to oh that's one
of the seven
that's number three on the seven tells
for cognitive dissonance now how does
that feel
completely different doesn't it
just because they're seven
makes you think oh my God that's a real
thing there's seven of them it must be
like everybody knows the seven tells for
cognitive distance but I don't oh no I
better figure out what that means
completely different persuasion just by
saying it's one of the seven tells
seven cognitive sins
[Music]
I like tell us better
but I like where you're going with that
right now I'm going to say it again
without any hyperbole whatsoever
this is one of the greatest things that
Humanity has ever experienced
if you understand these seven tells the
whole world looks different and all the
people that you think are just
annoyingly not getting your argument you
can just say oh I won the argument
already
you did this one oh I won the argument
you did that and just walk away
uh
somebody just said someone is brought up
and someone thinks you're bsing they can
find it online Okay that was a good use
of so
yeah
so by the way uh the sotel is not a
hundred percent
but it's probably 95.
probably 95.
um
oh I was going to add projection so
there's some projection happening here
so somebody's saying that Scott is
blissfully unaware that he does all of
these things
this projection
but projection I didn't want to put on
the list
because everybody thinks everybody's
projecting
so you can't use it as a standard
does that make sense you could
definitely use these as standards
because they're very objective it's easy
to see if somebody changed the topic
it's easy to see if they're mind reading
right there's a little but projection is
what everybody blames everybody of on
both sides
so if you use that as your indicator
the other person just says no that's
what you're doing I I indicated on you
but but it doesn't work this way if
somebody insults you and you have an
insult to them
you can't really say well you insulted
me when it didn't happen
but everybody says everybody's
projecting
now let me ask you
could you identify that that user was
projecting
because if you watched me
get into public arguments which I do
every day in public have you seen me do
um mind reading
or word sound
or change to a new topic sometimes I do
that but it's for not because I lost the
argument
yeah if you do see these things
if you if you see me exhibit any of
these things call it out
call it out now here's the next most
important thing you need to know
did I just say that I'm immune to
cognitive dissonance because I accuse
the other person of projecting nope nope
no I am completely susceptible to
cognitive dissonance
I have some technique
that I think is helpful but you know
it's not a perfect protection
more like a shot than a vaccination if
you know what I mean you know what I
mean
so that was a that was a good use of an
analogy
because the because I didn't require it
to make my argument in other words I
could have made it without the analogy
I could have just said it's risky
um
yeah we all have our blind spots so if
you're looking for my blind spots look
in the same place
right use this standard to evaluate me
and you will absolutely
sooner or later you'll find me
experiencing cognitive distance
all right
that's the most helpful thing I've done
I tried to introduce a concept
today that I found had already been
introduced but I'll promote it then I
was watching uh CNN and Jim Acosta
sent a correspondent for his show to a
trump event recently
and the correspondent
um let me ask you if you can guess what
happened
did the correspondent uh show us some
video of him interviewing perfectly
reasonable people who attended the Trump
result or event or did he talk to the
most outrageously interesting people
of course it was the most outrageously
interesting people so one of the
interviews was two women who believed
that Trump still controls part of the
military
and that there are two militaries a
Biden military and a trump military
right now at the moment there are two
militaries now
you might say well that's a little out
there that's a little out there but the
only point I want to make is
you know that's not representative of
the group
and of course the right does the same
thing to the left right same thing they
they pick the worst members of that
group and try to act like the whole
group is you know Communists and
socialists and stuff and
I thought it needs a it needs a name
so I suggested the name not picking
so so instead of cherry picking you know
where you cherry pick data
if you're talking about humans you're
picking knots basically so it's not
picking
it turns out that that has been a phrase
that has been a phrase since at least
2018.
um
so you know I saw a tweet on it earlier
so so nut picking is already existing
now I think nut picking was more about
the topic than the person but it works
both ways
so let's use that
so the the Jim Acosta interview was a
was a a not picking thing now the thing
I like about it
is it sounds like you're playing with
your balls
doesn't it like like indirectly if you
accuse somebody of nut picking it sounds
like they're just playing with their own
balls
which is just as useful as nut picking
oh here's an analogy
uh talking to the weirdest person in the
group and presenting it to the group is
as useful to the rest of the society as
you staying home and playing with your
balls
very similar benefit to society so
there's a good analogy for you yeah not
picking
so be careful we're all nut Pickers
that this would be another thing that I
would uh I would assume I've done some
nut picking have I
I'll ask you you're a better judge of
this than I am you you watch me a lot
have I not picked have I ever tried to
paint a group by its nuttiest people
I assume I have because it's just so
easy to fall into that I assume I have
right but yeah do you do you remember
any ex every day do you know any
examples
because sometimes you just talk about
the bad people
uh because they're more interesting
but I don't ever try to paint the entire
group by any individuals but if I did
oh Russians
I don't know maybe
all right but I let me let me accept in
advance I probably do that all right now
I told you we're in act three of my
personal movie
and in act three this is where the hero
escapes from an impossible trap
now the impossible trap is the beginning
of act three now my impossible trap was
I managed to piss off everybody on the
vaccination slash shot topic and I
finally figured out what was the entire
source of difference between me and the
people who were sure I got everything
wrong it turns out the only difference
was one word
do you believe that
that we Define one word differently and
that's the entire difference
and if we defined it the same or just
didn't use that word
we would actually be in complete
agreement
do you believe that
watch me prove it
that will require a whiteboard
all right
this might look like a rational process
to you it should because it is a
rational process
so a rational process is if no matter
what the topic is so it could be any
topic you would do your research and try
to figure out what the facts are what
things do you know for sure but because
it's the real world you have to add some
assumptions
for example if you're looking at
um should you get vaccinated or or get
the shots or whatever you might make the
following assumptions
I assumed that most of the injury from
the shot would show up in the first six
months
but I don't know that
I don't know that I assumed it and I
assumed it because that's how other
shots have worked most of most of the
problems showed up in the first six
months that's why I waited six months
before I got mine now other people made
a different assumption
other people said well I assume
that there could be lots of bad things
that happen later now that's true
I would share that assumption
but I assume that most of the risk was
in the first six months I think most
people would agree uh other people
assumed
that uh the long coveted thing was
artificial
and that there wasn't really much of a
long covered risk so they assumed that
wasn't much to talk about I assumed that
since I didn't know if it was a big risk
or not and there were lots of anecdotal
suggestions that it was a risk that it
should be considered as one of the big
risks
but other people assumed differently now
those are just some of the assumptions
there were a whole bunch of assumptions
about for example some people assumed
that the the medical communities in all
places were making decisions based on
fear of being fired or going along with
the crowd or a bunch of other things so
a whole bunch of assumptions about how
people act I'm not saying they were
wrong
I'm just saying they were assumptions
now I made different assumptions
my assumption was that even if you had
lots of people who were afraid there'd
always be a few people who weren't
and there would be enough people to you
know make it more of a more of a fight
but there were in fact a number of
Rogues you know people who were uh
bucking the Main Street and some of them
ended up being right in the end
so what would you call this whole
process where you research facts of
course you have assumptions you can't
escape this
you cannot Escape assumptions
then you analyze it all you use your
best judgment and your reason and you
come to a correct answer what would you
call this process
go how would you label that
somebody say risk management deductive
reasoning
right now I did this stuff for a living
so it used to be my job to make
Financial predictions for the companies
I work for so I would say oh here's our
budget here's what we plan to do this is
what it will look like three years from
now and I always made a bunch of
assumptions
to back the things I did know so
assumptions plus things I knew
so do you know what I call this
I call it guessing
when I presented it
to people did I tell you it was a guess
when I presented it to like managers no
no it was a forecast
that was the forecast so when I talked
to the people who are the audience for
it I said it was a prediction and it was
a forecast
if you talk to me in my cubicle and you
were my co-worker and you said you know
how did you come up to this I go well
the assumptions were so important to the
outcome
that it's basically a guess
it's a guess
now you could say it's an educated guess
you could say it's an educated guess but
that's still a guess
that's just a form of guess it's a guess
it's an informed guess but the educated
part and the informed part don't have
any predictive value
they don't if you believe in educated
guess is going to be to guess guess
well I would argue that almost all
guesses are educated guesses like in the
real world
it's just that we're educated
differently
so that the education part doesn't help
because we're educated differently
so I guess guess lighting oh that's
pretty clever guest lighting instead of
gas lighting I like that
all right so
if you made this one change
where people who do this kind of work
know it's guessing
we know it's guessing when we do it we
know it's guessing
you don't know it's guessing because I
don't present it to you that way I
present it to you as a well-reasoned
forecast
and then you think oh well he says it's
a well-reasoned forecast showed all of
his work I saw the spreadsheets I saw
the columns they seemed to add up yeah
that looks like a pretty solid reasoning
you got there no it is absolutely just a
guess
and the all the rest of it is to launder
your gas
so that people like you
will believe it was something other than
a guess
but it wasn't it was always a guess
always guess and since I can guess
either way
sometimes it's worse than a guess
sometimes you're just forcing the data
to be what your boss wanted it to be so
that's even worse than a guess it's
purely fraudulent
now let's look at climate change
I saw a great
um podcast interview with Jordan
Peterson and
um
Curry what's her first name
Professor Curry
who talks about climate change what's
her first name not Adam no the woman
Judith Curry yeah Judith Curry Professor
not Professor doctor doctorate so Dr
Curry who is famous for questioning some
of the climate change uh you know
predictions and I heard her story and I
understood her for the first time
meaning I I got where she was coming
from I I've understood her I just got
where she's coming from
I didn't know this about her background
so she has the right educational
credentials for what she's dealing with
but earlier in her career I think in the
80s
she first came to notice within the
climate change conversation because she
did a study that showed that hurricanes
were increasing recently
and it was
um potential suggestion that climate
change was causing an increase in
hurricanes
did you know that
so at the moment she's considered one of
the you know leading
um critics of the prediction models just
the prediction models not necessarily
the concept of climate change but the
prediction part
and that she started out as one of those
people
somebody who is producing alarmist data
subsequent to her producing this
alarmist data her critics looked at her
data and said wait a minute the data for
50 the first 15 years of this period
you're looking at we know the data is
wrong and we know why
like we know for sure that data is wrong
then Judith Curry did
one of the most heroic things you will
ever see in the world of science
she changed her mind
because the data led her to change her
mind and when she started becoming more
of a data expert
as opposed to a science expert
because she was sort of a science expert
already
but she had made a mistake with Dana
and then she was brought into the world
of you could do all the science you want
but if the data is wrong it's not going
to help you a bit and by the way most of
our data is sketchy
so she's she sort of got there the
honest way you know she's more like a
somebody who quit smoking it was more
anti-smoking than people who never quit
that sort of thing so she really got
there the honest Way by being on one
side if if you could call it that I mean
that's a mischaracterization but on
being sort of uh on the alarmist team
somewhat accidentally and finding out
that the data was wrong and then I think
that I think that changed her filter
again this would be this would be a case
of mind reading but I'm telling you I'm
doing it so that's not a cognitive
dissonance tell if I tell you I'm doing
it uh so I'm speculating
that when something like that happens to
you you realize how wrong you were
because you trusted data
that it makes you more distrustful of
data that the most obvious thing you
would predict from that situation so I
think that's what made her so effective
I I think having that
um negative experience made her a little
more distrustful of data maybe look into
it a little deeper than other people and
find more problems
so that was really interesting to see
that little
little element there now
um
she also makes a great case oh here's
here's something I wanted to clarify
you heard me maybe on a prior podcast
say that
the scientists have considered the sun
because people say hey the scientists
don't know that the sun is the main
driver of the models
and I pooh-poohed that and I said the
scientists obviously have considered the
Sun
yeah if you're imagining that they
forgot to look at the sun you know and
the the cycles of the sun then you're
crazy of course they did but then I
listened to the Judith Curry interview
and here's what I learned
well yes it's true that the scientists
definitely have looked into the Sun so I
was right about that
but they didn't include it in their
predictions
what
in other words we know there's a natural
sun cycle as there are other there are
other natural cycles so I was correct
that of course the scientists looked
into the sun of course they did
and then they didn't put it in their
models
so so at the very least it now by the
way that doesn't prove that you know
climate change isn't real it doesn't
prove that it's not a problem I don't
know about that but
uh it certainly proves that the models
are ridiculous
right would you agree if if the known if
the known uh let's say cycles of the sun
are not included
it's probably an important omission and
there I'm sure there were other things
like that right
now what was it
that made that not included
was it
knowledge certain
knowledge certain that it didn't matter
or was it an assumption
huh
I've Got a Feeling if you dig into these
climate models you're going to find some
things that look like to your mind
assumptions don't you think
yes of course every model has lots of
assumptions
some of the assumptions are so basic you
don't need to mention them
like I assume the world will still have
oxygen I assume we will not be attacked
by aliens between now and 50 years from
now I assume we will not invent any
magic pills to solve climate change
right so it's filled with assumptions
filled with assumptions
which I call
guesses
so
this is my third act ladies and
gentlemen
where where I've LED you to at Great
personal risk
reputational risk
everybody involved
was guessing
based on my definition of that word
if they would like to use other words
and say no no no Scott that's not
guessing we call this common sense
I'd say okay we're not disagreeing
you're just using different words
right
if somebody says that this is a
reasonable scientific process
I wouldn't debate that because that's
just words
I would say oh okay you want to call it
a reasonable scientific process I would
call it guessing but we're talking about
the same stuff there's no difference in
what it is
we both know there are assumptions we
both know there's reasons and data
I call that guessing because it can't
tell you the answer
if it could tell you the answer with
certainty then I'd call it a science or
I call it engineering or something like
that
all right here's another
here's another mind Bender for you
do scientists ever prove that they're
right
do scientists ever prove that they're
right
well it's a trick question
Engineers prove that scientists are
right
only
the only thing that you know is true
is something you can build from it
and it works
that's it everything else is tentative
I'm watching the disagreement
I bet you there's not a single engineer
who disagrees with me if he can't build
to it
you can't be sure
sorry
yeah now uh of course there of course
there are situations where you can
repeat the experiment
right
but if you could repeat the experiment
all day and then you couldn't engineer
something with it
the repeated experiments were flawed
because repeated experiments could be
flawed
if you can't build something with it
it's not real
now
I'm being provocative by making it an
absolute there's probably no absolutes
but
nothing's real until you engineer it
so I would say that Engineers decide
what's real
and scientists take their their best
their best reasoned opinion of it
yeah it takes a while for this one this
one takes a while to sink in doesn't it
your your first reaction is that can't
be right
but once you live with it a little bit
you just see think about some more
examples there are plenty of examples
where people engineered things the
scientists said couldn't work you know
that right
there are plenty of examples where
people have engineered things the
science said was impossible
that's true
the only thing that's true is what you
can engineer everything else is a guess
airplanes good example the airplane wing
yeah good example
yeah the scientists find supporting
evidence and they can find supporting
evidence
all day long and it's still not real
until somebody builds something with it
and it works
explain cognitive dissonance in one
sentence okay
so this was a challenge to see if I can
summarize a complicated thing because I
made the claim anything complicated can
be summarized
cognitive dissonance is a spontaneous
illusion
that people are triggered into
whenever their self-image
is in conflict with the observable facts
one sentence
that's my point
if you understand your topic you can
summarize it very easily it's not even a
challenge
easy
right
I would say it's a hallucination
yeah I wouldn't call it confusion
is it an ego protection mechanism
essentially
essentially yeah yeah we we have an
um a natural desire to be consistent
so what
um are you on blood pressure meds no not
at the moment
summarize what a woman is
well of course that's a social construct
[Laughter]
all right
all right uh YouTube that's all I've got
for you today I think you'll agree this
is the most informative and useful live
stream you've ever seen in your entire
life and on that note I'm gonna spend
some time with the locals people who are
special
and I'll see you tomorrow
bye for
