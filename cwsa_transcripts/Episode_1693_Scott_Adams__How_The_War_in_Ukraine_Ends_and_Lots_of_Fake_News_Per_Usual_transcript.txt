good morning everybody
and welcome
to the high energy
excitement that is coffee with scott
adams some of you you might want to
check your blood pressure because the
excitement
is just beginning and if you'd like to
take it up a notch if your heart can
handle it talk to your doctor first all
you need is
i almost read this upside down
that would have been weird it would have
gone like this kind of a vessel flask or
jug canteen
stein or chalice tanker
glass or mug or cup
now if i did that you would try to sip
but your coffee mug would be upside down
the coffee would end up under your lap
no good let's do it the right way shall
we
um
you do not have a sound problem shot
all right all you need to do is i cover
among your glasses up tiger jealous it's
time to came to your last vessel in the
car it's all your favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day i think it makes
everything better it's cold
oh youtube audio
how can you
am i really gonna have to to check
this again
all right hold on hold on youtube it's
not on my end
is it
no it's not in my hand
so uh
you're out of luck
uh another mic is stolen
it's all good it's all plugged in
let us continue and i'll turn off
youtube in a moment uh if you can
complain
wait did we do the simultaneous zip
we didn't even do the second of the zip
hold on get ready
get ready
go
ah yeah youtube's working fine
are there you trolls go away trolls so
elon musk had a cryptic tweet today or
yesterday he asked this question with a
little twitter poll he said free speech
is essential to functioning democracy
he said do you believe twitter
rigorously adheres to this principle
meaning free speech
but here's the cryptic part are you
ready
remember it's elon musk asking the
question
if it were not elon musk
this would not be interesting
and he says the consequences of this
poll will be important please vote
carefully
now when elon musk says the consequences
of your twitter poll will
be important
what is he talking about
is he going to buy twitter
because
maybe
maybe
does anybody know how much twitter would
sell for
can somebody i'll bet there's somebody
here as an estimate give me an estimate
of the value of twitter
if you were going to buy it you know i
don't know if it's for sale but if you
were going to buy it
well it's more than a billion and
there's way more than a billion
no it's way more than 5 billion isn't it
market cap is 30 billion thank you
whoever uses the phrase market cap
i'm gonna i'm going to assume that you
know what you're talking about because
regular people don't say market cap
so let's say it's 30 billion
could elon musk buy a 30 billion dollar
company
pretty sure he could
pretty sure
he wouldn't have to buy the whole thing
he could go in with other investors and
just have a controlling chair or
something
but uh yeah he could do it now i think
the bad play
is creating your own twitter
but is there anybody who could create
their own twitter better than elon musk
because he's weirdly neither right nor
left is he
i mean he seems to take positions that
just sort of make sense he's not right
or left
so if he made a twitter
knockoff
oh oh somebody's saying maybe he would
buy one of the competing
like getter or something oh there you go
yeah interesting
let's keep an eye on that it does look
like a uh
shot across the bow of twitter maybe
he's just trying to scare them into free
speech
speaking of social media platforms uh
facebook now called meta
is taking remote work to the extreme
extreme
remote work
well i don't know how extreme it is that
you're just working at home but
apparently the extreme part is that
people are not just working from home
but they're moving to other states
and that's their new home sometimes and
then they work from there
i don't know how extreme that is
but
um i think i'm going to put tape over
the comments
it's audio i just put a little yellow
sticky over the comments on youtube for
a minute because i keep hearing all the
the trolls
so they'll go away and they'll take that
off
um
so facebook is doing this
remote work thing and it's kind of
genius that they're priming the pump
this way
i guess i can't put the sticky note
there that's where the camera is
um
they're priming the pump
because when everything is uh
in the virtual world
when it seems to me that it's inevitable
that you're going to go to work
in a virtual world
does anybody disagree
that it's inevitable that you will
someday go to work without leaving your
chair
right
now you might say to me well that's not
gonna work if you have a physical job
if you're physically moving things
you're gonna have to go to work
i'm not so sure
because if you have a robot
that you can control by you know
inhabiting it so that the robot moves
the way you want it to move and maybe
even the robot moves with your body
you know its arms might move like your
arms you actually
were very close
to being able to go to work and have
arms and legs at work
and even a body that can you know move
around that already exists they already
have telepresence robots they can go to
work for you and move from room to room
and talk to people
so
doesn't it make sense
that everything is going to be in the
metaverse eventually
this play by facebook is really
interesting in part because well maybe
largely because it's uh zuckerberg's
play
when was the last time zuckerberg was
wrong
on a big move now you don't like some of
the things he's done
privacy wise etc but in terms of
business moves like big business moves
such as
buying whatsapp or buying instagram or
zuckerberg has
done quite a good job hasn't he of
predicting the future and adapting to it
so i would say that when zuckerberg says
the future is
this virtual world
i really believe it
partly because i believed it anyway so
anybody who agrees with me sounds extra
smart
but yeah i think uh but but it is
possible that facebook is going to go
through some really tough times
because i think their legacy model is
sort of a dead man walking
i can't believe that facebook
the old facebook
it doesn't seem survivable to me
because kids don't use it
isn't that the end of the story
or do kids grow up and start using it
because i i'm an adult i gotta use
facebook
facebook has like no impact on my
personal life
uh at all
it's just irrelevant
so they do need a different business
model i think their meta play
could be
maybe one of the greatest
it could end up being one of the
greatest business moves of all time
um
anyway
so what else we got uh trump is suing
hillary clinton and others
uh because of their claims in 2016 about
russia collusion
now
what do you think about that number one
is this case likely to get to trial what
do you think
is it going to make it to trial or we'll
get it thrown out long before that
it's very difficult to prove that
somebody knew something right
but what's weird about this case
is that there's so much actual uh
discovery already
because the special prosecutor etc has
produced lots of reliable information or
it would look reliable in some other
court case
so
i feel like
without knowing anything about the law
of course
i feel like you might have a chance
my instinct is that these things always
get thrown out especially if it's in a
political realm
because it's really hard to say that a
politician lied about you in a way that
hurts you
since that's all they do basically is
lie about each other so it seems like a
very hard
uh case
uh
i'm watching there's a whole fight going
on in youtube so some people are having
complaining about the sound and other
people are saying it's fine
let me just take a second all right
youtubers
is there anybody who has good sound
anybody at all has good sound just even
one person
is there anybody who has good sound in
there
it looks like no
um
nobody there's not one person who has
adequate assault on youtube
sound is bad okay well there's nothing i
can do about it there must be a youtube
problem
everything's good in mind
all right
here's what i think is interesting it
could be
and maybe i need a lawyer to help me
sort this out there are lots of lawyers
watching this always so
do you think that trump's real play is
discovery
do you think that the real thing is
either political to put something in the
news that people have to talk about that
makes it makes it sound like uh he was
right or is it because the process will
allow more discovery
and that process will just be infinitely
good for trump if he's running for a
re-election because the process would
take a long time
wouldn't be completed probably before
the election in 2024
so the optics are good aren't they
that this looks like a great persuasion
play
but legally
it doesn't seem like he could win it
and it's not because he's not right by
the way
i think you could say with certainty
that he can
that he could make a case that he was
damaged he could make a case that was
intentional and he could probably
connect the dots to hillary clinton
it's not enough
i don't know what it would take to
convict hillary clinton in a world where
there are so many democrats who don't
want that to happen
but
all right
let us
do this
there must be a way for me to mute
uh hide all chat messages there we go
so i can't i can't see your messages on
youtube because all you want to talk
about is the sound if it doesn't work
for you uh you could try going to locals
um
just search for coffee wisconsin locals
locals.com
and i believe i
kept that unprotected this morning
all right so i'll be watching that
that'll be fun
um here's what reuters said in this
story about trump suing clinton
and i want to see if you've noticed this
little
subtle but not subtle shift
and it goes like this
there reuters actually writes
matter-of-factly
that trump's claims about the 2020
election are quote false claims where
they say he falsely claims
now
um
are there sounds good on youtube all
right
i'll
turn their chat back
um
and
does it make sense to you
that a news organization
can call trump's claims or his
allegations
false
how do you know there's
false did somebody audit the election
that i don't know about
the the election wasn't audited
how would you possibly know if it were
false just you know very minor parts
were monitored you don't know about the
99 of it do you
um
so somehow the fake news
has allowed you to accept uncritically
that trump's allegations about the
election went from unproven
to proven false
when did that happen
that never happened
but it's reported as a fact
bill maher says they are false yeah
everybody says they're false
but i'm not sure if they're playing sort
of a trick here
because
i also agree that the election happened
and that biden was elected
do you know why do you know i allow that
the i don't think i've ever said this
before the reason that i'm perfectly
comfortable with the election outcome
even though i accept that uh trump's
allegations could be true
there's no way to prove him false
at the moment and there's no way to
prove them true
but
no matter whether the the election was
um
completely fair or not
i accept the outcome
why
why do i accept the outcome of this of
the election completely
completely without reservation
so he says the reason is i'm a coward
well good gas
good gas it wasn't that
here's why
do you think the other elections
weren't rigged
come on
well why would you pick one election now
and say oh this is the one where there
was some irregularity
they're either they were either always
rigged or they probably haven't been
recently
right
if you don't ins if you don't accept an
election in the united states because
you think they were irregularities you
would never accept any election
we wouldn't be able to run the system
the system requires you to accept a
regular rigged election
in order for the system to work
you know the best it can i mean it's a
bumpy system we don't have a perfect
system nobody says it
the only way we work
is by accepting
sketchy results
it's the only thing that keeps the
system working
yeah the moment i said i don't believe
the result therefore i won't act like a
citizen
the whole thing falls apart
so i think you could completely separate
was it a fair election from the question
of whether as a citizen you should treat
it as
fair for all practical purposes
right so i can't quite get with you in
the overthrow the past election
stuff i don't think i'll ever be on that
train
i think you just need to fix it in the
next election if you can
or maybe you cheat better than the other
side next time it's part of the process
in a way
yeah who cheats better
is not irrelevant
am i right
there's there's some part of this that
says well if everybody's cheating and
everybody's lying
don't you want the one who does it
better
i mean it's not crazy
it's not crazy to want the one who does
it better
right as long as there's some
transparency so they don't do it to you
all right
um there's some reporting now and
there's an opinion by a
gentleman by the name of carafano he's a
vp of the catherine and shelby colin
davis institute for national security
and foreign policy at the heritage
foundation
now let me give you a little advice
should you ever be offered a job
and they say the position is you can be
the vice president of the catherine and
shelby column davis institute for
national security and foreign policy at
the heritage foundation
you should say
can you change the name of my job
because i don't think i can have that
job name
every time somebody asked me where do
you work i said
i'm unemployed
i think i would just lie and say
i'm retired i'm unemployed
yeah what is the acronym
that would be uh
vpksc
no there's nothing there i'm sorry
anyway this gentleman who has some i
guess some background to say stuff like
this he argues that putin's decision to
invade ukraine
uh was actually made in 2014
so when i guess crimea crimea wasn't
invaded
and that he was going to do the rest of
ukraine but the reason he paused
according to kierofano's opinion
is that
putin didn't know how the trump
administration would react
so apparently putin had decided that
obama was going to be hands off and that
putin could get away with whatever he
could get away with and there were there
were enough anecdotal
uh evidences of that
that putin probably felt emboldened
and that his emboldened feeling ended
abruptly when trump came into office
because putin couldn't tell what trump
would do
exactly what trump promised he would
bring to the office
one of his greatest benefits he said he
would bring it
he brought it
and then there's at least this you know
a well-founded opinion we don't know if
it's true but a good opinion that says
it might have made the difference for at
least four years
so
uh and it's pointed out that trump was
nicer publicly to putin but tougher
in terms of policy and stuff
um and part of kara fondo's argument
is that the obama
foreign you know foreign relations
people
and advisors were the same ones
from obama
so putin's
from putin's perspective it looks like
just obama too
because it's the same staff
and biden is basically obama too
so from putin's perspective
the election of biden was a green light
and then biden goes ahead and says you
know we're never going to commit ground
troops which of course is a smart idea
but then putin says well okay if you're
obama-like and you always you always
cave
and you're not too concerned about us
and if you said you're not going to send
in ground troops
i feel like you just said go ahead
so
there's one argument that biden himself
caused the war
you know just by the
uh the
the low quality of his leadership i
guess
now
here's what i would uh
caution you
you have to be careful when one
political side says the other is
incompetent
because they all do
all the time there's no exception
there's no time that the democrats said
you know we don't like those republicans
but you know when it comes to the
economy they're killing it you know they
do good job there
that never happens
you know both sides criticize everything
from the other side so if you see any
argument that even looks solid this does
look like a solid a fairly solid
hypothesis anyway uh just remember it
comes from
somebody you don't know
so don't put too much
uh don't put too much trust in any
opinion like that one
well there's a report uh i guess
erdogan of turkey
uh i want to pronounce his name erdogan
or dogen
but i believe it's erdogan
is that correct and i
strongly oppose people who spell things
with letters that don't belong
uh if
if you spell your name e-r-d-o-g-a-n
you should be called erdogan
and if you say people know the
pronunciation is erdogan
i would i've been thinking about doing
the same thing
to spell my name a-d-a-m-s just the way
it is
but to pronounce it
then when people say um what's your name
i'll say it's a scot
and they'll say how do you spell that
i'll say a d
a
m s
and they'll say wait how did you
pronounce that they'll say
and they'll say that sounded a little
different than the first time you said
it i said yes
it is one of those names that can be
pronounced variably
based on how i feel at any moment and i
would ask you to use the same name that
i'm using
and you'll have to get an update every
few hours because i don't say it the
same
and if you believe that i cannot tell
you how to pronounce my name
well then
i would like you to talk to my friend
erdogan
as you would call him or as we call him
erdogan
have i made my point i think i have
kazoo exactly
um my bagels are coming
anyway uh erdog erdogan says that
ukraine and russia have reached an
understanding
on four of the six topics of agreement
or disagreement
so according to
erdogan
who you call erdogan because you fall
for his
his technique
um here are some of the things that
they'll probably agree on or they're
close
that ukraine would not be part of nato
there would be partial disarmament there
would be a collective security agreement
and that the russian language would
become an official language
where there's lots of russian anyway
apparently those are no big deal
that uh even uh
zelensky would say okay i mean i could
live with that
then there are two things that are more
consequential remaining topics are
crimea and don pass
to which i say
is there any question about how that's
going to go
are we down to we're down to two points
of disagreement but we all know which
way those go
what it was
is russia going to say you know
i've had second thoughts about this
primary crimea situation
i think i should just give it back
i'll just give it back
that's not gonna happen
so
am i wrong that there's no reason to
fight anymore and they're just fighting
for no reason at all
i think russia is fighting because
they need to show they're not losing
and zelensky is fighting probably
because the united states wants him
in other words does the united states
want zielinski to make a deal what do
you think
are you seeing the president of the
united states like really pushing
zielinski to make some compromises
there are people who speculate the bible
wants the war more than he wants the
peace
it looks like it i mean we can't read
his mind
so you can only you know judge from the
actions but if you judge from the
actions
it doesn't look exactly like biden wants
the war to stop
it looks like what he wants is to
degrade russia
because he's full of anti-russia people
and permanently degrade them and then
take their business
and so biden is putting together this
alternate energy
channel i guess
with uh western interests that will
provide you know more energy to germany
and europe
and
here's what's missing from the story
how many of you seen the story that says
uh biden is putting together some kind
of a
um a workaround so that the united
states and other producers can produce
gas for uh and deliver it to europe
and that russia will be cut out of that
you know gas deal do you know what's
missing in the story
so far maybe maybe you've seen it but i
haven't seen it yet
numbers
this is a story that depends entirely on
numbers
as in
what percentage of the oil is coming
from russia
and what percentage of that percentage
can be
backfilled by other sources
because i have a bad feeling
that for every 100
cubic whatever of gases coming out of
russia
then maybe the total availability of
alternate sources might be
10 to 20 percent of that
don't we need to know that
you know your your opinion of whether we
should push zelinski to work out a deal
and stop the war
and russia too
would depend a lot on whether you think
you can get alternate sources of energy
to europe in short order
i don't think
that the biden administration and maybe
the news
won't tell us
if we're even close to being able to do
that
isn't that a gigantic question
and isn't it fairly easy to figure it
out if you were a journalist trying to
figure it out
could you not produce numbers of how
much russia is producing
and then ask the americans who are
working on this process how much of that
do you think you could replace
what are they going to say 10
or 90
or 50
the story the the entire story of the
war
hinges on those numbers that are not in
the news
and they could be they could be
right
it doesn't seem hard to produce at least
estimates even if even if the estimates
are wrong
so when you see something like this
that's not in the news
and nobody except me apparently has
noticed it's missing
[Music]
that tells you something i mean that
tells you that the propaganda doesn't
want you to know that
and it probably means that we can't
produce it
am i right if we could if we could find
a way even if it were hard if we could
find a short-term-ish
way to replace all that uh russian
energy you don't think that number would
be in the press
oh it would
it would
and the story would look like this
russia produces x amount of energy
but if you add up these five sources
they come almost the same amount
you tell me you wouldn't see that story
if we could do it
you know i'm right
if we could do it
you'd see the story because it's easy
it's an easy story
the fact that it's not there says this
is propaganda and we can't help europe
i believe that this has nothing to do
with producing energy
and everything to do with keeping europe
in the war
right
because biden
if you if you take the hypothesis that
biden likes the war more than the peace
at least in the short run
he wants to degrade russia and really
ostracize them and you know make them
basically permanently unable to
build a powerful military
it looks like all he's doing is making
europe happy that they won't starve to
death and run out of energy
but they might
so somebody asked on twitter describing
and you know how could this happen
here's how i see it ending
you see there'll be a negotiated
settlement
much along the lines of what uh er
erdogan or as you call them erdogan said
that seems like roughly what it's got to
look like i mean somewhere in that range
and
i think that means that russia will
continue to be the at least in the short
term the supplier of energy to europe
so i think energy
won't run out in europe because russia
will sell it
we will let them
because it will come after a negotiated
deal
um
shipping fentanyl all right
all right um
let's see
justice clarence thomas's wife jeannie
thomas
apparently a conservative activist
we know now that she was emailing a
number of times
white house chief of staff mark meadows
during the trump the last days of the
trump administration and um
with her quote unrelenting efforts
to try to overturn the 2020 election
result
now
the scandal here
is that while she was an activist
working to
have the result overturned there was
talk about the supreme court having to
make decisions related to this same
topic
so how awful would it be
to have the supreme court one of the
supreme court justices
uh wife active
in a thing that he might have to rule on
there's nothing here
there's nothing in this story
but let me let me just propose a
question to the supreme court
dear supreme court i like your ruling on
this
can the spouse of a supreme court
justice
have free speech
yes or no
 yes
yes
i'm pretty sure i would say this if this
had been a democrat leading judge and a
you know democrat activist
i don't think you can make an exception
for free speech
does anybody disagree with that why is
this even the story
we already knew she was a conservative
activist
we already knew that basically everybody
who was pro-trump was questioning the
election result
she was just one of the people who was
talking about it and doing something she
made some phone calls
that's it
she had an opinion she had access she
made some phone calls
or since she sent some emails i guess
so there's nothing for this story
unless you're actually going to actively
entertain
the idea that the wife or the spouse of
a justice doesn't have free speech
and we're not we're not going to
entertain that ever
that will never be
something we entertain as a possibility
so why are we even talking about it
she had an opinion she did something
about it like a free citizen somebody
saw it
let's move on about nothing now did it
have an impact
i doubt it do you think justice thomas
was uh almost going to vote for the
whatever the democrat view on something
was going to be
i doubt it is
i don't think see the problem with the
supreme court
is that you already know how they're
going to vote almost all the time
if you didn't know how they were going
to vote then you might worry about them
being influenced but if you already know
how they're going to vote on all the big
stuff
here's a uh
horrible thing that happened biden
talking not even in the in the united
states on a foreign trip
mentioned again the fine people hoax as
if it were real you know the charlotte's
the idea that trump actually praised
neo-nazis in charlottesville
by the way if there's anybody who's
watching this live stream
and still believes that trump literally
praised neo-nazis and charlottesville
do a little homework
because i think by now you should know
that edited videos can reverse their
meaning
that's all that was so if you're new if
you're new to this
that's the most debunked story that the
mainstream
press has said has been true for years
but biden again you know uh uses this
uh hoax like israel it's way worse when
you do it overseas everybody agree
that the way a president acts
domestically
is different or should be than the way
they act when they're on foreign soil no
they don't have to i mean it's not the
law
but it's sort of a tradition and it's a
reasonable tradition
but i think he threw the united states
under the bus on foreign soil
that's what i saw
is that interpretation
no good
because if he's throwing half of the
country under the bus
overseas
that's a no bueno no there's no good
you should be fired for that
that's that's pretty bad
i'm looking at my mixer and my my sound
volume when my end is perfect
all right um
here's a question that i saw on a tweet
from machiavelli's underbelly
uh keeping in mind that the
ukraine forces have verified actual
nazis
small number i think but there are
actual nazis fighting on the side of the
ukrainians
and machiavelli's underbelly said
someone should ask biden
if there are fine people on both sides
of the ukraine russia conflict
please
please
could somebody ask that
because
what's he going to say
is he going to say
that
everybody in the ukrainian military is a
fine person
i mean it's gonna kind of put him in a
little trap isn't it
now let me ask you this
what are the odds
that biden would make his signature move
to become president
um making fun of trump for allegedly
saying
that neo-nazis were fine people and that
biden would
find himself
in the exact situation
as president
of having to explain why these has any
support for a group that has nazis
verified
nazis within them
what are the odds that the simulation
served that enough up to us just by
coincidence
let me ask you
have you ever in your life been in this
situation where somebody accused you
of backing nazis because there were some
in some group that you liked
it's a weird weird situation
and it looks like code reuse
now one of the weirdest uh prediction
methods that i use
and it's it's maddening when it works
because it shouldn't there's no reason
that any logic would connect this
but when you predict that the reality
will will take the same path that a
well-written movie would take or even a
poorly written movie
when you predict that reality will
follow
the the format of a movie and then it
does
is that a coincidence might be
confirmation bias most likely but it's a
weird little technique and uh
i want to show you how well it worked
recently
do you remember that i somewhat
whimsically and jokingly
tweeted
that wouldn't it be sort of perfect if
the simulation gave us the following
finding out that hunter biden funded the
bio lab
the bio labs in ukraine
now
i'm not saying that that happened
i'm just saying wouldn't that be like
the perfect movie
script
right
because you um by the way this is a
seinfeld writing technique
um i once uh
worked with one of the original writers
for scifil
so uh larry charles
not to be confused with larry david
larry david was one of the co-creators
larry charles
was one of the first writers when they
began the show and i worked with larry
on the dilbert tv show so i got to know
him pretty well and he he told me the
story
about um and i probably have all the
details wrong but i think he was taking
a walk with larry david
and they were talking about plots
and writing and they kind of came up
with the idea of having separate plots
that apparently had nothing to do with
each other and then very cleverly tying
them together at the end which became
sort of a staple of seinfeld tv
now
that's not that innovative
because movies always have an a a story
and a b story
and then uh in writing terms the b story
will interfere with the a story
toward the end of the movie that that's
the standard but seinfeld took it to
more of a absurd level
when you're watching a regular movie you
can almost always tell how that b story
is going to interfere with the a story
you know
you can see it coming but in seinfeld
they make the weirdest connections
between the two completely different
stories and that's what's funny what's
funny is that the connection they make
is just so ridiculous but yet in comic
terms it works
so
here we have this situation
there is i won't call it reporting
but there is suggestion
and tucker carlson talked about it that
hunter biden was part of a an investment
group that invested in the bio labs in
ukraine
and that actually freaking literally
maybe all right this is an allegation
i'm not sure you could say this is a
fact
but that
there's a good chance
that literally
hunter biden may have funded some
biolabs now again it doesn't mean the
biolabs did anything wrong but let me
take it to
the seinfeld extreme
what's the next
thing that happens in this movie
the next thing that happens
is that we find out that the coronavirus
came out of a hunter biden found funded
ukrainian lab
now i don't think there's any chance
that that'll happen
but that would be that would be what the
movie would be
am i right because you're seeing these
weird unrelated stories about ukraine
and and we only have two stories in the
last five years
i got i guess we have two major stories
there's the coronavirus
and then there's the war with ukraine
do those stories come together
because it looks like they might and let
me tell you
can i propose something for you as a
test
in my opinion
there isn't really any chance that the
bio labs in ukraine are the source of
the coronavirus i don't think that's
possible
but would you agree with me
that if that ever came to be a fact
that you would accept that we live in
the simulation
go
would you take that as your your final
nail
that says yep okay you got me
you got me there's no way this happened
by accident
okay i didn't expect you all to to agree
and by the way you shouldn't agree with
that that's not something you should
agree with but i just wondered if people
would i saw a lot of yeses
yeah yes if that happens
you're gonna wonder about the nature of
reality
i take you back to one of my best
predictions of all time
2015
when i said that trump
would change more than politics
i said he would change how you saw
reality itself
in the comments how was that was that uh
a correct prediction
and remember i said it a lot because i
was quite sure of it
i said it a lot in 2015.
by the perspective of 2022 can we say
that was one of the best predictions
you've ever seen
i think so
i don't i don't think
because it was so out of um left field
wasn't it
it wasn't even something that was on
anybody's mind nobody was saying will it
will it change reality or will it not
nobody was talking about that
it wasn't even a sniff of an idea in
anybody's head and i could see it like a
bright light
i mean to me it was like looking at the
sun i mean i could see it so clearly i
was oh this isn't going to change
politics this is going to change
everything
and specifically what i saw
and maybe what i understood at that
point is that reality is way more
subjective
than the average person understands we
all understand that there's a subjective
nature to reality but you don't know the
degree
and what i saw was that trump was going
to change
what you thought about
facts
that he was going to change what you
thought was
true
and that you would never know what was
true after that point and that's what
happened that he would he would make you
unable to know what was true because he
would so definitely
show things that weren't true as true
and also here's the trick
he would tell you the things you
believed were true forever
weren't true and you would come to
believe it and you did
you did
so
that that's by far my best prediction i
would say
north korea
shot off a
cool new intercontinental ballistic
missile but the best part about it is
have you seen the video that north korea
itself made
so apparently
kim jong-un has lost a bunch of weight
and if i could if i could be objective
about it
it looks great
i hate to say it
you hate to say it
but um
he's developed sort of a
i guess a style
that actually works it totally works but
i love the fact that he seems to be
picking up tips from putin
tips from trump
and tips from hollywood so they produced
this almost top gun looking video where
you know you know in movies where you
see the cool guys maybe there are two or
three of them or more and they're cut
you know it's usually guys and they're
walking and behind them there's
something awesome
but they're just ignoring it they're
just they're just walking looking
awesome but behind them there's
something awesome so that they made they
made that video north korea did
so kim jong-un he's got a flight jacket
on he's got the aviator glasses looking
pretty sharp looking good actually lost
weight looks healthy and he's got two
generals they're looking like almost
cartoon generals because you know the
north korean outfits are so a little
over the top
and
and he and he's just you know walking in
front of this
enormous missile and there are lots of
video cuts where you see the thumbs up
and
it was actually great
you know
i've never been more convinced
that we should make you know we should
continue to be i guess
friendly with kim jong-un
because there's something very human
about that guy
you know monster though he may be
there's something very human about him
that trump accurately knew that the
human part was the way
in and so he took the human part hey
you're my friend i love you we're
friends
and then they worked
just treated them like friends now have
you noticed that
the news is not covering this like it's
a danger to the united states in any
real way i mean they do say
missile his nukes could reach the united
states but am i wrong that trump ended
this as a problem
i mean maybe it's a little problem
but it doesn't seem like we even treat
it as a problem it's more like a story
hey they got a good rocket how about
that
why would they shoot us
north korea doesn't have any reason to
aim a
nuke at us
what reason
so
yeah
so that's uh looking interesting uh i
love this story about uh italy
there's an italian shipyard where
there's a super yacht that's worth i
don't know 700 million dollars like just
it's like a city it's just like freaking
crazy
and the belief is it might be putin's
own yacht
um
and
uh
you know i saw the pictures of it it's
worth looking at the pictures it's
really yes that's really quite a yacht
now of course if it splits out they're
gonna you know stop it and i wondered
you know you think that the
the yacht stuff is sort of unimportant
don't you you think well if a
billionaire loses a yacht
make another
or something like that but there's
something in my mind
that says people being people
that taking taking putin's yacht that
probably has been 10 years in the making
he's probably imagined to have and you
know looking forward to being on his
yacht or taking the other oligar garx
yachts
probably makes a bigger difference than
you think
am i right
because it's just so personal
and if you're an oligarch nothing really
affects you
right little inflation ah
nothing can affect you yeah you can take
their cars they just buy another car but
if you take their yacht
they're a billionaire without any yacht
that feels like that would hurt
in in a weird way that a billionaire
could be hurt
so you and i don't think it's a big deal
because we don't care about a
billionaire it is young but i'll bet the
billionaire cares
so i i think this will be a great under
rated
uh technique
and if they get if they threaten putin's
yacht
i think that does increase the chance he
would make a peace deal
am i wrong
if you thought that that this was punjab
it was 700 million now he can afford it
so it's not really the money
but they probably had his mind
in the future on that yacht he probably
spent lots of meetings i'll bet he spent
a lot of meetings designing it
right
so he's probably
sort of emotionally and intellectually
invested in the future of him being on
the up if they say we're going to take
your yacht away if you don't make uh
peace
you don't think that would make a
difference
i mean it's not the difference
it would totally make a difference
there's nobody who would not be affected
by that
based on everything i know about
persuasion
putin would act like he wasn't caring
about it he would act like it he would
he would say i take my yacht i don't
care i'll make another one but you would
care
i definitely think you would care i
think would make a difference
all right
um
let's see if anything else is going on
mary pohl got completely destroyed as
you know in ukraine
and
i heard an anecdote of that the people
who were leaving
trying to escape the destruction had to
go through russian checkpoints and one
of the things the russians would check
is it would make you delete your photos
of the city that you're leaving that had
been completely destroyed
um
yeah everybody says that putin would be
okay without a yacht
you haven't been rich
i'll bet
uh back because if you're if you're
ability or there probably aren't that
many things that you can do that would
excite you
am i right do you think a billionaire
would get excited by a new car
well maybe the first two
but like
your third supercar
not much
but i do think a billionaire would be
excited
by their own yacht if it's the best
yacht in the world
i think
nobody would not be excited about that
so if you think that putin doesn't care
because ah he can always get another
yacht and he's got work to do anyway i
don't think so i think every human would
care about that
just my opinion
anyway i wonder if we'll ever see
pictures of mary pole if all the people
have to delete their pictures before
they leave
and i'm amazed that mary paul didn't
fall
they destroyed the whole thing to rubble
and the ukrainians are like
hey barely barely a flesh wound
amazing
um here's the thing that scares me most
in the world
fertilizer
it's the only thing i'm worried about
i'm not worried about nuclear war
not worried about inflation it's
terrible
but i think we have a way past it it'll
just be hard
but the fertilizer shortage is mass
starvation
mass starvation and the
the impact on food prices
i don't know how an economy can handle
that really
so
this is going to be another test of the
adams
law of slow moving disasters
i think i've told you maybe a few years
ago that we already had a fertilizer
shortage
so running on a fertilizer is something
we knew was a possibility for i don't
know 10 or 20 years
so does that mean that there's enough of
a
enough of a runway that we can do
something when there's a shock to the
system probably not not not quickly
but let me give you a little uh idea of
what's happening
did you know that if you do a vertical
farm which is an indoor farm in which
they they put the plants up a wall and
lots of different walls
that you would use uh
0.1 of the water land and fertilizer of
an outdoor farm
so you could reduce your fertilizer need
by 99.9
to grow indoors but what is the what is
the big problem with growing indoors
anybody anybody
don't need as much water don't need as
much fertilizer energy capital
uh not sun interestingly not
interestingly not sun
it's electricity
you know startup costs et cetera
so i don't know if this number holds but
one expert said that vertical farming is
still four to five times more expensive
and that mostly that's energy cost
uh can you imagine elon musk building a
vertical
farm prototype
that not only uses let's say solar
powers or something uh
but has a way to uh
to maybe maybe be more cost effective
and elan will build it in a tunnel
yeah uh it seems to me that we may have
a gigantic innovation wave coming in
vertical farms because i'm pretty sure
we have to grow everything indoors
eventually
climate change alone
variability of the weather et cetera and
let me ask you this if you build the
structure
and you get the energy cost down you're
done right
because the structure could probably
last a long time
and
as long as you get the energy costs so
basically
once again
climate change
becomes the problem because climate
change has is keeps the you know price
of a power high
the
at least the green
the green movement
has reduced uh fossil fuels keeps the
price high of energy
so
um
it seems that greta dunberg is really
found a way to destroy the entire world
in every way that you possibly can
because even our food costs will go
through the roof we won't have an
alternative
uh but here's what i think will happen
so it looks like um i would say there'll
be a tremendous wave of vertical farming
there are a number of uh
companies in this space
now i don't recommend
i do not recommend
investments
hear this clearly
this is not an investment recommendation
but apparently there are
um
there are funds
of just vertical growing companies
they're mostly smallish
so you can invest
in vertical farms
at a time when
i don't know if there would be a better
time to invest in a vertical farm
this might be the best time in the world
to
oh somebody's talking about seaweed
farms yeah that's another great
potential apparently you can turn
seaweed into all kinds of stuff
food products etc
and
uh
and that's probably another way to go so
here's my take on this
the unintended consequence of this war
reduce fertilizer
availability
pushes indoor vertical farming
um
long term
or better off
long term
so this is one of those weird wars i
guess a lot of them have this quality
where you don't want the war
but the war was the only thing that
caused the big change that turned out to
be good and longer so you need a war now
and then just to shake the box and
that's looks like that's what happened
with fertilizer
all right ladies and gentlemen
that is the end of my
prepared
comments
um
apparently you can i'm hearing you can
make everything from seaweed from
uh
food to
sexual lubricants
and that's why fish
are so happy
all right um
oh interesting there's a star trek about
that
co2 is a net benefit
uh net benefit to growing yes
it's easier to get fertilizer than to
achieve vertical farming that might be
but my understanding is that you need to
mine
uh one of the minerals right potassium
and that uh
we don't really have the availability at
least we don't know where there's
big mayans full of potassium i think
so
[Music]
um
vertical makes its own shade yeah
you can fix that with a mirror skin
all right
so
here's what i see coming
there's either going to be immense
starvation
coming well actually there's no way to
avoid that if you don't have enough food
what do you do
have you noticed that your grocery store
seems to have made some permanent
changes about products that are
available
and yeah yeah you wish you had those
other products but you got by
i know one possibility and this gets
back to the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters
think we'll adjust
i think we'll adjust sort of like year
2000
bug
it seemed like there was nothing you
could do but then yeah we figured down
no big deal
so i would suspect
that all over the world there are
alternative alternative food sources
that are trying to ramp up as quickly as
possible because they know it makes
sense
yeah we're we're good problem solvers so
we'll probably get through this but i do
think there will be some starvation at
risk
what i'd like to see is a way to grow
quinoa
and process it in my own house
so i get that good
get that good protein
quinoa is great especially if you mix it
with brown rice
all right um
yeah
somebody over here saying soylent green
whoever is saying soil in green you
might be new to this livestream you
might be unless you're joking
it's the matrix with soylent green
wrong altitude to grow quinoa is that
true
you need a certain altitude for quinoa
i wouldn't be surprised do you need a
high altitude for a quinoa
or a contextual joke okay
um
okay teresa is rejoicing in the lord
good for you
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
is all i have for you um with your
permission
and even without it
youtube i'm going to turn you off and
i'm going to talk to the locals people a
little bit more and uh sorry about the
sound if you had a real problem there
and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
[Music]
