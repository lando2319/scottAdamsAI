i hope i didn't violate any copyrights
with that
perfect rendition of
i think you all recognize it sing along
okay i'll wait for the chorus
there we go
well i think uh
this is going to be the best thing
you've ever seen in your life
um lots of evidence for it
lots of it and
you don't believe me yet you'll believe
me pretty soon
right after a little thing we call the
simultaneous sip if you'd like to
participate all you need is a copper
margarine glass set tanker chelsea style
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and you
my lucky lucky
listeners
you're here for it
my goodness what a good day this is go
i feel my dna being rewired but in a
constructive way
well um
for those of you who are on youtube
you may not be aware that i have a
locals community on the locals
site
and people who pass a subscription get
to see me make these micro lessons i
call them they're usually two to four
minute videos
that are designed to give you an actual
useful life skill
in a few minutes
so there are over 200 of them now
but
the one i did yesterday the locals
people considered
too valuable to be behind a subscription
wall
and i'm so glad they did
and by the way thank you
because after i had created it it was a
it was a micro lesson on reframing
stress and anxiety
so it'd be a bunch of little
simple mental tricks
and techniques and systems that you
could very easily incorporate to reduce
your stress and anxiety
and the people at locals thought it was
i i'm gonna i'm gonna over interpret
what they said
but thought it should be on youtube
because it would have a value outside
the subscription base so
as a philanthropic
um and i guess it would be sort of
weirdly indirectly philanthropic
the people on locals who actually pay
money for my content have decided that
you should see it too
so in this case the it's on youtube you
can see the link to it in my twitter
today so if there's anybody in your life
who can benefit
by reducing their stress and anxiety
there would be a bunch of tips there
that they can consume really easily
and remember the whole point of the
short videos
is to just get right to it and give you
something useful
here's the most
depressing thought of the day
will you tell me if i'm just old man
talking like an old man or if this is
true
and i know everybody my age is going to
think it's true
so this is the worst crowd i could ever
ask this question for a sanity track all
right here's the sanity check please
what the hell is wrong with kids
what the hell is wrong with them
can you imagine
your generation if you're my if let's
say you're my age-ish
can you imagine your generation not
having a mask rebellion yet
seriously
do you think my generation would have
put up with months and months of wearing
masks in school
i don't think so
how long would it have taken us to
simply all of us throw them away
what would happen if the entire class
threw their masks away at the same time
what they're going to close the school
what the hell are they going to do
what happens if all the school if
everybody says all right well if you're
going to put your mess away then you
have to do zoom school what happens if
everybody says what i'm not going to
turn it on
i'll just i won't turn on my computer
i'm going to school and i'm going
without a mask
i'm
am i crazy
am i crazy that my classmates
in my school would have worked this out
in
two weeks
i feel like i might be romanticizing you
know my childhood a little bit so that's
where you have to stop me
but
if i can be blunt
the kids are a bunch of
you telling me that there's a bunch of
14 to 17 year old kids who can't get
their together enough to tell their
teachers to go themselves
and get rid of the masks and just throw
them away
do you think their parents are going to
put up the fight that will change their
minds
all they have to do is do it at the same
time
it's not rocket science
just do it at the same time
nobody can get in trouble
nobody zero risk
zero risk
if they just do it at the same time
and they can't organize that have you
heard of social media there's this thing
called snapchat
tick tock i believe it's a way for young
people to talk with each other
and you can't work out a single day to
throw your masks away at the
same time and just be done with it
it's time kids
it's time
did you lose all of your fight
i mean seriously
like
what is going on here now and i'm not
even saying
you know what is what is good or bad or
when it should have happened i'm just
i'm just astonished
that there's no fight left
in kids what happened is that the
brainwashing or the
change in diets or
what
i don't know
so
here's some tragic news for a company
called spotify
who who made a huge mistake
of uh working with the most popular
podcaster in the history of civilization
um
and now they've lost first they lost
neil young
if anybody is a certain age you might
have to google him and joni mitchell
again google her and uh now nils lofkin
apparently
uh but
that's not the end of it
mary trump
she's removing her podcast from spotify
now i know what you're thinking
mary trump had a podcast
but
i don't know how spotify is going to
weather the storm
you know and i have to say that uh
unlike the children
they do have a little fight in them
and
uh spotify seems to be i think they're
gonna i don't think they're gonna cave
i think they're actually gonna take this
pressure
i mean
spotify
that takes guts and standing up for
freedom
i don't know how you can take that hit
but i'm glad you are weird news of the
day
in a tweet by uh battia angar sargon i
saw
that of all things
tell me if you saw this coming this is
what i did not see coming would not have
guessed this
that tucker carlson is pulling in more
young democrat viewers
than cnn or msnbc individually
so here are the here are the numbers
according to this tweet anyway
fox news got 42 of democrats aged 25 to
54
the ones you want right that's the exact
age you want
so in the age that mattered most to
advertisers
you got 42 percent of democrats cnn only
got 33 percent of democrats
now remember
fox news also has you know huge numbers
in general
so they have you know more of every
category but i didn't think they would
have more democrats
how many of you knew who knew that i
mean specifically for tucker carlson let
let me be uh
um
yeah carl and car well carlson was
top among democrats in the demo across
all cable news
tucker carlson
is the top thing watched by democrats
what am i reading this wrong carlson was
top among democrats in the demographic
across all cable news and ranked
third among democrats in total
viewership
so i guess you throw in the old people
and the younger people that changes it
oh wow
so
what how do you explain that
somebody says hate watching i don't
think it's hate watching
you know what i think it is
i think it is uh
uh distrusting the government is just
popular everywhere
don't you think
i mean the if you had to say what is
tucker carlson's
um
political view
like if you were on the left you'd
probably say he's a republican
if you're a republican you might say
i don't know i mean he seems sometimes
surprising
but you know more on the conservative
side for sure libertarian i think a
little closer to the libertarian right
but
if your message is the government is
screwing you and you can't trust anybody
uh there's a there's an audience for
that
apparently there's a big audience for
that but you but you also have to be
i don't think you can ignore the fact
i've said this a billion times
fox just has better production values
it's just a better produced show and i
would say that
tucker stands out
among you know the crowd of people who
do what he does i think at the moment he
does it better than anybody else
would you agree with that
let's say on on cable news just just
cable news alone
i i feel like even if you disagree with
him
the just the performance the thinking
the
provocation the i don't know just the
talent that goes into it the writing
um
it feel it feels like almost every part
of it
is just a little bit above
who he's competing with
so it doesn't surprise me that people
were drawn to not only quality of their
program
um in a technical sense
but also the message of not trusting the
government that's so that's my view
right that
that's my
best my best hypothesis for what's going
on
payroll is down surprisingly we're
expecting that
the number of people who were on the
payroll to go up but it went down quite
a bit
and why is that well here's some
speculation with no numbers behind it
just speculation
so for this is my own speculation and
mark schneider had an idea here i'm
going to throw in
um somebody on twitter mentioned vaccine
mandates
do you think the vaccine mandates
would be a reason the payroll is down
how about as this is what mark schneider
added how about the return to
single-family incomes
i was sort of expecting this
i i feel that a number of people said
you know
maybe only one of us needs to go back to
work but you know it's 20 22 so
you know whichever one doesn't matter
so i think it'll be
more single family less traditional you
know the dad's working mom at home but
probably still a lot of that right still
a majority probably
um
so that's that's that's it
but i'll bet it's also hard to hire
so here's another old man yelling at the
clouds thing and you really have to fact
check me on this stuff
because i'm
i'm somewhat hyper aware
that there's some point in my future
where i can only see things through an
old man lens
and i'm just going to lose the ability
to you know see life in a normal way
because it feels like it happens to
everybody so why would i be the
exception
but here's what i'm thinking
i've never seen so many people in the
young working age category
who are incapable of holding a job
is that new
can you can you do you see this just in
your personal life
do you see the number of people who
for different reasons and anxiety is
often one of them
um
for whatever reason
didn't get whatever that base
the base capability is
and i'm not sure that they're you know
different genetically
than anybody ever was so i wonder if
it's partly
that the environment got more
complicated
or are people different so here's the
question did the
the environment get too complicated and
there's some people who just you know
they're not built for that level of uh
let's say stimulation
and they're just over stimulated and
it's like paralyzing
um or is there something in the water is
there something in the diet
but if
is it the just the schools are bad at
teaching
you know i would say somebody's saying
the soy but it's not like it's only boys
are being affected right
no competition somebody says
i don't know
i i don't really have any
speculation and i'm also not not sure
it's true
oh drugs
drugs maybe
although i haven't seen drugs being
directly implicated implicated although
yeah i guess so
yeah i guess it would be a combination
of a whole bunch of stuff
all right
here's some
cnn fake news
so uh
they're reporting that the tennessee
school board
banned uh a comic about the holocaust uh
so rats are portrayed as people and it's
sort of a holocaust-y theme
and it so they banned these books in the
i guess the libraries
then the school the school libraries
because of the books uh quote
unnecessary use of profanity and nudity
and its depiction of violence and
suicide
and then the cnn commentary here opinion
is as though it would be possible to
depict one of
one of the you know the most violent
events of the last century without
violence
now
what is wrong with banning a book
for having too much violence and sex in
it if it's a school
is that new
like are
could you put you know copies of
penthouse back when there were copies of
penthouse
could you just put porn
in the school library
i i'm pretty sure we've always had
restrictions
about
levels of violence and um
and nudity
and sexual stuff right
am i wrong
now even though it's a classic yeah i
know in this genre it's
it's it's a classic
but why is this even news is it news
i mean that's a serious question isn't
this just the most ordinary thing
and
i think that the uh the political part
of this is that because it's about the
holocaust
maybe it would be denying kids you know
some history about the holocaust
but
i don't feel like that's really going to
be skipped
are they skipping the holocaust and
history
now you need a comic to do it i don't
know it just feels like a non-story that
turned into a story
so
can you believe that the biden
administration is
going to appoint a havana syndrome
coordinator
so havana syndrome the thing that as far
as we can tell never happened and
doesn't exist is probably a
psychological disorder although there
could be actual physical disorders
caused by something but unlikely to have
been caused by a directed energy attack
but we have a sitting senator a democrat
nothing that matters
in this case
senator jeanne shaheen who tweeted for
too long americans affected by directed
energy attacks
what
what
i guess this is a big problem in their
world
americans affected by directed energy
attacks have struggled and fought to
access the care they need and deserve to
get well
their experiences drove my effort to
establish this coordinator and reform
our government response to provide
equitable blah blah blah
so there's a senator who believes that
it's proven enough that she can just
tweet it out like fact
that there was a directed energy attack
at the
at the very least
it's not proven
can we all agree on that at the very
least
it's not proven there was a you know
it's not in evidence
there's some suspicion
and now the the latest the latest i i've
seen is that it's been debunked
but you know debunked doesn't mean the
the debunk is right either
um
so
i don't doubt that people have actual
medical problems i just don't know that
this is a source and i think it's weird
that we're going to have a
a coordinator for a mass hysteria
as if it had been real
and you know it would be hilarious
hypothetically
what if trump gets reelected
work with me on this hold
what if trump gets elected
and then uh appoints a uh trump
derangement syndrome coordinator
to try to try to figure out
how to collectively deal with the damage
that's been done to people who are
suffering from trump derangement
syndrome
the source
i think the source of the trump
derangement syndrome
is a directed
energy weapon
now that directed energy weapon is the
press and the fake news
but
you'd have to admit that the press is
directing its energy
directed energy
at the people's skulls who are consuming
the fake news
the directed energy
and that is causing them in many cases
correct me if i'm wrong
give me a fact check on this
actual verifiable
mental illness
bam
right
trump could literally do this
now
we wouldn't want to see a budget for
that person right i wouldn't want to
spend money on it
but
it would be hilarious
and it would be completely defensible
because if the news reported on it and
they tried to say how ridiculous it was
they would still have to talk to the
experts wouldn't they
what would the experts say
what would the experts say would they
say there's no such thing
as people having mental illness
from the time of trump
no they wouldn't say that
i'm pretty sure the experts would
confirm that something like trump
derangement syndrome absolutely exists
and then we'd have to talk about where
it came from
wouldn't we
[Laughter]
and of course we'll never agree where it
came from but wouldn't it be hilarious
if trump made the conversation about
where you got the trump derangement
syndrome instead of whether or not it
exists
i mean it would just be too perfect
and even better than doing it for real
better than doing it for real
would be to do it on the campaign trail
and say he's going to do it but you
don't know if it's he's kidding or not
because you think he might actually do
that and then the press wouldn't know if
he's kidding
so they'd report it like he wasn't
kidding
but they wouldn't be sure
and then that would be the story itself
whether he was kidding or not kidding it
would be just the ultimate campaign
thing to say
a trump derangement syndrome coordinator
to bring help to those who were damaged
by the fake news
and then back it up with examples when
somebody says that's crazy you say well
did you or did you not report x y and z
and if somebody thought those things
were true
shouldn't they feel distressed about
them
i'd feel distressed if i thought those
things were true
so it's a wonderful uh just persuasive
message just for fun
here's a thought
if climate change causes a whole bunch
of problems
that have to be
remediated it's going to cost a lot of
money right
so you know there have been economic
projections now
if you can release on the question of
whether climate change is real i know
you're all going to be hey it's not real
forget about that for a moment
because that's not important to the
point
if it were true
if it were true that there will be
massive economic displacement
because of climate change
how do you
fix that
let's say it's going to happen it's too
late to stop it
which
the experts are telling us right they're
already saying it's too late to stop
pretty big economic problems
it's not too late maybe to stop even
bigger ones but but pretty much the
consensus and i know you don't you don't
agree
but hold that thought because that's not
the conversation
it's not about whether you agree with
that
i'm just saying hypothetically if there
were big economic displacement
what would you have to do necessarily to
fix it
well you have to spend a lot of money
am i right
but more ironically it would take a
great deal of energy
literally
oil and coal
and green energy and nuclear and every
other kind of energy and since we don't
have as much green energy or nuclear as
we need
nuclear being green too
where would you get it
so i feel as though you've got it's just
a question i haven't seen addressed that
if you have to fix all the economic
displacement
it would necessarily mean a whole bunch
of energy increase
which would also
uh
make the climate worse right
i guess the only question is if you have
a long-range
80 you know 80-year economic model
is anybody doing it right
or could it even be done right
you know
is it just safe to say this is sort of a
jordan peterson take as well
that if you're looking at a you know 100
year model
it doesn't matter how
how
good you are at modeling you're not
going to get it right it's just not a
thing but i wonder about the feedback
thing
that um and let me now simplify that
whole point that i should have started
with
there are some who say
that your well-being is directly related
to how much energy you could use or
that's available to you cheaply
maybe that's all you need to know
well what if what if the only thing we
did
is we just ignored the climate and
everything else i'm not saying i'm just
this is just a mental exercise what if
you just ignored everything
and focused on one rule
and the one rule was this
the more
energy you can provide for everybody at
the cheapest cost
the better everybody will be in the long
run
i have a feeling it is that simple
that you could ignore all the models and
all the everything and just try as hard
as you could to drive down the cost of
energy and also to produce more of it
in every way that you could
like
get as much oil as you can
because you know if you boost the
economy of a
of any place
it's going to do better you know against
any climate change risks
so
i feel as if we have all this
complication because there are people
whose jobs it is
to do complicated stuff
right
the scientists have to do complicated
stuff
or else what's the point of being a
scientist that's what they do they do
the complicated stuff so you probably we
probably get drawn into
thinking things are way more complicated
than they should be
because there are people whose job it is
to say hey you better pay me because i
can do this complicated stuff and you
can't
but it might be
a simple economic truth that more energy
equals more better all the time every
time
and i would love to see
some economist or especially an
economist who's involved in any kind of
climate change you know i i i guess i
should have asked that question of uh
bjorn lomborg right he would be the
right kind of person to ask that
question
is it true
just generally speaking that more energy
more cheaply is just always is the right
answer no exception
it might be
i'll just put it out there uh if i were
running for president i think i'd be
saying that
i did uh my masculist experiment i on
february 1st here was my result in mass
required
california i was the only maskless
shopper in my supermarket and it was
pretty crowded there were a lot of
people there
not a single problem
i just didn't wear one and nobody said
anything now i did use the self-checkout
because i i was going for a soft target
here
it was more important for me to get in
and get out without being challenged
than it was to you know make any
specific thing happen so i wanted to use
the self-checkout
but of course the self-checkout never
works
so or there's always some problem so i
end up interacting with a masked
employee of the supermarket
who stood next to me with her mask on
and said nothing about the fact that i
didn't have one
now
do you think
half of the people looked at me and said
you magnificent bastard
i wish i could do that
and half of them said you're going to
kill my grandmother
maybe i don't know i couldn't tell
i would just tell you that i couldn't
detect
anything except me walking around
and
if i have to be honest i'm not exactly
the kind of person that gets challenged
in my town
so it's not really a fair test
if i may throw some
systemic racism at you
it is a true thing
that people who look like me
don't get challenged in a town like mine
let me give you an example
if i saw a construction site
i could walk into the middle of the
construction site and the people
wouldn't stop me
they would assume i was in charge
it's true
i could talk myself past any security
it's true do you think do you think i've
ever been stopped by security
and couldn't get through like ultimately
couldn't get through no
no
no
it is literally true that i'm in that
exact demographic
that looks like you should be ruling the
world because systemic racism right
and so people just sort of assume
that i'm trouble
not trouble like physically
but i just look like i'm not going to
challenge that guy he's probably got
he's probably got
an ace up his sleeve right
so i have a feeling that when i walk
through safeway
i don't get the same challenge i might
be if i were 20 years old
am i right
if i were 20 years old do you think
somebody would have told me to put a
mask on
i bet they would have
maybe more likely
anyway so i tried it in a few different
corporate chains and the the private
private companies are all masculine at
this point for all practical purposes
uh nobody wears a mask at their home
nobody wears masks to socialize nobody's
telling their kids to stay home because
of covid i mean basically
masking's over if you want it to be
so here's my point
masking is optional in california it's
it's over now if you would like to push
it harder if you're in a state that
wants to push it i think it is now fair
to give a bad yelp review
to any business that challenges you on
being massless
not a bad yelp review for requiring it
because that's usually just putting the
sign up
you know i don't i don't care what sign
somebody puts up
but at this point
you know and i wouldn't have said this
earlier in fact i didn't want to
recommend this earlier because i think
yelp is like a it's a nuclear weapon
you don't want to use that one
yelp will take a business out
it's it's really bad if you get yelped
this is one of the reasons that i
couldn't own a restaurant
if somebody was mad at me for something
i did in my public life
they would go to yelp and give my
restaurant they had nothing to do with
anything
a bad review
and if you have a bad review on yelp
you're dead if you're a local restaurant
you're just dead
so
so people had the ability to put me out
of business and
that's kind of what happened
i mean there are other stories for why
being in restaurants a bad business but
you couldn't i couldn't get past the bad
yelp reviews from the people who were
mad at me for other reasons basically
so yelp is that powerful it was powerful
enough to completely change my business
life
that's how powerful it was and i figure
i have you know my own power so it's not
like i'm a powerless
individual in society as i just said
and yelp took me out
no problem
so
if there's a business now uh don't give
them a bad review about you know some of
their service or something just be
specific but it'll show up and it will
get their attention
anyway uh
schools across america are implementing
some kind of blm
week of action
and one of the i guess controversial
parts is that the blm is calling for a
quote disruption of western nuclear
family
well that doesn't sound good let's dig
into this a little bit
um and return to the quote collective
village that takes care of each other so
this is part of a starter kit
for schools that want to be teaching the
blm week of action stuff
now here is my persuasion advice
i know you're going to hate this
but i
almost sort of kind of agree with blm
but the way they're saying it
makes it sound like nothing you could
possibly agree with
here's what they should have said and
maybe i'm interpreting it wrong
but i think this is what they would want
if a nuclear family works well for you
go ahead and do it but
there are lots of people for whom it
doesn't work and won't work and a lot of
them are called children
for children
you might have one parent who is an
addict
so there are probably lots of people who
just
through no fault of their own
just the nuclear family isn't working so
they need some kind of extra village
help right
so
um don't get mad at me for
thinking that
the nuclear family is the best
institution
you all agree with that right
that the nuclear family when it works
right
i think everybody would agree it's the
best does anybody disagree with that the
in the ideal situation you know your
parents are functional and you've got
enough money you live in a nice place i
don't think you could beat that
but would you also agree that not
everybody could achieve it
realistically you know the number of
people could hit that would be
25
i'm thinking
you know i say 25 because there's
another 25 percent that pretends they're
happy
but they're not
so if you actually could know secretly
in people's heads whether things are
working or not
i think that nuclear family thing
i mean what the odds of getting one good
parent
what are the odds of that
not that high right 50 50.
the odds of getting one good period
about 50 50. now what are the odds that
you get two good parents
when the odds of getting one is 50 50.
25
right
so there's a 25 percent just just based
on the awfulness of people
that you're going to get some at least a
below average experience
and then one of them is an addict and
blah blah so um so i'm only making a
persuasion um suggestion here
so
don't get mad at me for doing something
that sounds like i support blm if you
haven't heard my
you know the full breadth of my opinions
i think black lives matter has been a
scam organization
even though they had good intentions by
the people
but i think the leaders
at this point are obviously just
scammers
so
uh don't use the word disruption just
say you're augmenting you're improving
that would be better
here's another persuasion thing about
school choice
i guess to uh a representative who was
talking to a senator i don't didn't see
what the setting was
it doesn't matter to the point but it
looked like some congressional kind of
debate thing
and uh represent representative
noyen i hope i'm pronouncing that right
asked another asked another
representative i'll get to that says why
don't
private schools have the same level of
accountability and scrutiny as our
public schools
and
the answer from representative cantrell
was quote and here's the here's the kill
shot this is done so well he goes you're
right
they don't have the same level of
accountability they have a much higher
level of accountability
families have the freedom to leave
and i thought
well yeah we're done here
we're done here that's the high ground
the high ground maneuver is
accountability is the only way you get
anything done
am i right who's going to argue with
that statement
having accountability
is the only way anything's ever worked
there's no exception
so
at what is more accountable than people
can say well screw this i'll take my
money somewhere else
you couldn't get more accountable
so if somebody's arguing for a school
choice
representative
cantrell is either a natural
like he just might be just a great
communicator i don't know i don't know
anything else about him but the way he
so um so succinctly put this it's the
succinct part that's the impressive part
you know having the idea is something
you've all thought of am i right
you know just knowing that that's true
is something you've all thought of so
it's not that
novel but how he boiled it down
was
you know it's the highest level of
accountability
families have the freedom to leave
you're done
that's perfect writing and perfect
speaking
so i just point that out as good
persuasion
and i would also say that you can always
tell the republican in a conversation
even without them being labeled
do you know how
the republican's the one who's making an
appeal to how human incentives and
motivation works
and the democrat is the one who's acting
like they forgot that variable
if you didn't you know i saw the video
before i knew the political parties but
you know it's just ins
as you as soon as you see one talk about
motivation
uh and incentive
you know market forces and the other one
acting like they don't even understand
that
you know the parties
so biden's doing this cancer moonshot
he's resurrecting it they had this
during obama biden administration
and i guess it's mostly funding to get
and he's got a aggressive goal of
reducing cancer death rates by 50
um
pretty good
i mean i like the fact
that he's
taking a shot at it but
so so let me say this from a i don't
know i'm assuming that funding it is
going to help
apparently cancer rates death rates have
fallen quite a bit 25 and last
uh what what yeah it's
we've already brought cancer death rates
down quite a bit
so i'm saying this is probably a
reasonably good thing it's a high
priority
all right
it's a high priority
so giving it more money sounds good on
paper
here's the political persuasion problem
and
you have to respect him for doing it
anyway
you don't want your you don't want to be
associated with cancer
i don't even like to talk about it on
the live stream
because
in fact that's the last time i'll say it
so i'm not going to use the word again
and that that will make my point
our brains
we can process some things semilogically
but it's not how the brain is wired the
brain is wired by association
so the brain just associates things oh
this is like this it's like that it's
different from this it's like that
and
he
for biden having this uh
moonshot of this word i'm not going to
say out loud because i don't want to
associate with it
um
even though it's important even though
it's a top priority even though i would
uh compliment him for having
good sense of priorities i guess
it's politically really bad
politically it's just a loser i don't
think trump would ever do this
even if you think it's a good idea i
think his political instinct would
steer away from it
um rasmussen netapol is asking is biden
the best or worst president
and uh or is he one of the best or one
of the worst presidents and 54 percent
in the rasmussen poll
said that biden is one of the worst
trump at uh was only 43 percent
so uh way more people think that uh
biden is the worst which means that he's
picking up a lot of democrats right
so at this point
at this point there are a lot of
democrats we're not liking joe biden
uh and and obama did better than both of
you only 33
thought he was one of the worst
so here here's the progression
of
people who thought they were one of the
worst
33 percent
43 percent
54 percent do you think it's actually
the president
or is there something else going on
what else was happening during this
period
what was the other large force
the other large force was the social
media and
and fake news
as social media and fake news got more
polarizing
we started to hate our presidents more
now it could be a coincidence
that the last three of our presidents
started out relatively awesome and just
got progressively worse
it could be
and then the people noticed and they
answered the poll
could be
we'll rule it out i mean it doesn't look
that way to me but i won't rule it out
um
but i think a better interpretation of
this
is that everything worked looks worse
because the the nature of social media
and the nature of the fake news business
just everything looks worse
so my guess would be that our next
president no matter who it is
uh will set a new record as the worst of
the worst
democrat or republican it won't make any
difference
it will be
i think our next president is going to
be uh
both a racist and
uh
mentally incompetent
so it's the only way you can get even
worse um could you tell me did i did i
say yesterday that there was yet another
big study that says
moderate drinking is not good for you
did i mention that yesterday
i didn't mention it yesterday well
there's another big study that says
moderate drinking
it's not good for you and that if you
ever thought it was it's because the
numbers were done wrong
now um and so i did a google search
oh somebody says yes though oh two days
ago i did two days ago again yeah
um one of my best predictions but one of
my other best predictions
is that when the
pandemic was over
that leadership wouldn't matter
in other words we would look we wouldn't
see a difference in uh leadership as
changing the your numbers
and um i'm gonna lay
lay a claim down that the one and only
place you can see a clear signal for
leadership
was uh trump's warp speed
and arguably uh closing
closing traffic to china but i don't
know if we can measure that exactly
now here's the thing
you also have the benefit of being able
to measure some things better than
others
okay
so whatever you can measure is always
going to seem like a more important
thing because you have more certainty
about it
so because we we know who gets us
vaccinated we know if they die
you know even though the data is bad
it does look according to the official
data
and i know i know this is before all
your your alleged uh vaccine blood clots
you know wipe out america or whatever is
going to happen so we don't know the
long run yet
but in the short run
uh the latest i saw in today was there
is 16 times more vaccinated people in
hospitals in america
in december
than
vaccinated
16 times more unvaccinated than
vaccinated in the hospital in december
now if that's true
or even true ish
let's say it's just eight to one right
let's say the numbers are terrible but
it's delayed to one
that is a big effect that can be
measured at least in the short run now
remember i said
the leadership that would matter the
most
if you think it was a huge mistake and
it's going to kill us all it still
mattered the most right
so my point is matter to the most i
don't want to argue with you about what
was a good or bad idea can we get away
from that
i'm not saying the vaccinations are a
good or bad idea let's forget about that
just what had an impact
and i'm saying that nobody else really
impacted anything
that all the the lockdowns apparently
the numbers are all over the place
on that oh by the way there's a
new study you know a uh
meta study about the lockdowns
they showed that they didn't work
but really they did work except they
didn't work except it was a better study
except the date is bad but it worked
except in the cases where it didn't work
and then the bad study that was
ridiculous
so
we don't know anything about lockdowns
but we do know that the signal was not
clear
right
you could still argue uh you know maybe
in some cases the lockdown's made some
yeah and and there's some indication
that maybe closing the bars might have
made a difference
but
you the one thing we'd all agree on is
there's no clear data
right there's no clear data
this says the lockdowns worked
am i right
can we can we get a fact check on that
because i'm not positive i'm right but i
think i'm right
well
and that if there's a small effect you
know that wouldn't necessarily be worth
the cost
so
of the things we can measure just fact
check me on this of the things we can
measure
the vaccinations have the biggest impact
again i'm not saying good or bad but the
biggest thing you can measure
and that was trump
now some of you could say oh wait you
know desantis
is a clear example of good leadership
but here's the catch
desantis's leadership um
at least in terms of staying open was
more about not doing something
and i'm not sure his numbers were really
that different from anybody else's we do
like the fact he protected the elderly
we liked his regeneron thing well while
that was
working with delta
so he did he did a lot of stuff right
but it's not you don't see it in the
numbers
that's my point
even if even if i grant you and i think
it is true the desantis
may have hit every note right he may
have hit every note
i don't think it made much difference
but the vaccinations did
even if they end up killing you they
made a difference
so i think that was my uh
two of my least
likely predictions
that moderate drinking i think i made
this 15 years ago the first time i said
it or 25 years ago probably that there
was no way that moderate drinking was
going to be good for you
and that leadership wouldn't matter in
the pandemic
except the one example of and and
there's also indication that maybe even
warp speed would have happened anyway
maybe
like anybody would have done it if they
had been president we don't know that to
be true but we do give credit to the
person who did it
that's the way it works so that was
trump
all right let's have to talk about
whoopi goldberg
so if you're not up to date on this
whoopi was talking about the holocaust
and said something like it wasn't about
race it was uh she said quote it's about
man's inhumanity to man that's what it's
about and uh she argued i think that
um
when when anna navarro said uh but it's
about white supremacists going after
jews and gypsies
then goldberg
attempted to speak over said but these
are two white groups of people according
to whoopi goldberg
well she apologized for that because
people explained to her that
during the holocaust certainly
the nazis believed that the jews were a
different race
so we could argue about what race means
but i don't think we could argue that
that's the way the
germany was interpreting it at the time
or at least the nazis
and
so once whoopi was
you know
got this clarification
she issued an apology
which showed that she understood you
know the impact it had
it uh
she explained you know that she had
become better informed
sounds good and she apologized in a way
that i i took as sincere
would you say that her apology
uh hit the forum and was timely
you know i have the 48-hour rule that
says if you apologize in 48 hours
you should be forgiven no exceptions
if it's just words right you know not if
you kill somebody but if it's just words
and you correct and clarify in 48 hours
forgiven
so according to the 48-hour rule whoopi
is forgiven but according to her
employer
the biggest bunch of cowardly
i've heard of lately
she got suspended
now
you can't be a little bit wrong in
america
you can't be wrong
and then correct it and apologize
on a opinion show
are you kidding me
she's she's an opinion person who gives
opinion on an opinion show
she gives an opinion on an opinion show
that disagrees with some other opinions
changes her opinion on the opinion show
clarifies and apologizes sincerely and
correctly i mean hit form nice form
and she gets suspended
you cowardly pieces of
talk about blowing a public relations
opportunity do you know how this could
have worked
this is how this should have worked
we all learned something about the
holocaust
this was the opposite of a negative
anything
everything about this was positive until
they suspended
the person who caused the positive thing
to happen
do you know why people have different
opinions and then talk about it on tv
it's so you can get smarter
that's the whole point
and what happened she had an opinion
other people had an opinion she revised
her opinion and you got smarter
i mean i'm not sure that i'd ever
thought about that
specific question but that filled in a
little filled in a little context for me
oh yeah of course they would have called
it race back then but
you know maybe our definitions of race
have changed or whatever
this is this is the most horrifyingly
incompetent
uh
response i've ever seen from a
corporation i mean just who
compare this to joe rogan's
response to his controversy you know i
gave joe rogan an a plus
literally a steve jobs level comparison
you don't get any better than that that
you know that's the standard of how to
do it
and then abc news's pr department tweets
out this horse yet
about somebody who clearly is not a
racist
i mean i mean come on
yo
whoopi goldberg she she's suspended
for being a racist or saying something
that i guess was insensitively
accidentally racist or something
abc news you are so
incompetent
really the entire whoever came up with
this idea of how to deal with they
should all be fired
well i can't believe that there's a ceo
who looked at this
i wonder if the ceo was even involved
let me give you a hypothesis
i'm going to give you a very
weird hypothesis
i don't think the ceo is involved
and i think he might reverse it who's
the ceo now
who's the ceo of uh
disney
didn't that just changed recently right
who's the ceo of disney
uh
come on somebody's gonna tell me
chappic
uh
is that bob is it shapic or chappic
well here's the thing
that this is this is what i
in my opinion
on my opinion live stream
the ceo probably didn't see this
i think he didn't see it
and here's why i think he didn't see it
you don't become the ceo of disney by
being a idiot
and this decision is idiot
territory
this is what somebody who learned public
relations does
this isn't ceo this is not
ceo level thinking
how many people would agree with me
this looks like yeah this looks like
human resources doesn't it
am i right
i mean maybe the ceo got pushed into it
somehow but
no there's no way that
i this is my prediction my new
prediction the ceo did not
have a let's say a
strong input on the decision something
else is going on
all right
uh let's talk about uh
long covid risk so there's a story in
wall street journal
and it starts out by saying that uh
asthma asthma
unhealthy gut bacteria the presence of
auto antibodies
and some other things can predict
whether you'll have this thing called
long covet
and then in the body of the story
there's a completely different story so
if anybody works for the wall street
journal
i don't know if i missed it
but the headline said the asthma was one
of the four things and then the story
doesn't
so
i think you've got a headline story
mismatch
or
or i'm a bad reader it wasn't a hurry
yeah
but
given that i have asthma i would like to
know
if
i have a risk of a long covet but
according to the body of it it's all
these other things one of them is that
you might reactivate your epstein bar so
that your your long covet is actually
the epstein bar kicking the out of
you
maybe some people have addison's disease
some people have some kind of autoimmune
condition that isn't so bad normally but
i guess pushed over the edge
somebody said
yes anyway
that
ladies and gentlemen is all i have to
say today
and
um
the question is scott can we reframe
critical race theory as a religion
no
that never works
people have been tried to do that
reframe forever
science it's just a religion
you know it makes a good bumper sticker
and stuff but nobody's ever been
persuaded by because i think people just
know what a religion is and what it's
not and you know
and they're not going to change their
minds on that
and
plus people have a positive view of
religion
so when i say alcohol is poison
that's a good reframe
because nobody likes poison
but people do like religion
so if you say oh a critical race theory
that's like a religion
people like oh i didn't realize it was
that good
um
can i get a micro lesson on getting past
security
well look like me i guess
be an old bald guy with glasses that
helps
um
is it a good strategy to back what the
left hates the most uh like trump
probably not
um
based on our comments oh here's the
interesting comment
so michael says based on her comments i
think whoopi goldberg isn't particularly
fond of jews
i feel as though that's a little mind
reader-ish
i mean
you know if you if you accuse a public
figure of not being fond of jews
you better bring a link
you better break a link
i take that a little bit personally
honestly
because you know that's some that
happens to me just people throw out some
wild accusation and then somebody sees
it in the comments and that's all
they've ever seen on the topic
you better bring a link if you have an
accusation like that because we don't
live in a world where that's safe to do
like you're actually you're creating an
unsafe environment
for a public figure when you do that
kind of stuff
you know i'm in favor of free speech
so i'm not saying you need to get banned
for saying what you're saying that's
different kind of conversation i'm
saying as a as a point of
personal responsibility
don't put that out there
unless you can back it up if you can
back it up then please do because you
know that would be worth seeing
um
would mushrooms help someone with
addiction i'm going to tell you to
google that
because i don't like to
delve into anything that would look like
a medical recommendation so i never
recommend you know marijuana or
mushrooms i might tell you if i've had
an experience with them but i wouldn't
recommend them
you know
that that's a medical thing and why
would i do that
all right
um
looking at some of your comments now
steven spielberg launched whoopee's
career
uh why is whoopee clearly not a racist
well i'm just saying that she wouldn't
be on the view if she were
would you agree with that
when i say it's clear that whoopi is not
a racist i mean in the in the classic
sense
not not in the let's say
expanded sense that um
you could be racist against white people
not in that sense i don't have an
opinion on that because i don't know
what she said about that
but but in the sense that um the
mainstream would consider her
classically
you know
non-racist
i think she fits that category perfectly
yeah and what are the one of the chances
her last name would be goldberg it's
like the simulation is just
serving up
this perfect thing
you know and this is another case of
people being offended on behalf of other
people
so we've we've gone through this entire
whoopi goldberg story
but was there anybody who was actually
offended or were we all worried that
somebody else would be offended
was that the worry
somebody else would be offended because
usually
most offense is third party offense
right i am pretty sure that somebody i
don't know who doesn't have quite the
sense of humor that i do somebody with a
thin skin not like me i've got a thick
skin
criticism rolls off my back but let me
protect
those weak people back there right
there's nobody behind me well i'm sure
there was somebody back there the moment
before
and that person was deeply offended by
that horrible thing you did not somebody
like me who has a sense of humor and a
thick skin
all right let me see a counter to that
uh
so cole says no plenty of jewish people
uh were offended
deborah messing was pretty explicit
explicit
i'll bet
if you read
so there was a specific encounter
example
deborah messing i'll bet if i read her
comment
it wouldn't strike me that way
but
send it to me
uh
yeah and and i this is also a special
case right
because where the holocaust is involved
there's not only were you personally
offended
but
does it make you feel let's say more
vulnerable
if the holocaust narrative is attacked
so i feel like there's a complication
there that
that would be different from saying
somebody was actually offended
somebody might have let's say they're
they're safety offended
i guess that would be another way to say
that she might feel that her
sense of
security as you know a jewish person in
the world might be offended by it
any
any little attack on it
ben shapiro appeared pretty offended but
again
but again
i will bet if you if you asked him
privately i can't read his mind right so
let me let me have some humility about
being able to read the mind of somebody
who's smarter than i am
that's always the worst thing
at least with ben shapiro i can somewhat
confidently say he's smarter than i am
so trying to read the mind of somebody
or like understand
like exactly what they're thinking in
their private thoughts
if i could think what he was thinking in
my private
if i knew what ben shapiro was thinking
i would be as smart as ben shapiro
but i'm pretty sure i've not
so um but i'll bet
uh here's my bet
that it's not so much that he was
personally offended in
in some way that you know his his body
was having some stress
i feel like it was more like the you
know more of a philosophical point that
maybe he had some energy about but
that's just a guess
yeah i probably shouldn't even try to
you should erase that i i shouldn't try
to characterize anybody's probable
opinion that's
that that's some unfair territory
but but i guess that what i think of ben
shapiro
is that his um
his personal ability to be offended must
be pretty high
because you can't you can't do this kind
of work
if you're easily offended so it's hard
to imagine anybody doing this
who's really ever offended i don't know
if i've ever been
offended i can't think of an example
have i ever said i've ever been offended
by anything
is that if i ever use that word in
talking about myself
i may have just like end of hyperbole
but not really
i'm sure i did
oh on this podcast
did i say it on this podcast
that would be funny if i did
that would be funny
all right um
yeah maybe somebody is using
hyperbole sometimes
all right that's all i have for today
and
i'm going to
talk to you tomorrow
