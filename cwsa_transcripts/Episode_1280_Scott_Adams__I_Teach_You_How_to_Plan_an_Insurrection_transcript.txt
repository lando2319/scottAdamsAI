hey everybody i'm coming to you from my
man cave in northern california
in an otherwise undisclosed location
now if you're like me and you've been
watching the news and you've been
watching our
congress in action you might be saying
to yourself
yourself something like this i think we
need some kind of a
insurrection or a coup
let's call them the same thing and
you're thinking to yourself
how can i mount an insurrection or
mount a coup against the government of
the united states and you're thinking to
yourself that's a pretty big job
it's a big job and you're going to need
to be prepared
so i'm going to teach you what you need
to have
ready for when you plan your coup
or your insurrection now the first thing
you're going to be worried about
is who you're going against in this case
you'd be going against the entire
military of the united states
so that's pretty big right the entire
military of the united states
the greatest fighting force ever
assembled in the history of
uh civilization so that's that's a
pretty big
you know mountain to climb but if you
went at that
unprepared what are your odds really
let's say you just said i'm going to
throw an insurrection
i'm not going to be prepared how's that
going to go
against a nuclear arsenal
not well i mean i think they're going to
win almost every time
but let's say you were prepared and i'm
going to teach you
how if you're prepared a little bit
goes a long way and let me tell you how
to get ready for an insurrection the
first thing you need
and this is something we've learned
recently is a handful of these
twist ties well actually they're plastic
ties
i don't use the twist ties they will not
work in an insurrection
but the plastic ones especially the
white ones
you get a good handful of these and
you're ready to take over
a major military power i mean what are
they going to do when they see these
they might fight if they're foolish but
i think a lot of them would just
give up their weapons and turn and run
once they saw you had these
now here's the thing it's not necessary
for
every person in the insurrection to come
equipped like this i mean that would be
impractical you wouldn't expect
everyone to come prepared right no you
can never get that
with any crowd but you really need just
one guy
or it could could be a woman a woman or
a man or
or whatever you would like to label
yourself you just need one of them
and one handful of these these are
plastic ties so make sure you get the
right kind
these are a little small this
this one is just about right for
overthrowing a major military power
look at the length you've got to get get
at least this length
here would be a mistake a lot of people
who show up with a coup
and they'll have these small ones what
are you going to do with this
why are you going to are you going to
tie up somebody's
finger this is stupid
there's no way you're going to have a
successful insurrection
if you bring the wrong kind of plastic
ties
that's not going to work all right now
that's not the only thing you need
because that would be dumb right how are
you going to overthrow a major military
with
one person bringing one handful of
plastic ties
and that's not all you need right so
we're not done yet
there's something else very important
and if you
if you don't do this part what kind of a
coup are you going to have
not much really and that part is you
need at least
one member and it could be you don't
don't wait for someone else to do this
you got to step
up if you're running an insurrection or
a coup
and this is the important part you got
to bring at least
one funny hat now
i've heard it said that you need a
viking hat
for a proper insurrection but i don't
know if you do
i feel as if it has more to do with the
theatrical effect so i'm pretty sure
that any funny hat is going to get you
the same
insurrection coup protection as any
other
so don't don't waste your time looking
for a viking hat
with fur some people say it's a buffalo
hat
let's not get into that conversation i'm
just telling you that if you go to a
coup
or an insurrection that's been incited
by
orange band bad for example that's just
an example
if you come with the wrong uh headwear
good luck good luck with your coup
that's not going to go very far
is it so reviewing for those just
joining
if you're going to stage a proper coup
and
really have any chance of gaining and
holding
power against a major military force
really the biggest most powerful
fighting force that the universe has
ever seen
could need a handful of
these plastic ties not everyone just one
guy
just bring a handful and you need at
least
one person with an imaginative hat
because when somebody's trying to find
the leader
you know if you have these these big you
know
coup insurrection type situations
there's a lot of chaos
you'd expect that you know there's a lot
of fog of war and chaos
and so who how are you going to know who
to follow
would you just listen i hear somebody
shouting coup instructions but would you
even know that that was the leader i
mean it could be a false flag it could
be
it could be somebody else just yelling
things and then you start doing it and
then your coup is all disorganized so
that's not going to work
what you need is for ideally
the leader to come with the appropriate
headwear
because then you're looking around
you're like who's in charge who's in
charge you see somebody with a viking
hat
or possibly could be a bison
inspired hat but we don't want to get
into that controversy today
but either one you immediately say
ah there's the leader
and that's somebody who could take over
some property and hold it now
the other thing is you're thinking how
are we going to destroy
all these tanks and guns and nuclear
weapons and
and aircraft probably the navy too we'd
have to destroy that too
to really hold the country because a lot
of the american military they're
well they're feisty you know they
they've got this reputation to uphold or
they're all macho
and if you if you try to beat them in a
military conflict
and let's just say you know they come at
you hard but you're just kicking their
asses with these
plastic ties and they're taking heavy
losses
do you think they're going to give up no
the american military
they're plucky you could be kicking
their asses
with these plastic ties and your funny
hats and all they would have is their
nuclear weapons and stuff like that
which would be largely useless against
this kind of a weapon
but they don't give up right the
military
those are these are trained fighters
it's the best of the best
you know we only recruit i mean it's a
voluntary army so we can be picky
we only get the best they're not gonna
they're not gonna run
from the fight so you're gonna have to
finish them off
and that's gonna take a while right
because there are a lot of them and
they're gonna keep fighting
you know all that so
make sure that you come with the right
attitude if you're going to start the
coup or the insurrection make sure you
finish it
now here's a way that you can get on top
of the biggest military in the world
you take over an empty room in the
capitol
and you hold that room for 45 minutes
there you go there's a coup
because a lot of citizens
i think in the latest rasmussen polls
68.3
percent of all citizens said they would
take
orders from anyone who could
hold a room in the capitol for up to 45
minutes
and a lot of people would say well i
used to be an american
i like the old system with voting and
stuff like that but
now that i see this buffalo hat guy
or it could have been a viking hat again
we don't want to get into that
once i see him giving orders from that
otherwise empty room
in the capitol building i realized that
my loyalty
had been in the wrong place the whole
time so that's
i mean that's how that's how it could
happen they could get the loyalty to the
public
simply by uh taking over an empty room
in the capitol building
uh they could conquer the military of
the united states who would be good
fighters
i mean nothing against our military our
military
is pretty tough but they'd be coming up
against this
i think you know you would understand if
they lost
a fight against this kind of power
so that's what you need to be prepared
for your next
insurrection or coup and the other thing
that
this is maybe the most important thing i
hope you stayed for this
you don't want to just decide
to go on a coup that would be like a
suicide mission you don't want that
no you want to be incited because if
you're getting incited
other people are getting incited and
then you get
excited and then you go do your your
coup
but you don't want to do any kind of a
coup unless
somebody who isn't you incites you
because you probably thought you had
free will
uh that's an illusion you don't you are
simply
something getting incited by other
people
so in a way you're not even responsible
for your own actions
because you got incited and
you know what can you do when i get when
i feel i'm getting incited
to do something i just stop thinking
because
what what am i going to add to that
nothing
right i got my facts and my logic and my
self-preservation but those are not
important
compared to being incited by somebody
else's opinion that
you should go do something that might be
good for the person who incited it
but is going to land you in jail
so when i i'm presented with that
situation hey
wait you mean i could do something for
you
and you would be perfectly safe but but
i might go to jail
while i'm doing something for for you
i like that i like that and so
you know you could understand somebody
under that condition would say
yeah yeah i wasn't going to
try to overthrow the government of the
united states but
now that i've been incited what am i
going to do
what am i going to do i better start
attacking right now
so this was just a little bit of a
lesson to get you going a lot of people
don't know how to throw a
proper insurrection and if you don't get
it right
you would never have a change of
government as we're experiencing now
now you know that right
oh oh wow i'm seeing in the comments a
lot of people
think that the the insurrection failed
are you kidding no the insurrection
succeeded
yeah no the insurrection succeeded
because
if we had had it failed
you would have seen an efficient biden
government coming in
doing things to bring the country
together and you'd have
unity and stuff like that you know
you don't see anything like that so i
assume
the coup succeeded i mean why wouldn't
it
they had plastic ties and hats
so um that plus selfies is all you need
for a proper
uh coup and that is your lesson for
today
