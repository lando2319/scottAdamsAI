hey
olga come on in here
the rest of you two come on in ricky
john gather around get your cup get your
mugs of coffee because you know what
time it is
i think you do it's almost time
for the simultaneous sip it's time for
coffee with scott adams grab your mug
your stein your your container your cup
and lift it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee
and join me for the simultaneous sip
well let me start off today's periscope
the same way
i'm likely to
end it which is by saying
nobody condones violence and by saying
there's nothing funny about somebody
sending bombs to public figures
especially because i'm a public figure i
don't like
any any anything happening to public
figures you can
see obviously why that said
life does go on and there are some very
interesting
dare i say humorous elements of the
story
but violence is not funny
with one exception which i'll talk about
in a minute
so where to start with this so let's
let's go uh uh fbi profiler
okay so let's play fbi profiler
and we're gonna try to figure out um
who the perpetrator is
now some people have said hey it's a
false flag and it's probably some kind
of
some kind of democrat pretending to be a
republican because the midterms are
coming
to which i say possible
possible but
i'm not going that way i'm still saying
it's somebody on the right somebody who
is a trump supporter specifically
but may not be mentally all there
or certainly is mentally not all there
now there's
something that has been missed it seems
to me
and you might not see this on television
so what i'm going to tell you you may
never see in the regular media
because there's something they can't say
ready for it there's something about
this list
of the people who got the fake bombs and
today we heard that uh
possibly robert de niro and also
joe biden may have gotten bomb packages
that also did not go off
what is it about this particular group
of democrats because i saw that de
niro's spokesperson said
well it's obvious that there's that
these people have something in common
but did we get the right thing that they
have in common
let me let me uh describe the people
who got the bombs but i'm going to
describe them
the way the press has described them
now when i talk about the press in this
case i'm talking about both the left and
the right
so so what so what will i'm going to
present is not my opinion
this is not my opinion coming up this is
a description of the people who receive
these bombs
according to the press the press is the
press on the right
and the press on the left so sometimes
i'll be picking from the right
sometimes from the left but here here's
uh
you've got two people who have said in
public they want to punch the president
uh that's de niro and biden you've got
um
at least one accused serial rapist
that's uh bill clinton you've got one
person who
uh painted half of the country as
nazis if you pay half the country as
nazis you're really
sort of marking them for violence that
was hillary clinton
we've got one person on the list who's
accused of being a nazi collaborator
collaborator i believe that's not
accurate
but if you're reading various types of
press
you know not the not the top level press
but the
the lower level less dependable press
on the right will tell you that george
soros was a nazi collaborator when he
was 14 years old
which i consider uh ridiculous
that's my opinion but the press has
branded these people the way i'm the way
i'm describing
there's one person on the left list who
elected who
who allegedly tried to rig an election
and succeeded there's somebody on the
list who tried to rig
the united states election and succeeded
uh debbie wasserman
there's somebody on the list who's a
deep deep state traitor
and the list and the leader of them
again
not my opinion i'm giving you the
characterizations that you would have
seen in the press
either the left or the right so one of
them is the head
you know the head traitor of the deep
state i'm not saying this in my opinion
i'm saying that's how the press has
portrayed john brennan
there's one person on the list who said
you should kick
kick republicans when they're down
a call to violence there's one person on
the list who said you should harass
republicans wherever you find them
maxine waters
and there's obama who's on the list um
you could make a case that he has or has
not done anything
that would put him on this list i would
say not so much but he's sort of
the head symbol of the the other side
so here's here's what's interesting um
here's what's the think about the people
who are not on the list
there are a lot of people who are not on
the list for example
where is nancy pelosi on this list
nancy pelosi is not on the list chuck
schumer
is not on the list let me tell you why
nancy pelosi
and chuck schumer were not on the
bombers list
because those two people you might not
like their politics
but they are not freaking
okay again i'm not i'm not defending a
bomber
that's not what's happening here i'm
saying that if we're trying to profile
the bomber
and try to figure out why would he
target this group as opposed to any
other group
he has left off two of the biggest
democrats
he left off bernie he left off pelosi he
left off schumer
what do those three people have in
common
to their credit to their credit
pelosi schumer and bernie
have never advocated violence of any
kind
against republicans
nancy pelosi chuck schumer and bernie
sanders have never used words
that demonized the entire republican
party
as in deplorable as in
racist um well they've probably played
with the racist term
but that's sort of routine politics in
their case
those three people are not on the list
the people who are on the list
are people who specifically allegedly
according to the media not according to
me according to the media either the
left or the right
have been promoting violence against the
right
or they've been involved in something
that looks like literally
an overthrow of the government
so i would say and let me say this every
10 seconds
it's not my opinion i'm i'm giving you
the
characterization that someone would have
if they watch the media
not watching me but watching the media
so i'm gonna say definitely um
republican and here's the reason it's
not a false flag
if it were a false flag some of the
people on the list
would be the kind that had not called
for
uh an overthrow of the government who
had not been
nazis or racists had not been accusing
people of racists i mean
had not been um offering
offering up the idea of violence against
republicans
if it had been a uh a black
what would no no what would you call it
a uh a false flag
if it had been a false flag they would
have picked even accidentally
they would have picked some people who
didn't belong on the list they would
have picked pelosi
they would have picked schumer maybe
bernie
they would have picked cory booker has
cory booker called for any violence
against republicans i don't think so
all right it's not an accident why this
group is on the list
to me this has every look of a
republican
who has been pulled in by the media
in other words the media has created a
narrative
about all these people which in some
cases is deserved i'm not saying it's
not deserved but it's clear to me that
it's a republican
so i'm guessing republican now i said
there's nothing funny about
attempted violence but you be the judge
i tweeted this yesterday and it got over
6 000
retweets which is a big number for me
and 20
000 likes and i said about the topic i
said my first thought
was that the bombs came from a
republican
then i learned the bombs don't work
use your own judgment about whether
that's funny or insightful
but
that's just a joke it looks like the
bombs were either made by somebody who's
not
completely in their mental capacity
or somebody who didn't intend them to go
off
so that's that's possible
but uh my official uh my official
prediction is
a republican who has been activated by
the press in this case more by the press
the right leaning press than the left
leaning press
but certainly both
now what's interesting here is watching
the the press try to make a case
so right now the press is trying to make
sure that the president gets most of the
blame
because the alternative to that is the
press itself
so the press is in full out it's not us
it's not
us especially the cnn side of the world
now let me give you my take on this
here here are some of the things that
people are in the press
are showing as equivalents they will say
for example
well sure that there was that person on
the left who took a gun
to the baseball game and shot up steve
scalise
and other folks and yeah that's an
example of something that happened on
the left
but it's not just the left they would
say
look at that guy who brought a gun to
the pizza parlor
because he believed that there was that
there might have been children somehow
in the basement of the pizza parlor
based on a conspiracy theory that they
were being sexually abused
are those equivalents there's something
different about those two situations
one is somebody who went to a baseball
game to kill people
the other is somebody who went to a
pizza parlor to save
children now he was wrong
there were no children there but
but did that guy go to the pizza parlor
to kill people there's no evidence of
that
he had a weapon because you would need a
weapon to do whatever he was going to do
but he was unfortunately had been
hoaxed by the media and by social media
more social media than the media so i'll
say social media
and it's not exactly the same thing so
when we compare those two
keep in mind that one was trying to save
children and the other was trying to
kill adults
not exactly equivalent um
but let's let's look at the things that
are equivalent i'm seeing in the media
and i saw it this morning on cnn
that since 9 11 this is the number of
people who have died in
what you would call terrorist attacks at
the united states
there have been 73 right-wing victims
or seven sorry 73 right-wing attacks
in other words have been 72 classified
terrorist domestic attacks by people who
would be
associated with the political right
cnn reports that there were 140 104
jihadist attacks but we're not talking
about that today so let's just look at
73
right wing attacks and then they said
there were only eight
um or eight deaths or was it 70 no 73
people died from right-wing attacks
that's what it is
it's not the number of attacks it's how
many died 73 people died from right-wing
attacks eight people died from
some kind of black activist um
shooting and they left out
how many left-leaning deaths there were
in other words cnn reported on the
number of people who were killed
by political affiliation and they left
out liberals
like the whole category isn't there the
whole freaking category isn't there
they just left it out these are the
categories that they reported
right wing attacks things specifically
related to
african americans and then jihadists
where's where's the guy who attacked the
baseball field
where's the guy who shot i guess because
nobody died
so it doesn't have to be on the list is
that right
so i saw this other list too where there
were all these people killed by right
wings and
let me ask you this i watched the news
do you remember that in the last
dozens of years whatever is it your
recollection
that there have been lots of right wing
terrorist attacks that killed people
why don't i remember them and how come
every time they're reported
either on cnn or they're reported on
social media there are lots of
graphs you're seeing nobody nobody
points to the detail
why is it that i don't remember any of
these
almost any of them i remember a couple
of the big ones but
um las vegas was not a political
act so that wouldn't even be in the list
or it shouldn't be
so are we being duped again
because when they say the news is
consistently reporting at least the
you know that the left-leaning news is
consistently reporting
that right-wingers have killed far far
more people
not even close far more people in the
united states
in in what would be classified terror
attacks do you remember those
have you seen the list to them now las
vegas would not be in the list
because that motive is unknown and
didn't seem to be politics
so yeah there's something wrong here
right
they're making a claim that's a really
radical claim
but they never point to the detail
there's a reason for that
there's something about the detail that
doesn't work
if they if the details worked in other
words if pointing to the details and
saying
all these right wings attack attacks
happened here's the list
look at this long list if the details
were persuasive
they would point to the details every
time they talked about it
um so
that's a big problem in my opinion
now i'm watching cnn say that they the
responsibility is with the president
let's let's talk about
that uh let me let me start by saying
that it is probably true that anybody
who
amps up the emotion in politics
has has a risk of activating the crazier
parts of society
there's very low risk that the average
person is going to pick up a weapon
but you know it's a big country you only
need one bomber
to um you know completely dominate our
attention
so out of 300 whatever million americans
what are the chances that let's say
provocative political speech
would cause somebody to pick up a weapon
i will tell you the odds of that
it's a hundred percent it wouldn't
matter who the politician was
wouldn't matter if we're talking about
the news doing something that was
provocative
it wouldn't matter if we're talking
about a democrat it wouldn't matter if
we're talking about a republican
if you elevate you know the temperature
of political speech you've got 300
million people
some of them have guns some of them have
time
some of them are crazy someone's going
to pick up a gun
now is that a reason to not do it
some would say yes but the trouble is
the free speech has this problem in
all kinds of topics there are all kinds
of topics
where if you simply talk about something
in a in a public way
there are so many people in the country
there's somebody who's gonna go kill
themselves
or kill you i've also made the
the argument that i when i was a kid i
used to
laugh when when people would say that
the music or the
you know and now you'd say the video
games but when people say that they
would
cause somebody to go murder or kill
themselves or something like that
and i would say nobody's gonna kill
themselves over a song
nobody's gonna go murder somebody
because of
music but then i grew up and i learned
about persuasion
and i learned how different people are
and i learned about how deep the mental
health problem is in america
and now i take it as a matter of fact
with no doubt whatsoever
what i'm going to say there is no no
hesitation
no doubt not the slightest chance i'm
wrong
if you have 300 plus million people and
you send them provocative messages on
any topic
some of them are going to do some deeply
bad stuff you don't want to happen
that is what free speech looks like
so if you don't want that stuff to
happen you have to get rid of free
speech
because that's the only the only way
you're going to get rid of it is to get
rid of free speech
and we're not going to do that that said
it still is fair to police our speech
let's talk about the president and
compare him to the media
and to the democrats the media and the
democrats
the anti-trumpers let's say have created
a picture of reality through consistent
reporting
that has been reinforced as recently as
yesterday by senator
harani who said
that when the president calls himself a
nationalist
that we should not give him the benefit
of a doubt
that he's just talking about her
national identity
but rather he's a racist
what is what happens when a sitting
senator
says without any hint of hyperbole
that the president of the united states
is a racist
what does that do to the political
temperature
well the first thing it does is if
you're
a man or
or you're on the right you're
conservative if you don't vote this year
you're freaking crazy because
this is the sort of thing you need a lot
less of all right
harani has actually she's insulted men
and she's insulted
uh essentially all republicans and all
conservatives
because pretty much all of them would
consider nationalist a compliment not an
insult
or at least it would be a they would
consider nationalists and just a
objective description of somebody who
follows the constitution basically
and so compare that
now compare from the from the
election on that hillary and her team
have been painting
republicans and me i'm going to put
myself in this category
because as a a labeled trump supporter
people have been calling me a nazi um
and uh joseph gobbles
since the election
am i less safe because of what
because of what democrats and what the
press
has said about republicans and therefore
has extended to me
i'm not republican but they've extended
it to me
am i less safe in this country
absolutely
am i a danger of being killed because
of the environment that the press
and the democrats working together have
created
absolutely i am absolutely
at greater danger uh in this world
because of cnn
so cnn has to own that cnn has made me
less
less safe now of course the other side
would say
but you're all a bunch of racists so
you've made us less safe by
electing trump etc so that's that's
their movie that they're seeing in their
head
but it the movie in my head is the one
that gets people killed
right the movie that other people are
seeing in their head is not
materializing
because there are no concentration camps
you know that it's just not
materializing
but the one in my head the one where the
the press has made it a dangerous place
to live
did cause somebody to take a a weapon to
a baseball game and start shooting
republicans
that happened that was real
so now let's compare that
to the president's rhetoric and there's
a filter i'm going to put on this that
you've never seen before
that's why you watch my periscopes
here's the filter you've never seen
before
humor changes over the decades
nobody said this to you before i've said
it in different contexts
but it's important here the thing that
looks like a joke
the thing that looks like humor is
different in the 40s
than it was in the 50s than it was in
the 60s about every 10 years or so
what we consider the you know the best
form of humor the popular form of humor
changes this is an important concept for
what comes next
in the when i was a kid
humor was very slapstick when i was a
kid
the three stooges were a huge phenomenon
i was never a fan
i i never cared for the three stooges
but their entire
their entire act was getting slapped on
the head and somebody poked in the eyes
and
and hit by a board and it was all
physical
violence humor now from
viewed from a lens of 2018 you say to
yourself
my god whoever thought that was funny
but that's not the point the point is
that it used to be
generally considered what humor looked
like
and now it's generally considered
inappropriate
last night christine and i uh watched
a movie that i think was made in the 90s
called
there's something about mary it's a
humorous
movie with uh uh
well you don't need to know more than
that it's a humorous movie and we
watched it and there was there was very
little in that movie
that you could put in a movie today uh
at least a third of the movie
probably a third of the humor in the
movie involved
um laughing at people with physical or
mental disabilities can you even
freaking imagine that
like i remember watching it at the time
when it was a new movie
and laughing uproariously and i don't
remember being offended by anything
but even i who is not offended by
anything
i watched that movie through a lens of
2018
and it was cringe-worthy you should you
should go back and watch it
it is cringe-worthy because of making
fun of people who had
physical and mental disabilities and i i
it was really hard to watch
so that's how much humor has changed in
those few decades now here's how this
matters
i and others have been saying that when
the president
says his provocative things at um
rallies
that is humor and other people are
saying that's not humor
when you say when you say i'll pay for
the doctor's bills you know knock the
heck out of him
if you when you say stuff like that
that's not funny
here's what's missing trump supporters
tend to skew
older and rural
the people who are against trump tend to
be
younger more female
that matters here too more female
younger
and urban those two groups have
different
senses of humor trump comes from an era
in which if you said i'm gonna kick your
ass i'm gonna i'm gonna beat you up
that it's often said with an
understanding that that's not real
it's just a way of talking it's sort of
a humorous
kind of normal way to express things why
do i say that it is normal for somebody
of trump's age
to talk about beating people up and just
saying well we're just joking
look at joe biden what did joe biden say
in public the same age right
so joe biden same age
he said that he would take trump behind
the bleachers if he were in school with
him
and beat him up now what was the
reaction
when biden said that i don't remember
but i'm pretty sure it was laughter
so in other words people didn't think
that biden meant
literally to take him take him and punch
him
biden is of a certain age trump is of a
certain age
i'm of a certain age i'm younger than
them but i'm old enough to know
that i can't tell you the number of
times
that somebody has corrected me over
let's say the last
10 or 20 years because i've said
something i thought was funny
that other people thought was too
violent
and it's a generational thing slapstick
humor
where somebody gets hurt but you know
they don't get killed
is a characteristic of an old type of
humor
that people of a certain age and
especially males
all right the three stooges was largely
a male
humor property if you're a certain age
and you're male
and you say you're gonna kick somebody's
ass you probably don't mean it seriously
and you also think that other people
understand it
as not being serious that's the problem
when when trump is in his rally mode
i think the part we can all agree on is
that he's trying to be entertaining
he's trying to be funny and based on the
laughter and the reaction
and the size of the crowds he is
succeeding
really well right in terms of making an
audience laugh
and be engaged and you know
just be on the same page with him he's
really really really good at it
and historians will agree for sure
i believe that everyone in the trump
rally with the exception i think of one
old guy who got confused and actually
tried to hurt somebody once
early on in the in the campaign but
lately
lately there's been essentially zero
i think zero um altercations at trump
rallies
wouldn't you say that people who go to
trump rallies understand that when he
talks like that
it's for the effect it's part of the act
it's part of the humor
it's just that not everybody sees
slapstick humor
as funny if you're young
female and urban
probably that's not your style of humor
and to you it just looks like hey wait a
minute
that sounds like a little bit of
violence
let me give you another example how old
is
eric holder eric holder
looks like he's somewhere around my age
60s i'm not sure eric holder said that
when the
when the republicans are down wait was
it holder
yeah uh you should kick him
who says something like that when the
republicans are down you should kick him
well somebody who's male and a certain
age
it's just the way people who are male in
a certain age talk
now i don't know where holder grew up if
he was urban or
rural but
um i've got a feeling that that was just
a normal way to talk
when he grew up he just extended it to
2018 and it didn't play
same as trump does on a fairly regular
basis
so now let's compare these two things
you've got a president trump
who makes frequent references to
slapstick humor
in my opinion he should call it back
this is the time to call it back all
right
i think it did its job of getting people
fired up and interested
i think it went a little too far if if
ever he was going to call something back
this would be a good time to do it but i
would call it
i would label it slapstick humor and i
would admit
that you know it maybe it was a good
time to call it back you don't even have
to apologize you could just say
going forward you know i'm going to dial
it back a little
so it's dangerous to um i'm not
recommending that the president takes
responsibility
for any violence because that's not how
freedom of speech works
free speech allows you to say what you
want to say
and if people do what you didn't want
them to do that
that doesn't make that your
responsibility there can be a cause and
effect there hold on
so that so the cause and effect might be
real
but we don't assign responsibility
because freedom of speech doesn't work
that way
one person can talk and another person
can act and you don't blame the talker
for the actor
so trump has employed humor
that i believe has been misinterpreted
by
many if you see it as a generational
thing
as a male form of humor that was
appropriate in his life
was support was also appropriate in joe
biden's experience
i'm guessing was also appropriate in
eric holder's opinion because they but
they'll talk the same way
you know so that's the way you should
see it but i do think it can be
misinterpreted
and i think that the president would be
advised
to not take responsibility for what has
happened
but to perhaps say that he'll dial it
back in the future
that would be the right way to play it
in my opinion but none of us should give
advice to the president because
uh he's the president and we're not i'm
always a little bit humble
about maybe it's the only time i'm
humble
i'm always humble about giving advice to
people who are more successful than i am
because obviously whatever they're doing
whatever they're doing is working
now let's look at the press the press
get rid of this guy who says i'm an
apologist you're so 2015.
um now let's look at the press
the press has legitimately tried to
paint trump supporters as racists
and nazis so the the left-leaning press
along with
uh the democrats what is more dangerous
old guys making slapstick jokes
or an entire media
oligarchy painting a huge segment of
society
as worthy of death which is what nazis
and racists
are in the minds of most americans
they're horrible people who
deserve whatever that comes to them
i don't think you can compare those two
i don't see any way
that you can say that uh an an old guy's
slapstick humor that didn't didn't
that wasn't received the way he hoped it
would be received by everybody
how do you compare that to literally
branding people as nazis including me
i don't even go out in public anymore i
literally won't
won't do public events if there are big
crowds there because of the security
concerns
is that security problem caused by
president trump
doesn't feel like it to me to me it
feels like it was caused by the
anti-trump media
because they're the ones who have
convinced the base that there's an
actual racist hitler thing happening
here
so i would say that people like harani
senator harani from hawaii who says that
being a nationalist is the same as being
a racist in her mind
at least when president trump uses uses
the word and therefore
extends to his base by association
i would say she is one of the worst
people
i've ever seen like just a
horrible horrible person as a human
being
she is despicable and i have to say
that i know i almost never have this
reaction to just
famous people i disagree with but
i've never had such a bad reaction to
anybody
as i have to senator harani do you
do any of you have that same reaction
and i can't tell what the hell it is
it's not because she's a woman it's not
because i disagree with her
i don't know what it is it's something
about the way she says it
that literally just sounds evil
like it doesn't seem it doesn't seem
like there's
anything productive even intended by it
it just feels evil to me and i can't
believe that she's an elected official
if there's one person who should be
removed from office legally
legally nobody wants violence
let me say that again but if there's
somebody who should be legally
removed from office it should be
somebody who incites that kind of
violence
all right so watching cnn
desperately try to avoid responsibility
for what
clearly is the presses and and by the
way i'm not i'm not letting fox news off
the hook here
so the the right leaning press
is almost certainly who has activated
this particular guy that's my opinion
all right so my opinion is somebody who
watches
watches the press on the right sort of a
fox news
type person uh and probably consumes
other
right-leaning uh media
now i don't think just to be clear
if the only thing you watched was fox
news i don't think you send bombs to
people
all right i don't think fox news
weaponizes people
at that level but if you're watching fox
news you're probably also consuming
things that are a little less credible
and i can see that as weaponizing you
all right um
what do we make of the fact that none of
the bombs worked
or none of the and
and i'm kind of expecting to hear that
none of them
could have worked
here's what we haven't heard about the
bombs
correct me if i'm wrong we have not
heard that there's any electronics
with the bombs have we has there been
any reporting
that the bombs have any kind of a remote
detonating device if we don't hear that
and i don't think we will because
whoever this bomber was
couldn't spell didn't have the right
addresses
did not seem to be a master bomb maker
to me
but the odds that that person could have
a remote
detonator you know given the low level
of
of skill that was involved
it does not sound like a master bomb
maker
so i'm guessing that there was no
detonating device
it was obviously it was not based on
motion
if there were no electronics it's not
based on time
and it would not be based on and i think
they would probably not based on time
because you wouldn't know
exactly when the right person has the
package um
and this is someone who is targeting
specific people this is someone who is
not trying to
kill the security guard this is somebody
who did not want to kill
the postal worker who delivered the
package or or the courier or whoever
delivered it so this is somebody who was
after specific people
so that means they would either have
some way to detonate it
and that seems to be missing yeah there
seems to be no clock
there seems to be no remote detonation
which leads me to believe
that it's a right wing white adult male
who is republican leaning who was
activated by the press
you know he was weaponized by the press
he is not a very good
bomb maker he does not have an advanced
education
high school education tops and maybe not
even that
and that is not a good bomb maker
all right
so there were wires but they were over
gauged somebody says
which would be yeah a sign of a
a fake somebody says false they had
electronics
so if they have electronics
and if those electronics are real
meaning that
the electronics are actually hooked to
the bomb in a way that they could have
detonated them
then i will say
yes somebody just said that none of them
were disposed of
by destruction what does it mean
that none of the bombs were blown up on
site
just to limit their destruction
i think it tells you that people who
understand bombs
looked at them and by sight they could
tell they were not
functional bombs probably
so somebody says there were clocks
but were they connected and were they
connected in a way that would actually
activate it
there's a big lcd clock on every one of
them somebody says
let's find out something tells me that
the clock
as a mechanism for what can you think of
anything that would be
less effective than a clock
all right keep in mind let's think about
this
keep in mind that these are not bombs
that are placed in the building
and then you go away and you wait for
the the clock to take down then they
blow up
these were things that were going to
change hands these
these packages and we're going to be in
different places at different times
there are two possibilities the bomb
blows up before it reaches its target
or the target opens the package
sees it's a bomb looks at the time on it
and says
oh i've got five minutes left and
then they leave the room
if you are going to try to send a
package bomb
to somebody a mail bomb you don't put a
timer on it
so if what you saw was a clock on these
bombs
you saw somebody who was not really a
bomb maker or really didn't want them to
go off
you would never use a timer on a mail
bomb
am i wrong am i wrong that you would
never use a timer
on a mailbom because you needed to be in
the in the
target's hands um at the very time
somebody says soros's
version was exploded so there's a lot of
fog of war here
so let me not let me not give you fake
news i don't know
that none of them were exploded maybe
thesaurus was one
one was maybe some other ones were but
that may also have to do with different
law enforcement handling it in different
ways
all right an lcd clock would be
ridiculous
right bad design so that's what we know
for now
so you have my prediction it's an adult
white uh republican-leaning
guy who doesn't know how to make a bomb
or
didn't mean them to go off they could
have been intentionally fake
he could have been making a point
but we'll see
um all right that's all i have for now
and i will talk to all of you tomorrow
