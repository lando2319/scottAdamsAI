bum
bum bum bum hey everybody come on in
here
it's time for coffee with Scott Adams
boom that's why you wake up in the
morning you might have other reasons too
but I like to think the main reason is
this
and if you're ready for the morning sip
it doesn't take much no it doesn't you
don't have to be terribly prepared but
you have to be a little bit prepared
you're gonna need a minimum a copper mug
or a glass of Stein the Chalice Tankard
of thermos of flask a canteen or a
vessel of some kind
to put some liquid in it could be coffee
could be something else I like coffee
but if you'd like to have that dopamine
hit that gets your day off to a great
start
[Music]
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the simultaneous sip go
um
good stuff
yes it is less than 100 days until my
buck loser think hits the market you
could pre-order it now
find out what's going on in this crazy
world understand it for the first time
ever
all right
um the big news today is that Jeffrey
Epstein is still dead
how long do you think we're going to be
talking about this a while but while
it's still fun
now usually
I do not find pleasure in anybody's
death
Osama Bin Laden was an exception Jeffrey
Epstein is another exception given that
a hundred percent of the people in the
world including Jeffrey Epstein wanted
him dead
I can't generate any empathy whatsoever
let's talk about a few things
um yesterday
I was saying that Trump critics
who are calling all Trump supporters
white supremacists or white supremacist
enablers which is the same thing
that they're despicable and I I call
them to Donnie Deutsch in particular
who has of late been saying that Trump
is clearly a white supremacist and
anybody who votes for him has that same
stain on them so you know don't pretend
you're not a white supremacist if you
voted for Trump now I likened Donny
Deutsch's approach to creating a race
war and driving the country apart
based on largely believing in the
Charlottesville hoax which is the alpha
hoax which makes you believe all the
other stuff was true too and that's
confirmation bias
so I was likening what Deutsche was
doing on a moral plane
to Jeffrey Epstein
well it turns out that I know somebody
who knows Donnie deutschen
he's not he did not appreciate being
compared to Jeffrey Epstein it turns out
now you know what I don't appreciate
being compared to
um white supremacists
I don't I don't appreciate that do any
of you appreciate
the Donnie Deutsch goes on television
and tries to set you up to be murdered
let's call it what it is Donnie Deutsch
when he calls you white supremacist is
making it dangerous for you to go
outside if you're identified as a trump
supporter so from a moral perspective
is putting a Target on 60 million
people's backs
for liking Trump for whatever reason
usually taxes or Supreme Court picks or
whatever
um calling them white supremacists and
marking them for death because that's
what it does let's let's be honest
in the United States in 2019
if you label somebody explicitly as a
white supremacist
you're marking them for death
there's no other way to put that now
just the fact that people have been
beaten but haven't actually died yet
that I'm aware of maybe there's an
exception that doesn't mean that he's
not marking you for death
so when I say that from a moral
perspective what Donnie Deutsch is doing
is identical in Badness on the moral
scale because it's a they're both tens
they're both as bad as you can get you
just can't get worse than either of
those two things
um I think it's a fair comparison
Donnie Deutsch apparently
had some trouble with that comparison
that's the world to win if if you do
something that makes you look
just like
just like the worst person in the world
people are gonna interpret it that way
I believe that's Donnie Deutsch's Point
too except he his world view is based on
a hoax
so his gullibility had took him took him
down the
well he's still at the top of the
Charlottesville fine people a hoax
funnel he probably still thinks that the
president was uh calling the neo-nazis
fine people even though the record
clearly says the opposite
um
anyway let's go on let's talk about
everybody is theorizing about Epstein
and I know you want to hear my theory
because mine is the best one all right
now I tweeted yesterday
that uh later yesterday I said I like a
good conspiracy theory as much as anyone
which is true I really like my
conspiracy theories I don't believe them
most of the time but I like them I
certainly enjoy them on lots of
different levels and so do you that's
why they're so popular
so I thought I'd like a good conspiracy
theory as much as anyone but if the
other theory is simple incompetence
I go with the odds
now at the time I wrote this I didn't
yet know
if there would be a legitimate second
theory that there was some incompetence
involved and it wasn't wasn't what we
think it is but turns out there is now a
smart person with experience who has
exactly that theory
it is
oh then somebody reacted to me saying
that it might be just simple
incompetence and because this is Twitter
somebody interpreted my statement this
way somebody said what does Scott Adams
know about the clintons I don't think he
wants to become a member of the hashtag
Clinton's body count Club
no I didn't tweet that to save my life
thank you for asking I tweeted it
because
I'm the guy who wrote the Dilbert
cartoon still do for 30 years
if your job is writing the Dilbert
cartoon
uh for 30 years
what do you see first when you see a
large organization and something went
wrong
my job
for 30 years and then plus my corporate
experience before that which informed my
cartooning
if you were to tell me something went
wrong in a large organization be it IBM
or be it a prison system or the justice
system what is always the top
explanation
incompetence somewhere
now
given that in general
that's always going to be your go-to
explanation if you have one explanation
that that requires a clever conspiracy
and you know lots of steps and things
had to happen and it was smuggling and
cameras were turned off and rules were
violated and you know and we'll never
look into it if your second theory is
that
but your first theory is well looks like
it's like every other organization in
the world
which one of those is more likely I
don't want to ruin your fun
but one of those is more likely now I
want to be as clear as I can
because most of you live in this black
and white world where where you think
I'm saying it's definitely that I'm not
saying that I'm saying if you're going
to play the odds
it's probably 20 20 to 1.
that it's incompetence
but there's still a solid
five percent
that something you know suspicious
happened now there's something in
between
where there might have been somebody who
just
let's say turned around
or somebody who was a little late on the
rounds intentionally
so there's there's probably some kind of
Middle Ground where it wasn't
incompetence but it was a a willful
dereliction of Duty
to get something done you know so I'm
not sure if that's a big plot if let's
say the only person involved was the
prison guard what if it was just one
person it was a prison guard and it had
nothing to do with anything except that
he hates happens to hate pedophiles
so he looked the other way for a little
while
Maybe
so we got those possibilities let's see
what some smart people say about those
two possibilities incompetence versus
Master Plan and and clever plot
um
so here are the things we know based on
the latest reporting no foul play is
suspected in his death of federal
official told CNN
so a federal official
who I would assume this federal official
is not going to be exactly the same
person who's in on the plot unless it's
such a big plot that the very first
federal official you ask about it is in
on it what are the odds of that the one
person they got a quote from
is also in on the plot
Maybe
that's again that's not impossible but
it's unlikely
so this federal official who was talking
to CNN this is CNN's reporting
um
the bureau's release called it quote an
apparent suicide
what
how could it how could it be ambiguous
you you ask yourself how many ways can
it be ambiguous because didn't you think
he hung himself
wasn't that what you thought
now if he hung himself
would that be ambiguous I suppose so
because somebody else could have hung
him right it's possible
um
so the authorities believe Epstein
hanged himself
a law enforcement Source said
um and the medical examiner hasn't yet
determined his manner of death
okay
um I said it's not clear
so in July when he had his first event
that was maybe an attack and maybe a
suicide
his first attack apparently they decided
wasn't necessarily suicide
so if you're asking yourself how could a
person who had attempted suicide so
recently
not be on suicide watch because
apparently he wasn't the answer is they
determined he didn't try to kill himself
the first time
now here's the piece of evidence that I
have not seen introduced which I will
introduce it's sort of something you
already know but nobody's mentioned it
yet
Epstein is not like a regular prisoner
in lots of ways one of the ways he's not
like a regular prisoner is that he's
really smart and he's manipulative and
he's one of the best con men
of all time based on what he managed to
do based on the way he made his money
based on how many people he manipulated
to be part of his plan based on
everything we know about him he would be
one of the most successfully
manipulative people of all time
now if one of the most successfully
manipulative people in the world
was asked did you try to kill yourself
or did somebody else attack you
and he said I didn't do this to myself I
was attacked could he convince the jail
that that was true
better than probably anybody
I'll bet
he could convince a a Jail Authority
of something that a regular prisoner
could not we're talking about a world
Superstar of persuasion in in all the
bad ways
um against a Jailer who's seen a lot of
people lie but they've never seen
anything like this guy
somebody says now you're reaching hold
on
I'm just I'm just laying out the
evidence would you disagree with this
statement that he would be more able to
lie and manipulate than an average
prisoner would you accept that he would
be way above average in manipulative
lying ability
so that way
we just took that as the fact
would he be able to convince people that
he wasn't a risk
let me ask you this if I wanted to kill
myself
and you know I can be pretty convincing
and I wanted people to think I did not
want to kill myself how persuasive would
I be making the case that although it's
true there was this thing that looked
like a suicide it wasn't really I was
just attacked
how hard would it be to convince
authorities that I had no intention to
harm myself
pretty easy
pretty easy I can imagine that dumb
people can't do it I can imagine the
people who were distressed and and have
you know mental problems Etc I could
imagine that they'd be bad at convincing
people that they don't mean any harm to
themselves
but the most manipulative one of the
brightest people who's ever been in jail
could he
could he convince people that he didn't
mean to harm himself
yeah he could I know he could because I
could
I could absolutely convince my jailers
that I did not mean to hurt myself and
it wouldn't even be that hard
so
we don't know if that happened
I'm just saying most successful
persuasive manipulative con man of all
time
versus an ordinary prison
um Authority you know employees
he would be pretty pretty persuasive
all right here are some other things
that I haven't heard mentioned
how many pedophiles
do they put on suicide watch we all know
that pedophiles are at special risk for
suicide
how many of them as a percentage are put
on the suicide watch because
it's expensive
isn't it don't you think the suicide
watch is pretty expensive
because you've got your cameras extra
authorities have to use special
facilities
I would assume without knowing anything
about the system that there are probably
more people who need suicide watch
than there are facilities to provide it
don't you imagine that there are plenty
of pedophiles in that same prison
who are not being on suicide watch and
yet we all know pedophiles are at high
risk for suicide
so if he was considered for suicide
watch
and then talk them out of it it would
probably be business as usual does the
prison does the prison system have an
obligation to treat him fundamentally
differently than they would have treated
every other pedophile
I don't know how much of his outside you
know risk Etc they can consider once
he's in jail
once you're in jail aren't there a set
of rules that are the jail rules and
don't you use the jail rules on
everybody largely the same
I would think so
so if the jail rule is that you must
satisfy this certain set of you know
checklist in order to get the expensive
and rare facilities to be on suicide
watch if you don't check the boxes I'll
bet you don't get the suicide watch
and what would be one of the boxes to
check
does the person's express any interest
out loud
and suicide and what if Epstein has
never expressed it
what if the first time he was found
injured he said are you kidding I don't
want to kill myself I'm going to win
this case he might have been lying but
you can easily imagine him saying that
so
let's take that effect into
consideration that there's an economic
element to this There Are Rules probably
somebody says you're wrong
so for those new I'm blocking the person
who said the two words you're wrong
because even if they're joking my rule
for years has been if you say those two
words with nothing else given that
there's enough room to give an
explanation of what you think is wrong
if all you say is you're wrong
you get blocked
because I don't need people like you or
in my life if you have a reason I want
to hear it if you know if there's
something that I don't haven't
considered Etc I'm I'm all in on that
but talking in that way you're wrong
that's insta block
all right
um
let's talk about some more facts see if
we can sort this out
um
so there's a criminal defense and
constitutional lawyer based in Atlanta
Paige pate
and he's got an opinion because he's got
a lot of experience
in this coin this kind of
some people are testing me to see if
I'll block them for saying you're wrong
and I hope you're happy with your test
because you just got blocked so the uh
criminal defense lawyer says
and I quote
um but I don't think that means that the
prison guards or staff intentionally
look the other way while Epstein killed
himself
so the lawyer says in my practice so
he's talking from experience here in my
practice I have often been frustrated by
the
incompetence of certain Bop correctional
officers and management
so he's often been frustrated about
incompetence from the very people that
we're talking about
and remember I said if one of the
theories is incompetence
it just is automatically 20 to 1 most
likely it doesn't even matter what the
situation is it's just always the likely
one
um
while it is possible this is the lawyer
continuing while it is possible
something more nefarious was a play
that's the same thing I say it's
possible
he says I think it is much more likely
that Epstein's suicide was a result of
negligence and not some Grand conspiracy
um CNN has reached out for comment from
the facilities people now
so here's somebody with experience in
this very realm who says incompetent oh
yeah it's it's an incompetent
organization that is commonly producing
a lot of incompetence
so what is what is the chances what are
the chances given that this feels very
credible to me because what this lawyer
is saying is I have experience and I can
tell you that they're incompetent often
that that is a thing
so I think that's reliable information
because he's not making a specific claim
he's talking about his experience
overall I feel like we could trust that
if somebody says something differently
uh later if somebody says you know the
Bureau of Prisons hires the finest
employees you you would never guess that
but we have the best hiring and we hire
only the finest employees does that
sound like that would be true do you
think that the people who I hate to say
this but I'm going to
do you think that the people who go into
that profession and they say let me ask
you this
I'll put it in the starkest possible way
when somebody is considering all of
their career Alternatives and they
decide that their career move is to be
inside a prison all day with all of all
that that implies
does that tell you that that's a person
with good decision making
well sometimes yes they might be people
who you know maybe they're on a career
path toward being policemen or something
police officers I should say uh maybe
you know maybe uh there aren't many jobs
in their town maybe they're just doing
it for a little while until they do
something better in all those cases they
could be top level employees but they're
just passing through
but in general if you're looking at all
the career opportunities in the world
and you say to yourself you know I'd
kind of like the one where
I'm personally in prison
literally in prison
all my working day every day
I don't know does that tell you that
those are the most capable people in the
world maybe because like I said I'm not
going to make a broad statement about
all of them I'm sure that many of them
are highly capable but as a rule in
theory
you know I'll use the shoe salesman's
rule to make my point
I have a theory that most men who sell
women's shoes have a foot fetish
or at least a shoe fetish because
they're the ones who would be willing to
work for the least amount of pay so over
time you would expect that that
profession would attract a lot of people
with fun fetishes why wouldn't it I mean
it just makes sense that doesn't mean
every huge salesman has a foot fetish
but over time it should attract more
people who do than other professions
likewise pedophiles are attracted to you
know being little league coaches and
scouting leaders and stuff like that at
a greater level than you know other
professions would because why wouldn't
it
all right
so there's that but let me give you a
counter counted that
the counter comes from a convict who
would bet in those same facilities
so Fox News talk to a person anonymously
we don't know his name doesn't matter
but he's got a lot of experience in
being in the same prison so apparently
he's been in this prison more than once
all right so the first person who says I
think it's probably incompetence is a
highly trained lawyer with lots of
experience so his credibility is highly
trained large
this next guy is literally a convict
who not only thought that committing
crimes for a living was a good career
move compared to his Alternatives but
also got caught more than once
which one of these is smarter
is the Constitutional lawyer
smarter and more credible than the
convict
who couldn't even get away with his
crimes so the convict who couldn't even
get away with his crimes points out that
between the floor and the ceiling is
like eight or nine feet there's no way
for you to connect to anything so he's
talking about the ability to hang
yourself there's there's nothing to
connect to you have sheets but they're
paper level not strong enough so he was
200 pounds so it could never happen
this is good inside information when
you're on suicide watch oh here's the
problem
the convict is describing a situation in
which you're on suicide watch
Epstein wasn't
that's the problem that he wasn't on
suicide watch so everything that this
convict is reporting that says it would
be difficult or too impossible because
the convict says it's impossible if
you're in one of these suicide watch
facilities no way because there's just
too many people watching and and you
don't have any materials in in there
that could ever be used to kill yourself
um but let's say let's say that Epstein
was in some kind of a cell that maybe
was not monitored with cameras you know
maybe he wasn't watched all the time but
perhaps they put him in the cell was
that had been specially constructed to
have no good you know suicide materials
in it
here's the next question
if this convict
who was so dumb that he can't even
commit crimes without getting caught and
he's been in this facility multiple
times and keeps committing crimes and
getting caught so he goes back to that
facility
um if that guy couldn't figure out how
to use the materials in this room to
kill himself
does that tell you that Epstein by every
account extraordinarily smart one of the
smartest people who's ever been in that
prison doesn't mean that he couldn't
figure out how to do it
because if you think about it those
rooms are sort of like Escape rooms
you've seen the commercial Escape rooms
where they put you in a room I haven't
done it but I understand they put you in
a room with certain materials and then
you have to figure out the puzzle of how
the group of you get out of the room so
this jail cell was sort of like a an
escape room
they're required a certain level of IQ
to escape
just because this convict was well below
the IQ level that would allow him to
figure out how to use the materials in
this room to kill himself
does that tell you much about somebody
with Epstein's IQ
not that much because honestly I've got
a feeling that somebody with Epstein's
IQ would have a better shot at putting
those materials together in a productive
way to kill himself I mean didn't he
wear a clothes
are you telling me that the convicts
don't have clothes on or are the clothes
made out of tissue paper
because
uh somebody says if you pee on your
boxers you can hang yourself with them
okay well I'm not going to test that
but I'll I'll take your word for that
um that's a thought I wish I'd never had
in my entire life
all right so if he wasn't on suicide
watch he probably could have talked
people into the notion that he wasn't
worth their limited resources for that
we don't know if that's the case
um so
remember we're in the fog of War about
this whole situation
I guess attorney general Barr is having
Justice look into it he's even having
the the IG look into it and they're
pretty serious about finding out what
the f happened so I think all the right
people are going to look into it here's
what I expect and I want you to to
compare your predictions to mine
remember let me give you some context
for those of you who are new to this
periscope I I present a world view and a
filter on reality based on persuasion
and based on the limits of you know
human
um perception let's say and I try to
make predictions when it makes sense
and then I try to do it publicly so that
you can see if my filter predicts better
than whatever filter you were using
before
and and that's all I'm doing so I make
predictions I see how well they predict
so I'm going to predict counter to the
primary belief the primary belief I
think here is that there was something
sketchy that happened
my my filter says that a big
organization
is always incompetent and that this
level of incompetence even as obvious as
it was that there should have been
people watching this thing even as
obvious as that is a big organization is
simply not competent in general
for everything and the odds of somebody
like Epstein taking advantage of that
incompetence
pretty good pretty good so I will so I'm
going to put my bet on ultimately there
will be incompetence there may still be
some question about why somebody was
incompetent
that may never be answered because you
can't prove a negative so if it comes
down to you know this guard or this
official should have done X but they did
Y and Y is incompetent was it
intentional
probably never know
because if it was just incompetence you
could never sort that out from somebody
who acted incompetently intentionally
because they had a payoff now could you
check the financial records or something
else of the the person who is
responsible and find out if they had
taken a payoff
nope because if they accepted
cryptocurrency for their payoff
can you track it
if if a prisoner says to a guard hey
guard
I'll give you a million dollars in in
Bitcoin
if you look the other way and the
guard's going to say um I don't think
you can do that
and and then Epstein says I'll tell you
what open up a crypto wallet
and you give me your numbers or better
yet here's a phone number
call my assistant and just say my name
is Bob
and I've been asked to call and give you
these numbers I'll just give you these
numbers and it gives out the the code
for his wallet
then Epstein's assistant behind the
scenes takes Epstein super secret crypto
and sends a million dollars to the guard
no record
right
now maybe somebody who knows more than
 about crypto than I do can they
answer whether that's whether I'm
speaking correctly I'm not the expert
here
[Music]
um so
could you make a crypto let's say
Bitcoin bribe that was undetectable in
the normal scheme of things
I think so right let me know if I'm
wrong about that
all right
um
let's talk about
so the U.S state Department I don't know
if you saw this story but this is really
interesting they updated their
definition of anti-semitism so
apparently there I didn't even know this
but there's a there's an official
um there was a 10 point
checklist of whether you're being
anti-semitic and they they increase that
to 11. the explanation is that it's in
response to Elon Omar's U.S
representative Omar's anti-israel
um machinations
and so the new the new definition has
added so this has been added to the the
existing things that say if you do these
things you're anti-Semitic
that anti-Semitism now includes quote
drawing comparisons of contemporary
Israeli policy to that of the Nazis
so if you compare Israel to the Nazis
you're anti-semitic now not Israel but
Israel policy so I want to be very clear
we're not it's not a description of the
people
it's a description of Israeli policy
compared to Nazi policy so if you do
those things you are anti-Semitic
now uh and the leader of the us-based
pro-israel organization praised the move
so here's what I'm wondering
given that Israel is a big supporter of
President Trump and president Trump is a
big supporter
of Israel
especially Israeli policy has is Trump
complaining about Israeli policy
maybe in some ways but I don't know that
he is I don't think he is right
I don't know that President Trump
disagrees with anything important on
Israeli policy in fact
president Trump is one of the most
strongly supportive of policy moves the
embassy uh declares Golan Heights uh
part of Israel
um he seems the most pro-israeli policy
person that ever it was now what does
Donnie Deutsch
call the most pro-israeli president of
all time
he calls him a white supremacist
basically Hitler
doesn't that mean that by the state
Department's definition Donnie Deutsch
is anti-Semitic
because if you're if you're criticizing
the person who is most pro-israel and
pro-israel policy in particular because
it's the president so it's it's really
policy that he's dealing with
and you're calling that person literally
uh white supremacist which I think we
all equate with Hiller
um have you come close to or have you
accomplished this the state Department's
new
guideline for what qualifies as
anti-Semitic
just a question
just a question
um
and you can see how
how
Troublesome all of these definitions are
all right
now is it fair for me to keep saying bad
things about Donnie Deutsch
well
Donnie Deutsch has uh has opened the
floodgates
by calling 60 million voters white
supremacist supporters
I think that
that shows us what the new rules are
and in my opinion and by the way this is
an honest opinion
I'm not making up an opinion for
political gain in my honest opinion he
is the moral equivalent of uh Hitler or
the moral equivalent equivalent of uh a
Serial pedophile
meaning that it's the worst of the worst
of the worst level I'm not saying he
does those things I'm saying that at a
memorial level that kind of demonization
of a group
is the worst thing that you could do all
right
um
there's some reporting that the NRA is
in disarray
I guess they've got some leadership
problems
um some some turnover
Etc I guess they're lobbyists quit and
there's some other things so it turns
out that the NRA
may not be as effective as they have
been in the past just because some
internal turmoil there
at the same time
uh
at the same time
uh president Trump has lots of pressure
more pressure than there's ever been to
get something done on on guns
and I can't think of a president who
would be more equipped
to make something happen
and I'm just going to put this out here
imagine if you will
that Trump said you know I'm going to
solve this one thing just because I can
and he just he just took the NRA and
said hey NRA help me with this and after
the third time he asked the NRA to help
and after the third time they don't
and and the President says I'm I'm
exposed here
you don't have a choice anymore
if you could either help me that's first
choice
or I'm gonna tear you apart
I think the president is on the verge
because his own you know career and
Legacy et cetera is being influenced by
the NRA and they're not they're not
really as productive as he needs them to
be
I think he might destroy them
like actually destroy the NRA now when I
say destroy them I mean that he could do
enough damage
just from the bully pulpit he could just
blame him
think about it
this president
could say look I've been pro-nra from
the jump
I think they are a value you know
they've been valuable
but I'm asking them for the smallest
changes you know let's say whatever it
is you know better background checks or
whatever and I'm not getting it
we can no longer consider them our
friends
and just tear them apart
I think this President could do that I
think somebody says he'd lose his base
would he
would he loses basically NRA cooperated
let's say the NRA says yeah you know we
didn't push for this before but we do
need to make some changes now let's say
the NRA cooperated with with the
president loses base then
um
he's not going to blame the NRA because
they gave him 30 million
I don't think that matters anymore do
you do you think that all of the money
from the NRA
would make any difference at this point
because Trump is Raising so much money
compared to the the alternative I don't
think he cares about 30 million Trump
could throw in 30 million of his own
tomorrow couldn't he
he could just say Imagine This
just just imagine this
president comes out and says you know
I'm pro-gun I own a gun I've done pro
NRA from the start but
you can't just do the same things that
aren't working
and I'd be okay with that what we're
doing now you know the collectively all
the things we do aren't working
if you're not willing to change that
get another president
if you want to stick with something you
know doesn't work and is killing you
know X number of people a year get
another president
vote against me I'm going to take him on
and I'm you know I'm going to put in 30
million dollars into my own campaign and
I'm going to give them their check back
whatever
uh all I'm asking
is these Common Sense things and I could
even say we'll try it for a while and
see if it works
you can even say well you know it'll be
a one-year trial a two-year trial
whatever depending on the change and
we'll just see if it works see if it
ruins the country or makes things better
um now I know that
the uh now here's the thing
if the president goes hard at the NRA
and gets a few things changed
that are still within the reasonable
category I don't think it's ever
unreasonable to ask for background
checks I don't think the red flag laws
are necessarily unreasonable they all
have problems and I would acknowledge
that there's no perfect change right
everything has a little friction a
little bit of expense but they are
reasonable by their nature
um they're reasonable by their nature
and you know with the red flag laws
people worry that they'll be used in the
wrong way Etc definitely a risk but I
think we'd see that risk pretty early
and you know I think we would counter it
um
so here's the thing if the president
pushed art in the NRA and said I'll give
you a choice the country no longer will
tolerate no change
they will tolerate a bad change
think about it this is the first time
the country has been willing to accept a
bad change because the only thing we can
no longer tolerate collectively not
talking about myself
is no change
it's the only thing that's intolerable
is no significant change we would even
accept collectively
a bad decision
just to try it out because you know even
bad decisions are not permanent
just something
absolutely just something and it's got
to be enough to make some some kind of
an impact now I think this President
could do this I would fully support him
taking out the NRA if they can't help
I would fully support that but I'm also
supportive of the NRA in general now the
NRA has said
uh and I love this because this is this
is a real strong point I believe it's
true that none of these uh mass
shootings have happened
for people who are members of the NRA
somebody fact checked me on that has
there ever been a mass shooting of
somebody who is a member of the NRA
because I think there's an opportunity
for something interesting here that's
good for everybody
suppose you said let us acknowledge the
power of your organization
to self-police
and let us say that if you're a member
of the NRA you have perhaps
fewer restrictions than other people
is there a way to make that happen in
other words could the NRA be part of the
solution instead of what many people
think is part of the problem could you
not say that people who join the NRA
first of all joining the NRA requires
you to give your name to the NRA does it
not
how can you join the NRA unless they
have your name and if you've joined the
NRA
and they have your name and address
they kind of know you own a gun they
don't know necessarily how many but well
actually they probably do I'll bet you
there's an NRA
survey occasionally that says what kind
of guns do you have Maybe not maybe they
don't want that information to exist but
I wouldn't be surprised if they did
so here's what I'm asking could it be
that we take advantage of the fact that
the NRA absolutely does does seem to if
not cause good behavior it might at
least filter out people who have bad
behavior
could you say that if you're in the NRA
maybe you have you know less
restrictions or something like that
um I would I would be okay with that
because I think you could come up with
some kind of scheme where being in the
NRA helps the NRA helps you as a gun
owner and still doesn't prevent you from
doing whatever Common Sense thing you
want to do
all right
um
did you see the video of candidate yang
crying on stage
um about the the death of a child by
guns did you all see that video
um
in one in one way
I think it was a positive because it
showed his emotion on a so he was pacing
incense he was pacing his base because
his base
feels the same way he does to the point
where it brought him to tears listening
to a mother talk about her daughter
being shot by I don't know stray bullet
or something I I can't remember the
specific situation but it's some tragedy
involving her child and yang broke down
on stage and and cried
now
that's a little bit good because we like
people who have empathy especially if
they're running for an office that has
power if somebody has power you really
want them to have empathy too
because if you have power and no empathy
well your Genghis Khan
all right you know your Pol Pot so you
don't want to have power and no empathy
so you ain't got that right but here's
the thing
do you want a leader who cries in public
well for anything
probably not
because you know we we elect presidents
to go to go over and be our brand to go
over and and negotiate with Kim Jong-un
and Putin and president XI
um once they see your President crying
over one death no matter how tragic
it's one death of somebody he doesn't
know now we we applaud him for his
empathy so I'm certainly not making fun
of it in any way it was a it looked like
a genuine
human reaction somebody say Who's acting
I don't think so yeah
I I just I just don't buy
I don't buy the explanation that he was
acting
um
you know you can't rule it out but I
don't think that's true
so I don't know if that helped him or
heard him something tells me it might
help him to get nominated but it would
hurt him in the
it would hurt him in the general
election should he get so far
um did Biden have another gaffe recently
is his Gaff production
through the roof yet I want to try out a
new nickname for
uh Biden so the president has called him
sleepy Joe
but as we see Maura Biden you have to
ask yourself all right is that a
nickname working you know is Sleepy what
you think of in terms of identifying his
biggest weakness
and energy wise Biden seems pretty good
so the few times that we see him in
public he seems to have good energy
so the the Sleepy part maybe maybe is
not hitting exactly
so somebody suggested to me this and I
don't think this is the first time
you've heard this
but how about Slow Joe
Slow Joe Rhymes so it's stickier there's
actually science to that things that
rhyme
stick in your mind and take on greater
weight than they should there's actually
science that says
that if something Rhymes you think it's
more true
that's a thing that's been tested if it
rhymes as in if the glove doesn't fit
you must equipped the rhyme is not just
for fun the rhyme is functional it makes
you think it's true because it Rhymes
that is how dumb we are the human brain
is so dumb
that if it Rhymes we think it's true I
don't mean every person every time but
on average is far more persuasive so
here's what's good about solojo besides
the fact that it Rhymes it slips off the
tongue really easy
sleepy gel also comes off the tongue
easy so you want that so it's at least
as good
as sleepy and sloppy somebody's saying
sloppy so same thing they they both roll
off the tongue good well so Slow Joe
works that way but here's the other way
it works better if I say Joe is slow
how do you interpret it
let's see in the comments if I say Joe
Biden is slow
what is your interpretation of what that
word means
so I'm just looking at your comments
it'll take a minute for it to uh
to catch up to what I said
um
slow Mojo Jared toll Joe gaffy Joe
people are giving me new suggestions
here
so people seem to like Slow Joe
uh weekend at Biden
all right it's taking a while for your
comments to catch up but here's here's
the punch line to it Slow Joe is
persuasion perfect because it allows the
uh the hearer the audience to fill in
what they think it means that's good
technique the more specific you are the
worse it is so if you said
um Joe Biden has a bad bad vocabulary
that would be the most specific
insult to his intelligence and then if
he doesn't exhibit that or if people
have not noticed that it doesn't connect
you'd say he has a bad vocabulary I know
I haven't noticed
right it might be true but I haven't
noticed so it wouldn't really have any
persuasive
power but when you say you slow this is
a analogous to when Hillary Clinton in
2016 used the
nuclear-powered persuasion that the
Trump campaign was dark
the reason dark works so well and is
also the reason that that word alone
identified that there was a professional
advising them that's when I that's when
I assumed
that the person I called Godzilla must
be advising or at least somebody who was
um learned from him
um chiltini in this case would be the
Godzilla I'm talking about so that word
alone
tipped me off that there was a
professional advising Clinton it wasn't
just political people it was a
persuasion expert and that and the
technique that I identified was that the
word dark allowed you to read into it
your own thoughts
that is nuclear persuasion
slow allows you to read in your own
interpretation does it mean he's
too old
does it mean he doesn't think fast
doesn't mean he has gaps
doesn't mean he was never Smart in the
first place
doesn't mean he won't get much done
because he has low energy it's whatever
you want you end up putting into it
whatever is the most powerful message
for you you actually design your own
persuasion from that stem cell of a of a
sentence or or of a nickname now sleepy
is a little too specific isn't it
because when if I say somebody's sleepy
I don't necessarily think they're dumb I
don't necessarily think they might have
an age issue not necessarily I think
sleepy I think maybe you know he doesn't
show up for enough uh events
not to
powerful
Slow Joe
pretty powerful anyway I'll just put
that out there as a possibility
that one thing I can say for sure is
that nobody can advise this President on
good nicknames
um I just don't think that's a thing he
is so good at it
that
um I don't assume that mine is better or
that he doesn't have a better idea he's
just better at it than other people all
right
I believe that's everything I wanted to
talk about
um
and the headlines were
very interesting today
because it seems like everything that's
happened in the past three weeks stopped
existing
read the headlines on both CNN.com and
foxnews.com so you can see both sides
and ask yourself if there's anything in
the news there was also a story three
weeks ago and there's almost nothing
so this Epstein thing and then on CNN
they have lots of stories about sexual
abuse in the military
which you know there's some topics I
just stay away from they don't have a
persuasion element to them and they're
just icky
yeah
so even even dumb somebody's suggesting
dumb Biden even dumb is too specific
if you said if you had a nickname for
him that was you know dumb Biden
um that would indicate a lack of
technique I would see that and I'd say
no no technique there if I saw a Slow
Joe I'd say whoa there's some technique
that's technique
um Elon Musk supports yang
interesting
um
very interesting
thoughts on the hunt getting canceled
um I don't know too much about the movie
except it's something about Elites
hunting down and shooting other people
or something
um and it's very much like every other
movie
like that you know you have to
here's the question so we have this
rating system which we've all gotten
used to since I don't know since back in
the days of Tipper Gore when she was
trying to get music labeled for how
profane it was which I always supported
by the way because she was not trying to
censor anything although that was the
accusation she was trying to label
things
and I can't disagree with somebody who
wants to accurately label products like
I can't
how is that wrong I mean that um so I
always agreed with temper Gore wanting
to put labels on music so at least you
know what you're buying you could buy it
or not buy it but at least you knew what
it was
and that was hugely controversial
likewise when movies started having
ratings you know R-rated x-rated hugely
controversial
but aren't you all used to it now is
there when was the last time you
complained
about movies having ratings
can you think of the last time you
complained about that and at one time it
was a big deal oh our freedom is being
taken away but eventually you just
realize it's just a system that gives
you more information about what the
product is that's not a problem but it
does also
put some control to prevent some kind of
people from consuming the the edgier
products
what if
we said that movies and content whether
it's video games
with gun violence
are X-rated
by definition
and you have to be an adult to consume
it period
you can't consume now maybe you you'd
put some kind of limit on it let's say
you put a limit that says okay if
somebody gets shot in the movie
you know that's still okay maybe that's
an R rating you know maybe it's gp13
whatever PG-13 but if it's just say one
person gets murdered and maybe they just
talk about it or you hear The Gunshot
and somebody drops and there's one
murderer that's you know the beginning
of the show that it's the crime that
gets solved well maybe that's not
X-rated
because it's about an individual crime
it gets solved there's a happy ending
Etc
but
movies in which Mass numbers of people
are slaughtered
I think we should consider making them
x-rated now it would destroy the entire
industry
that's okay
when was the last time you saw a good
movie
right
it's been a while the last time you saw
a good movie
I I flew recently and you know when
you're flying any movie looks good
because you're flying and you're trapped
for a while so I was flying yesterday
and I opened up the the app on the plane
that lets me see all the new releases do
you know how many new movies out of all
the movies in the world do you know how
many looked interesting enough to even
open up
to even just sample it
none
there wasn't a single movie out of all
movies that was even a little bit
interesting to me
now I'll bet you've had not quite maybe
on the little extreme but I'll bet
you're having that same
um experience
I'll bet every one of you who used to
love movies have discovered that
for some reason they don't work anymore
and I think it has to do with people
changing it could have to do with all
the movies became too much the same
movie that could be it I mean if you
watch somebody says Fast and Furious was
Bonkers but fun
um
yeah Fast and Furious uh but by the
third time you've watched a fast and
furious movie or the 25th time you've
seen a superhero movie you're just
watching the same movie
right you're watching the same movie
over and over and over again so I would
say that the movie industry is sort of
garbage anyway the the last time I
consistently liked movies is when my
stepkids were very young and because
there weren't many things that you could
do with young kids we would watch a lot
of Disney movies
the Disney movies
really good and they didn't have mass
shootings the quality of a typical Pixar
movie The taught the quality of a
typical
um Disney film is pretty good
so I would say let people make any kind
of content they want but we should label
it
and once you're watching mass shootings
all the time I think you have to ask
yourself what's it do to children to see
to have mass shooter content around them
24 hours a day
I don't think there's any chance that
any any professional somebody who knows
children who knows persuasion let's say
a psychiatrist somebody who's an expert
I don't think you could find an expert
who would disagree me on this disagree
with me on the following statement
massive exposure to gun violence
would make somebody who's on the edge
more likely to choose that as a path
I don't think anybody would disagree
with that now how much more likely you
could have a disagreement but if you
have millions of people consuming this
content and some of them are already on
the edge and some of them want to do bad
things
as other people have suggested these
mass shootings are basically fancy
suicides
these are people who want to die
having fun or making a statement or
being remembered some some version of
all those things these are suicides
if you can convince the suicide person
that the first thing they think of is
well maybe it's just me or maybe I
should go get some help which would be
the ideal
that would be a completely different
message it would be the first thing they
think of instead of well the first thing
I think of is massively shooting huge
crowds of people because that's all the
content I've been consuming every day
for the last 10 years
if you started seeing those movies for
the first time
or you haven't seen many because you
know there would be some leakage you'd
obviously see a few but if you didn't
get to see them on the regular until you
were 18
would it have the same impact on your
thinking I don't know maybe we could
test it
um
I I I've seen some statistics well not
statistics but an opinion they said that
um watching violent video games is not
correlated with these shootings
because everybody watches violent video
games but not everybody becomes a
shooter
to which I say
oh my God if you analyze that wrong
here's how you analyze that show me how
many mass shooters never watched any of
this content
because there's got to be somewhere that
there's a kid maybe either religious or
whatever and they just don't have access
to television and movies
how many people let's say they're raised
in the ultra religious
um household there must be somewhere a
religious community in which people are
pro-gun meaning that they have them for
self-defense but they just won't let you
watch any Hollywood movies because
they're just so depraved those people
must exist there must be enough of them
that we could measure whether or not
they produce Mass killers
I'll bet you they produce zero
the people who have had no exposure to
them I'll bet they have zero Mass
Shooters now I don't know how many
people you could find I mean maybe it
would be hard to get a sample but that's
the question I'd be asking I'd be asking
if if you're having that at the top of
your mind what is the likelihood you'll
do it versus you're just never exposed
to it they can't be the same they just
can't be the same
I mean I'm willing to to find out I'm
wrong but I don't believe they could do
the same
all right
um more violent video games in the last
50 years and less actual violence
um on a one-to-one basis that's true so
I told you I was reading that book
American nations I think it's called
about the beginning of the United States
and I'll tell you the history that you
learned about America is so freaking
wrong
now it's not wrong in terms of the the
big picture you know the history you
learned is you know on this date there
was an American Revolution and America
won you know so the big stuff your
history is correct but it turns out that
the earlier early colonial life
was basically an entire country
full of freaking bastards
the the
thought that we would um
let's say turn into Heroes the early
founders of this country you'll lose
that entirely if you learn about the
actual way the early country was these
were bad people period
the founders of this country were Bad
Dudes
on on the whole I mean there were some
good ones thrown in there but the people
who had power you know the the big
landowners and even the people in the
north were slave owners they just had
fewer of them that's it Not only was
there
um the slave trade that came from Africa
but the only reason that the African
slave trade happened is literally the
landowners ran of white people to
enslave
they were enslaving white people until
they ran out of they just didn't have
enough they had more more crops than
they had white people to enslave in
those days if you were the landowner and
let's say the king of England had said
you know you get Pennsylvania or you get
this area
you were the judge in the jury you could
execute
anyone in your territory
because you were the judge and the
Executioner you could just take somebody
say I think this guy stole my cow and
just killed him
and it was legal completely legal it was
legal for the powerful people to murder
people who happen to live in their land
because they were the judge they'd make
up the law and then they'd kill them
so the early Americans
were horrible people they they were
routinely massacring the Native American
tribes routinely
and and there weren't it's not like
there were some good ones you know good
settlers and bad settlers the settlers
were just horrible just horrible people
all the time by modern standards
uh you know they seem pretty horrible by
those standards too but in those days
the the idea that the rich landowner was
sort of a God who could really control
the lives and deaths literally life and
death of everybody in their domain was
actually accepted
because they they didn't really have
too much knowledge of the Alternatives
and it was only you know small sex that
had the idea that everybody should be
treated equally and get a vote and stuff
like that but as luck would have it
you know that was the the school of
thought that became dominant
um and probably because of the Civil War
you know if we didn't fight a civil war
uh maybe the southern view that the rich
landowners could have a lot of power
might have been the way we were living
right now it might be a bunch of
fiefdoms
uh the other thing I didn't realize is
that all of the colonies hated each
other to the point of War
so the colonies
freaking hated each other and here when
I say colonies I don't mean even
official colonies but all the the little
groups of settlers
all around they they were very warlike
in general
um
so I'll tell you anytime anybody talks
about Western culture
um I now think murderous slavers because
it turns out that if you were to
categorize them generally you know
obviously there are some good people in
the group and they were just people who
loved God in the group and so they're
plenty of good people but if you were to
characterize the average
murderous racist slavers that's who they
were
unapologetically they were overtly
murderous racist
slavers
so
that's kind of and if you say well but
what about the religious tradition there
wasn't a religious tradition there were
people with different religions and they
were willing to kill each other because
the other ones had the wrong religion it
wasn't really a religious tradition it
was all over the board there were people
who were religious weren't different
different
sects the Protestants didn't like the
Catholics there was no religious
um they're standard anyway it's great
but I'll tell you more about it when I'm
done that's all I have for now I'll talk
to you later bye
