hey everybody hey Jeremy come on in
here you know the people who come in
first have a chance of hearing their own
name right Tyler
Tyler and right
Kyle and Amy and Donna and Savannah and
JP if you get here early
sometimes I say your name and when you
get to a th
users then you get to enjoy the
simultaneous
SI if I look a little tired this morning
that's because I'm a little tired this
morning time to join me simultaneous
up oh that's
good so I told you there was an
interesting thing happening with the
coverage of the
president it seemed to me and I gave you
uh I guess there were three examples
yesterday and there's at least one more
today did all of you did you see the
Philip mud interview on CNN
with uh Bard is his last name I forget
his first name a trump
supporter uh and the net of it is that
Phil mud was was you know yelling get
out get out during an onair interview he
was yelling at somebody get out he
seemed to be melting
down well that was the fourth
example of what appeared to be um Trump
support
anti-trumpers who were embarrassed by
other
anti-trumpers because if you look at the
host who who was trying to monitor this
situation he had that look on his face
like oh this guy's on my side what do I
do I want to stop him and I'm
embarrassed but this guy's on my side oh
Paris Bard yes that was his name who did
a very good job on that interview by the
way very good job staying um on
message so so we saw uh if I could
remember my examples uh PR barara
another Trump uh
disliker who who cautioned uh Bill Maher
back from saying um traitor so he was
like well you know that's not helping
goes a little too far we saw
Clapper actually come out
against Brennan's uh rhetoric not
against Brennan or his message but
against his rhetoric and said the
rhetoric wasn't
helping did you see that
coming um so it seems to me me that
something interesting happened in the
last week and what I think it
is is that the
anti-trumpers are starting to hold up a
mirror to
themselves now the way the Mirror Works
is that you don't see yourself exactly
in this case what you see is someone who
is on your team who has gone too far and
you're watching them and you're saying
um do I look like that because I'm on
this person's team and they're
definitely going too
far I'm not sure I want to be on this
team CU it's a little bit
embarrassing um I'm going to claim
partial success on my uh prediction
which I got wrong uh early on when I
said that in the first year I predicted
that uh anti-trumpers would become
embarrassed
at their
opinions now I thought the reason would
be that things would be going so well
that people would just be embarrassed
that they thought it
wouldn't but it's very clearly
embarrassing at this point am I wrong I
mean I might be reading too much into
this so you know here's one of these
points if I can teach you
anything um here's one of those moments
where you have to check yourself and say
is this confirmation bias
because everything that I've described
so far totally could be and I wouldn't
know the difference so I'm going to ask
you maybe to do a little you know uh
conceptual fact checking on me here
somebody says still too early still too
early is a reasonable
comment but I'm feeling it right now and
it looks like it's might be part of a
trend but there's a second part of the
story that gets more
interesting and I forget who said it
first
but I saw Molly Hemingway um she might
have been the one who noticed it first
that there's something like a loop going
on I hope that was Molly's comment there
might have been somebody who also was in
this story that I'm
forgetting and she noted how the
anti-trumpers go through uh certain
loops and the loop is uh he's a racist
he's a racist and then he does something
for you know black employment and then
they get off that for a little while and
then it's he's he's a colluder he's a
Trader he's a Trader and then if that's
not working out and Mueller isn't coming
through and there's no evidence and it's
not looking like there's going to be
anything in that then they get off of
that Loop a little while and they they
get on to the uh oh he's crazy he's
insane he's losing his mind he's
mentally ill and it looks like they were
trying that out
yesterday so here's the situation
it looks like anti- trumpers are
becoming embarrassed at their own team I
that's what it looks
like it looks like they're flailing
around to find the next Loop because
it's not it's not so organized that
there's really an order that comes down
from the top and then they all do the
same
thing it AB it absolutely was that
organized during the campaign when
Hillary Clinton such started saying it's
a dark speech dark dark dark all the
anti-trumper networks and pundits said
dark at the same time that one was very
clearly a memo you know the memo came
down they knew what to say they all said
it at the same time but with the this
Loop situation it's a little more
freerange chickens they're looking at
other people and saying okay it looks
like looks like on MSNBC they're going
for the crazy thing all we'll try the
crazy thing but they haven't quite
settled on it but here the good part uh
know how you know how I've taught you
that if you're trying to figure out what
a news organization thinks should be the
big story it's always at the top of
their page and on the left and the top
left is where the important stuff is
because that's the way we read you know
you're going to look at the top left
first and you might I forget the pattern
but you do top left first and then you
go somewhere but I forget but the point
is whatever they put in the top left is
what they think they want you to know
every single time I've talked about
CNN's page what has been in the top
left you already know the answer the top
left has been Trump did this Trump is
outrageous Trump did this Trump trump
Trump trump Trump trump Trump trump let
me read you all the stories on the top
left
of uh
CNN something about the Vatican
something about the pope something about
Justice for the dead but not the living
but Trump isn't mentioned I don't know
what that is something about a cardinal
something about priests and something
else about the
church Trump is not on the top left of
CNN is that a
coincidence it's not a coincidence
because they're out of
and they're reloading and they don't
know where they're going
next um I think that the brenen thing
you know going full
traitor and then losing his
clearance and losing it because of you
know being erratic or going too far they
tried to they tried to ride that hard
and they tried to turn that into my God
it's the first
amendment but here again see an any is
trying to make you think past the
sale let me explain this all of the
coverage from CNN and MSNBC about Bren
losing his security
clearance said something like this it's
bad for freedom of speech it's chilling
he's trying to stop Bren from
Talking what does that make you think
past you always have to see what they're
making you think past if they're talking
about whether it's chilling to free
speech they have made you think past the
question of what of whether it was
true see the if Brennan was an absolute
um bad character a bad actor this is if
allegedly and he was trying to bring
down the president with total BS
wouldn't that be the
story wouldn't that be the story if the
ex- head of the CIA were part of the
deep State and part of a plot to take
down the
president that's the
story not the fact that that guy
allegedly allegedly not the fact that
that guy lost his security clearance do
you know one of the reasons that you
might lose your security clearance
trying to overthrow the United
States that would be a reason let's say
let's say uh somebody it doesn't have to
be Brenan a hypothetical person who had
security clearance became an actual
traitor and tried to overthrow the
United States and let's say in my
hypothetical we know this is true let's
say we know it's
true should that person lose their
security clearance
yes yes they should would anybody argue
that would they say but what about the
Traders Free
Speech what about the Traders ability to
get a job are you trying to discourage
other traders in the future are you
trying to shut them up so they can't
complain no nobody would say that
because they would say that's of course
how you treat a Trader if somebody's
trying to play a coup for no
compellingly good reason that person
needs to lose their security clearance
and that is not a question of free
speech so if you watched all of the
coverage on CNN it was all making you
think past that question and to make you
think past it as though Brennan had a
good point and he was not a traitor
trying to overthrow the country now do I
personally know if he is or is is not a
Trader trying to overthrow the country
no how the hell would I know that so
that's why I'm saying alleged every four
or five words here CU I would not make
that claim without pretty solid
information all right I would need a lot
of information and I'd have to be really
certain of it to say that somebody was
trying to overthrow the
country and I don't have that what we do
have is a series
of let's say facts and evidence that
certainly do paint that
picture but if I've taught you anything
and here I'm getting back to
confirmation bias is it possible that
John Brennan could be not a traitor and
not trying to overthrow the country do
do the facts suggest that that's
possible I'd say yes it's possible
if you ask me does it look like that no
it doesn't look like that at all to me
it looks exactly like the evidence
clearly suggests he was part of a small
group of people who were trying to
change the election because they didn't
like the
outcome that's what it looks like but
you can't take that the fact that
there's really a lot of suggestive
evidence for that case that doesn't make
it true because remember the other side
is seeing something exactly like this
for president Trump if you're an
anti-trumper you're saying the same
thing I just said but you put a
different name in there you you would
say well look at all the evidence that
the Trump
Administration um was
uh was uh colluding now I don't think
that happened and I don't think the
evidence shows that at all in fact when
you look at the Trump situation what is
the first thing that the Trump or say
and the first thing is usually your best
evidence what's the best evidence that
people present when they say yeah right
uh Trump Administration was colluding
with Russia the best evidence was that
lawyer who had a meeting once and when
she had that meeting as I've said other
times if she had done what she promised
it would have been totally
legal but she didn't do it which is give
the Trump campaign information about
Hillary if she had done it totally legal
totally legal but she didn't even do it
that's two full levels away from being
illegal two full
levels and that's their best evidence
that Trump
colluded and the other one was the joke
he said about hey Russia if you can find
those emails literally a joke now I'm
seeing some uh push back by the way did
you notice did you notice I became part
of that
story um I have the strangest
life because I'm I'm literally you know
I'm just sitting here in my office you
know all by myself in
California and I'm talking to you on my
iPad sitting in front of me and I'm
talking about a story and the next thing
I know I am the story you know I look on
Fox news site and there's a big story
about me and how I have declared that
Brennan couldn't take a joke or didn't
recognize a joke when Trump said hey
Russia if you have those emails now I
stand by
that with complete confidence and what's
funny about it is that people question
my capability to recognize a
joke I have written a joke a day at
least one in most most days more than
one for 30
years let's do the
math hey Siri what is
365 *
30 the answer is
10,950 so yeah so I've written somewhere
in the neighborhood of
11,000 jokes that became in comics if
you add on top of that the books I've
written Etc I'd say I've
written 12 to 15,000
jokes I'm kind of an expert on it I have
lit literally written chapters and books
on how to construct
jokes um I have I used to have a
thriving speaking career in which I
mostly um presented
jokes or humor and let's
say somebody says are you joking um and
people ask me if I was a good expert at
at recognizing a joke to which I say yes
oh I'm going to switch topics this has
nothing to do with anything except I'm
going to vent a little bit something
that's been driving me crazy you see
this
um it's jackery makes it it's a little
uh it's an extra battery for your phone
I'm going to make a complaint about this
product but it's a complaint about most
electronic products so it's not just
about these people all right so it's an
extra battery here's the general
complaint the general complaint is that
people make products and they don't have
anybody test them not anybody before
they go to market why do I know that's
true all right let me explain if you
have a
smartphone to for which you would use an
extra battery would you be using that
smartphone in a bright light every time
you used it no you would not in fact
many times you use a smartphone it's in
the dark so what would be the dumbest
thing you could do to design a product
that's worked that you use in dark
light much if not most of the time what
would that look like would it look
like something that has black button on
a black
surface no you would not that would be
the dumbest thing you could ever do the
dumbest product you could ever make is
one that that is meant to be used on in
low light that's a black product with a
black battery but am I done yet oh no
I'm not done the great thing about this
is that it purports well there we go it
purports to have two cool Jacks which is
a very good feature by the way one is
iPhone and then the other one I use for
my um it's the micro USB so I use it for
my uh
headphones so it's very a very good
feature so here's the positive part
about it very good feature that you have
both of those but here's the thing when
they're both in how do you know which
side is the one you want at any given
minute well it's very clearly labeled up
here in a way that you can't see in the
dark all right so now they made it
symmetrical and identical so in the dark
you can't even feel which way is the
right way not only that but the front
and the back are identical in the dark
The Edge is identical The Edge is
identical and it's worse the bottom
where there's nothing you
want is the same shape as the top where
there are two things you want or
three now how many times when I want to
use this do I have to go um oh no it's
this side no it's this side no it's this
side how many times do I have to do that
every freaking time every single time
time every time okay now I have a little
bit of the same complaint with my
iPhone but at least the iPhone I can
usually find that the the fingerprint
thing is a little different than the top
and the front is different from the back
so I'm like well that's better here's
the next problem in order to charge this
you need to use this little um U micro
USB if you've ever tried to put a micro
USB into a micro USB slot in the dark
what do you find how many times do you
put it in upside
down half the
time all you'd have to do is make this
device a little bit different on one
side than the other so that you can tell
the top from the bottom and the left
from the right reliably in the dark and
then they put the USB just just above
the or the USB right below the micro USB
so if it's in the dark what are you
doing the whole time you're shoving your
thing into the USB which is the wrong
hole everything about this product is
designed wrong but you know what it
looks cool in the light if you show this
to somebody in the light hey engineer
look what I made and the other engineer
says hey this is perfect look I love
this feature you've got all the the
places here it's even got a flashlight
built in
this is great in bright
light in bright
light
so most of the products in my house have
the same problem here we have an
excellent product by the way I highly
recommend them Bose head wireless
speakers but wait do I use these in the
light half the time and half the time I
use them in the dark if you're going to
use them in the the dark would you put
black buttons on a black surface well in
this case it's not so bad because you
can find them easily if you have them on
right if you have them on right you know
that the buttons are back here and not
back here so you can learn that but
what's the problem half the time you put
them on backwards why because
yes they are labeled left and
right
somewhere but I can't find
it cuz I I can't really tell what's left
and what's right who tested this stupid
thing nobody nobody ever tested this
product cuz if they had the engineer
would have watched them do no that's not
right and then the engineer would have
said oh let's make it so it's more
obvious what's the left and what's the
right then let's say you want to charge
it here's a black hole on a black
surface which you can't tell is going to
be on this one or on this one so it
could be this one or this one and it
could be left you know upside down or
right side so it takes me two to three
tries to figure out which side the hole
is on nobody tested this product nobody
tested this product I bought a I bought
an outdoor
umbrella um recently it's a canal lver
meaning it's a big sort of a flat
umbrella that you unroll and then once I
unrolled it part of it is that the the
little arms you stick into a a cloth
holder for the arms and that's what
keeps the umbrella on the the metal
structure and as I was putting it
together I looked at these little cloth
holders and I thought to myself wow it
looks to me like even a slight bit of
wind would just rip these little cloth
holders right off and and I walked out
the other day and under a very slight
wind the umbrella ripped itself
apart exactly what it looked like as
soon as I looked at I saw well this
doesn't look like it's very sturdy looks
like the wind would even just a light
wind would just rip it apart and a light
wind came and ripped it apart now you
can't tell me that whoever designed that
umbrella ever put it
Outdoors nobody ever tested that
Outdoors because if they had they would
have seen it ripped apart in a week it
was never
tested so if you've got if you're an
engineer and you're making a product and
you're testing it in the light and your
boss says you don't need to test it with
actual users in the dark why would you
do that it works perfectly well in
bright light say to your boss well you
should have watched this Periscope now I
hope I I I I hope hope I've uh saved
saved all of you some future problems
because this is the sort of periscope
that Engineers will probably pass around
um I'm a little
bit uh monal on this point because I
used to work in a user interface design
um area in the phone
company and we would uh somebody said I
lost all respect for you for this
um I W I wish I could tell you how many
times in my life somebody told me that
they had lost all respect for
me you you you should uh you know spend
like a minute in my brain it's like it's
like the the texture of my life is
somebody being very disappointed in
me
so
um all right well I'm glad that at least
somebody likes me for it uh and I used
to watch the user interface tests if you
haven't seen this you uh oh I'm going to
talk about RP ICT in a moment if you
haven't seen user interface testing it's
very important and you don't need many
people you could bring in five customers
just to hand them the product and say
use this product or you know do it do
with what do with it whatever you want
and you just watch them and and if you
if you had ever done user interface
testing where there's like the engineers
stand behind a two-way mirror and they
just watch the person and they say okay
now turn down the light and hand them
the battery they would see them doing
this every single person would have done
that and they would have changed it so
you know that they didn't do any testing
all right uh you saw who was
the uh who was it who said was it Al
Sharpton I think it was L Sharpton doing
he did a video of uh artha Franklin he
sort of a tribute video and then in the
end he made a call out to her famous
song R
pect uh where she spells it out in the
song except he he spelled respect wrong
r s p i c t now as you might imagine the
internet wasn't crazy because he spelled
that word wrong I am not going to jump
on that
train here's why it was the same week
that the president spelled Council wrong
in a tweet as he has spelled other
things wrong in a
tweet um I too have spelled words wrong
in tweets I too have said equally dumb
things on
Periscope um the fact that he spelled
that word
wrong I give him a pass yeah the this is
a version of the 48 hour rule cuz
there's nothing really to clarify other
than you know the word was spelled wrong
he doesn't need to clarify that he meant
it that way because obviously he didn't
but I think that's the sort of thing we
got to give people a pass
for when I was you know in my
20s spelling something wrong was the
worst problem in the world because you
would always show it to somebody who
would make sure it was right and you
know calling error was considered just a
horrible problem today I think it makes
more sense to say that we don't use
editors for social media and for a lot
of things we do we just we just do them
and we put out we put out our raw
thoughts you're seeing me do it now and
this is live and unplanned so what are
the odds that I'm going to do or say
something stupid in this very Periscope
pretty good pretty high you know you've
seen me what what was it I did the other
oh let me give you a perfect
example I said in public that I didn't
believe that the First
Amendment um specifically mentioned
freedom of the
press now most of you who saw that
thought my God how stupid of you in
public what I was thinking which was
wrong is that freedom of speech Just
included that so it didn't need to be
spelled out specifically but that was
just wrong and stupid and you know it's
just a hole in my education and you know
it was just a a little bit of ignorance
that I had hanging out there that people
corrected me in public now do I think
I'm an idiot because I didn't know that
and lots of people did know it and it's
certainly something I should have known
not really you know I I talked yesterday
about how to deal with your your
embarrassment and your shame
my total shame and embarrassment for
being that stupid in public lasted
about half a second and then I just said
well there I was being stupid in public
and then I didn't think about it again
until I was looking for an example here
so um I would say give sh give Sharpton
the same pass you would give yourself
this is one of those Golden Rule
situations
we're all stupid in
public everybody is stupid in public if
you spend as much time talking in public
as Al Sharpton does and as I do and as
the president does you're going to say
stupid stuff that doesn't make you
stupid it just means that if you talk
long enough you're always going to say
something dumb all right um
I don't think people were upset about
the misspelled word responding to one of
the comments here I think they just saw
it as an easy line of attack but it's a
cheap attack oh let's talk about uh
Twitter so uh Jack D dorsy was doing
some interviews on the question of what
Twitter is doing
about uh Shadow Banning and censorship
and whatever words you want to put on
that
and the basic situation is that it's on
under study meaning that their their
efforts going on to figure out how to do
it better than they're doing it how to
be more
transparent in those situations I
typically say all right if you recognize
the problem remember how I told you how
to the best way to handle a situation is
that first you have to restate the
problem so Jack did restate the problem
he said he said he understood that they
are left leading he understood what the
issue was and he said then I said you
should also um you know take
responsibility basically apologize which
he did and he and he he literally said
that's on me meaning him and that he
told us what he's doing about it which
is there are a number of things and
they've got an outside group that's
studying it but they're looking deeper
into the entire it sounds like they're
looking at the entire architecture of
the system
to see if the whole liking and
retweeting and the way it's way it's
organized even makes sense anymore which
is very interesting um now I see some of
you saying that he doesn't mean it he's
lying blah blah blah I say the evidence
does not suggest
that the evidence does suggest that
conservatives are getting uh edited in a
way that others are not but it doesn't
suggest that he personally is tweaking
that algorithm or that he doesn't want
to fix it I don't think that's an
Evidence
so uh I think Twitter gets um gets a
pass from me for not completely Banning
Alex Jones for example uh and clearly
saying the saying the right things and
acting on it and treating with treating
it with some dignity meaning that the
issue is important and he's clearly
taking it seriously so that's a wait and
see for
me so I know you want to pile on Twitter
but I'd say give Twitter a little time
they say they're working on it if you
don't like how it comes out then you can
criticize but if they're saying words
like
transparency uh and they're
acknowledging that they're that they
lean left and that they need to figure
out how to fix this I let their
Ingenuity percolate a little bit they
might be able to come up with something
we'll
see all right
um algorithms will never fix
it I think you're right I don't think
algorithms will ever fix it I think it
has I think it's going to have to do
more with people choosing what they see
and maybe a little bit better labeling
of things let me ask you this if if your
Twitter feed went by and every tweet had
a color code next to it to tell you
among other things let's say it told you
that other people think it's fake
news let's just say that and let's say
if it was colorcoded you know orange it
means that other people have ranked it
fake news that doesn't mean it is but
you would be at least alerted the some
number some amount of the public has
ranked it as fake news now maybe it's
only ranked fake news by other news
organizations maybe only blue check
people can rank something fake news that
would seem unfair to people but I'm just
throwing out some ideas so I would like
to see all the information and then have
a choice of you know deselecting it if
if I got used to seeing the oranges and
every time I saw an orange it was fake
he like oh that orange again it's
totally fake you know don't don't show
any show don't show me any more orange
stuff as long as I have that choice and
I know what other people thought about
it what other people thought about the
tweet I feel like I'd have everything I
needed and then you know if they block
stuff because it's violent or suggests
you know if they say something if it's
you know actually racist violent you you
know there there's some level Beyond
which you know stuff about children or
whatever there's some level Beyond which
we all expect a little bit of
editing so I think you it feels like you
could get there pretty easily but I
don't know all right um I'm going to try
hard to do a a second Periscope today
that I tried to do this weekend but I
couldn't get there and it will be um a
house tour and I'll be talking about
blight authority.com where I hope all of
you have gone there are a lot of ideas
coming in flowing in about what to do
about these
blighted areas that uh have been cleared
or need to be cleared in the inner
cities so when I show you my house let's
all agree that my house is not a model
for what to build in the inner cities
you you get to see the the rich guy
house but I'm going to use it as sort of
a talking point to tell you you what
kinds of things to think about if you're
building a home so you're not going to
build it the same way obviously because
there's a you know there's an income
difference but I'll give you a bunch of
ideas that maybe you haven't heard
before and I'll try to do that today and
I will talk to you later
