do do
[Music]
[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and on a
slow news day like today it's exactly
where you want to be because what would
you rather be doing sleeping in No
Nonsense you want to be here and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that even Canada could not
understand all you need is a couple of
my girl glass of tanker Charles is Diana
canteen Joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's a dopamine
the day the thing makes everything
better I will stipulate it's called the
simultaneous sip when it happens now go
ah
so good
I I saw a reference to the men who live
alone uh die die younger
and the joke was no it just seems like
it
or no I don't know what the joke was but
that's one of those backwards
correlation ones
who do you think people marry
people who look like they're going to
die pretty soon or people who look
healthy
I got a feeling that nobody marries
somebody who looks like they're going to
die so
probably married people do live longer
yep
so there's a big old festival called
birding man and things went wrong
I don't know can you believe it that
there's a big Festival that famous
people went to and if something went
wrong
hello whoever heard of this a thing like
that but I well there was a flood that
turned their dirt into mud and and now
oh God
the the experts were right you can't
actually talk about burning man for more
than 30 seconds without falling asleep
let's try it again
well there's a festival it's called A
Burning Man
and there's mud
nobody cares about Burning Man
unless you're there
how many of you are at birding man
no nobody
can we all agree can we can we stipulate
that we don't care what happens
I mean I hope everybody's safe
but we don't care if they're muddy and
we don't really care if
you don't care at all basically
so there's uh in the on social media I
saw a report of that
study that says Ivermectin really worked
well
so
does that sound credible
there's a study that has something to do
with something about the pandemic
is the study incredible
oh let me look at the details Scott no
you don't get to look at the details
well how will I know if it's a
randomized controlled trial or not now
answer the question without knowing that
but but but what if it's done by really
credible people no answer the question
the answer is no there's no credible
data that has ever come out of the
pandemic nothing not nothing that agrees
with you nothing that disagrees with you
no freaking idea
we we will forever go to the end of our
days not really knowing what happened
but that allows everybody to assume
they're the ones who got it right
so I guess that's good
how many of you heard a an audio which
I'm suspecting is not real
but I don't know in what way it would
have been faked that alleges uh
that James Clapper
is on there being allegedly
interviewed about something sounds like
a legal context
and if any of it were true it would be
shocking to the point of unbelievable
and what do I say when you see news
stories that are unbelievable
they're almost always not true
now the online defense is that it wasn't
really James Clapper
do you believe that
do you know who would start who would
start an argument that it was really
another guy oh and the other guy that
people say this
it's really sad but tragically he died
recently yeah yeah the person who they
say it was uh died in May so
coincidentally the person who was who
sounds exactly like Clapper
who really wasn't
he sounds exactly like him and also
coincidentally died
let's say that's two really big
coincidences for the same person died
recently just when we'd want to talk to
him and also sounds exactly like
somebody that nobody else in the world
sounds like
I'll bet you you could take seven eight
billion people you wouldn't find one
that sounded like Clapper but we found
one recently died recently died yeah
now
why should you believe about this story
nothing
there's not a single credible part of
this story I would tell you what he said
it's you know real conspiratorial stuff
the the essence of it is
that some prominent deep State member
whose name I won't mention because it's
not credible enough is behind a bunch of
blackmail schemes of notable people
you've heard of
the the only thing it has in his favor
is as bipartisan
so it doesn't seem to be you know just
pro-democrat or pro-republican sounds
like something that would involve both
parties
so
that's the only thing that gives it a
little feel of maybe true but it's it's
Way Beyond is way below the line of
credibility
but it's fun
if you'd like to know for sure
if it's Clapper that would be easy
because there are programs I think you
probably you know Google it and it would
come right up there is a way to check if
somebody's word pattern usage matches
their past pattern of usage and if
somebody's just speaking off the top of
their head which is what the audio
purports
you can match it pretty much every time
it'd be like a 98 chance you could match
it so if anybody cared
you just go find one of those language
matching apps match it up to things he
said before and you would know for sure
but I'm not going to tell you what he
said you can look at it on online I just
don't want to repeat it more than
more than I have to
but it would be shocking and change the
world if it were true
all right Israel is having a problem
with uh African immigrants
I guess they had a big brawl in Tel Aviv
and hundreds were involved in Broadway
and rioting and so Netanyahu says he's
going to deport the Africans
do you think that's going to happen
do you think he's really going to deport
Africans from Israel
I don't know I've got I've got my doubts
maybe he'll Deport people who were no
you know captured on video causing
trouble
you might do that but do you think he's
going to take every Africa
you know a few hundred had it right
can he get can he get away with that
politically domestically
because I got a feeling that the
Israelis are pretty much against
discriminating
release a lot of them I don't know I
wouldn't speak for all of them but I
would think that there's a because of
their history
presumably there would be very against
targeting any any group of ethnic people
I'm not sure he'll get away with it
I mean you said he'd do it
but who knows if that's really going to
happen who knows we'll keep an eye on
that it might be a you know Canary in
the coal mine for something happening
over here but I doubt it
I doubt it
uh
representative Nancy mace who continues
to be one of the more interesting people
in politics only because she says stuff
you're not supposed to say on TV
and so here's something she said out
loud on
CNN and CNN aired it without bleeping it
and they replayed it without bleeping it
so she said she was talking about how
the Republicans are handling the issue
of abortion and she said quote we cannot
be to women
huh
and I thought oh that's perfect
that that's that's my exact opinion the
political part of my opinion I don't
give you my own opinion on abortion
because as I often say
leave it to women
you know I'll just follow the leader
women if women want it to be illegal in
my state
all agree if they wanted to be illegal
in my state I'll just say it wasn't my
decision
so
but Nancy mace is a woman and she's got
a a credible right to her opinion on
this and I like the fact that she's
calling it out the the political element
of it
the political element of it is
you're going to have to
make sure that women are okay with
whatever it is the Republicans say or
you're not going to win any elections
now that's different from the issue of
what you think about abortion itself I'm
just talking about the messaging the
messaging has to be a little Smarter on
the Republican side I would I would say
it's lacking quite a bit
um and that it's probably 50 percent
less good than it could be the messaging
part
without changing the message
so I would listen to Nancy Mason
messaging she seems really good on that
stuff
um
so I saw a tweet from Joe Biden saying
that
diversity is
the thing that he's working for
you he's trying to get that diversity up
in the country
and here's my reframe on diversity
diversity is a goal
right I mean that's what the President
says we want more diversity it's a goal
goals are stupid
in general
just in general goals are suboptimal I
wrote a book about it it's the most
famous thing I've ever done
there are many books on Amazon right now
they have picked up that point the
systems are better than goals and you
know they're they're like a whole
explosion of books on the very point the
systems are better than goals but who
doesn't know that apparently the
president of the United States one of
the most one of the most basic
understood truths of business and life
and being effective is that you need a
system
if all you have is a goal you're in
trouble now what what would you do if
you treated diversity as a goal
you would take from people who have what
you want now this would be true of
equity or diversity because because
diversity is just part of equity so
let's just say let's just say Equity
instead because I'd say diversity is a
subset of the larger question of equity
so Equity if that's your goal
what do you do about it
well if it's a goal and some people have
more and some people have less it's
pretty obvious you take from the people
who have more you give it to the people
who have less boom problem solved that's
that's why a goal-oriented approach
gives you
one approach
take money from the people who have it
give it to the people who don't
now suppose you had instead a systems
approach what would that look like what
would be a system
something that you could do every day
that would get you not only something
closer to equity
because I'm not saying that's a bad
thing you know at least in terms of a
you know directional thing that
everybody wants to be better
but I wouldn't say Equity is the goal
you should you should try to be better
than average everybody should and you
should work on personal development
so personal development a lifetime of
personal development
makes racism trivial in your life
because you would be so much more
powerful than the forces against you but
it also makes you much more likely
to get closer to that Equity range or at
least have a good good life for yourself
and your family
than anything else would
so the big problem with Democrats is
they have goals they sound pretty good
what they don't have is a system to get
there and Republicans continue to let
them slide on that and the problem is
that you haven't you haven't collected
your
complaints into one good frame
use Republicans say for example family
is good we should have more family stuff
how
how what are you doing you're just
talking that's a goal
right if you're not telling me what to
do about it but I would say that in the
past a family was a system wouldn't you
family as an organizer is a system
that's worked worked forever
how about religion
religion is not really a goal it's more
like a system something you're you know
paying attention to every day you're
building your life around it Etc you're
practicing it on Sundays especially
that's the system
what about uh free market
free market system
right so Republicans are
you know pretty close to an a you know
grade A for understanding that a system
is better than a goal
Democrats are just goal oriented
uh get rid of guns
that's our goal what I mean just just
get rid of them yeah yep that's the goal
just get rid of them
maybe you should think through all the
ramifications
nope get rid of them
uh what about too many people in jail oh
the goal is to have fewer people in jail
so what do you do
if you have a goal-oriented mindset what
do you do if there are too many people
in prison
let them out yeah bail reform just let
them out
so every time you have a goal-oriented
approach
you're not just different politically we
have to be a little bit more honest
about this that's actually stupid
and it's stupid according to literally
everybody
I just have to describe it in that frame
and everybody agrees oh shoot when you
say it that way it is stupid
it's not a political difference
see this is the thing we keep getting
wrong because do you think there are a
lot of Republicans who don't want people
to do well because they're minorities
no
no no but they have a system which is
I'll take care of my family and make
sure we've got homeschooling because
homeschooling is what
it's a system
right
so the public schools were a system but
then they broke
so then the Republicans more so than the
Democrats said well our our system is
broke so what's the point of having a
goal of getting everybody well educated
if you don't have a system that can do
it
so the Republicans immediately moved to
an alternate system homeschooling
Etc mostly homeschooling right and then
you see the homeschooling system
thriving
because systems are better than goals
so every time you see this argument
where there's a Democrat who's got a
goal that just sounds terrific
but their system is just you
should call it out for being part of the
stupid approach to life you don't even
have to talk about the individual case
just say just in general
goals for their system or how stupid
people act
systems that can work in a variety of
ways including get you closer to
something like equity
always work
yeah if it's a good system it always
works
so
as soon as the the moment you you allow
yourself to go into their frame you lose
so the frame of the Democrats is you
have my stuff you owe it to me
if you argue that
you're in the wrong argument they may
they made you think past the sale into
their argument the argument should be oh
wait is that a goal-oriented approach
you have there
oh well I'm not going to talk about that
I'm not not too interested in a goal but
if there's a system
they could get all of us what we want
let's talk about that and make that
system work really well but a goal now I
the diversity should not be a goal
diversity issue is something that should
be something that happens on its own
because everybody had a good system for
advancement
Equity is should not be a goal
it should be something that derives
naturally out of a good system because
everybody has you know a chance to get
educated everybody can do whatever they
want
this is whiteboard material it probably
will be
yeah it does need to be physical but uh
now now watch how well I sold this okay
most of the things that I you know try
to sell you so to speak sell it but um
in my live streams wouldn't you say most
people disagree like well not most
people but everything I propose as an
idea plenty of people are going to be on
the other side
even if it's a good idea there's always
plenty of people but but watch this
how many people think I'm wrong
the systems are better than goals and
that's the entire problem here
watch watch the comments it's a hundred
percent there won't be a single person
who disagrees something
it's that it's that
it's really that easy
if you have the right frame you get the
right result so you have to reframe it
from the political opinion to systems or
smart and goals are stupid and there's
never an exception to that
there won't be any exceptions to them so
yeah you have to go to the argument that
you're going to win stay out of their
argument
stay out of that hole who's got more
who's got less who has a bad history who
is the victim who's the oppressor don't
even engage
those are arguments that unproductive
people have but you're not one of them
now
maybe before too
all right um
I saw a headline on CNN that I thought
was going to be one thing and turned
into another that the headline was that
the uh the hosts of an ABC show new show
with Stephanopoulos the hosts were
shocked
to learn that the polling for the
president if it were Biden versus Trump
is close
they were shocked to learn that given
all we know
the results are still close and I
thought wow I certainly agree with CNN
on this it is how are they going to
explain
that one of the candidates is
cognitively gone and has conclusively
been proven to be part of a criminal
Enterprise how in the world could he
still be polling as well as Trump who in
the fullness of time we could see was
one of the most effective presidents of
all time
and then I opened it it was they were
shocked that Trump is polling so well
I was like wait what
you're shocked that Trump is polling so
well
wouldn't a hundred percent of everything
we see suggest he should be polling two
to one against Biden
because one of them actually still works
like one of them still has a functioning
brain and everything and they were
shocked that the guy without a brain
wasn't doing better against the guy who
is one of the most effective presidents
of all time
and it was quite a mind Bender to enter
their little weird world where
everything's backwards and it just sort
of spends some time in the backwards
world
now in their world the fact that Trump
keeps getting indicted
should should be uh indication that how
in the world could they be voting for
this indicted guy and they're figuring
out that their their brainwashing you
know gaslighting operation only works on
their own team
the the main thing that people forget
is that the brainwashers aren't trying
to brainwash you
they're brainwashing their own side
that's the whole game just brainwash
their own side maybe get a few you know
gray area people to go over but they're
not trying to brainwash Republicans
the Republicans can see it clearly for
what it is
now the same is true on the Republican
side
the Republicans who are you know let's
say pushing their narrative they're not
really trying to convince any Democrats
they know that's Out Of Reach
all right
um
I'm tired of talking about how Bill
Maher uh is not woke
I guess we could just stipulate the Bill
Maher is a liberal who wishes it was
more like the old days
Deborah in all caps Scott got
brainwashed during covet Deborah you got
brainwashed by the people who told you
my opinions were the opposite of what
they were and then you believed them
so the all-caps shouting is kind of a
tell for brainwashing there
if you see me shouting in all caps then
that would be a tell
that you should say hey hey maybe
there's something wrong with you Scott
but if you're shouting me in me on all
caps based on the fact that you believed
a 4chan rumor or a comic strip about my
opinions
maybe you should go
look at that
all right
um
the uh I think we're looking at what
might be the new uh race hoax 2024 we've
been waiting for it but maybe it was all
it was there all along
so you saw there was that well-dressed
suspiciously well-dressed
group of alleged Nazis although I think
most were Nazis so that part is I don't
think that's too alleged
um that seems like a fact and they have
nice new flags and nice new shirts and
very very well organized and one of them
is this highly tattooed Guy full face
tattoo called bone face
and Bone face is known to have
gone to a fight for Ukraine for a while
but I think he I think he was so bad
they kicked him out of the Ukrainian
military yeah I don't know how bad you
have to be to get kicked out of the
Ukrainian military but
so that's what happened uh I think he
was kicked down anyway uh the I think
Rolling Stone is trying to get the hoax
moving because somebody yelled at him
that they were DeSantis supporters and
Bone face or one of them yelled back uh
we support DeSantis
and that's the part that Rolling Stone
decided to quote and make an article
about
so he used the statement we support
DeSantis
so he does right
because there was a guy
and he said there's words and they heard
it with their own they heard it with
their own ears
they saw it with their own eyes it's on
video so it must be true
right I mean I I don't know it could be
any counter argument is there any way to
imagine
that you could see it on video and yet
it wouldn't be true is there any way to
imagine such a such a wild thing
well
suppose they had given you the full
quote
do you know what the full quote was
we support we we support DeSantis hahaha
 this antis
that was the full quote I think I'm
paraphrasing but the first part was
sarcasm followed by their actual opinion
which is mocking people who thought they
supported DeSantis
they were actually mocking it the
opposite of what Rolling Stone reported
and they had the full video
they had the video now do you know what
a wrap up spear is
pretty soon you're going to see a
politician saying well there's DeSantis
is racist they said so
and people will say no no they didn't
and then what does the Democrat say
I can go Google it for yourself
just Google it you'll find out and if
you Googled it what do you think would
come up first
the debunking
or the Rolling Stone article with the
rhubarb fake
you know you already know that you don't
have to check right so that's how it
works you just need to get one entity to
say it's true you get your least let's
say at least honest entities to do that
who still have a national name
and then you act like it's true because
it was in the media
that's how the whole game is played
all right
there are what are the four least
reliable indicators of Truth in 2023.
there are four
indicators of truth that are the least
reliable what are they I will let I will
label them these are the least reliable
things your left ear
your right ear
your left eye
your right eye
right those four things do not trust
for forming opinions
because those are the easiest to fool do
you know why scientists are so easy to
fool
because they don't suspect the trick
that's why they're the easiest because
the scientists are thinking well I'll
look for a problem within the domain of
science
what about somebody just made up some
 they won't even you know what what
about a video that just got edited and
they didn't know that's a thing right as
soon as you get out of your scientific
domain you think things are supposed to
work the way things are supposed to work
you're completely lost because the world
the real world of news and propaganda is
nothing true at all
you know it's just all completely
ridiculous garbage
so
um yeah don't believe your eyes your
ears and the the dumbest people on
social media and you're seeing a lot of
them lately
are saying I saw it with my own eyes I
heard it with my own ears it was on tape
you know you must be lying because I
personally witnessed it those are those
people are so lost
it's the lowest standard of Truth as you
saw it
the lowest standard
um
so what else we got going here
it's a low news day
uh that's about it
[Laughter]
that's about it
so I'm still working on some plans to
figure out how to educate the youth I've
got another scheme which you're going to
see I think you'll see pretty soon I'm
working on some stuff
and
uh what about Maui
well what do you think is true about
Maui
do you think it's true that high energy
lasers from space started the fires
I put the odds of that at about zero
uh what do you think of the odds that
it's a conspiracy by the rich people so
they can buy the land up for cheap
I give the odds of that at zero zero
what are the odds you know I'll give you
know I'll give everything 0.001 because
you never know right but basically zero
um someone says Jewish space lasers
probably probably not probably zero
um how about
yeah because there's no other way to
start a grass fire yeah you know if
you're going to start a grass fire
the way to do it is with space based
assets
I'd like to start a fire
well I can't see any way to do that from
the ground
so perhaps if I shoot my laser against a
mirror in space yes yes yes that could
be it Archimedes kind of a focus light
kind of an idea set your sailboats on
fire yeah yep I know some history
and what else do you believe about Maui
do you believe that there wasn't enough
water because the the water worshiping
woke guy
I'd say the odds of that are pretty
close to zero
now some parts of that story might be
true but if you believe that if you
believe they let the island burn because
there was one guy who wouldn't release
oil or water on time
really
I mean just ask yourself does that sound
like a real thing that happened not to
me
to me the official story sounds better
that there was no point in releasing it
for the helicopter pickup because the
helicopters weren't flying because there
was too much wind
that sounds real
so I don't know about anything else but
that sounded real I don't know if it's
real but it sounds unreal the other one
doesn't sound real
uh
um
there's do you do you think it's real
that Hawaii did not properly attend to
fire management by getting rid of the
weeds
or by turning off the power
yes yeah normal incompetence explains
everything see here's a good rule
if you have two possibilities and one of
them is just people acting normal the
way they always do and one of them is an
extraordinary space laser
I can't say it's never the space laser
not never
but if you if you go with that operating
consumption well I think I think the
space laser is sounding good now you're
not going to be right very often go with
the most ordinary
see this is what bothers me with all the
anti-semites
the anti-summits have decided that
they're seeing a pattern which can only
be explained by a mass Jewish conspiracy
and that's why for example there's so
many people with Jewish last names who
are in the media
you can't think of any other reason that
there could be a lot of people in the
best jobs in the world
you can't think of any normal reason for
that
like if you went to the colleges of
America would you find that one
identifiable group is just killing it on
education
do you think you would find that
of course you would
of course you would
yeah and if if one group is just killing
it on education like they're really
getting that right what kind of jobs are
they likely to have
sort of blue collar you know
construction jobs
or or would they look for good jobs like
the kind that everybody would want you
know it would be a really good job
head of a media company
I'd like that job wouldn't you I mean if
you if you like that kind of thing
wouldn't you think those are the best
jobs
so so we're all going to be surprised
that the people who are definitely doing
the best in school
right
uh have have some results that would be
completely predictable based on having
the best academic
um
you know academic results then on top of
that
I can't speak speak for the Jewish
Community but are there a lot of Jewish
parents who are telling their kids that
they should work for the Post Office
because mine did
my father recommended I work at I grew
up to work for the post office because
he said the benefits were great
the overtime was the overtime pay was
excellent and the retirement was good
too it was good steady work and if you
work for the Post Office you'd always
have a job
yeah so my parents who are not Jewish
recommended I get a nice
nice low-end job and settle in on that
huh how about that
do you think Jewish a lot of Jewish
households are like you know you know
what you should really think of
you should really think of Plumbing have
you have you thought of Plumbing
no
they're probably saying you should be a
professional of some sort you know some
something that wears a suit or a doctor
outfit and you're gonna make something
of yourself you're going to be a writer
an executive or a finance Banker or a
lawyer
doctor scientist kind of thing so now
now compare your theory
if you're an anti-semite and you think
there's a giant conspiracy compare your
theory
now here are here are the things you
have to accept to accept your
um
Jewish conspiracy you'd have to accept
that for some reason
conservative Jews are not aware of the
conspiracy
how'd that happen
how is it the conservatives the one you
know ones that might be on the same side
of those of you who have conspiracy
theories why are the people on your same
side
not aware of the theory
you're not going to find anybody
now second
are in your view are the the part is the
Jewish conspiracy the best kept secret
ever
because I've worked my entire you know
professional career
I've always been around top successful
Jewish Executives Publishers agents
Talent
you know way way above the uh the
percentage that you'd imagine for most
kinds of careers because I'm in that
kind of a job right I have a good job
surrounded by people other people have
good jobs
why do I have a good job because I took
school really seriously
that's why I have a good job
I took it really seriously and so I work
with a whole bunch of other people
who took school really seriously
fortunately my mother didn't think I
should grow up and work in the post
office she was more of a be a lawyer
type
so do you think that I could spend
decades
working in and around Jewish
professionals and I wouldn't catch a
wish whiff of this bias which you all
see that's driving them towards some
kind of you know big conspiracy that I
would spend 30 years you know a lot of
my best friends
and then nobody would mention it like it
wouldn't even come up
and that and that I would notice not a
single case
not a single case in my entire career
where I even had a whiff
that anyone who was Jewish
was treating me in any way other than
you know what talent I brought to the
situation not a whiff
you don't think you don't think the eye
of all people
would be able to detect you know bias
and discrimination against me
you don't think I could detect that it's
all I talk about it's it's like 75
percent of everything I talk about is
you know some bias that affects me I've
never seen any
you can spend your whole life
working with the top Professionals in
the Jewish world you just would never
detect anything like that
is probably the most open-minded group
of people that I've associated with
that's my that's my experience so the
the anti-semites you're gonna have to
you're gonna have to figure out what's
wrong with your theory
because the ordinary theory of there's
just people who valued school so they do
well that's kind of the whole story
now if you say to me but but but they
also support Israel
I say well so do I so do a lot of people
you know is that some big surprise
like does that tell you something I mean
they're they're one of our strongest
allies yeah of course we support right
anyway
I just wanted to put that in there
uh do I purchase my coffee from Mike
Lindell
no I'm just keeping it easy
draw Starbucks
um
odds of a kraken
I don't know probably the same as ever
you know the the only thing that would
suggest there's going to be a kraken
is just that it feels like that would be
the right point in the movie for it to
happen but in terms of other evidence I
don't see it you know every day I read a
story about a new a new set of evidence
of election problems but they don't pan
out
so I've I haven't seen one that I'm
satisfied has turned into something real
but there might be I wouldn't rule it
out do not rule it out
Snoopy boobs is here just to say bad
things about me so we'll make you go
away you're here every day just to say
bad things about me
how sad your life must be
imagine waking up and saying oh I can't
wait to be a pain in the ass to one
person I don't know
what's the motivation of that
Scott has never mentioned the Sackler
family of course I have Chucky
and he's calling me a clown for never
mentioning of course I have of course I
don't care what happens to them
there's this type of troll oh by the way
there was some evidence of a vague
tweeted around something where there's
some evidence that the DeSantis group
are
behind every rumor you're hearing about
Vivek because they said they were
so there was actually on tape some
operative who who said it in his own
words everything they hear about Vivek
comes from us
so they're massively flooding with the
fake fake stories so all the stories you
hear about the wef and uh about his form
of business that's all fake stuff coming
from the DeSantis trolls
all fixed up you know what you know let
me
let me put out a principle for you
I don't know if Trump does that does
Trump do that
have you ever heard that there's a bunch
of trump trolls whose job it is to say
things that are not true
there might be
there might be but I'm not aware of them
but are they organized obviously Trolls
Exist that's not the question but are
they organized like allegedly this
Trump does it himself
I don't know I I feel like Trump
generally says things that he thinks are
true but he might add some hyperbole
I don't see him just making up
like you know it's hyperbole but it
doesn't look like just made out of
nothing
that does seem different
yeah he is directionally accurate
all right
and Al is saying that so Al who is
probably a DeSantis troll says Vivek
conspiracies are true DeSantis has no
marketing machine
does that sound like a real person would
say that
that doesn't even sound like a real
person does it
yeah well I would say this if I were a
Republican
uh I'm a registered Democrat but if I
were a Republican
and I knew that one of the people in the
primary on my team
was sending young people to make up
about
um one of the most productive people in
the party
Vivek I would never vote for that guy or
a woman
right I I disant this to me if it's true
that he has that there's an organized
group of people spreading rumors about
Vivek that are not true that's
disqualifying
you know even if it's a pack I don't
care he knows it if he knows it's
happening and he doesn't stop it
that's disqualified
attacking your own team at that level
acting acting like a Democrat that's
that's exactly it that would be acting
like a Democrat thinking that you could
win by
doesn't need any to win see
that's that's the sad thing all he had
to do is run a capable
um you know a capable Campaign which he
didn't do
but that should have been enough to be
you know the solid second choice in case
something happens with Trump and there's
a lot of danger of that
yeah who talks politics in person not
many I sure don't
let this guy that here's no Norm says
Vivek is an affirmative action candidate
he gets the easy treatment because he's
brown you know it's true Scott for one
loves Vivek and brown people
Norm I do love brown people
what what is your point
should I not
why can't I love brown people
I've always loved I've always loved
brown and black people
you know if you live in California
and you live in an um let's say an area
that's doing well
half of your neighbors are Indian
Americans
like they're they're they're awesome
people if you haven't partied with an
Indian American
you have not partied can anybody want to
back me up on that
if if you haven't been invited to a
party at an Indian American house you
haven't been to a good party yet
they they know how to have fun
amazing people
you know huge benefit to the country
probably one of the best things that's
happening to America is the is the
influence of Indian Americans
all right
uh he is easy treatment
somebody thinks that uh Jose gets easy
treatment on CNN
like what what reality are you watching
it's so funny
all right
all right I'll just look at your
comments here for a second
yeah I don't under I would love to have
a
some kind of personal conversations with
my trolls yeah wouldn't it be great if I
could just like transport the troll from
social media like just to sit next to me
and I would just say what the hell is
going on here
the first question would be are you
drunk
because you know at least half of them
just look drunk
but if they're not drunk I would say
what what exactly is the game here are
you just trying to get a little dopamine
hit or do you believe any of the things
you decide because because it doesn't
sound like things that anybody would
believe
and I did see that Nikki hilley was
second in polling after DeSantis
which would be third
um
I think she's got I think there's a big
I think there's a big desire in the
Republican party for a female candidate
when I say big desire Deborah
Deborah comes back imagining that she
heard something true about me
bye
goodbye Debra
I wonder if Deborah is a real woman
okay
now the the trolls it's always the same
three trolls if you think there are a
bunch of trolls on
on YouTube they're not it's the same
three they just change their names and
come back you could tell them you tell
the same ones
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
all you've got for this uh
Monday what is today Labor Day right
Labor Day in the United States
so if you're going into labor today
it's a perfect day for it I unlike many
of you will be working today
because I never rest
I never asked all right it's all
