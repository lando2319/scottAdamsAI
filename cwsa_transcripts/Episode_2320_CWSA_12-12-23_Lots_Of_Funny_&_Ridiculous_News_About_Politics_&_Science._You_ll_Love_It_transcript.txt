good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
doubt you'll ever have a better time in
your life than the time we're going to
spend here and if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels which even
your doctor can't understand all you
need is a copper muger glass A T A
tanker Cher d a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like go
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine head of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh that's so good savor it saor
it well if we have any technical
problems today it would be because um I
hear the rumble network has been under
some kind of persistent Cyber attack
so if we see any hiccups it might be
that persistent Cyber attack now I need
a I need somebody to tell me if I'm
insane because I feel like was it a day
and a half ago there was this giant
gigantic story in the news that China
had hacked into all of our major
infrastructure and they were waiting to
you know if things got bad they just
turned off the country and I said to
myself I don't believe that story did
anybody see me post on
X to to hold your hold your horses on
that story because I didn't believe
it it's gone the story is
gone I thought it was going to be like a
World War III cyber story completely
disappeared from the news what happened
I have no idea what happened you I can't
give you the answer to my own question
did it just disappear
I have a
hypothesis here's my
hypothesis there was something about
that story that didn't sit right and I
didn't know what it was and I thought it
might be what's left out so the story
was that uh we somehow we suddenly know
that China has access to critical
infrastructure via hackers and the idea
is if anything bad happened such as
conflict over Taiwan
uh Russia or China could just turn off
our
lights here's the first question how
would we have known that was
China are are there hackers so bad that
we can tell who's hacking us see that's
the thing I always wonder about how
could you be such a good hacker that you
could hack into the critical
infrastructure of the United States you
the the imagine the highest level of
technical
proficiency but you would leave a trail
Is that real I guess I don't know enough
about the field to understand do all
hackers always leave a
trail that doesn't feel right to
me I'm seeing some some people say yes
how could that possibly be there there's
no way the hackers have figured out how
to cover their tracks or redirect it
look so it looks like somebody
else
I'm skeptical all right here's the other
thing about that
story the part left out was how badly
has the United States already
infiltrated Chinese
systems isn't that the big question so
if you hear a story that hey China has
already infiltrated our systems they're
not doing anything bad yet but they
could at any minute doesn't that apply
to us and infiltrating their
systems cuz aren't we better at it I
mean I don't I don't know that that's
true but I've I've heard it said that
the US is some level above the other
countries in
hacking so do you think that maybe the
story went away because we would have
had to admit we're doing the same thing
maybe the story went away because wait
for it it's been true for 20
years what if it's been true for 20
years that China's been inside our
systems and could take down the country
anytime they
want what if it's true that everybody's
in everybody's systems and and we don't
know exactly who where or why but you
got a lot of countries trying to hack a
lot of other
countries wouldn't you expect that by
now all of our systems are
compromised all of the American systems
all of the Chinese systems all of the
British systems all of the French all of
the
Russians
now here's why oh uh somebody said stop
scaring me here's why you shouldn't be
scared there's no
difference if this sounds like I just
described a new thing that's a new risk
nope nope do you know why China won't
turn off all the lights in the United
States even if they
could the same reason they don't nuke us
it's mut mutually assured
destruction there there's a reason they
don't attack us
it's a bad
idea right so the most logical situation
is that everybody's getting ready to
attack but they don't plan to you know
it's just a mutually assured destruction
so it's possible that the story was
realish but not new and also completely
balanced by what we're doing to prepare
in the same way so it could be that the
intelligence people said hey just take
that story back we we don't don't like
that story out there it looks like some
kind of
coordinated um takeown by by the
government is that what you saw or was
it just never true maybe the story was
just never true and people were on to it
early I don't know to me to me it's a
big mystery why this gigantic story that
worried me for one evening is just
gone yeah little suspicious all
right in my second mment I call
backwards science backwards
science uh Mark Heyman MD it was uh
posting that scientists that looked at
the uh the health benefits of sonas and
they look at Finland where people have
been using sonas of various kinds for
many years so they could get a good base
for their study and they found that uh
those who use the sauna two to three
times a week had a 24% lower risk of
death wow and the hardcore users who
went four to seven times a week had a
40% reduction in death compared to those
who went for just one session in a week
so I guess that proves that saunas are
good for you am I
right it's proof the people who went to
the sonas the most were clearly
healthier than the
others what what that's not that's not
good enough for you but the evidence is
right here the people who go to the SAA
the most are the
healthiest while you skeptical doubters
you that I've trained you so well what
do you imagine there is that would be
different about people who have all the
time in the world to go to a
sauna do you know why I don't use my
sauna I have one I have a one of those
infrared dry Sona things and do you know
I have never used it never not even
once too
busy and too busy and doing stressful
things I'm too busy getting cancelled
and trying to save the world and doing
live strings streams and drawing
cancelled comics and stuff yeah I don't
have time for that do you know how
much healthier I would be if I had time
just even if I didn't do the sauna you
could take the sauna completely out of
the story
and you just said to me Scott you now
have time to spend an hour doing nothing
uh four times a
week I'd be like are you kidding me I've
got an hour to do nothing four times a
week I'll take it all right so I do
suspect that there is real science to
the fact that the usas are good for you
I think it's real if I if I had to bet
on it I'd say yeah it's probably real
but you have to watch out for this this
weird selection of the people they're
looking at they they always it's the
same problem with the wine right
remember they used to say wine was good
for you if you had uh if you had one
drink a night you're healthier and I
said um who what what is it about the
people who can have one drink a night
they have
money that's that's a good signal for
long life and they have
moderation they have the physical
ability to moderate things that you know
are hard to moderate if you just gave me
all the people who can moderate things
that are hard to moderate I'll show you
a long living group of people those are
people who have some some ability to do
the right stuff
anyway
um are you ready to have your brain just
blown right
off all right I've got a little uh
preview of a survey that was embargoed
so you weren't supposed to hear this
today but I guess uh Glenn Beck
mentioned it yesterday so it's unemaro
because somebody did it publicly all
right this is from raspon um raspon is
reporting it and
um see who did did they do the
survey I think they were working with uh
uh the Harland Institute on this one all
right so let me just I'm just going to
read it to you okay so this one
I don't want to I don't want to
summarize it I'm just going to read you
you know in the in the words of rasmuson
here um one in five mail in voters admit
they cheated in the 2020
election just let that soak in a little
bit this is based on a real current
survey one in five 20 that's 20% uh
mailin voters admit they cheated in the
2020
election you want some
details are we having fun yet are we
having fun here's some
details more than 20 more than 20% of
Voters who used mail in votes in 2020
admit they participated in at least one
form of election
fraud some of them participated in more
than one form so the 20% is a little bit
understated because some of them some of
them broke the law in two different
ways all right let me go on uh 21% of
likely us voters who voted by absentee
or mailin ballots in 2020 election say
they fill down a ballot in part or in
full on behalf of a friend or family
member such as spouse or child well 78%
say they didn't now depend you know
you'll find out later that depending on
the state that could be illegal so I
don't think that's illegal everywhere uh
30% of those who surveyed said they
voted by absentee or mailin bellot in
the 2020
election uh 19% of those who cast mailin
votes say a friend or family member
filled out their ballot in part or in
full 19% said somebody else filled out
their
ballot now again depends on the state
you know what is illegal and what's not
illegal is State dependent furthermore
177% of mail votes say that in the 2020
election they cast a ballot in the state
where they no longer were a permanent
resident let me read that one
again 177% of mailing voters said that
in 2020 they cast a ballot in a state
where they were no longer a permanent
resident now let's put this in
perspective these people were being
asked to confess a felony it's a felony
right is it is is election frud a felony
or just a federal is it just a federal
offense I don't know I don't know what
the right word is but can I ask you show
me in the in the
comments if somebody asked you if you
had broken a
law even if you thought that you were
going to be
anonymous would you answer that question
and say you had broken a law how many
how many of you would confess to
breaking a law to a stranger on the
phone I wouldn't and I don't recommend
it don't recommend it at
all um
but so do you think that the numbers are
understated do you think there's any
good chance that the number of people
who are doing these bad things were
illegal things may be far greater than
the number who are willing to admit it
to a stranger on the phone in a recorded
sense in a way that their identity could
absolutely totally be be
identified wow now we don't know um I
don't know based on this survey who
people voted for but I'm going to go out
in the limb and say that if you confess
to a felony to a stranger on a digital
device in a way that you could easily be
located if that were their
intention probably a
Democrat I'm just kidding I'm just
joking I kid the Democrats I am a
Democrat I'm a registered Democrat so I
can say that I can say that because I am
one
anyway uh all of these practices are
illegal Harland Institute officials
noted uh the results of this survey are
nothing short of stunning said Justin H
Haskins director of the blah blah blah
for the last three years Americans have
repeated been told that the 2020
election was the most secure in history
but if this poll's findings are
reflective of reality the exact opposite
is true this conclusion isn't based on
conspiracy theories or suspect evidence
but rather on the responses made by the
voters now there's an important question
that needs to be
asked what does the division between
Democrats and Republican look like on
this one and
Independence because that matters right
if it turned out that there were just as
many Republicans as Democrats and they
were voting at the same they were
cheating at the same rate and they all
voted absentee at the same
rate maybe it all comes out in the wash
but what is the ratio of Democrats
voting remotely you know by a mail and
ballot versus Republicans does anybody
know that ratio is it like 3 to1 or
something it like in the back of my it's
like 4 to1 or 3:1 right somewhere in
that neighborhood yeah people are saying
four to one and that that feels right in
my memory yeah so let's say that the
cheating level was the same you know
there's no evidence or at least I
haven't I haven't dug into the cross
tabs yet
but say it was the same wouldn't that
mean that there was a 4 to one
advantage to the Democrats in
cheating now here's the fun part
if you did the same survey or a variant
on the survey and you did it in a
Battleground state that Trump lost
narrowly and all you did is say all
right let's put the cheating into the
mix let's do the survey in just the
state so you get more representative for
the state you say to yourself what is
the percentage of of Democrats cheating
you have the percentage of Republicans
that say they cheated and then you just
do the math and you could determine
reasonably
scientifically if the election was fair
now I have to I have to give this a
little
caveat I'm not sure all this stuff
should be
illegal does anybody have a an objection
to that I don't think it's the
most inappropriate thing for somebody
else to fill out your
ballot if if somebody came to me and say
hey Scott do you care about politics and
I say no and and you say to me do you
mind if I fill out your ballot uh I'll
just put your name on it I'm going to
vote for whoever and let's say I don't
care I don't care one way or another and
I'm like sure yeah go ahead now that's
illegal right that's illegal should it
be should that be
illegal that's my vote if I if I want to
you say that should be illegal I say no
because that was my vote I I voted I
don't care and I also voted that I want
my brother or
whoever to have my
vote now now I I get that that's
technically illegal and I understand the
reason it's illegal I understand you
don't you don't have to sell me on the
logic of it I understand I'm just saying
that there might be there might be a lot
of these answers that are that category
that even if it's technically illegal
it's not going to be something you care
about I wouldn't care about it
honestly
so but you could uh pretty well find out
if the election of 2020 was rigged using
a variant on this methodology and here's
the funny part why did nobody think of
this before you you know why I would not
have thought of this to do an actual
survey cuz I never would have imagined
that anybody would answer
honestly it never would have occurred to
me that you could ask somebody if they
committed a
major uh you know illegal act and they
would say oh yeah oh yeah I was doing
some illegal acts yeah put my name down
there for illegal acts never would have
imagined it but apparently you can do it
all right here's uh as you know uh when
Biden runs against Trump he doesn't run
based on Trump's record
he scares you so first he did the fine
people hoax and sold that to half the
country and then he became President
Biden it but now that Biden has totally
 the bed in terms of his performance
and you know wideopen immigration and
crime in the cities and two Wars going
on that we think might be a little bit
optional um he can't really sell his
performance and he's not his bomic thing
wasn't working so you all know
no doubt about it that they're going to
be selling the scare tactic about Trump
right so it's going to be Trump is the
devil uh Trump will snap his fingers and
half of humanity will die why can't you
see how obvious it is that he's Thanos
re so you know that's going to be their
whole campaign re
re he's so
scary so here's uh what I going to say
it a 100 times mockery is the way
forward mockery is the way forward right
and I even have a name for it the
hilarious
hysteria so if you were going to put a
name on the Democrat uh strategy for
election it's the hilarious
hysteria strategy that they're get they
have to crank the hysteria up past
Hiller CU you know what it won't work
Hitler we're so we're so used to Hitler
now and and you know especially after we
saw
Hamas we saw the you atrocities it it
feels like the whole thing seems
ridiculous calling Trump pillar it just
seems
hilarious and so I would ask you to
treat it not seriously you should mock
it mock it mock it cuz it's not real
it's not based on you know anything it
it's literally Biden and the Democrats
hallucinating a hilarious
hysteria hilarious hysteria it's sticky
because hilarious and hysteria are a
little kind of close so just hold that
in your mind the hilarious hysteria
strategy see if you can make a
stick all right I saw a uh allegation
about Elizabeth Warren online that I
think is false but I'll put this out to
you um and V ramaswami commented on it
so that made it more newsworthy but
somebody posted the following which I
believe to be false so I'll ask for a
fact check on this right uh the claim
was that Elizabeth Warren's salary in
the Senate is 285,000 a year but she has
a $67 million net
worth now I asked I asked my Amazon
digital assistant what is Elizabeth
Warren's net worth and it told me eight
million 8
million
now 8 million you know would be enough
to raise an eyebrow it's
like how'd you get $8
million um but it's not outside the
realm of something she could have you
know invested plus the time she was
working privately you maybe you maybe
you get to 8 million but you can't
really get to 67
million you can't get to 67 million with
your
side with your side uh you know
Investments so can somebody do a fact
check on that I don't think it's
anywhere near 67 million that that
sounds like a lie what do you think oh
books yeah she had some books so yeah if
you had the books in
there I don't know what else they can
take money for they can't can they take
money for speaking engagement
when they're in Senate probably not
supposed
to they can they could take speaking
engagements for for pay are you serious
it's completely illegal for a senator to
get paid by a company for a speaking
engagement oh my God I just assumed that
wasn't I just assumed they didn't do it
or that it was at least against the
Senate rules wow all right well I I need
a fact check on that too but uh V says
it's a sign of
corruption and I'd say it very well
might
be but um I'd get a fact check on her
net worth I don't believe it all right
Trump is hilarious on Chris Christie I
love the fact that Trump is uh calling
chrisy
fat I don't know like Trump himself has
been the recipient of just the worst
body shaming you've ever seen you know
for years and years but but he still has
the uh the balls to make fun of Chris
Christie's physical fitness I mean that
that that takes you got to have a little
Huds spa or something to do that but he
does so he says on a truth post today
about Christie he's not fit for office
mentally or
physically he shows a picture of of them
which was unflattering he said we need
strong people not suffering from a harsh
terminal disease TDS Trump derangement
syndrome now I do like the fact that
Trump is hammering the Trump D
derangement
syndrome because that is the better way
to go than to go against each of the
individual accusations because the
accusations are crazy he's going to
become a dictator and blah blah blah
he's going to take your democracy away
I'm going to take your democracy way
Snap My Fingers half of you will die so
yeah let's mock that so Trump's on the
right he's following the right vein here
to to mock it for what it
is uh there's a viral video going around
with a bunch of young men saying that
they have no friends no one to call no
one cares about them they're basically
lonely and feel that nobody cares about
them I saw uh Mike cernich say they
should you know do something about it
for for example they could join a church
or join a cigar club you know basically
do something to go meet some people to
which uh I have a little bit of push
back I asked Mike on on the ax platform
do you have any others suggestions
besides church and smoking cigars I I
mean I I like where you're going on this
I I like the direction of it but I I
don't want to take up smoking or or
change my religion to make a friend you
have an easier way to do that pickle
ball there you go pickle ball um however
I think that the larger story no matter
what you do if you're a man uh I'm going
to go with Chris Rock's framing of this
Chris Rock Says and I paraphrase uh the
only people who get unconditional love
are women and dogs and if you're a man
you better provide value to somebody
because you will be evaluated on the
value you provide you don't get
automatic love like a dog or a woman and
I'm not comparing women to dogs don't do
that to me you know I'm not so I agree
with that completely and my my
recommendation besides joining a cigar
club or going to church would be why are
you
useless like why are you doing that why
are you doing nothing that anybody
wants why are you adding no value to the
world that's what I'd ask go add some
value right if if you had the kind of
job where you were killing it you don't
think you'd have some coworker
friends if if you were doing something
for the world or I know some charity
thing or whatever you don't think
there'd be plenty of people who found
you
valuable I think you would uh one of the
things I
accepted maybe in my 20s I realized that
all men are worthless
and that I was
one meaning what Chris Rock said we're
all worthless until we do
something and at first I thought well
that's terribly
unfair why is it that I'm only
worthwhile if I do something useful why
is that why can't I just be
valued but over time I said to myself
would you really want to change
places with somebody who's valued
without adding
value do you want to be valued just for
existing I'm not sure that that doesn't
feel that doesn't feel as male as it
should in other words I'm not
comfortable with it but I don't know if
I was just trained that way you know
maybe Society just trained me I got to
be useful or my parents or something but
I'm actually very comfortable with the
fact that I have no value
whatsoever unless I'm providing it in
the moment and I'll even go further I
don't think that any value I've provided
in the past should travel with
me I really don't I think if I'm not
doing something useful at the
moment you should judge me even if I did
something you liked last year if I'm not
doing anything
now why not I'm still healthy right now
if I were not
healthy then okay that's a different
standard right
but if I'm perfectly healthy and I had
decided just to retire because I can
right I have the resources I could just
not work every
day should I ask you to respect me if I
if I am perfectly healthy I'm perfectly
capable of contributing to the country
and I don't would you respect that I
hope not I wouldn't respect it in myself
so yeah men men have a different
standard but honestly it's one of the
things I like about being a
man I'm not complaining about that at
all I like the fact that I have to act
to create value that that gives me a
purpose a direction a very clear
statement of what needs to be done next
do something useful it's
easy all right representative Dean
Phillips who's running for president or
trying to get the Democratic nomination
against All Odds he says that the
potential impeachment inquiry to
President Biden could make him
unelectable yeah could make him
unelectable now I
think uh Dean Phillips is going out on
quite a limb here that there's something
that could make Joe Biden
unelectable I don't know about
that I have a suspicion that if Jill
Biden took Joe Biden to the taxidermy
shop had him
stuffed and took him
home he'd still win by two
points so I'm not really sure there's
anything that makes him disqualified I
mean if the fact that he doesn't have a
functional brain and is unlikely to sur
survive his term in office started two
Wars open the border and there's rampant
crime everywhere if that's not enough I
don't think the impeachment inquiry is
going to put it over the
edge right I see what saying cuz he's
running against him so you say that kind
of thing but no I don't think the
impeachment inquiry would make any
difference when you're running somebody
who may or may not have already been to
the
taxidermist right you can't tell by
looking at
him I don't know has he been to the
taxidermist yet or is that next
week I can't tell by looking at
him
so if you're listening and not watching
oh man did you miss a good imitation of
Joe
Biden yeah it was
great well I guess there's some new uh
uh legislation up that will take away
whatever rights we have left to privacy
and it would allow the government to use
you know any physical device in the
country to spy on anybody they want
basically so hotels libraries your
coffee shop Wi-Fi they they would all be
open to the government's uh being able
to intercept your
Communications now I thought they
already had that I'm seeing people raise
the alarm that oh this is a new level of
uh new level of looking into your life I
thought this was the old level are you
telling me there's something the
government couldn't get access to with a
warrant now some are saying that this is
warrant
less that the that the Patriot Act and
whatever this is is would be warrantless
so they could just listen in just
looking for something looking for a
terrorist or
something yeah I don't know this is a
little more technical than I understand
at the moment but I'm less concerned
about losing my privacy than most people
because I believe it I haven't had any
like I don't feel I lost anything
because I feel privacy went away a long
time ago the only thing the only thing
you have to keep you private is being
uninteresting
that's it the minute you're interesting
either because you're a politician or a
billionaire or you've done something
wrong and you become interesting well
then all your privacy is gone you don't
have a chance I mean there's going to be
whistleblowers and you're going to have
your accountants is going to take some
money to release your tax returns you
know all the stuff that happened to
Trump and now I guess prosecutor Jack
Smith has Trump's personal cell phone
and they're taking off all of his
locations like everything everything
he's ever done in his life that that the
phone tells you all of his
DMS does that seem fair to
you do you want to live in a country
where the government can take your phone
and without looking for something
specific would have access to just your
whole life everything you've said
everything you've
done well here I think is where
Trump is going to have the last
laugh because I don't know this for sure
but I believe Trump has had a decades
long policy of not putting dumb in
writing am I
right he he for for his entire working
career he's had a good practice of not
putting dumb in writing so I'll bet
they could look through his phone
forever and not find anything damning
I'll bet there's nothing there literally
nothing now one of the things I want to
do is find out where he was when he was
doing certain things I guess somehow
they think that'll help them maybe but I
doubt that will be the the difference
between prosecution and not all
right um there's a San Francisco
politician uh somebody on the uh what do
you call it Board of Supervisors who
says that the homeless crisis in San
Francisco is absolutely the result of
capitalism capitalism is the problem and
he's trying to cut the uh funding to the
police force to fix this problem caused
by
capitalism now this story is not funny
unless you see the picture of the
supervisor now who's a you know college
graduate a lawyer lawyer but I don't
have readily the picture with
me but why is it he looks so
dumb he he looks like he came from
Central
Casting he looks like a Central Casting
guy who uh like he looks like he was
cast for Dumb and Dumber like his actual
face looks like the dumbest face you've
ever seen in your life now I know he's
not dumb CU you know he's a lawyer so
you can't be dumb and be a lawyer
but why does he look so dumb is that
just my am I having just a uh a
subjective reaction because of what he
says this sounds dumb or does he
actually look dumb and he is dumb on
some level that allows you to pass the I
guess the lawyer board or whatever it
is I don't know so sort of an open
question have you seen the guy who's the
head of Hamas the the military head of
Hamas the guy who's still in God they
haven't got yet have you seen a picture
of that
guy that you just take one look at him
and you say okay I would not let you
babysit my children if you know what I
mean he looks exactly like who he is he
looks like the Prince of Darkness you
look at his face and you go holy I
would not want to see you in a dark
place meanwhile apparently the Biden
Administration is quietly building a
virtual wall on the border meaning uh
with high-tech surveillance towers and
whatnot so I think they got drones and
towers and listening devices and video
and
whatnot um that's not too unlike what
Trump was going to do do you remember
Trump's plan I think he said it directly
but he said we want a physical wall
where a physical wall makes sense and
where it's more you know doesn't make as
much sense financially you would do more
remote remote virtual stuff but that's
all you
need so is Biden just basically doing
exactly Trump's plan but acting like
he's
not because you can do the virtual stuff
and it's less noticeable so you could
actually be doing some serious things
that aren't quite complete yet uh but
Biden is also building the wall in
places where a wall makes sense he's
putting wall and places where a mall
doesn't make sense he's putting virtual
stuff I think that was exactly what
Trump was going to do like they might
have argued about which section should
be which but it's the same
plan you just isn't doing it fast enough
and of course the fact that we're just
letting people in like
crazy now here's the thing about the
border that I don't
understand the Republicans are treating
it like it's a border security problem
and you know it's not right
the the reason that people are coming in
you know as if there's no restrictions
whatsoever is not because we're
incapable of stopping them physically is
because they're coming in under a legal
umbrella meaning they can walk right up
to the front door say hey I'm applying
for Asylum and our laws say that we have
to treat it like it's real and then we
process them release them into the
country and say hey come back and we'll
check on you in a few years right so
we have we have a legislation policy
problem that we're treating it like it's
a board security problem there's no wall
that would stop
that there's no point in building a wall
if our policy is to leave the door open
and the policy is very much to leave the
door open to anybody who says
Asylum so why is it that the Republicans
don't frame it that way why are they
framing it like a physical uh border
problem is it because they can get more
political mileage out of it that way
because it looks it looks more stupid
the only thing I could think of is that
there must be too many Republicans who
favor keeping the Asylum rules the way
they are is that
possible why don't we hear every single
day that Matt Gates and I'll use Matt
Gates do you know I say Matt Gates
yeah because Thomas Massie Matt Gates um
Marjorie Taylor
green there there's like three
people who were doing work for us us the
American people there are only three
people doing work I don't even know what
the rest of them do how many how many
senators could you even
name what are they doing yeah Rand Paul
right Massie Rand Paul Thomas Massie um
Matt Gates you only hear hear about the
same half dozen everything well the rest
of them are just taking votes and
drinking martinis and sleeping with
their Mistresses and
stuff uh how can you support
Republicans when you're not aware of any
Republican who's pushing to change the
Asylum law n name me the name of the
Republican who's trying to change the
Asylum
law Rick Scott went by Mark Rubio went
by how hard are they trying
somebody said grassly but there there's
nobody whose name you can identify right
as like the one who's really out there
every day trying to change it remember
when Matt Gates tried to do anything he
was all over the news right when Matt
Gates wants to make news he's all over
the news on any point whatsoever but our
biggest problem is this stupid
Asylum and there's no name associated
with trying to change it nobody not one
person wants to put their name name out
there is I'm the one trying to change it
you know I'm going to die in this
hill there's there's something about am
I wrong that there's something about the
entire story that's not adding up it
doesn't add up that the Republicans are
not going after that Asylum thing with
100% enthusiasm it's like oh yeah I
heard Ted Cruz mentioned it once and I
feel like didn't Mark Rubio say
something about that once that's it that
that's that's the team that many of you
are supporting you're supporting the
team that doesn't even basically make a
squeak about the main thing they're
complaining
about and they act like they need a wall
can can you ask any of those
 how a wall is going to stop
people walking in through the Asylum
front door how how is that going to make
any difference all right we're not even
on the right topic most of the
time all right so you can't be happy
about about Republicans um yeah let me
say that as clearly as possible if you
think Democrats are the reason we don't
have border security you're not paying
attention you're not paying attention it
is
Republicans it has to be both or else it
wouldn't be you just wouldn't be there
it has to be both there's no other way I
can explain it now if you said that but
the Republicans aren't there every day
trying to change that Asylum thing then
I'd say oh oh I can okay that's a
Democrat problem because the Republicans
are really working on the right part of
this they've got leverage you know
they're going for the thing that makes a
difference but they're
not they're
not so how do you call this a Democrat
problem I know I I think the Republicans
could do a lot better on that at least
at least in the framing of it if not the
actual
result all right um
yeah no wall but we're going to keep
giving money to Ukraine to build their
wall as others have said so Hunter is
trying to get his gun charges uh removed
here his arguments are let's say um
partly that he should be immune under
the prior agreement that Observer said
was too lenient and then the judge threw
it out but he thinks that should still
protect them that's probably a weak
argument uh but he also says uh Second
Amendment he's going to make a second
amendment argument for why he should
have been allowed to have a gun even as
a an
addict what do you think of that weirdly
I'm very um sympathetic with Hunter
Biden on the gun
charges I'm very sympathetic because I'm
a second amendment person and if you
tell me that I can't have a gun because
somebody else said I'm an
addict I say no I have the right right
to be an addict and I have a right to
own a gun I have both
rights I'm sorry now it might be illegal
for me to buy a drug you know depending
on the drug that I get
that but I have the freedom to decide to
be a drug addict and I have the freedom
to own a gun you can't take either one
of those away from me so I'm weirdly on
Hunter's side on this I'm weirdly on his
side now I'm let me change it
I'm going to modify my statement I'm
100% on his side on the gun charge the
other stuff he's on his own but on the
gun charge no sorry he's he's almost
exactly the kind of guy who needs a gun
because he probably had legitimate
security interests I would
bet now is it dangerous is it dangerous
that drug addicts have guns yes
yes yes is it dangerous that any of one
of you have a gun yes yes it's dangerous
guns are dangerous that's why we have
them we have them because they're
dangerous that's the whole point of a
gun right so yeah I'm I'm I'm just going
to go completely on Hunter side on the
gun all right uh but but the law has to
do what the law has to do uh reading
scores in America apparently for reading
math and science
so all three have been declining a lot
in our schools from 2012 until now so 11
years of continuous nearly continuous
was a little blip but basically scores
going down for those years so I saw this
in a tweet in a post by chth uh
palaha palaha I hope I'm saying that
right he's one of the all-in
podcast um investor billionaire
guys and he he notes that there are some
reasonable guesses why you he notes them
he says on mobile phones social media
apps and gaming could be part of the
reason but he says his his best guess is
that social justice and wokeness that
degraded expelled Math and Science
Education in American schools because it
made some people feel
bad so he thinks it's basically lower
standards and and a change in
priorities could be
could be all of those things could be
all of those things a little
bit um but I'm going to add two more
possibilities number
one um you'd have to check the mix of
people because it seems to me um if if
you were to look at my local schools you
would and you compare them to 10 years
ago there would be a fire far higher
number of students who don't speak
English who are in the same class
how in the world do you compare that if
if the only thing that changed if the
only thing that changed was like my town
in my town the only thing that changed
was there are more non-english-speaking
people in the class that's it do you
think that the performance of that class
as an average is the same as it was 10
years ago it couldn't be there's not the
slightest chance it could be the same
even if every student did better and and
tried harder and the teachers were great
the average is going to be down so what
you would look for I'd look for things
like maybe um schools that don't have
any extra immigration you know any extra
non-english speakers I would look at
also the uh the
mix of how many people from low
income have been added to the mix is
there any difference there uh I would
look to also here's one that nobody
mentioned do you know how easy it is to
cheat in school now with
smartphones do you know what a kid does
to do homework
today I don't want to be the one to
break it to you but your child isn't
doing their
homework you know they're just looking
up online right and writing down the
answers even for
math what one of the things I learned
years ago helping helping kids with
homework you know there would be like a
math question or something and so I
would I would Google it and it turns out
the exact question is almost always
googleable the exact question so even an
exact math
question you can just Google the
answer yeah so how many kids do you
think go behind a closed door in their
bedroom and they've got two hours of
homework it's their entire night and
they have a choice of working hard and
trying to do it on their own and
learning something or they could just
look it up and be done in 20 minutes and
go play with their friends what are they
going to
do what are they going to do they're
going to do what any normal human would
do they're going to they're going to
cheat on their homework and then go play
with their friends and then when the
test comes they don't do so well because
they didn't do any homework now I think
homework is way overdone and it probably
should be closer to zero homework
because the the science doesn't really
support the homework working that much
but I've got a feeling that that the
smartphones are working during the tests
I think cheating is just more
advanced so there's there's a lot going
on there but basically it's all bad but
I would also add to this um kids are
getting less exercise that's bad for
your brain our food supply is poison
that's bad for your brain kids are
fatter and less active that's bad for
your brain and I'm going to add this
one when I was in
school I was told and I
believed that working hard and doing
well in school was largely a guarantee
of a good life almost a
guarantee most of you in my age range
would say the same if you stay them in
jail you know it wasn't drug addiction
wasn't a big thing back then or at least
we didn't talk about it um it was just
do well in
school and stay in a jail you're going
to be fine so I did well in school I
stayed in a jail did fine you know
plenty plenty of obstacles like
everybody has but if you've got that
going for you you know no no criminal
record and you build some skills you
you're fine now imagine you're a kid in
school today and you're looking at what
the real world looks like and then
you're looking at what they're teaching
you and you don't see any connection
between what they're teaching you and
what the real world requires or needs or
seems important and then you add robots
and Ai and you don't even know if you
grow up if you'll have a job you don't
even know if jobs will exist you don't
even know if the country will exist like
literally everything is up to who knows
how in the world
does a kid in this world say if I work
really hard today this will clearly lead
to my my good future because most of
them think they don't have a future they
don't think they'll be able to buy a
house you know live as well as their
parents so there's something broken
about the incentive system of school
then you add on the teachers unions
which are uh just a holy
mess so what's wrong with schools let me
tell you what's wrong with schools
everything
everything that's what's wrong the
reason we can't identify the reason is
because it's everything every single
part of the school experience is
degraded compared to what it used to be
every single part from the to the
lessons to the teachers to the
priorities to the smartphones to the bad
diets to the lack of exercise lack of
sunlight everything is worse
so yeah grades are going to go
down but Al also could be because
they're measuring it
wrong all right so here's here's your
perfect uh end of 2023 story we're all
following the story of the Three College
presidents uh upen Harvard and MIT who
did not give satisfying answers to
Congress about the uh uh verbal and
intimidating tactics of of some of the
protesters that were uh very bad news
for the Jewish students in those
colleges very intimidating and they were
asked you know does the does the college
allow that kind of thing and they were
well depends on the context and then
people said okay that's if you're going
to say it depends and you're not going
to say that it's completely off the
table then you must be fired so the
University of pen uh that President uh
stepped Down Under Pressure
uh but uh it looks like as of today the
president of Harvard is not going to
quit and has the backing of her
board so Harvard's going to stay strong
and then M MIT we haven't heard anything
from um but uh let me read you a little
post by Joel Pollock who makes the
following
observation that will be your perfect
2023 endcap
if if you want to know everything about
2023 it's going to be in this
one very tight
post by Joel poock you
ready it's hard to avoid a conversation
about bias when three academics said the
same thing on anti-Semitism but the only
one pen is the only one who isn't Jewish
MIT or black
Harvard could be just a coincidence but
it's hard to avoid observing that we
apply different
standards yeah of the three the only one
fired is the white woman who wasn't
Jewish now I understand I understand the
Jewish president because the issue
itself was about
anti-Semitism and nobody in the world
believes that a Jewish College president
is
anti-Semitic or or would support it in
any fashion whatsoever so that's one
where you can tell yourself
okay the the actual Jewish
president probably just had a bad day
right because there's no way that
internally you know and internally you
know that she would not uh put up with
anything like that but you know her
answer was pretty bad but as far as
Harvard yeah I think we see no
possibility that a black female Harvard
president would ever be uh forced to
resign but there's more on
that
um
so according to Bill Amman who's been
the major I guess the most notable
activist trying to get all three
presidents fired but especially Harvard
um he says that he's hearing from
reporters that part of the reason that
Harvard is deciding not to let their
president go
is because they don't want to Cave to
Bill
Amman and I thought damn it stop making
me agree with
you as soon as I heard that I thought to
myself damn
it I feel like I agree with
Harvard I feel like I agree with Harvard
cuz you know what is as bad as their
poor statements in
public having one guy decide who
their president is that's no good and
and his complaint by the way is their
speech not only their speech but the
speech on on the campus now I'm not I'm
not unaware that the real question is
the bullying and abuse not the speech I
get it right I get that those are
different but we're talking about a free
speech situation and you've got one
activist who's just really good at it
who who is going to cause maybe these
actions and Harvard is
saying we're not run by this one
activist and if you're going to force us
to do it we're going to do it we're
going to not do it just cuz you can't
force us to do it you know what I don't
hate that reasoning I'm not sure that's
the only reason of course I mean it's
more than that but I don't hate that
reasoning I don't think he should force
them to do something they don't want to
do you know even though I think they
should like I agree with Amman but I
don't like him forcing it yeah there
there is something to that push back
that I don't
hate here's some more push
back um you know uh
Jen uh weager who is running for
president on the Democrat side and he
gives this
advice he says can can everyone please
stop the dumb quote from The River To
The Sea chant it is is incredibly
hurtful to our Jewish brothers and
sisters it's also incredibly
counterproductive to protecting
Palestinians do not Chantel something
the majority thinks is a call for
genocide not
complicated do you
agree would you
agree that even if you understand that
it means something different to the
people are chanting it which is
questionable but even if you believe
that isn't the best adice that shut the
 up and stop doing it chance
something else right chance something
that's more on point that that the
people you're chanting to give them a
chance to say yes to it don't chant
something that we can't say yes to we
just can't say yes to that right so
what's the point of chanting it you're
just hurting yourself you're you're
you're turning yourself
into like genocidal looking crazy people
and then asking us to agree with you
how's that work that's not going to work
so you say to yourself well nobody's
going to push back against that opinion
I mean that's first of all you know Jen
it's a brave opinion he's you know uh
given that he's a Democrat so I give him
credit for the
opinion but there was some push back
didn't really see this coming and it's a
push back from a uh somebody who
identifies as Palestinian uh
aif um
Agra so uh aif responds to Jen and says
usually I agree with you Jen but as a
Palestinian I'd like I'd like you to
avoid tone policing us I'd like you to
avoid tone policing
us he says it's our slogan And We Can
chant it if we want to we could have
chanted anything and zionists would
still claim we were calling for their
genocide no
differently
this was the moment I
lost um all empathy for the
Palestinians I didn't want
to
but we we want to keep saying this
because it's our
chance okay so I'm going to say I'm
going to agree with aif it's your chant
and you do get to say it and Free Speech
you know there there's an argument that
if you're not bullying it's just words
and it's not different than other people
who said things like Boman right it's
not that different Glenn Greenwald makes
that argument better than I
do but uh if this is the way you want
it if if you want to be able to say that
chant knowing exactly how it's
received okay but don't ask for any help
and don't ask for any empathy cuz you
know what if you can't do this one
 little thing for me you can't do
this one little thing this one
thing you get
nothing you get
nothing right because the world doesn't
work like this the world doesn't work I
want to do whatever I want and you've
got to do what I want no the world
doesn't work like that you can do
anything you want but don't expect me to
give a about you if that's your
attitude right if you're not going to
play a little
bit you know with us us being
everybody then no I don't care so
honestly I can feel my empathy just
drain out of my body because I don't
believe this is an individual Rogue
opinion I'll bet you that if you talk to
the people who are doing the chanting
they would say the same thing they'd
probably say don't police our tone we
want to chant this we are completely
aware of How It's received and we want
to do it to which I say Free Speech also
don't ask us for a penny for
rebuilding don't ask us to tell Israel
to to do a ceas fire don't ask us to put
any pressure on Israel in any way
because you just wrote your own
ticket if your ticket is antisocial by
Design it's meant to be antisocial cuz
when I say social I mean you you give
some you put some weight on what other
people think about the situation that's
what social means right you're giving
them some weight to their opinion if you
give no weight to the other side's
opinion even such a simple valid
statement like this that it causes
things to get
worse you get nothing you get
nothing so good job
aif uh wow to the extent that I imagine
this is a generalizable feeling and I
suspect it is I suspect this is a
generalizable
opinion that's where we are so in a
weird way both sides are getting what
they
want do you understand that Israel is
getting What It Wants in the sense that
it's having its way with Hamas and Gaza
at the
moment but the Palestinians are also
getting what they
want because they want the complaint
more than the
solution there's no indication they want
a solution and there never has been
there's something about the importance
of the
complaint that is sticky in a way that
are that my Western mind doesn't
understand like I don't understand why
you would keep slapping yourself in the
face and then complaining about getting
slapped in the face you got to do a
little bit of something on your own a
little bit
I just don't see
it all right um James O'Keefe has the
goods on IBM I guess there's a video
they got in which the CEO of IBM is
saying directly that if they don't
discriminate against white people in
their hiring that they lose their
bonuses now that's being uh touted as a
a big
story that IBM is is a the CEO will
punish his
managers if they don't increase their
hiring of especially black
candidates now and he says directly also
that Asians don't count because they're
not
underrepresented so so he's basically
telling his people directly to disfavor
hiring white and Asians and favor uh
Hispanics and black and that they will
lose their bonuses if they don't
discriminate in that way
now people were reacting to that story
like it's something about uh
IBM that's not about
IBM that's every corporation in America
for the last 40
years every corporation in America for
the last 40 years
identical there is nothing about IBM
that's
unusual that there's a video so they you
know you have that but but that is the
conversation in every
boardroom
everywhere and people are just figuring
this
out I've been I've been you know for the
first 30 years of my career I didn't say
anything about it either because you you
know you would be ostracized if you
mention it but now I can because you
know X is a free speech platform and
live stream apparently I can say it I
haven't been canceled
yet so yes um every major American
company everyone everyone has
overtly discriminated against white
people and they continue to do it
now and and and by the way this has
never been hidden the the fact that
we're treating it like it's a there's a
whistleblower and there's an undercover
investigation and we got it we got a
hold of this video is completely
misleading so my problem with this story
is that you're going to get the
impression it's an IBM problem it's not
an IBM problem in fact I don't have any
special bad feeling about IBM from this
story
whatsoever do you think the CEO could
have kept his
job if he had not pushed this direction
the answer is
no everybody is operating under their
self-interest
and you know there there's the CEO was
literally telling people not to hire
people like
him that that's how weird it is because
presumably indian-americans are not
underrepresented in tech jobs and he's
he seems to have Indian um Heritage
so yeah this is a universal practice and
black Americans are just finding out
imagine if you're a black American and
you're just finding out this year that
for 40 years there's been massive
discrimination in your favor massive
every big company all the time all the
time 40 years you didn't know about
it that's why I keep saying that the
real solution here is not racism and you
know working on Equity
directly all you have to do is teach
children how to be
successful and then this all goes away
way all
right um let's see the hoodie
Rebels uh hit a Norwegian flag tanker so
they s a missile at a tanker and it's in
a key part of the uh there's a choke
point there in the Middle East so I
don't know what all this means except I
saw the amuse account
amuse uh reminding us that Biden removed
the hoodies from the Terror list so that
the Iran and the us could uh funnel a
billion dollars to the terror group just
St after taking office so the accusation
here is that Biden went easy on the
hoodies and uh they got a bunch of money
and then they used some of it to send a
missile into a Norwegian tanker in the
streets
so there might be a lot more to that
story that we don't know but uh Iran is
certainly getting
busy
so did I miss any
stories you
what
um yeah we talked about fared Zakaria
slamming the colleges for being
racists I think we got all the big
stories today
yeah the the point about IBM yeah just
to uh complete the circle thank you yeah
the reason IBM was targeted for their
discrimination practices is because they
decided they would not advertise on the
xplatform because X was associating
their ads with bad content but turns out
they're a racist
organization uh so yeah uh that's reason
the reason I'm not picking on IBM
completely is that they are sort of
victims of public opinion you know IBM
could Buck the trend but they're not
it's not like Elon musos who owns
Twitter so he has the freedom to do what
he thinks is right and hope it works out
in the long run if you're if you're a
public company you don't don't really
have that kind of Freedom so there's a
reason that they get forced into
becoming R IST organizations they're
forced by the
public
um
what did anybody leave X because Alex
Jones came
back um I doubt
it has there been any word about whether
Democrats have
left
X I haven't heard any statistics on that
my understanding is that traffic and
eyeballs are
up but I don't know if there's any you
know net change in the
mix yeah hey guys on YouTube you can
ignore Henry Cruz he's a
trouble
yeah you don't have to respond to him
like you serious he's the all capital
there there's one guy who just yells at
me and all caps the entire show
but he doesn't look serious he looks
possibly drunk or maybe has some mental
capacity
issues even Scott lives in a small
bubble would I ever deny
that the the bubble is a universal
problem we we don't have a way of not
being in a bubble the best you can do is
continually police yourself you know and
pop your Bubbles as they happen but you
can't really not be in a bubble
we just don't live in that
World um 1666 no I haven't read
that uh what about the story on Turkish
mpu got a heart attack seconds after
criticizing Israel I don't know about
that
story Scott would you join Tucker
Carlson's Network I don't think he has a
network does
he I thought he just had a show that was
just going to be him
is Tucker going to have oh he's going to
have other
content
oh oh that's interesting so you're
telling me that Tucker Tucker TV will
have more than
one Creator on it interesting where do
you think Tucker is going to get his
talent
from Megan Kelly is part of
it did that did that really
happen oh
that's
interesting yeah because I was wondering
who is independent who would do that
because the the people who are big names
already have big salaries so yeah I
don't think you're going to get the
daily wire people to move because
they're doing fine I don't think you're
going to get anybody who's happy on Fox
to move because they're doing
fine
well does it seem like I would be a
perfect person for the talker Carlson
Network what do you
think would I be a good
fit you know there's a there's a plus
and the minus there I suspect I already
have almost zero well let me ask you um
is there anybody who identifies as
Democrat or Le of Center who is watching
this live stream right now so identify
yourself if you're a Democrat or left of
center because Al Bet is
none
me yeah I see one yes another yes
yes but are you Democrats and also left
of
center or are you like right in the
middle de Democrats cuz I don't think I
have any like super Progressive antifa
BLM people
watching middle middle middle
yeah so I've got a scattering so it
doesn't it doesn't look like it would
change my U mix of people who see my
material it wouldn't change my
mix but I I hate being um I would hate
being siloed in a way that made it
harder for somebody to see it so that
would be a tough
decision but I also don't think I want
to have a professional professionally
produced
show I'd probably have to increase my
quality to be on anybody else's
Network I'm very much addicted to not
increasing the quality of what I'm doing
Loos in production quality I will
actually when uh when Rumble studio is
up I'll be able to do things like
chirons I'm going to make a promise to
you you know what the chirons are right
the little words that are in the bottom
of the screen when a news person is
talking I will have the funniest
chirons that's right my chirons will be
funnier than your
chirons so as soon as I get that going I
will do that but that's just for
fun uh best
reframe is Jesus
okay AI is already showing signs of
being lazy yeah you know I might be a
contrarian on AI but it seems to me that
the current version of AI is trending
toward more useless and not more
useful does anybody else feel
that because I'm hearing things like the
super prompts no longer
work for the newer models now if you're
super prompts and stop
working the the quality of AI you know
going forward is way degraded because
that means you don't know if the
question you're asking will get you the
right response the other thing we see is
it it's very insistent on sometimes
giving you fake
news it's very consistent about that and
it doesn't look like that can be fixed
because wherever that's coming from you
know whatever it causes it to lie to you
or to give you two different answers in
two different questions you can ask the
same question twice and get a different
answer so if it can't give you something
you would regard as accurate or
reliable it can't give you any opinions
so the two things they can't give you is
a fact you would
believe or an
opinion so no opinions and no facts
what's
left no opinion and no
facts there's nothing left you can't
even determine if it searched well yeah
so here here's what completely made me
lose it when I asked it to tell me the
news stories in the last s years in
which the government has lost or
destroyed or or in any other way made
unavailable some important records
digital email Etc it just couldn't do it
it just couldn't do it and that wasn't
really a hard
request it was basically a search you
know Google search but I wanted to not
have to do a Google search on every term
and try to remember the story and look
forward and everything I thought well
they'll pop right up with AI but they
didn't in fact its list of that stuff
was
completely tet so honestly I haven't
found anything to use it for and I'm
going to go further I can't imagine I
will now I know I know what everybody's
going to say but Scott you're looking at
their early version don't you see that
it's obvious that the problems you're
talking about will obviously be solved
by the newer versions to which I say I
used to think that but what I'm
observing at the moment suggest there
might be a wall there might be a cap and
I'm going to go would you like to hear a
provocative uh here's my
provocative
prediction AI will never be anything but
a
curiosity meaning you might have fun
talking to it for 5
seconds but it won't be interesting
beyond that it won't be able to tell you
what's true CU you won't trust it just
won't trust it and it won't be able to
give you an opinion because it's
designed not to and it won't be able to
tell you anything interesting because
it's designed to avoid those topics
because interesting means provocative it
means people disagree if the only thing
your AI is going to say is people
disagree has no value do you know how
many times I've asked AI a question and
all it does is say well people disagree
on
this that's not what I ask you I didn't
ask you if people disagree
you're not helping at all so honestly I
don't see any value in AI
whatsoever is is that the most
provocative uh prediction you've heard
on
AI I don't see any value to it
ever
now dumb take
right now if you had asked me even one
week ago
I would have said what you just said
that's pretty dumb like you'd have to be
the dumbest person who had never lived
in the real world to know that things
start you know things start as low
quality and then they rapidly improve
and then say look at look at the rate of
improvement AI went from sketchy to what
it is now really quickly so therefore
it'll keep doing that
right
nope
now I I believe that AI will never be um
indistinguishable from a human and it
will never be able to handle
any
uh any service question that's
complicated so I thought I thought AI
would be much better at solving customer
service problems that I'd be able to say
oh I've got this we weird problem and
then AI would say no problem you know
unlike a human who would have to check
with his supervisor and do research and
get the wrong answer anyway I thought
well the AI is just going to like solve
all my customer service questions
wouldn't that be great no the AI will
never understand what you want well
enough to some to give you the answer
and if it did it wouldn't have the
authority to do it and they would try to
talk you out of it it's just going to be
paid in the ass
so now let me test
it in the last 24
hours how many of you did something with
AI that was more impressive than a
Google search that organized some stuff
for you how many used AI in the last 24
hours to do something legitimate that
you couldn't really easily do in another
way and I'm not counting coding forget
coding because I'll give you coding yeah
if you're programming it's useful
definitely so outside of coding
so you've used AI for something
useful get give me some
examples give me an example just like in
one sentence copy
editing math
problems just
coding um Etsy business creating art
I'll give you all those things I'll give
you all of those
things yeah so what good is
summarizing so here's what it's good for
summarizing um
coding creating art that you didn't have
to create
yourself um it's a it's a better version
of search sometimes but not all the
time and I don't think it'll ever be all
the
time analytics how' you use it for
analytics I think it's useless for
Analytics
all right so I used it for uh one
purpose which is I I built a little app
GPT app whatever they call it and uh it
can find me a specific dillberg comic by
a keyword so it's proprietary I'm the
only one who has it um that was good
that's pretty cool but I also could have
done that another way right there
there's another way to do it could have
done it with just a search
so basically I told AI to search a a
text
file that has you know some information
about what each of the comics is about
but I could have just opened that file
and done a
search it really didn't buy me that
much so I will give you coding is easier
I'll give you some some copy editing
check your grammar none of those are
important they're just like minor minor
benefits so I'm I'm I'm going to stick
with my prediction that AI will be a big
disappointment and I'm going to go
further AGI will never
happen AGI is the level above this
that's like a a generalized intelligence
definitely you'll get AI to win a chess
it'll be good at math maybe you'll be a
better interface for dealing with some
of your some of your data but not much
not much
else not much
else uh the the best thing about AI is
voice
recognition would you
agree the the voice recognition of AI is
insanely good like that's Parts good
because I hate to talk to SI I that name
I won't say because it never understands
what I have to say well how often do you
talk to your phone if you do it all and
it actually understands what you said if
it's not weather or
time or Saturn
alarm usually it doesn't understand what
I say right doesn't understand my name
but AI does AI gets it right every time
all right that's all I got for now
contrarian stuff and I'm going to go do
some other work and you're going to have
an awesome day thanks for joining
everybody here on YouTube you're awesome
