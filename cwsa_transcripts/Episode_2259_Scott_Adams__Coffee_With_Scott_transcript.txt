good morning everybody and welcome to
cwsa yeah that's right I believe I am
now established enough that I can change
the name of coffee withscott Adams to
cwsa and some of you will say oh I kind
of know what that is so if you'd like
your
cwsa experience to go to levels that
nobody even imagined were possible well
all you need for that is a cup or muger
a glass of tanker chel Stein a canteen
jug or flas vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous SI
and it happens right now
go
well should I start with some non
horrible news and kind
of kind of work our way into it sorry
I'm laughing in a me and I say going
by yes we shall all right uh news number
one researchers have suggested that
caffeine as in coffee can also make your
orgasms more intense and ramp up sex
drive everybody back to your coffee
science is now confirmed your orgasms
will be stronger and your sex drive more
intense if you have some more caffeine
who's with me
yay oh
oh oh oh wait they didn't say the coffee
could finish you right
was more of a preparation thing I was
really hoping it would finish me but no
happy ending just caffeine but that's
okay too maybe science can find a way I
can get the job done well in the most
important news of the whole day we find
out today that Will Smith and Jada
pinkin had been separated since
2016 oh
no they had been separated since
2016 not legally but I guess they agreed
to be separated live different lives and
that would mean that when Will Smith
slapped Chris Rock it was over his
ex-wife at least not legally but
technically and then we find out oh Jada
pinkin Smith you you're telling all now
she's got a book out I guess and uh she
says that at one point in in the past
well before the
slapping uh Chris Rock had called Jada
pinket and asked run a
date believing that she was single but
she said she was not or something and
then he apologized that was it he just
asked around thinking she was available
but she was
not now may I make a
suggestion Chris Rock You Took the
punch and you didn't fight back that's
okay that's not a problem I think that
given the circumstances of where you
were not fighting back was probably the
right
play however I think you should
reconsider uh dating uh Jada pink and
Smith because now that you know she is
available I mean why not I'd like to see
Chris
Rock um have a little coffee you a
little coffee date
you see where I'm heading with this yeah
drink a little coffee and get your
ultimate revenge on Will Smith um
because I can't imagine better sex than
being Chris Rock drinking a little
coffee getting busy with the ex-wife of
the guy who slapped me I don't know
that's just me that's just me but I
think I might take another run at it all
right uh according to an AI
expert the GU now has an IQ equivalent
of
155
155 how does that compare well Einstein
had an IQ of only
160 160 uh my IQ 185 so it's it's still
30 points away from my IQ but it's
closing in on Einstein it's very close
to
Einstein now I would like to uh make a
huge
advance in the AI uh industry do you
think I can do that I'm going to make a
suggestion right now that will
change
Ai and really by the way this is serious
in the next 60 seconds I'm going to
change all of your experiences with AI
you
ready hey AI
researchers do you think you could stop
making your AI talk in a monitor like
this hello my name is AI I am talking to
you in a completely patterned way which
is easily recognized as an
AI how about you just have it talk like
people do do you know what people do
sometimes I talk fast like this because
they know what they're going to say
sometimes I take a little time to um to
think to think what the next word would
be now I know AI does not need have time
to think because it already knows what
it's going to say but if you're going to
try to act like a
person try to act like a person how hard
would it be to write the code that adds
variety to the way they talk five
minutes five minutes to make it talk
like a human I can do
it I'm not I'm not a uh programmer at
the moment I was a programmer in my
early
days but is a f minute task just tell it
to randomly punch a word we learned that
that's what newscasters do they randomly
punch words watch so I'll read this same
thing that the headline is I'll read it
like an AI
um see AI has an IQ of 155 now very much
like Einstein you can
just hit any word in
there AI now has an IQ almost like
Einstein right just randomly hit a few
words it doesn't even matter which ones
that's what we learned news casters do
so there it is I've changed the
entire the entire understanding of AI
talking am I
wrong that that would completely change
your experience of talking to AI if it's
simply talked in a more uh you less
pattern way it wouldn't be
hard at the same time and related in
ways which you have not quite
understood okay I take that back I have
the smartest audience in the entire
world many of you are engineers and you
do know exactly the importance of this
next story uh allegedly and I guess I
got to put the allegedly on there
Chinese scientists uh have built a a
quantum computer that solved that they
gave this really complicated math
problem problem and it solved it uh
within a millionth of a second now how
does that compare to to the best
supercomputers we had that are not
Quantum well the best so so solve this
problem in a millionth of a second the
best supercomputers would have taken uh
almost 20 minutes no not 20 minutes it
would have taken almost uh 20 day not 20
days uh it would take 20,000 years it
would have taken a 20 no it wasn't
20,000 years 20 million years it would
have taken our best supercomputer 20 M
sorry it wasn't million billion it would
have taken our best existing
supercomputers 20 billion
years to solve the
problem 20 billion
years and this quantum computer did it
in a millionth of a second
so now we're probably not really close
to being able to build a practical
quantum computer but this is really
lighting the way I mean you can see
where it's
going now I ask you smartest audience in
the world what do you get if you combine
AI with robots like the Tesla robot that
have fully articulated
everything and uh Quantum Computing
let's say the the AI is driven by a
quantum computer what do you get
then well you get some kind of super
creature that will eliminate all of
us so there's that because it will be a
superior species and when I say Superior
I don't mean just a little bit I don't
mean comparing say a human to a porpus
no no I don't mean comparing a human to
a cat
or a
beaver or a squirrel or an insect or a
fish it' be more like comp comparing a
human to um I don't know a rock or
something so no we're not going to do
well with h Quantum computer-driven AI
robots they might have a little bit of
an advantage to us there is one thing
you can do though to get back your
advantage before the robots take over
do I have to tell you or is it obvious
drink a lot of
coffee so that your sex drive goes crazy
so you can reproduce faster than they
can well faster than they can haunt you
down and kill
you that's your only hope coffee well
there's still the uh search for the
speaker of the
house uh representative Nancy
ma who is kind of awesome and follows me
so I like her better cuz she follows me
on
um she says she plans to vote for Jim
Jordan on the floor but why why does she
not want um Steve scales who's the other
person who's being nominated why why
doesn't she like him well one thing she
says is that she personally cannot in
good conscious vote for someone who
attended a white supremacist conference
and compared himself to David
Duke that's what she says of Steve
scalise that he attended a white
supremacist conference where he spoke
and compared himself to David Duke now
have I yeah have I taught you enough
about the
news that you know this is not true you
all know that right do I need to give
you the research do I need to bother
debunking it with the very next you know
message on X no of course that never
happened was there something that did
happen that some somebody misinterpreted
as being that thing yes yes there was
once something he he once gave a speech
at a different group that used the same
conference room but it was a an event
prior to this white supremacist group so
he he had no idea that there was any
white supremacist even going to be in
the
room now so that's the part debunking
the you know attended white supremacist
conference but what about the accusation
that he compared himself to David Duke
let me give you another uh fake
news
tip here's the word
compared whenever you see an accusation
to somebody compared to things that's
never
true let me just say it completely it's
never
true usually what happens is somebody
has made some reference
that in some very narrow
way there there's some kind of
comparison I don't know what this one
was but as soon as you see the word
compared it's very much like seeing
anonymous
source if you see anonymous source just
walk away it's not real if you see
somebody compared somebody to something
bad almost certainly didn't happen you
don't even have to research it right uh
do you know how many times that I've
been the subject of Scandal because
somebody said I compared two
things a few
times yeah this is this is why I know
that word is is a total tell for
 yeah so now Steve sciss never
compared himself to David Duke in a way
that you would care
about did he ever say now I'm just
making this part up but imagine if he
once said uh I'm getting I'm getting
more hate than David
Duke now I'm not saying he said that I'm
just telling you how this word compared
is used suppose he said I'm getting more
hate than David Duke would he not be
comparing himself to David Duke but the
context is David Duke is a bad
person if you leave that part out that
changes
everything right he may I have no idea
what he ever said and I'm not going to
research it because says this is the tip
doesn't matter who it is you know that
your side the other side doesn't matter
who if somebody says they compared
something that is never ever true just
know that and then you'll be
fine so I love I love Nancy mace but she
seems to have a preference here for uh
speaker of the house all right uh
tomorrow has been Friday Friday the
13th uh Hamas is called for a global day
of jihad in which all the jihadists in
every country everywhere would March in
the
streets and uh who knows what
else because when you say Jihad you
don't know exactly how everybody's going
to be interpreting that right I do think
that
there's there's a nonviolent
interpretation but there's of course a
violent interpretation and depending who
you're talking to and what they want you
to think they might tell you which of
those interpretations they're using but
the fact that it can be interpreted both
ways is a sort of
a scary
thing so I would advise you not to go to
a
city and
uh you might want to get the away
from them so if you see a gigantic uh
rally in support of Hamas my
recommendation is get as far away as you
can now I want to be very clear I'm not
making any kind of comment about the
genetic
nature of the supporters of Hamas has
nothing to do with anything I'm not
making any comment about
culture because there you know zillions
of Islamic people who would disagree
with Hamas Hamas so it's not culture
it's not genes because the Islamic world
is all over the place but what it is is
there's a let's say a
uh a a mental virus a psychological
virus so this group of people have been
propagandized to hate other groups of
people not because they have bad genes
and not because they have bad culture
but this specific training is very uh
damaging and risky so whenever you have
a situation where you can identify that
a group of people has been trained by
Society or their leaders or
propagandized in some way to think that
you're the enemy and that you're the
oppressor you should get the away
from them like actually stay away from
that group they would be dangerous to
you because they've been trained to be
dangerous now if you were the Washington
Post you would cancel me for what I just
said of course I said it a little more
carefully this
time but uh let's talk about that border
wall rasmon did a uh
did a poll now in the context of
watching Hamas having recently attacked
Israel and now the reverse
happening um how many people do you
think would now favor a border
wall no favor of border
wall uh 73% of likely us voters approve
of the decision to allow more Bard wall
Construction 73%
so that's about 73% that's about
34s
yeah
um and how
many so that would leave around uh about
one quarter about one quarter who don't
think a border wall is a good idea about
one quarter very
consistent that's right Israel Israelis
were being slaughtered because they
didn't have the border security that
they needed
and uh the same kinds of people are
coming over you know mixed in with the
good people are coming over
but um a quarter of our citizens say ah
ah I don't see the problem here and then
uh then rason asked uh V if they agreed
that the Biden administration's decision
about the wall to build more of it
proves Trump was right oh oh my
God h how many people would think that
uh that it doesn't I mean how how how
could you possibly
say how can you possibly see Biden
adopting you know a key part of Trump's
proposal not the whole wall it's just a
portion of the wall but still it's a
wall uh turns out that the number of
people who strongly disagree that Biden
doing what Trump recommended is a is
some kind of a support for what Trump
recommended how many people would think
that consciously doing what Trump
recommended was not an endorsement of
what Trump
recommended about
25% yeah about a
quarter thought that doing what Trump
recommended is not an endorsement of
what Trump
recommended least say consider
system well here's some tragic news
before we talk about Israel which is
more tragic but uh amazingly The
Washington Post which is owned by Jeff
Bezos um they had what is reported to be
significant drops in their readership
and subscription base recently wow so so
much so that they had to lay off 10% of
their staff it looks like they're on
track to lose according to the New York
Times They said in July the Washington
Post was on track to lose $100 million
per
year they're going to lose a hundred
million do per year I mean they've been
losing money
for why would Jeff
Bezos agreed to lose a hundred million
per
year when he could just close
it well it's not for economics is it
do you think that Jeff Bezos thought you
know what it would be a good idea to own
a
newspaper do you think Jeff Bezos at any
point said to himself a newspaper would
be a good idea I'd like to own one of
those that could be a good investment
it's going to make me look like a genius
of business I'll tell you
that well of course as you know this The
Washington Post is often uh
allegedly an outlet that our CIA uses
for their own uh their own
propaganda and um coincidentally or
maybe not coincidentally the CIA did a
major deal putting billions of dollars
of their of their work onto
Amazon's servers
AWS so everything in the world is
connected and so Jeff Bezos is making a
fortune from the government the US
government at the same time
he's subsidizing very expensively
subsidizing a newspaper which some say
the government requires to propagandize
you so I don't know what the real story
is but those are the allegations and the
connections and people say it's all
that but when I look at how much money
The Washington Post has lost uh probably
especially since the beginning of this
year I say what has changed I mean has
anything changed
well they did lose their best
cartoonist that probably didn't help
them at all and uh Phil bump did go on a
podcast one of the most famous writers
uh he's an opinion guy I think it's hard
to tell and uh he proved to the world
that uh he's not even attempting to
write real
news now that's my opinion of course to
me it appears that he he he as good as
admitted that their writing is
and the newspaper is not
real that was my interpretation totally
subjective all right so uh I'm pretty
glad I'm not part of a Dying industry
anymore I'll tell you getting kicked out
of the newspaper
Club the the people who think I felt bad
about that oh my god do I feel free you
know not not only that I have you know
my uh U my full uh Freedom
back but that I'm not part of something
that's just embarrassing at this point
newspapers are just
embarrassing it is bad enough to be part
of the let me put it this way if you see
the entire news industry as fake which
it mostly is let's say 90% fake and the
political
stuff um the newspapers are the lowest
rank of a disreputable group so you're
already part of a disreputable disgraced
industry but they're the lowest level of
the disgraced
industry and people ask me if I feel bad
that they fired
me not
really because since I left my uh
private subscribers on locals have more
than doubled by the way it's Scott
adams. locals.com for some reason the
numbers are zooming this week I don't
know if it's because of what I'm talking
about or not something something's
happening but suddenly all my locals
numbers went through the
roof and um also you can get the dilber
comic on the xplatform just HP my
subscribe button in the profile so so
dilber continues but it's a spicier
uncensored version using some naughty
naughty words
occasionally all right uh here's a news
report report uh about the news
reporting the news so I'm sort of a
person who talks about the news so I'm a
newsers talking about a newsers that's
going to talk about another news person
in the way they talked about the other
newsers that's what the news industry is
in 2023 it's mostly people complaining
about the other news that's mostly it
that's what I
do uh here's the actual Story the New
York Post po uh editorial board they
went after
MSNBC for what they called their
shameful shameful shameful Israel Israel
Hamas coverage and they picked out
specifically Andrea Mitchell and Iman mu
Moen and Ali veli and medim Hassan they
were singled out my guess is that they
were not pro-israel enough I assume
that's what the criticism was and I'm
not too interested in in the uh the
brother and sister fight among news
organizations but I do like the fact
that MSNBC has found themselves in the
worst of bad
positions which is a uh left leaning
entity that has to choose between Israel
and the
Palestinians you could say between
Israel and Hamas but the Palestinians
are in the middle of it
so um I'm guessing there will be more
people dying who don't who don't uh
support Hamas than there are people who
support them but there's no way to know
yet um so be careful who you back or
don't back because you'll be the target
of
Destruction
um would you like to be shocked about
something I would like to shock you now
I'm going to tell you two or three
stories in which people who had bad
opinions let's say according to other
people about the uh Israel
situation uh in which they're going to
lose
jobs or be publicly
shamed we really don't have free
speech can can we just be clear about
that well watching people get
destroyed because of their
opinions even though their opinions are
heinous are the opinions that are you
know being attacked heinous seems like
that to me sure but isn't that the whole
point of free speech so if you want to
know has America lost to free speech the
answer is yes we've lost it because we
tied it to your economic outcomes in a
way that was never as much the case
probably because social media can tell
everybody about everything right away in
the old days you could you know disgrace
yourself in one town but you know you
could always go to another town you they
they hadn't heard about it but today
free speech is no longer even slightly
practical and I think we should call it
we don't have free
speech the government maybe won't uh
perhaps the government won't attack you
but all the NPCs who are saying now
Scott I'm yelling through my screen can
you hear me that when you say Free
Speech don't you understand the
Constitution says that only applies to
the government it only applies to the
government's SC yes I hear your dumbass
stupid
point in the real world in the Practical
World in which your body has to operate
Free Speech doesn't mean a thing
if you lose your job for it if you lose
your job for free speech you don't have
fing free speech and you can about what
the founders meant blah blah blah about
what the Constitution meant I hear it
you're stupid you're stupid that
is a stupid argument we do know
what the law says we do know what they
meant everybody gets that nobody has to
explain it to us again I'm just saying
in a practical sense if you're going to
lose your job for opinion you don't have
free speech not even
close so keep that in mind when you see
New York Post attacking
MSNBC for opinions that I don't
appreciate I mean I didn't I didn't like
msnbc's opinions either but
um you know if anything happened to them
economically for it they would be too
far all right uh blinkin secretary
blinkin went to uh uh met with uh
Netanyahu in
Israel and
uh making friends of course and uh
Israel's prime minister Netanyahu is
called for sanctions against any country
that Harbors the terrorist group
Hamas now he's really talking about uh
cter now cutter is what all the people
who are trying to act smart call that
place that you call
quatar or
Qatar that's how I pretend to be like a
little bit smarter than my audience like
you you probably still pronounce it
Qatar don't
you but let me show you how it's done
Conor now I don't even think I'm saying
it right by the
way yeah I don't think I'm saying it
right but just be aware there's uh a
pronunciation thing going on there
now do you think that cutter which also
is home to a big US military base do you
think that the uh the leader of Hamas
who by the way called for this national
day of jihad um do you think that he'll
still be alive in a
month I feel like Israel could just take
a about in
Cutter because if cutter doesn't hand
him
over I think they have a free pass
absolutely everywhere
I don't think they would use it in
Cutter so that seems unlikely but I
don't think there are any rules now I
think the rules are all
gone all
right um Trump took the opportunity to
insult
Netanyahu I'm I'm not sure that was the
best choice uh under their circumstances
but remember Trump has an
uncanny uh uh he has sort of an uncanny
sense of his
Bas and I've got a feeling that the Bas
like real people have a far more nuanced
opinion about Israel than any one of us
can say in
public so Trump says what nobody could
say well maybe Netanyahu is you know not
perfect either you're not supposed to
say that no no whether it's true or
untrue irrelevant the context of you
know our closest Ally You could argue um
one of our best allies anyway in the
context of them having an existential
battle probably you should
restrain but I don't hate the fact that
he said it anyway you know what I mean I
just got done telling you that if you
can lose your job because of something
you said your opinion then that's not
free speech you know who has free
speech people running for president
apparently the only people who have free
speech because the the platforms will
ban you for your bad opinions otherwise
is if you're actually running for
president so Trump actually has free
speech so he can say something like okay
Hamas is terrible and should be
destroyed but I've also got a beef with
Netanyahu he's the only one who can say
that because he's running for president
he has free speech now of course he's
criticized for it
but will that affect the Bas not even a
little do you think the Bas cares if he
had some bad things to say about
Netanyahu but he's clearly you know
against Hamas there's no question about
that not really I think we're used to
that
um why was he mad at him oh I think Dan
yahu was uh not in favor of taking out
uh salaman when uh when Trump wanted to
a whack him so Israel was not part of
that which was probably a brilliant play
by
Netanyahu can you think of a smarter
thing for Netanyahu to do than to say we
don't want to be part of it in the
context that he knew Trump was going to
do it
anyway what would be smarter than
that nothing no it's not cowardly you're
playing chess wrong it wasn't cowardly
because it was going to happen anyway
remember the Assumption was the
Assumption was that Netanyahu knew Trump
would do it anyway right so the thing
was going to happen but he could at
least say hey I'm GNA I'm going to put
down a record where we weren't in favor
of
it that's
brilliant and and what would the only
thing that would be better than that is
having Trump out him in
public the best case scenario is during
the context of this war think about it
the best thing that could happen to
Netanyahu is for a story to come out and
it came out through Trump that Netanyahu
was not in favor of a decapitation
strike in
Iran is this a coincidence that we learn
about it at the exact best time for
Netanyahu that doesn't feel like a
coincidence but it's Trump so I mean
maybe he was just telling he could have
been just telling you what he feels so
you can't be sure that this is any kind
of clever plan but it does look to me
like both Trump and
Netanyahu if if this is intentional and
I don't know that it
is it was kind of
brilliant because it g it gave trump it
made Trump look like he had a little
Nuance to him which is actually kind of
a good look that you can call balls and
Strikes on both sides that's a good look
I don't hate that at the the timing is
suspicious right maybe he shouldn't do
it now but the fact that he outed just a
really
critical political piece of information
that Israel was opposed to a
decapitation strike in
Iran kind perfect kind of
perfect there are reports that Syria is
under attack presumably by Israel the
Damascus Airport and the Aleppo Airport
uh were taken on a service I assume
that's because there were thoughts that
maybe somebody from those airports would
be taking off I don't know with drones
or helicopters or something so but I'm
surprised I'm surprised that Israel
would have thought that
Syria would get involved in a kinetic
way you know with actual Assets in the
air I don't know there's something about
that story that doesn't add up it's
obviously
related to the actions in Gaza but I
don't know
exactly exactly how that helps maybe
we'll find out
more but it wouldn't have anything to do
with rocket attacks would it unless they
were unless they had some kind of Rocket
artillery or something
there all right well we don't know what
that is we'll keep an eye on
it um there were rumors the other day
that Putin was almost dead or was dead
but he's he seemed to have appeared on
TV he's 71 years old and he appeared on
TV and did not look like he was
dying um what he did say was interesting
he said he might be might be well he's
going to offer to help mediate uh the
Israel and Hamas
situation and he's told it International
media uh quote well this is you know
translated well why not we have had very
stable business relations with Israel
we've had friendly relations with
Palestine for decades and I thought to
myself you know what yes why
not why not I I believe Israel tried to
be um stay out of the Ukraine
situation I'm sure that Russia
appreciated
that so why
not
um let me say something that I think
many of you were thinking but didn't
want to say out
loud um in the long long
run we're going to have to be allies
with Russia whether that's you know
during Putin or after it's not
optional you all know that
right that allying with Russia in the
long term is not
optional because the
um the
Hamas let's say effect is going to grow
it's not going to shrink there will be
more and more you know border like
things now let me also say Europe is
lost you know that
right Europe's already
gone so Europe will not be an ally to
the United States in the future it is at
the moment but there isn't any way to
put the toothpaste back at the tube the
their open immigration essentially
guarantees that at some point they'll
have a majority that doesn't like
America so Europe is kind of
demographically already done we're just
you know watching the details of that
dness but
Russia being you know more of a
dictatorship kind of situation has kept
their borders you know a little more
stable and therefore they would potenti
have energy and an economy and a
military which we're definitely not
going to want to be on the other side
from wherever we are so in the long long
run you know the world will form by you
know largely
religious um religious
groups and you're going to want to want
Russ on your side maybe you don't want
Putin but you're definitely going to
want
Russia all right
um you know I've been trying to avoid
this story but you just can't avoid it
it's uh babies with their own heads
um let let's start by agreeing you've
never heard anything
worse now I tell you that persuasion is
a visual thing and I tell you that the
two most important the two most
powerful uh
persuasive let's say themes are fear
number one fear beats all persuasion if
you think you're in immediate danger
you're not thinking about anything else
it focuses the mind and makes you have
to act on that fear but after fear the
most uh the most persuasive element is a
visual but it doesn't have to be you
looking at a picture at the moment the
visual could be something you saw once
and just remember or something that was
described to you in a way that you
created the picture in your head and you
can't get that out your head now this is
the case of the latter it is
impossible to not think of the thing
that people are talking about if I tell
you to don't think of an elephant you
know this is the famous famous example
if I say don't think of an an elephant
you see an elephant I didn't have to
show you a picture of an elephant that
elephant's right in your head and it's
not going anywhere right so when people
talk about this story the most horrible
thing I've ever heard of in my life
actually literally I can't think of
anything I've ever heard of that was
more horrible than this the idea that
there might be multiple beheaded
babies
so
um here's an update on that uh an is
Israeli official told CNN quote we
cannot confirm the claim that Hamas
attackers beheaded children during
Saturday's
attack and uh this comes after uh Biden
said something like he uh you know he
was aware of this report but he was just
saying he heard it from somebody in
Israel he hadn't seen any pictures but
he he said something unclear that made
people think well maybe he saw a picture
maybe he's confirming it but one Israeli
official said they can't confirm it uh I
told you the other day it it may have
come from primarily One Source I don't
want to debunk
this and I can't anyway right I because
I don't know what's happening my guess
is that it started with something real
at the base of it there probably was
something horrible but we don't know how
how much of it there was or even the the
circumstances that might have caused
somebody to see something that
horrible um but I will say that uh
Israel is using it in an insanely genius
way which is to put that picture in your
head and you'll never get it out because
it's got fear and it's got a visual and
that
visual that will never leave your head
for the rest of your life you will have
a mental image of something that you
never saw a picture
of so in terms of persuasion Israel has
the absolute Advantage with that
narrative
now uh in the context of the
horribleness that happened and we know
did happen you know the part is
confirmed the number of dead and the way
happened Etc um it's a 10 and a 10 and
horribleness can we all agree it's a 10
and a 10 it's you can't get worse than
the stuff we know actually happened so
whether or not something specially
terrible happened to any particular
group it's still a 10 and of 10 right
you can't get worse than pure evil you
know there's no such thing as two times
pure evil that's just pure evil it's
more pure
evil so whether it's true or not it is
directionally true have you ever heard
me say that
before the the decapitated babies is
directionally true in the sense that
other stuff was that bad so you know I
don't mind that this narrative is the
dominant narrative because it's
directionally it's in the ballpark I
accept
it here's what you should expect public
opinion is going to start dramatically
swinging toward not Hamas but the
Palestinians for
sure um and the reason is that humans
are
again we are um we're persuaded by
visual images so you're going to have a
let's say a reduction in the visual
images of Carnage in Israel there'll
still be some but there will be an
increase in the horrible images coming
out of uh
Gaza so there's nothing you can do about
that because that's where the war is so
you're just going to see more and more
of that stuff
um which should have the predictable
effect of bringing out more Sympathy for
the uh Palestinians and they are they
are deserving of a lot of sympathy
because what's going to happen is pretty
bad and is happening is super bad well
let me say a few things about that
number
one I'm trying to understand these two
things there are two things which I
understand to be different things one is
that um it
people are saying that the residents of
Gaza the ones who whether they support
Hamas or not are just you know
non-combatants uh some are saying that
Hamas will not let the non-combatants
leave that they would kill them if they
tried to leave and I'm sure that's true
in some ways in pockets for sure
but we're also told that Hamas is
underground that they're living
underground did they take did they take
the residence
underground how big were these caves
were the caves big enough that they
could take the non-combatants
underground because I'm thinking
probably
not and if they did there wouldn't be
enough food and water for the Hamas
Fighters because they'd have to share it
at that
point so I'm trying I'm trying to
reconcile these two things how is it
that the
non-combatants can't get out because
theoretically they would have free
passage and then they could get food and
water and electricity and stuff
theoretically I I hope that's the
situation but if if a moss is
underground doesn't that create massive
opportunities for the residents to just
run for
it like I don't think they would be
gunned down if you saw a bunch of women
and children you know running for safety
I don't think anybody's going to shoot
at
him so I got some questions about how
the everybody's under underground if
they're
Hamas correlates with the fact that a
massive population which is way bigger
than the fighters they don't have lots
of ways to get out of town so there's
something about the story I don't get
yet maybe we'll never get
that yeah H Hamas is among the
population but if most Hamas is
underground and most of the population
is above ground I don't see how they can
prevent the population from doing what
it needs to do so that's just a
question um next observation is we have
assumed something that I think is the
wrong assumption about what happens next
we assume that Israel will go door Todo
Street to Street and there will be booby
traps and massive casualties because you
can't clear a City without massive
casualties on the attacking
side however it is
2023 and I'm trying to understand why
anybody would knock on a
door in
2023 wouldn't you wouldn't you put a uh
you know put a big explody thing in the
wall open up the wall wait for the dust
to clear fly in your little uh drone and
then actually just go room to room with
the Drone and then when you find
somebody go ooo run away you know in
case you want to save your drone blow up
the building then move to the next
building wouldn't you go wouldn't you go
building to building and clear them with
drones because it's 2023 right and and I
think we also have technology now that
can see through
walls um in some limited cases it's it's
easier if you have Wi-Fi if you have
Wi-Fi that can see right through the
wall but that's turned off
now yeah
heat heat Etc movement so so here's what
I
expect uh you're going to find out about
Israel's technical
capabilities and you're going to be
impressed I think because I think
they've always known they would have to
go uh door too clearly they have an
advanced drone
operation and clearly they have small
ones they could go through a hole in the
wall go through a
window
so I think it's a drone War now
uh yeah a drone and shotgun range won't
last long but it's worth a drone to find
where the shotgun
was because you're looking for the
shotgun so I I feel like the drones work
as long as you have enough
drones why would you send anything else
so think of what the drones could do one
thing the drones could do would be um
helping the helping the civilians get to
safety could you imagine you're you're a
civilian group and you're like huddling
because you don't know what to do you
know you're afraid of the attacks coming
in but you don't know how to get
out imagine you're sitting there and a
drone pops over and it's got a
microphone on it or a speaker and the
Drone says you know we're we will lead
you to safety follow me yeah we we have
determined that the following street is
cleared and you have free passage you
know you might want to send like a few
people just to test it out but just
follow us and they literally follow the
Drone you know the Drone just says just
follow me and maybe even the Drone goes
you know like a block ahead and looks
left and right right so you could
imagine the scenario where the drones
lead people to safety now more likely
they would not trust the Drone they
would think it was a trick but at least
it's an
option it's going to be a big your own
fights uh Bill akman still hedge fund
guy Bill akman still going after Harvard
for the uh many many Harvard groups
which signed some letter saying that uh
Israel was totally to blame for what's
happening and I guess a number of the
people in those organizations said whoa
whoa I'm in the organization but nobody
asked me about this letter or uh I'm in
the organization but I don't agree with
the letter or I didn't know about it or
didn't know what I was signing and Amman
is giving them a real life
lesson welcome to the adult World he's
basically saying you know here's your
options if you weren't on board with the
letter publicly disavow them quit the
organization or get the organization to
resend it you know real world here's
what you
don't get to do be a graduate of an
elite University with a good uh
reputation who couldn't figure out how
to navigate this
situation can't do that yeah no nobody's
going to respect you if you stay in the
group that did that
now let me weigh in with my opinion what
do I think of these many Harvard groups
who said it was all Israel's fault well
I don't like them at all I don't like
them at all I'm very angry at
them do they have free speech do the
students who put out those statements
have free speech oh yes they do Scott
because in a technical way the
government is not saying anything about
it and free speech is only about the
government it's not about private
institutions Scott okay you can shut up
now just shut up everybody gets that
NPCs but do these students have free
speech well the the free market is is
certainly responding I would say
no I would say in a practical sense they
don't have free
speech now do I think that they should
be um left
unmolested because their opinion well it
is a war you know we're fighting for our
lives and you know I don't have any
objection to anybody going hard at them
I have
myself and I don't have an objection to
them never getting
jobs because they have revealed their
character as Bill Amman says it's not so
much what they said you know amman's
giving them a real life lesson it's not
what you said it's that now we know who
you are that's different all right it's
very different it's not really your
speech that's the problem it's the fact
that your speech revealed who you are
and nobody would want that in their
business same with the
pronouns all
right so how bad a day is Harvard having
well I was looking at the trending list
on Twitter and at one point trending at
the same time were Harvard David Duke
and day of
jihad so from a public relations
perspective not ideal not
ideal uh here's another similar story
NYU Law School Bar Association
president um
had her job offer rescinded because she
also publicly blamed
Israel does this law school Bar
Association president have free
speech no not in a practical sense
because she's punished hard and probably
was going to have trouble forever
because of it do I agree with her
statement No I don't agree with
her but she doesn't have free Free
Speech all right in a practical sense
but of course she does in a
constitutional
sense well for uh a long time I've been
offering that I would try to deprogram
somebody who is a um associated with the
left a Democrat I got a
volunteer so we're scheduled so on
Spaces the audio feature on the
xplatform on Monday I'll be talking to a
gentleman named Caesar who's at data 5
and in his profile he says fuk
Mega and he interacted with me on a few
tweets so let me tell you when that's
scheduled so you don't miss it and then
I'll say a little bit more about it so
on
Monday um so it'll be 3:30 my time that
means 6:30 eastern time so 6:30 eastern
time on the spaces I'll talk to Caesar
now here's what you need to know about
it it's not a
debate it's not a debate and I'll have
to explain that to Caesar in case in
case there's any uh clarifications
needed p.m 6:30 p.m. on Monday PM
eastern time that's eastern time and but
what I'm going to do is H try to
deprogram him so I'm not going to try to
change his mind or I'm not going to
impose my preferences or or opinions on
him I'm simply going to to deprogram him
I'm going to remove the
parts that are not based on facts and
just see what happens sort of an
experiment all
right but uh props to Caesar because
he's going into the lion's den and he's
willing to do it and I I respect that I
appreciate
it all right um I did a tweet that did
not get me double triple canceled but
it's only because people figured out
what I was up
to I I thought this one could be
misinterpreted but I feel like taking a
chance so here's here's what I
tweeted uh I said there could be peace
in the Middle East tomorrow if Israel
negotiated in good faith with Hamas and
agreed to accept a reasonable level of
murder per year the way America does
with the
cartels so America tells the cartels and
you all know this America cels and
cartels effectively you can't kill more
than a 100,000 a year that's our
limit 100,000 people murdered in America
per year you don't go beyond that if you
go beyond that well there might be a
price to pay but as long as you stay
below a 100,000 a year yeah business as
usual so I thought well why can't Israel
just do that and say we won't go to war
with you but just keep your murder down
to 5 10,000 a year I mean you have to
adjust for population of course but you
know keep it under 5,000 a
year you're you're way ahead of
me as David boxing horn said in the
comments to my note that's what Israel
has been doing for years they just
didn't put a number on it but basically
basically they said we will accept EX
amount of murder to avoid a war but X
was exceeded so Hamas exceeded X and now
Gaza will be pretty much
destroyed so but this was uh um should
not be interpreted as a comment about
Israel it was my way of insulting the
United States for its handling of fenol
but I think most of you got
that all right
I feel like there was a story or
two that uh I missed did
I was there a story I missed anything
that you want to hear an opinion on
before I
go Netanyahu would have closed our
borders well he didn't close his own
border too good did
he
um get away
from
dtz um I Heard dtz has interesting
opinions that I have not heard yet so
I'll go check that
out all right ladies and gentlemen
thanks for joining on these various
platforms um and it looks like Rumble
didn't work again I'll go look at that I
think that's a technical problem on my
end and I will talk to you
tomorrow thanks for joining
