Papa
good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
today will be
probably the least important
live stream I've ever done but
possibly the funniest possibly
I've got a joke that I've been saving
for you that I think you'll appreciate
has to do with something that happened
in the in the headlines today
but before we get to that
I need to Prime you we need to be on
exactly the same level and to do that
all you need is
a copper mugger a glass detector
Chelsea's diet and a canteen Joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
oh yeah that's good
that's some good stuff
well you know I like to tell you about
uh technological breakthroughs that are
going to change the world
and I saw one today this is real this
has already been created and it's a
commercial product
so sometimes you'll I'll tell you
stories about oh something happened in a
laboratory and maybe in 20 years it'll
be a product
this is an actual product you can buy it
now
it's a propeller propeller driven shower
head
and removable you know it could be a
handheld as well
and what they did was they put a fan
behind the the water pressure
so that you're not depending on just the
water pressure from your pipes it shoots
out what water you have now the benefit
of this
of course if if you can if you can make
a small amount of water
act like it's a lot of water
you can see that that would be very huge
for
for women who want to use it for
masturbation
no actually also it's good for the
environment a secondary benefit I hear
the secondary benefit is it reduces
Water by 50 percent now who saw that
coming
reduced water usage by 50 percent
and actually
makes your experience better
so good news there
all right absolutely my favorite story
today
it's not good news but it's going to be
funny news
and funny news is better than good news
well maybe that's just me
but Jordan Peterson tweets he says
breaking the Ontario College of
psychologists of which he must be a
member has demanded that I submit myself
to mandatory Social Media communication
retraining where they're experts for
among other crimes retweeting Pierre
poliev and criticizing Justin Trudeau
and his political allies
do you suppose
that the Ontario College of
psychologists don't really understand
who they're talking to
does it seem to be like there's a major
disconnect
between what they're demanding
and the person they're demanding who
does it
do they understand
that there are eight billion people in
the world 8 billion people
there's exactly one of them who's going
to destroy them for saying that there's
only one person in the world who can
actually destroy them
and I think it's going to happen
now
if you know anything about Jordan
Peterson you know he's not going to
comply
but what we don't know is what form of
non-compliance he will choose and I
would like to suggest
Embrace and amplify
anybody so Dr Peterson if you're
listening to me this is my suggestion
tell them you would be happy to
participate
voluntarily voluntarily and
enthusiastically under the condition
that
their organization is sufficiently
representative by trans people
ah
are you with me
I'd like to see a breakdown of your
organization because I don't think it
would be fair to be judged by a
non-diverse entity
ah
are you with me
and how about I believe that your
process is so important I'd like to uh
I'd like permission to record it and let
the world in on this training which I
think is so valuable that it should be
something that everybody should be
exposed to not the lucky few
psychologists who get the benefit of
these resources
I would like everybody to be aware of
this excellent program but only only if
you can guarantee that you're a diverse
group and I can count on you
representing all forms of Canadian
Society anything less would be an insult
to the public
now the other way he could play it is
simply resisting but I imagine they
would lift his certifications or you
know they would try to punish him
professionally
and it might work
um
I don't know if they've noticed but
he's a gazillionaire and I don't think
he needs his certifications anymore I'm
sure he would like to keep them and I
I'm sure he wouldn't want some
government entity to yank him away for a
stupid reason but I don't think it's
exactly essential to his lifestyle
anymore
would you agree
if there's anything that he would be
willing to give up at this point
you know I mean emotionally and maybe
at a conceptual level it's an insult but
won't have any real effect on his
business I can imagine I don't know how
many individual clients he's still
seeing I got the sense he's you know
more more a public figure now but we'll
keep an eye on that but Dr Jordan
Peterson Embrace and amplify
we would love that show oh my God would
we love that show
all right uh Demar Hamlin football
player who took the hard
the uh took the hard hit and went down
and he's still on life support
and they're still trying to figure out
how to get his lungs going Etc so we're
we're hoping the best
for him but have you noticed it made the
whole world crazy
made the whole world crazy
did you watch Tucker last night Tucker
Carlson
he was angry that there were so many
doctors who were sure it was one kind of
thing this
comaditis whatever it is
now I didn't see anybody do that did you
I thought Tucker may have set up a straw
man
I didn't see anybody who said short of
actually a medical diagnosis I didn't
see any doctor
say it's definitely this thing and
definitely not these other things
but but Tucker acted like that was
happening in a widespread way did
anybody see that
you you saw several people say that they
were sure
what the cause was
I don't think you did
I think you might have misinterpreted
that
there might have been a lot of people
saying there's no evidence
of let's say vaccine related problems
about you saw people saying there's no
evidence of one one versus another but
check your false memories
I think it's a false memory because I
don't believe there's any any Doctor Who
would say in public without examining a
patient
I don't think any doctor would say that
in public
do you
so I think you might have imagined
that they had certainty when they
couldn't have possibly
yeah it couldn't have possibly
do you know what percentage of your
total memories are false memories
what do you think what percentage of all
of your memories are false
I don't know the answer but it's way
more than most people think yeah most
people would say well that seems like a
rare thing that would happen
it's not rare at all it's like a it's a
common way we operate do you know why we
have false memories
does anybody know why we have false
memories because that's a weird thing
isn't it why would you have
evolved a sense
to fool you consistently like just all
day long just fooling you about what's
real
well
there might be an ordinary biological
explanation but I'll tell you the more
obvious explanation
the more obvious explanation is it would
be probably impossible
to create a software simulation of this
reality
and have everybody remember everything
correctly
because that would mean that my
subjective story in the simulation would
have to be consistent with yours and
with all other eight billion people
the complexity of that model would be so
overwhelming that probably don't no
computer could do it now it might be an
advanced civilization too good but it's
unlikely
that you could ever handle that level of
complexity
and this also makes the assumption that
our our hypothetical creators were
something similar to we are now because
we're very close to being able to create
exactly that kind of simulation
so somebody not too far from who we are
now
maybe what humans are in 100 years
essentially the same as now but plus 100
years
um
so see if see if this
Point makes sense so first I want to see
if it makes sense like if I'm
communicating it right and then I'll ask
if you agree with it if you're a
programmer
and you say to yourself I want to build
this simulation but my computer couldn't
handle every character being consistent
with the truth of every other character
it's just too complicated so instead
I'll have everybody living almost like a
little bubble reality that only
sometimes needs to be consistent with
other people just on the big stuff
you know like what is the law yeah the
big stuff but on the individual stuff
like who said what yesterday
did you say that or did you say the
other thing were you there or were you
not there you know that sort of thing
that that all that all turns into just
Illusions so each character in The
simulation can have its own illusion and
it never needs to be consistent and you
don't see it in normal life
in normal life you're just going about
your business and other people have
different ideas in their head than you
do of what what is real but you don't
notice
like there's somebody walking around in
the in the store who believes that God
is talking to them right now like having
an actual conversation but you don't
so you're it's total different realities
so that reality in mind don't need to
ever correspond we don't need to make
them fit they could just be different
forever and then your computer code
can be quite simple
each character is a little bubble they
don't have to be consistent with the
other characters except in just the
biggest stuff
it's it's it's totally the most likely
explanation
it doesn't mean it's true
but if you had to bet on it by far
that's the most ordinary common obvious
explanation of why our memories are
routinely false
see it'd be one thing I would call it
just a mistake
if we were sometimes had false memories
but you're almost your entire memory of
your uh your childhood
at this point is mostly false you know
it's been reiterated by um not
reiterated but it's been modified by
photos of your childhood that you saw
try having this experience sit down with
a childhood friend
and discuss a specific event
with a childhood friend or family member
watch how different they are
and it could be this different hey do
you remember Bobby when you threw that
rock through the neighbor's window
and then Bobby looks at you and says
that was you
you threw the rock through the window I
did
you be like what
how could you possibly how could we
disagree on that no you threw the rock
no you did you your disagreements would
be that fundamental
all right
so uh while we talked about Demar Hamlin
so
this is just another two World thing so
part of the world has decided
that there's some certainty about what
happened
another part of the world has decided
there's a different certainty and
another part has decided how would you
know
I I'm still in the how would you know
category
so so there are people who are yelling
at me but Scott
don't you know it could have been just
the blow itself
but that would be rare
but rare things happen that doesn't rule
it down at all
um but it could have been it could have
been
maybe some vaccination injury made it
more likely
that there would be cardiac damage with
a hit to which I say
maybe why would I rule that out
can you imagine me ruling that out
based on what I have no information it
would rule rule in or anything except
I'm completely open
we'll see what happens
I wouldn't be surprised
so let me let me say this as directly as
possible
if if a week from now that the doctors
say you know we looked into it it looks
like our best hypothesis is it's vaccine
injury
now I don't think that's likely to
happen
but if it did
I want to tell you now that I'm mentally
prepared to accept that
so what I'm not going to do so by the
way this is a lesson in cognitive
dissonance in order to protect myself
from cognitive dissonance which which
this would trigger me
if you're sure of something and then you
get proven wrong in front of other
people or even in front of yourself
you'll be triggered so I want to make
sure that even if uh things go away I
don't expect I won't get triggered
because I'm saying in public
that wouldn't surprise me
wouldn't surprise me so whatever it
turns out wouldn't surprise me now let
me ask you this
if it turns out that he's vaccinated of
course he is
because the professional athletes are
but if it turns out he also had Coven in
the past
does anybody know that
do any of you know if he's actually had
covet because the shots wouldn't prevent
it
you don't know that do you
think about the fact that you don't know
that
just think about that that we got to
today and you just think about the fact
that we got to today
and nobody knows if he's had covet
doesn't matter you think it doesn't
matter if he's had covet
have you heard of long covet
do you know what it could cause
cardiac issues
right potentially
now some of you are going to say no
there is proof that long covet does not
cause any problems and it's not real
no there's no proof of that
and by the way I'm not I'm not saying
I'm not saying that long code is real or
causes anything particular how would I
know
how would I possibly know because I
don't think science knows so how the
hell would I know right
uh so I want you to I want you to just
hold this in your mind all right
and by the way I have to confess
uh I heard this from somebody smart
so this is not my this is not my own
realization uh and I I'm not gonna name
names just because I don't have
permission to talk about a private
conversation but
just think about the fact that you went
through more than 24 hours with this
story
and it never occurred to you to wonder
if he had coveted before because long
covet would get you into the same risk
category
as as the vaccine itself in the sense
that you can't calculate the risk
I'm not saying they're the same only in
the sense that you can't calculate
either one so you'd just be guessing
Martinez
yeah so so of course because the news
likes to serve up a confirmation bias
Martina navachalova who was very very
pro-vaccine has double cancer
that's not this isn't funny right so my
point is it's very unlikely it's because
of what she was saying in public
they got her double cancer I'm sure it's
a coincidence
but of course once again if I turn down
to be wrong about that
I'm prepared to say yeah you know that
was a possibility
so people are saying wait a minute the
most outspoken pro-vaccine person just
got double cancer two different cancers
at the same time I don't know how often
that happens
um but it doesn't mean it happens
rarely I just don't know how often that
happens and then uh
Djokovic
who refused famously refused the
vaccinations is perfectly healthy
so what does that prove
it proves nothing it's just too to two
athletes it just proves nothing
all right
um
there's big news about
there's a video of Representative gosar
who is identified with the far right
he's one of those uh one of those 19 or
so Republicans who were resisting Kevin
McCarthy for a speaker and this video of
him chatting away with AOC
and everybody was like oh what's
happening
how can they talk it's like fire and
water
they cannot be in the same place now
they have a history because gosar did a
I guess he spread a meme
showing him murdering AOC and Biden I
don't I don't remember seeing the meme
but it couldn't have been
too serious
right it couldn't have been that serious
but I would you know I I don't disagree
with AOC if she says
that a representative
spreading a meme that shows they're
getting murdered is too far
I think that would be a reasonable
opinion all right Free Speech still
allows it but I think if she wants to
you know scold a little bit on that
that's maybe not the worst thing in the
world
yeah maybe you need a little pressure to
keep people civil
Pepsi Man spent two dollars to say that
Ben Garrison owns me
that was that was two dollars well spent
there
I didn't know NPCs had money
just found that out all right
who pays me who pays me money to tell me
that that somebody owns me
you know I would invite the rest of you
if you'd like to mock me
and be sure that I saw it you can do a
super chat on YouTube
that allows you to pay money to
guarantee that you're cutting insults
are are noted
and that would really show me
I mean if you really want to if you
really want to dunk on me
you do it that way you dunk on me with
money so that it shows you mean it
otherwise I don't know if you mean it I
mean how could I take you seriously put
some money behind it damn it put a
little money behind it let's see you
really insult me come on come on
come on you bastards come on bring it on
all right
I guess it was only one of them
all right um another story about we're
not done with AOC and gosar and I saw
somebody tweet uh they were looking for
a body language or a lip reading expert
so that we knew what they were saying
well
fortunately I'm here for you because I'm
both
and I examined the video and I
determined that AOC really wanted to get
away
so AOC
starts out gosar is sitting on her right
and he's sort of he's leading in so go
Star is totally leaning in and frankly
maybe getting a little too close to her
personal space but he looked like he was
just friendly and political it didn't
look weird
but she looked like she was very
uncomfortable
like she she didn't turn toward him had
she been comfortable she would have she
would have opened up and turned toward
him but she stayed facing the other
direction and just turned her head and
at some points her face looked you know
uncomfortable and at one point she did
like this little mouth thing like you
know God why am I listening to this guy
it was sort of like this
you know just this is a little mouth
thing it was sort of like dismissing him
and he's chatting away
but then you keep watching
if you keep watching
she starts to engage
I'm not gonna I'm gonna not gonna take
the L unless you pay me money
paid money you cheap bastard if you want
to keep complaining
how can I how could I pay attention to
you otherwise put your money behind it
put your money behind your mouth
if if you want to say uh the idiot Ben
Garrison uh owned me I'd like to see you
pay for that
come on
all right I'm sure there's at least one
more dumb person who will pay for that
I'd like to see if I can like encourage
him
all right but um
so gozar tweeted because once it became
a headline he tweeted what he was saying
to AOC
and that his his tweet was funny it goes
uh so then I says quote the combustion
engine was actually a miracle of
engineering that people take for granted
today
that's pretty funny good line
uh but I have another theory based on my
uh lip reading
and my knowledge of Representative gosar
I don't know if you know he's a dentist
so prior to being a representative in
Congress he was a dentist still is a
dentist I guess and uh
uh I'll grab his lips and it said he was
uh
he was offering to fill aoc's cavity he
was offering to fill her cavity
okay come on that was worth you
attending today
that that was your payoff all the rest
of it is filler
that was just one good joke
to make it worth you coming today
there you go one good job
um
some people say that uh the the dentist
was talking to her because she looked
sad and
you know
I ruined the joke I was going a
different direction let me back up like
I hadn't said that last few sentences I
forgot how the joke goes
you know representative gosar seemed sad
but that makes sense for a dentist
because dentists
are often looking a little down in the
mouth
yeah dentists
often look down in the mouth
all right if you're not American that's
a famous American saying looking down in
the mouth means you're sad
um
so
and it's interesting that a person who
does cosmetic dentistry for a living
is being blamed for a meme about uh
capping AOC cappinger
okay that was that wasn't my leading
joke
I'm now down in the list a little bit
we're in the the Lesser puns
maybe I should just should I pull out
now
should I back up stay stick with my
winner and just just get out yeah quit
good I that is good advice
you don't always give me good advice
but that's good advice pull out quit
your losses all right speaking of that
uh
you saw that you might have seen the
story about the ukrainians pulling off a
massive successful strike on a base of
Russian soldiers who were all huddled
indoors
um
in some building that they had had been
for some other purpose
so they I think it was a high Mars
probably system just destroyed the
entire base ukrainians say it killed
hundreds the Russians were emitting 89
and this is interesting
that the Russians say that the way the
ukrainians identified
the place to attack is that the soldiers
were against orders were using cell
phones
do you believe that
do you believe that's actually how they
were found
Maybe
I have to think that you can't really
tell the difference between a Ukrainian
and a Russian when you walk down the
street
do you think that's true
do you think do you think where the
Russians are camped out for the winter
do you think that area
if a Ukrainian citizen walked by in the
snow you know with a snow hat on versus
a Russian citizen with a snow hat on
could you tell the difference
I mean and is there even any
documentation that you could check it's
not like everybody's being stopped on
the street right
they don't look different come on
somebody say they look different no so
don't you think that the ukrainians have
totally infiltrated
the Russian positions with citizens
right because there are citizens sort of
all around where the Russian troops are
or they're not
so it seems obvious to me that the
ukrainians Have Eyes on the ground
do you think the ukrainians couldn't
notice where hundreds of troops sleep
every night
all they have to do is find one troop
like one soldier say I found him and
then just follow that one soldier until
it's bedtime
and then they'd know where he goes to
sleep
and then you call in a strike
right I feel like there could be nothing
easier than identifying the indoor
places the soldiers or camped for the
winter
am I wrong about that it would be the
simplest thing you could do
right because all the soldiers have to
come out of that building during the day
and all you have to do is is watch where
they go at night you could pick any one
of them and just follow them and you
wouldn't even have to follow them all
day you just have to wait till like five
o'clock at night you know when it's
getting dark
and just follow one
and you don't think that they have Ariel
you know aerial surveillance
Dr Ben is just yelling you're wrong at
caps all right but here's my larger
point
regardless of how they're spotting the
soldiers
do you think that given that the
ukrainians can send
a high Mars missile
to exactly where they want anywhere in
that occupied territory
won't they eventually take out all of
the barracks
like all of them
because here's my assumption there's no
way that the soldiers can
spread out because they can't sleep
Outdoors
because of the weather if you can't
sleep Outdoors you're going to be
clustered
in large groups indoors
I don't see how you can avoid that
so it seems to me that the
um the ukrainians
are going to be able to pick out all of
the above ground buildings anyway and
just pick them off all winter long
this seems like a really
well building yeah yeah I suppose they
could be distributed and for force
people to let them in their homes but I
don't I don't expect the Russians to be
that capable
the Russians have so far shown that they
just do what they always do and I think
they would just keep doing what they
always do until they're all wiped out
they don't seem to adjust
so we'll see all right so I'm going to
make a prediction
prediction
the Russian troops Barracks will be
exposed and there will be multiple
attacks over the winter
because it would be the most devastating
thing to attack
all right
for one thing it causes the news to get
back to
um back to the Homeland where if Ukraine
attacks you know
if they attack an anti uh let's say they
attack Russia's artillery position
there's nobody in Russia who cares oh
Russia lost an artillery position
yeah but if you hear that several
hundred of your Russian young men just
got wiped out for no good reason
that makes you feel different
so the ukrainians have a strategy that
to me looks like they will win the
winter
so let's let me make the prediction this
way Ukraine will win the winter
Scott Ritter is having a belly laugh
that's right you know Scott Ritter
uh well I'm not going to say it
but let's just say you should uh
check the affiliations of all your
sources doesn't Scott Ritter write for a
Russian publication RT
so you would be taking Russia's national
magazine as your Counterpoint
okay uh fact check that for me
well Missouri carried out uh this is a
headline in CNN CNN didn't know how to
handle this story it's a little awkward
it's a little awkward but I'll tell you
how they handled it
um so Missouri carried out the first
known U.S execution of an openly
transgender person Tuesday
and they noted two things the first
thing CNN noted is besides the fact it's
the first uh trans person to be executed
they noted that it's very rare for a
woman to be executed for murder
very rare for a woman to be executed for
murder hardly ever happens so that was
worth noting because the Rarity of women
being executed for rape especially
so part of the crimes were rape and
murder
but the number of women who have ever
been prosecuted and and executed for
rape as CNN quite helpfully noted
Quay healthily noted very rare very rare
that women have been executed for rape
it's good to know that's good context
is totally insane
now the insane part
the insane part is how CNN is trying to
handle it
because because they're trying to make a
point about the first woman
because that's that's a big thing they
do the first woman this first woman that
you know hardly any women
uh
so anyway
yeah that's rare
so I'm a pro-trans but I'm glad that
they've reached a level of equality
where they can be executed possibly at
the same rate
as everybody else because you're not
really you're not really in any kind of
a fair system
if you're not executed you know any of
your downtrodden minorities
you got to get that you got to get the
ratio up so they're they're being killed
by the state at roughly the same level
as you know white man and and black man
and women I'd like I'd like to state to
be killing people that
Something parody
because it does it seems unfair there's
just not enough killing of the of
some groups you need a lot more killing
now you might say well we would do more
killing but they would have to commit
more crimes I think that's short term
that's short thinking short-sighted
well the Twitter files are back in the
news
and as Elon Musk tweeted the U.S
government agency demanded suspension of
250 000 accounts including journalists
and Canadian officials
in what I think they were trying to get
rid of Russian interference
but then when Twitter looked at the
accounts
or or Chinese interference to some
foreign interference but uh
but Twitter found you know very few
accounts that actually looked like they
were problems but what are the criteria
that Twitter was using is if you were
following
at least two Chinese diplomatic accounts
then you got you got flagged for you
know maybe removal but I don't think
Twitter used that rule I think that's
what the was it the gec
um
it appeared based on DHS data so two
government agencies involved directly
and indirectly and
imagine that imagine if you followed two
or more Chinese diplomatic accounts you
would be put on a list to maybe be
banned from Twitter
now
you know what I said when I saw that
damn it Chad Chan Chan
now if you don't know I I have a my
favorite nemesis
named Jeb on Twitter now Twitter puts a
little notification on his account that
he's affiliated
with the Chinese government now he says
no that he's a citizen just with his own
opinions but Twitter labels him as
affiliate now I follow him
because I I'm fascinated by him because
he's so good he's like really really
good at being a
let's say an advocate you know I don't
want to characterize it beyond that but
as an advocate he's just a really good
Tweeter he tweets really well so I
follow him and we've had some humorous
interactions because of his affiliation
with Chinese government
but think about it I was I might have
been one follow away from being uh
labeled a Chinese spy
now I'm not sure if his account
qualifies as being diplomatic probably
not but you could so easily you could so
easily end up on a list for completely
the wrong reason I mean I mean and let
me ask you this do you think that I got
Shadow banned
because I follow a known Chinese
operative on Twitter
Maybe
right if if they were looking into the
accounts that followed two or more
diplomatic accounts
you can imagine that the algorithm might
suppress people who had a little too
much Chinese government following going
on and that might have been me
so I might have accidentally got myself
into a you know algorithmic Shadow band
there's no confirmation that that
happened
um
yeah but you know it's a weird world
could have happened
all right
and it's a super slow news day
is there anything happening oh we didn't
talk about uh McCarthy
so Congress is uh noodling about who to
make their uh
Speaker of the House cabin McCarthy the
leading candidate
um Trump actually endorsed McCarthy
today from his truth account
so the trumps are on board with McCarthy
and the
um
the small group of Republicans were who
are trying to oppose it
uh may end up with getting
a Democrat elected to the role that the
the Republicans believe they won so
let's see who are the resistors we've
got representative Matt Gates
we've got Andy Biggs of Arizona
uh and some other people uh bobert
Etc yeah bobert is in there and let me
ask you this what do you think of Matt
Gates strategy
so Matt Gates seems to be the primary
name who is opposing McCarthy being just
put and Chip Roy as well
um what do you think of the strategy
who owns atoms
let me stop here here's a Critic who I'm
going to uh agree with
so I don't disagree with all my critics
so this one is saying who owns Adams
that's exactly the right question
that's exactly the right question you
should look into it
right
that you should ask that question about
everybody
okay
um here's what I think of Gates's
strategy I don't think it's understood I
don't think people know why he's doing
it
why do you think he's doing it do you
think it's because he doesn't want
McCarthy to be the speaker
some say attention some say to improve
what appointments he gets so he could
to push right
to get Leverage
to negotiate for something but you know
they've been offered things that they
turned down so it's almost as if they're
not negotiating for
special benefits
apparently they're not that interested
in committee assignments
I'm not sure that's true but
drain the swamp
wants to be king all right I'll give you
my
uh best case
scenario
Gates was sort of uh
let's say he had a couple of accounts
against him one is he was too close to
Trump
which could be politically disastrous
after January 6. and
the second was he was accused of some uh
I don't know trafficking or something
which he's been cleared of so he's he's
a politician who probably wants to stay
in politics who was pushed down to the
lowest level of uh let's say I don't
know credibility or political viability
or something
yeah sexual impropriety years he was
accused of but that all went away
so innocent until proven guilty same
standard so here's here's what I think
and none of us can read his mind so
let's agree that we don't know right but
I'm going to take the point of view that
he's uh
a very good Persuader and a very good
strategist
now if that's not true
then what I'm saying wouldn't make any
sense at all
but here's what I think
I think he found uh just Gates himself I
think he found a path
toward credibility
I think he's rehabilitating himself
by picking by picking a fight that only
only the outcasts can fight
bobert's kind of similar bobert's a
little bit of an outcast
but she can take on a fight that you
can't
because she can take the bow you know
the slings and arrows and a regular
person doesn't want to Matt Gates can
take any any blow at this point you know
any arrows any any attacks because it
won't get worse
right the the most dangerous person is a
person who's backed into a corner
and I would say the Gaze was politically
backed into a corner where he had
nothing to lose
so he can go big
Gates can go big he can simply take a
bigger risk than a normal politician not
by choice it wasn't his choice to be in
this situation it's just he ended up
there so instead of just a weekly going
away because his political fortunes got
diminished you know just say oh I think
I'd like a job in the private sector
he has decided to go right at it
and in my opinion his strategy for his
own career
is really good
really good that's different from
agreeing with what he's doing right
we'll talk about that but in terms of
raising his profile as the strongest
voice
for the slightly more right you know
slightly more competitive part of the
Republican party it's a pretty good play
it's a good play because there was a
there was a void there
there wasn't a credible good voice there
was more right than the party you know a
little bit more right
and he is really good at communication
if you saw his speech I tweeted around
and as I said in the tweet
forget about personalities and forget
about the the policies and the politics
for a moment and just look at the skill
level
that Matt Gates brought to his little
speech he gave on Congress about who
should be speaker it was tremendous
it was it was like a double plus triple
plus it was as good as you've ever seen
now
If he if he establishes himself as that
person who's a little bit more right
than the Republican base
or the Republicans congress not the base
he might be closer to the base I don't
know
but he becomes that person and then he
does it on you and then he does an
unusually good job of it
suddenly his past his past problems
start to dissipate now it gets even
better
he is now publicly disagreeing with
Trump
because Trump said today yeah let's get
it over with to elect Kevin McCarthy
and gase is still resistant
so this is the best thing Gates could
have ever done
he's doing something that's popular with
the base which is being tough on his own
Republicans that's very popular right
now and he's also disagreeing with Trump
in public on a very big issue
so he's got some distance now because he
also had to get rid of he's uh Trump's
lap dog right
so he's definitely not Trump's lap dog
because he's disagreeing on a really big
issue
so politically this is one of the most
clever
plays that you'll see
and I'll tell you if you underestimate
Matt Gates's political instincts
that would be a mistake
like I don't know how far he'll go and
I'm not saying you know I Back Him in
all things or anything like that but
just in terms of skill level if you
underestimate him that's a big mistake
same thing I say about AOC right you can
just like AOC for political reasons blah
blah but don't underestimate her that's
just a mistake
so
I think it's a brilliant play secondly
I would agree with uh Tucker Carlson's
take on this that this this fight that
the Republicans having with each other
feels like the right fight doesn't it
isn't that the fight you want because we
act like we act like disagreeing is
always bad it's not always bad it's what
drives the system
so you see a bunch of people honestly
disagreeing I think it's an honest
disagreement I think this is coming from
the right place they're they're playing
it down in public
thank you thank you for doing this in
public
transparency High
uh disagreement High
probability of settling it one way or
the other good good it's not doomed in
any way
this is this is the best
literally this is the best of America
right now
this is exactly what I want to say
now it's ugly
is messy but that is our system it's
ugly and messy that's what Tucker said
so I'm mimicking him a little bit all
right so I don't know you you we can
find something to complain about
anything
but it's really hard to find something
to complain about this system you can
complain about the outcome but the
system looks kind of solid at the moment
the the free speech is happening right
all the members of Congress do not seem
they're not holding back they're saying
exactly what they think
the public sees it all
and I love the fact that there's
infighting within a party because that's
what makes any party better right that's
how they that's how they improve
it's all good to me this is just all
good news however it turns out and I
like the fact I know you hate it but
Matt Gates actually said directly yes I
will accept a Democrat Jeff Hakeem
Jeffries as the speaker of the house if
that's if that's my alternative if my
alternative is to bend to the
Republicans I will bend all the way to a
Democrat speaker if that's what you want
to do now does he mean it
doesn't mean it
don't know don't know
the fact that you don't know if he means
that is what makes it work right if you
were sure he didn't mean that it
wouldn't work but I believe he sold it
in my opinion he sold it at least to the
public you know maybe maybe the members
of Congress are a little more Savvy but
you sold it to me
I actually believe
that if they don't get their way
they will allow Hakeem Jeffries to be to
be in that office
I think it's possible
right now if that happened uh I think
Gates's political Futures would be in
real trouble
real trouble so I think he's saying it
for a fact and it's working
so it's a really good thing to say for
effect because there's no point in
bluffing
if you're going to say it's a bluff
right they basically asked them wait a
minute are you bluffing well what's he
supposed to say yeah yeah oh you caught
me I was hoping nobody would ask but now
they've asked yeah I don't want to lie
it's just a bluff
now
I think it's a bluff
I do think it's a bluff but he he
totally sold it as a as at least
possible but it's probably a bluff
all right
uh
which is what Trump wanted with January
6.
all right
what
I don't know what some of these comments
are referring to they're all confusing
um
but there's nothing else that's
interesting about that it's probably
probably be settled today I guess
all right did I miss any stories
anything else happening
uh I didn't see fetterman get sworn in
some people say he wasn't looking good
but I think that's probably subjective
um
we sort of made up the stories today
thoughts on McCarthy you know
how many of you have a strong feeling
about whether McCarthy would be a good
speaker in the house
do many of you have strong feelings
about that because I'm not sure how you
would get a strong feeling about that
like how would you know he would be
better than
Jim Jordan or whoever's who's whoever's
up for it how would you know
I feel like that's unknowable
now again I I hate to copy Tucker
Carlson again but let me let me credit
him for the good opinion
he basically showed he gave a nuanced
um opinion on McCarthy and I think
that's exactly right and the Nuance is
that Kevin McCarthy is really good
politically
and you need that he he did the work to
be in this position I don't like to use
the word earned it because that has no
place in politics in my opinion but we
understand what he means right he did
the work to be the person that should be
considered
that's worth saying I just don't think
it should be the deciding factor and
apparently he's great at fundraising
he's great at fundraising
the the uh the claw Adams people
uh
like what would cause you to spend time
doing this
like was that comment useful enough
that like that was worth I think I'll go
over there and
start some rumors put them on this feed
like did that pay off did you get a
little like a little dopamine hit from
there
yeah yeah clubbert
Matthew the NPC says clop Bert you know
Matthew uh that's interesting because in
my 33 years of doing Dilbert
and drawing dog Bert and ratbert you're
the first person who ever thought I can
own him by putting Bert on the end of
another word yeah nobody's ever thought
of that before I think I'll put Bert on
the end of a word and that'll be a real
clever way to to mock him
is it because you couldn't spell uh
Garfield Matthew could you not spell
Garfield the other NPC comic or NPC
comment comment that people make what's
the matter
yeah you had to go for the the most
obvious NPC one Matthew
all right Beau Bert yeah
I know you want me to swear but we don't
need to do that do we
Dewey YouTube
sensors
your plant died yesterday
[Laughter]
all right
I'm just wondering how many people come
over here just to say clot
there's a whole cohort of people
who I think they're masturbating when
they do it but I don't know that's just
a guess they come over here and they get
insane amount of fun
from writing clot
class Birds
Club Adams vax Adams clot clotting clap
clap
how about clotting and Clapper and
they'll do it the entire program
and I think to myself
there must be some payoff for that right
there there must be a payoff for it
because they wouldn't do it
I'm just finding all the people to hide
when did you start believing long
coveted was real never
when did you start uh believing uh
when did you start being an NPC
so you'll notice that the NPCs always
have the same problem they think there
are two World Views
and if they don't recognize you fitting
into the one you must be in the other
that was the payoff
oh okay so I got an answer so the uh the
trolls say the payoff was giving them
attention
so somebody's happy I that I called them
out to give them attention now is your
life that small
is your life so small
that bothering a celebrity
or let's say a public public person uh
is public bothering a public person
to disrupt the quality of the experience
did that give you actually like a little
thrill
so making making a whole bunch of lives
a little less good
was actually gave you a thrill
because you know if that's true and
apparently you're admitting it is
red here so more people coming in to do
it now if that's true and obviously it
is
you should examine uh how much you suck
because I'm going to say this directly
those are people I wish would just
not be here
I was going to say something that would
get me banned on social media but let's
just say if if a
if if a meteor killed you all
uh I would not feel as badly as I do
about
DeMar
Hamlin who seemed like an awesome guy
and we all feel bad that he's in a bad
situation the the trolls however seem to
live they they feed on other people's
unhappiness
if you feed on other people's
unhappiness
I think Evolution will eventually get
rid of you but that's not up to me
and still
still the the trolls are are coming in
to say clot
that's the lowest level of entertainment
I've ever seen
aye
uh
Now My Feet on YouTube is just filled
with people uh with trolls so I can see
how many there are
all right
Clank or clot oh it's all is it all the
sticks and Hammer people coming over to
be trolls
you know I would love to actually have a
conversation with one of the trolls
wouldn't you
like to actually see a real person and
say what exactly were you trying to get
out of this
like what was the payoff here
because I'm actually kind of curious
did you hear somebody built a robot that
operates on organic matter
so that started the rumor that is going
to eat people for fuel which apparently
it could
all right all right well there's nothing
else happening today so YouTube I'm
going to turn you off in all of your
trolls and go talk to the nice people on
the uh the locals platform
where you should all be to see the extra
special stuff bye for now
best live stream ever
