good morning everybody
and welcome
to another
greatest moment of your life
it's just one after another now
and today will be special it'll be
incredible lots of stuff happening it's
all fun and if you'd like to enjoy this
experience
at the maximum rate
well all you need is a
cup or a mug or a glass of tanker
jealous just find the canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine the end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
it happens now
go
somebody ema emailed me the other day
that they have a co-worker whose actual
natural name
is brandon fell
it's probably not the only one it sounds
like it might be a common name
brandon fell
well that's his name all right i didn't
put this in my notes so i'm going to say
this first
i just saw a tweet by corey deangelis
saying that arizona and i think they're
their first state
now
has opened up their program that money
can follow students
so they can do homeschooling and charter
schools and whatever whatever
and
it's live apparently the program is live
now so parents can take the funding that
would have gone to the public school and
take it with them to a private school
that's amazing now this is the best of
america in my opinion
this is a system that's working exactly
the way it should be the states are the
laboratory
arizona wanted to go first
and
i don't know maybe in a year or two
years we'll have a pretty good idea how
it worked out
maybe two years is short i don't know
but we'll have some indications
now
is this the best idea in the world or
the worst idea
we don't know that's the beauty of it i
think it's a good idea
seems like it would be
competition and all that but you know
unintended consequences so we'll see
but that
is a really
really
big moment
in the let's say the integrity of
the republic
because as you know our school systems
are our biggest weakness right now
if we're
miseducating the youth we're not going
to have a good outcome
and fixing that's the biggest
i think the biggest challenge we have
and not that it's hard to do
it's just the most important thing to do
because if you get everybody on the same
page and they're educated and they're
doing a good job
well everything else seems to work out a
little bit better
so that's all good news
more good news oh my god it's just all
good news today
the
marvel has now started to stream
the she-hulk
so this is your marvel hulk movie in
which the new hulk is a woman you still
have the old hulk you know the obsolete
patriarchal male hulk
but we have a new improved
woke hulk
called she-hulk and i think this is
starting off a good
sort of a good pattern i'd like to see
more of this
because here they've got the pronoun for
the hulk like right in the title of the
movie so you can't get it wrong
don't you think they should do that with
with all movies going forward
like captain america
you know it could be like he captain
um
yeah i feel like we should just
you know what about uh
what are some other
movies like that uh
yeah we should just put the pronoun in
front of all he iron man or maybe they
yeah so instead of iron man it would be
iron they
or could be iron woman but my problem
with this whole thing is uh
is that it's not really woke enough
is
this is 20 22.
am i am i wrong did i get the did i get
the year wrong it's 2022.
now and i realize it takes years to
actually get a movie made
but i feel like this is already
somewhat out of step with the times
it's not nearly woke enough is it
so i'm i'm gonna skip she-hulk i'm not
gonna this will be actually the first
marvel movie that i'm not watching
because just on a principle i'm gonna
wait for lgbtq plus hulk
i wanna i wanna hulk this either
disabled
or has um something a little extra
flavor
like just being a woman
a little bit boring in 2022.
if somebody said oh i invited somebody
to party you say who'd you invite a
woman you'd be like oh that's a little
boring
oh but also she's bringing a man you're
like
god that's boring
a man and a woman
give me a little lgbtq action a little
flavor please i like a little spice
in my movies and she-hulk is just not
getting it done in 2022 you gotta ramp
it up ramp it up a little bit
well i have a category of humor that i
love which i'm going to share with you
it's called the
shortest dismissive
insult
for some reason i love it when somebody
can get the the crispest
yeah the most cutting insult in the
smallest number of words
uh i'll give you an example
um
for example if you were to say that uh
brian stelter of cnn is the poor man's
jeffrey toobin
that's good right
yeah brad salter he's the poor man's
jeffrey toobin come on you love that i
know you do i know you love that
right it's a good category of humor but
here's one from somebody on twitter
named hat
uh puniza paradise
which i think i nailed it
i think i nailed that last name
but he
he tweets about the she-hulk movie
and i just love this so this is one two
three four five words
are you ready for five words
that sum up the she-hulk movie without
ever having watched it
this is what hat gives us
this is green karen
[Laughter]
try to forget you ever heard of that
good luck
you you'll never be able to see she-hulk
again without thinking green karen
[Laughter]
is that the funniest thing you've seen
in a while
green carrot
oh
god
we'll get the liz janey and all the fun
stuff
so yesterday i fell for a hoax
which is not the first time
uh because you see stuff
when you see stuff on twitter
that looks like what you think you
expect
it's really easy to fall for it so i
fell for one yesterday for
i don't know about a minute or two
before somebody said hey that's a hoax
so i took it down
and confessed that i'd fallen for a hoax
so it was somebody had published the
so-called rules for radicals
how many of you heard of the rules for
radicals
so this is from the 60s or something and
allegedly these rules for radicals
tell the left yeah zelinsky's olinsky's
work
tell the left how to
manipulate and
i guess gaslight the public until they
can get what they want
so the the eight rules that i saw that i
retweeted
were fake ones
and the fake ones had stuff like
you know run up the debt and bankrupt
the country
and i thought to myself
now let me make a
confession here this would be my second
confession of error
in five minutes
i got a lot of them today
so
my second confession is that
although
people talk continuously about the rules
for radicals
i believed without doing research so
here's my confession part and you can
judge me you can judge me unfairly for
this if you like
or even fairly i never bothered to look
into them
so it's one of these things you hear all
the time oh these rules for radicals
they're using they're using those rules
again
and for whatever reason
i was so sure that those rules were
complete
that i never bothered to look at them
i just dismissed them as you know more
just political talk
but i finally had to look at them
because i had accidentally tweeted the
fake ones because i thought the fake
ones were proving my point
the fake ones look like
and sure enough they were they were they
were actually hoax there were fake ones
so i looked at the real ones
what do you think are the real ones
are the real ones like really powerful
work or are they just
what do you think
are the real rules for radicals powerful
plans for taking over countries or just
a bunch of
 well i looked at them
and as far as i can tell it's just
generic stuff
all right let me let me run through them
quickly i'll do this just quickly
but this is the most generic stuff i've
ever seen there's nothing here
to me is completely empty
but it could be
that these were maybe these were
groundbreaking ideas when they came out
in the 60s is that possible
but in 2022 there's nothing on here
that's even
interesting these are just completely
normal things let me give you the idea
number one
power is not only what you have but what
the enemy thinks you have
that's called bluffing
did you need the rules for radicals to
know that pretending to have more power
than you do is a good thing
well what did that add
literally every human knows that
bluffing
can be a good thing
number two never go outside the
expertise of your people well isn't that
a little bit commonsensical
you should stay with what you know
instead of talking about things you
don't know because that would embarrass
you
or it's not going to be as effective
isn't that the most basic thing you
would ever do in any domain
is to stay within your expertise of your
people not necessarily your own
but then three is whenever possible go
outside the expertise of the enemy
in other words
if you have some knowledge or expertise
they don't have use it against them did
you need to be told that
who wouldn't do that automatically
if you have some expertise and your
opponent does not
wouldn't you take advantage of that
did you need to read rules to find out
to do that
these these are the most ordinary basic
things anybody would do
how about make the enemy live up to its
own book of rules
well what's the most common thing that
politicians do they accuse the other of
being a hypocrite making the other one
live up to their own rules
the the claim of hypocrisy is the most
empty
useless thing that anybody ever used
there's no power in any of this stuff
this stuff is all inert
so far
that says ridicule is man's most potent
weapon you know so you should use
ridicule and mock your opponents
that's what everybody does
that's what everybody does and always
has
both sides mock their opponents
what what insight did we get by having
this on the list
how about a good tactic is one year
people enjoy
did you need to be told that
that people will do things they like to
do more than things they don't like to
do
was that like an
innovation in the 60s
how about seven a tactic that drags on
too long becomes a drag
well everybody knows you need to
keep your energy high
duh
keep the pressure on
duh that's everybody on every topic all
the time
the threat is usually more terrifying
than the thing itself
yes fear works as persuasion
did you need to know that scaring people
works
who in the world needed to tell you that
how about
the major premise for tactics is the
development of operations that will
maintain a constant pressure upon the
opposition
so you should have an organization that
keeps the pressure on
again
did you need to know
that if you're organizing you need an
organization
there's nothing here
how about the last one
if you push a negative hard and deep
enough it will break through
into its counterside which is based on
the principle that every positive has
its negative
all right so first of all it's just a
bunch of word salad obvious stuff
about
if you push a negative hard enough it'll
make a difference
well everybody knows that if you if you
accuse your
opponent of something long enough and
hard enough this starts
starts working
that's both sides all the time number 12
right now 212s no number 12 the price of
a successful attack is a constructive
alternative
all right that doesn't even mean
anything
the price of a successful attack is a
constructive alternative
literally means nothing
number 13. pick the target freeze it
personalize it and polarize it
so here he's saying you know if you have
a
if you have a
political policy topic
you should put a person on it so you can
attack the person which is what
everybody does
every one of these rules for radicals is
what every politician does in every
situation there isn't a single thing
here that's even the least bit
interesting
am i wrong did you hear anything on this
list that you said oh
now we're in trouble they've seen these
rules
this is completely nonsense
it's completely useless
twaddle and i can't believe anybody
would need to read these to know to do
these things
demonize your opponent
oh it's very good that somebody told me
to do that i never would have thought of
that
this is literally npc um
programming
because every npc
in other words somebody what
didn't even have a complete brain
would know to do this stuff
all right so i'm gonna stick with my it
was um
i've seen people compare kabul harris to
the boss from dilbert
yeah i told you eventually every story
comes back to me even if i don't want it
to
i want to see if i can find uh
her
latest word salad
it's a beauty if you haven't heard it
pretty sure i can find it
we know that we really are quite behind
in terms of maximizing our collective
understanding about how we will engage
on the technology of today
and what we can quickly and easily
predict will be the technology over the
next decades
so to maintain our position as the
united states of america on this issue
it is critical that we work together
to understand where we are
to recognize and have the courage to
speak truth about what is obsolete
and then to partner
to ensure that we are speaking the same
language
with the same motivation
inspired
by the opportunity of it all
but then doing the work of updating
how we've been talking and thinking
about
our exploration and space
we know that we really are quite
now
do you think it's fair to compare her to
the pointy haired boss in the dilbert
comic strip
do you feel that
maybe that's not too far off is it
wow
you know it's funny because
um every time i see one of these clips i
think to myself well she's going to
tighten up her speaking after that
you know because she's not going to want
to do this word salad again but didn't
you hear that her speechwriter quit
can you do a fact check didn't her or
was it her communications hat or a
speechwriter
like whoever was in charge of helping
her
speak better quit
i'm thinking how could you ever get
another job after that
imagine putting on your resume
kabla harris's speechwriter
sounds like a punchline doesn't it
i mean seriously imagine looking at you
know you've got a job applicant yeah
let's see your last job was let me see
you were
kamal harris's speechwriter
i think we're done here
the door's over there
all right
uh germany has decided to uh postpone
closing its last three nuclear plants
now this is an update on the story they
had already decided to keep open some
some other ones but now i think
three more
so germany is really getting
a lot of religion on nuclear power
as they should and michael
schellenberger and his team did a lot of
uh
a lot of persuasion on this one so they
get the win
they get the win
all right so liz chaney lost her primary
to
a trump endorsed
candidate i guess she won about she lost
about two to one it wasn't close
so she had won her prior elections by
overwhelming
majorities but she just got slaughtered
now how is the news covering it
well cnn says that that
it's more signed that it's it's trump's
party
and that uh
eight of the ten republicans who voted
to impeach trump
ended up losing
or having to retire or something
okay so that's cnn's
uh
thank you and i'm thinking
is it
is it a hundred percent because liz
cheney
uh
wanted to
impeach trump
is that the only problem with liz cheney
is that she went after trump
because
to me it looks like there's some liz
cheney problems here that have to be
addressed
i'm not sure
that she did anything but some kind of
weird personal vendetta
to you know self and
aggrandize
i mean there's nothing about why she did
that even seems you know laudable at all
you know she was trying to do the i'm
above it all and i'm better than you
republicans it completely failed because
she ended up uh
being a puppet for one of the biggest
hoaxes
so the january 6th thing i'm just going
to call hoax
because i think that's fair enough
yeah at least in terms of it being an
organized insurrection
that part's a hoax
and so
so she basically got taken down by the
the democrats
the democrats basically attached to
their giant hoax and they guaranteed
that she was going to lose her job
so which was
i suppose maybe kind of clever of them
in some weird way
but to me liz janey of course she will
keep on the fight they always say that
but i feel like she's captain ahab and
moby dick
i feel like she's just chasing her own
personal white whale
that happens to be an orange whale in
this case great orange whale
and
god i want to say a word i don't want to
say but i'm not going to do it
let's just say that liz cheney may have
come across as not a
a person that you want to support
that's the best i can do
well cnn did this uh
great gaslighting piece
uh as
part of their ongoing
hypnotizing of the public
it seems to only work on their base so
listen to this so cnn attended a
hacker's convention
in which part of the hacker convention
was they had access to a bunch of voting
machine
hardware and software
and then the hackers were going to look
for vulnerabilities
in the voting machine software
now how do you think how do you think
cnn would cover a story
about hackers looking for
vulnerabilities in voting machines how
would they handle that because it would
be counter to their narrative
to say that the voting machines have
vulnerabilities
but on the other hand
that is the main context of the story
because the hackers did in fact find
vulnerabilities now there wasn't much
detail about those vulnerabilities but
even cnn reported
yes
we found vulnerabilities
here's how cnn reported it hey hacker
guy
whose only expertise is hacking
was were there any vulnerabilities yes
did you find any evidence that those
vulnerabilities were exploited to change
the election
hacker guy says no no
absolutely not no evidence that anything
bad happened in the election absolutely
not
what's wrong with that
here's what's wrong with it
how are they going to find evidence that
the election had been hacked
by looking at
unconnected machines
sitting on a table
how is he going to look at a clean
voting machine with no data on it
and determined that the election had
been rigged by looking at a machine that
may not have ever been part of the
voting process
ridiculous
but the way they presented it was that
he was talking with some authority that
they had told that they could determine
through their hacking skills
that these were that had not been hacked
so it wasn't so they could determine for
sure that it was hackable
and that seems to be you know something
nobody's
nobody's arguing about
but then they went to the point where
they fooled you into thinking this guy
could tell
that no nothing had happened in the
actual election
by looking at a piece of equipment which
in all likelihoods had never been near
an election
it probably was an extra one that the
the voting company gave them
well let me ask you that where do you
think they got them
do you think they got the spare voting
machines from let's say counties that
use them
did they go to a county and say do you
have an extra
that we can just use and take apart
maybe i don't know or do you think it's
more likely they went to the voting
machine companies themselves and said
could you give us a
give us a blank that we can play with
and if it came from the voting machine
companies themselves
would it necessarily look exactly like
the ones that were in the election
and and let me ask you this
do you think there's one version of
voting machine out there
isn't there all kinds of different
software
uh versions
what software version got tested
because i imagine that every voting
machine had exactly one version of
software on it
don't you think that there are you know
dozens of software patches and versions
all along the way
they probably saw the most recent
software wouldn't you say
i assumed that these had software on
them of course
so
did the hackers see the software
version that was in the election or did
they see the most
modern software version which one
assumes might have some patches of it
who knows updates
there is absolutely nothing about this
that tells you whether or not the
election was rigged
it just tells you that it was totally
possible
and that here's the story that makes me
crazy
what is the most likely way an election
would be rigged electronically
what is the most likely way is the most
likely way an outside
an outside hacker gets into the system
is that the most likely way
it's not but we keep talking about it
like it is
the most likely way by a factor of i
don't know
a hundred to one twenty to one i mean
it's not even close
the most likely way it would happen was
an insider
now what can they tell us did the
hackers test on the insiders
did the hackers put any you know devices
into the the skull of all the employees
who have access to the data and say we
checked your brain and we don't see that
you did anything
there's no way to check that
so the biggest risk we completely ignore
because we don't have a way to check
right
so so we look at the shiny object oh
hackers
hackers are trying to break in but
meanwhile the biggest risk is always
just some guy
or some woman
always
it's always the biggest doesn't mean it
happened it just means that's always the
biggest risk
all right
so that
it's amazing that that happens right in
front of us
so
i had some vague
vague understanding that that whole
gretchen whitmer governor
uh
might be kidnapped plot by the
extremists and i didn't know the whole
story but apparently the story is that
it was a complete set up by
one fbi agent who probably coerced some
others but primarily one fbi agent who
had some outside security business
interests
seemed to have been trying to
create the impression
that the extremist risk was higher than
it was probably for his own income
meaning it wasn't some kind of a an fbi
plot it was one guy in the fbi who
looked like he could make some money
by you know making it look like there's
a threat and then he could
presumably
pay to take care of the threat that he
had created
so
they did
everything they could to convince some
regular people who did not want to
kidnap anybody to get involved in this
plot and now because it's in a court
we have uh really good evidence
proof you could say because it's going
through the court system
uh that an fbi agent was behind a whole
fake hoax kidnap plot
and that really happened
that's that's not something made up
and part of the story which is
interesting is that
the fbi one fbi did talk to the local
police
when the protests happened and asked
them to stand aside and let the
protesters
enter the capitol building
so at the same time that we're wondering
if the january 6th thing had anything
sketchy
about it
we see
an exact model
in the real world
of what people suspected was happening
with january 6.
now i'm not going to allege that january
6 was an fbi operation
so
i don't have that information
but when you look at one that was an fbi
operation
and you look at the parallels you have
to start
asking some questions
but there is one part that you shouldn't
lose sight of that the this lansing
michigan kidnap plot
the kidnap plot
really seems to be run by one person
as opposed to the fbi
so there there's no evidence that i've
seen that the fbi as an organization was
trying to do this it seemed more like
one person
so you'd have to take that to the
january 6 protest and say to yourself
could it be that one or more persons
is all it took
to
make it look like an fbi plot
it wouldn't take much if it only takes
one or two people
to to motivate other people to look like
a plot
so
given that that happened it's hard for
me to imagine
that you could completely dismiss
the possibility that the fbi was
involved
again i don't have any information that
would suggest they were
well suggest is the wrong word i don't
have any proof that they were
but man
it goes right to the top of your
possibility list doesn't it
it goes right to the top of the
possibility list
rasmussen did a poll on asking people if
they trusted lawyers
and only 35 percent of american adults
trust lawyers
but here's the fun part
of the people who had actually hired
lawyers and had experience with lawyers
the more experience you had with a
lawyer the less you trusted lawyers
so if you had never hired a lawyer you
were more likely to trust
them um
so that tells you something but i feel
like people trust their own lawyer more
than they trust
other people's lawyers
i generally trust my own lawyer
but i always think the other lawyers are
i can't trust them but of course it's a
it's a system where you're not supposed
to trust the other side all right
uh elon musk made some news by saying
that he was uh basically in the middle
politically so he was on the right side
of the democrats on the left side of
republicans meaning meaning he was he's
in the middle
and then he also announced he's
buying manchester united
the most famous soccer team in the world
soccer club
um
but
here's a if somebody would like to take
over america let me tell you how to do
it
all right here's
if you want to actually take over
america
you want to do it joe manchin style
you want to have a situation where the
democrats and the republicans are so so
close
that a third party would always
determine who won
so you create the third party and here's
what you could now the third parties
have existed but the problem with third
parties so far
is that they're obviously left or
obviously right
am i right so you could always tell who
they're taking votes away from
so if if you always know who the third
party is going to take votes from let's
say the green party takes from the left
then you don't really have power except
to be a spoiler
you want to be like joe manchin
where nobody would knows which way
you're going to go
so here's what i would call a center
party if i were to create one to run the
world
i would call it the common center party
the common
party
what does common center remind you of
common sense
your brain just goes to common sense and
what does the center
generally represent
common sense
right and the center is where most
people believe they are
and they believe it's common
and they believe that they'd like you to
know it's common
right
if you belong to the biggest group in
america
and you're being ignored because the the
far left and the far right get all the
attention you probably want people to
know hey
we're here
we're common we're in the middle
so if you called yourself the common
center party and started a political
party and you made sure that sometimes
you lean left and sometimes you lean the
little right
you would have a joe manchin situation
where you could control politics
all you need to do
is cannibalize one side a little bit
harder than the other and you could
determine who the president would be
so let's say you wanted let's say you
wanted trump to lose
you wanted trump to lose if you're in
the center then you say okay the center
wants to have stronger immigration
so suddenly all the people who think
trump is too extreme
but they like strong
immigration policy they go oh the center
party
you know that's that's for me
and then that center party could make
the left win
because they'd take away too many of the
votes from the right but it could go the
other way
so you could have somebody
from the left but i'm gonna do it with
nuclear
presumably no these are just examples
but presumably you could you could
manage your campaign
intentionally to take a little more from
the left or a little more from the right
and in so doing you would become joe
manchin and you would run run the
country effectively
because you get to decide who the
president was
am i wrong
now it would split the party if you were
exactly identical to both sides but the
whole the whole thing here is to be joe
manchin
and to clearly push one way or clearly
push the other way when you want to
influence things
now we'll see
uh my last point i have to save for the
locals platform because
it's an idea which
would be too dangerous in the public
too dangerous
true story
um so after i turn off uh youtube this
morning i'll give the
uh locals people a little extra
i love you too i love you too on on
youtube
um how many of you saw the clip that was
taken out of
my recent
cast
it was just a clip about the the hoax
pattern
seems to be getting a lot of uptick i
saw jack passabek tweeted it
a number of other people i feel like
it's making a difference do you
does anybody think that my
by by calling out the hoax pattern
i feel like it could make a difference
yeah there's something powerful about
writing it down
because i've been
well lots of people had been pointing
out that the democrats used the same
pattern over and over but it's not until
you write it down or make a picture of
it
that it becomes
you know potent
so maybe that's the part i did i just
made a picture and that made it potent
all right
you wish i still blogged yeah
i i kind of wish i did too i do think
that maybe my blogging
has more uh impact because it's more
portable if i say something in a blog
post it gets passed around more easily
all right
that's all for now and um
oh the the two hoaxes that i added to
the oh and let me ask you this do you
think my list of now it's 14 my list of
14 hoaxes
do you think that that's making a dent
i think it might be
now the trouble is is not being fully
exposed to the other side
uh
and
yeah
so so my real problem is i don't really
break through to the other side but on
twitter you can see that when i when i
paste the hoax
that people immediately just
sort of collapse
and you'll see a number of people say
every one of those things is true
and i think to myself really
really
there's even one person who thinks
everything on the list actually really
happened and they'll say that in public
and i think well okay you can't find one
thing on that list
even the things that the court has shown
as hoaxes okay
all right
uh youtube
i'm sure this is the finest thing you've
seen this morning it will stay with you
for the rest of your days
uh but i got a little talking to do to
the locals people i'm gonna go do that
and
um
let me just one one technical note
if you listen to the podcast and you saw
it was um all chopped up
uh or you listen to
the
um i guess it's the podcast chopped up
for reasons that i don't understand yet
some of my content can't be downloaded
from youtube
on most days
it can be downloaded and then turned
into podcasts you know the audio part
but
for reasons i don't yet understand
youtube will block some all day long
there'll be technical glitches and you
can't download it i don't know if i
don't know if this affects everybody
or just my account
but those that seem the most let's say
impactful
and this is anecdotal but the ones that
seem most impactful like
you know the the hoax pattern i feel
like those are highly correlated with
when i get a technical glitch
so that i can't
i can't transmit it
i also had
two tweets yesterday that
under normal days would have been close
to a thousand retweets but capped out at
like a hundred to two hundred
and they were both pretty dangerous
dangerous in the sense that they
questioned the narrative
and
to me it looks like they were just
obviously throttled
but of course we're deep into
confirmation biased territory right
my confirmation bias says
if i do a tweet that i think is good but
other people don't
i'm going to think it was throttled
instead of thinking it was a bad tweet
so i have to you know i have to keep a
little bit of
honesty on my
on myself
so i don't know
i'll tell you it looks exactly like it's
being throttled
but i don't know there's no way to know
that
all right
and that ladies and gentlemen is all i
have for
youtube
and i'll be talking to locals in a
minute
bye for now
