come on in come on in
do you know what it's time for

okay
all right well there would be a little
change there's a little bit of a change
today
i've been told that the simultaneous sip
is no longer allowed
and i'm not questioning it it's been
replaced with a new pledge
a pledge of allegiance to the official
narrative
and i'm hoping you can join me
in this pledge i'd like all of you to
join along
let me read it to you first and then
we'll do the actual pledge
you can find this in my twitter feed
at uh today at uh 6 41am this would be
several tweets down
and if you'd like to join in the
pledge
of allegiance to the official narrative
it goes like this
i pledge allegiance to the official
narrative and i affirm that our election
systems are the only digital systems
that are
100 immune from hacking
i further affirmed that there
there was no election fraud of any kind
because we are not allowed to check a
man and a woman so that's the pledge
please join me now
this will be replacing the simultaneous
sip at least for this morning maybe
forever because this is more important
than anything else you're doing
stan please please stand
you don't want to sit for this
i need some respect
please stand for the pledge of
allegiance to the official narrative
put your hand over your heart it's
optional but i think it's respectful
and i'll lead you now in the pledge
i pledge allegiance to the official
narrative and i affirm that our election
systems are the only digital systems
that are 100 percent immune from hacking
i further affirmed that there was no
election fraud of any kind because we
are not allowed to check
amen and a woman
and now
and now you may take
the sip
which is the
wait a minute i'm getting another
message
i can't say that word
it's just called the official sip now
i used to call this something else but
we don't use that term anymore this is
just the official narrative sip
i don't know if it's going to taste the
same honestly
but you can try it let's do it together
see if it tastes as good as the
simultaneous sip i'm a little worried
oh my god
did you taste that at home
oh
god i'm throwing this cup away
i don't know what got into that but it's
bitter as hell
well let's talk about the news that
we're allowed to talk about
um there's a big up outbreak of
coronavirus in china i guess beijing is
locking down pretty hard
and here's the question that i ask you
about
are there still people saying they can't
hear
i i think i'll just delete all the
people who say they can't hear
seriously
are you actually saying that you can't
hear on youtube
that's not real is it
all right
uh your mic on youtube is off huh
my microphone is on my microphone is
plugged in
yes it is
uh is there anybody who can hear
unbelievable i'm actually
apparently i have technical problems on
uh on youtube
all right youtube
we're gonna turn you off then goodbye
alright so youtube's dead
we'll just periscope this one
hello periscope
too bad youtube
for whatever reason doesn't work today
but uh
i'm sure i'm sure we can carry on all
right let's talk about
china
uh so they've got an outbreak
and here's the thing i wonder
was there any chance that wasn't gonna
happen
it doesn't it doesn't feel like there
was any chance that china wouldn't have
a major outbreak
no matter what they had done
uh so this is the least surprising thing
in the world
but it also makes me wonder if our
intelligence agencies ever thought to
themselves
i wonder if we should just spread a
little coronavirus around beijing
now i don't think they did that
but do you think they talked about it
because i got a feeling they talked
about it
that would just be part of the job i
would think
uh twitter stock is down about ten
percent or nine percent when i just
checked a minute ago
full disclosure
i do own twitter stock
do you uh
do you have a problem with that
so let me tell you why i own twitter
stock
i i like to own stock
in a company that's so powerful
it can ban the president of the united
states and
here's the good part
and make its competitor go away
just go away
twitter just did that just banned the
president of the united states
and then made their competition parlor
just go away i mean i don't think they
did it directly but you know parlor went
away
so
i don't give investment advice
and and if you had bought
twitter on my advice if i had given it i
didn't give this advice but if i told
you last week to buy it you'd be down 10
so don't take any investment advice on
specific companies
from me that would be a bad idea okay
that said
let me give you general investment
advice and then you can apply it to
whatever company you want but it's
general advice not about twitter
if you find a company that's so powerful
it can ban the president and get rid of
its competition in the same week
that's probably a good investment
take a
you know take any of the big big tech
companies that have a dominant
dominant foothold right now
there's nothing
there's almost nothing that you can do
those companies are pretty well
entrenched
so investment wise
any company that has that much power
looks pretty good
so
i'm just going to tell you i won't be
selling my twitter stock
um
because nothing changed from the moment
i bought it one of the things that uh
i think it was warren buffett teaches is
if you buy a stock don't sell it until
the reason you bought it in the first
place changes
now of course will be exceptions to that
but as a general rule the reason i
bought twitter is that
there's no competition
that's why i bought it i bought it
because there isn't really any
competition
and did that change
nope
nope still no competition not really
so
i'll hold on to that even though you
don't like that um
so
let's talk about the uh
conspiracy theory rumors that the
president has or will sign the something
called the insurrection act
which i don't know the details but i
guess it would be like
a little like martial law e that
he could employ the military to stay in
power or something like that
let me tell you this
if there's anybody watching this who
believes that the president has or would
or will
sign something called an insurrection
act
remember what i'm telling you right now
i'm telling you there's a 100 chance
that's not true
not a 99 chance
100 chance that's not true
now
wait a few weeks
and then review
remember that i told you this
if it turns out i'm right
i'm right
look at what you believed
and then look what i told you
and then see which one of us got this
right
if you got it wrong and you were sure
that you believe the internet that
there's some kind of insurrection
act being signed
just remember i told you it wasn't true
so that the next time there's a question
about hey is this thing true or not
you should at the very least
check with me first
or other people that you trust
i'm not the only person telling you that
the insurrection act thing is not true
look at anybody else who's telling you
that
i mean i haven't looked at
the you know i have not checked let's
say mike cernovich's twitter feed
i don't know what he said about it
but
i can guess
i can guess
that he's saying it's not real
have it you know you can name five other
people that you know on twitter
check their twitter feeds if they're
talking about this
they will tell you it's not real
and these are people that you trust
so just keep keep track and when you are
wrong about this later
look to the people who are right for
your future opinions
there is a bad case of what i will call
qds instead of tds which is trump
derangement system syndrome
the q phenomenon has created a
cognitive dissonance trigger
the likes of which
we haven't seen since 2016.
i told you when trump got elected that
people's brains would just break
because they wouldn't be able to hold in
their head everything they believed to
be true
at the same time he gets elected
because that would be so completely
different from everything they believed
about reality
crack their brains couldn't hold the two
conflicting thoughts
wait a minute everything i think about
trump if that's true
he couldn't possibly get oh yeah he did
get elected so that's what triggers
cognitive dissonance to
to uh
thoughts that can't be held at the same
time so you need some weird like a
hallucination to paper together the two
thoughts now their hallucination was
russia collusion
so that was how they papered over the
fact that trump couldn't get elected but
he did
ah there must have been some
russian collusion
now the q people are in the same
situation
the q people are finding out that
everything that they've ever been told
about q
isn't happening
so they are learning that that deeply
held beliefs really strongly held
beliefs
clearly are not true because now we'll
observe that there's no
mass arrests of the deep state
will observe that trump didn't have some
plan he's implementing will observe
that there is no insurrection act so
after you've observed all of the things
that you believe for four years i guess
in cases
all of it not being true
what would be the predictable outcome
of their minds
well it's this setup is unmistakable
they they have a belief
it will be violated in the most
aggressive way because reality is not
going to serve up anything close to what
they imagined was going to happen and
they will have to invent a
hallucination
like the like the russia collusion hoax
they will need to paper over this
impossibility
that q is right at the same time that
none of it happens
and what will that hallucination be
the hallucination will be
something you can't even imagine
because did you think the russia
collusion thing would i mean that just
came out of nowhere right
i mean i'm sure it was part of a plan by
some people to
to put forth that idea
but you didn't see it coming
and whatever happens to the people with
the q brains and their cognitive
dissonance which is going to be extreme
now it's going to be really extreme
you don't know what that's going to do
but a whole lot of people are going to
be
flipping
out um so i don't if you're just joining
i don't know what was wrong with the
youtube feed but people said the sound
didn't work so i just turned it off
um
then somebody says why is twitter
suspending all accounts
mentioning q
because they can
they can
you know did i tell you that the reason
that i own twitter stock is that they're
so powerful they can basically decide
what free speech is now
remember the exception to free speech
used to be
you can't yell fire in a crowded theater
now the reason for that is that that
would be dangerous people would try to
run out of the theater and they'd
trample each other and if there if
there's not a fire
it's pretty bad example of using speech
but now we've added to that example you
can't yell fire in the crowded theater
and this is not a joke there's no
hyperbole here we've added to that
example
you can't question a an election
after it's certified
now i suppose you could question it
before it's certified but after it's
certified
that's our new exception to freedom of
speech
for all practical purposes
right
now uh by the way somebody said
twitter's down 6.4 percent now so it
started down 10 and now it's down 6
percent
do you know what these smart investors
just said to themselves
are you serious if somebody's going to
give this stock to be at a 10 discount
i'll take it
six percent discount on twitter stock
today
i hate to tell you but it's a bargain no
i don't take that back because that
sounds like a stock recommendation
reverse that there were there were no
stock recommendations in this live
stream
you should not listen to me for stock
recommendations all right
so
uh
let's see the proud boy leader nicholas
oakes ox so apparently he shared an
image of himself on social media
smoking a cigarette in the capitol last
week and he was arrested in hawaii
but he's claiming that he took part in
the raid as a professional journalist
i don't think that's going to go too far
but it's good that he has some kind of a
defense i suppose
don't you wonder what he was thinking
when the head of the proud boys were
standing in the capitol building
smoking a cigarette and taking a selfie
did he think
did he think that
that was going to be fine
what did he think
yeah what do you think somebody said
amazon is down today but i wouldn't
worry about amazon's future either
they've got a pretty good situation
going there
so i just have to wonder what was in the
heads of the people who did this now
some of them were
murderous killers
we've learned
some of them were just patriots
but
i would love to know what was going
through the head of somebody who thought
they could smoke a cigarette in the
capitol
after you know
getting in the way they got in
taking a picture of themselves and
thinking that would be fine
i guess they thought it would be fine
what the hell was wrong with
that um we've all now seen i think
you've all seen the video the horrendous
video of the protesters
dragging a police officer out of a
doorway
and beating him with american flag and
other
blunt objects we see that police officer
laying motionlessly on the ground after
being beaten
some of you are disagreeing about the
fact check about whether he died or or
that somebody else died or was that
actually showing him being killed or
just injured so there's a little
question there
but here's what i said about it once
you've seen the video
of the crowd
either killing or attempting to kill it
was at least attempted murder
it was either murder or attempted murder
one of those
after seeing that i would say that the
the law enforcement officer who opened
fire and shot shot the woman who was
coming through the broken window
through the neck and killed her i would
say
he's
that was a clean shoot
now i say that because if somebody is
dragging police officers out and beating
them in an organized
crowd way
and you're a police officer and that
crowd is ten feet away from you and
heading toward you
and they've just beaten to death or
attempted to beat to death a police
officer the same job you have
and they're right there
do you have the ability to shoot
the answer is yes
yeah you do
if somebody just murdered
one of your kind
and it's the same you know crowd
composition it's not the same exact
people but the composition for the same
reason on the same day
yeah you can shoot the first person
through the through the class
now on twitter when i said this people
said to me scott there's no evidence
that the cop who did the shooting
was even aware
that this other cop had been murdered or
almost murdered whichever it was
you know in a different area in the
capitol
to which i say
that makes no difference
why does that matter why does it matter
if the cop who fired
was aware
that
somebody in his job had just been beaten
to death or near death
why does that matter
because he made the right decision
now whether he knew about that or didn't
know about it
doesn't matter if he knew about it or
didn't know about it he made the right
decision
because we know about it
the fact that you and i know about it
now
means that he made the right decision
he was operating in the fog of war he
had a decision to make
that put himself at great personal risk
because you know if you take the shot
you personally are at great personal
risk
and
he did it in the fog of war not knowing
if it was the right thing or the wrong
thing but he took a personal risk
in his effort to protect the vice
president et cetera
and in retrospect he was right
because
he perceived the situation as a
immediate deadly threat
one assumes he did i mean i can't read
his mind but one assumes he did because
he took the shot and it looked like a
controlled
intelligent thought i was shot
so it doesn't matter
doesn't matter if he knew about the
other violence
they were a violent crowd exactly the
way
his treatment of them would suggest they
were
so i would say that that police officer
who was i think suspended
when you get suspended
there's a cloud over you that there's an
assumption
a default assumption that maybe you did
something wrong there's still a maybe
but doesn't it feel a little bit more
like we think you did something wrong
i feel as if the suspension or whatever
they've done to him
should be immediately reversed
because based on what we've all seen
the clear default assumption is that it
was a
an appropriate shooting
tragedy
the woman who got shot i want to say
this as clearly as possible
didn't deserve to get shot
so the individual who got shot we all
agree should not have been shot
but the larger decision of how do you
stop a crowd
yeah that looked like
good police work to me now
could it be that he did actually do
something that's illegal or
inappropriate and he should be punished
maybe
but i haven't seen it
i haven't seen anything like that i feel
as though the appropriate treatment for
that law enforcement officer
is to give him the benefit of a doubt
until there's some evidence
which i haven't seen
that he acted inappropriately
now somebody else on twitter said to be
scott
there is never a reason to shoot into a
crowd
especially when the people that you can
see visibly are not armed with deadly
weapons
do you do you believe that
that there's never a reason to shoot
into a crowd
well i said to the person who tweeted
i like i think you should tell your wife
that if there's an angry crowd
surrounding your home
that you will not shoot into the crowd
you would let them come into the home
and kill your wife
that would be your choice
but i want to tell you that your wife
might be interested
to know that if i were protecting my
wife
and let's say an angry crowd that i
believed had weapons and meant me harm
was surrounding the house
i'm just going to put
my strategy on it
if an angry crowd of men women and
children
surround my house and i have a belief
that they're going to do harm to my wife
i will slay every one of them men women
and children
now
that's just me
now this this assumes that that i know
the danger is real
but apparently this person wants to tell
his wife that he would let her die
at the hands of the crowd
because there is no reason to shoot into
a crowd
i guess that's one way to look at it
but my wife's gonna be alive and
yours won't
so
you might want to explain that to her
um
of course i would go to jail in either
case but at least my wife would be alive
um so here's a three lev three layers
down of reality on this story about
lynnwood apparently he's been banned
from twitter as a lot of people have
been
uh for
for calling for mike pence to face a
firing squad
he actually said that
now
there are some bands
that look uh unreasonable to me
but this isn't one of them
if you call for the vice president
to be the subject of a firing squad when
the vice president has done literally
nothing wrong
literally nothing wrong
yeah that might be reason to ban you
from something
you know
uh i suppose the free speech extremist
would still say yeah but even so
well i don't know
yeah i don't at least it wouldn't bother
me if somebody got banned for something
like that
but here's
the three layers down analysis
on the top layer it just looks like a
lawyer who is a little bit crazy right
and then you look at sydney powell and
you say oh
looks like trump got two lawyers or a
little bit crazy a little bit crazy
that's what it looks like
but
is there more to the story
i will tell you that early on in this
saga when we first heard the the wilder
allegations from
linwood and from cindy powell
that the people
who i know who know the most about how
the world works i'm being very vague
here
the people who know the most about how
the world works
interpret that any way you want
but you should assume that these are
people who have been
part of that world
right not people who imagine what it's
like
but people who have been part of things
you know let's just say people have been
involved
in real things that maybe you're not
aware of
when this first came up they said to me
that uh it's almost certainly a
disinformation campaign
meaning that
these two lawyers linwood and sydney
powell
may have been identified
as people who would believe
conspiracy theories
because that is something that you could
figure out you could figure out from
past record who is likely to believe a
wild story
my concern is that they were identified
as people likely to believe a wild story
and that they may have been fed one
for the purpose of discrediting them
and
that looks exactly like what happened
and i need to tell you
that i was told that was happening from
the start
and that this has every
as every tell
for being some kind of either people who
are in current intelligence agencies or
have been involved or have worked with
them or have some kind of deep
experience in disinformation
as a profession
they appear to be behind feeding these
conspiracy theories to these lawyers
but
i'm not i'm not forgiving the lawyers
i believe that they might have been
targeted because they might have been
perceived as
people who would believe things
so i'm just speculating i don't have any
direct evidence of any of that
i'm just saying that people told me this
was what was happening in the beginning
and there are people who would know
and um but well they would know just by
the tells not because they had personal
information
and
that's what it looks like to me
to me it looks like a disinformation
campaign that was 100 successful we'll
never know
that's just speculation
all right
um
so apparently the company cumulus media
which i guess is the employer for uh
mark levin ben shapiro dan bongino
etc has told its on-air personalities
this is a report i don't know if it's
true
i don't think you could assume this is
true just because it's in the news
but
um
and just because it's in the news
so
by the way i'll uh i'll play back the uh
youtube and see if if the audio was okay
if it is okay then i'll just never
listen to anybody who says there's an
audio problem i'll just
you know just pour through it but every
now and then there actually is an audio
problem so it's confusing
um
all right so what do you think about the
fact that uh
cumulus media is telling their on-air
people allegedly that's the story i
don't know how truthful this is
that they can't talk about certain
topics
so over here i'm seeing people say that
was the audio was fine and other people
saying there was a problem
uh sounded like room audio
so it probably sounded like my
microphone wasn't working
i'll look into that
all right um
so
here's my take on what trump did and i i
feel as though
uh just putting it in the cleanest
simple form has some value so
you already know my opinion but putting
it simply helps and it's like this
uh
there's nothing wrong with inspiring
people to protest against an election
result
which you think was non-transparent
so if all you're doing is saying hey i
think we should look into this
reelection the result and it was a
peaceful
if it had been a peaceful protest nobody
would have a problem with that
um
but
and
but we'd also all agree that inciting an
insurrection
would be a bad thing so i think there
are two things we all agree on
peaceful protest
over an election result and transparency
of the election
probably all good as long as it doesn't
turn violent
and at the same time we would all agree
that directly inciting an insurrection
especially if you're a sitting president
would be really bad
especially if there was no election
irregularity
but here's the thing
that distinction
requires the public to know the
difference
but what if the public or too many of
the public it doesn't have to be the
whole public but what if too many of the
public can't tell the difference
between being asked to do a for a safe
non-violent protest
and a an insurrection
because that's what happened
there were apparently there were a
number of people who couldn't tell the
difference
between yeah let's go protest
and our voice will be heard and let's
have a violent insurrection against the
president
or against the vice president i guess
now
if the public could tell the difference
between those two things a peaceful
protest
inspiration versus
inspiring a
violent takeover if all of the public
knew that those were different things
then everything the president did was
fine
he didn't do a thing wrong
if the public
could tell the difference
but they can't
they can't tell the difference
apparently
there are plenty of people who think
go protest
means a signal to overthrow the
government now
should trump have known that
should trump have known
that saying the right thing
which is go protest
the right thing according to his opinion
could should trump have known that doing
the right thing let's go protest you
assume it's peaceful
would lead to the wrong thing some
people thinking that they should go do
bad things and the answer is i think so
i think trump should have known
that the public would not be smart
enough
to make that distinction
and that it would cause trouble
but here's the problem can we ever have
street protests again
because is anybody telling that the
leaders of black lives matter that they
should step down
because their protest led to some some
members of the group
being bad actors and doing bad things
and people got hurt
so are we asking the same thing of black
lives matter that their leaders should
take responsibility for all the
the danger
because wouldn't you say that black
lives matter could know with a hundred
percent certainty
certainly after the first few nights
they could know with complete certainty
that continuing this straight protest
would lead to
more damage and death and injury of
course they would
so why are they not
just as on the spot as trump is in both
cases
they would know if black lives matter
had said
yeah we're going to be peaceful but you
know
uh protests that make you uncomfortable
or the good ones
and you know
nothing really good ever happened
without a little bit of violence
you know if black lives matter leaders
are saying stuff like that
are they not fully responsibility for
every violent thing that came out of the
uh and of what was mostly peaceful
same standard i just think you have to
apply the same standard
that said
if the leaders of black lives matter had
been president of the united states
and they had encouraged what would be
let's say a a justified
protest
justified in the sense that there are
real concerns about police action
against
black citizens
so no matter what you think about the
actual data or what you think about that
it's a real concern
right and i don't ignore
something that is that much of a concern
by my fellow citizens even if i think
you know i would i would look at it a
little differently the concern itself
is fully worth the consideration right
because that's just respect
it wouldn't matter who it was or what
their complaint was
if they're really really bothered by it
to the point where living in this
country is a problem
i think you got to address it so
if black lives matter leaders had been
president and said hey go do some
peaceful protests
uh and then
people got killed
because they're not all peaceful some
bad elements will join
what happens if you keep doing it
and then the next night you say yeah go
do it again and somebody gets hurt again
and then the third night you say yeah go
do it again
somebody gets hurt again
well i think you would ask the
the in this hypothetical imaginary
situation you would ask the head of
black lives matter who in my imaginary
situation is also the president you'd
ask them to step down
wouldn't you
but here's the bigger question
now that we know that every kind of
street protest will inevitably
be
let's say
will be taken over by the bad elements
if you had a protest tomorrow
there was a street protest with lots of
energy
it wouldn't matter what the topic was
bad people would join it they'd say hey
we can hide in this crowd
we'll break some windows we'll hurt some
people that we think should be hurt
so
maybe we've reached a point where we if
you have social media that works
we don't really have social media that
works at this point i would argue but in
terms of free speech
but maybe we should just
take it as a standard
that if you're an organizer of a protest
and somebody dies you're responsible
because that's what we told trump
and i don't disagree
i don't disagree
that trump has responsibility
for the deaths in the capital i think he
has responsibility but i would like to
take that concept and apply it to
everybody
i think the black lives matter leaders
have responsibility
for the deaths that came out of those
protests
now you might say the benefit of the
protest is in the long run is greater
greater than the immediate deaths and i
would listen to that argument but you
still have to take responsibility for
the deaths because if you do something
you know will result in death
if you know it
or at least injury if you know it do you
think if anti-far brings i don't know
let's say antifa brings a thousand
people to a city
do you think they don't know people are
going to get hurt of course they do
of course they do
so
i would just want to be consistent in
the standard either
the leaders are always blamed for the
deaths
or never
but you got to pick one
and i'd be i guess i'd be okay picking
either one
right
i've entered the twilight zone
somebody says kamala harris encouraged
writers she should be impeached next i
think that's completely fair
so people are saying that kamala harris
had encouraged the black lives matter
protesters and even said things that
sounded to me like she encouraged a
little bit of violence
that's the way i heard it
you know maybe the exact words don't say
that but similar to the trump situation
if i hear it that way
well that's sort of the reality if you
hear it that way that's your reality so
i think that would actually be 100
percent appropriate
that no matter whether president trump
gets impeached or not yeah i do think
kamala harris should be impeached on day
one
that's completely appropriate
because the things she said
did lead you know encouraged incited
rioting and death
i think that's perfectly appropriate
in fact i don't know if the republicans
have any ability to push with that but
i'd put it through today
there's no reason that you can't there
is no reason you can't impeach
kabul harris
for something she did before she took
office right because it was all sort of
connected to taking office it was when
she was running
so yeah i think caballeros should be
impeached
under the same theory that the president
will probably get impeached
now by the way
i don't have strong opinions about
impeachment versus
resigning versus 25th amendment versus
even just not doing anything
i feel as if
these things all became the same thing
because there's no time left
i mean i suppose the impeachment thing
i've heard that if he gets impeached can
somebody fact check this on me
is it true that if the president gets
impeached he loses his
pension and security detail
i don't know that that's true that
doesn't sound true to me
it doesn't sound true that if you're an
ex-president you don't get secret
service protection
but fact-check that for me if that were
true that would be
just the worst thing i'd heard all year
i hope it's not all right
remember when
everybody said that trump supporters
would follow him no matter what
and that if he shot somebody on fifth
avenue his supporters would still
support him
well here's the weird
and convenient thing that happened this
week
trump and he wasn't trying to do this of
course but inadvertently trump created
an off-ramp
for people like me
which is actually really convenient
so without this week
the events of this week in the the
capital stuff
uh trump would have left office and i
would just be a person who supported him
on you know 90 of everything he did from
beginning to end and then i would have
to live with that as the guy who would
support trump
who other people think is a monster no
matter what he did
no matter what he did
now if you support somebody
who other thing other people think is
hitler and you support him no matter
what he does
well you just look like hitler
so so that was what i was looking
forward to
is that trump would just leave office
and then i would be branded hitler's
helper forever and that would be the
rest of my life
but
because of the events of this past week
it makes it really easy for people like
me to say oh i'm out
okay i like those other things he did i
like the middle east the economy before
the coronavirus there's a bunch of stuff
i liked
and i can still like them just as much
as i like them before
but
this is my shooting somebody on fifth
avenue moment
and
i don't support him
when he shoots somebody on fifth avenue
and now you know for sure
because uh in this exact case i'm not
i'm not arguing against impeachment i'm
not even arguing against
uh the 25th amendment i don't know you
know
in terms of precedent or anything like
that if it's a good idea but i don't
have any stake in it i have no argument
for that and
i don't think it matters either because
in a few days he's out of office either
way
so
uh that's where i stand on that
um
apparently the pga of america
they're even canceling their uh golf
tournament that was at the one of the
trump properties
i don't know how the trump
family
is going to avoid total economic
destruction
and i don't think that is fair
that is deeply unfair because
i don't believe at least you know the
trump family i don't believe that they
had anything in mind except helping the
country and you know getting a good
outcome and it looks like
they will be uh punished for trying to
help the country by a complete
destruction of their brand now you could
you say that president trump was
responsible for that and i wouldn't
argue that
um
all right
that
is what i want to say
yeah and so i'm seeing that in the uh
in the comments people are saying that
uh you've got to cover your ass
cover your ass
now what i'm saying to you is that
trump inadvertently created a situation
where you can cover your ass
but also be completely honest and
transparent
i'm not lying when i say
that trump did something very bad this
week and if people want to impeach him
for it i'm not going to argue with it
does that sound like a lie
do i sound dishonest would i say that
because it's a pretty popular opinion
i don't know why you would disbelieve
that now it just happens to cover my ass
now am i
do i feel bad
that the truth
also
somehow helps me no i don't feel bad
about it why should i feel bad
that the truth went my way
in a small way
uh they are making him disappear
and that is
it is amazing to watch it happened
uh you said fair
oh i said fair is uh bs yeah i use the
word fair
in casual conversation while also
believing that it's not a real thing but
you know what fair means in in the
context i use it it means that
uh reasonable people would look at it
and say uh okay
that that's that's all i be there's no
such thing as actual fairness
but there is a situation where human
beings will look at a situation and say
ah that's okay
somebody says you're a coward scott
you're a idiot
i'll tell you if you've watched me for
four years and you think i'm a coward
you're a idiot
so maybe maybe catch up a little bit and
find out what i've been up to
uh that's one of the dumbest opinions
on earth right now
um
you're buying into the scam
which one
did you see the bml rider that was in
the capital
yeah i don't disbelieve that there were
some uh bad elements who are not maga
people but obviously there were plenty
of mega people who made it into the
capital
it is wrong somebody says in capitals
uh wait till these big tech companies
start using our private dms and emails
against us well i assume that's going to
happen that that feels inevitable
if you've said anything by dm or private
message
uh
i you have to assume that that's all
discoverable
my my uh
sort of ongoing approach for the last
several years anyway is that i don't say
anything privately
that i would that would end me if if it
were public
and i say i say bad things publicly in
terms of you know
there could be some things that i
wouldn't say in public i'll say
privately but none of them would end my
career they're not that bad
um
what the jackals are doing to trump is
horrible it is
yeah the wall street journal says trump
isn't guilty of incitement and i agree
from a legal perspective i don't think
you can say that anything he said
was incitement
what i'm saying is he should have known
as a leader that it would have an
unintended effect
that the way he was talking would have
the unintended effect
so if you looked at what he intended
and you look at what he did there's no
mistake
if you ask yourself should a leader have
known
that those things he did which were
technically accurate and legal and okay
that even though they were technically
okay should he have known
it was going to lead to what it led to
and the answer is yes
as a leader he should have known
that even though he didn't break any
laws
it was going to lead to something like
that
excellent question here
do have you noticed that we've all been
trained to think past the sale
the sale is that the election was fine
if the election was fine this is the
official narrative and as you know i
pledged allegiance to it earlier
if the official narrative is also true
then what trump is doing is quite
destructive and
it would look that way
if it turned out and we can't know this
there's no way to know but
hypothetically just as a mental
experiment let's say that the election
hypothetically
no evidence of this that i've seen or at
least no proof of it
let's say it was
illegitimate
then if you were to look at the
president's actions they look a lot
different don't they
what if president trump is the only one
who's right
what if he's the only one who's right
now of course many of you would be right
too if you think there was something
wrong with the election
in that scenario but in terms of the
official narrative
what if trump's the only one who's right
um you can't rule that out
because have there been other situations
where trump was the only one who was
right
yeah
yeah they haven't
right
if he did not have a history
of fairly frequently being the only one
who was right
i would say you wouldn't have to worry
about that but he does have that history
of going against the crowd and
being right
be right
i like this comment buzz your girlfriend
woof
she's my wife
um
you have disappointed us all
i'm sorry jerry french that i've
disappointed you
can you tell me what exactly you're
disappointed in
could you be more specific
by the way my uh follower account
went from 666
000 to
611 000. so
uh
so dropping like a rock
somebody says scott is swinging both
ways now there's an idiot comment
so
from uh
sochu whatever so somebody says that i'm
swinging both ways
now that's
that's a comment from an idiot
because a smart person and i would hope
that there would be more smart people
than dumb people on here a smart person
would say
well
trump has a whole bunch of pluses
but there are some negatives
that's what a smart person would say a
dumb person would say take a side
take aside damn it
that's what dumb people say
taking aside regardless of who's right
and wrong is stupid
that's just stupid
so stupid people should leave this live
stream immediately if you think i should
just take a side
that's stupid
what about personal responsibility of
the crowd
you could have more than one person
responsible the people can be personally
responsible and legally responsible for
whatever they did at the same time
you could have a president who's
inspiring them
yeah it is funny that my voter account
stopped or my follower account stopped
at 666.
do you feel a dealer should be convicted
for an overdose
well i don't think that the legal
standard should be applied to the
presidency so that would be bad at using
analogies
so every time you say but scott
what about this completely different
situation
my answer is always going to be the same
that's a different situation
but scott
what about this other different
situation to which i
i'll bet you can anticipate it say well
that's just another different situation
but if you want to talk about this
situation i'd be happy to if you're
talking about personal responsibility of
you know let's say a drug overdose
the law the law requires
you know
defines who has responsibility for what
if the dealer in your example
sold somebody that they thought was
xanax but turned out to be fentanyl
and the person died from it i do think
the
the dealer should be executed
in my opinion
so does that answer your question now i
think the person who takes it
also has
complete responsibility for their own
decisions
but at the same time the person who
sold them xanax that was really deadly
fentanyl and ended up killing them i
think they should be executed
that's just my opinion
people with cognitive dissonance either
change their minds or change the
interpretation right but it's not
cognitive dissonance if you change your
mind
it's only cognitive dissonance if you
change your hallucination that holds it
all together
uh any comments on twitter versus gab no
i think gab and parlor are all doomed
and by the way the
i i sometimes tell you that i i know the
news before you do
the news about parlor and gab getting in
trouble i knew
months ago
and i knew it from
i won't even tell you who told me
because that would be funny
let's just say that somebody
uh who would know
told me months ago
that parlor and gab would either have to
turn into twitter in other words act the
same way they do or they would go on a
business because if you let the nazis on
etc you know they'll all be canceled
so i knew that months ago there was no
other way it was going to go that parlor
and gab were going to either become
filled with nazis and canceled
or they have to act exactly like twitter
and then there's no point in them
existing so there was never a path for
parlor or gab to ever succeed
now i knew that months ago
because somebody who is
smarter
just told me
and the first time i heard it i was like
oh
yeah there's no other way that can go
they're either going to become twitter
in which case they don't need any reason
to exist
or they're going to go the other way and
they have to get canceled because they'd
be full of nazis and they would lose
their banking it was all obvious it was
it was obvious months ago that we would
be exactly where we are now
um
so have you finalized your california
escape yet
yeah i've got too many ties in
california that wouldn't be
good um i haven't seen arnold
schwarzenegger's thing yet but
i don't really care what his opinion is
on this
um
too little faith scott i don't really
operate on faith
i don't i don't know if you've noticed
it's not really a good way
um
gab has survived without an app but it's
not very uh
vital at the moment
whatever but
my point stands
gab doesn't have a purpose
unless it can be free speech and it
can't
we don't live in a world where it can
the banking the banking system would
just close them down
parlors getting their own servers well
good luck with that
even if they get their own servers it
seems like there would be enough
related companies and advertisers who
don't want to advertise i don't just
don't see how the business model could
work
so the other the other possibility is
locals
locals is where i have a
my content so if i get banned from any
of this stuff you can find me there it's
a subscription service
we're looking at doing groups as
subscriptions
subscriptions yeah so right now you subs
you subscribe to each creator you want
to follow but we have to figure out how
to package it better so that you can get
more creators
scott are you scottish
i am
just a little bit just a little bit of
scottish
uh
when i saw the mass mail-in scam get
normalized i don't know what that's
about
uh
okay somebody says gab works gab works
gab works okay
um
what about italy the the italy story
so i i tweeted uh or retweeted a tweet
by uh
the overstock ceo byrne
and he seems to be the smartest
person who's making these claims
so there's claims about something in
italy that somehow affected our
elections now here's my take on that
if that story is true
that italy was involved in
affecting our elections
if it's true
it will be the first time in my memory
that a story that has that vibe
is true
right so when i say a story that has
that vibe
let me give you an example
if somebody said tomorrow that a large
ape-like creature had been discovered in
the wild
living forever
and i'd say you mean bigfoot
and then the person would say no no not
bigfoot it's a different creature it's a
dinosaur let's say a dinosaur somebody
says we discovered a full-sized dinosaur
and it's been living the whole time in
iceland we'll just pick a place
would you believe that
probably not
in other words it's a story
that has a vibe to it
that you would just say
i don't know if i even need to research
this because i don't think a full-sized
dinosaur has been found in iceland
so there are some things that just by
their vibe
you say
i don't feel like i have to research
this one i feel like i can just
brush this one aside
so the italy story has that vibe to me
it sounds exactly like a story that's
not true
but it is 2021
and we've been surprised before yeah
patrick byrne i couldn't remember his
first name so if you look into patrick
byrne
you'll find out he has some serious
academic credentials you know probably
literally a genius iq i think is is
fair to say and he's looked into it
so
if somebody with those credentials and
that level of intelligence looks into
something and makes a claim should you
take it seriously well you should take
it seriously enough to look into it for
sure i mean he he certainly is earned
that level of credibility
that a claim with specifics and you know
he claims some background we should look
into it
so i'm fully in in favor of well let's
see what's there
but i would say that about everything
if he asked me to bet on it
i would put a pretty big bet on that not
being true
pretty big bet i'd probably give you a
ten to one odds
so i'd probably bet a hundred dollars
against losing a thousand then it's not
true
could it be true well it falls into the
category of i suppose anything's
possible but it doesn't have the feel of
something that's true
that's all i know for sure
all right
that's all i got for now and i will talk
to you tomorrow
