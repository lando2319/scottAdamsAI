hey everybody
come on in yeah it's time and you found
the right place congratulations
you're doing great today and may i
mention because i don't know if anybody
said it yet
but you look great today have you lost
weight
i don't know you just look healthier
younger
sexier and it could be because you've
been
enjoying a little thing that's good for
your health
you know what it is it's called the
simultaneous step
and it's going to happen now but only
only
if you have a copper margarita glass of
tanker tells us to sign a canteen joke
of last a vessel of any kind
and only if you filled it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
yeah it's called the simultaneous sip
have you heard of it
it's big it's all over the world and
it's happening now
go
suddenly i feel a psychic
if not a spiritual connection to every
other simultaneous sipper
everywhere in the world but what about
the people who did not sip
they're dead to me it's like they don't
even exist
but i'm sure they'll get with the
program well let's talk about the most
important thing of the day i just
tweeted a poll for women only
and i'll ask the same thing here so
women only
answer me in the comments is it ever
okay for a man
to wear a v-neck t-shirt
this is looks v-neck because i'm wearing
a microphone but it's not
so that's the question is it ever okay
for a man
women only only women
is it ever okay for men to wear a v-neck
t-shirt
answers are overwhelmingly yes
somebody's wife says no
sure yes yes yes no i love them
yes sure prefer them not to work
somebody says well i've heard it depends
on the guy
so i i've heard that if your
chest area and your arms are in
reasonably good shape you can pull it
off
but if you're kind of hairy and you
haven't worked out maybe you shouldn't
all right well we've settled that let's
talk about something else
um i put a uh a micro lesson on
reframing
how to reframe your experience on the
locals platform
it's a subscription platform for seven
bucks a month you get all my wisdom that
you can't see anywhere else
and i was looking at the responses
to it and it looks like it's
life-changing
and that and i hoped it would be but the
idea of just looking at things
differently
and then how that will change how you
feel about things and how you act
is a really powerful thing so a lot of
people are saying it's
just literally life changing but in
other
news elton john has condemned the pope
for ruling that
same-sex unions are sinful and i thought
to myself
that's kind of a fair fight isn't it
elton john
versus the pope in many ways they're the
same person aren't they
if you hold it you had elton john just
just do this exercise just imagine
elton john and then just think sort of
generally about elton john's
vibe you know just just feel him just
generally hold that in your head
now think of the pope the same guy
that's the same guy wouldn't you like to
see them have a cage fight
and the winner gets to decide who gets
married
i'd like that i mean there's two people
who like flamboyant clothing
and being in public
and i was trying to imagine um you know
who could referee this fight and
obviously
god would be the best referee and so i'm
imagining the pope
praying over this and praying to god and
unlike unlike regular people if you pray
to god
you don't you don't feel him actually
talking back usually
maybe some of you do it's more of a
feeling right but if you're the pope
it's more like a phone call
and he's like hey dude god you know i've
got this situation elton john
is uh mad at me because of this uh
same-sex union thing i came out against
it
and god would say wait who
who who's against you
elton john elton john
i love tiny dancer and the pope would be
okay let's not get
sidetracked just a question about these
sinful same-sex unions who's right elton
john or me
and god says have you heard levon
it's amazing i play it all the time up
here in heaven
and the pope would be can we stay on the
topic so anyway i think elton john would
probably get the nod if it came down to
that
did you see the the shocking video of a
small plane
in florida crashing into a car
on the ground apparently a few people
died or
yeah i guess if you died it's a shocking
looking thing
but you have to have really bad luck
i'm not making fun of this i'm just
saying you have to have really bad luck
to die because a plane hit you while you
were driving in your car
again i'm not making fun of it but that
is
really bad luck
and one of the little insider things i
happen to know from
hanging around pilots is that the type
of plane that this was is called a
beechcraft
bonanza and it has a it has a nickname
it has a nickname that the company who
makes this airplane
really doesn't want me to say i'm going
to say anyway
among pilots they call this plane that
crashed
is nicknamed uh the doctor killer
yeah i could see it in the comments
somebody already knew that
yeah pilots call that that type of plane
a doctor killer
and the reason is that uh rich people
and doctors just being an example i
will often get this plane and not
realize that it's
a little bit hard to handle it's a
little bit more powerful than
an average plane in that class if you
were to compare this to say
a cessna uh this is just stuff i hear
from pilots
that a cessna wants to land if you get a
cessna
anywhere near an airport and and take
your
and take your hands off the controls the
cessna will just sort of land
now that's an exaggeration you really
have to land it but it lands really
easily
whereas the high performance planes come
in at a much higher speed
and they're built for performance
they're not built for the the subtleties
of landing
and so they're kind of difficult to land
this one is in the
slightly difficult to land category but
i'll tell you what really struck me
about it
no pun intended is that when you see the
video the plane comes in at an
angle like this and actually hits nose
first
now i feel like it's almost impossible
to hit nose first if you're still flying
so either he lost flight control
or the pilot was unconscious because you
there's almost no way
that even if you lost all engine you
still wouldn't hit at that angle
there had to be a steering problem i
think so when it comes out we'll find
out
all right um
this i almost canceled everything i was
going to say today
just to go on a swearing cursing streak
about the next
story and this just happened i guess uh
joy reid was interviewing governor
newsom
about who he's going to appoint to
replace
if if senator feinstein were to retire
and joy reid asked if he would appoint a
black woman to the u.s senate
if feinstein retires and his answer was
i have multiple names in mind and the
answer is yes
so the governor just said that if you're
white
you're not in consideration for the job
if you're hispanic
hispanic american you're not in
consideration to be a senator
if you're asian-american
you are not considered to be a senator
by the governor of new york who gets to
make the decision
now i'm trying really hard
to not curse but
isn't this everything that the united
states isn't
this is this is everything we're not
um you've probably noticed that i've
been relatively
compared to a lot of people relatively
not much of a critic
of governor newsom i think he's got some
explaining to do
right there's some things he needs to
explain but i also generally thought
you know he's sort of a well-intentioned
and
he's certainly smart right so we have
some qualities i'm not going to ignore
that
but and and i was forgiving about
you know coronavirus decisions because
i've said every
everybody's guessing on that um
and even even immigration is just a
tough place to be right
because if anybody had like a great
solution for immigration it would have
been done by now
so i'm not even too hard on them on the
things that
clearly he seems to be failing on
everything from forest management to
energy management
a lot of failing but i've been
relatively
okay in term well not okay but as a
critic i've been
holding back a little bit i don't know
if you've noticed it
seems like almost everybody is harder on
him than i am
and then this happened
all right i'm not going to get through
this without swearing
so here's your here's your uh official
uh warning
if you've got kids in the room probably
want to put the earmuffs on them right
now
when you tell me mr
mayor i'm sorry not mayor but governor
that i'm not qualified for a job because
of my skin color
well at that point
uh let's let's just say you've gone too
far
now i would act exactly the same way
if he'd said he didn't but if he had
said i won't appoint a black person to
be senator
imagine that how would you feel about
that well i'd be pretty pissed
because that's not the country i don't
live in right would you want to live in
a country
where your governor said no i'll
definitely not appoint a black person
for this
senator job you you won't get even
considered
if you're black well immediately he
would lose his job of course
but you should be really really mad
like if if that happened in your country
the whole point of the country
is that we don't do that
let me say it again the whole
point
of america the whole point
is that we don't do that that's the
thing we don't do
you can do every other thing
everything you you can murder people
you know you can do all kinds of
terrible terrible mistakes
but in america that's the one thing
we don't do
if you get that wrong the whole
experiment
you might as well just throw it in the
 toilet
like it the moment you can se the
governor can go on television
and say write to our faces that your
ethnicity will disqualify you
for the one of the top jobs in
california
that's not the country you want to live
in and and it has nothing to do with the
fact that
which ethnicity he decided to prefer for
this
it has nothing to do with which one he
picked exactly the same no matter
what he said as long as he was saying
some people can't be senator
now i get i get that diversity is
important
and if you gave me a choice of having
more diversity or less i would take more
certainly in a representative government
i think that's just healthy
so i want more but not like this
not this way is this the way you get it
oh my god and the fact the shocking
thing is that he could say this
proudly he didn't say it like oh
you know sheepishly uh
might have to go this way no he said it
like
everybody should be patting him on the
back and giving him a raise and
and reelected him yeah i'm going to
discriminate by race
it's amazing and so i would say that
this turned me
from being uh well if governor newsom
you know survives the recall
you know the soviet that's what the
people wanted in the state
but now i feel like i have to end him
politically
now i feel like i can't ignore him
anymore like he went from
it's hard to ignore but i can do it to i
can't ignore this
i can't ignore this it's way over the
line
cnn held a focus group of republicans
who are
hesitant about getting the vaccinations
and they wanted to
sort of see what was in their heads like
why is it you'd be hesitant
and anderson cooper who's talking about
this segment
acted very surprised that the
republicans on the panel
were being persuaded by science
as opposed to politics that's right
anderson cooper
was actually surprised that the
republicans sounded
rational and when they said when the
vaccinations you know first were
announced we were more skeptical
because we wanted more science as more
science comes in
and you know we can watch the experience
and get more and more information
we're more persuaded to take it because
we have more scientific information
and anderson cooper acts like he's
 surprised
that republicans would be persuaded
by information and science
and now here's the thing
are you surprised i wasn't surprised
because i don't think there's anybody
who isn't who isn't uh
persuaded by additional information in
science over time
right and i think he thought that
it was trump or just republicanism or
something
that was causing these people to be
skeptical as opposed to being completely
smart
and simply being cautious and wanting to
have as much information as they could
so it's amazing that he's amazed i guess
there's a story today because the press
is just so bored without trump they have
to reach into the past
and try to pull something back to the
the present to make a story at it
so i guess when kushner his last trip to
the middle east
or israel were talking about the abraham
accords and he ran up a hotel bill
of over 25 000 for room and board
and that's a big story do you know why
that's a big story
because the public doesn't know what
first class hotel accommodations cost
it's about that much something like that
so um you know could he have traveled
more cheaply yeah probably probably
did i mention that jared kushner has
been nominated for the nobel
peace prize for the good work he got
done on these trips
you could argue that he could have
traveled cheaper
but you can't argue that he didn't do
something worth it
in fact i would argue he's the only
person who
you know he and avi berkowitz might be
the only people in the government
who deserve the amount of travel
accommodations that they received
they got nominated for the nobel peace
prize it's amazing
so i certainly don't care about his
hotel bill
david boxenhorn on twitter tweeted an
article from the times of israel saying
that
they got their r factor down to 0.78
i don't think anybody could really
measure that do you think any country
can really
measure their r factor accurately but
maybe they can get in the range so if
you were not
up on what the r factor is if your r
is one or greater it means that each
person
you know might be spreading it to enough
people that it will
spread that's that's the worst
explanation ever
let me try it again if your r is over
one it means the virus can spread if
it's under one
it will probably die out naturally by
not having enough people to spread to
and we're not being you know what i'm
talking about
i know i have to do better than that um
but israel's already under one
reportedly i don't know how reliable
that is
i wouldn't say that's the most reliable
kind of thing
but it's not way over one
and if you're looking for any positive
signs
this one's a good one because israel is
doing well on the vaccinations
and they're getting the outcome that is
predicted
so anytime your science says if you do
this you'll get this outcome
and then you do this and you get that
outcome
that's pretty good news all right
in the george floyd case uh jack posabic
reports
that uh juror number 51
admits she cannot be impartial after
hearing that the city
awarded george floyd's family a record
27 million dollars
now shouldn't they all say that
is there a juror now presumably all of
the jurors know about this 27 million
because
one juror talked about it in front of
the other jurors
so if they didn't see it in the news
they heard about it in the courtroom
who would be dumb enough to say that
they would not be influenced by that
because of course everybody would be
influenced by that wouldn't you worry if
somebody said they weren't
influenced by that because it means they
already decided
if anybody tells you that they would not
be biased
by this 27 million award
it's only because they've already made
up their mind that's not the person you
want on the jury
and so i ask you this why are we
bothering to have this trial
because there i don't see any way that
the trial outcome
could be considered credible or that it
wouldn't get overturned
by some higher court for saying your
court your trial was ridiculous
there's there's no chance in hell that
the chauvin got a fair trial
so i don't know the i don't know how
this works legally
but shouldn't the judge just cancel the
trial
and try to find a venue that maybe is
you know less likely to be this biased
i feel as if they have to you know i i
feel as if they have to end the trial at
this point
i don't know if they will but they have
to um
so there's a rasmussen poll result
coming this morning i don't know if it's
published yet but you'll see it
and they asked the question of whether
people believed that joe biden
was actually making the decisions of the
presidency
or somebody else was making those
decisions
for him what percentage of the united
states
i don't know if this was likely voters
or not because lots of times they limit
things to likely voters but i don't know
if this one was
but what percentage do you think the
pool said are people who believe that
biden
is not actually in charge
if you guessed 47 you would be right
it's funny i'm seeing estimates of like
70 percent and 60 percent
here's what i think i think those are
closer to true
i believe that republicans all said
biden is not in charge
and the democrats probably mostly said
he is in charge
and and that if you actually
if you were to talk to a democrat
privately
and nobody would ever hear what you ever
said the two of you
and you get you get your democrat your
biden voter in a in a closet you say
look
nobody will ever hear this just tell me
the truth
do you think biden's in george how many
people
in the closet when nobody would ever
know what they really said
how many of them would say that biden's
really in charge
right i'm not so
sure that the democrats think biden's in
charge i think they don't care
i think that they think that oh maybe
it's obama's
behind the curtain or hillary clinton or
you know it's just the uh the
technocrats or the money people or
whatever but maybe they're just okay
with it
so that's interesting
uh there's an a brand new hoax has been
revealed and this one's a big one
the washington post back in january
9th had reported that trump had had a
phone call with the georgia state
elections
with i guess the georgia state whatever
election official
and he reportedly said but it turns out
he didn't but it was reported that he
said
find the fraud now find the fraud
was interpreted as even if it's not
there go find it
or give me a result that says there's
fraud
i don't care if it's really there or not
so that's how it was interpreted
but turns out he never even said it
because an audio of the call was just
released
never said it and it was one of the key
pieces of evidence for the impeachment
trial
think about that a key piece of the
impeachment trial
was based on a hoax no that's not true
did i just tell you that a key part of
this big
public impeachment process
was a hoax because that's not true
two hoaxes two hoaxes
were key pieces of evidence presented
one of them was the find people hoax
which the republicans debunked in public
and the other one was this one which
wasn't debunked at the time because we
didn't have the audio
but now we have the audio and you know
that the president never said
find the fraud and the actual things he
said were not offensive at all
he was telling them to you know look
into it and they might find some
dishonesty there
nothing like find the fraud
so uh then i have i said
shouldn't the senators who perpetrated
these two frauds
uh for impeachment shouldn't they be
impeached
should it not be impeachable to use
hoaxes
to try to change the government of the
united states
now somebody else on twitter saw that
and said
oh whoa there's a difference
because those senators who used these
hoaxes
they did not know that there were hoaxes
when they used them
do you accept that explanation let's say
it's true
let's say that uh the senators who used
both of those
hoaxes let's say they thought they were
both true
is it okay no
no it's not okay because we don't judge
them by what they were thinking
do we we judge them by what they do
we don't judge them by what they're
thinking
because that's what they were trying to
do with trump they're trying to say that
well let me say that differently when
trump was giving his speech in which he
said
go uh protest peacefully
people said yeah he said peacefully
but he intended to cause more of a
riot or an assault and so the president
they were trying to impeach him based
entirely upon what they believe he
thought
um right it was based on what he thought
but ultimately it was more about what he
did wasn't it
so regardless of what trump thought
he would also be criticized by simply
doing it
you know simply getting people stirred
up no matter what anybody thought
it resulted in maybe more more activity
or writing than would have happened
we don't know but that's a reasonable
assumption
and and so why should the senators
who allegedly did not know these were
hoaxes
why should they get a pass just because
they didn't know
i think we should judge them on what
they did not on what they knew
take the the coronavirus performance
president trump uh allegedly was
lost the election because of coronavirus
performance
if did anybody know the right answer
do you think that the that the president
knew
that his actions would have a
sub-optimal outcome
no so if the president allegedly made a
mistake
but he didn't know he was making a
mistake does he does he get a pass
because he didn't know he was making a
mistake no
we don't judge people that way we judge
them what they actually did
and what these senators actually did was
trying to change the government of the
united states
on the back of two hoaxes it doesn't
matter
that they didn't know they were real it
doesn't matter
they should be removed from office
because they did the thing
they did the thing that's it
all right the uh
here's i love this story
if you don't mind i'm going to
be a little self-indulgent i'll tell you
about the news here it's a big story
but i'm going to be a little
self-indulgent just warning you
um there's a big article that you should
read in new york magazine by david
wallace wells in which he goes through
all the various countries of the world
and how they dealt with the pandemic
and he's trying to figure out why some
did better than others
you know the big mystery that we all
have now the bottom line
in a very large an article that's really
good you should read it i think it does
one of the best jobs i've seen of really
putting things in context of who did
what and what worked and what didn't
but here was the bottom line nobody
knows what worked
that's the bottom line when you compare
countries
and one had a good result one had a bad
result
there's no pattern there's no pattern
you just can't tell that what people did
made that much difference
now there does there does seem to be a
big difference
between the asian countries performance
which was generally good
and the european western united states
south american countries which was
generally
mediocre or bad
but we don't know exactly why because
even within the asian countries
japan did not do aggressive
mitigation but had a great result
so you're tempted to say well all the
asian countries did everything right
the other countries did everything wrong
duh
of course the result is different except
that doesn't hold up
you just look at japan and you say uh
they didn't do everything right
and they got a great result and then you
look at
new zealand and you say well maybe it's
more because of being an island
maybe the island thing makes a
difference so it looked like
that the bottom line was that it might
be just
chance just chance
yeah there there's a big factor of
obesity and
age so i think youth and lack of obesity
explains uh africa basically i think
africa
can be completely explained by lack of
obesity
and youth in my opinion now genetics
we haven't determined yet how big a
factor that is but surely that's a
factor
surely it is but i don't know if it's an
ethnic factor or a factor within
ethnicities
i would say that's an open question um
so do you remember that early on in the
crisis
i made a prediction that i believe
nobody else in the world made
and that prediction was that the
leadership decisions
would not be determinant of the outcome
did you hear anyone else in the entire
world
ever say that just me right
and this article kind of makes that case
as well
that now that we kind of know how things
turn down
mostly mostly we know there is not a
correlation
between how people acted and how the
outcomes were
and we don't know why the experts are
actually baffled
now they do know a whole bunch of things
that make a difference
we know the vitamin d makes a difference
the the weight
the probably the genetics there's a big
difference
uh maybe in just where you are located
what kind of travel patterns you have
are you a travel destination
when when did it hit your shores how
close were you to italy
it turns out that proximity to italy is
probably one of the biggest factors
because italy uh well you know was sort
of the second hot spot after wuhan
um but there was something else in this
article that
caught my attention and i would like to
read it to you okay
and you'll you'll see why i'm reading it
to you it'll be obvious in a minute
so this is from the new york magazine
david wallace wells writes
by american standards cuomo talking
about governor cuomo
did move quickly putting his state in
lockdown just 20 days after the first
confirmed case three times faster than
washington state or california
but he waited for cases to arrive on his
doorstep to act and even
and even then his first instinct was to
reassure rather than disrupt
in that he was far from an outlier
through the winter again to the good
part here through the winter
the guidance from america's public
health establishment was clear
beamed to the public through columns and
op-eds like those in the new york times
warning
quote beware the pandemic panic and in
the washington post
arguing quote we should be wary of an
aggressive government response to
coronavirus
other headlines from the time quote we
should de-escalate the war on the
coronavirus that was from wired
coronavirus is scary but the flu is
deadlier
more widespread from us today the flu is
far
bigger threat to most people in the u.s
than the wuhan coronavirus
that's from business insider
and before flu conference comparisons
became a talking point
of the pandemic denier right they were
the reassuring focus
of the establishment left so this
so the first point is that the
left-leaning people
in the establishment were all telling
you that the pandemic
should not be worried about keep that in
mind all right
and here's the here's the money
paragraph perhaps the short-sighted and
self-interested president
meaning trump would never have moved
more quickly or more emphatically in
response to a different kind of warning
but governors might have and mayors and
the public at large
instead the cause of the alarm was
picked up
not by those in positions of social
authority
or with the power to enact preparatory
preparatory measures
but by a rogue's gallery of outsiders
and contrarians peter navarro
trump's personal china hawk scott adams
the dilbert guy balaji sreenivasan
a cryptocurrency of evangelists from
silicon valley
eric feigl ding a nutrition focused
epidemiologist then affiliated
with harvard who who got a bit out over
his skis and a series of panic inducing
tweets then came in for a professional
drubbing
by his colleagues
now i could not enjoy this more
because uh in this long article
about all these world leaders getting
everything wrong
i got called out by name as one of the
few people in the country who got
something right
now i would like to make a few comments
in the
murray gel man way you know the murray
the gel man amnesia theory that you can
always tell what's wrong with an article
if it's about you or about something
you're an expert on
now in this case i have a little insight
so let me tell you what the news may
have gotten not wrong
but maybe could have put a little more
context on here
listen to the descriptions of these
people
number one peter navarro trump's
personal china hawk
is that how you would describe peter
navarro
as a china hawk if you're just going to
do
one description china hawk
how about economist how about famous
economists
all right so that's what they left out
about peter navarro
then they talked about scott adams the
dilbert guy
what'd they leave out they leave they
left out my degree in economics
my mba right i'm just the cartoonist now
i'm the dilbert guy
so the first two people that are listed
in the rogues
gallery to make us look like we're your
son
fringe nuts they left out
that we're both trained economists
this matters because this was a math
question
basically you know the spread of the
spread of the virus and how to do
risk management it's kind of closer to
an economics question than the medical
question
and if you leave out the cl the
qualifications
of the two people who got it right you
know being alarmed at the right level of
alarm at the right time
they both had the same education that's
not an accident
if you leave that end of the story it
makes it look like we're
like lucky crazy people or something
instead of people who had
exactly the right training to know what
to do
in this situation and got it right
isn't that a big difference in how you
see this story
because it seems presented like oh there
were some crazy outliers who guessed
right or something
um and then the next one is even funnier
belagi
srinivasanis he's described as a
cryptocurrency
from silicon valley now is that
true yes that's a true statement you
could you could say you would probably
uh embrace it himself i think uh blaji
would agree that he is a
crypto evangelist and he's from silicon
valley true enough
here's what they left out
calling bellagi a crypto evangelist
is like calling einstein jewish
well actually i don't know if he's
officially called himself jewish
but it would just be like picking one
little thing
out of and of somebody's life that might
be the least
important thing about bellagi now
i won't get too much into bellagio's
qualifications
but let's just say that if you added up
all of the brains of the people watching
this
and and all of your skills and all of
your talents and
you could somehow sum together all of
our skills and intelligence
it would roughly equal one bellagi
right he's not normal like
when you when you just refer to bellagi
as a crypto guy
you're missing the story he's not
a crypto guy he's a guy who
knows more than you know about more
things than you know even exist
he's not normal smart he's like he's
like the kind of smart
where it's uh you know i'm the dog
talking to a person
like if you talk to bellagi for five
minutes the
the recording that starts playing in
your head is i don't think i'm the same
species
i can't be the same species because i'm
not that smart
and so they leave that out literally
balaji is literally famous in silicon
valley
as being one of the smartest people on
the planet right
and they they just call him a crypto guy
somebody said spell his name so i will
first name is balaji
b-a-l-a-j-i
and srinivasan is s-r-i-n-i-v
a-s-a-n
yeah you should follow him on twitter um
so ah god i want to make some news here
but i'm not sure if i should
yeah what the hell what the hell
do you want to hear some news uh i don't
know if this will
get outside of my little
little atmosphere here so here's
something that you've never heard
reported
i probably shouldn't even tell you this
let me think about it um
no i'm not going to tell you i can't
tell you
all right sorry about that i apologize
for that all right there's a story about
uh north
north korean leader uh kim jong-un's
sister
and apparently she's responding to the
biden administration
and she said about the biden
administration
if it wants to sleep in peace for the
next four years it must refrain from
causing a stink as its first step
and i thought i wonder if this is just
how north korea
opens up a dialogue that the
uh
it looks like i made everybody mad i'm
looking at the comments
um all right i'll tell you
you want me to tell you
all right um
when the news first came out
that the coronavirus had broken
broken out in and we started to see the
the video of what
the chinese were doing
as you might imagine the white house was
trying to
decide what to do no surprise right
there was also you might not be
surprised this would not be news
that there were two sides there were
there were
factions within the white house who are
arguing we should close
travel with china and there were
factions who said no no no that's
you know it will kill the economy etc
travel especially
and here's the part you don't know
somebody at the white house who shall
remain nameless
contacted me and said we're having this
discussion in the white house
and a lot of people in the white house
watch your show
can you make your argument basically
so the white house did ask me to weigh
in to try to influence
the internal debate by having somebody
external to the white house
lay it out in a way that you know is
outside of the system
so that it's no it's no it wasn't don jr
um and so i did
and some of you probably watched live
the day that i came on i just came
unhooked
on closing travel from china and it was
soon after that the president
just a few days after that the president
actually closed
travel from china now when you first
heard me talking about it
on live stream did you say to yourself
that's never going to happen because the
first time you heard somebody say we
should close all travel to china
you might have heard it from me you know
if you were watching this i probably was
the first person
to to talk about it and even when i was
saying
i was saying we absolutely have to close
travel from china
and have to do it right now but even as
i said it i didn't think it could happen
honestly i just didn't think it could
happen
but i knew it had to like it was
important
um i'm saying in the comments people are
guessing
you know famous names that you know who
work there it's it's not one of the
famous
you won't be able to guess it based on
somebody who's in the headlines i'll
just tell you that
okay so um
it turns out that a number of the people
in the white house
follow uh follow this live stream or
they did in that administration
and uh occasionally and by the way this
is not
that unusual it wouldn't be terribly
unusual
for factions within any administration
to reach out to somebody
you know in the public to to get an
assist
pretty normal stuff so um
it was fun to see that this article in
the new york magazine
sort of called me out on that
but they don't know the real backstory
so there you have it
was that news
yeah they do it all the time it is a
normal process and i don't know who
who else was part of that um
but uh yeah there's there's more to that
story all right
cnn looks like they're doing this slow
turn
on biden because they have to have some
bad stuff to say about them so they can
produce news
and stephen collinson who's the
designated trump
hit person who does you know frequent
articles that are all anti-trump forever
this is what he said about biden's
handling of the child
migrant surge so this is cnn
coming down hard on biden for
basically kids in cages but without the
cages
and this is an exact quote from cnn but
it's hard to argue that the biden
administration's handling of the
politics
of the child migrant surge has been
adept
that's pretty pretty biting compare that
to
uh things he said about trump now let me
let me read it again
if this isn't the weakest criticism
you've ever seen
i don't know all right but it is hard to
argue
why do you have to why do you have to
soften the first part of the sentence
it's hard to argue that the biden
administration's handling of the
politics
the politics of the child migrant surge
oh oh it's not a problem with the surge
itself
that biden caused it's not a problem
with all the children who are being
you know in this bad situation which i
thought was the whole point
that it's bad for children no no
no it's hard to argue that the biden
administration's handling
of the politics of the child migrant
surge
has been adept it's hard to
argue that it's been adept
biting biting commentary
i don't know how the biden
administration will be able to sleep at
night after this take down
by cnn um
so it looks like uh there's reports that
senator rick scott
is preparing some kind of a daca amnesty
deal
that would uh if if we can build
the rest of the wall a bunch of people
could be
um given citizenship that doesn't have
any chance does it
is there any chance for a bipartisan
anything
in this country i don't think so it
feels like immigration
can't be solved but with a bipartisan
anything
because no just nobody will do it
so i'm not saying it's a bad play i
think
senator scott is making exactly
exactly the right move
because you want to see that your
senators are at least trying
and you know i never i'm never bothered
by somebody putting on a deal offer you
know you do this we'll do this
even if i hate part of that deal that's
what a deal is
so kudos to senator scott for
trying to be productive i don't know
that this is going to succeed
but at least it's a it's adult behavior
you know
i don't mind people failing doing the
right stuff
and at least bringing up the topic
getting people to talk about it
see what can and cannot be done i
imagine it will fail
but it's it's adult and so i appreciate
that
um as i keep saying that we only have a
handful of senators who do anything
am i wrong about that every time you
hear somebody doing something
it's the same handful of people it's
going to be you know it's it's tom
cotton it's
rand paul senator scott it's just
like five six people doing everything
everybody else is just watching as far
as i can tell
all right
all right just looking at your comments
and
um i would like to suggest a following
uh psychological
uh phenomenon it goes like this
i've told you that we're seeing not much
reporting on the
uh the discomfort of getting your
vaccination now it was reported by even
the people who make the vaccinations
that there would be some discomfort
but aren't you surprised that the news
business both left and right
are just not really reporting on that
really not at all and that feels like a
um
a decision to make sure that people
don't get talked out of doing
it right but here's an interesting thing
even though a lot of people know that
they know it hurts
and i've talked to people personally so
i've had personal conversations
with people who just got the kicked
out of them with the second dose
so i guess the first dose gives you like
a sore arm
but by the second dose you're gonna miss
work
you know you're gonna miss 24 hours
recovering
but here's the thing i'll bet if you
talk to
anybody who had a really tough time
they're not complaining
and that that's the psychological part
and you say to me
scott you're going to get this shot and
you know i hate to break it to you but
you're going to have a bad day
the next 24 hours for you are going to
be pretty bad
what do i say in reaction to that
give me the shot what do i say when i'm
writhing in whatever discomfort it is
not writhing it's not that bad
but you know when i'm all let's say
shaky and
i don't know sore or whatever it is the
next day how do i
feel psychologically when my body is
having all these reactions and i'm not
having a good day
how do i feel terrific
it's the weirdest thing but if you could
if you can say
right now i'll give you that second shot
you're gonna be writhing in pain
i would only be happy there's not one
part of that that would make me unhappy
number one i would know that the pain
would be done in a day
and that always helps right if you know
there's a an end date to your discomfort
that that makes it easier but the fact
that i would feel
free or or soon to be free
from the the risk of the pandemic that
psychological comfort
is so much bigger than missing a day of
work
that people aren't even complaining
about it
you know think about it in the united
states we'll complain about anything
there's nothing we don't complain about
zero people i've heard complain about
the vaccination
taking them out for a day i've heard
nobody complained
i've heard people say it was bad but
even when they describe it
it's not really a complaint it's
interesting
i've never seen anything like this where
people can be physically
you know sickened by something
temporarily
and they won't complain because we feel
so
good about getting to this point we've
all been waiting for it's like give me
the shot
it's interesting well i still don't know
where i can get the shot
i found out that i'm eligible yay for me
uh i didn't realize that hypertension
can get you
can get you there especially if you're
close to the
you know the the age anyway so i'm i'm
bumping up against the age
but i also have hypertension so i guess
that got me in
but i can't get it as far as i know
there's no availability of this shot
whatsoever for me personally
my health provider doesn't have it
doesn't seem to be available anywhere
else
so uh i told you before that
people being um let's say concerned
about getting the shot
would never be the problem that the
problem will
only be supply because there will always
be enough people to use up all the
supply
and then those laggards will watch
everybody else get the
get the shot and they'll start to
convert and you're not gonna have
in the end i predict you won't have a
problem getting
enough people vaccinated maybe eighty
percent
i don't think we'll get to a hundred
percent well actually we could get to
ninety
but we'll never get to a hundred
um all right
somebody says mississippi gives it to
anyone above 18
but they probably don't have it it
doesn't matter that they say they will
yeah the alameda fairgrounds you need to
um
that's where i would get it it's the
closest to me but you can't
get an appointment all right that's it
for now and i will talk to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers walgreens yeah i
know that the
i know all the places that do give the
shots but they just don't have
appointments
um all right that's all for now i'll
talk to you tomorrow
