is a copper bug or glass of tanker
chelsea stein the canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite beverage
i like coffee
and drink meat
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
well the queen of england is uh ill and
family members are gathering around
uh which is usually the signal that the
cat's on the roof
meaning that i don't think that they're
expecting the queen to recover from this
because when you do the family is
gathering around part
that's kind of telling you the the game
is about over
uh here's what i will predict about that
are you ready for a prediction
do you believe that the news happens on
a
sort of a
random schedule
do you think that news happens but it
just happens when it happens
and if if it's going to happen that's
when it happens
no not the political stuff
so here's my prediction
should the queen pass
do you know what's going to happen
all of the bad news about trump will
suddenly stop for a while
because they need to save the good stuff
to when you're paying attention
they're not going to fight with a queen
story
so for about a week or so
if the queen passes
for about a week or so the political
news will get really boring
and that's how you know it's never been
real
if you ever want to test to see if the
news is real or manufactured
watch how it stops
when there's a competing story
now i could be wrong right there's some
things that the news can't control
but things like an anonymous source told
us something bad about trump
i'll bet you that anonymous source is
going to wait another week
if there's a competing story so look for
that
as you know
russia cut off europe from its
gas deliveries
and selling it to the far east
and china in particular but that plan
might not be as awesome as they hoped
because china just bought a
ton of
uh lng
and
they bought it a half uh
half of the current spot price
china is buying russia's gas
but at half the market price
i don't know why it's half must be some
reason
but
um this reminds me that
if you're worried about china and russia
becoming too close
i don't think they're friends
yeah i don't think anybody's going to do
any favors for the other i think it's
just business
so if china gets a chance to screw
russia on the business deal they're
going to do it
and wouldn't expect anything else of
course
but i don't know that russia is in a
good place here
depending on china to keep you alive
seems like a really bad proposition
because they'd have a lot of power on
you
all right here's something that messed
up my mind pretty good
i've mentioned before that there's a
small number of people
who if they disagree with me
i immediately have to change my opinion
it's like oh damn it
you know for example if i had you know
some dumbass opinion about the
constitution
but i heard alan dershowitz say the
opposite opinion
i would immediately say ah damn it
dershowitz and i would just agree with
him because my own opinion would be
worthless in that context
but
i just found out that elon musk thinks
that fusion energy will never be uh
economical
that's the opposite of what everybody
thinks right
the whole point of fusion
is that once you get the reaction going
it's the most economical thing you can
do
well
uh musk who i believe has invested in
fusion
and so he would know what's actually on
the
you know on the workbench as well as
what's in the real world
and
he says in a tweet
fusion would be expensive energy given
the difficulty of obtaining and
transporting source fuel
and that's interesting because i thought
you only had to do that once wasn't that
the whole point of fusion
that once you get your source fuel it
doesn't need new fuel
so is it really that hard to get in
transport i don't know so it's something
that was new to me
uh plus maintaining the reactor so it
would be hard to maintain the reactor
he says it's far better to use the sun
the thermal and thermal
thermo nuclear reactor with no need to
refuel or service
now here's my problem with that
i feel as if he's making a prediction
about fusion
based on what we know how to do today
isn't that right
it looks like a prediction about the
future
based on what we know how to do today
and that seems wrong coming from him
doesn't it
because do you think he knew how to go
to mars before he started
i don't think he did i think he figured
it out
and they're still figuring it out right
do you think he knew how to build tesla
before he started
i don't think so
i don't do you think he knew
the battery technology
would progress the way it has which has
been quite tremendous
he probably hoped it would but he didn't
know exactly what innovations would be
next i don't think he did did he i mean
if he did that'd be pretty impressive
so i feel as if he's got a little bit of
a
apples and orange or a bias going on
here somehow
it's hard to tell what's going on
one possibility is he just knows more
about it than we do
and you're finding out
the other possibility is
i feel like
he's picked a favorite
you know he's got more money invested in
batteries of course
so
i don't know i feel as if
looking at fusion and saying we don't
know how to solve these problems
is not fair because we didn't know how
to solve the problems for anything else
we always start first and then solve the
problems but it could be that he knows
that the nature of fusion is that it'll
always be difficult to maintain or
always difficult to get the fuel i don't
know so i don't quite understand the
comment but i'm uh but i immediately
abandoned my old opinion
and i hate that he does that to me
because
i i can no longer hold a public opinion
that fusion is our economical savior
it might be
but i don't want to be on the other side
of this question from musk do you
man crush
all right
um i'm going to test your
mind reading ability
if you were asked a question let's say
if the public were asked this question
if student loan forgiveness means
colleges will raise their prices
for example support for the policy
uh what is that what happens to support
for the loan forgiveness if you believe
that colleges would just raise their
prices
because then students wouldn't have to
pay as much in theory
would you still be in favor of loan
forgiveness if it's just going to cause
prices and colleges to go up
what percentage of the public
believed
that loan forgiveness is still a good
idea if colleges just raise their prices
oh you're good
it's exactly 25
yeah
oh you're good
you're good
let's talk about carrie lake
carrie lake has
announced
that she says she has discovered
evidence of voter fraud i assume that
means in her state arizona
in the last election
but she won't tell us what it is
because the fake news is fake news
but she's given it to the attorney
general
right what can we conclude about this
discovery that she has about voter fraud
what what can we know for sure based on
what we what little we know about the
situation
let me tell you what
you can you can know for sure
it's not important
it's not important
if it were important
you would do both you would give it to
the ag but you'd also give it to the
news
if it were important
so what we can say for sure is it's not
important
but she's selling it like it's important
by not you know acting like
i can't tell you
so persuasion wise
pretty good
because it makes you talk about the
thing that you can't confirm
does that sound familiar
making you talk about the thing that you
can't confirm
like what's in those boxes
yeah it's the same play so carrie lake
is just doing the same play on the
democrats as the democrats are doing on
trump well there might be something in
those boxes
i can't show you
but trust us somebody's seen it and boy
are they concerned about what's in those
boxes and how about russian collusion
well mueller's looking into it
my god you don't know what he's found by
now all the potential russia collusion
we can't tell you about it we can't tell
you what he's found yet
it's all secret but trust us you've got
to be worried about that
so she's just throwing it back in the
democrats
oh i've got a secret i can't tell you
about it but trust me
trust me when you see it it's going to
be bad
so it's pretty clever
it's a
it's sketchy but it's clever
all right
speaking of
not being able to predict the future
there's a battery company
looks like it looks like a startup i
think uh
called lighten l-y-t-a-n
now
the punch line of the story comes at the
end all right so the first part's
interesting but wait for the end
so they figured out they think how to
make a
better battery than the normal ones for
cars and stuff
and they would use
materials that are all available in the
united states
so if their technology
works and if it's widely adopted
we would not be beholden to china or
anybody else for any materials needed to
build them so that's good and apparently
they'd be you know basically better in
every way
um but of course this is startups you
have to wait but here's the punchline
they won a competition for
top 10 battery
battery new battery makers i guess
top 10
which means that there are at least nine
other companies
they're probably roughly as
have roughly the potential of this one
so whatever you think is the future of
battery technology
you're probably way off
right it's always about invention it's
about the surprise
and this is just one company out of 10
that are planning a surprise for you
you know they won't all succeed but
that's 10 companies that probably have
been funded
and they think they've got a surprise
coming for you that's big big news
that's big big news
but you never know which company is so
it's hard to it's hard to really know
like when's the point when you can get
all excited it's just going to be this
sort of gradual improvement
and 10 years from now you're going to
say to yourself
wow
battery sure got good
so it looks like that's going to happen
i think the cdc proved beyond any doubt
that they're corrupt
so the
was it walensky the director of the cdc
was asked about um
the wisdom of giving the booster shots
to young and or healthy people
because you know everything's different
now it's omicron and blah blah
so instead of saying well maybe
you know we have a good reason to give
it to the healthy people
or to say
that there was some medically uh
reasonable reason to do it this way do
you know what she said
she said it was to simplify the
messaging
what
that's right
she defended giving vaccinations to
people that don't need them
because they're young or healthy
or both
because it's simpler to say everybody
everybody just take it
that actually happened
in public
that's a real thing that happened you
could go check it yourself right i'm
paraphrasing a little bit
but go check it yourself you can hear in
her own words
you can hear the question you can hear
the full answer
and her full answer was basically
that
the cdc would recommend let's see and
again i'm paraphrasing
but the way i understood it is very
clearly that she's saying
we will we prefer giving shots to people
who don't need them
because it's easier to explain hey
everybody just go get your shot
i think she said it directly
are we done with them
i mean i don't know how much more done
you could be with an organization after
an answer like that
you should be fired immediately for that
answer
well
unless it's true
if it's true then there's something more
aggressive that needs to be done with
the cdc
but if she's the only one saying it or
maybe she was in charge of the decision
i guess
i think you need to be fired immediately
for that
that that that is that is uh escorted
out the door kind of fired
that's not even
you know meet me for a meeting on friday
fired
that's basically meet you in the parking
lot on the way back to work from the
interview
and asked corey you out the door except
i don't know who would do it because
she's the boss
who escorts the boss out the door the
president
i don't know how does the director of
the cdc even get picked
a huge escort because she's hot
that is the funniest thing about the
director of the cdc
a lot of the men have a crush on her
she she is insanely uh sexy that's true
but i i will agree with that
interpretation whatever else you want to
say about her
well
um eventbrite
the
online organization that lets you buy
tickets for stuff apparently they've
been taking down
events
for
viewing parties and stuff for the matt
walsh
documentary what is a woman
they say it promoted hatred
now i haven't seen the entire
documentary
but
isn't he just asking questions
my understanding is that the documentary
involves him
asking people
who have a different opinion to explain
their opinion
and i think he gives them time to
explain their whole opinion
am i wrong
isn't the the entire documentary is
about having his
having his opponents
have a full opportunity to explain their
opinion
and that's considered hate
do you think we've overshot the mark
here a little bit
now i always say that you don't have to
worry too much about the slippery slope
because it's always temporary like this
is definitely an overreaction
this is definitely too far you've taken
it too far now
it's amazing that that could be
considered to hate
to listen to people in their own words
tell you what they want
all right
um
so uh biden tweeted i guess yesterday
we're going to build the future in
america with american workers in
american factories
using american-made products
now who does that sound like
uh
yeah
we're
it sounds like the transition to orange
brandon is complete
like i
you know i told you
when biden took office i told you that
he was going to have to
end up doing the same things that trump
does or else fail
because a lot of things trump did were
just working so if you did the opposite
thing
you know it wouldn't last long you're
gonna have to go back to doing what
trump was doing because it worked
and here we here we are with uh orange
brandon
basically saying make america great
again he's just using his own words
so he could not be more american first
america first
uses america versus truman
isn't he
or at least he's trying to be now he's
not america first in ukraine but at
least in this this respect
all right remember i uh told some of you
i had this weird uh
medical mystery which is why i feel fine
most of the time but when i try to write
on my laptop i fall asleep within a
minute it has nothing to do with sleep
doesn't matter if i've well slept or
haven't slept at all it's exactly the
same experience
and so a lot of people
in the what i call the collaborative
intelligence of whatever it is we're
doing here
a lot of doctors
um
weighed in
and
it does
turn out that there are studies of
glucose and it does make you more
mentally alert
so if they give you glucose and coffee
before a mental challenge you'll do
better
than either nothing or coffee alone so
glucose
actually is brain fuel
and there's there's something i've
always imagined to be true about me
and this sort of confirm well it's more
evidence of it
and you know how some people
have the muscle structure where they can
sprint
really quickly but they might not be
good for long distance running
right and vice versa some people have
muscles that are fast twitch it might be
good for a reflex sport like ping pong
but not so good to be a weight lifter or
something
and i've always imagined that my brain
had that similar
quality
which is that i feel like i can go
really deep for very short periods of
time
like deeper than other people can go but
only for short periods because it's so
intense it's just exhausting
but what i can do what i can't do well
is focus on something for a long period
of time
i can't do that
but if you give me you know 10 minutes
of insane concentration on something
i can i can penetrate the center of the
planet
but you tell me to spend two hours doing
some homework i can't do that
i can't do that
i don't think that's adhd i don't think
i have those symptoms exactly i mean i
get distracted like other people do but
that's about it
yeah
so i'm going to test this
i'm going to test the theory that
sugaring myself up would keep me awake
in those situations i'll let you know
i'll let you know what happens
all right so apparently republicans are
planning to go on an impeachment and
investigation uh
frenzy should the republicans take
control of everything after
various elections
and what do you think of that idea do
you think republicans should pay back
the democrats for all these
investigations and
impeachments
is payback a good idea or a bad idea
because the trouble is it doesn't seem
to produce
um
[Music]
mutually assured destruction does it
it if mutually assured destruction is
what we were talking about then i'd say
yes
you have to make it look like it's such
a bad idea to do it to you
that they'll never do it again
but that's not going to happen right
i think the investigations really they
impact one person at a time
and all the people who are not invested
investigated think oh i'm going to
investigate your team because you got
one of mine
i don't think there's a there's no
mutually assured destruction
it's just mutually assured
 with each other and that doesn't
stop you from with each other
does it
to me it looks like it's just making
things worse
but on the other hand
can you let people put you in jail and
not respond
can you let people like destroy lives
and take over the country and you know
i mean do really big big things and just
not respond to say well
we're going to play polite
i don't know
this one's a tough one
i don't think there's a general answer i
think i think it depends on the
specifics
so if there are specific people who
really cross the line well you got to do
something but i don't think we should
make it a a habit to just like try to
savage the other side when you win that
seems like a bad bad strategy
uh how do you feel about bullies i don't
know if it's a bully question
is it
see the trouble is that if you beat up a
bully it does stop the bullying
that's why people do it
but this this wouldn't stop anything
there's no amount of impeachment from
one side that's going to stop the other
side from impeaching
so
the whole uh bully model doesn't make
sense
if i yeah if you ask me should you beat
up your bully i'd say probably
it sort of depends on the situation but
probably you should probably take a run
at it
but i don't think it's going to work
in the political context
so we'll see
wall street journal is reporting that at
least anecdotally
people are saying that the workplace is
less polite than it used to be
and part of it is the work at home part
of it was the pandemic part of it was
you know lots of speculation
[Music]
many of you think that's true
i don't know how many of you are
if you're listening right now you're
probably not back to work necessarily
but um do you believe that i'm looking
at your comments here
and
some people believe it but a lot of
people say it's not true
so there are more people saying it's not
true than true
not here yeah it must be very specific
young people are not taught to be polite
there's something to that it might also
be how many young people work there
right
it could be a generational thing
because
if you took two years out of my work
life when i was 25
that would be like
half of all of my work life
right
but if you but if you give me a two-year
pandemic and i'm already 50
that two years isn't going to change my
basic nature
but it might change your basic nature if
you just started working
lack of social socialization because of
technology
yeah i'm not sure this is a real thing
you know every generation thinks that
the generation coming up
is a disaster
has that ever been different
has there ever been a time when we said
whoa we were pretty bad but this new
generation they look like they have it
going on
i don't think that's a thing i think we
always think that the new generation is
doomed
there's a lot more ghosting going on
in the business world have you noticed
that
there's a salesperson who says people
just like don't call them back after
they seemed interested
do you think there's more of that
i feel like there's more ghosting
yeah
and part of that is just people are
busier
it's just too hard to get back to
everybody these days
all right well china has passed the u.s
in life expectancy
uh do you want to take any guesses why
that might be
talk about a story that's annoying
hey
look how good china's doing they passed
the united states in life expectancy
all right well i hate to
put a negative spin on that awesome
story
but it's because they're killing people
in america
they're killing americans with fentanyl
if you took that out i think it'd be a
lot a lot more competitive
so um
somebody asked somebody on twitter said
why don't we uh coerce
or encourage the mexican government
to use their own military to take out
the cartels
to which i said
wow
you're really not paying attention
there's no mexican government that's not
a thing
who thinks there's a mexican government
the cartels own the government
if you didn't know that you must be
really confused
about everything that's going on
if mexico had a functional government
nothing would look the same
you wouldn't have a border problem you
wouldn't have the drugs coming over in
the numbers that they are
yeah no there's no mexican government
not in a real sense
they're just clients of the cartels
so
when you say what are what are the
mexican people or the mexican government
going to say
if united states made a direct military
attack on the cartels
the answer is what's the difference
what's the difference what they say
how could that possibly have any impact
on us
only if we wanted to
because we would be attacking the
government in a sense because the
cartels are the real power there
so it doesn't matter what the you know
official functioning government says
that's who we're attacking we're
attacking the government
so am i telling you that the united
states should attack
the
the de facto government of mexico yeah
yeah that's what i just said
just as clearly as you could possibly
hear it we should send a major military
expedition down there and just either
occupy it
occupy it
or destroy whatever resources are
sending all that death into america
now some say
and this is a good point that we
wouldn't know what to bomb
because i don't know could you find the
exact lab that makes
fentanyl
it's probably like one building
somewhere it'd be hard to find but i
feel like we could find it but that's
not really what you you do you take out
the cartel leadership
right you make it so that they can't
possibly
enjoy the fruits of their labor and then
you try to talk and talk them into
going legit
you try to talk the the cartels
into
turning their money into some legitimate
businesses like the way the mafia did
right basically you get them to open
casinos
instead of
selling drugs because you can make money
either way
something like that right
something like that now the other
possibility is that you hire one of the
cartels to kill the other one
i'm surprised we haven't done that
actually it's because the cartels are
only in it for the money right
so you couldn't hire one of the cartels
to secure the border
they'd have to kill the other cartel but
if you paid them enough they'd do it
did they make so much money by smuggling
people in that they wouldn't take a
direct bribe from the united states look
here's the deal
you're making a billion dollars a year
smuggling people into our country
we'll pay you 1.2 to stop doing it and
kill anybody who tries it
like oh that's another 200 million okay
we're in
anyway i think the attack on china is so
inevitable that it's ridiculous that we
don't just plan it and do it now
it's not like we're not going to do it
be serious do you think we're not going
to attack mexico because of course we
are
of course we are
there's a 100 chance we are
we are going to militarily attack mexico
you have to you're going to have to
accept this
it's only a matter of when there's no
other question
that the question of will we attack
mexico is done that's done
we are going to attack mexico
and we're going to go hard
i just don't know when
could be five years
who knows
there's a video of a robot
allegedly seeing itself in a mirror for
the first time an ai driven robot
and when you look at it
it's not immediately obvious if the
robot is having some kind of
internal
if i can call it mental
reaction
or if it's just programmed to act the
way it's acting
it's hard to tell
but but i said the following
if a robot can recognize itself in the
mirror it's conscious
unless
it has simply been programmed to
reconcile recognize itself in the mirror
right
if it's been programmed specifically act
this way
when you see a reflection that doesn't
mean anything
but if it came to that on its own
let's say you had programmed it in a
general sense so it had a general idea
of things and then you showed it a
mirror
and if it looked in the mirror
and if it knew
that it was seeing itself
it would at that moment understand that
it is unique among the world
right
you would understand that its
understanding of itself was somehow in
itself
and coming from itself
and that itself was different
and distinct from the rest of the world
and it would also have the beginning of
a sense of how it fit into the whole
to me that's consciousness
to me that's consciousness
now you could disagree
but it's sort of subjective
yeah i think if you understand your
place
in the universe
you're conscious
and i think that the feeling of
consciousness which is different there's
a sensation that you have internally
that feeling of consciousness
which i think is different from
being conscious
because i think you could be conscious
without the internal feeling
probably
but i think the internal feeling is
nothing but
predicting what's going to happen in the
next moment
and then
judging whether it happened or not and
the difference between what happened and
what you thought would happen that
little friction
the difference that's your feeling of
consciousness that's it
it's just the difference between what
you thought was going to happen in the
next moment and what actually happened
and here's how you know this is true
you ready for this
imagine living in a world where
everything that happens you knew in
advance
everything so you know that
i'm gonna pick up this napkin and wave
it at you you knew that in advance you
knew that i was going to turn around in
advance you knew that i was going to
take a drink in advance
how long would it take
for your consciousness to disappear
think about it
if everything happened the way you
expected it to how long would it take
you for to lose consciousness forever
it would happen right away
you would have no consciousness
because there would be nothing happening
your brain wouldn't need to be engaged
because everything that happens you
understand
so you wouldn't even have to pay
attention to the real world
it would just become some internal
process
you basically would lose consciousness
so the difference between your
prediction and what happens is the only
thing keeping you awake
that's it
yeah the more you understand about ai
the less impressive it is that's exactly
right but i would say that that i would
put that in a graph
i would say that when you first start
learning about ai it's it's more and
more impressive
it's more and more impressive it's like
ah man that is so impressive
until you reach a really high
understanding
and then all of the impressiveness
disappears
because once you realize it's just
mechanical
and you realize that you're just
mechanical too
that's when you
ascend to the next level of awareness
which by the way
let me do a fact check here
in
2015-16 or so i predicted that the
entire world
was going to
have an awareness shift
did it happen
did it happen
do you think that the whole world
has changed their awareness
like we've reached a level of awareness
that we we were not at yeah
because now we understand how fake
everything is
in a way we did not understand and trump
did that
trump did that for himself
all right here's the
next thing i want to say about robots
and this is really really important
for the future
you know the people who are predicting
climate change in 80 years
let me ask you did you see this coming
the next thing i'm going to talk about
there there are still people who believe
that only a few people will fall in love
with robots
and they'd be like the weirdos
you know the same ones were
have a relationship with a blow up doll
is that what you think
you're all going to fall in love with
robots
you don't see that coming
you don't know that all humans are going
to fall in love with the robots to the
point where
making love to a human will be so
undesirable
it's so undesirable
it's not even going to be close
see the thing that you think that's
completely wrong
is that the robot can never compete with
a real live human
oh my god that's so wrong
you know all the like the movie all
right i know you're gonna
can i ask you something please
stop making movie and book references
while i talk about this
just stop it
i will i will stipulate there have been
movies
and books
roughly on this topic
just stop stop making reference to them
please it's just so boring
and i can't stand it when i see them go
by in the comments every movie reference
i say i just god
god just anything but that anything but
that
just say something that's not obvious
right
just don't say the most obvious thing in
the situation and by the way this is a
very good tip
for improving your social standing
just figure out what's the most obvious
thing somebody would say in a situation
and don't say that
just don't say that you can say anything
else or you could be quiet just just
don't say the most obvious thing please
and other people will appreciate it they
really will
um
so yeah you're all going to fall in love
with robots and the reason is
if you ever seen anybody fall in love
with a dog
it's a thing
spend about 10 minutes looking at uh pet
videos on instagram
and you can see that people have
relationships with their dogs
that are basically a human to human
relationship for all practical purposes
yeah
you don't think we're going to fall in
love with robots
yes they're going to be way kinder
they will never be they will
never criticize you
they will compliment you they will build
up your esteem they will be helpful
they will always care about you if
they're programmed that way
they will put you first
they will take care of you they'll make
you a sandwich they'll tuck you into bed
they'll have sex with you when you want
to have sex not when when they won't
have sex
it's never it's not going to be close
there's no way humans can compete with
that
not even close
now here's my prediction about the look
of robots you ready for this
hologram heads
hologram heads
because every time we make a robot head
it looks like a robot of course and when
they make the ones that look like a
human but it's like animatronic
you're never going to get all of the
nuance in a robotic head
that a real human has
so
it's going to be a cgi
and you're going to have here's what
it's going to look like it's going to be
a physical robot
but from the neck up
it'll be a hologram
because the hologram can have infinite
variety
and then you can just deep fake it and
it will look exactly like a person you
know the lips will match the
everything
so it's holograph it's going to be
holographic heads
and you'll also be able to change the
head
just change the program and you'll have
a different face
so you'll be able to buy your robot
and then from a list of choices you'll
be able to dial dial in which face you
want to have it will change its face as
you dial it
and then
and then you go from that
all right
how does a hologram give you head
uh
well
i think i'm not going to go down that
road but let's just say
well i'm going to answer the question
i'm going to give you one word to google
to answer all of your questions about
sex with robots
fleshlight
not flashlight
flesh
f-l-e-s-h
flashlight if you don't know what that
is google it
if you say to yourself
my god no artificial piece of plastic or
silicon or whatever the hell they make
it out of no piece of artificial
anything
would feel as good as a human
well then i would suggest maybe you try
it because you'd be surprised
no it's better than a human
that's right
even the physical
part where the humans connect
yeah the artificial one's going to be
better than the real one
not even close
the artificial one will be better than a
real one not even close
maybe it isn't there yet
but it's not going to be close
i mean at the very least it'll be
designed for your size if you know what
i mean
so everything's going to fit perfectly
all right
um
starbucks has been uh discriminated
against white men
uh at least that's what i read between
the lines
so i guess they're getting a lot of
pushback
about their
esg and their dei
um
that's right so if you're in a
corporation you're worrying about your
dei and your esg
but if you're in a school it's your crt
and are you confused yet
yeah so the dei is diversity equity
inclusion
but that's part of
the esg which is environmental social
and governance
so it makes me wonder if in their
company they have anybody who's in
charge of
dei
who's having fights with whoever's in
charge of esg
and they're having big debates about
where their responsibilities overlap
i hope so
i hope they're fighting over where their
responsibilities overlap
yeah it is funny that dei they have to
put the
the words in that order because
otherwise it's d-i-e and that's a that's
a bad acronym
um
but apparently
starbucks has explicitly said they're
gonna
hire um
minority i guess minority would be the
right word minority applicants or people
who have less opportunity
as they see it so basically they just
said they're not going to hire white men
right am i interpreting that wrong
and they're acting like that's perfectly
legal
perfectly legal
one of the biggest employers in the
country oh we're just not going to hire
a white man anymore
we're going to make sure that we've got
our
esg and our dei cooking
so i think uh once you've got an acronym
within an acronym um
you know you've gone too far
so
so i'm going to keep hammering at the
esg and
in fact i took this down this is going
to be my next series of jokes
will be the dilbers company trying to
figure out what is diversity equity and
inclusion and how is that different from
environmental social governance and how
the hell can they make all that work
unless they just discriminate against
white people
let me ask you this do you think i can
do a dilbert comic where dilberg is
fired for being a white guy
do you think is the world ready for it
yet
oh
oh
i'm having a moment right now
all right let me tell you what's going
on in my head
there are moments in my life
and i'm having one right now where i can
see my future so clearly
i didn't want to see this one
because as soon as i said can i get away
with having dilbert fired because he's a
white man
i realized i have to do it
i can't not do it
dilbert's gonna get fired for being a
white man
oh man
that should be the end of my career what
do you think
that that probably is the end of my
career
but i have to do it i have to do it
i have to do it
i have to do it
am i wrong i mean you maybe you can't
feel it from your perspective on this
but i can't not do it
i have to do it
it was always meant to happen was it
i'm not happy about this at all
because it's sort of a big weight
i really have to do it don't i
you agree right
no matter what happens to me i have to
do this don't i it's like the universe
kind of put this on me
you know i always suffer from the
spider-man problem you know the
spider-man problem
you all know the spider-man problem
right
with great power comes great
responsibility
and
you know
that comes in way before great power you
know if you have any power at all you
have responsibility
but i feel like
i feel like
this needs to be done
like it doesn't feel like it's about me
anymore
it feels like
this feels like i was put here to do
this
god i feel
am i wrong
do you feel it
can you see it
let me ask you this
i have this theory that the more clearly
you can imagine a potential future the
more likely it's going to happen
do you see this as clearly as i do
that i have to do that
i just have to don't i
i can't tell you how much this bothers
me because i feel like it's completely
taken out of my control
i i feel like the universe just said
yeah you just stand over there for a
minute
i know you'd like to take care of this
yourself but this one was decided a long
time ago
you know a long time ago when you were
being
abused in your job for being a white man
and you created a comic which became
you know internationally known
about a white man
that this this moment had to come didn't
it
it was like it was all leading to this
wasn't it
it was all leading to this
wow god
i hate that
all right here's another one to make
your head spin you know i always quote
twitter account machiavelli's underbelly
especially for all the ai stuff
and uh
he uh tweets this
uh he said that it needs to come out
during the elon musk versus twitter
trial that twitter has known that
advanced gtp three level bots meaning ai
had infiltrated the site
and were indistinguishable for humans
for at least a decade
foreign and domestic bots aimed at
manipulating the public via social proof
now i would quibble with at least the
decade part
but
when i read this i thought to myself
that would explain everything
have you had any conversations with
twitter users who you weren't sure were
real people
i have
and i feel like they were interactive
but
but i wrote it off to them being from
another country
like sometimes it was that their answers
were a little off or something and i
think oh it's because they were
they're not even native english speakers
so they're just getting by as well as
they can
they may have been ai
they may have been ai
have i ever told you that i tried to
figure out why there was a similarity
to my trolls
have you seen the similarity
they all come over and say oh the the
garfield cartoonist because they make
fun of who i actually do a cartoon about
right
now it could be that they're just npcs
it's just they're just people who just
say the most obvious thing
could be just that
but
they also come over and they make fun of
my dead stepson
have you seen that that's one of the
most common critiques i get doesn't
matter what the comment will be
somebody will come into the comments and
say so uh
how'd that work with your stepson
now
are there enough people who were like
that ugly that humans would be doing
that on a regular basis probably i mean
there's a good chance
but
i don't think you can rule out the fact
that whatever the public knows about ai
is several years
past what ai can do
so if china let's let's just pick a
country as a for instance if china had
ai that could do this sign up to twitter
and tweet on a on a certain topic
if it could do that it would have done
it right
because you don't want humans having to
you know they get cancelled and they
have to reopen a new account and
you'd want the ai to be just sitting
there opening new accounts if they get
identified they just open a new one
they can keep ahead of twitter's
algorithm just by brute force
so it seems to me that
let's put it this way
the ai technology that i'm aware of now
is either very close or already could
pretend to be a person on twitter
would you accept that
that the ai we know about publicly that
you and i already know about
is either already able to do that or
right on the cusp of being able to do it
right
so that's the first assumption and most
of you say yes to that then the second
assumption is that whatever a government
could do with ai
we don't know yet
meaning that there's a
secret
knowledge that's ahead of the public
now if an intelligence agency for a big
country had that ability
and they could just weaponize it by just
turning it on
and say hey i get an idea
go make it make a bunch of twitter
accounts and
advocate against the following people
so that ai would go out and figure out
all right what do we know about the
following people it would look for other
criticisms
and then whenever uh
you know have you ever noticed that
whenever eric swalwell tweets anything
on any topic
somebody goes into the comments and says
well what about fang fang
have you noticed that
and what is the most obvious thing that
you could say to a swalwell comment
what about fighting fang what about
fagging fight right it's the most
obvious thing
if you ever make a fang fang joke
about eric's wall well it's not extra
clever
if it's actually clever that's okay but
if it's just a fang fang reference
don't do that anymore
just just stop that
it annoys me every time i see it only
because the lack of creativity that's
all
you know i get that it's valid it's a
valid point
totally valid point but i'm just so
tired of it
anyway uh i would not be surprised if we
someday find out that a lot of our
nemesis
nemesis
our nemeses on twitter we're actually ai
it's very possible
i'm not going to say probable
but it's
certainly up in the
you know
close to 50 range or heading in that
direction
nemisi
is that the plural
the many nemesis
all right
ladies and gentlemen
that
was the most amazing
nearly an hour of live stream content
completely ad hoc
off the cuff improvised
now question
for all of you
um somebody needs to um
warn me when i start losing my mind
can i ask you to do that
seriously
right because i probably won't retire
retire in the normal way like i'm not
just going to go golf
so i'll do i'll probably do this
or some version of public communication
beyond the time that i should
you know that's coming right
i'll definitely do this longer than i
should because i'll be the last one to
know
so i'm going to depend on you
to tell me when you think i'm losing it
is that fair
you know we have this collaborative
intelligence that we formed in which my
intelligence
be that as it may
is expanded by you know your input and
contribution to it
so uh i can't judge my own mental
fitness
i mean maybe i can maybe i'll notice it
in myself
but some people have uh mentioned to me
that they were already concerned
now the examples they gave didn't didn't
really
make sense to me as something to be
concerned about but i'm going to put it
to you
if you see me losing a step that doesn't
seem just purely age related that's
different
let me know
let me know
now i realize that i'm you know going to
kick off a bunch of trolls we're just
going to start saying it from you know
every day from now on but i'll look at
the you know the people that i see
enough
you know i recognize enough of you that
if it's somebody i know or even just
know from twitter i'm gonna take it
seriously
right if somebody i know who's been
watching me a long time says uh you keep
having these memory gaps or whatever it
is
now the memory one's gonna be tough
because my memory has never been good
right
so somebody recently pointed out what
they thought was a memory fault of mine
but i'm pretty sure it was a memory
fault of theirs
so can't solve that one
uh a code word i don't think we need
that
yeah all right
well so that's uh that's my request is
to let me know when you think i've lost
it okay
let me tell you my uh current internal
impression of my own
current intelligence
here's what i think
i've definitely
you know the age has definitely done
the predictable thing
which is my ability to learn is probably
it feels like it might be lower than it
used to be
now i still learn things
i mean i'm still learning the drums and
i'm still learning a bunch of other
stuff so every day i'm still learning
things and i don't i don't feel like
it's necessarily harder than it used to
be sometimes it feels easier because i
have more framework to connect things to
but
i also have more
of a deeper talent stack than any time
in my life
because i'm always adding adding little
micro talents to the list
so to me it seems like i'm more
more capable now than at any time in my
life
but not because my brain is as quick as
it was in my 20s
but rather because it has
it's been designed over time
to have a certain structure
that seems to work real well for the
stuff i do
so to me to me my functional
intelligence is the highest it's ever
been
functional
just because of the combination of
talents
but i don't i don't think my native
quickness is is the same i think that's
taken ahead
and i also think that because the nature
of my work
which is extremely intellectual
that sound that sounded more egotistical
than i meant it the the nature of my
work is that it happens in my head let's
put it that way
all right the the intellectual thing
sounds like i'm complimenting myself but
yeah most of my work happens in my head
it's creativity so i think
that that gives me an edge in longevity
mental longevity if everything we know
about brains is true
the more you use it you know the
more it'll last
i don't think many people use their
brain more than i do
i mean it get to the point where
my head hits my keyboard from exhaustion
and that's just mental exhaustion
so
when i'm looking at the the news in the
morning
i'm not sure how much you can appreciate
this but
you know each of these news stories
i've got to go deep enough in them
intellectually
that i can find an angle that would be
interesting
that's not easy
it's like a whole bunch of different
stories every day then the rest of the
day i've got a
i've got to write some cartoons
i'll probably look at my next micro
lessons and i'll create for
for the locals platform i've got to go
work on my book
which is
85 different topics so far
just think about that my book is like 85
different topics
so far
it's pushing toward a hundred
because each of them is a reframe that
has to be talked about individually
so on any given day
i'm going to look at i don't know
20 news stories
85
topics in a book
maybe a deep dive on some topic for
locals
plus how much i tweet during the day
plus designing a coffee cup
let me give you an update on the
coffee mug
so uh erica who is nice enough to
coordinate this
uh came up with a design which
i asked my artist assistant to
clean up
and i'll show it to you
so this is this is the current
um front of the mug design
what do you think
comments comments then the back would be
the
simultaneous sip
well erica
good job look at all those people agree
okay
all right
good
now
here here's a perfect reason why i would
not be the best one to do this
that this is actually working better
than i had hoped you have it making a
group effort
um there there's a an exercise that i
always ask people to do
which is look at anybody's logo for any
product
any logo for any product i'll just
randomly pick one
all right here's this water
they've got this logo on here and then i
ask you if you were in charge would you
have approved this logo
and the answer would be probably not
you would have been like
that's kind of boring and you know
whatever and that's true of every logo
like everybody's you know
uh logo
you can't find two people who like the
same thing
it's very hard
so there's something about this
maybe the simplicity of it and the fact
that it's you know it's so on point i
guess
that uh
i know i think this this collaborative
effort is much better because i don't
think i could come up with this on my
own
all right
yeah i guess it all makes sense
um
versus kilroy
the bug should be black
okay have simple logo maybe just glasses
and simple arc
yeah you know
here here are all the things you have to
worry about with the logo
if you want a logo that's going to last
you have to ask your question
ask questions like this
how long will people still be wearing
glasses
right
i hate having glasses being part of your
logo because they will change over time
but for now i mean i've gone this long
i put garfield on it
all right
take a river cruise through europe
that's the top of my list for things
that i would enjoy doing a river cruise
in europe while they still have rivers
apparently the rivers in europe are
have gone down so much
by the way where is all the water going
wait how does this
work so is the water coming out of the
streams and lakes and going into the
ocean because the
the water level of the ocean is going up
but the water level of all of our
land-based
water is going down
can can the climate really do that can
it really take water from one place and
put it in another place
i suppose that's what climate change
does it probably does exactly that yeah
i guess it does
yeah
okay
well that's where we're at at the moment
and ladies and gentlemen
this concludes the youtube portion of
our
event
and
i'm describing clouds you're right
and i'll talk to you tomorrow youtube
bye for now
