hey everybody
come on in
yep it's time for the evening edition of
coffee with scott adams there might
actually be some coffee
it looks like youtube's a little
slow but it's kicking in
hey everybody so you're watching uh
you're watching
the two different worlds unfold
don't make the mistake of watching
only fox news or only cnn tonight
because i'm here to tell you that
they're electing different presidents
so you gotta you go to fox and they're
talking about uh florida's looking good
for president trump
and then you switch over oh let me
let me tweet that i'm live then you
switch over to cnn and they're only
showing you the states where biden is
looking good
all right i'm looking at your comments
to see how worried you are
i see worried excited uh
somebody loves me
that's good to know oh yeah mark
schneider's uh back on uh
he's back on twitter so he's he's been
unbanned
my nerves are activated you were a
psychic
well i'm not a psychic until i'm right
so will you join me in an evening
beverage
i'm not going to do the the toast
because that's sort of a morning thing
but if you have a beverage it doesn't
have to be coffee
if you know what i mean and
this would be the time to join me in the
simultaneous evening sip
go
i feel trump's numbers improving in the
panhandle
yes that's how good that sip was
so uh
somebody says they're immensely excited
worried gulp
so here here's the question i would give
you
there's absolutely nothing that we're
going to hear in the next hour
that's going to tell you who is going to
be president so
for now it's just sort of fun everything
that you see is sort of like a horoscope
is entertaining but it might not be that
you know scientific uh somebody says
trump is winning virginia so far
i think virginia was already called for
biden unless i'm
incorrect but that might be based on
history not based on votes
all right somebody says their wife says
hi well
tell your wife hey because that's not
too weird
all right um
do we have a lot of people watching a
lot of people coming in
now honestly i didn't have much to talk
about
i didn't make a few notes but i just
wanted to sort of
share the moment does this did you find
today that
there was a weird time dilation
that things were moving quickly
and slowly at the same time
did you have that experience today you
know i couldn't wait
to find out how it turns out so in that
way everything was going slowly
but at the same time i was thinking wait
wait wait it's election day
everything's happening too quickly
so that part is weird um
i i told my smart democrat friend who i
talk about all the time
and again for those of you who are new
to it the reason i talk about him is
that he's
very smart and well informed and we
disagree completely
now if he were just stupid it would be
easy to know why we disagree or at least
i would have a theory
but because he's smart it's more fun to
talk to him because when he has a
different opinion
i have learned that it's because he has
different information in most cases
or he's been brainwashed by the
mainstream media to have tds
so i told him that i showed him an
article that agreed with me
that it's possible for the mainstream
media to simply claim that biden won
i just claimed he won and he thought
that that was pure stupidity
that there's no way the mainstream media
could be part of a coup to overthrow the
government
just by claiming something was true that
wasn't true
now anybody who actually knows what
happened with the russia collusion story
or lots of the other hoaxes
knows that the the mainstream media has
proven
beyond any doubt that they can do
exactly that
they can make you think something's true
that's not true
now they can't convince everybody but
can they convince enough people
and i think they're going to take a and
take a run at it if
if if trump wins and they can make any
argument whatsoever that there is an
irregularity i think they're going to
take a run at it
so you saw the uh the footage of the
white house
was putting new fencing around the white
house and
somebody showed a picture of a sniper on
the
on the roof of the white house but
what happens if you know what happens if
there are just too many people there
protesting
could get interesting and not in a good
way
but my prediction is that there will be
trouble
there will be you know some amount of
looting and whatever
opportunistically but that there will
not be anything like a civil war
and part of the reason is i tweeted it
earlier the reason it won't be a civil
war is that conservatives
won't fight offensively so
you sort of need both sides to want to
fight now
the conservatives would certainly fight
defensively
but you sort of need both sides to be a
little bit aggressive to get a proper
civil war going
and there just isn't that kind of energy
or intention
on the right um oh just to be clear
this is what i'm thinking i think that
at some point
between now and inauguration day
that fox news will declare trump has won
and cnn will declare that biden won does
anybody
want to take that bat so the bet is
that sometime between now and
inauguration
the two networks will call a different
president as president
now they might not do it as directly as
i just said
so there might be one who is direct and
the other one is just
strongly leaning toward but it's going
to sort of look like
we have two presidents at the same time
here's a thought for you there's a
there's a non-zero chance i don't know
what the odds are
that we could have three different
presidents before
before uh you know the end of january
right so if biden won
that would give us two presidents
between now and the end of january
and if biden stepped down for whatever
reason
and kamala harris stepped up
it could happen by the end of january we
could have three different presidents by
the end of january
and i don't think that's a great idea
i see uh nathaniel says scott's coup
idea is absurd
it's absurd you know let me put it in
context for you
would you have said it was absurd that
there would be
a russia collusion hoax that would
you know completely brainwashed part of
the
the population into thinking that the
sitting president
was a russian asset if i had told you
that before it happened
would you thought wouldn't you think
that was a little absurd
and it didn't happen accidentally it
happened because people put a lot of
work into that
plot it's the same people it's exactly
the same people
and now they've test driven the process
and it works
they can convince something like 40 to
50 percent of the public
of absolutely anything and they can
convince the public of that even if
there's a transcript
that you could just google and look at
and see that the story is not true
we saw that yeah there's no doubt that
they can do it
they did it right in front of you and
they did it multiple times
talk about texas somebody says uh talk
about what about texas
so it looks like uh uh trump is pulling
ahead in florida
and the panhandle hasn't been counted
yet and that should go for trump
so it looks like trump has florida
the very early voting i'm just looking
at some of the
coverage coming in and so this doesn't
mean anything because it's just way too
early
but uh trump was up in michigan uh
up in georgia uh
with 26 in he's up in virginia
so now i'm i'm looking at cnn so
interestingly they've shown a whole
bunch of states where trump is
is up by a lot now i don't think that
these numbers
um are expected to hold
i think that a lot of these will reverse
not a lot of them but some of them might
somebody says so if trump wins will nate
silver go away
well i don't think so because i think if
trump wins
it will be just like last time do you
remember when trump won
last time and there were i think
cnn printed 14 reasons or something
why why hillary clinton lost so
no matter which way it goes yeah i still
think it's going to go for trump tonight
but if trump wins
the news will be you know 25
different reasons why something went
wrong and why it was a fluke and
you know why it happened and why it's
all racists and
why there was uh you know voter
suppression
and just about every other thing
i see in the comments somebody says ohio
is having some issues
so somebody says talk about ohio
people are all mad i actually have no
idea what's happening in ohio
except that it's showing right now with
biden way up
was that the problem the problem was
that uh
oh that that doesn't look real does it
is that the problem that ohio doesn't
look real
the results there so again it's early so
i don't think you can take
too much from that so i'm not going to
take too much of it seriously but i do
think
the president has probably is going to
do well in florida
fox news and google both saying virginia
went to biden but counting trump
is 500 ahead yeah
so that's how much they can flip around
that trump can go from way up to not way
up
late voting in ohio is heavy trump why
is everybody so
so worked up about ohio
the only thing we know about ohio is
that we don't know how it's going to
turn out
but you all seem pretty worked up about
ohio
somebody says oh how it doesn't look
good i just don't think you can tell
i just don't think you can tell
uh unless kanye is doing really well in
ohio
um thank you mike for saying that
scott science much whatever that means
whatever that means that's the most 2020
comment
of all time in the comments on youtube
somebody just said
uh scott science much guess that covers
it
there's nothing else to say do you
science much
i science more than you do i'll see your
science and all
all up your science so up yours your
science
um
ohio blue city is probably dumped first
yeah i think that's part of the story is
that
cities and rural voting places
are going to report at different rates
so don't worry about any of that
yet i don't think you should worry
if somebody says if biden wins watch
everything magically reopen
well you know glenn greenwald was
reminding
us that in 2009
right after obama got
into office uh i think
that the protests that were happening at
the time like um
what was that the uh wall street
whatever whatever those protests were
uh occupy wall street all those protests
just sort of stopped when
biden or when uh obama got into office
right
so it does seem as though
they can come and go fairly quickly so
we don't know what will happen
um some new gingrich says ohio
always looks like the democrats are
going to win early
somebody says in the comments and if
somebody says it in the comments
well you know it's real you know it's
true
blood pressure is somebody's blood
pressure
first live periscope well i'm glad you
could make it
all right uh fox give trump a 93
probability in florida as somebody says
what do i think about the so-called
scorecard algorithm to steal
votes
here's what i think here's a little rule
that i
have in my book loser thing for deciding
what is real
and it goes like this if if you just
take cnn
and fox news as representative of the
left and the right
if something is reported the same on
both networks it's probably true
you know if they tell you a hurricane
hit puerto rico
and it's on both networks it's true
if one of them reports something is true
and the other reports
that it's not true might not be true
yeah it might not be true there's a much
higher chance that it's not true
if it's only reported as true on one it
doesn't matter which one
reports it is true if it's only one of
them
the odds are it's probably not true
so with this this rumor about some kind
of secret software that can change votes
that has not been reported yet has it
on fox news and has not been reported
yet
on cnn or any of the major uh media so i
think steve bannon
is so far the place that that has been
and then social media
so if you were going to say if you
didn't know even what the topic was
and the only thing i told you about it
is it looked like the biggest thing in
the world if it's true
so if true really really big
but neither fox nor cnn are treating it
as
true if that's all you knew is it true
chances are pretty far against it
that doesn't mean you know i know what's
happening i'm just saying that
under those circumstances you would
expect it not to be true
um but i will also expect that
somebody's at least tried
you know you know somebody's at least
tried to influence votes
with software all right let's see north
carolina
looks like trump is up in north carolina
texas biden's got a little bit of
advantage but the late votes we
expect will be trump right
so
well it's so good to see all of you too
slaughter meter is still at 100
so have you noticed that the only thing
that seems to
uh to speak against trump
is the polls and the polls are the
things that you trust the least
because they were wrong before so at
least in terms of the outcome they were
wrong
is that a coincidence that everything
that is non-scientific
appears to be pro-trump in terms of the
energy in the turnout at the rallies and
and stuff like that it just it just
feels like
uh you know i was just watching
tucker carlson say that if it turns out
that trump wins
it means that the entire polling pundit
punditry class
has a lot of explaining to do now not
all of them
because um rasmussen has the race close
and
you know trafalgar group says trump
would win so there's a few that would
look like stars
but uh there's a lot a lot of polling
companies get a lot to explain
if trump wins and at the moment i would
say
it's still looking like that but some of
that
some of that is because i've been
watching a little bit more of
fox news coverage so if
i spend 10 minutes watching cnn i'm
going to think biden's going to win i
guarantee it
somebody says scott calm me down man
well i think we're gonna be fine
now it looks to me like trump is gonna
win
and i would say handily at this point
anything could happen but i promise you
that no matter what happens
you'll be fine you'll be okay you know
we'll figure out
we'll figure out a way
and the one thing that we know we can't
trust
is the polls now
there there are some times when you can
feel something to be true that you can't
prove
and for me the the biggest thing that i
feel
that i just feel in in the you know
every
particle of my body feels that the
following thing is true
the republicans lied like crazy to
pollsters
uh now of course i've asked people on
twitter if they did and just hundreds of
people
said yes i lied to pollsters recently
which again is not scientific because
it's just the people following me on
twitter and
who knows if they're lying or telling
the truth or they just want to join in
who knows
but as sorta really really really
feels like people
lied like crazy into pollsters so
with that assumption i think uh trump
should win
the thing i'm most worried about is that
uh the democrats didn't want biden to
win
that that's the that's the one that
keeps me up
that the uh the nature of the op
is that biden is supposed to lose so
that that
activates the democrats and all the all
the rioters
but i think i think there's been enough
time for law enforcement to prep
that there will be some
fires and stuff tonight but you'll be
fine
just stay out of those areas
somebody says danville is red danville's
the town
next to me i don't think danville's red
i would bet that it is very blue
somebody says they predict a either a
trump or a kamala harris win
you know you can't count kamala harris
out yet
what would happen theoretically if
uh let's say biden and harris won just
theoretically
hypothetically and what would happen
if biden decided to drop out after he
won but before he was
sworn in what would be the proper
protocol in that case
would they just say well i guess it's
kamala
or is the fact that neither of them are
sworn in
make that not work
so what would happen i think i need a i
need a ruling on that
but i don't think it's going to happen i
find that it's impossible for me to
imagine a future
with a president biden or president
kamala harris like i just sort of can't
see it
which doesn't mean it's impossible i
just
i'd have to say that it's hard to
imagine i just imagine
trump winning for what that's worth very
unscientific
pollsters want to be right more than
they want biden to win
that doesn't seem to be true that
doesn't seem to be true
i i do not buy the by the assumptions
that pollsters need to be right
more than they want biden to end i don't
believe that at all
i think that some of them need to be
right
and that some of them have other
interests
why did my viewers go down from 10k to
5k
probably because i've got nothing to
offer here so i think i'm going to
sign off if there's anything breaking in
the news
that looks exciting i will come back and
join you
to talk about it but i think it's going
to be a long night
so i hope you've got your beverage and
i will catch up with you again
a little later tonight
you
