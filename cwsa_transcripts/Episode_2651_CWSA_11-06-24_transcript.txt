human brains all you need for that is a
copper M Glass a tanker chel or Stein a
canteen jug or flask of vessel of any

the unparallel pleasure the dopamin Ed h
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called that's
right the simultaneous
hip ladies and gentlemen if you don't
mind I'm going to
indulge a second zp to Victory
to the Golden
Age here's it to you
voters oh that's
good oh that is so so
good well did you know there's a study
from bayor University that says that uh
sleeping even 45 extra minutes can uh
make you have better feelings of
gratitude flourishing resilience and
pro-social
behavior so if you are going to sign on
today hoping to see a show in which I
would be displaying some let's see
gratitude flourishing resilience and
pro-social
behavior well I just have to tell you I
really didn't get 46 minutes of extra
sleep last night and neither did you and
yet
miraculously I'm in a terrific mood and
feeling very
gracious very full of gratitude mostly
for you mostly for
you well who is the happiest man in the
entire world
today that's right Joe
Biden Trump's pretty happy I think most
Trump supporters pretty happy JD Vance
pretty happy but the happiest person in
the
world Joe
Biden now I'm going to try not to be too
much of a jerk
today because I do think that a little
bit of social Unity is in order I
wouldn't mind a little social you know
Unity just a little bit but we're going
to enjoy ourselves today and I think the
Democrats are not going to be watching
this show and it won't hurt him a bit
but if you don't mind we're going to
Revel a little bit just a little bit of
reving we're going to be subtle about it
but boy are we going to enjoy our
Revel I think I've been telling you for
some time
now that the uh the most interesting
story is what usually happens if you're
looking to predict the future figure out
what would make the best story if it
were a movie or a book what would be the
best
ending and
miraculously that is often the actual
ending so sure enough as I've been
predicting now for several years Trump
was in for the best third Act of all
time now the third Act is a movie
structure uh reference where the third
Act is where everything is impossible
there's no way no way the the hero of
your movie could possibly survive this
situation
ation do you know what that was that was
January
6th that was a situation which when the
fake news was done with him and the the
lawyers were done with him and the
impeachers were done with him there was
no way no possible way no no way stop it
there was no way anybody under any
circumstance could possibly come back
from the January 6 debacle and
become the 47th president of the United
States and remember what I said to you I
said to you it's not
enough that's not enough that's a good
movie but it's not a great
movie a great movie would be that the
results of this year Andor The Observers
and the lawyers watching everything
found out for sure that 2020 had been
stolen a stolen
election that's the third act you think
that winning the election is the third
act well it is but the real third Act is
where you're
surprised Beyond just that he
survived now you're seeing a lot of
reports that are saying hey what
happened to all those Biden voters they
seem to have just disappeared
other people are saying like me I'm
saying this this morning hey wasn't
there supposed to be a part where the
votes were counted overnight and then
there'd be a large dump of votes from
some place we weren't sure about on
trucks we weren't clear about with
drivers who wouldn't say who they worked
for weren't we all expecting
that except one thing that was different
this time is that the RNC
Lara Trump and Michael Watley seem to
have done a really good job in
threatening people with
consequences in
Fielding an actual Army of lawyers and
watching everything that needed to be
watched is it possible and I'm not
willing to say that this is true yet is
it
possible that
the the rigging could have happened
happened if not for all the watching is
it
possible that uh this time nobody
tried is it possible that we're so bad
at counting that we think 20 million
voters are missing that somehow were
magically there for for Biden but now
they're
not how do you explain exactly that a uh
the first woman of color uh candidate
for president
who was you know knocking on the door
how do we explain she got fewer votes
than old man Joe Biden how do you really
do that and that's that's after January
6 that's after all the accusations about
Trump how do you still come up that
short well it's too early to say that
the cheat of 2020 has been revealed I
think U Steve banon is saying it I think
he's saying it's confirmed I believe is
looking at Pennsylvania in particular to
say uh there's no way that con Harris
got this many votes if it's also true
that Biden got that many votes a few
years
before so we're on the border we're on
the cusp of the greatest third act
comeback of all time now already it
might be the greatest even if there is
nothing about 2020 that we find out
that's you know sketchy even without it
it is still the greatest comeback in
politics that I think we've ever seen
it's truly
amazing and there's so much to say about
it but I'm going to start with my
favorite post on
X you
ready this is from the persistence Scott
presler this was last night Mr President
I'm pleased to share that we have
delivered
Pennsylvania
wow
wow it got me
yeah that was a that was quite a moment
wasn't
it quite a
moment I was doing okay until then I
have to admit I was doing
okay
but that was a Ela that was a ala thing
so uh Trump gave his uh Speech
acceptance speech I guess you call it
kind of
official and
uh he said this will truly be the Golden
Age
sorry that caught me off guard wasn't
expecting
that and uh Trump tells us we don't have
to live this way and that the golden age
is going to be again and maybe it will
maybe it will I kind of feel it I've
been calling for the gold age for a
while but we got kind of sidetracked by
that whole pandemic thing and then that
whole election that looked a little
weird so apparently the uh GOP
Republicans made big gains with
non-white
voters uh especially black male voters
so I share grow from uh 15 up to 15%
from 8% in 2020 according to AP
votecast uh but Trump had a huge jump
with Hispanics as
well he won 41% of the Hispanic vote he
set a record how do you
explain that that the mainstream media
has been non-stop trumps are racist
against brown people and he just won his
an historic
vote with the help of brown
people how exactly does that make
sense well maybe you should listen to
Scott because there's something I've
been telling you for a
while um one of my advantages of living
in California is I have pretty close
contact almost every day with um The
Immigrant Community from South of the
Border and what I could tell you that
pretty much everybody who has any
contact with that group can tell you
they're not only a terrific group of
people demographic wise you would love
to have them as your friends and
neighbors but uh they're very Republican
just by Nature they like the work they
like their families they like to follow
the
rules and they like their
gods God just one I guess and uh it
didn't surprise me to find out that the
Hispanic Community was way more likely
to support Trump than the media was
telling you should have been the
case and then I also imagin that uh at
least the men uh of all Races would see
through
this when what I say see through it I
mean the
media you know kind of a cover story for
everything the the fake the fake face
that the media puts on
everything and I believe that men have
an
interior uh biological
trigger that is not triggered by small
problems have you ever noticed that men
are not triggered by small
problems like maybe we don't tidy up
small
problem but when the big problems happen
your car is on fire and you're trapped
in it there is going to be a man in a
pickup truck who is going to stop and
he's going to reach his hairy arm into
your car unlock your seat belt and drag
you out at the risk of great personal
destruction because that's just how
we're
wired if it's important we show up if
it's not that important and you've got a
covered well you got it covered sort of
a male binary World by binary I mean is
this my problem if it's not my problem
it's not my problem if it is my problem
tell me who I have to
kill right I'm
speaking figuratively not actually
kill so here's what I think I think the
country as a whole saw that we were
heading toward a cliff the type that we
can't recover from and I think that when
men got triggered internally each person
individually I don't think it was any
one thing I don't think it was Trump I
don't think it was any one person I
think that men just one by one got
triggered and they said wait a
minute is everything going to fall apart
this isn't like regular times is
it th this is the time I have to show up
I for the first time in my life made a
conscious effort to get low propensity
people to vote in my personal Circle and
also on you know here on Liv stream I
was
successful so people did report back
that they voted and they would not have
otherwise voted so the low propensities
came through for
me and and even reported back now many
of you had the same situation both men
and women of course but I think men were
maybe the story here because I think
that they were triggered because this
look like an existential threat not just
another day of
politics and so the men Buck the women
in their own groups to some extent and
showed up now what I don't know
yet is if it was the Trump supporting
men who were lying to pollsters or if
they were just the hardest to reach bip
pollsters because they were less likely
to answer the phone or something I don't
know so we don't know exactly why the
polling didn't quite match the outcomes
uh I will note because I always mention
rasmason that rasmason had Trump
winning pretty handily and he won by
something pretty close to their
prediction and so
rasmason uh good for you congratulations
um and I say that because I I mention
their polls quite often so it's good to
know that they that that they got the
right answer that Trump would win and by
about the right
amount and here's what I look forward to
more than
anything I'm really looking forward to
the peaceful transfer of
power aren't
you because while Trump was teaching
half of the country how to Wi
the Democrats were teaching us how to
lose it seemed like every day they'd say
no no no in 2020 you didn't lose right
what you should have done is immediately
surrendered and just just rolled over
and uh quit you know and then and then
this is important after you lose then
you should never ever be in political
life
again now that's some good advice on how
to lose
and for four years now since January 6
2021 Democrats have been teaching us and
I I I appreciate their wise counsel how
to lose in the best possible way and now
and this is kind of Lucky
really since they've taught us how to
lose and how to peacefully trans for
power and how
to leave public life forever I'm looking
forward to uh their peaceful transfer of
power in fact it turns out that KLA
Harris in her role as vice president
will be the one to certify the landslide
election of
trump and uh that doesn't get any
[Laughter]
better apparently there was a rule
change that she has to certify she
doesn't have a choice like it's not
optional it's just now it's just
theatrical
so yeah we're going to see we're going
to find out um the best way to lose
taught to us by the people who've now
got got some good experience at
it um K Harris apparently gave a talk in
which she warned of Trump's fascism well
I don't think she learned
anything do you think the Democrats have
learned anything con Harris gives a
gives a ending
speech warning about Trump
fascism
um so here's what I
think I think we might be seeing the
total collapse of the Democrat
Party if you watched any of the uh the
fun of the let's say MSNBC or CNN
finding out that they' lost possibly
everything we don't know about the house
the house could still go to the
Republicans too and then that's a
different that's a different situation
and that could happen we don't know yet
but uh it was really obvious that the
Democrats didn't know why things went
wrong this
time and it was hilarious seeing all the
reasons but I'm going to talk about some
of the many reasons and I think maybe
it's just a whole bunch of little little
things but we'll
see
um but here's one of the things that I
don't think the Democrats saw
coming I think young people well here's
what I think I think that Trump very
smartly uh avoided the mainstream media
more than usual and went to the podcast
World which uh which the Democrats do
not have a hold on so the mainstream
programmed world is sort of a we think
probably a CIA manipulated Democrat
manipulated stuff so it's just nothing
but non-stop hoaxes but if you get to
the podcast I mean some of them have
some hoaxes too but but you're missing
the whole censorship you know
brainwashing regime and if it's true
that uh Trump just made a model of that
by using the podcast as really his
closing
argument I think that could destroy the
Democrats forever because their entire
their entire plan depends on being able
to brainwash the public with a Non-Stop
barrage of
 now I've got a little
whiteboard uh presentation for you
because you're going to need this so you
might want to clip this later I might
make a clip of
it but uh some of you are going to wake
up and find out that people in your life
let's say young people who are
supporting K Harris are going to
wonder um why did why did Hitler just
get
elected and you're going to have to
answer that question so rather than
answering it yourself I thought I would
do it for you and then you could just
show the video to the let's say the
young people in your family how how is
it that everybody everybody knew he was
Hiller everybody knew we all we all saw
it we saw him trying to steal democracy
with our own eyes and stuff so so how
could he possibly get elected I give you
the answer to
that and I'll give you the answer using
one
anecdote that can be
generalized and this is one I saw just
the other day um you you may know that
JD Vance in the closing days of the
campaign um was using some uh aggressive
hyperbole in a rally speech and he said
that the Republicans were going to take
out the trash and then he clarified the
trash is KL Harris now you could say to
yourself or even out loud well that's
not that's not nice don't call don't
call anybody trash but I would point out
that in the political context they're
calling each other fascists and Hitler
and stuff so they call each other stuff
and trash is not the worst thing and it
sounded like it was just a rhetorical
flourish because he was talking about
trash in the first place so he just
threw her in there now what you would
notice about this even if you don't like
that kind of discourse that he was
talking about exactly one
person he did not say anybody else was
trash he said one person and if you're
being reasonable about it when he said
trash he meant policies and performance
right I'm pretty sure if you held him
down and said do you mean that the human
being called KL Harris is not worth as
much as other human beings I'm pretty s
pretty sure he would say I'm not a mind
reader but I'm pretty sure JD Vance
would say something like no no
everybody's all people are have value
just the job she's doing is kind of
trash so we want to take out the trash
so that's what he really said in the
real world and then I turn to MSNBC and
I see one of their
actresses who couldn't possibly have any
other role except being an
actress um says he called women trash
but because that didn't happen and you
don't want somebody to go check that it
didn't happen they sell it with their
face and with their
attitude so this is Nicole Wallace
telling you what JD Vance
said
he
I he's he's calling all women
trash so of course that didn't happen if
it did happen that'd be that'd be
terrible I mean I wouldn't support that
at all but the people who watch M MSNBC
they don't really go check the original
Source they just believe that they're
watching real news and then that gets
into their empty heads which didn't have
anything else in it and then they think
that they know something now here's the
part that's hard to explain to the young
person this this is not a weird
situation that I had to look really hard
to
find this is all the news all the time
if you haven't yet learned that the news
is fake intentionally it's not
accidentally it's not making mistakes
MSNBC is intentionally a propaganda
Network that's primarily what it is now
you could say the same thing about Fox
News that the only thing I I defend
about Fox News is besides the fact that
they production is much better they have
much better producers and talent um that
they're transparent about it un at least
on Fox news people you know wink and
smile and you know they tell you that
they like President Trump and then the
news you know the Brett Bearer part is
is separate from
that but if you were watching
MSNBC and you had not been informed that
the news is not real and hasn't been
real for a long time maybe ever you
would think that you would learn
something because you turned on the news
but in fact all of the news is fake the
political news if you have a hurricane
the hurricane is probably true but the
political news it's all made up and it
has been for a very long time so the
reason that Hitler got
elected is that there was never a
Hiller it's the easy it's the easiest
explanation there was never a Hiller
that was purely something that somebody
was saying and it was just to win an
election and gain power and get your
money now who was it who figured out
that the messaging was fake well I don't
know if there's a male female difference
in how easily you can be Bamboozled by
 um there's probably no
difference it's probably not that but it
does seem to me that the regular news
the news that you sit down and you watch
while you eating your snack on the
couch young people are not watching that
so much nor are older people watching it
as much instead they're watching social
media and x and they're seeing what Elon
Musk is doing and they're seeing what
the podcasters are doing and what did
Joe Rogan say so suddenly that hold that
the media had where they could lie to
you over and over again it was just
non-stop hoaxes over and over it doesn't
have the same effect as it did even four
years ago just think of how the podcast
landscape has grown in four years now
because conservative voices didn't
really have this you know this home
where you could get the $5 million a
year paycheck just for being on TV they
had to create their own homes so they
created homes on Rumble you've got Dan
Bonino you've got you know pbd you've
got a whole bunch of uh whole bunch of
content that at least is friendly to the
right if not outright leaning to the
right so it could be that the Democrat
Party having such terrible policies in
my opinion they have policies that are
actually nonsense because they don't
take into account human behavior or
incentives or anything that none of that
could even get past the first gate if
they didn't have absolute total control
of the brainwashing mechanism of the the
news and now it appears
that they have less than full control of
that which means that the new
Battleground is the podcast space and if
Elon Musk had not rescued X I don't
believe any of this was possible I don't
believe the podcasters would be so
successful because X is partly how you
you know you promote
yourself and I don't think the Free
Speech would have gotten to the point
where people would have understood how
many hoaxes have been uh applied to them
but it it made me feel good to hear Elon
Musk talk about Non-Stop hoaxes and
using the word hoax because in the old
days you just say oh the other side is
saying things that aren't true and that
just feels like you know wind whistling
past you but if you say these are
non-stop
hoaxes that sort of gets your attention
what do you mean it's a hoax you have to
organize a hoax right the other stuff
could just be mistakes but a hoax is
is organized and these are all organized
hoaxes they're all organized so that's
new and only the podcast world and the
world on X and what I call the internet
dads they're not all dads some are Megan
Kelly and you know a number of other
superstars but it does seem like the
adult supervision let's call it that I
think the adult supervision returned in
the form of podcasts because they were
completely shut down of the you know the
normal fake news
world so
surprise um and I think it's hilarious
that MSNBC their their host they acted
like they couldn't tell why Harris
lost could they really not tell and they
couldn't tell that they were the
problem imagine if they ran a real
candidate and they just told the truth
you don't think you could beaten Trump I
mean Trump's a monster I mean he's he's
hard to beat but you don't think if You'
at least tried with a regular
politician somebody who had actual
skills and stuff like that I don't know
maybe that could have taken him
somewhere but instead they just prop up
the puppet they fill the world with
hoaxes and then they wonder why we
didn't fall for them it's because the
podcasters it's because of X it might be
because of uh Tik Tock which would be
funny
anyway it looks like uh Republicans
picked up the Senate as well so that
would be the presidency the
Senate the courts Supreme
Courts and
maybe maybe the house that's about as
hard as you can win Keith Orman of
course is claiming Russia stole the
election
again uh msnbc's host Joy Reed uh she's
blaming white women for missing a second
opportunity to address the
patriarchy at no time does Joy Reed say
hey maybe the problem is
Me Maybe if you keep calling somebody
Hitler and then he goes to the black
barber shop and works at McDonald's and
takes a bullet for you and you don't see
any Hitler stuff and he and he does the
first step thing for prisoners and he
does you know uh opportunity zones
whatever it is and black neighborhoods
and he funds the
HB the historically black colleges maybe
it's hard to keep the hoax
up maybe the hoax just couldn't couldn't
stand the the pressure of
facts but everybody's got an opinion um
I'm still waiting to find out if men
were the big
difference um some are saying that the
big difference is that women
underperformed as opposed to who men
showed
up
uh all
right just looking at one comment
there all right uh so here are some
other reasons that people
gave um there was some thought that uh
that men wouldn't vote for women
especially black men do you think that's
the reason that black man did not vote
for KLA Harris is that she's a
woman do you think that was the big
reason it's probably a little bit of a
reason you know maybe a little bit but
it can't be more than the number who
voted because she is a
woman well do do you think the number of
people who vote who wouldn't vote for
because she is a woman do you think that
number is bigger than the number who
voted for just because she is a woman
because I watched these three interviews
and when people in the street were asked
they quite often said because she's a
woman I don't know it seems like an
advantage to me so on MSNBC they're
still trying to sell you on the notion
that if you've got somebody who's
reached the level of Senator and vice
president and they're both a woman and a
person of color that that's all a
disadvantage in America in
2024 MSNBC trying to sell their final
hoax that it's a
disadvantage to be qu so qualified that
you've been an attorney general you've
been Senator you've been a vice
president I mean that's a lot of
qualifications and if you add on top of
that black and and female you telling me
that it shouldn't be a landslide in her
favor do you know if you if you had
replaced her with anybody capable it
would have been a landslide it really it
was her
capability in the
end um so it's the big games with the
non-white voters that's a big part of
the
story
um I saw some people suggesting that Tim
wals might have been dragging her down
uh Trey clav was it uh Travis Travis
what's his first name clay Travis was
asking if uh
if if wals was the worst VP pick ever
now I of course I like that framing
because it makes you think P the
sale but was he the worst
ever I'll tell you he was the worst ever
if you're trying to get
men the the videos of him
prancing it should have killed her for
everybody who had a penis it's like what
what the hell is going on there well not
everybody but you know at least the
heterosexual men who were looking at him
and again if he were just flat out gay I
don't think it would hurt him at all it
might have been a plus but if you prance
but you're acting like you're the manly
one and you're more manly than the other
side don't
prance and I have no problem with
prancing by the way I'm I'm Pro prancing
but just if that's who you are if if who
you are is a Prancer and if it's your
whole personality and your your sexual
preference great I like people are
authentic but he didn't come off his
authentic did he there was something
inauthentic about it and same with
Harris Harris seems terribly inauthentic
and I think that when we talk about
who's lying the
most um that's where things get
confusing because Trump is the most
authentic character we've ever seen he's
always the same no matter who he talks
to it's the same message um he doesn't
change he didn't he didn't modify too
much to run again you know maybe took a
little edge off or something no big
deal um oh let's see what I want to see
this comment no I can't
see so
anyway um I think that uh comml Harris
insulting citizens probably had
something to do with it inflation and
the price of groceries had something to
do with it
um there's a thought that Democrats were
ignoring some of the working Americans
especially the men that's definitely
part of it um they're also saying that
the Democrat strategy needs to be looked
at so all the smart Democrats are
looking at each other and saying um who
made the mistake
here who made the mistake and they're
all pretty sure it was somebody else
somebody else
but I think I think the I think the
story is
men because it's not just the story of
men who
were
voting but I think that uh I think
Trump's pyate ship um if you obviously
telsey Gabbert's an important part but I
think uh RFK Jr and
V and JD
Vance and Elon
um they they all have a very
male Vibe and I think the country was
just starving for it like the country
was starving for some kind of male
leadership now here's something that I
can say about men that I don't know
about women so might be the same with
women I don't know I just couldn't speak
to it but my take on men is that
men either need to be a leader or to
know who the leader
is and those are the two things that
make men comfortable if we don't know
who the leader is and we're not the
leader we're not really
comfortable and I don't know if that
works the same with women you it might
be a different situation but with Trump
especially when he assembled his pirate
ship you had male
leadership uh Elon I think certainly the
the tip of the spear but RF K Jr is very
manly for a Democrat right you know both
in his physique and in his attitude and
his just bravery so there was a whole
bunch of male leadership that was coming
from everything from Joe Rogan to other
podcasters to Mike cernovich to to me
and I think that a lot of
men responded to just leadership
and they said whatat are we supposed to
do and the the internet uh parents let's
say to keep it less uh less sexist um
said this time you need to vote but this
time voting isn't
enough when I saw that the here's the
first uh thing that I saw when I saw
that Republicans had suddenly switched
to become early
voters that's when the light went on
inside my head
because that wasn't just about early
voting being better than later voting it
was about the Republican base taking
direction that was the big thing the
thing was they responded to leadership
the leadership said you're in a big hole
I can get you out you got to vote but
that won't be enough you're going to
have to go find a low low propensity
voter and you're going to have to drag
him to the the voting booth I heard
countless stories of people who did
exactly that now how many of you were
directly or indirectly involved in
getting a low propensity voter to go
vote because that was a very
specific specific
direction from a group of uh leaders who
I think established their leadership and
a lot of that was Trump getting shot in
the air right again men respond to
bravery and real leadership and by the
time the the ear got shot and the pyate
ship formed and then Elon jumps on well
by that
time the the uh the leadership was
clear the The Men Who were there to
protect you and I think everybody who
voted for Trump believes he's there to
protect I think everything everybody
thinks the same of Elon except the left
of course of course but on the the
voting political right seeing Elon go
Allin was
phenomenal do you realize that Elon Elon
bet everything on this he bet everything
his businesses I think would have been
dismantled and he could have ended up in
jail if if things had going the other
way that was one of the bravest things
you're ever going to see you think Trump
is Brave he made everybody
braver he made everybody braver he made
it okay to say all right I'm going to
vote for
jump he made that by his own bravery and
and that level of bravery just makes
other men say oh I got to I got to
lift my game a little bit so I'm going
to be a little braver too and no one was
braver than musk and he's certainly got
a he's got a a history of being the
bravest guy in the game over and over
again
U here's what Tucker asked Elon I think
it was last night so how much pressure
has there been on youah shut down
X and Elon said well apart from multiple
Democrats saying they want to put me in
jail take away government contracts for
my companies nationalize my companies
Deport me as an illegal and have me
arrested for apparently being Putin's
best friend nothing besides those
things and
I would like to say that uh the other
thing that Elon did that I think David
saxs did um and uh chamoth did on the
all-in Pod and I think some of the other
uh Silicon
Valley you know notables and something
that I think I
did and I think cernovich
did which is we made it safe for smart
people to support Trump
that was that was the risk that I took
so the the risk that I took for the
country because there really wasn't much
in it for
me is I would make it
safe and after nine years of
work it's
safe you can all come out
now well what uh one of my favorite
videos coming out of the aftermath was
uh Eric ab abonati was pointing it out
on X that Jake Tapper was being shown a
map of the country and it was going to
show all the counties where Harris did
better than Joe Biden or at least as
well as Joe Biden and he calls up the
map and it's dark
gray in other words there was not
one not one County in the entire United
States
stes uh in which she outperformed Joe
Biden Jake Tapper quote holy smokes
literally nothing literally not one
County yes literally not one
County now do you believe that Joe Biden
got all those votes if K Harris couldn't
beat him in even one County just one
County not one
now the other question I have is there
must not have been a big problem with
cheating or
illegal illegal aliens voting or even
overseas
voting I suspect the Watchers were
watching too well so that maybe nobody
could get away with it I think the
watching is the big story here we'll
never really know but uh I'm willing to
revise my
opinions uh about how cheating may have
happened in the fast if there's new
information I'll take it but we'll see
um I'm not entirely sure that we're
done because it seems to me things are
too quiet and it seems like the
Democrats are not making enough of a
complaint as if they have a
plan as if the real plan was Trump's
going to win the election and then so
the thing I'm worried about is the and
then which could be be any form of
lawfare who knows now in theory all the
smart people are saying that Trump's
legal problems will either go away or be
postponed into The Nether
world I'm not so
sure because
remember some of them still think
they're trying to stop Hitler and save
their own jobs and their own lives and
everything else so if you're telling me
that it's it's not typical to continue
with the lawfare while the while the
president is a city president um then I
would say to
[Music]
you maybe things won't be typical this
time so I think Trump is still in Mortal
danger both physically definitely
physically but at least uh at least JD
Vance is there as his you know backup
protection and that should make a big
difference by the
way so I think there's going to be more
Shenanigans I don't think I don't think
it's a clean path to the uh smooth
transfer of power I think there will be
some legal Shenanigans probably it
matters who wins the house if
Republicans win the house then I think
everything's going to be fine if they
don't it's still going to be a
fight
anyway
um one of the things Michael
shellenberger points out and he said uh
this morning our intelligence Community
is is rotten to the core serious
investigations are required we need to
get to the bottom of the censorship
January 6 Co origins lawfare
weaponization of CIA FBI and DHS we need
a church committee 2.0 the people must
regain control of our government I would
uh I would agree with
that at the very least we need to regain
confidence so you know maybe all of
these entities are thoroughly corrupt
maybe just a little bit at the top but
whatever the situation
is uh I'd sure like to
know RCP house is one so so somebody's
saying the house is
one so I think that's a projection not
yet a done deal I think it's projected
that the Republicans will
win that would be amazing
um that would be amazing in other news
the hooes have declared a
ceasefire so let's connect the
dots Trump gets
elected and then suddenly the
Unstoppable
hoodies just decided to stop and the
reason was oh it was always a defensive
War
that's what the Udi said the Udi said no
it was always just a defensive War so
now we're we're done with it so we're
all good we're all
good we're we're all good we're just
kidding yeah we're done no we're done
stop sees no no
fair um do you think that's a
coincidence do you think that's a
coincidence cuz I don't cuz if there was
one thing that thought that Trump could
stop sort of right away it was the
hoodies I think the hoodies thought he
could stop her right away too because
there's there is some siiz mother of all
bombs that can make that problem end
really fast it just has to be a big
enough bomb and we we know that Trump
will at least threaten him with a big
enough bomb he's going to say here's
your Capital here's my bomb what do you
want to do well you know a ceasefire how
about a ceasefire excellent idea
that's an excellent
idea
so um there's some news about process
food being bad for you but that doesn't
feel like the right message for today so
ladies and
gentlemen I would like to take a few
minutes just to
enjoy um on X with
you let's see if we can make this work
it'll be
amazing this is H bat Walsh asked
for
um he asked for the people see make this
presentation there it is these are all
the people who are having a hard
time let's find a good one
I can't figure out how to make the sound
work on
this too complicated come on sound now
has a direct could potentially have a
direct line to the Oval Office I think
this is a big huge huge part of the
story that it's hard to even digest
fully at this moment but you have Elon
Musk who owns Twitter X whatever we're
calling it these days X who is a dis all
right all right well we don't have any
good ones here oh there's a good
one all right we'll just leave that one
up for a
minute well it seems to me that the
Democrats have practiced losing to Trump
and they definitely did not have the
same kind of reaction that they had
before I wonder if they expected it on
some
level um but we'll watch today to see
how crazy people
get um let's keep an eye on the story of
whether or not there were 15 or 20
million more uh votes for Biden than
they were mirages I really really would
love to you know to find out that 2020
was was
BS that would be
fun all right does anybody want to have
a in your comments is there anything you
want to enjoy
saying Candace Owen says I've never
wanted to watch The View more than today
same I definitely want to watch The View
today oh and
uh Mark Cuban did a uh very professional
and um appreciated congratulations to
Trump for winning the election and I
appreciate um you know I appreciate him
I I like that it was a you know good
fair
fight good contest and uh there were
smart people on both sides trying really
hard and that makes a big
difference unburdened by what is
Biden yeah was
classy all right he said fair and square
huh good that's good for him to say that
how would anybody know if an election
was fair on the night of it the night it
happens except it's not a fair
fight buy coffee for this car behind you
at Starbucks
maybe yeah you
know I think we do have some
responsibility to uh you know not dance
too hard on the graves of the losers
today um we can enjoy it I do think the
golden age has been
Unleashed
um I have to I have to say there's just
this weird feeling to it for me um I
wasn't expecting to know how to
feel I think I was happier for Scott
Pressler than just about anything else I
I love to see somebody put their heart
and soul into something you know like
trying to save the country which is what
Scott presler was doing and then of
course he had lots of help you know with
Elon and uh you know just lots of help
but he was such a
star like he always he always made you
feel like as long as he was working in
Pennsylvania it always seemed like Trump
could
win but I don't think you can
underestimate how important that was
just your how you generally felt going
into it it's like ah I think Scott
pressler's got you know Pennsylvania
wrapped up nice and looks like he did
one hell of a job Scott Pressler that
one's for the ages you will forever be
remembered it's for the ages
all right
accountability well we'll see it's too
early to talk about
that Charlie
Kirk yeah Charlie Kirk did a lot of
great
work all right what
else uh mentorships for young black
men that would be useful
although I think AI can get you there
almost the mentorship stuff maybe some
combination of humans and
AI it's God God's mercies on us
okay who are my friends in high
places I got lots of friends in high
places I should interview him well maybe
if I do
interviews the Lector and guy who wants
to take a capital tour with me on
Election Day I know my way
around you know the the other thing that
uh always made me feel confident I just
saw a comment that I'm going to copy
from uh from locals that uh if if you've
watched Laura Trump any of her videos on
say
Instagram in which she shows her workout
it's it's like the the most aggressive
female workout you'll ever see and she's
in such good shape and she seems like
such a predator personality and I say
that in a good way um knowing that she
was putting together an army with Watley
of course not by herself um that made me
feel very comfortable because you can't
really look at Lara Trump and say
there's somebody who's not going to try
hard right you take one look at her you
go okay whatever you're doing is going
to be you know you're going to take it
to the nth degree and it looks like she
did so sometimes you can judge people's
personality by their
physique and and I think her physique
screamed you can't stop
me and like you could just hear that
loud and clear okay you can't stop me
what was that a brick wall all right
we'll take care of that brick
wall you know I just want to spend my
time with you and bask in this forever
but I know you have other things to do
so I'm going to say uh some words to the
locals subscribers privately thanks for
joining you've got a lot of people to
watch on TV and watch them meltdown so
you can enjoy it um I'm going to go talk
to the locals people privately
now all right we got 30 seconds to
