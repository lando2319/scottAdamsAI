hey everybody
got in come on in there's time
still time to get a good seat up front
for
a smoky because it's very smoky here in
california
coffee wiscons i'm still alive
because i'm not going outdoors i don't
know how long i could survive outdoors
i've decided that california now has
three seasons
you got your sunny season your rainy
season and your smoky season
because this uh everything being on fire
seems to be now an annual thing so i
think that's that's the way it's going
to go
anyway i know what you're here for
you're here for the simultaneous step
and all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tankard
jealous or stein a canteen jogger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better eventually it's called
the simultaneous sip and it happens
now
delightful so
um it's september 11th
as you know and
you know how sometimes bad news
turns into accidental good news you know
the bad part is still there but
there's something good that comes out of
it and vice versa
you you know we you never know what kind
of
unintended consequences anything has
as horrible as 9 11 was
you know we're all on the same page on
that as horrible as 9 11 was
think about how important it is today
like literally today think about
what the united states is going through
as it
approaches the election we are in
full out divisive mode
and we're running at 100 miles an hour
divisive divisive devices you know it's
like it's like
two uh muscle cars doing a drag race
it's like
it's just two cars and they're going 100
miles an hour
bam it's 9 11.
9 11 hits and all of your
 looks like
now tomorrow we'll go back to fighting
tomorrow we'll be divided along racial
lines we'll be
divided along economic lines we'll be
divided along
gender lines you know as we as we like
to be
but today not today
nope not today
so think about the fact that just by
historical coincidence it didn't have to
happen this way
this september september 11th
every four years will just be that
little pause
that reminds us oh wait a minute
wait a minute we're all on the same side
and you just need to remember that every
now and then
so i'm just glad that september 11th
happens in september
because it's exactly the time
that this country will need every four
years
you know obviously would be reminded
every year but every fourth year
it takes on a completely different
meaning and i've never
i've never really felt that until this
this election
this being so divisive but um
let's be thankful that september 11th
happened in september
it doesn't make any of those lives come
back doesn't make it any
less of a tragedy but if there's one
thing that this country does well
it's capitalizing on a crisis we're
really good at that
and if we can find some value out of
charred embers i mean literally we can
say oh
here's some charcoal i'll make a
barbecue and
you know maybe we can maybe we can dig
down some value of this
this september 11th uh eventually
now um
i was wondering what joe biden's
morning looks like on a day like today
and so i was just trying to picture it
like the movie in my head of
he wakes up and at some point
probably there's an advisor there pretty
quickly i'd imagine
he's probably swarmed with advisors
and he probably says some version of so
what's the news
what's what's happening today i'm just
imagining this visor saying well
um so today's not ideal
because it's september 11th so all day
today
you can't be a dick you just you're just
gonna have to take a day off from being
a dick
and today would be a bad day to
let's say promote your race hoaxes that
are the basis of your campaign
because that's a little divisive and
just not today
it's september 11th so joe says all
right all right well
i guess i won't be making news and he
literally said that this morning to the
news crew
he said i won't be making news today
because he just wanted to
treat things seriously because it's
september 11th
not not a bad approach you know good
role model kind of a thing
uh but you know there might be a few
other news things that
pop up and you could see him saying to
his advisors
all right so it's september 11th what
else anything else happened today
yeah yeah a couple other things happened
today
number one remember how you thought it
was a fluke
when you saw that first poll that showed
that
african-american support for trump was
at record levels
and you knew that couldn't be true right
and remember how the second time you saw
a poll that
said the same thing you said to yourself
well
you know that's just two that can't
really be real can it
well rasmussen will have some numbers
coming out today from
north carolina and uh you might see
you might see that there's an actual
trend here it turns out
that this president probably will break
a record
for black support did you see that
coming
now when i say break a record for black
support i mean of rep
republicans republican presidents right
obviously not for democrats but
how many of you would have predicted how
many of your filters would have
predicted
in 2015 or 16 that
trump would be legendary
like not just do okay but break records
for black support how many of you had a
filter on life
that predicted that was likely i did
because i predicted it directly publicly
many times i said this president's gonna
break records for black support
here we are and then joe biden says to
his advisor in the morning
after he gets his coffee oh that's not
good i
it's 9 11 so i can't use my race hoaxes
today
so i'm kind of unarmed and now you're
telling me that
uh i the main reason that i even got
nominated is
because i would have black support and
you're telling me that trump will have
more black support than any republican
president
maybe ever except you know maybe lincoln
or something
and then the advisor says
oh ah there's just one more thing
just one more thing it's not a big deal
but
election is coming up and your
competitor
uh president trump he just got nominated
for um i don't know how to say this
ah a second
nobel peace prize uh
for his kosovo serbia agreement
and and helping that get done so
you're running against a guy who will
have the highest
african-american support of any
republican president
who just got nominated for
two
two nobel peace prizes
now you say to yourself ah anybody can
get nominated
being nominated doesn't mean you won
but if you look at the details
of why he got nominated they're pretty
solid
nobody made anything up nobody's fact
checking it nobody said hey
there's no kosovo serbia agreement
nobody's saying that nobody's saying
what uae israel deal that doesn't exist
even the fake news doesn't say that
apparently
president trump has earned
two he's earned
two nobel peace prize nominations
but i think if you look at the details
whether or not he gets you know the
actual prize he earned the prizes
he earned two nobel peace prizes
and joe biden has to wake up in the
morning and say well what am i running
against
oh are you kidding me
so in the history of presidents nobody
has ever run against somebody
who had just got nominated for did i
mention
two nobel peace prizes
[Laughter]
now what i've been telling you that i
think the president's gonna win in a
landslide
but even i didn't think it was gonna be
this bad
and so if you take into account that
he's starting to
depending on what polls you're looking
at he's drawing even or pulling ahead in
the battleground states
biden continues to just decompose
and uh cnn had lots of good things to
say about
kamala harris because you know kamala
harris is considered
not just the vice presidential candidate
but because it's biden people think of
her as almost a shadow president
situation
you know maybe she'll be the real power
right away or soon or something
and so you'd expect that the people
promoting her would
have some good things to say about her
about her policies and
her accomplishments and stuff like that
so let me check the news
let's see what cnn is saying about karma
harris there's probably lots of news
about her accomplishments i'm thinking
if not her accomplishments then
certainly there's going to be lots of
news about the policies that she
promotes
checking here it is there's a story
about kabul harris
on the front page of cnn clicking that
people are talking about her footwear
uh in her skinny jeans apparently
there's quite a bit of excitement
because she wears a particular kind of
footwear
sort of a sneaker-ish situation
but there's probably that's just the
lead-in obviously there's stuff here
about her accomplishments and her
policies looking looking now it's still
about her footwear
nope that's all we got that's all we got
so i don't know if i mentioned yet but
president trump was nominated for
two two nobel
peace prizes which he's earned both of
them
but he's got some strong competition
because on the other side
there's somebody who's wearing sneakers
who lots of people think is a good
fashion statement
so that should be close
i would like to give you my impression
of every democrat that i've been
debating online and
they they seem to be able to win
arguments by
facial expressions and not arguing
and i'd like to give you my impression
of dale
representing every democrat that i've
debated with this week
and it goes like this i'll first start
in my character
played by myself you know
mathematicians say that two plus two
equals four and then
dale the democrat will come in to
fact-check me
and he'll fact-check me this way
why don't they just call you dilbert's
boss
did you see what i did there oh yeah
show me your sources what sources
what college did you go to
look at this guy two plus two equals
four
[Applause]
idiot idiot uh this is why you support
trump
you're just thinking two plus two equals
four
[Laughter]
oh idiots idiots
i i gotta say i thought somebody else
was the dumbest person
in the world but now that i see you with
your two plus two stuff
i'm like well now you're the dumbest
person in the world
obviously
scene
so yeah the the wide-eyed tell did you
see the interview
uh with with uh i guess
the major one of the major advisors for
joe biden
on his campaign his name is duck low
spelled just like a duck d-u-c-k-l-o
that's his last name duck low so
joe biden who literally was in a
basement below the ground
ducking questions his main advisor is
duck low
i think the simulation is talking to us
maybe we can figure out what it means
but the funny part was that
i guess was bret bear who asked him
directly
did um did biden agree with the travel
ban
from china and ducklow he gets the
wide-eyed look
now if i've told you nothing democrats
all lie
with a the similar liar face
it's where their eyes get really big
to try to convince you of something that
didn't happen
and so ducklow gets the big eyes and he
says
there is plenty of fact-checking bret
bear
i could give it to i mean i could send
you the fact-checking
that said that joe biden did not
disagree
with the travel ban and then bret bear
says
just clarifying so you're saying that
joe biden agreed with the travel ban
when president trump suggests it you're
saying he agreed with it
i'm saying i can send you all the fact
checking it's been debunked and debunked
and fact-checked and it
everybody knows that joe biden did not
disagree with it
bret baer says okay just clarifying
you haven't quite answered the question
you've ducked low
no bret bear didn't say that but i wish
he had
duck low but that's not exactly
the answer to the question so i'll ask
again
are you saying that joe biden agreed
with president trump
well he didn't get an answer to that
as you might expect but he did give
very big eyes like that
if you were listening to this on audio
only you're missing my tremendous
impressions
in which i make big bug eyes and
well you're just missing the best part
uh
police departments are trying to dispel
the rumors that antifa
starring the wild wildfires in the west
coast
and i guess they're they're starting i
guess antifa
is very particular because wildfires
don't destroy
many black businesses so i think antifa
is more concentrated on burning up black
businesses and urban centers
they don't say it that way but that's
how it turns out
they burned other businesses too just to
be fair to be fair they do burn other
people's businesses
so in that way you could say they are
pursuing equality in a way
um we'll talk a little more about
antifungal moment
so india this was reported on cnn's
website
the india may have a lot of problems
with their reporting
apparently in india most people die at
home
or somewhere that's not a hospital so
india has a real trouble
uh counting the number of coronavirus
related deaths
because so many people just die at home
or not under medical care
but here was a interesting statement
again it's important that this was on a
cnn website
and it says and i quote with more tests
authorities are detecting more cases
what
what this is cnn is stating
that in india if you test more
you'll detect more virus
because i'm sure that i have been mocked
for suggesting that the president may
have made sense
when he said that the more you test the
more virus you will detect
because that's why you test to detect
virus
and all the smart people told me that
didn't make sense may i do an impression
of every smart person who's telling me
why it's so dumb to think
that if you test more you will detect
more
oh look at this guy why don't you stay
in your lane
uh pointing here boss much
so that was the intellectual debate i've
been getting on the question of
does testing find more cases
um
so did you watch the uh the first
nfl game last night did anybody watch
that
if you saw the stands i don't know what
um
i don't know what kind of rules they
have about
in person but the stands were largely
empty
there were people there but there were
lots of i don't know if that was just
the social distancing rules
or just not a people a lot of people
went or what
but it wasn't well attended and yet
when when the players locked arms to
support um their social positions
there was a lot of bowing a lot of
bowing
for the fact that there weren't many
people there
it was a lot of bowing for not many
people in attendance
making me think that there were more
bows than there were supporters
now my take on it is that sports are not
terribly important just in general
i wouldn't care if all professional
sports ended tomorrow
just wouldn't care i stopped watching
professional sports a while ago
but the real question is whether
you need to mix your social messaging in
every product or can you
separate your social messaging from your
product
if if the sports game is the product
doesn't make sense to always mix those
so
without without debating whether it's
good to
talk about equality of course it is you
know without debating whether it's good
to
always strive for a more equal society
of course it is
so the message you know the the idea
behind it of course is fine
everybody i think everybody agrees with
it on in concept
but do you need to put it in your sports
does it have to be everywhere and i saw
the most
scathing that's right the deepest
cutting criticism of the nfl that i've
ever seen
are you ready for this i don't believe
anybody's ever said anything
worse about the nfl than what i'm gonna
and i didn't write down who said it but
it was a twitter
user and said that uh you know the
uh this uh why can i never remember all
the
the victims names i think i'm supposed
to remember all the victims
but the the gentleman who got shot seven
times but survived
and he was alleged to have been a sexual
assaulter
and somebody content somebody on
twitter commented that there's a real
woman in the united states
a living real woman not a conceptual
woman
not in principle somebody might exist
that
but an actual woman with a name and a
life
who someday will turn on tv and see the
name of her rapist
on the on the written on the helmets of
the football players
imagine that imagine
that you were literally a victim of a
sex crime
and you have to watch the nfl all these
multimillionaires write the name of your
attacker
allegedly on on their helmet and then
play a game in front of the whole
country
think about that that's actually the the
most cutting criticism
i think i've ever heard maybe the worst
criticism i've ever heard of any
professional
league for doing anything not even on
this topic you could say any topic
putting putting that guy's name on their
helmets
i would say you'd have to nominate that
for one of the worst
things anybody's ever done
not just in sports but if you if you
if you if you don't count you know
actual physical violence to stuff
you know that's bad that's the worst
stuff but of things that are not
physically violent but are
let's say socially or psychologically
devastating just imagine
that you were a victim of a crime and
you see the vic
the perpetrator's name according to you
on the helmets of the nfl
if you ever watch another nfl game i
don't know why you would
really i just don't know why you would
because
they've completely thrown you know women
and me too under the bus
and i don't think they could be
further from social justice warriors
which is what they'd like to be they'd
like to be
you know if i could use that term they'd
like to be on the right side of history
they'd like to be on the right side of
justice but boy did they miss it
you know that i think the players
intentions are great
i wouldn't i don't even you know i don't
fault any of the players for doing what
they need to do
freedom of speech blah blah blah but man
did they miss their sh
they missed the target by a mile there
there's
another story in the news that is so
mind-boggling that you can't actually
hold it in your mind for
long in other words there's something
that if you could accept that it's true
and it is true there's no
there's no argument about whether it's
true if you can accept that it's true
you just can't process it in your brain
to do something about it
and here's the story that apparently
several dozen phones
associated with the mueller
investigation were
accidentally wiped of all their data
so that when the uh the uh who was it
the department the inspector general
wanted to review them
that they were not available and the
excuses they gave were
physical damage in a few cases but that
they'd forgotten
their own passwords and they tried their
password too many times and it deleted
their phone
now have you ever tried entering the
wrong password in your phone
it makes you wait to do it again if you
do it too many times
you'd have to really work hard to delete
your data
like it would have to be a project where
you'd come back to it every several
hours
say all right put in one more password
timeout i'll come back to this hours
later now
i don't think there's anybody dumb
enough to think that these are real
accidents
and these are obviously excuses they're
transparent excuses for people who wiped
the data that could have been relevant
to the inspector general now that is so
mind-bogglingly big
that nothing will happen do you get that
the the idea of it you almost can't hold
it in your brain
like i i can't conceive that that there
were
dozens several dozen several
dozen phones people deleted evidence
and these were people working in a legal
field for the united states
and they were they were looking for
crimes of exactly this nature
they were looking for this kind of crime
obstruction of justice now
i don't know how you could see it any
other way but
destroying evidence that they knew could
be later discoverable
because it might be relevant feels to me
exactly like obstruction of justice and
not a little bit
i'm talking about coordinated because
obviously
there must have been some coordination
i'm talking about massive
obvious direct you almost can't hold it
in your mind
and because and i mean this literally
that you can't
hold it as true because it's just too
ridiculous
too ridiculous and because your brain
can't quite process it
i think they actually will just get away
with it
it's kind of a weird situation that is
so unusual you just can't really process
it
that's what i think all right i
drew out a bunch of
a bunch of trolls as i like to do
they were all confused about what i was
saying and what i was doing
but i i made a tweet that i said that uh
you know
antifa i'll paraphrase my own tweet the
antiphon would be
surprised to learn that the original
antifa fought on the same side with
uh hitler against the weimar republic
and um now
i can tell you because you're you're my
insiders
so let me tell you what i was thinking
and why i sent that tweet
number one do i think it's relevant that
a german organization in the 30s
had the same name as you know
at least translated it's the same name
as antifa
in portland in 2020. do i think that
that matters
no no oh i don't think that matters
it has nothing to do with anything i
also don't think it matters
that uh the kkk used to be
you know more of a democrat kind of a
thing
because if it's not relevant to 2020 i
don't care
it's just history it's not a history
that matters it's just a fact
that doesn't matter you know because all
that matters is today
and so the the first
tongue-in-cheek that people should have
known it should have been a red flag
how serious i was about this the first
flag should have been
is he serious that this unrelated group
because there's no connection through
time they're unrelated
and i guess it was a swedish group there
was also some kind of anti-fog
that was separate from both germany
separate from the current one
separate one separate from the modern
version of antifa in europe
so i think there are at least four
versions of antifa
i guess the u.s one has some connection
to europe
but no i was not serious
not even a little bit serious that
there's that it matters
what antifa in germany and 1930s did
i don't think it matters it's just a
different group different circumstance
but i knew it would bring out the trolls
and here's the
here's the next part
um just to be provocative i said that
antifa in germany in the 30s was allied
with hitler
now is that an over claim i
i gave people the link on
wikipedia and it will tell you that
the german antifa and hitler's group
fought each other which is not like
allies right that would be the opposite
because they were fighting each other
but at the same time they were both
fighting the common government
that they both wanted to overthrow now
the government was overthrown hitler
came to power
and the first one of the first things he
did was get rid of antifa
because they were they were useful
fighting the government but as soon as
hitler was in power they were no longer
useful and
so he dealt with them harshly so the
historians are coming after me and
saying
god scott scott you idiot you've pointy
haired idiot
read some history where are you making
up these stories about antifa
being allied with the nazis and then i
do then i do this are you waiting for
the second part
i say well i get why you might not like
that word
allied but they were fighting on the
same side
meaning that they were both opposed to
the government we'd agree on that
the historians will agree on that we
also agree that they
you know fought each other a little bit
doesn't take
doesn't remove from the fact that they
had a common enemy
but here's the thing it's a lot like
20 20 antifa and black lives matter
here's why it's similar have you seen
antifa
and black lives matter get into any
scuffles
i think you have i think you have
now they've been minor and and primarily
blm and antifa are opposed to the
the current government current you know
systems i guess but what would happen
if they prevailed suppose
suppose antifa and black lives matter
overthrew the government i don't think
it's going to happen
but imagine they did just like antifa
and hitler
overthrew the german government what
would happen if black lives matter and
antifa somehow came to power
would they say i'm glad we're all on the
same side
let's form a government let's part
antifa and part black lives matter
no antifa is against governments
no antifa are anarchists they don't want
to be part of a government
black lives matter they're you know
they're marxist etc
but even they like a bernie sanders kind
of
capitalism with a lot of socialism
overlaid
but they still want a capitalist system
i think most of them do
you know maybe some of the leaders are
radical but most of black lives matter
you know rank and file kind of people
they're not looking to get rid of bernie
sanders socialism
they kind of like it antifa
they can't live with any kind of
capitalism
even a bernie sanders capitalism is way
too much
so black lives matter and antifa are
allied
only because they have a common enemy
but they are not on the same team and
if they ever came to power they would
have to fight
who would win well i'd bet on black
lives matter
frankly in part because do you know who
would be on the same side as black lives
matter if they ever
decided to turn on antifa
republicans
republicans black lives matter would
have plenty of allies
because the people who want capitalism
now of course all of this is silly and
it will never happen but what i wanted
to do
was to get people to think through the
analogy
and just make them uncomfortable about
the current situation
because of how they feel about the the
other one now here was the other thing
that i learned while looking into this
apparently anti-fa in germany the
original
1930s version when they used the word
fascist all it meant was capitalism
that's it it didn't matter if you had
you know classical classic fascist
elements
if you were capitalist but it's just
fascist by definition
so when the antifa people say to me
i have to get my dale beard again to say
this as they do
often ah scott
uh anti-fascist
the it's in the name uh how could you be
confused
it's in the name did i mention it's in
the name
anti means opposed are you following me
so far
anti means opposed to second word
fascist fascist opposed
to fascist therefore antifa
is opposed to fascists scott do you not
understand
am i talking too fast do you not
following this yet
to which i say what does it mean in
germany
didn't mean that so
it is obvious from the original antifa
that the word fascist
sort of means just anybody who's making
money
basically capitalism if you're making
money
in any way you're a fascist
so uh all i wanted to get out of this
was to sort of stir the
the thinking pot and just make people
uncomfortable
and maybe they would shift in their
opinions over time
so it's just a little context that i
thought was fun um i'm being
accused of being the dumbest guy in the
world
in the world uh for for that tweet
but people don't realize that it was
more mischievous than historical
all right um
so lindsay uh lindsey graham says
there's a big surprise coming in 10 to
12 days
about the about the situation with
russia collusion and the investigation
about how that went down
so something big coming in 10 to 12 days
now i don't know if it'll be 10 to 12
days but the fact that
the fact that the durham investigation
looks like it might wrap up before the
election
that is an interesting coincidence
in france the hospitalization rates are
up for coronavirus covet 19
and i use this as further evidence
that leadership is an illusion or at
least
leadership as a major variable
and how people are doing with
coronavirus is probably just an illusion
and the illusion goes like this if
you're democrats and you're not good at
analyzing stuff president trump
didn't do enough testing okay
what was he supposed to test with was
the president supposed to do
lots of testing with the test kits that
didn't exist
and that even the people who were
responsible for the test kits
didn't know they didn't exist because
they had test kits they just didn't know
they were defective
so was the president supposed to
magically make
test kits or magically know they needed
to be made
when the experts themselves didn't know
that
and where were all the test kits from
the obama administration that he could
just use
what about all that time he lost in
preparation where he could have been
getting
ppe ready wait a minute why would the
pres why would trump
have to have to need time to
to get a bunch of ppe when
obama had a gigantic storehouse of it
just in case
oh oh did i get that wrong wait are you
telling me that obama
and biden when they were in office they
didn't have a gigantic
national supply of ppe i don't know why
they didn't have that
since they knew this pandemic was coming
and they knew they would need it
can you explain to me why they were so
aware of it coming
and yet we did not have warehouses full
of ppe
to be to be ready huh so
it's only people who are and then the
third point there
is that testing and contact tracing
only works if you have a small group of
infections and maybe a
an island situation or a small country
if you get it early
maybe maybe you can tamp it down but
if you're the united states and people
are driving in and walking in
and flying in from every direction and
you're one of the main destinations on
planet earth
and it's just impossible to stop it all
i mean no even if you stop travel from
china
still people walking across the border
still coming in from canada who
came from china so the united states
never really had the option in a
realistic way
of of doing contact tracing and stopping
it while it was small
you can fantasize that that was possible
but it wasn't it wasn't was it possible
in new zealand
i think so i think it was if president
trump
had been the leader of new zealand could
he have
done the same thing that the leader of
new zealand did which seems to be
effective
probably do you think the leader of new
zealand
just made her own decisions or or
do you think she talked to her experts
and the experts said
well we're a small country don't have
many infections
i think we can test our way through this
because we do have enough tests to do
that
and then she said well i don't have a
better idea
well i'm not the expert if that's what
you say will work
let's do that now replace her with
president trump
experts come and they say we've got
enough test kits we're a small country
we can test
let's do it does trump does president
trump then say
ah no i don't think so
no no he says the same thing that the
leader of
new zealand said yeah let's do that
you're the experts
let's do that so if you
are unsophisticated and you don't have
much experience in life
or you've never read the dilbert comic
strip you might still be suffering the
illusion
that leadership is a big variable in how
things turn out
it really isn't because most of life
in big organizations is people at lower
levels
surfacing their expertise and then the
leader says yes or no
but it's not really the leader deciding
because it's very rare for the leader to
say well there's your expert opinion
i'm going to go a different direction
because if you make a mistake that way
you're done right so as long as
everybody's following directions from
the experts and the experts
largely were in agreement around the
world wasn't a lot of it's not like
there was one country
where all the experts were on a
different page that didn't happen
so we should see that the most
the most predictable thing that you
could see is that hypothetically
if you could just switch all the leaders
you know just snap your fingers and all
the leaders go into different countries
and they're just as smart just as
capable
as before but now magically they know
the language and the culture and stuff
so you just replace the leaders how do
how do those
countries turn out in terms of
coronavirus
exactly the same exactly the same
so the big illusion that the fake news
and the people who don't have experience
in big companies are selling you
is that the leadership is the big
variable
and and then you know they all have a
menu of tools
so it's it's how you decided to use
those tools
your leadership that is the big
you know the differentiator between who
gets a good result who gets
a bad result nothing like that's
happening
that is just an illusion they were all
just following expert advice
experts largely gave the same advice
some countries faster some slower
some had hydroxychloroquine supplies
some didn't so some had options that
others didn't
but it's not leadership that you're
seeing here that's that's not the main
filter all right um
i'm not in favor of raising taxes just
in general
you know if there's any way you cannot
raise taxes
you should do it but let's say
you wanted to mess with bernie sanders
and let's say you wanted to um
what's the word uh where you co-opt or
you somehow take somebody else's policy
there's a better word for that suppose
president trump this is not going to
happen
this is purely a thought experiment so
don't get hung up on
that'll never happen because i'm telling
you this will never happen
but it's a good thought experiment it
goes like this tax
the um the monopoly digital companies
you know your facebooks your googles you
can throw a few more names in there
amazon maybe and you tax them
specifically to pay for health care
and free college for anybody who doesn't
have it yet
so i'm not talking about paying for
health care for the whole country
i'm talking about they would cover the
gap for those people who can't get
health care
they would cover the gap for anybody who
wanted to go to college but couldn't
afford it that sort of thing
and here's here's the beauty of the idea
it would basically be a syntax because
social media
is sort of like liquor and cigarettes in
the sense that it's not good for you
you know it's not good for you but it's
a free country so we're not going to get
rid of it
and because it's not healthy in a
variety of different ways
it does make sense that you tax the
things that are least healthy
and then you use that money we have a
tradition for this cigarette taxes for
example
then you use that syn tax money to do
something that's very healthy for the
public
what would be healthier for the public
than getting everybody good health care
nothing what would be healthier for the
public
than making sure they could get good
educations
nothing i mean it's probably one of the
best things you can do for your health
is to have an education and therefore a
good chance of
for a good economic situation and
there's a big difference
you know the richer you are the better
your health it's pretty direct
so uh in a practical sense nothing like
that would happen but here's the
here's the uh the interesting part of
the idea if the big digital companies
realized that only they were being taxed
for this very special kind of tax for
health care and for
uh for education now it doesn't have to
be college education it could also be
maybe school choice etc
what would they do well the first thing
they do is they'd say
wait a minute i'm paying a billion
dollars a year for these things
or however many billions but
if i can make the cost of providing
health care go down
so too would my taxes if i could make
the cost of going to college
just how it's done the whole process of
education
if i could alter that and make it less
expensive
i could lower my own taxes so you would
create a situation where the company's
most capable of solving health care
most capable of solving education
would have an enormous financial
incentive to do it
and suddenly you don't mind so much
those big companies
because i think you would agree with the
following statement
if if if a big company is super
important to the country itself
you you're a little bit more forgiving
if there are some rough edges to that
company
wouldn't you say just a general
statement
as long as you're providing some
enormous benefit
you can be a little more forgiving about
any you know
things that are imperfect about it so if
those big companies which are
suffering quite a reputation hit if they
want to fix
two of the biggest problems in the
country and
tie it to their own self-interest and it
is pretty tied to their self-interest
that might be a healthy situation it
might be a situation where the public
says you know
i was mad about amazon for whatever
reason
yesterday but now i see that they're
helping give health care to poor people
and educating people i'm like well well
i like that part
so there you go somebody says private
would be better
well you know who knows if the solution
would look more private or public
to be determined all right
that's all i got for now and i will talk
to you
tomorrow
