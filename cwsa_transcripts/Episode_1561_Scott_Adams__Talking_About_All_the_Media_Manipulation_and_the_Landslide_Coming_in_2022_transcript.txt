well look let me put on my microphone
here
i'll bet that's better isn't it
yeah yeah
yeah it's time for the simulsip
you can call it discipleship i think
it's time to abbreviate it
and uh how would you like to enjoy
really one of the best experiences in
all of life
nay all of the civilization
paul thank you
audio looks good on both platforms well
all you need is that copper mugger glass
on tanker telstein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine head of the day
the thing that makes everything better
you watch you watch it makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
some call it the simulsip and it happens
now go
well here's a little thing that snuck up
on you
many of you know my
story that a number of years ago i lost
my ability to speak i won't go through
the whole story but it was an exotic
problem called a spasmodic dysphonia
and i could make noise but it wouldn't
be intelligible my vocal cords would
clench when i tried to speak
it's a rare disorder and it took me
three years to figure out what to do and
i found the only doctor in the world who
had a surgery
they could fix it it was risky
but i took it
and they fixed it
so there are tens of thousands of people
in the world right now who can't speak
can't have a conversation
because they don't know
that that one surgery that fix this
exists
you know they go to their doctor their
doctor doesn't know about it so i did
spend a lot of time doing some outreach
and
you know trying to tell people that it
exists as an option
etc but here's what i wanted to tell you
during those years when i couldn't speak
every time i got in my car almost every
time alone
i would
repeat an affirmation
and the affirmation was that i scott
adams will speak
perfectly
now this was a ridiculous affirmation
for two reasons
number one
prior to having any voice problems
whatsoever
i had a terrible voice
so what are the odds
that i would go from not being able to
speak at all
all the way past my normal terrible
voice
to something closer to perfect
very low
given that the problem with my voice was
literally incurable
at that time it was literally incurable
you know when i first got it even the
doctor who cured it didn't have the cure
yet he was still you know around
trying to find it
but
something happened in the last i don't
know it feels like the last few weeks
which is
i don't know if it's because my
allergies are not bothering me i don't
know if it's because i had sinus surgery
last year
and maybe
maybe it's you know all
working out for me about now
but
correct me if i'm wrong
my voice is damn near perfect now isn't
it
am i wrong because i can't you know you
can't hear your own voice
but
did i actually achieve
the impossible
i think it actually happened
what could be less likely
than someone who never had a good voice
and then lost their speaking ability
completely
what are the odds that they would be
able to do this
someday
have i ever told you about prisoner
island
i know i have but it's it's worth
repeating because when you see another
example of it
uh i think everybody should have a story
of themself
sort of an operating system or a code
maybe you could call it a philosophy
but i prefer to say it's a story about
yourself
and the story about yourself is the
story that you
you can rely on
everything goes wrong
there's a story of yourself
here's the story of myself
now it's a fictional story
but it's the story that i use as my
operating code and it's called prisoner
island
have you heard of it
prisoner island goes like this
there's an island in which prisoners are
dropped and there's no there's no warden
it's just a jungle there literally
and you just have to figure it out with
the other prisoners and survive any way
you can
and so in my story of myself prisoner
island
i'm dropped on prisoner island and you
know i'm i'm exactly me so i'm not the
biggest prisoner
on day one the prisoners beat me up and
rape me
viciously day two
the prisoners beat me up
and rape me viciously
day three
the prisoners beat me up and rape me
viciously
come back in a year
they'll all be dead
and i will be running
prisoner island
that's my story
and the story and the story is not about
you know
going to the top of prisoner island the
story is about
i will go deeper than you will go
the story is
no matter how far you're willing to go
i'm going to go deeper than that every
time
it's also the reason i've never been
afraid of a human being
like even scary human beings
and maybe you have the same experience
if you're male if you're female it's
probably reasonable to be afraid of you
know big scary men
but i'm not a big scary man but i've
never been afraid of anybody who was
because
i will go farther than they will go
and they better stay away
because there's nothing more scary than
somebody who's crazy
and i will go i'll go to crazy
right if somebody big tried to hurt me i
would go to crazy and i would just stay
there i would never leave crazy
because that's what it takes
if if that's what it takes
to win prisoner island i'm going to do
it
so the the moral of prison prisoner
island is
i'm going to do what it takes
now another version of this is the
millionaire's advice
which i repeat a lot it's the best
advice i've ever heard i wish i knew who
it came from it came from an actual
millionaire whose name i don't remember
and what you said was if you want to
succeed
figure out the price of success
and then pay it
that's it that's the whole deal
if you want to be successful
figure out the price
to be successful and then pay it
if you do that you will be successful in
my case it was working
seven days a week for ten years
that's what it took
it took me working seven days a year for
ten years
and you know there were other challenges
there for example losing the ability to
draw halfway through
by the way do any of you know that i
can't draw with my right hand right now
i've lost the ability to use my drawing
hand
so
if you were a professional artist
and you lost your ability to draw like i
actually can't use my hand anymore just
from overuse it's not carpal tunnel it's
a focal dystonia it's a whole different
thing
it's from overuse
and it's not carpal tunnel it's a focal
dystonia it's a different thing
but
prisoner island
if you if you've never been to prison or
island and you're a cartoonist and you
lose the ability to draw
you stop drawing you quit
but if you've been to prisoner island
you learn to draw left-handed
is that easy
nope
nope
drawing left-handed
is not easy
now i'm mildly ambidextrous so i
probably have a
you know a little leg up on that
but boy am i
am i uh
you know unwilling
to compromise on some things
and uh so now i draw left-handed it
takes a little longer i'm getting better
at it
and i have an art assistant who does the
finished work so i can get away with
some imperfections
um but anyway that's what i wanted to
tell you
somehow
that affirmation that was maybe the
least likely
affirmation i could have ever come up
with
actually came through
i don't know what this means about the
world really
because the number of times
i've had affirmations
for things that just seemed impossible
just impossible
and they happened it's really crazy
it makes you wonder about the whole
nature of reality really i will tell you
some other examples but you can read
them in my book
all right here's the funniest story of
the day bernie sanders tweets this
20 hours ago
we we must demand that the extremely
wealthy pay their fair share
period
why do people say
period at the end of a statement do you
know why
why did why do people say period
is because they don't have an argument
that's the only reason
you wouldn't say period
if you had any kind of an argument you
would just give the argument
but his argument is fairness
which is a concept as i often say a
concept that was created so that
children and stupid people
could have something to talk about
because do you know what's fair
nothing
nothing
there are things that you imagine are
fair there are things you say are fair
but there's nothing there's nothing like
fairness
in the universe you can't get yourself a
handful of fairness
you can't even get two people to agree
what's fair what is fair when it comes
to taxes
can can you define fair
what's fair i already pay uh the highest
percentage of anybody in the united
states
as a ratio i also work two jobs when i
don't need to
right
so so this entire profession if you want
to call it that the the live streaming
and stuff
it's you know a huge portion of my my
effort
and i don't need to do that
i don't need to do that but i do it
because it's good for the world good for
the country etc should i pay the same
taxes
as someone who's doing something selfish
why is that fair
why is it fair
that a selfish person is just doing work
just for their own benefit
pays the same taxes as i do
when i'm doing this really primarily for
other people's benefit is that fair
there's nothing this fair
fair is purely subjective and the moment
you say it's got to be fair period
you are signaling with extreme clarity
that you have no reason for what you
want
you just want what you want there's no
reason for it
elon musk replied to sanders saying we
must demand the extremely wealthy pay
their fair share period and elon musk
replied with this
and i quote
i keep forgetting that you're still
alive
[Laughter]
i keep forgetting
that you're still alive
now
i don't know if elon musk is the
funniest tweeter
now that trump is gone
but he's pretty close if he's not the
funniest tweeter now some of it some of
his because of his situation you know if
you're the richest person in the world
everything you say sounds a little more
interesting and a little funnier because
everything's you know amped up by that
fact
but that's a really good tweet
i keep forgetting you're still alive
this is why tesla doesn't need to spend
money on marketing
musk is the marketing you can't look
away
try to go a day without talking about
tesla
try it try going a full day
without mentioning tesla or elon musk
it's actually hard to do
i don't think i've gone a full day
without mentioning one of them
i don't know how long now part of it is
because i'm in california and they're
they're tassels everywhere so you're
just surrounded with elon musk
reminders all day long
and people telling me i should get one
uh like i i probably have that
conversation about three times a week
somebody telling me why don't you have a
tesla i don't understand
obviously why why wouldn't you have one
and i have to like explain all that blah
blah well maybe i will have someone one
day
all right here's a question for you
let's look back let's go back in the
wayback machine and
um do you remember
when china reopened the wet markets
how many remember that you know we we
thought the
the virus might have come from the wet
markets and then china fairly quickly
according to
what everything we knew about everything
they reopened the wet markets
and do you remember how appalled you
were
and how reckless that seemed
now think about how reckless that seemed
and then compare it to all the other
things that china did about the pandemic
one thing
looks terribly reckless
opening up the wet markets which didn't
seem necessary because i don't think
those wet markets have that much impact
on the national economy do they i doubt
it
yeah and they're not even phasing them
out
it'd be one thing if they said well we
have to reopen them because people need
to eat
if that's what's going on
but you know we'll phase them out as
quickly as we can
now
that's not what happened they just
reopened them
that would seem terribly reckless
wouldn't it
but then you look at the other things
that china did they they nailed people
in their uh
in their apartments
they yeah i think they're jailing people
and tracking people and they're insanely
conservative about managing the virus in
every other realm
insanely conservative but yet
but yet
in this one little realm
of reopening the wet markets they're the
opposite of every other way they've
acted with the pandemic how would you
explain that
there's only one explanation
do you know what the one explanation is
china knew
early on the wet markets were not the
source
there is no other explanation
there have been books written about
whether or not this virus was man-made
or came from the wet markets you don't
need any books
they would never would have reopened the
web markets if they thought if they
didn't know
if they didn't know it came from the lab
or somewhere else
you know i'm right
you know i'm right and who else has
mentioned this
have you heard anybody else say what i
just said
that there is no other explanation for
the web markets except that china knew
that that's not the source
there's no other explanation
it is a hundred percent inconsistent
with every other way that they act
it's the only way it can be explained
yeah
and and why did you have to hear that
from me
because did i introduce any new facts no
no i introduced no new facts
i just looked at the facts that every
one of you know
and i just reframed it
why did the news not do that for you
there's a lot of people in the news
why'd you have to wait for me
i mean think about it
yeah i mean this is another uh sign of
how easily we're manipulated by the news
the fact that we never even thought
about this and i didn't think about it
till yesterday
literally yesterday is the first time
that occurred to me
think about that
it's one of the most important questions
in the country and it's largely answered
it's like one of the big mysteries
completely answered and we didn't even
realize it all it was all right there
you didn't even have to look for
anything
so
all right here's another one
when
news of the virus first came out in the
beginning of the pandemic
do you remember that all the experts i
believe all of them
correct me if i'm wrong i didn't see any
exceptions i believe all of the experts
on viruses said
if this were engineered
we could tell by looking at it
do you remember that all the experts
said we would be able to tell
we just look at it and you'd know that
was engineered
right all the public experts
now
see if you had a
a different
opinion or a different experience
personally
whenever i talk to anybody smart enough
to have you know a reasonable opinion on
that question privately
every one of them said oh yeah that
could be engineered and you wouldn't
know the difference
all of them
everybody privately
who had any you know qualifications
said yeah you could do that and nobody
would know the difference
now i don't have any qualifications and
i knew that
do you know how
because it's obvious
it's obvious
all you'd have to do is
experiment with you know
mixing and matching and evolving from
species to species
until you got one that looked really bad
and if you looked at it on a microscope
it would look like it evolved naturally
nobody would know that you goosed the
evolution with you know selective
breeding and
whatever you're doing to to make
to make them mutate
so
if i do that
what's up with every expert who went on
television and told you that's not a
thing
i don't know anything about viruses and
i know that you could at least
mess with them to make them uh
mutate
and then see what they did
you don't have to be an expert to know
that right
so
i mean that's
the the amount to which we are being
bamboozled by this stuff is just
shocking
however bad you thought things were
they're probably worse than that
well uh and kerry went to that climate
summit and i guess the climate summit
people are all happy
because they made some kind of a big
agreement to reduce
uh carbon but toward the end i guess
india said you know
you know would be better than saying
we're going to get rid of coal
let's say we're going to phase it out
because we don't want to say we're going
to get rid of it we'll just phase it out
because phasing it out is sort of
non-specific so you can just keep using
coal
so i'm not sure that they got the big
win
um
but basically
kerry said that
we're we're on the right track now
so kerry basically said he did such a
good job and the other people did such a
good job flying over there in their
private jets
to talk about what we could possibly do
to reduce the co2
um and they said they did a good job and
we're on the right track now
so
climate change is solved
it's it's kind of a dicey situation
isn't it if you're the climate changes
are a guy
you can either say i went there and i
failed
or you could say i went there and
succeeded and it's not a problem anymore
we fixed it
i think he said something
suspiciously close to we fixed it
so he says we did realize that scott
didn't
what are you talking about
all right
so whenever i see this comment we did
realize that scott didn't i know you're
a idiot
right i don't even know what you're
talking about i don't even know the
topic but i know you're wrong
so tell me what it is you realize that i
didn't and i'll tell you how you're
wrong okay
you want to play that game
i don't even know the topic and i
already know you're wrong because the
way you the way you put it
um
okay i'm not going to see anything on
that
all right
so i think we're in pretty good shape
there um
our biggest problem now is that we've
damaged all the children into thinking
they have no future because climate
change is going to kill them can't kill
them kill them hard
all right
here's a tweet by uh doc anarchy
md
also known as dr anarchist
a very good follow on
uh on twitter if you like to see the uh
the contrarian views on a lot of the
pandemic stuff
and he tweets this
he says if you're supplementing vitamin
d without getting any sunlight you may
as well be taking a sugar pill
agree or disagree
if if you're supplementing vitamin d
just taking a pill
it's a waste of time if you're not also
getting sunlight agree or disagree
agree or disagree
uh i see lots of disagreements
i say lots of agreements
i'll tell you what i think i know
but i would need a fact check on this
right so i'm not your doctor
so this is what i think i know and this
is based on what i learned during the
pandemic about vitamin d
apparently you can't go outside and get
enough vitamin d
did you know that
it's not even a thing
so the thing that everybody is advising
you including dr anarchy it isn't a
thing
did you know that
you you all believe that you could go
outside and get your vitamin d from the
sun
it's not a thing
now i'm exaggerating
i'm exaggerating
here's what i mean by it's not a thing
the only time it works
is in some climates
in some months
i live in california the you know
probably the sunniest place you could
possibly live
and i can only get enough vitamin d by
going outside maybe three months a year
how many of you knew that
that if i if i just went outside every
day in the winter even in california
where the sun's out there's no clouds
i would not get anywhere near my vitamin
d level do you know that
how many of you knew that
you can't get it by going outside can't
even get close
right and here's the important part you
can't get close i'm not saying you get
80
i'm saying you know we're nowhere near
it
right
now let's say
let's say that's not good enough so you
realize that the sun
the sun isn't always good enough now in
the summer in the summer in california
yes and in other places they probably
have a month or two where yes but there
are there are entire zones of the world
where there isn't any time you can go
outside
if you live in sweden
can you go outside and get
vitamin d if you live in sweden
can you get vitamin d by going outside
well you get some
but nowhere near what you need
and that's why the people who live in
sweden and nearby
they supplement
with cod oil that's my understanding
so that uh culturally it's a very common
thing to supplement with cot oil or some
other kind of vitamin d
now let's say you live in america or
somewhere else and you just go to the
store and you buy some vitamin d in
in a package
and you take your vitamin d and it's
just off the shelf
how how good is that vitamin d is that
if you take a lot of it
i don't want to say what a lot is but
let's say you take you know
something on the large larger size of a
safe dose whatever safe is
is that going to help you
is that going to give you the vitamin d
you need
nope
in the hospitals they don't give you a
pill because it doesn't work
you know they're gonna put you on a drip
because apparently that does work
but they're not gonna give you a pill
it just doesn't work
here's another mind blower
you know your vitamins
and your supplements that you take once
a day
why do you take vitamins once a day does
anybody know
why you take vitamins once a day
when there are so many other medicines
you might take you know twice a day or
four times a day
yeah the answer of why you take vitamins
once a day has nothing to do with uh
effectiveness
is marketing
they tell you to take it once a day so
you remember it and it turns it into
habit
because if you take it once a day you
usually match it with your
brushing your teeth
don't you
do most of you match your vitamin taking
with your teeth brushing
because that was what the marketing was
intended to do
because if you think oh once a day and
it's in my medicine cabinet while i'm
brushing my teeth twice a day you know
there we go
so
everything you knew about vitamins is
probably wrong
years ago i tried to start a company in
which i was going to make a vitamin and
a vitamin fortified product called a
dill burrito so a burrito
with various flavors but they'd be so
fortified that if you only ate that
burrito you'd have enough of everything
for the day
and then anything else you ate would be
bonus but you'd have everything you need
if you did one burrito
do you know it was impossible to do that
it couldn't be done
and when i studied can you get enough
vitamins and minerals from just a good
diet
do you know you can't come close
how many of you knew
that if you have a really good diet you
you just let's say it's a mediterranean
pick whatever's your best diet one
that's got lots of nuts and vegetables
and
green leafy vegetables and you're eating
lean protein you're doing everything
right
how close do you get
to the daily recommended vitamins and
minerals does anybody know with a
perfect diet how close do you get to
your recommended vitamins and minerals
maybe 30
that's it you don't get close
if you do the math of what you eat and
then you know and what vitamins are in
there because it's usually on the
packaging or you can look it up and then
compare that
to what the government says you need
it's not even close
you cannot eat a balanced meal now go to
your doctor
and say should i take a multivitamin
what's your doctor going to say
well it depends but your doctor might
say
no you don't need a multivitamin if
you're eating a good balanced meal
is that true
well it might be true that you don't
need it which is a separate question
from
can you get anywhere near the
recommended minimums
you can't
there is no such thing as eating a good
diet that gets you to the vitamins and
minerals that you need you can't get
there not even close
do the math yourself you could prove it
to yourself you know i did the math
um
so very much like vitamin d we have this
myth that you can get it
do you know how you can get more vitamin
d
neither do i
neither do i do you know how you can get
enough vitamins and minerals in the
right kind of usable form beats me i
don't think it's possible
i don't think there's any way to do it
because the supplements don't make that
much of a difference
and a good diet doesn't get anywhere
near it
so can you get all your vitamins and
minerals i don't think so
can you get all the vitamin d you want
as far as i know no
there isn't any way to do it unless
you're hospitalized and then you can
right so
some of these things that we just take
for granted are just
it's sort of like that
don't go swimming within an hour of
eating
how many of you still believe
that it's dangerous to go swimming
within an hour of eating because you'll
get cramps do any of you still believe
that's true
because it's been debunked
but
yeah i mean when i grew up that that
would seem to be true even though it was
obviously not true because we always ate
and went swimming we never got any
cramps it was pretty obvious that it
wasn't much of a risk
all right um
i found a new way to determine who the
npcs are you know the non-player
characters the people in our environment
assuming we are a simulation
and not a real a real society which i
think is fair
the odds are we're a simulation um how
do you tell who are the npcs and who are
actually uh avatars that are you know in
the game
well i don't know but i'm looking for
tells and here's one of them
some of my critics keep telling me that
um i have a flaw
and that when the data changes i
sometimes change my opinion
and they say this
in public
they say it in public
that when i change my opinion based on
the data itself changing
or having new data
that that's a flaw in me
that i should keep my same opinion
no matter what we learn
and they say this right out loud right
in public
now they can't be real people can they
how could they possibly be real people
they have to be npcs they must be
programmed with some
limited number of responses and that's
just one of the limited responses
because nothing that could think
independently would have that opinion
right
all right here's another one
my critics keep telling me
that i'm wrong when i make a
statistical um prediction
if i say something's like 75 chance of
happening
and then it doesn't happen
people say you were
wrong that might be an npc situation too
because if i say there's a 75 percent
chance of something happening and it
doesn't happening that doesn't mean i'm
wrong
i mean i could also be wrong because
they may have calculated the odds
incorrectly but that's a different error
you're not wrong about what happened
because you just put a statistical
likelihood on that's all you did
so if you think that means somebody's
wrong or you or you feel you have
certainty when no certainty is is called
for
here's another tell
if you're certain
you made the right choice on the
vaccination you might be an npc
now the exception would be people have
specific medical problems
right there are some people who have the
extremes
and you could be pretty confident you
made the right decision but if you're
anywhere in the middle
and i think i'm somewhere in that middle
zone where it's not completely obvious
which way to go
um you know because i'm fit but i have
you know one comorbidity i don't know if
it's the bad one you know asthma
who knows so i i can't calculate my own
risk if if you think that you can tell
if i made the right decision
you might be an npc because i can't tell
i can't tell if i made the right
decision
let me ask you right here
how many um so i decided to get
vaccinated so i have i have two shots so
far i haven't made a decision about the
booster
probably i'll get one
but i haven't made a decision yet i'll
wait as long as i feel comfortable
waiting before i make a decision
how many of you
are positive i made the wrong decision
go
now not people who think i likely made
the wrong decision
but how many are positive i made the
wrong decision go
um
i i think i scared away all the npcs
yeah it's unknowable
right so so why would anybody criticize
me for my choice
how could you criticize anybody for
their choice if they're anywhere in this
middle zone where i am
most of you are in the middle zone right
most of you don't have a clear cut
you know i have three comorbidities or a
clear cut i'm 12 years old
and i don't talk to people anything like
that
mandators
now
there is also a persistent rumor that
i'm a big supporter of mandates
does anybody think that
how many of you think i'm a big
supporter of mandates
that's literally the opposite of what i
am isn't it now i think this came from
saying that the first two was it two
weeks we were going to lock down for two
weeks
i definitely favor that
now when i say favorite i mean i didn't
disagree with it
which is different than favoring it i
guess i would say i didn't push back on
it because i thought well it's worth a
try
if there are enough experts that think
this is worth a try
and it's the fog award we don't know any
better
two weeks is like a good risk reward
kind of thing
but after that it it sort of rapidly
became clear that that wasn't going to
be the answer
um
yeah i've repeat so but i but i did say
the first two weeks was worth a shot
low risk
um
then start persuading against mandates
well you think i'm not
do you think i haven't persuaded against
mandates
i i tell you almost every time i'm on
here i'm against it but
um i think the mandates are really just
a power question
it's just a power question the public
has the power but they have to
they have to take it
right it's not just it's not automatic
they just have to have enough people on
one side and then they just take the
power
uh the golden years yeah i think the
golden years are right on track
sometimes it looks darkest before the
dawn but all of this um
stuff that's happening that's making us
rethink civilization fairly
fundamentally is what we needed to do
you know um
all right yeah i think the golden age is
still looking very good actually i'm
very happy about it the only thing that
scares me is inflation at the moment
um
let's see
i saw an interesting uh thread by
michael bang peterson
who has uh many qualifications that make
him qualified to say this sort of thing
and his thread i'll summarize it
um he thinks that um
trying to force the unvaccinated will
only strengthen their
resistance and cause terrorism
what do you think
so his his view is that um once you've
got all the easy to persuade people on
board
that if you try too hard with the
unvaccinated people it's it's going to
backfire
okay that feels right to me so
everything i know about persuasion says
yes yes and yes
completely right
so
let's say
that you wanted to persuade this group
but you didn't want to make it mandatory
because you you honestly believed it
would be good for them and good for the
world
uh but you still want to give them their
their freedom to make the choice
how would you persuade them
now you could argue that it's unethical
right you could argue that it would be
unethical to persuade people
but i'm going to give you what i think
is the most ethical
persuasion and even this is a little
sketchy it goes like this
the fake because
the fake because
but maybe a little bit real in this case
here's what i mean
imagine if you will that there's
something that the anti-vaxxers have in
common
is there anything they have in common
i think so
i think within the conservative
anti-vaxxers what they have in common
is probably conservative
wouldn't you say and uh
also pro-gun
wouldn't you say
so this will never happen but i'm going
to give you an idea of the concept
suppose suppose biden said you know
damn it the most important thing in the
country is to get people vaccinated now
i'm not saying that but suppose he did i
suppose he believed it
and he was doing what he what he thought
was best for the country so there's no
bad intention in this hypothetical
and suppose he said you know
this is our biggest thing
here's the here's the deal i'm going to
make
for one year
or let's say as long as i'm in office i
won't sign any gun legislation
but you have to get vaccinated
we have to get to 85 vaccinated
and if we don't i'm going to sign every
gun gun law that congress gives me
but
if you get vaccinated at 85 percent
i'm gonna back off i'm just gonna wait
you know i'm not gonna say i'm against
it or for it i just won't sign anything
for my term nothing on guns
what do you think
now
now
uh if the gun if the gun idea is too
radical
and it is i mean i use it for a fact
imagine if there's something else
suppose he said to you i won't raise
taxes
i won't raise taxes
if you get vaccinated up to 85 percent
of you
is there anything that biden could offer
or the government could offer
that would get you to say damn it i was
sort of close to the edge but you know
leaning on vacs
but now you offered me something that ah
i kind of do want that
how about this
are you ready
how about this one
uh since critical race theory is not
taught in schools
it should be easy to get people to agree
to remove it
because nobody as uh adam dopamine
pointed out on twitter today
nobody is complaining
if if you asked to get rid of bigfoot in
the schools would anybody complain
well not in a normal way they wouldn't
complain they would call you crazy but
they wouldn't complain about it because
they'd say well we don't have bigfoot in
our schools so yeah you can get rid of
it
the left is saying they don't have
critical race theory
so why would they complain about getting
rid of it
so why not offer i'll tell you what
i'll create a commission
to look for critical race theory in
schools and we'll get rid of it
but you got to get vaccinated
okay again that will never happen
but the point is
is there any kind of a deal biden can
make
so that he's not forcing people to turn
into terrorists
by resisting the mandates could he
buy their
cooperation as opposed to
forcing it
because if somebody if somebody agrees
to the deal
yeah okay ah damn it i'll take that deal
then they don't become terrorists
because they say well this is the deal i
agreed to
anyway i don't see the exact way to
solve this but i think think of it in
terms of a deal
might be more productive than thinking
of it as a mandate
does anybody agree with the
concept
that turning into a
a voluntary deal of some sort
is the only way this could work
it's got to be turned into a
non-band-aid
that still has you know some persuasive
power if you wanted to do it
now i you may you may be opposed to
anything that uh moves people toward
vaccinations but that's a separate
question
um
here's another
way to get things done persuasively you
know as i was saying since the left says
that critical race theory doesn't exist
in schools
only in colleges because it's a college
level course
and the right says it sure does we can
see plenty of examples of it in the
written documentation it's all over
one way to do this would be to argue no
no crt is there and then they say it
isn't and then you're kind of done
because you're arguing definitions
the other way to do it and this is good
persuasion is to enter their frame
now you have to kind of know what you're
doing to make this one work this is sort
of a high level persuasion
but if you enter their frame it means
accepting their frame and then breaking
it from the inside
and so let's say you accepted the frame
that it doesn't exist
that there's no crt
you know it's there
but you accept their frame you know
you're right there is no crt but you
know it would be great
if we could do a full audit and give
that to the conservatives and prove to
them that there's no crt
would you let us prove your case
let us help you
because you're making the case that
there's no crt
and the conservatives are not believing
you so let us do an audit
we'll call out each of the instances
that we think
you know might look like it and then you
can show us how that's not actually part
uh could not be called critical race
theory
so how about we help you make your case
that's entering their frame
now how does anybody object
to you helping them win their argument
it's hard right
no we're on your side we're going to
help you win this argument
by auditing and proving there's no
critical race theory
um i'm not saying that would work it's
just an example of how to enter
somebody's frame and break it from the
inside usually that's
on things that are really really
contentious that's sort of the only way
to do it
i don't think there's a second way to do
it
all right it looks like the polls are
speaking loudly that some abc poll
that's a new one said that 51 percent of
registered voters
say they'd support the gop candidate in
the district and only 41 percent say the
democrat
that's the biggest lead for republicans
in this poll
in 40 years
the gop has the biggest lead
in 40 years do you know what this
doesn't include
massive democrat retirements
which are also predicted
so we have
unprecedented poll
differential
also on top of it
unprecedented number of democrats going
to retire
on top of it
and we're only 11 months in people
[Laughter]
this is just the first year of the
uh
this is just the first year
of uh
of biden
and it looks like just everything just
keeps getting worse according to the
public so
um you know people could talk about the
great reset
well apparently the great reset is
coming in 2022 but it's not what people
thought it would be it looks like the
great reset is people realizing that the
democrat policies just didn't work
and that your news is all
fake
now
there is a possible tipping point coming
it goes like this
if you're on one side let's say you're a
hardcore democrat
and you're watching the news and you
find out that your news source got
something wrong
and they they sort of fooled you
you say well they got everything else
right
i'm going to give them a pass for
getting that one thing wrong there then
they get a second thing wrong
you say well damn it that's two things
wrong
but still all the other stuff is right
so you know nobody's perfect two things
wrong i'll let that go
but we've now reached a level of hoaxes
that are confirmed hoaxes
that it's sort of crazy to imagine that
this is anything except planned
organized persuasive
and the new texture of the news that
it's fake
i feel like the democrats are going to
notice
they're going to eventually notice
that everything is fake at least the
political news is pretty much 100 fake
news
and i think that
there there's some there's there's some
tipping point that's coming
where even the democrats are going to
say whoa whoa whoa
i've been believing this stuff for the
last five years
and now i can see that all the stuff
lately is fake
what about the stuff i believed
we're right there
now people go to their teams so strongly
that massive amounts of confirmation
bias and cognitive dissonance will keep
them where they are despite all evidence
changing all data changing despite
better arguments despite anything they
find out right it's really sticky
but it's not unbreakable
right
cognitive dissonance is super strong but
not unbreakable
there is some amount
that will convince you that hitler did
actually kill a lot of jews if you know
what i mean there had to be some point
in world war ii i'm no historian so you
know this may be a bad example
there had to be some point where people
were just denying the obvious
don't you think
people was like oh that can't be
happening
i don't think that's really happening is
it does it really happen i don't think
it's really happening because you would
have to act radically differently if you
knew what was happening
but then there reached a point where you
just
you just couldn't possibly deny it
anymore right
so no matter how much cognitive
dissonance you have it's still
vulnerable
it's just hard and i think we've reached
the
the mountain of fake news that's
confirmed fake news
that even people on the left are going
to say oh god i didn't realize how bad
it was and i have to admit i didn't
realize how bad it was either
i thought it was bad
you know you've watched me talk about
the fake news for for five plus years
some of you
so obviously i knew it was bad but i
didn't know it was this bad
did you
i mean this is actually surprising i'm
pretty skeptical
about how bad things can be with
information
but even i didn't know it was this bad i
mean i was kind of fooled
and and i was definitely leaning
leaning very hard in the fake news
direction and i
i'm actually amazed
all right
general flynn uh suggested in some
conservative meeting i guess recently if
we're going to have one nation under god
uh which we must
we have to have one religion one nation
under god and one religion under god
so i want to say officially that general
flynn is dead to me
all right so i was a big supporter of
him um getting out of his legal jeopardy
because i didn't think any of that was
fair but this opinion is a sufficiently
crazy town
that you you need to start ignoring him
at this point
now he says some other things that i
thought were sketchy and i thought
but that's a different issue you know
he's still being legally railroaded so i
was more about the legally railroaded
part but once you see him free and
talking
um he's a nut job and you shouldn't pay
any attention to him
like the the worst thing in the world
would be to imagine for him to have any
authority in government i think
now
this is nothing against your religion by
the way
i'm pro-religion
i'm pro-religion
but
it's the united states
still the united states
uh and one religion no
no no no
no and no
oh somebody's saying flynn did not say
that
does any does anybody else have that is
that fake news
is the quote a fake news
because i'm looking at uh something
that's in quotes
but is it fake news i i'm actually
willing to believe that
all right send me uh send me a link
uh to anything that would show that's
fake news so i'll read it again so this
is this is in quotation marks so
allegedly this is a quote and you're
going to tell me today that uh with a
link that's fake news or maybe taken out
of context
is there a way that this could be taken
out of context because it doesn't look
like it could be but
that's that's how you get fooled
are both sides reporting it
uh well fox news reported it and and
he's their guy
so
but that's a good question
cnn you'd think would want to say bad
things about him and report that but i
think i only saw it on fox news
or did i see it the other way around
um scottsdale is saying it's too on the
nose you're right about that it is too
on the nose
but you don't usually see something in
quotation marks
well it could be it could be fake news
yeah based on what we've seen this could
be fake news
why don't we put a pin in this
and you will tell me tomorrow if it's
fake news okay
if it's not fake news uh i think you
need to be done with general flynn
forever
uh but if is fake news then we will all
revise our opinions
okay
um yeah the fine people stuff was
unquote exactly so it could be just
taken out of context but because this
has so much context in it i suspect
that's not the case well you'll you'll
let me know i'll be open-minded to this
being fake news
all right
the written house prosecution has asked
for reduced charges
and can can you help me on the facts was
it reckless endangerment with a firearm
or something
is that is that what they want to go for
now
can somebody give me a fact check on
that
reckless endangerment with a firearm
something like that
i'm seeing some yes
so do you think that there's anything in
this case that would suggest a reckless
endangerment with a gun
here's what i
think do people think guns are for
is this exactly what a gun is for
it's like the whole point of a gun
which is there's a dangerous situation
that people might need some protection
and so he brought a gun
is it reckless endangerment to bring a
gun
to a situation where people are in
danger and
need protection
that feels like exactly the right thing
to do
secondly
when he was handling the gun was he
handling his gun in an unsafe way
i didn't see any evidence of that it
looked like he was keeping his barrel
down
and it looked like he had some training
he looked like he knew firearm safety
and just from the outside it looked like
that
so that didn't look reckless and then
how about the actual acts in which he
was shooting people was that reckless
endangerment or was that just pure
self-defense
i'd say it was pure self-defense
now here's the question
that maybe the prosecution will ask
which is did he bring this upon himself
by bringing a weapon into a place where
a reasonable person would have known
that could have attracted trouble
what do you think
is it reckless to take a weapon into a
place that
you know it's going to attract attention
again i say
that's what a gun is for
a gun is for to go into that situation
right
that's exactly what a gun is for
to go into a situation where
things are unpredictable and dangerous
and people might have bad intentions for
you
that's that's what the gun's for
so
i would say there's no chance of uh in a
common sense way that reckless
endangerment makes sense but in a legal
way who knows who knows maybe he can
sell this
maybe because he went so big
trying to ask for murder charges and
he's not going to get that i don't think
maybe maybe that's like a big first
offer and then the jury says
oh okay well you talked me down from
murder to this reckless thing yeah we
don't want people
we should make a
make an example of him we don't want
people bringing guns to situations so
yeah let's let's just give him some
reckless endangerment and maybe that'll
keep other people from coming
now the jury is not supposed to think
that way right
the jury is now supposed to
make an example of you
that's exactly what they're not supposed
to do they're supposed to just judge
that
the facts either make it a crime or not
a crime
um but i don't know how you could stop
people from thinking that way if you put
me on the jury i would definitely be
thinking
what message are we sending
i'm not supposed to but i would be just
like everybody else
so
on one hand you could imagine that the
jury might say well you know for the
social good
we're going to give him a little bit of
a you know maybe even jail time i don't
know how much is reckless endangerment
worth in terms of jail time
uh
you know i would like to think it would
be time served if that's what happened
but i don't know
um i would say that reckless
endangerment is a pure opinion what do
you think
in this situation it would be a pure
opinion it would not be a finding of
fact
yeah yes it would be pure opinion and we
don't put people in jail for opinion
well we do but we're not supposed to
they should be just doing a finding
effect
so i think reckless endangerment is not
something that is subject to fact
to me that looks like pure opinion you
can imagine situations that are just
obvious to everybody but this isn't one
of them
you know certainly it's probably well i
say it's probably good to have this law
in the books
because there have to be cases where
somebody is just
you know playing with a loaded gun and
somebody gets killed and yeah they need
to answer for that
but that's not what happened here he
wasn't playing whatsoever
here's how i would have taken this if i
saw the prosecutor asking for murder and
then i saw that the prosecutor had no
evidence for that charge
what would i do for the lesser charges
what would you do
let's say you thought the lesser charges
might actually be fairly valid
but you watched a prosecutor ask for
murder with no evidence for murder
you watch that happen right in front of
you and then they go oh how about this
lesser charge
how's your attitude now
you put me on that jury
i would not convict him for jaywalking
if there were 100 witnesses
and 50 videos
because once i found that they tried to
railroad this poor bastard
with a murder charge with no evidence
no evidence
once i learned that there is nothing i
would convict him for
and i was in that jury trial and i would
lie my ass off
i would say no i don't see the evidence
for this reckless endangerment thing
nope nope nope nope don't say it
even if i did see it
now in truth i don't see it
based on what i've seen but i'm not on
the i'm not in the room
so i mean i don't see it but if i did
see it
even if i saw it so that the facts
totally supported reckless endangerment
i'm letting this guy get off a period
that's not even negotiable i'm sorry not
negotiable
you do this to an american citizen and
by the way
let me be as specific as i can
if kyle were black
i'd be saying the same thing
if kyle were you know an illegal
immigrant
i'd be saying the same thing
no exceptions
if you try to if the if the government
tries to put you in jail on gin dub
charges
i don't care what else you're charging
him with
he's walking
you know
i would hang the jury so hard
you know even if it came to fisticuffs
there's a limit to how much you can push
the public
that would be my limit i don't know what
your limit is but that would be mine it
wouldn't matter how much evidence they
had for these lesser charges
no way
no way and again it doesn't
matter what ethnicity is doesn't matter
his gender has nothing to do with that
this is just a um
this is just a justice turned upside
down and we don't stand for that in this
country
we don't stand for that
i'm sorry
i've said before
and i'll say it again
that i think only one thing holds this
country together and it's our court
system
nothing else keeps the country together
it's the fact that even when we hate the
decisions from the court
we respect the system
even when we hate the judge
we respect the system
and even when we hate the outcome
we respect the system
because the system is pretty well
designed
relative to you know
what your alternatives are it's a
well-designed system
and as long as the courts continue to
have our trust
and i think they do i mean the supreme
court's sort of a special case because
that's politicized but the courts in
general do have our trust
they're not perfect
but we don't think that they're trying
to be imperfect right it looks like a
mistake when they're when when something
goes wrong
so that's
uh
i think we have to appreciate
that that's the jewel
that's the jewel and the entire republic
if we lose that we lose everything and i
would argue that every country that
can't reproduce
our republic or any kind of a democratic
system any country that can't make one
of those is because the court system
doesn't work
like until you get the court system
right
nothing works
and i would imagine that there are big
cultural differences
in terms of you know just
i don't know the mindset
that makes a jury trial work and people
don't want to automatically railroad
people and whatever
and there there's something about the
the american experience
that makes us somewhat absolutist about
this
court's need to be working
stuff
and i would say
we do a pretty good job
you know warts and all we do a pretty
good job with the courts and i respect
them
um
yeah that you certainly people do get
railroaded and you know the legal system
has a process for that too i mean you
can sue
so we even have recourse when there are
injustices so you know we all wish it
could be better
but
um
but it's probably as good as you can get
yeah and i was going to say
it has a history that goes back to great
britain primarily
france a little bit too
you historians let me know
uh go on false says
prosecutors have political bias against
second amendment shouldn't be involved
with gun cases
uh there can't be a bias in the
courtroom well yeah i mean every lawyer
has a bias right you can't get rid of
bias and lawyers
that wouldn't make sense at all
um
the january 6 committee will further
shred our america
maybe
but look at 2022
i feel as if
the public is rising up
meaning that
you know the public is watching and
they've made some decisions
i don't think those decisions are going
to change
um
we need a j4 committee
yeah
what do you think of liz cheney's mental
state you know
i don't care too much about liz cheney
i suppose i'm supposed to because she's
in the news a lot
but i don't know i just don't really
care what she says or what she does
should i i mean i get that she's
contrarian and stuff but really is that
is that interesting enough
i don't think so
um
name a sport that wouldn't be more
entertaining if they allowed fighting
like hockey does
tennis would be a lot more entertaining
by the way i've said this before but all
of the sports in the world are broken
they're all broken
tennis is broken because the racket's
got so good
that anybody with muscles can hit the
ball harder than the opponent can return
it especially a serve
so you should get rid of the serve
tennis would be fun if you got rid of
the serve and in fact there is a version
of tennis in which you get rid of the
serve and i've played it it's way better
how about soccer and out of bounds and
offsides
just get rid of that
yeah soccer would be so much more fun if
you got rid of the offsides rule
totally
and you didn't have out of bounds so
indoor soccer has that advantage because
the ball just bounces off the wall but
get rid of atom bounds and get rid of
the
you know the
all the time wasting stuff make the
goals bigger so there's more
you know more goals so it's more fun to
watch
and yeah
pretty much every sport except
football
is ruined because either our attention
span changed or something about the
equipment changed
uh to make it a different kind of a
sport football is is a modern enough
sport that i think it grew up with
technology and it grew up with um sort
of modern everything
uh ice hockey has a problem that is hard
to watch
i think ice hockey is probably more fun
to play than to watch
i think you have to have had played
hockey to actually enjoy watching it
you don't know what you're talking about
on soccer
yes i do
do you know how much soccer i've played
in my life
i played a ton of soccer as my was my
primary sport for years
and yes i know exactly what i'm talking
about i know why the offside rule exists
and i prefer not having it
um i'm also for your golf ball is the
last place you saw it okay golf is
completely ridiculous
you heard about the golfer or some pro
golfer who made all of his golf clubs
specialized to be the same length
and then he then he started winning
because they make golf clubs different
lengths for no good reason it just makes
it harder to play golf because every
stick is a different length
so he just made them all the same and
didn't lose anything just got better
uh and yes you shouldn't spend your time
looking for the ball
so golf would be great if there was
nobody behind you
and you didn't have to spend all your
time looking for a ball
because looking for a ball is like
shopping
or like work
looking for the ball feels like work to
me it doesn't feel like
anything
he also gained 30 pounds to have more
power
oh the guy who did that has a degree in
physics well that makes sense
because he did the the only smart thing
that anybody's ever done in golf
um
golf is a good walk ruined yeah who said
that was it mark twain or somebody
did they have golf during mark twain's
time
uh he had massive muscle changes right
oh put rfd uh tractors in the bowls yeah
there's got to be some way to find your
golf ball
i also don't think driving should be
part of golf
here's some controversy i don't think
that
driving same with serving in tennis
serving ruins tennis because you're just
always waiting and picking up bowls and
stuff
but driving should just not be you
should just be uh chipping and putting
because the people who can drive well
um
there's just a genetic thing you know
they can just hit it a mile because
they've got whippy
whippy skills and if you don't have that
what makes golf really not fun if you're
playing with somebody who does have that
you know because you're halfway to where
they are and they're waiting for you
so just make it all
chip in chipping
button and then you've got a good sport
yeah i know most of you like it just the
way it is
and that's fine all right i think we've
uh done all the
all the live streaming we need for now
now i think you'll agree
that this was the best show you've ever
seen
from me
today and
i think you would agree they just keep
getting better
it's amazing isn't it just keeps getting
better
i got one more paid comment here
