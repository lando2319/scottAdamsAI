well i'm told that it takes about 10
seconds
about 10 seconds for the youtube feed to
start
is it there i'm working on a a drum
opening
for the show sort of like a tucker
carlson you know drum drum thing where
he opens the show but different
you know my own thing
uh it'll be about 10 seconds long so i'm
working on that but you know if you'd
like to enjoy today to the maximum
potential all you need is a cup or a mug
or a glass a tanker chelsea stein that
canteen a jug
a flask of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
well
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here today the
thing that makes everything better
can you feel it
can you feel it already things getting
better yeah you can feel it
go
ah
the caffeine climax
the thing that makes everything better
as i said
i think you're feeling better right now
aren't you
well boo the cat is uh continuing to do
better she's not eating
on her own but she's having a good time
she looks healthy
so i'm hearing more about the
combination of bitcoin and
power plants
nuclear power plants coal power plants
gas
power plants
so it turns out that bitcoin is a really
good combo with power plants that don't
have to that don't operate at their peak
all the time
now i heard
a claim
that i'm a little suspicious of so
here's the claim
that a coal plant a coal-fired you know
coal energy producing plant
is actually going to produce less
carbon
if it operates continuously
than if it just gets fired up and and
taken down based on load and demand
do you think that's true
i don't know
yeah i'm seeing somebody say it's true
i don't feel like that's true
but i'm going to treat it like it's true
for the point of today but
my my economics uh
bs detector says i get the point
right i understand the point that
there's a startup cost per se and the
shutdown costs per se
and that you know
they're so great that it's not worth it
maybe
maybe
but i'm going to say that all of my
instincts
doubt that's true
not 100
but
a serious skepticism about that however
people believe it's true apparently and
so the opportunity to use the bitcoin
mining
to keep all of our power plants
operating at whatever is their optimal
rate
seems like a good combo
so you get the bitcoin money for for
free basically because you're you've got
a power plant that wasn't doing much in
that time
free is an exaggeration it's not free
obviously
um yeah apparently you can still at
least one
bitcoin miner says that uh the cost of
mining one bitcoin
is about three thousand dollars
whereas the bitcoin itself might be
worth you know somewhere in the
neighborhood of forty thousand dollars
so the margins are pretty good if you
got yourself a
big old power plant you can use
well by the way i should warn you that
none of the news is super interesting
today
i mean i'll do what i can
yes butters you did miss the sip hey
everybody butters just came in
on youtube
uh and missed the sip
would anybody mind if we do
just a special one for
butters butters get you cup
i i will not disappoint you today
butters
half of the reason i'm going to do this
for you
is because your username is
butters
possibly one of the best usernames i've
ever seen
butters
well butters
this is the special simultaneous sip
without the preample
just for you everybody lift your glass
butters is in the house
this is for you butters
yeah that's good i'm so glad you came
butters you made all of us happier
i don't know are you always like that
butters
when you enter a room does everybody
just smile they get happier
something tells me that you're like a
good force in the world
see as soon as butters came in here
everything got better didn't it
you were sitting here thinking you know
what i really need is another sip
i'd really like that and then butters
comes in
and makes it happen
like nothing
we need more people in the world like
butters
and fewer people like britney spears
father
who who had been
enslaving her in a conservatorship
with her 60 million dollar fortune
does that seem low to you
doesn't britney spears with only 60
million i say only
60 it seems low doesn't it
what happened to all of her money
i'm not sure anybody can estimate
anybody else's money
uh i i've seen my own
net wealth estimated in
you know in public
not so close
they're just purely guesses
but anyway uh so britney spears has her
life back so she doesn't have this
conservatorship at least her dad's not
part of it
and
she celebrated with an instagram post
where she's taking flying lessons
britney spears is taking flying lessons
now
have i told you that the simulation
reveals itself with code reuse
code reuse yeah
i mean
most of you probably know that christina
my wife has took flying lessons she's a
pilot now
and now brittany's doing that i don't
know how many people we hear about
taking private
flying lessons
but i do love the fact that britney like
i saw this in the comments
somebody said this you went from the
most
uh restricted person you could think of
because of the
ship to literally flying
you know literally like flying through
the air anywhere she wants to go
eventually that's a pretty big change so
so good for her
why is it that we all like britney
spears
have you ever ever
have you ever wondered that
somebody says i don't you don't like
britney spears
seriously
how could you not how could you not like
her i mean you could not like her music
i mean that would be normal everybody
has different musical tastes
but
doesn't she seem like just sort of a
good person who's just trying to get by
and she's got some personal problems
like many of us
i don't know
everything about her
i kind of like
yeah
she's just likable
so
here's some more news about the nation's
hottest governor
if i say the nation's hottest governor
who am i talking about
let's see if we all have yeah okay
took you about half a second
have somebody said desantis
ron desantis the hottest governor well
he saw it in a different way
um so we're going to be totally sexist
and talk about governor christie gnome
who
in addition to being politically quite
successful
it must be noted
is unusually attractive
now this of course is positive and
negative it probably helps her
politically i would imagine
but now she's being uh dragged into the
news so she's happily married
and just the the worst freaking thing
happened see notice i said freaking
see i'm learning
i'm growing
i'm becoming a better person right in
front of you
i could have used the f word but now i
went with ricken
uh
so she's being accused of having an
extramarital affair with former trump
adviser corey lewandowski
now um
apparently there's more
looks like there's more uh truth to the
fact it didn't happen there's nothing to
it than there is that it did
but
of course we're seeing all of the
lieutenants being taken out you know in
anticipation
um
oh thanks fred
that's an unusual uh amount of attempt
there 13.99 for that comment
totally worth it
anyway
um here's what's creepy about this story
a few things
number one
here's a public servant who's you know
looks like a happily married woman with
a family
and because she's attractive
uh the world is trying to take her down
and
and they're matching her with corey
lewandowski
now
let me ask you this
if you were
the hottest governor
and let's just say she's not even just
hot for a governor
but she is unusually attractive for a
human being right this is important to
the story it has nothing to do with my
personal opinions i know
that you know somebody in the comments
always says scott you're alone
that's nothing may keep me out of the
story
it's just the fact that she's unusually
attractive and is part of the story now
if you were unusually attractive
i mean like
like everybody's talking about it
attractive that kind of attractive
would you want to be paired in a rumor
with corey lewandowski
no i don't want to be unkind
all right i'm not you know what you'd
call a good-looking guy myself
so i feel like
you know i'm not being condescending
when i say this
corey lewandowski is sort of like my
people
you know what i mean
right
like if you heard that
uh christy gnome was rumored to be
having an affair with me
like actually me
it'd be a lot like hearing it was
corey lewandowski right what's the first
thing you'd say to yourself
couldn't she do a little better than
that
[Laughter]
right
what do you think
if she were inclined to have an affair
which apparently she did not have so let
me be as clear as possible
there doesn't seem to be truth to the
rumor
and i i would say that i you know i'm
super skeptical about i doubt i doubt it
but imagine the double insult that not
only do you have to deal with this
stupid rumor and your husband and all
this stuff i mean it seems very
inconvenient
but they
they paired her with corey lewandowski
seriously
you couldn't find
a better looking guy to throw into that
rumor you know somebody who's you would
also say you know
she might be one of the most attractive
politicians we've ever seen
who who would be who would be the
equivalent that at least you'd say well
maybe
maybe
so i think the best thing about this
story is that
do any of you believe it
do any of you believe it
how many of you believe this story
that christy gnome
would have an affair with corey
lewandowski and again i don't mean to
insult corey lewandowski
so corey lewandowski is just sort of the
ordinary guy
sort of the same category i'm in
just you know ordinary guys you know
we're not monsters but nobody's gonna
say let me put your picture on my wall
you know nothing like that
so
yeah
i don't see anybody believing it here
yeah okay good for you
good for you everybody who doesn't
believe that you're on the right track
but super sexist and unfair to christino
who is doing nothing but trying to mind
your own business but here's the side
story to this
the side story is funnier than the main
story the side story is that politico
uses this opportunity
to go after corey lewandowski for a
completely unrelated claim
that some other woman
who was married to a big donor
republican donor that uh you know the
the report is again low credibility
these are all low credibility reports
don't assume any of this is true but
it's being reported so i'll tell you
about it
and the the accusation is that
corey lewandowski got drunk and he was
getting a little handsy with
some
donor's wife at a dinner and
said some inappropriate things
so that's the story but here's the funny
part of the story
the name of the woman
who was the wife of the big donor that
corey lewandowski allegedly was sexually
annoying
her first name i'm not making this up
trashell
t-r-a-s-h
e-l-l-e
now
obviously
her parents expected a boy
and the boy's name i'm assuming would
have just been trash
trash odom
uh but because they got a girl instead
she was trashell
trashell
is that a real name
i feel like
i feel like maybe they don't love their
daughter if they named her trashell
exactly
what kind of a conversation was that
when they were looking through the baby
names they're like okay jennifer ashley
uh savannah
um oh here's one how about trashell
now when you name a child it is your
responsibility
to consider all the things that that
child's schoolmates
will say about that child's name in the
future
am i right
you do have a responsibility for example
in my town where i grew up
there was a kid whose last name was cass
c-a-s-s cass
and parents named the the kid john
that's not bad right john
john cass it's a pretty good name
what they didn't count on is that since
the father's name was also john i
believe they they decided to call the
son jack
that's right they literally named their
their son jack cass
jackass
that actually happened in my town i this
is somebody i knew well i'm not making
this up a real person named jackass
now
again trashell
i have nothing against you trashell so
this is not personal you didn't name
yourself i guess
but your parents
sit down and have a talk with your
parents i feel like they're
maybe you weren't so happy about having
a baby
how's the baby
trash trash hell
well elon musk continues to entertain
apparently he passed jeff bezos again
they've been training first place for
richest person in the world
and musk was asked about it and thus
said he'll send bezos a silver medal
that's like a big number too
he's going to send him a giant statue of
a big number too
now
here's
here's what i love so much about this
and maybe something i love about musk as
well just as a public character
you're not really supposed to brag about
how rich you are right
like it's sort of if you're the richest
person on the whole planet
you're really not supposed to be
bragging about it and i don't think he
is exactly i think he's joking about it
not bragging about it but he's joking
about it by bragging about it by saying
that he'll give bezos a silver medal
which is one of the funniest things i've
ever heard
because getting a silver medal for being
the second
richest person on the planet earth
it's just a funny concept
[Laughter]
and the fact that musk gets you know
free marketing and publicity by saying
stuff like this
is just
wonderful
um anyway so i just point that out but
here's the other thing so now that musk
has over 200 billion at least on paper
he's going to be the first trillionaire
do you realize that
if you take
uh musk's age
and then you see how many times you can
add 10 years to it
if you assume that his
wealth doubles every 10 years which
would be conservative actually that
would be conservative
in 20 years it would double twice
so it's going to be 400 and then 800
he's going to be a trillionaire
he's going to be the first one
unless you know bezos pulls at it or
something else pulls in but literally
elon musk will be our first trillionaire
that's pretty cool
all right
i realized uh yesterday that i should
share with you my stock
conflicts of interest
do you think i should do that let me ask
your opinion
when somebody does what i do which is i
talk about
companies and politics and stuff like
that i feel like i should tell you what
stocks i own because that could inform
you about my bias right
so i thought i'd do that
i don't know if i have any obligation to
do this but it feels like it'd be fair
that was funny
so
here are the stocks which uh this is not
all my stocks just ones that might have
some conflict of interest so yesterday i
bought and by the way these are not
stock recommendations
do not take these as financial advice
i'm just telling you my conflicts of
interest i do not recommend these stocks
to anybody
i bought some regeneron stock yesterday
again i don't recommend it it's a small
part of my portfolio just sort of a few
companies that i'm just gambling on so i
would say that's more of a gamble than
an investment
but i have a small gamble on regeneron
so if i talk about regeneron keep that
in mind
likewise i have an investment in the
israel
and index fund of israeli companies
i've mentioned this before it's not the
first time i'm saying it in public
but i do have a fairly sizable
investment in israeli companies the
thinking there is that it's sort of the
silicon valley of the world
so basically i'm betting on their
security situation continuing to improve
and on their
education system and their
entrepreneurial system
producing and so far i've you know
doubled my money in israel israeli
stocks
so if i talk about israel you'll know
that i have a financial interest now i
was pro-israel before i invested
so i don't think my investments made me
pro-israel i've always been pro-israel
uh but you should be aware of it it's
fair
now here are the tech stocks that i also
bought at the when
um when we had the kova dip so at the
bottom of god my nose is itching sorry
uh at the bottom of the uh
coveted pullback when the stock's all
tanked
i bought
a bunch of tech companies
i bought tesla
all right so i talk about tesla but you
should know that i also own some stock
amazon
apple
twitter
snapchat which went up 400 since i
bought it
in the uh in the pullback and microsoft
now again i'm not recommending any of
the stocks they were just stocks that
tanked and i figured that it was a good
buying opportunity so i own them so when
i talk about any of those stocks remind
yourself that i own
stock
in them
all right
um
that's why you liked
so that's exactly the same kind of
comment you should make
so i saw in the comments that's why you
liked musk's comment because you have
tesla stock
well i don't think so
i don't think that's why i like this
comment i think i just liked his comment
but it's exactly the right question so
you should hold that in your head that i
could be biased and i wouldn't know it
well what is wrong with us uh
collectively as people when the
there are three stories in the news
today
one is about a guy killing his wife and
two of them about a mother killing her
children
now there's a lot of crime and killing
in the world
but why do these
three stories become national news
with all the murderers and killing and
stuff
and how many of these people are white
people
oh all of them
oh all of them
they're all white people
really
there there weren't any black people
lately
that have any kind of a you know tragedy
that would be newsworthy
only white people had newsworthy
tragedies
right
now
i'm you i think if you've been watching
me for a while
you know i'm not the social justice
warrior everything's got to be equal
blah blah blah blah but i do feel like
the complaint that this is about you
know white people missing
is pretty close to the mark
right now i get that it's based on how
many people are going to click on it so
that the news is just following the
public but
between the news and the public
it does seem like it's excluding a lot
of the country
is that not affair does anybody disagree
with that comment
um
it feels like that right like no matter
how opposed you are to political
correctness
the coincidence starts to pile up after
after a while kind of hard to ignore
but i'm even more appalled by the fact
that we find this entertaining that we
click on it
do you click on these stories about
somebody killed a family member
i try not to click on those
i don't like to reward that
yeah i don't like to mention the names
dwell on the details i just this just
shouldn't be news i'll tell you what
should be news
have you seen the viral video of the
florida man
who trapped an alligator with a garbage
bin and actually got the alligator in
the garbage bin
by by putting it on the side and like
shoving it into the alligator and the
alligator goes wild and ends up in the
in the bin
and he pulls it up and he's actually
captured an alligator in a garbage bin
now i love the fact that it starts with
a florida man
because you know the the running joke
that i mean any story that starts with a
florida man is going to be a wacky story
you know there's going to be some crazy
stuff going on if it starts with a
florida man
in the news a florida man
trapped an alligator with a garbage can
um
there are a lot of fun stories coming
out of florida i'll tell you
well here's an update on permanent news
permanent news
the news that never changes even when
the day changes
well and this will surprise you but it
turns out that the infrastructure bill
stalled
did anybody see that coming
i know a surprise the infrastructure
bill is stalled
again today
like yesterday and the day before it's
always a different reason
although joe manchin has been a big part
of the reason lately
yeah so it's stalled that's the whole
story
um
chris hayes
commented on twitter in all caps
so you know he's serious about this
all caps folks
hold on put on your seat belt i'm going
to read this tweet that's written in all
caps intentionally it's going to blow
you right out of your chair here it is
and i have to read it the way all caps
must be read if it were a regular tweet
i'd be like blah blah blah blah but it's
all caps so i have to read it like that
there is no brutal fiscal reality that
nation faces it is entirely made up now
he's talking about joe manchin saying
that there's a brutal fiscal reality
that we can't spend trillions of dollars
without
getting in trouble
whereas chris hayes says there is no
brutal fiscal reality
what could be more
of a difference of opinion
than somebody thinking we're spending
trillions of dollars
and somebody else also educated
also follows the news
and
and uh
sorry i just saw a comment that just
completely threw me off my game there
so which is true
can we spend trillions of dollars
for and it's free
because it pays for itself
or does it just cost us trillions
dollars and we're all dead
those could not be
those could not be more different could
they
how in the world could both of those
movies be playing on the same screen
now i get i get when people say oh
trump's a monster and then other people
say he's a savior i see how those movies
can play on the same screen
but how in the world
does one movie see trillions of dollars
and one movie see nothing
how do you get that
well we have massive economic ignorance
that's how you get it
all right now as i tell you way too
often i have a degree in economics
i've got an mba
and i don't know the answer to this
question
i'm not even close to the answer the
answer to the question is can we spend
trillions of dollars on infrastructure
and is it free
or will it destroy the country
i don't know
i don't know
i don't even have a good guess
to me it would be kind of a coin flip
50 50. i mean based on the fact that i
don't have any any hint which way this
goes
what do you think and by the way let me
say this as clearly as possible
you don't know
right
if you have a degree of economics let me
know in the comments and then tell me
your opinion but for most of you you
don't have to you don't have any kind of
degree in economics
so you definitely don't know if spending
the trillion dollars is free
or destroys the country because we don't
have trillions of dollars
that we could borrow
i mean we could borrow it but maybe we
can't pay it back too easily
economists are often wrong that's right
but at least they would understand the
question better you know they might get
the wrong answer but at least they'd
understand the question
honestly i have a bad feeling about it
somebody says right if it's free why
would you stop
why would you stop at 3.5
why not 10 trillion it's free
so
i don't i i think the answer is probably
not either extreme right it's not free
and it's probably not going to destroy
the country
if you don't know why risk it oh there
we go
so brandon i believe has an economics
degree and asks this reasonable question
if you don't know
if it could destroy the country
why risk it
that's a really good answer but like
that's now that's somebody who's an
economist
that is a perfect
economist response
if you don't know
if it would be good or bad
why would you do
it
that's a really good question
i think most of us agree that if you did
just the infrastructure part
you probably come out ahead or at least
you needed the infrastructure even if it
didn't pay for itself you still have to
do it
uh but when you get to the you know the
larger 3.5 trillion
if you don't know it's going to work
why would you do it
you know
of course we don't know any of our plans
are going to work right so to be to be
fair it's always a calculated risk but
if we don't have any visibility at all
usually you're saying okay usually this
sort of thing works like vaccinations
you know we're not flying blind with
vaccinations entirely
because you know we've developed drugs
before we have some intuition about
things but with with this death stuff we
don't have any intuition about this
there's no math and there's no intuition
they can tell us if this makes sense
i don't think the experts agree right
all right
do you know if china is surplus or debt
i think china doesn't have debt the way
we do right
that's a good question i don't know the
answer to that i mean lots of companies
have debt over there and that would be a
problem especially the real estate
companies
all right uh dr interracial tweeted at
me
today to alert me to uh there's a new
dnc campaign ad
they're running to try to attack ron
desantis
now that makes sense because they're
going after you know the corey
lewandowski's the ron desantis trying to
get ahead of you know the next elections
and take down people they think are a
risk
but here's uh here's the funny part
the the democrats campaign ad against
ron desantis
reads like
a campaign ad for ron desantis
it is probably the worst conceived hip
piece you've ever seen
because you're watching it and you're
thinking i think i kind of like ron
desantis based on what i'm hearing
and the campaign aid starts in an
airplane that you know everybody's got
their face masks on and the announcer
the
flight attendant says we're entering
florida
where you know you won't have masks and
you don't have to get vaccinations and
you can go anywhere you want
and the implication
is that going to florida is a big
dangerous thing because ron desantis is
ignoring all the science and doing
dangerous stuff that's that's what
they're trying to sell you
but they miss the mark
so badly
that it comes off looking like a pro
desantis ad because it basically says
rod desantis will give you your freedom
and we won't i mean that's what it says
ron desantis
will give you your freedom
but we won't
that's what the frickin ad says
how in the world did they think that was
a good idea what
what kind of a insulated
political
life do you have
that nobody told you this was a bad idea
i mean i think they just made ron de
santa's president
if you go to if you go to florida the
governor will make sure you have freedom
come on
that's like the best thing you could
ever say about this guy
yeah they're so tone and deaf
now is this an example where the left
only listens to themselves
it must be right because i feel like the
right wouldn't have made this mistake
when was the last time you saw
a
campaign ad from the right
where you looked at me said huh this
this is working in the opposite
direction it looks like it looks like
the right doesn't even understand what
the left is thinking
you've never seen it
because the right
understands the argument on the left
they disagree with it
but they've heard it
they've heard it
and that's different because the right
knows what the left is at least talking
about and thinking
but the left has no idea what the right
is thinking or talking about because
they don't consume that media
yeah
so think about it think about the fact
that
democrats have consistently made ads
that work against their own interests
and republicans haven't
it's all different people
it's definitely a republican democrat
difference
well the taliban is warning that
there will be some
some kind of consequences
if the u.s keeps flying drones over
afghanistan
because that's
violating their sovereignty to which i
say
that is kind of violating their
sovereignty isn't it
it does feel like that's pretty
violating their sovereignty but you know
of course we have legitimate security
reasons to do it
and i'm wondering what exactly is the
taliban going to do about it
i mean i think we do it because we can
right there's nothing they can do about
it they can't really shoot down our
drones too easily at least not yet
so
would they retaliate by sending drones
over here
do you think you'll ever see a taliban
drone in the united states you know
attacking something over here
maybe
yeah
it doesn't necessarily have to come from
the taliban but you're definitely going
to see drones attacking in the united
states probably the small ones you know
the the hobby ones
all right uh
the numbers don't lie have you ever
learned that
that numbers don't lie
so if you're going to look at the data
to figure out you know let's say what
country did better than some other
country on covet you just look at the
numbers
because the numbers don't lie right as
long as you have numbers you know
exactly what's going on
except
except this example
so a tweet
claiming it doesn't matter who because a
number of people have done this claiming
that one of india's uh
i don't know provinces or whatever
they're called states or provinces i
don't know
uh had something like zero
covades and it's because of ivermectin
how many times have you seen that
there's a there's some
area in india that doesn't have any cova
because of hyvermectin as soon as that
ivermectin came in boom
the death went down to zero
have you heard that
okay none of it's true
none of it's true
and beyond that
apparently the death count in india
might be undercounted by a factor of 10.
they think that 400 000 people in india
died of covet
it might be 4 million
it might be
4 million
smart people are saying that it might be
4 million
they just don't keep the records the
same way we do
i doubt it's 40 million but 4 million
wow
so
anybody who thinks that ivor mechtin
solved the problem in one of their areas
would have to explain why the other
areas are not using it already
so that's your first question
if it totally definitely worked in this
one area of india
why isn't all of india doing it well the
answer is none of it's true the area
that we're talking about
we don't know how many people died it's
probably ten times as many as whatever
is reported
but secondly
um just the numbers are all wrong
basically everything about is wrong and
the the the area uh andres backhouse was
pointing out that if you added together
the natural immunity in the area from
pre-infections plus vaccinations
that explains the dip
i
so many people in that area are either
already infected
or they got the vaccination that there
wasn't there weren't many people left in
fact
so of course it dropped had nothing to
do with iberbectin
so if you see that it was ivermectin
that's not true
let me give you the worst
argument
i've seen
now again this isn't about vaccinations
yes or no
this is about arguments okay
again i don't care if you get vaccinated
it's just about whether your argument is
good because i think there are good
arguments both sides if i ever said that
outright
let me say it outright
i think there are good arguments
on both sides of this question
but each of us have to make a decision
and whatever decision you make you're
going to have to live with the fact that
the other side had an argument
you know it wasn't nothing
they did have an argument you could
disagree with it
you know i do disagree with the argument
on the other side for my own risk
profile not for the rest of you you have
to do your own
but anyway
here's the worst argument
uh the vaccinated people have two risks
not one
they have the risk of the covet itself
because even if you're vaccinated you
can still get it you can still get
long haul covered maybe
and you then you would have the risk of
the vaccination itself
on top of the risk of the virus
so this was an actual tweet
that getting vaccinated doubles your
risk
because now instead of the risk of just
the virus you also have the risk of
getting vaccinated itself
wait somebody's saying exactly
you're not agreeing with that argument
are you
i hope you're not
[Laughter]
nobody's agreeing with that are they
because i just i set it up as the worst
argument that anybody ever made
but i think a few of you are agreeing
with the argument
um
all right
well here's what's wrong with that
argument do i even need to tell you
do i even need to explain what's wrong
with it
oh i'm being asked to explain okay
um
this would be the same argument for
anything good
name anything that you think
worked to make you safer
seat belts
if you add seat belts
you've got the risk of the crash because
people with seat belts still die
but then you have the added risk of the
seat belt
what if the seat belt hurts you
that's two risks
instead of one you only had a risk of
dying in a car accident
but now you have a risk of dying in a
car accident because you can still die
in one with seat belts but on top of
that you have the risk of the seatbelt
itself
two risks instead of one
all right
my point is you can take anything good
and just say it created two risks
instead of one
how about you go to the let's say you
have a an illness
you need a heart bypass
let's say you need a heart bypass
so you've got a risk from the heart
itself and now you decide to get an
operation
that's two risks twice as bad right now
you get a risk of the operation and the
risk from the heart
every time you try to fix something it
introduces a new risk
but that's not why that's not a reason
not to do it
you have to look at the total amount of
risk it's not one and two
risks you don't count risk says here's
one
you have to see how much risk right you
don't just say well i got two risks
that's twice as much as one
you have to look at the whole situation
all right
um i have a hypothesis
about why it is that i trigger more
cognitive dissonance than other people
now first of all i don't know that
that's true but observationally
it seems that if you look at my twitter
feed there's more
cognitive dissonance than others why is
that in the comments
if it's true let's take it as a
speculation but assumption is true why
do i trigger more cognitive dissonance
than the average
commenter
um
i'm resolute in my assertions
no
not that maybe the opposite of that
you try harder you intend to
uh it's the topics like
it's something about the topics surely
the ambiguity no
the subtlety
okay that's close
here's what i think um you've probably
heard greg gottfeld talk about
uh the
tyranny of uh
of you know that what is it called the
prison of two ideas
the prison of two ideas that there's
just a yes and a no for every issue
one of the things i do is i'll often
find the third position
the third position will always trigger
cognitive dissonance
if if the world is decided there are
only two positions because the third
position is almost always the reasonable
one
the two position world is when people
just took sides
if there are two positions that you can
identify it usually means the media just
assigned those
to you
the left assigned one position the right
assigned another position and people
just accepted them
but if you have a nuanced
opinion
anything that looks like some kind of
middle ground both sides get triggered
into cognitive dissonance so i trigger
the left and the right at the same time
twice as much triggering
so i don't think it's an accident
that i get more cognitive dissonance
because i'm triggering both sides
usually you're just trying to trigger
one other side but i'm triggering both
sides at the same time
let me give you an example
now this doesn't necessarily apply to
your opinion right i'll just speak
generally so some people say
vaccinations are good and you should all
get them
other people say vaccinations might be
dangerous
you should maybe not get them
so that's the prison of the two ideas i
say
vaccinations are probably good can't be
sure
just my best guess i mean we have no way
to know for sure but probably
probably good
but you shouldn't necessarily get one
that's the middle ground vaccination is
probably good
and i decided to get one for myself but
your profile is not my profile of risk
so you don't need to do what i do and i
certainly don't suggest that you do
so as soon as you find that middle
ground the people on the right think
you're siding with the left which i'm
not the people on the left think i'm
siding with the right which i'm not and
then both of them are triggered into
cognitive dissonance
because the middle ground almost always
sounds more reasonable than either
extreme
so when people are talking about the
extremes that's usually just a trigger
or a signal of cognitive dissonance
all right
here's an example of that john grant on
twitter tweeted this at me today
so look for the absolute
john said why do you speaking about me
he says why do you believe every
prescription drug that isn't a mass
killer like fentanyl must be then be
safe and effective
what
how in the world can anybody watch any
of my content
and then characterize it as me believing
that
uh every prescription drug is safe and
effective
that could not be further from anything
that i think is true
but
john grant thinks he saw it
that's cognitive dissonance
so it's somebody who believes there's an
absolute in play when there's nothing
like an absolute in play here
um
so look for absolutes as your
signal
for cognitive dissonance
um
straw manning
i'm not sure what you mean by that
yeah aspirin would probably not be
approved by the fda if it came in today
that's correct
scott you're a contrarian
am i
i don't know that i'm a contrarian
i think contrarians are sort of
automatic
i'm not automatic
i disagree with a lot of stuff but not
automatically
i thought micro doses of fentanyl are
used in surgery yeah in a medical
context it's very useful
um
yeah they think i'm a contrarian because
i'm not a joiner of either team
am i a provocateur i am but i don't um
i don't know that i've ever tried to be
that
you can be a provocateur without that
being your mission it just ends up being
that way
all right let's just go look at your
comments for a few minutes uh where's my
iphone made in china
yeah so my view again here's another one
of those um
this is a perfect example so i'm seeing
people uh question my use of an iphone
that's obviously assembled in china
and
what is my view about doing business
with china can can anybody explain my
view
do i have do i have an extreme view that
we should not do any business in china
or do i have an extreme view that we
should do all the business that we want
in china with no restrictions
am i on either of those extremes
no
no i've said no new business
that would be crazy and i've said
repeatedly and consistently that if
you're already over there that's a whole
different situation
so i think tesla and apple
they have to satisfy their
shareholders
and and i'm one of them i just told you
i have shares of apple and i have shares
of tesla as a shareholder
they do have a
fiduciary responsibility to me
and to the other shareholders and they
have to figure out how to within a legal
context they've got to figure out how to
make us some money and they're kind of
trapped over there i don't know if they
have many options in the short run
it's it's new business
that i'd be concerned about not the
stuff that's already there
so i don't ask them to change it's just
not practical the the economist and the
the business person in me says that's
too much to ask
nobody could really make that big of a
change that quickly in the long run yeah
in the long run would i like to see
tesla and apple get out of china oh yeah
yeah and i'm hoping they're working on
it but in the short run
not much you could do
talk about rawlings
oh
did rawlings move to china
did that just happen
if you have a link to a story about a an
american company moving business to
china
you should send that to me
tweet that i'm sorry tweet that at
me
jeep
i haven't heard about that
um
here's another theory i have that
if we're a simulation then some of us
are npcs and one of the ways you might
be able to tell an npc
is that they take absolute opinions
because if you were going to program
npcs you'd keep it simple wouldn't you
you just have them
pick one of the major opinions and stick
with it i don't think you would add a
lot of nuance
to the npcs
you know the the non-player characters
that are part of a simulation
so i feel like when you see somebody
who's got cognitive dissonance because
of a
of an absolute opinion
maybe they're just non-player characters
look up npc oblivion compilation well
that sounds interesting
um
why would a simulation preclude
death i don't think it would
be careful in bible study last night it
was pointed out that jesus stephen and
paul were all killed
when the crowd couldn't answer their
questions
well i suppose that could be my fate but
at least i'd be a martyr maybe somebody
write a bible chapter about me
all right i'm gonna need to go and do
some other things
um
but i hope i am not blamed for the news
not being that terribly interesting
today
i guess biden was getting booed at a at
the congressional baseball game but
there were probably just as many people
cheering him so i think that was fake
news
and
uh yeah the book of scott
why not the book of scot
well i tried to keep it light and uh
curse-free and uh maybe give you some
optimism about things today i'm gonna
i'm gonna take that as my um
direction from you
now one of the one of the things that
i'm quite committed to
with all of my work really is that if
you do any kind of uh artistic content
and i guess in a sense this is some kind
of art
um if you're not if you're not changing
it because of the audience reaction
you're not really a good artist
i think a good artist needs to be
continuously you know polling the
audience and finding out what you're
doing wrong and correcting it so i'm
going to try to correct my cursing
and i'm going to try to correct my uh
negativity that i think slipped into my
into my presentation
you know and i'm glad that you were uh
policing me on that
because it i didn't need to add some
negative negativity to a negative world
um i think the reason you know maybe the
one thing i could add is some positivity
uh to a negative world
yeah yeah i know that many of you like
the cursing but here's here's the
trade-off
there's nobody who would sign on to
watch this because of the cursing i mean
unless it was just a novelty day or
something but people will leave because
of the cursing
so here's a good marketing tip
nobody comes for the cursing but they
might leave because of it
and it's the same with that
sexual content
people don't really come because you
might say something naughty but they
might leave because of it they might not
they might not tweet it because of that
um yeah and i also believe um
the stand-up comedians who curse too
much are lazy
do you believe that
the stand-up comedians who curse too
much are just lazy or not funny they
just can't write well
and the ones who don't need it you know
the seinfeld etc they're operating at a
whole different level
yeah
and
the reason that i slide into it i i feel
so this is my
self-criticism
it feels lazy
when i do it
because i know i can get a reaction from
it right you can always get some kind of
juice flowing into your audience if you
if you swear so it's it's a little too
easy
because everybody can do it right
and if you're going to create an
entertainment product as this is
you sort of have an obligation to try to
do
uh
some things
that are you know a little different
than what everybody else is doing
so if you're just doing the obvious that
anybody in the audience could have done
swear it stuff
what have you added really nothing
yeah don't use common phrases in writing
same thing exactly
yeah there are there are times when it
will be necessary
right
there will be times when it's necessary
but
as a normal thing nah
i don't think so
all right uh that's all for tonight
for to now that's all for today and i
will talk to you
tomorrow you
