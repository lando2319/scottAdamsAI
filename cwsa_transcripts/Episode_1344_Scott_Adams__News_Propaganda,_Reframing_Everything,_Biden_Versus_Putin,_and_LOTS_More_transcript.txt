unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to be a good one today
go
oh it wasn't good it was great
so let's talk about all the things
number one i don't know what you would
call the best thing about the pandemic
if there is such a thing but i would
like to nominate
on my short list of best things about
the pandemic
a uh video which i tweeted around this
morning
in which mick jagger teams up with dave
grohl
for a duet over zoom and i guess they
wrote the song
they wrote the song just about the
pandemic that's really good
and i don't really know if the
if it's good because of the context
you know that i wanted to hear i
basically wanted to see those two do a
duet about the pandemic
you know as soon as you see it you're
like yes i do want this i do want to see
this
but i'll tell you what made me feel the
best
mick jagger is 77.
he's 77. and
you know you can tell he's a certain age
but my god he acts like he's
just age didn't affect him somehow how
does he do that
i don't know
here's the other best thing about the
pandemic that looks like the worst thing
but it might
eventually turn into a good thing which
is the teachers unions
um their their malign influence
the toxic toxicity of the teachers
unions
is now laid bare and i think education
is
just gonna going to fall apart because
i can't see that what we know now about
the teachers unions
what we've seen about the schools
especially during the pandemic
i think their stranglehold is in real
trouble
and i've heard don't know this is true
but i think you might see some big
companies such as apple
or google getting into the education
space
and if they do um that's all you need
for homeschooling
now when you say homeschooling don't you
imagine
there's a student sitting in the living
room all bored
and one of the parents has to say you
know keep watching that screen
like when i think about homeschooling i
it doesn't sound good
but i don't think that's the real model
i think the real model will be
people who just say hey you live in the
neighborhood
you do homeschooling i do homeschooling
too
let's use the internet and get together
and we'll we'll have our little
homeschool people
you know over at my house today and
maybe over at your house tomorrow
but it's easy to imagine a
self-organized
very socially socially engineered system
where kids don't go to school and get
bullied
rather they're in their own neighborhood
dealing with
neighbors and you know there's no
bullying because you sort of selected
the people in your group
or at least there'd be less so i think
that's one of the great things that's
going to come out of this is that the
school system was exposed as the enemy
of the people
and that's going to change um
i keep telling you the parity and
reality have merged
but every time you hear another example
of it it's
it's really shocking all right so here's
another example
where try to figure out if this really
happened
or if it's just a joke all right
did this really happen um
was there a bbc diversity chief
you can stop right there if you want to
make your own joke i'll get i'll pause
to let you insert your own joke
there's a bbc diversity chief
okay do your joke now let's go on who
says that uh
i think it's idris idris idris elba's tv
detective luther quote
isn't black enough to be real because he
doesn't have any black friends
and doesn't eat any caribbean food
so there's that uh that's what the bbc
diversity chief says not black enough
which is probably a big surprise to
uh idris or idris elba that he's not
black enough
but comment on that from titania
mcgrath now if you're not following this
account
you really need to it's a titania
mcgrath all one word and it's a parody
account in which
somebody allegedly named titania mcgrath
who's not a real person
basically agrees with stuff in the news
and it's just hilarious
because she's agreeing with you know the
the most ridiculous parts of the news
and she comments on uh or whoever it is
comments on this story
in a tweet and says thrilled to see
someone finally calling out ija's elba
for not being black enough
quite frankly with all my pioneering
work for social justice
i'm far blacker than idris elba could
ever hope to be
now you'd have to know that her profile
picture is a blonde woman
so that that makes it funnier
all right here's uh example two
where parity and reality have merged you
ready
is this a real story or is it uh a
parody that uh the playboy is now
featuring a plus-sized
model in their newest edition
do you think that playboy decided to run
a plus-sized model
is that real or is that parody
it turns out it's real uh david
hasselhoff's daughter
haley hasselhoff um is the plus side
size model and she's she's going to be
the playboy feature
now we don't do fat shaming here if i've
told you once i've told you a million
times
we don't do fat shaming but i should
point out
that if the entire purpose of your
magazine is to show
unnaturally good-looking women what are
you doing
now i'm not saying that plus-sized women
should not be in magazines
i'm not saying anything like that i'm
saying
if you're a playboy isn't that the
opposite of your brand
and can you really survive if you go
opposite your brand i mean didn't people
look at playboy because they liked the
brand
now to their defense i would say that
playboy probably can't exist
as a naked picture magazine
even digitally because is there anybody
who doesn't have
infinite access to naked pictures you
know it's called the internet
so playboy doesn't have much of a
purpose in terms of the
the models it just doesn't have any
purpose anymore
so maybe they're just flailing around to
find something that works
i would like to give you the following
pun that does not come from me
so the first thing you need to know
about this pun it wasn't for me
it was from a woman all right that
softens it a little bit
this came from a woman i'm just
repeating it
and it's very unkind so you shouldn't
laugh
and what angela says on twitter about
this playboy having a plus size
model is that it's an example of and i
quote
fattening the curve that's not funny
angela you should be ashamed of yourself
you should be ashamed
and if any of you are laughing at
fattening the curve
you've got some work to do do the work
do the work
well here's uh some of the dogs not
barking this week
um so these are the stories that
don't exist and you don't know why
don't know why there are three dogs not
barking number one
we keep hearing more and more about cue
and their stories in the new york times
about
how to deprogram the cue believers and
all that
and still things are very quiet about
who was behind the cue
now some people say well we know there
was this documentary where somebody said
they found the guy who's behind it and
he's sort of kind of but not really
admitted it but sort of maybe kind of
but you're not sure
really this q thing is one of the
biggest things in the country
and it doesn't really matter who is
behind it i would say that matters
now when i say behind it i don't just
mean the person posting
because it was obviously being boosted
by you know whoever wanted to boost it
which was probably china and russia
right so
things are really quiet about who's
behind the queue
and it's just so jarringly obvious that
it's being ignored
you have to ask yourself why i don't
know why
but if it's not an intel operation i
would be really surprised
or if q q may have started as you know
something as a prank or whatever it may
have started as one thing
but certainly at some point it became an
intelligence operation
and probably not just american probably
foreign american who knows maybe some
combination
but we don't hear about that here's
another story that i haven't heard
has anybody put together statistics
on how many citizens are killed by
police
when not resisting arrest
just the category of people not
resisting arrest
now i'm not defending the police because
if somebody's resisting arrest
that doesn't mean you get to kill them
i'm not saying that there's got to be a
better way to do some
some things than the way we're doing
them i completely agree with anybody
who's protesting who says
why don't you get more creative there's
got to be a better way totally agree
with that
but how many people do get killed when
they're not
when they're not resisting i would think
they're
the only thing left would be the
category of
mistakes where somebody thought they saw
a gun but
it was something else that's probably
all that's left right
and so i would argue that we have a
pandemic
of um
basically a pandemic in which we believe
that people are killed by police
but what we really have is a pandemic of
resisting arrest
what if what if it were reported that
way suppose the media
said we have a pandemic of people
resisting arrest
and the and the obvious outcome is that
people are getting killed
it's the same story right all i did was
reframe it
but none of the details are different
but if you thought this was a story of
racism and cops killing black people
you feel one way about it and if you
if you simply had been told by the news
forget about whether this is true or
false
just see where i'm going here if the
news has simply decided
that the way to report this was to say
we have this pandemic of people
resisting arrest
and getting themselves killed that
easily could explain
everything you see couldn't it but the
way you feel about it would be
your your your hair would not be on fire
you'd be thinking why are so many people
doing this like
what do we do about that is it really a
police problem
or are they just it puts them in a
situation where the risk is higher
and so if the police do not act
perfectly
which is hard to do in a ten situation
nobody acts perfectly all the time
in complex chaotic situations
so that's a lot to ask of the police to
not make a mistake in those situations
alright here's another one where is my
one example of a citizen
who wants to vote but can't figure out
how to get an id
on day one i was perfectly okay
with no examples on day two
i started to think ah it's been two days
feels like you could have found one
person to put on the news
to say i can't figure out how to get an
id which would be weird because the
moment the person said that
somebody would help them get an id
literally
the same moment if you saw somebody on
tv
who said i can't get an id because i you
know it costs 35
or i don't know how what would be your
first impulse
well i'll give you 35 you know somebody
would
maybe you wouldn't but i would yeah i
can afford 35
if somebody came to me and said the only
thing keeping me from voting
is i can't afford to get my uh
my original birth certificate so that i
can
get an id and it would cost me 35
i'd say oh here you go problem solved
or if they said i don't know where to go
or how to do it i'd say
huh i don't either but let me google it
oh here you go
problem solved part of the reason that
you can't surface anybody
is that their problem would be solved
the moment they surfaced
so the one person who couldn't solve the
problem would have it solved for them
immediately let's say a hundred people
came forward
and they all said we don't know how to
do this can't solve it
one day all solved because other
people would solve it this is one of
those problems where
everybody could solve this problem you
just have to tell us who you are
it's the most non-problem ever existed
in the world
a self-solving problem all you have to
do is
complain about it and it's solved
can you think of anything else where the
only thing you have to do is complain
publicly and it gets solved
yeah so obviously nobody's looking to
solve the problem
i think that's clear i am
coming around to the opinion that the
protesters
who are protesting from everything about
uh george floyd to
duante wright whose name i always
mispronounce
i don't do it intentionally
and i'm coming around to that opinion
that there has to be a better way to
handle this
because as soon as soon as a
confrontation starts
you you've ramped up the odds of
something bad happening
you know right through the roof is there
a way
to let's say deny them
digital access to the world let's say
you know who it is
so let's say your minimum requirement is
you know who the perpetrator is
and maybe they're in a car and they're
running away or they get away
but you can id them either because you
got a photograph
and you have let's say facial
recognition or something
took the maybe you looked at the license
plate and it was the real person
so if the police know who the person is
or have a way to identify the person
let's say the driver of a car
or somebody else who they catch but then
that person runs away
isn't there a better way a non-violent
way
to punish them from a distance
in other words just put like a a digital
tag on them so that anytime they try to
sign up for snapchat they can't do it
i'm just i'm just brainstorming here
that might not be a good example
because everybody needs to live in the
digital world
they need to eventually have banking
they need to
you know sign up for instagram right
and for all these things you need to say
what your name is ideally
so it feels to me that there's something
we could do
by let's say limiting somebody's digital
life until until they just surrender
until they just surrender now that might
there might be a part two to this which
is you have to lower maybe the
the penalties so there might be some
things
which somebody would get arrested for
that maybe we just
should minimize it a little bit so i'd
look at that as well
but i am not completely unsympathetic
and i know some of you are to the idea
that
we could defund the police now it would
be crazy
to just defund the police if you didn't
have some substitute
system you thought had a chance of
making a difference
but if you took a long-term look at it
and said what could you do to make
police not necessary
let me throw out another idea instead
of letting all the peace people with
criminal records
live among the people who do not suppose
once you get a criminal record
you just have to live in the place with
all the people with criminal records
sort of like a you know a prisoner
island situation
could that group of people where all the
prisoner or not the prisoners the
the people who have some kind of
criminal record
they could just live with themselves
with no police let them come up with
their own rules
if it's better is better now somebody's
saying prison but i'm talking about
somebody who's already paid their debt
they just have a let's say they have a
violent criminal record
the odds of people being a repeat
offender are pretty high
if you've never had a criminal record
your odds are low that you'll get one
after a certain age right so
i feel as if there's there's a
segment of the population that doesn't
want to live
in the same place as police live because
they're
natural enemies somebody is not going to
stop committing crimes
the police are not going to stop busting
them for it
so they just shouldn't be in the same
place just let the people who want to be
criminals live live with other criminals
now i'm not saying that's a good idea
right if you're saying to yourself
that's a bad idea
you know uh liberty constitution those
are all good
good counterpoints i'm just saying that
i feel as if there's a level of
creativity we could apply to this
that hasn't been applied i'm just saying
let's be creative and see what we can do
and test some things you never know
suppose you took one of these people who
had a criminal record
and again this has nothing to do with
race in case you're
in case you're imagining that this is a
non-racial thing
you just say here's your here's your
deal if you live among
the people that want police you're going
to get stopped by the police you're
going to have
you're going to get arrested you're
going back to jail but we'll give you
the option
you could live in a non-police city
you'll probably be killed by the people
who are also criminals living there
but if you want it's your option to have
no police
so it'd have to be optional i think that
would be the the main point
um all right so here's some reframings
i'm going to give you some several
examples of how to take
things that are in the news and just
look at them differently
just by reframing them number one
there's a doctor who's got lots of
credentials in her
bio so some doctor celine grant gounder
was talking about nae silvers i guess
nae silver had tweeted about
some things about the coronavirus etc
and she tweets with all due respect to
nate silver he is not an expert on the
psychology of vaccine confidence
he is a pole aggregator and a political
pundit
he is not an infectious disease
specialist epidemiologist
vaccinologist virologist immunologist or
behavioral scientist so there
do you know who else is not those things
everybody i think
i think she just described everybody in
earth
there's nobody who has all these things
so should
everybody just shut up unless they have
mastered all these domains
well let me reframe this the way james
uh sarah wike
sir week sir wiki did in a
responding tweet he said it is
ridiculous to say nae sulfur is not
qualified to speak
about how a government action might
shape public opinion
or on the types of messaging around
issues of risk and reward they're likely
to be effective
and as james says that is his lane
the the people who know risk management
are the only people who should be
talking
let me say that again nate silver
is one of the few people in the world
who has earned the right to talk about
anything
because he can do math he understands
risk
management and puts things in that
context consistently
he has a good you know track record of
you know showing him he's mastered his
his uh field
i would say that anybody who has any of
these things
like a disease specialist a virologist
immunologist any of those people they
should shut up
and they should talk to nate silver i'm
not serious but
to make the point they should talk to
him and then all the other people should
talk to nay silver
and then they silver should tell us what
the risk management looks like
once he's collected the opinions of the
experts
now that's what a leader does right a
leader who knows risk management does
a bad leader would not you know they
would just take the political
route but this framing
of nate silver as exactly the wrong
person to be talking about it
is completely upside down he's the only
person i would listen to
if i had a choice because he understands
risk management
all of these experts they kind of know
what they read from other experts
and if they can sum up their opinions i
do want a naysilver to tell me what to
think about it now i'll make up my own
opinion obviously
but i want the risk management of people
to be talking
i don't want some freaking siloed
immunologist
person who doesn't understand anything
except their field
i don't care about that so the reframing
here is that the risk management people
are the only people who should be
talking in public
because if you can't frame things in
terms of risk management
you are doing propaganda
risk management is the opposite of
propaganda
anything that leaves it down is
either by intention or design or
accident propaganda
so
there's your first reframing all right
here's another one
on the issue of voter ids is voter id
racist
well this is a reframing from you should
know because the story requires it a
black man
who is mark keith robinson lieutenant
governor of north carolina
now because he's black he gets to say
this you know you and i maybe can't
depending depending on what color you
are i mean he says quote
i categorically reject the notion that a
people who are strong enough to survive
and overcome the horrors of slavery
and the violent bigotry of jim crow are
now too weak
to obtain a free id to protect the
integrity of their vote
that's really good as reframings go
this is as good as you get so mark keith
robinson i don't know anything about him
except he's a lieutenant governor but if
this is the kind of game he can bring to
other topics
maybe we're going to see more of mark
keith robinson
because i would like to see more of this
you know that
if i could you know safely extrapolate
from one opinion
this is a good reframe and what did i
tell you is the uh
the important thing here is that
responsibility is the person's not
not societies to fix you and he framed
that perfectly
that you're basically calling black
people
what if if the one thing they can't do
is get an id
which everybody can do it feels it feels
racist
right feels racist to me to say that
black people
can't figure out how to get id's i don't
know how you can see it any other way
but racist all right
i told you about the resisting arrest
epidemic as opposed to the
police killing people epidemic that's a
better reframe and accurate too
the thing with the reframe is i don't
try to sell you any reframe
that doesn't make things more clear like
i'm not going to reframe things to make
them more
propaganda unless i'm doing it for fun
but yeah i guess sometimes i might do
that
to to influence i guess you call that
propaganda
so i'll take that back i think probably
sometimes i do
reframe for influence but i never do it
for
bad intentions right it's usually to
make things clear not the opposite
uh we know now from james o'keefe
and his under his secret videos he's got
if you haven't seen this
you got to see this you have to see the
the newest video from
project veritas and you probably are
only going to be able to see it on their
website
so because i think it's probably
suppressed everywhere else
but they got a technical director at cnn
on camera saying that first of all he
admitted that the network
engaged in propaganda he actually used
that word
to remove trump from presidency and he
said quote our focus was to get trump
out of office
and he said i came to cnn because i
wanted to be part of that
so actual cnn employee
who's a technical director so that must
be you know at least a
fairly management kind of a job
and he's saying it directly
and he's not it's on twitter somebody's
saying so so just
just google james o'keefe and cnn
propaganda it'll probably pop up
and then more of it talked about how
they were planning to
after the pandemic's over cnn was going
to shift its focus to scaring you about
climate change
and then today we see that the word
climate
the words climate emergency are going to
be used by some other media
they're saying well we're going to call
it a climate emergency from now on
as opposed to climate change
is that propaganda
yes it is because if you change the word
so that the the word itself is a message
you've left out the reasons if you give
me the reasons that's an argument but if
you try to pack the reasons into a word
and you're trying to get me to just
accept the word
independent of the reasons that went
into it
it's kind of an end run around reason
isn't it
so i'm going to call that a reframe
that's a
potentially bad one now if you think
that the climate is an emergency
you would say this is a good reframe
because it gets people to be more
serious
about something that's serious so this
one's more of a
an opinion one but there's no doubt that
it's uh
propaganda you just don't know if it's
productive propaganda
because there's good propaganda and bad
right
we're all we're all brainwashed all the
time some of it's good for us
some of us not
um how about critical race theory i was
reading an article from a
teacher who's at a private school who
got in trouble for criticizing critical
race theory
and um when you hear about
you hear about the details of it it's
basically just racism
not even just basically it's just racism
so they're actually
teaching kids to be racists under the
guise of doing the opposite
and i don't think that's an unfair
characterization
because um the details of it are that
you're supposed to see each other in
terms of your race
and and act that way somehow
um and that is racism
that's not i'm not just using hyperbole
that is literally the definition of
racism
treating people differently based on
race now of course they would say they
have good intentions
but do you care do you care that they
have good intentions
when it's still just racism i think you
shouldn't care about that
because racism with good intentions
is nazi germany because the nazis had
good intentions
for the nazis they just had bad
intentions for other people
or didn't care here's
how i would reframe critical race theory
i would call it
state mandated racism so critical race
theory
looks to replace this would be it's an
you know stated intention
individual races racism in students
they're replacing individual racism
with state mandated racism because this
crt stuff is
sort of mandated at this point how's
that reframe
it's state mandated racism and it's
completely supportable by their own
description of what it is
you don't even have to change the
description just just say here's what
they say it is
this is them telling you what it is
state sponsored
racism now i don't think that's a
an effective reframe but it's an
accurate one
um here's some more i think critical
race theory causes brain damage
not not hyperbole
not an exaggeration not speaking
figuratively
i think it literally causes brain damage
now of course we've as we get smarter
about what brains are and how brains
work
everything is brain damage if it's not
good for you
uh right so so yeah pretty much your
cell phone and everything else is
causing brain damage
uh but i think this is and here's
specifically why it's
it's teaching kids a form of learned
helplessness
and that is number one child abuse
in my opinion i think it's child abuse
to say that your problems are caused by
other people
and that your success will be limited by
the opinions of other people
is it true totally it's totally true
your success will be influenced by
racism
mine was i told you i lost two careers
three really three careers to racism so
yeah racism really does affect you
but if you teach the kids that message
that they're victims of it as opposed to
agents of their own
their own life you know that they have
control of their life
they have problems in life racism is one
of them it's a big one
but they have strategies where they can
slice through it like a hop
poker through butter if they use the
right strategies
now compare these two messages your life
will be determined by racism which i
think critical race theory is telling
them
versus there are a lot of problems in
the world but we're going to teach you
how to get over them
one of them is good for your brain and
your life and the other gives you brain
damage
telling people that they're helpless to
racism i think
is brain damage and a form of child
abuse
and that's my real opinion by the way in
case you're wondering if i'm just trying
to make an argument or something
that's a genuine real opinion that it
causes brain damage
here's another reframe we have lots of
fact checkers in the world
and i appreciate them even when i
disagree with them i do think it's
really useful
that there are fact checking
organizations even when
so many times i think they get it wrong
it's better that they exist than not
and if you have more than one
fact-checking organization you have a
little bit of hope
that one of them will get it right and
you can spot that
but here's what we really need
propaganda checkers
that's what we need we need propaganda
checkers
i'm going to pause for a moment because
something just happened in your head
didn't it
when i said that you just said to
yourself
holy we could do that
completely doable it's just a website
with calling out what is propaganda
and what is objective it's easy
somebody just look at the headlines say
oh that one's propaganda now it'd have
to be somebody with some credentials
much like the fact checkers require
people who are good at researching and
fact
checking so there are people who are
good at propaganda spotting
me for example i could do i could do a
propaganda checking
website if i had nothing else to do just
start a website
take each headline say okay they used
this word that's propaganda
now remember propaganda doesn't mean
bad for you it just means they're not
trying to let you make up your own mind
all right let me give you an example of
propaganda that's good for you
patriotism patriotism
pledge of allegiance it's propaganda
this brainwashing just happens to be
good for the country
to get everybody on the same side
especially children so we do brainwash
children
like crazy it just happens to be better
than not
so i wouldn't even say that the
propaganda is always bad
but you should call it out and say what
it is
now isn't all communications propaganda
no
no it is not you can make an argument
that everything has you know two percent
of propaganda in it
i could see that but the the difference
in level
is so extreme that that's worth calling
out
but you are right that once it gets down
to the the more subtle cases
it's sort of an opinion all right
but certainly the cnn moving from
climate change
to climate emergency assuming that's
what they go to
looks like the mainstream is going to go
to that that's propaganda
but if i were the propaganda checker i
would say okay this is propaganda
but it might be good for you if the
right
right if they're right about climate
change and how dangerous it is
calling it an emergency is good for you
right
so propaganda doesn't mean it's bad for
you that's i guess i said that too many
times
all right here's another here's another
one
um
all right well never mind that i'm gonna
skip this one so it looks like
putin and biden are in a manly manned
dick measuring contest
and i guess putin warned
biden against putting any warships you
know anywhere near the ukraine
situation where i guess russia has
amassed forces on the border of ukraine
and we all expect them to invade and
conquer and hold the russian the russian
language
portion of that area cremate crimea and
ukraine
it looks like russia is just going to
grab it and keep it
and he warned biden to keep his warships
out for your own good
for their own good and biden came back
and says uh
he uh he warned uh putin that he should
you know stay cool for his own good
so now they've both given each other a
mafia-like warning
it's like you might want to stay out of
this area
for your own good now what was the
was that useful if this were trump
would this be happening do you think
that
putin would be acting the same if trump
were president
because remember everybody said trump's
best friends with putin right
so wouldn't putin do the same thing
because he wouldn't be worried about
trump
because they're best friends according
to the mainstream media
but trump had one thing that was sort of
a superpower wasn't it
you could not predict what the hell that
guy was going to do
you couldn't predict what about biden
is biden predictable yes he is
did trump tell us that being
unpredictable would be like a
an extra power yes he did
often did we see it in practice
yes we did because he acted
unpredictably
he dropped a mother of all bombs he
bombed that syrian airport
even though there were russian troops
there he simply made sure you knew
that you didn't know what the hell he
was going to do next which is really
really scary right
biden is not scary because you do think
he's going to warn you
and you do think he's going to act
predictable what happens when somebody
who's a chess player like putin
is presented with an unpredictable
situation
he waits until it's predictable what
happens when he's presented with a
predictable situation
well then it's chess time and who's
going to be better at chess
you know i would say that putin has the
home field advantage over there
i feel like he wins a chess he wouldn't
win
if if he had to hold off and wait for
things to clarify
and that's that was what trump offered i
think
all right um if you were to predict
where this is going to go i have a sort
of a general question
is it possible for a superpower to deter
any other superpower if the superpower
is going after a smaller nation
and i think not i think that if you had
to
guess what the future looks like it will
be
china does own taiwan
eventually russia does own
the russians speaking at least portions
of
ukraine eventually there's nothing that
can stop them
because i don't see that the superpower
is going to go to war
over another country
i just don't and it seems to me that the
superpowers will probably
just consolidate control over
neighboring countries just for
security reasons now here's my question
why is it that russia wants to control
this part of the world
what's in it for russia to conquer and
hold territory in ukraine
now of course the the story is that
they're russian-speaking people who just
want to be conquered
and be part of russia nobody really
believes that
right nobody believes that it's about
you know nationalism or russian speaking
or anything that's just
sort of the story somebody says gas
lines but i don't think so because that
would just be one little part of the
world
you know you'd still need to get your
gas line to where you needed to go
access to the black sea but not the
parts that they're trying to conquer
right do you think that they're just
going to try to conquer stuff till they
get to the ocean
so here's here's what i'm wondering
why do we why does anybody want to
deny russia the ability to a
defend themselves they have nuclear
weapons
so helping them defend themselves a
little bit better
doesn't seem like it would make any
difference to the united states
does it because we could destroy russia
a thousand times over with nukes
so if they're a little bit more secure
let's say they conquered some
buffer territory do we care
i i feel as if we could make
some places less conquerable by simply
not being a threat and i just don't even
know what
putin gets from conquering this little
bit of real estate
and i don't think i'll ever find it in
the news so maybe
if anybody knows let me know i mean i
see your guesses
but here's my larger point i believe
that the way trump
got what i would call a good result in
north korea
is that he took away the reason for
north korea to be at war with the united
states
he just took away the reason
why can't we do that with ukraine taiwan
etc can't we take away the reason
i feel like we could now in the case of
china and
and taiwan or whatever the real name is
for taiwan
in that case i think there's a sort of a
national
[Music]
ego involved so maybe there's nothing
you can do about that one
but i do think that the superpowers
should not be
conquering countries for their own
safety
like if that's really the reason that
shouldn't be a thing
and i don't think that anything should
stop any country from
producing gas or or anything in a
competitive environment so long as we're
not victims of it
in a monopoly sense all right let's talk
about
uh there's a rasmussen
poll results they asked this question
how likely is it that cheating affected
the outcome of the 2020
presidential election now you know that
this is going to be by party lines right
so they added together the people who
said it's very likely
that cheating affected the race and the
somewhat likelies
for a for a total likely democrats
uh 30 percent of them 30 percent
of democrats were willing to say that
it's at least somewhat likely that the
election
was changed by cheating
30 that's way more than i thought
um then unaffiliated about half of them
and republicans as you might expect 74
of them now again you get this 74
thing and i always ask who's the other
25
who are these people and i have a
hypothesis that 25 percent
will uh interpret a poll in a
question a polling question differently
than the other 75 percent
somewhat consistently so the question
was
uh do you feel the the cheating effect
of the outcome
who are the 25 of republicans who think
no
it's hard to be a republican and think
no um
but of all voters 51 now if 51
of voters especially if a third of them
democrats
think that there's this high chance of
something
shouldn't we be working a little bit
harder for transparency on the next one
and you don't really see it do you i see
no effort
by anybody to make the next election
more transparent
or even to have a full audit of what we
have
so that's something um
so there's a website that purports to
collect all the
studies of various chemicals that were
used for early treatment
of uh covent and
this website is not what i would call a
credible website
but i'll just alert you to it anyway it
says c19 the letter c
19 early dot com in case you want to
take a look at it
c letter c one nine early dot com
and what they did is take all the
different studies of the various
chemicals that have been tried and took
an
average of how much they helped based on
those studies
now number one can you take an average
of studies
is that something you can really do well
i'm not
statistically competent enough to say
when that can be done
because there are times you do meta
studies and you do exactly that
and people do consider that useful but
there have to be other times
when just grabbing a bunch of things
that studied things differently
and taking an average might not be the
best thing to do so i don't know if it
is in this case
but let me tell you the results that
they
they got when they sort of averaged the
studies
multiple studies at the top of the list
the thing that helped the most if you
got it early
91 improvement i guess again this is
low credibility reporting here so don't
take any of this is true
is something called the proxy ludamide
so of all the things from vitamin d to
zinc to hydroxychloroquine to rendezvire
ivermectin they're all in the list and
i'll mention them in a minute
but the number one one is one i've never
heard of
have you heard of this one i assume if
you're a medical doctor you know what it
is
but i've never heard of peroximide
is it true that it's 91 percent
effective if you get it early
what the hell is it here's number two
bromhexine what and apparently that's
like
you know hugely effective according to
this non-credible
uh grouping of studies
number three providing iodine
what what the hell is it yeah and you
have to get to number four before you
get one you've even heard of ivermectin
now this claims a 76 improvement who
knows
then you go further down the list there
are a number of chemicals and you get
down to
62 percent effect in this and again i'm
not saying any of this is credible
i'm just reporting what is reported the
vitamin d is 62
effective i have a real question on that
because i think
probably the studies only showed that
people with vitamin d
had better outcomes i don't think you
showed that if you
gave them vitamin d you know like just a
pill a regular pill of vitamin d i don't
think that's what anybody studied
but i could be wrong uh and then
we get down toward lower on the list
zinc
allegedly 37 effective
hydroxychloroquine
allegedly 26 effective and at the very
bottom
rum deserver oh and vitamin c i guess is
even lower
but rem deserve basically 26
now don't believe any of these numbers
but
the question i ask is if zinc is 37
by itself and hydroxychloride is 26
by itself and vitamin d is 62 percent
by itself what happens if you take all
three or what happens if you take any
combination of these
that work on different mechanisms you
know you wouldn't you'd have to be
careful what your combination was i
guess
but i feel like there's some combination
of these
you know if science studied them
maybe they'd find out that makes a
difference
who knows
um oh somebody says brett weinstein said
he would take ivormectin
based on his own looking and reading of
the research now he would be more
qualified than most people to
read research and make a decision but
again
people are going to have different
opinions so
none of these drugs make anybody much
money except room deserver that we heard
a lot about
but it doesn't seem that effective for
the early use might be better for late
lose use
here's a interesting little thing for
you to try
um well in a moment oh let's do this
so uh luke rodkowski points out
try searching for the term riots today
just two words search for riots today
and then use two different search
engines one duckduckgo
and then do the same search on google do
you think you'll get a different result
well as you might expect the word riot
if you do it on google gets soft into
protest
if there are left leaning events
and it gets turned into riot just like
the search term
if it's a right leaning event and once
you see it side by side
you would think well a search engine is
just going to look for words right
it's not doing any thinking it's just a
search engine
so they should be very similar nope
one scrubs the word riot and turns it
into protest
and one keeps riot as riot
and when you see it side by side it's
just shocking
um there's a story that the
capital police they have this agency's
civil disturbance unit so
they specialize in handling the large
group of protesters and apparently they
were not allowed to use their most
powerful tools and techniques
against the crowd that
marched on the capitol now
is that a story because don't you think
it was probably
a good decision not to use their most
powerful tools and techniques because
when we're talking about all these
police actions and people dying in
you know for being stopped for warrants
and stuff they shouldn't
end in your death but
the the call is to um to get the police
to be less violent
isn't this the right thing i feel as if
that was the right decision
to not use their most effective tools
because i do think it's better
that the crowd got a little you know
they got farther than they should have
but probably those the the
officials may have played it right
because the perfect
mix is that they don't get to the you
know they don't get to the actual
politicians
and there was somebody willing to shoot
somebody to stop that from happening
i think they would have shot more people
if anybody had been closer to the actual
elected professionals
at the same time there could have been a
greater loss of life
if this civil disturbance unit had been
authorized
to use more dangerous methods
so i feel like it's a weird story that
they're reporting on a complete failure
but i'm looking at all the same details
and i see a success
like a really good one because
i feel like the the least harmful thing
to do would be to let them in
to the unoccupied parts keep the
temperature down
which is what the professionals did and
and have a uh not screwing around
wall between the protesters
and the actual people they're protecting
so i'm in favor of the guy who shot
the the woman who came through the the
window i don't think he should be
charged
because if you're going to take this
agency's civil disturbance unit and tell
them they can't use
you know the the more aggressive things
that does mean you have made a decision
to let that crowd get right up to the
elected professionals
and if the guy who did the shooting was
felt he was sort of the last line
between
the elected officials and the protesters
that was a good shoot
somebody says no warning shot
um that's a fair statement that's a fair
statement
but i don't know if he had time because
if she'd gotten through
i don't know the warning shot could have
helped much
so but i think that was a judgment call
i mean you don't always have time for a
warning shot
he probably yelled a warning and it's
not like anybody didn't know this was
dangerous right
did you have to know that you could get
shot if you break through a window in
the capitol
who didn't know that all right let's
talk about propaganda
um here's more on the matt gates story
now what's interesting about this story
is that as time goes by
there have been many allegations but
they all have the same quality
they're not supported and
the longer we go without any of these
allegations being
supported by something that you and i
can actually see
and we know the details of it's
it's disturbing now remember i
i defend the process and the system when
it's worth defending
i don't defend the people so matt gates
is on his own
he has to be on his own to defend
himself that's not my job
like i don't want to defend him you can
if you want but i don't want to
but we should talk about the system
so there's a story today one of the big
publications i don't know who it was
new york times or somebody uh so
somebody's reporting that they saw him
at a party
in which there were uh women there they
were all
legal age as far as anybody could tell
no no report
of him being at any kind of an event
with anybody under 18.
and somebody reported and it made it
into a story
that somebody saw him taking pills that
could have been
recreational is that fair
that's actually reported in the news
that somebody saw him take some pills
that somebody else thought might have
been recreational
i don't feel like that should be in a
story
might have been do you know what kind of
pills might have been something else all
of them
that's every pill
there's no evidence that he directly
paid anyone for sex
but there's all this suspicion you know
there's the other guy who might have
there might have been money for travel
in hotels but is that paying for sex i
don't know
um then there's a suggestion that
matt gates might have been provided
women
by you know whoever might be trying to
influence him or blackmail him
to which i say can't matt gates get as
many women as he wanted i mean he's
engaged now but does anybody suggest
that matt gates had trouble getting
women
and that he would be influenced because
somebody
you know got him a hooker if that ever
happened there's no evidence that that
happened
that that looks good
so i'm not sure any of this quite
quite reaches the level at which we
should be reporting it
now if any of these things get confirmed
i suppose that's worth reporting
but it's just so creepy
that it's it's if he did this and he
might have done this and
could have done this that's just
everybody
everybody could have taken a drug and
maybe they did
everybody might have done something bad
but we'd like to see some evidence
um and i would also add like this so the
big the big conversation
about the matt gates story is whether
money was ever involved in his
relationships with women
to which i say it's always involved
money's never not involved in
relationships in the specific case
where one person has a lot of it or more
of it
and one person doesn't have much and the
reporting is
that these were relationships with gates
who had money
and women who were younger especially
and did not
there are no there are no situations
where a man with a lot of money
gets into any kind of conduct
with a woman who has none or little and
there isn't a transfer of money
for something it's it's just the most
universal
mechanism in the world now
somebody says gold diggers
so who doesn't like money
raise your hands if you don't like money
i i to me it just seems the most
biologically normal thing in the world
that people who have money share it with
people who don't and that there's a
reciprocal
benefit in that so just the fact that
we're talking about it it's just weird
it's like we don't even understand how
life works all right
there's more news about cue believers
and how to reprogram them
apparently there's there's an effort to
try to reprogram the cue believers
and one of the things that the experts
say doesn't work
is to tell them that they're stupid and
wrong
you could have talked to me i think i
could have told you
that you don't really change people's
mind by telling them they're stupid and
wrong
you could try has never worked in the
history of the world
so the question is um
what makes q so sticky and how do you
deprogram them if you think you should i
would like to add one thing to the
what makes it sticky and this is an
observation i made when the internet was
brand new
when the internet was new the the
guiding assumption was
that this would be a way to push
information
to people who wanted information and i
said
early on that's not how people work yeah
i mean there will be plenty of that
information that people want they'll get
it from the internet
but i said early on because to me as a
student of persuasion and the mind
that the far larger effect would be
giving people a way to talk
so that the internet is driven only
mostly
by talking and not listening listening
is real good
listening meaning your research you get
some information right
so it's very good for that but that's
not what drives it that's not
the passionate part that's not the part
that makes you sign on every day
the part that does that is you being
heard
so you being heard is really really
powerful
you being somebody who consumes
information is just
a passive process so the thing that q
did
accidentally right or was it accidental
we don't know
but it would be quite amazing if
somebody had figured this out in advance
but what it did was it empowered
everybody to be a little bit of a star
so it also had the lottery effect to it
the lottery effect is well it's not
likely but i could hit the lottery
in this case if you were a cue
researcher
it wasn't likely that you were going to
be the one who who
finally put all the pieces together and
solved the big conspiracy
and and outed the deep state but it was
possible
you could you might be the one who who
finally put the pieces together
other people were doing it it looked
like they were making some progress or
at least as far as you could tell
and so you thought maybe i could so it's
not just that i could be heard
but i could change the world have i told
you it's actually in
i think one or two of my books mentions
this point
now one of the tricks i do to keep
myself
interested in life and keep my energy up
is i always have at least one usually
more
at least one project that could change
the world
now the odds of me doing anything that
changes the world
are low right but
even though the odds are low the
potential benefit
is so large that it's still motivating
and some of you know the story about
telehealth over over state lines i was
part of making that happen
so there have been cases where i have
changed the world
objectively you what you watched it with
your own eyes
you saw me suggest telehealth be allowed
over state lines during the pandemic
you saw the president get the idea you
saw him do an executive order
and now telehealth is everywhere so it
is not
crazy to think that one person can come
up with the thing that put the parts
together
it does happen and people have seen
plenty of examples of it
greta tunberg perfect example of one
person who can make a difference
so q has that going for it it had that
going for it
so um that's pretty powerful
um it also q also has the
the wonderful benefit of making you
belong to something
that seems important no matter how weird
you
are right q
was the most um what would be the word
certainly anti-racist but the least
bigoted
least discriminatory process of all time
was there anybody who said you can't be
in q if you're black
no no
was there anybody who said he can't be
in queue if you're a woman
no can you not be in queue if you're if
you lean left
nope nope you could be in queue
no matter how weird you were and you
could be sure
that nobody else in queue would call you
out for being weird
i mean i'm sure it happened on message
boards and stuff but it would be trivial
you could be as weird as you wanted and
i use weird in a good way
all right so when i say weird that's not
a negative
because i like to be weird too right so
different
let's just say different so q really had
the whole package it had mystery
had something you could do have i told
you that if somebody can get you to
physically do something it binds you to
them
so that's why when i would do a
presentation back in my corporate days
i would hand down tic tacs or i would
ask a question that caused them to raise
their hands
because the first thing you want to do
if you're trying to influence people is
get
them to do something physically
and q got them to do their own research
so if you were to study you know
persuasion and what moves people
q had the whole package
i mean q didn't leave anything on the
table
accidentally i think like i don't i
don't think somebody thought this up in
advance and said
if we put together these elements it'll
be the strongest thing anybody's ever
seen
but they did end up that way it ended up
that way
um here's another benefit q gives you
the illusion of understanding the world
for the first time how exciting is it
to think that you had finally understood
the world really exciting that's a
pretty big payoff
and q offered that somebody uh
coined the phrase conspiratuality
meaning the q filled some need that
people just automatically biologically
have
for something like spiritualism or
something like a religion
and that the thought is the cue sort of
felt that for some people
i'm a little less persuaded by that
because i think most of these people had
a religion
uh already um
here's a question for you wouldn't it be
easy to deprogram
q if the major media kept a running list
of all the predictions and then reported
the outcomes as they happened
wouldn't that take care of it now in the
beginning
you could argue oh we're not sure if the
predictions are panning out or not
but we think they look good but at this
point
you could just list all of the q
predictions
and you could just fact check them and
then every time there was a q supporter
you say hey here's a link boom go to the
go to here
now i do believe that individuals have
made these lists
people trying to argue with other people
online but
has cnn ever presented the
the daniel dale fact-checked list
of every q prediction and every result
wouldn't that be obvious because cnn
would like to deprogram q
and the biggest reason is because it's
not accurate
and they have they've got a they've got
a fact checker
he's on he's on the payroll he could
probably work through that cue stuff in
one afternoon and then it would be a
permanent page
and every person who had a cue addiction
you just send them to the page and you
just step out of it
because like i said calling people
stupid or misinformed never works
people have to talk themselves out of
this sort of thing
you just need to give them time and and
space to do it
so you just say you know you follow q
q's made a lot of predictions how'd they
do
and then just step out that's all
but you do not see cnn or any of the
mainstream media
doing that list to try to program the q
people do you know why
probably because they don't want to
i think the only reason is they don't
want to debug it
debunk it or let me say it better they
don't want to debunk it
effectively the best place for cnn to be
profit-wise is to debunk it in a way
that all of their viewers
think is pretty persuasive but would
have no effect on it
on it you know staying or going cnn
could just put q out of business
i said they just report what their
predictions were that's it
it's out of business but they won't do
it you'll never see that
all right
if the vaccine the the johnson johnson
vaccine has a risk for younger women
which we're still looking into there's
some indication it might
why'd they stop giving it to men
is there something we don't know
and it's a serious question right
if the only adverse effects were 100
women why did you stop giving it to ben
now the i think the nate silver point
was that if you added all the adverse
risks together
it's still so small that you're way
better off getting the vaccination
but forget about that
we have as far as i know no indication
that men
are in any way affected why don't you
just give it to the men
that frees up other vaccinations for the
women
the ones that don't seem to have this
problem
right just give it to men
unless there's something they know about
it that we don't know so i'd worry about
that did you see the headline that
former bachelor
lead colton underwood he had some
personal news he needed to share with
the world
did you see that story and
this is a big surprise but the personal
news is that the guy who was on the
bachelor
uh came out as gay now i would like to
ask
a provocative question i will preface
this provocative
question with the following
if you've been watching me for a while
you know that i'm a great supporter of
the lgbtq community especially
transgender folks and so everything i
say from this point on
is meant with respect okay
because it could easily be
misinterpreted so now that i've
staged you a little bit can anybody tell
me why gay people look gay
is that confirmation bias because
i saw this story and i'm actually just
asking because
confirmation bias is so powerful that
when i saw this story
and i saw a photo of uh colton underwood
and he had teased that he was later
going to tell us what his personal
secret was
i looked at the picture and said
he's obviously gay and then he came out
as gay
was there anybody who looked at his
picture after you this is the important
part
after you'd heard that he was gonna come
out with some personal news he kind of
knew it was gonna be gay right
you didn't have to be a genius to figure
that out but when you looked at his
picture
once you've been primed with that
thought that he was going to come out as
gay
didn't he look gay right
is it just me and again this is with
complete respect
complete respect there's no disrespect
in any of this
interrogation but you know the the gay
population has been saying forever and
i think science backs them that it's not
a lifestyle choice
you're kind of born you're born gay
which i completely accept as true
now if you're born gay could it ever
show up in your face
like could you because i i think they've
actually tested
the the so-called gaydar and i believe
that gay men
can actually detect just from the face
uh people who are more likely to be gay
i think that's a real thing
right somebody says unproven and i'll
take your
note as valuable there yeah i don't know
that the science has
determined that for sure but here's the
question
is it confirmation bias because i've
seen this guy
uh colton um underwood a bunch of times
i've seen him in the context of the
bachelor not once
when i saw him in his previous context
not once
did my mind say oh he looks gay why is
he under the bachelor
not once but the moment he teased it
he totally looked gay to me did that
happen to you
i'm just wondering if you had the same
experience and again it's all with
complete respect it's just a curiosity i
have
all right i'll look for your your
comments
um so tucker carlson's uh getting in
trouble
you know from cnn and all of his enemies
for using the word
replacement because apparently that's a
word that is used by
anti-semitic people and
people who think that brown people will
will replace white people in the united
states but tucker has been using the
word
replacement as in you know replacing
people who are here and i'm a little bit
undecided on this
so i'm going to work through this in
public okay
one of the things we like about tucker
is that he won't
bow to the the woke crowd right it's
the best thing about him i mean his show
is terrific
but you know if you're to name one thing
is that he seems unusually resistant
to being forced to talk the way he he's
being told to talk or use the words that
he has to use or anything
so when he uses the word replacement he
doesn't
cage it in this theory that the racists
do is is more of a just descriptive
that if the country is a certain
character and people like it that way
and you bring in anybody from anywhere
else it doesn't matter their ethnicity
doesn't matter you know the people want
to make it about that
but if you bring in any other population
as a different culture
different preferences priorities
different anything
it's going to change what you got and in
a political sense
the people who are here will have less
voting
power because there'll be fewer of them
compared to new people coming in
and if somebody wants to say that's a
replacement
and i have to think that tucker is aware
that that
that specific word is triggering so
here's where i'm
here's where i'm on the fence on this so
help me walk help me through this okay
on one hand as a communicator myself
i would never use a word that i knew
would be a distraction
because you you know tucker is trying to
make a point but then his point is
completely lost
because he used that word so if you're
just trying to be a good communicator
would you use that word if you knew it
was it was going to cause all the
all the attention to be sucked out of
your point and brought to
a whole different point or
do we appreciate and praise tucker
because can i have permission to swear
everybody can i give you a little
warning
there's there's an f-bomb coming up hide
the children
put your muffs on the pets
if tucker carlson is told you can't use
the common word
replacement and tucker carlson is saying
in effect you i kind of like that
don't you i mean i like i like the fact
there's somebody taking a stand
that i'm going to use words as words
and you can't tell me not to use these
words i wouldn't do it
in other words that's not the way i
would play it because i would put more
value on
communicating without distracting but i
like that there are people who do
right i'm always i'm always in favor of
what i would call
a creative tension it's good to have
people on both sides of
everything it really is because that's
how you test each other
and having tucker on the other side of
this
can i use this word or can i not i think
it's valuable
even though i wouldn't do it and even
though i think he's drawing more
drawing more criticism than he needs
really
somebody says as uh well i don't know if
he's using it for shock value
and i don't know and we don't know what
he's thinking but i'm just glad he
exists
as a pushback although i would not play
it the same way myself
all right um
according to rasmussen they they asked
about whether uh they find that 29
percent of likely u.s voters
say laws requiring photo identification
at the polls
discriminate against some voters so
almost 30 percent say the required id
discriminates 62 percent
say voter id laws don't discriminate
here's my problem with this question
so this is a rasmussen poll my question
is
don't people define discriminate
differently
because how could you you can't really
argue that it changes the racial outcome
do you is there anybody who's consuming
news
who doesn't know that if you institute
voter id it will change the number of
people who vote by ethnicity
i thought everybody knew that and isn't
that discrimination
so here's the here's the tough part it's
discrimination by a fact
i don't think that's even even in
conversation is it i believe both the
democrats and the republicans are firmly
in the same camp
that there will be fewer black voters if
you make this change
and that's why the democrats are arguing
and that's why the republicans want to
do it
because they're both on the same side
that it will have a racial outcome
which republicans think will will favor
them so
that just begs the question of how did
you define discriminate
because if you ask me does it
discriminate i would say
of course it does but you have to do it
anyway
do you know what else discriminates
everything
everything we we don't stop doing
everything because it all has a racial
outcome
because it does that's total racial
outcomes
gender outcomes everything we do
discriminates
so if you ask me does this discriminate
i'd say well yeah it does
but we have to do it because the reason
for doing it is better than the
discrimination
that's why anything happens do you know
who discriminates
terribly the the military
try getting in the military if you're
out of shape or
you know you have a weight problem or
you know you're blind you've got a
disability
you're a woman and you want to be in
certain parts of the military
the military is the most discriminating
thing in the world
but we allow it because we think the you
know
getting the most effective killing force
is more important than all
of those those other issues so
i worry about a question that says does
something discriminate because i think
just people are looking at it
differently
that is my show for today
or you're old somebody says i don't know
what that means
um somebody says dismiss
malcolm nance your thinking is suspect
uh nobody takes malcolm nancy seriously
do they
i didn't think i didn't think there was
anybody left who thought he was a
uh a credible player about anything
he he sort of like uh his record is sort
of cue-like i think
um isn't there something like practical
discrimination
yeah you don't even need words for it
discrimination is just universal
there's no big policy or a public thing
you can do that doesn't
um doesn't have a disproportionate
effect on somebody
you know taxes everything
all right here's a good comment i wanted
to take on so
wrong way to look at the tucker thing
scott he doesn't need to be on
eggshells with a bunch of people who
throw around the words white supremacist
well no you're agreeing you just agreed
with me
i'm saying that he's a valuable pushback
to the people who are word warriors so
i think you just said the same thing you
didn't disagree with me
any comments on lindell
again mike lindell
is such a useful force in the world
and that doesn't mean he's right it just
means
aren't you glad you live in a world
where there can be a mike lindell
somebody who's got fu money and he's got
an opinion
if his opinion about the election turned
out
to be more right than we understand at
the moment
that would be really really important
but wait
what if he's wrong what if he does all
this and you know manages to get more
transparency
and when you've really looked into it
you just can't find anything
still good still good mike lindell
is a patriot and a national treasure
not only did he show you did he show the
world that you can be addicted to
cocaine
turn your life around and be a big
success which is a really good message
frankly like what could be more positive
than to say
i had my legal troubles my addiction
troubles and and here i am i'm the
pillow king
everybody needs to hear that and number
two like i said every
big issue we need this creative tension
and he's one of the biggest people
creating that creative tension
and no matter which way it goes and i
actually don't know which way it'll go
you'll either win or lose but boy it's
good to have that creative tension
we need that so he's a national hero in
my opinion
no matter where this ends up
um it's his faith that got him there
somebody's saying could be
ron says tucker is brilliant and
entertaining which is a big threat to
the left
yeah yeah
tucker is uh tucker is really good
at being tucker carlson uh in all the
in all the right ways and i gotta say i
don't agree with his opinions
quite often i was watching yesterday
and uh he had a whole segment that i
didn't agree with any of it
but again he's still a national treasure
because people are not doing what he's
doing
was your secret anything to do with the
physics discoveries no
it's a perceptual thing there's a
perceptual thing happening
in the country that i i can't call it
out
and i can't tell you why i can't call it
out but it's really big
and it's shocking
i didn't think well that's all i can say
about
remote viewing no i don't think remote
viewing is real
can i tell can i tell you something that
um i think enough time has gone by
that i can tell you a secret you want to
hear a secret
so many years ago maybe
20 or more years ago
there was a fellow was a dilbert fan
whose job was to research
uh esp for the government
yes such a person existed there was a
real person
who was in charge of finding out if
telepathy remote viewing and these other
things were real
what do you think you found so i spent
some time with him
and got to ask any question i wanted you
know we spent an afternoon together
i got to find out you know
what is the best knowledge anybody has
because he worked for the government
right
so he could he could get the best
knowledge there was on
this is it is it new somebody says it's
not news
the news part is that i talk to him
personally
so whatever you heard in the news do you
think it's true
you've been watching the news long
enough to know that if it was in the
news
no i hear the name dean radden i also
talk to him
but he's not who i'm talking about so
dean radden is part of the story
and i had some brief contact with him uh
years ago
well it doesn't matter who it is because
somebody's name you wouldn't recognize
but the point is
um i got to see what he believed based
on his
his work and there was a belief
that at least the remote viewing
couldn't be explained away
uh so that that's where it was so all of
the things like you know ordinary esp
you couldn't find any of that so that
you know if it existed it would be you
know trace amounts nothing you could
weaponize
uh it wouldn't be useful if it exists at
all and probably doesn't
dean radden thinks he found evidence of
it but that's controversial
uh but the remote viewing at least as of
that day
there was one person who had studied it
deeply for the government
who believed that there was at least one
person
whose remote viewing couldn't be
explained
by luck now
what was my reaction to that
i didn't believe any of it
i didn't believe any of it i didn't
believe that a remote viewing didn't
remove didn't believe any of it
doesn't mean i'm wrong
you know i mean it doesn't mean it right
i mean who knows
but i didn't believe any of it so uh
there's your secret
i did once have a private conversation
extended conversation
with the person who knew the most
literally knew the most
about this whole area and i didn't find
anything there
remote viewing is when a person who
claims to be able to
see things at a distance would describe
for example a
uh a soviet nuclear submarine base
and it could even draw a picture of it
and then when
the marine the the base was found on
satellite
they would compare the picture drawn to
the to the actual satellite
and it would be like spooky close
does that prove it was real no
because here's here's why i don't take
you seriously
if you and i tried to draw a picture of
a
let's say a nuclear submarine base in
russia
don't you think that your sort of
engineering brain
that decides how things should look
wouldn't be that different than the
person who actually designed the base
right so i could see that i could do
remote viewing
which would end up by coincidence but
not really coincidence because people
think alike
that whoever built the base doesn't have
a brain that's that different
from somebody imagining the base see
where i'm going
so i think the remote viewing is sort of
a
uh constructive imagination that's not
too far
off from the person who is being remote
viewed
and if they think alike as humans you
can guess a lot of things just because
people
think alike that doesn't mean you saw it
that's what i think
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
