so stock markets looking kind of good
today looking kind of
good I think that means we have to do a
show a show that is worthy of the high
stock market hold on let me adjust
this all right locals going look at your
comments because you're
special if it
works here we go
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you'd never had a better
time but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a
cuper muger a glass of tanker chalse
dinina Canen juger flas vesel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine hit of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and happens
now wait what is that what am I saying
oh
no damn it a UAP landed in my car coffee
no really just because you didn't see it
doesn't mean it didn't happen no
seriously there's a UAP in here Advanced
civilization it's doing things that are
defying defying physics I swear just CU
you can't see it doesn't mean it's not
happening oh I could show it to you but
there are
reasons
totally all
right let's get
serious now here's some science updates
uh you're not going to believe it I this
is unbelievable did you know that
physically fit people tend to be more
creative that's right turns out that I
don't know if I've ever told you this
before but have you ever heard that your
body and your brain are the same thing
yes your body is your brain if you if
you do your exercise and do your
physical Fitness yes you'll be more
creative yes you'll have less dementia
yes you'll be have a higher IQ stop
doing studies we all know it's true
now well there's another study from uh
Norwegian University of Science and
Technology they say that people who have
a positive attitude you know a mindset
that things will work out uh are built
differently and that a positive attitude
what what the researchers called a
growth mindset or belief in growth It's
associated with both higher willpower
and passion huh
so let's see if I understand the science
so if you
have a growth
mindset that's associated with being an
optimist here's another way to interpret
that a growth
mindset is an optimist it's not
associated with it it's what it
is there's no difference there's no
difference between optimism and a growth
mindset is there that the only reason
you would have a growth mindset is you
thought it would
work do any of you have plans that you
know won't work no you make plans based
on what you think will work so optimism
is a growth mindset because your
optimism isn't going to be about other
people it's going to be about yourself
of course you're optimistic if you have
a growth mindset it doesn't one doesn't
cause the other they're just the same
freaking thing all right science
science I Spit on
science no I love science I'm
kidding now you won't you won't believe
this there's another study according to
cost the physical activity boosts IQ in
kids and teens we know we know physical
activity your brain your body it's all
the same thing take care of your body
your brain will be better
yes uh here's another one from cost
religious service attendance linked to
lower dementia risk in black older
adults my why why must I be the one who
speaks out against
science
science do you think that this is a
causation do you think if you say hey
people if you go to church more you're
going to get less dementia
no how about people who are high
functioning do all the high functioning
things that people with high function do
and in the United States that includes
going to church because you can wake up
in the morning you're disciplined enough
um your life is together enough that you
can you know make it to
church no it's just it's just
Association it's not causation
sorry backward science meanwhile
according to Tom Perkins and the
guardian uh China just invented
something that will suck up almost 100%
of
microplastics and it's cheap and
scalable so they've got some kind of a
sponge made of cotton and Squid
bone you
know you know how I always say the
scientists they could have come to me
they didn't need to spend the money well
here's an exception because if they had
come to me and they said Scott we've got
a lot of microplastics we're looking for
some way to absorb them what are the
odds I would have said okay okay what
have you tried so far have you tried
squid bone and
cotton I probably wouldn't have said
that so this would be an example of
science that was worth doing you didn't
need to just ask me uh but yes if you've
got uh if you access to squid bones
which I assume are squished up and mixed
with the cotton it'll absorb 99.9% of
microplastics and water
samples my God imagine if that worked
and apparently it's reusable and
scalable and all that but how how
scalable could it be how many squid
bones do you
have if he tried to get all the
microplastics out of the ocean wouldn't
you run into squids really fast
seems like he be squid lless for before
long
yep all right um Reuters did a fact
check some valuable fact check now
Reuters as you know uh unlike some of
these fake news organizations you've
heard of them fake
news Well writers is real news so when
reuter does the story you can pretty
much Bank on it being right down the
middle and uh logical and uh well
researched that's Reuters good
reputation let's see what Reuters is up
to
today oh Reuters in a fact Jack uh there
was a story um that looked like it was a
CNN Headline but writer says it's fake
and uh the fake story said that Elon
Musk had melted down the Statue of
Liberty uh but Reuters wants you to know
that that didn't
happen or did it because musk responded
on an X poost he said no I definitely
melted it down one
1,000% so now I don't know did
he I know we get this CNN Headline that
says he did melt it
down and then reuter says he
didn't so that's a tie but then Elon
says he totally melted it down so that's
that's two to one that says he melted it
down I know I'm going to go with the
Statue of Liberty
no longer exists and it was melted
down uh but that's not all writers also
fact checked a uh well-known new site
called The Babylon
B uh that had a story that said that uh
alua abbar has replaced Cheerio mate as
UK
greeting and writers want you to know
that didn't happen they did not replace
Cheerio mate with aloa Akbar that did
not happen that was fake news yeah so it
turns out the Babylon
be um doesn't get every story completely
accurate I don't know I'm going to keep
an eye on that those guys because I want
to make sure they're you know playing
ball the way they should so we'll keep
an eye on them speaking of Babylon B
makes me think of the onion which makes
me think of their effort to buy um
Infowars
so there was some group backing the
publication the young in which I didn't
even know existed anymore it's under do
management I guess and they they made an
offer to buy Infowars because of the
bankruptcy
judgments and that got turned down by
the judge um I guess the reason was the
the people who organized the auction for
it didn't do enough work and maybe they
left some money on the table so the
judge said go back and try harder to get
more money for the Infowars Assets Now
did you know how much that was going for
I was trying to guess how much are you
going to pay for Infowars and what
exactly do you get do you get to take
over the rent for the
studio like what exactly do you get do
you get the cameras and the lighting
equipment and a desk if you don't get
Alex Jones what is INF Wars is it just
the studio and the name some IP I don't
know but
um so so the price for Infowars was
somewhere between you know roughly 1 to4
million so the the bid that um The Onion
made was on the low end they think they
can get closer to the you know 3 million
plus but it occurred to me that I could
buy infu
I didn't know it was
affordable I had no idea but technically
I mean I could afford it so should I buy
in fours what would I do with
it is there anything you can do with
it if I bought it and just uh said hey
Alex go do your
thing is is there any way I can make my
money back so could I buy it and then
just h Alex as my employee and just you
know keep some of
it I don't know I probably don't have
enough energy to pull off that
transaction but um if there's anybody
out there and you wondered what would it
cost own
Infowars you know if you're a
billionaire and you just want to mess
with the powers that be because the
powers that be wanted Alex Jones to be
on a business it would be just a
wonderful after you
if you had a billion dollars you know
I'm not I'm not a billionaire but uh I
mean for me it would be serious money so
it's not like that's not Pocket
Change I'm doing okay but that's not
Pocket Change
um anyway so make an offer three million
four million you might own
it um you remember act blue so act blue
is that big organization that allegedly
is uh accumulating small donations for
the Democrat Party but they were they
were accused of taking money from
foreign entities that were trying to
influence the elections and using them
as a essentially a money laundering
operation for their foreign influence
that's the
charge uh John Solomon of just the news
is reporting on that but apparently the
new news about that is that the platform
did not block foreign gift cards until
this fall
so apparently you could
donate uh using a foreign gift card so
that nobody would know who the real
donator is I guess and uh it would sort
of conceal what's going on and you could
have a lot of foreign influence that way
so apparently they've uh fixed it so
that it can't do that anymore but it
was
so foreign money laundering appears to
be
confirmed it appears be confirmed cuz if
they ever had the
ability which they do confirm to uh
accept these foreign prepaid gift cards
and we know they were doing
it we don't know how much influence it
was because we don't have a dollar
amount for the cumulative total but it
can't be it can't be
nothing or or else it wouldn't be a
story so the story is kind of empty
without knowing what dollar amount they
think could have been this foreign money
laundering but if I ever hear that
number I'll tell you if it makes a
difference meanwhile over at reclaim the
net the reporting on meta is uh tweaking
their their program for a censorship
I'll call it a censorship but really
it's getting rid of people who violated
the terms of service and instead of
being uh kind of one strikey
round um there's going to be some kind
of a probation period where
meta tries to educate you on why you
were temporarily BL banned and then you
can work your way back into their good
graces that's pretty good so I don't
know if this is a good idea or a bad
idea and it probably depends how it's
implemented but when I see Meta doing
something that at least on paper is
exactly what we want because we want
people to have Free Speech but if you
have free speech you know you're also
some sometimes going to violate the
terms of service and maybe not even know
it you might not even know you did it so
isn't it better for everybody and for
free speech if meta says all right we
don't know if that was intentional
here's a warning you know maybe a little
limitation on your account temporarily
but here's some education did you know
this don't do it again I like that feels
like
progress um meanwhile Apparently one of
the high hottest trends at least for uh
China on the consumer internet is uh
these short video dramas so apparently
creators are making one to two minute
episodes for for something that might be
over an hour um so you see only one to
two minutes for each episode and it's
designed for vertical viewing on phones
so it's not movie format it's that up
and down selfie kind of
format um and apparently the the traffic
and the money on that has surpassed
moving box office so it's already like
I'm hearing about it today it's already
bigger than
movies at least from
China and um to them I
say that makes perfect sense the thing I
worry about is the shortening attention
spans that the phones are
causing and I know for myself it is
literally just not possible for me to
watch a long forign movie I've said it
many times but I keep thinking I keep
thinking I'm exaggerating when I say it
and that you know 10 minutes from now
I'll be watching a three-hour movie and
enjoying it thoroughly but I don't think
so I'm starting to think that there's no
place in my life and maybe no place in
your life for a long form movie like so
the trouble with the long for movie is
they have to do the entire First Act has
to be bad news for the hero so the hero
has some purpose so I don't want to
watch you know 30 minutes of terrible
things oh my family was wiped out by the
bad guys or whatever and then at the end
of the movie massive people are getting
killed including the favor you know like
the the co-star who you really loved but
I guess they didn't make it to the end
of the movie and and then and then I
hate movies where thousands of people
have been killed including you know a
dozen people that are very close to the
hero and then the hero is still happy at
the end how can you be happy after like
12 of your friends just got wiped out
you know even though you won like so
everything about movies is sad and
archaic and doesn't fit the modern world
so maybe these new short episodes would
work it made me think I wonder if I
could do
one I have to look into this but it
seems to me it wouldn't be that hard to
get some friends together and create a
drama that's one to two minutes where
all you do is agree what you're going to
act out for a minute and then you just
sort of do it with your friends but you
make it look like you know something
bigger is happened could be cool
meanwhile Kimberly gilfoil has been
tapped to be the ambassador to
Greece and if you're not up on the news
you might say to yourself huh what will
done
J think about that but it turns out that
they are not a couple anymore Don Jr has
um found another woman I'll just leave
it at that so he's he's uh connected now
with some other young beautiful woman
and uh I I feel like there must have
been a lot of interesting
negotiations behind
this um the first thing I would note is
that the breakup didn't happen I think
until after it was obvious that Nome
would not be the
candidate did you notice
that because if Nome had been the
candidate Kimberly gilfoil would have
been so valuable to the Trump family
they probably would have told Don Jr you
know if you're thinking about breaking
up maybe just hold off a little bit
longer because wouldn't it be good to
have uh nome's on your team you know for
for all the like inside psychological
stuff but um probably a coincidence but
at the same time that that asset was no
longer necessary because nome's not
running for office for at least this
time um then Kimberly
gilfoil has put all of this uh let's say
time and effort and blood and sweat and
tears into the Trump
operation um and reasonably could expect
that she would have some home there but
then she can't really hang around
locally because her boyfriend's got a
new girlfriend and that's going to be
awkward so this looks perfect if it if
it works out for her lifestyle
wise great I mean she might she might
actually love being ambassador to Greece
doesn't sound like a bad job actually so
I I wish the best to all of
them meanwhile the American tour reform
Foundation ranked uh New York City as
the second worst judicial
hellhole especially for um lawsuits so I
guess the laws and the process there are
really friendly for people who want to
abuse the system so New York City
judicial hellhole I didn't see who came
in second or who came in
first but New York second so I would say
again New York City and really New York
State um I wouldn't build a business
there I I feel like that would just be
insane the the laws are so
unfriendly that it just seems like the
logical thing is to stay on in New
York anyway Mark Andre continues to be
interesting in his uh I would say his
new role as more of a public commenter
um we need more of him because his
public comments are unusually good he he
is
unusually smart and you know no BS so he
was uh I think he was talking to Barry
Weiss and he was saying that uh all
every government becomes an
oligarch oligarchy every government
becomes an oligarchy dictators
oligarchies so-called Democratic
countries republics
oligarchies and he says the simple
reason is that the elites because a
smaller group and they're smaller and
powerful and capable that the elites are
tend to be good at
organizing so that they can keep their
power whereas the masses are bad at
organizing because the elites might have
more in common which is you're rich I'm
rich Let's uh let's try to keep this
going so as long as the elites want to
stay in power and stay Rich they can
more easily organize whereas the masses
are like hey you're black and I'm I'm a
lesbian can we be on the same team I
don't know I don't
know so that makes sense and I would
agree with that that every government in
reality is a is an oligarch but I would
add a little wrinkle to that so this is
one of the one of the smartest reframes
that I ever ever heard in terms of uh
the United States is that we're more
like Game of Thrones meaning that the
oligarchs are not all on the same side
so there's an oligarch group over here
that has a lot of interest in one one
topic there's another oligarch group
over here that really cares about
another topic but still oligarchs it's
just that our oligarchs tend to be
divided into smaller teams that care
about things more than other
things so there's that but I would add
to the idea that every government
becomes a oligarchy I would D my thing
which is every government becomes a
brainwasher every government becomes a
brainwasher because they have to there's
no other model that works doesn't matter
if you're a dictator brainwashing your
your citizens doesn't matter if you're a
democracy or a republic brainwashing you
really can't not do it yeah the moment
you let the news do what the news wanted
to do who would be running the
country the news the news would and then
there would be somebody who became the
powerful newsers and that would
effectively run the country so if you're
in a government it doesn't matter what
kind of government how you got there
dictator or or actually a fair vote once
you get there you can't let the you
can't let the news run the country
because what if the news said let's say
you get elected tomorrow totally legal
election you're completely legitimate
but the news decides they want to get
their own person in there you know
somebody who's important in the news
business so they just start some fake
news and say that you're on a Russia
collusion or something and the next
thing you know people vote you
out so if you're in any kind of
a Democratic Republic or even dictator
if you don't control your news so that
the news is a reflection of what the
people in charge want it to be you will
not be in charge there is no other way
because otherwise you would agree that
the News tells people what to think and
if the News tells people to think that
the government is bad and everything
isn't
working the government will fall so so
brainwashing is not
optional you you want it to be but how
much you want it to be won't change the
fact it's not optional it really isn't I
hate I hate it but it's not
optional um let's talk about the healthc
care Hitman they call him um so they
caught him as you know at
McDonald's and one of the uh Mysteries
is why did he seem like he was such a
law-abiding nice kid with a gra future
and then he turned into some kind of
domestic terrorist like how how's that
happen but uh and I saw one a lawyer
lawyer Lee at least that's the name she
goes by on X lawyer Lee said I've been a
lawyer for 30 years there's a lot more
to the Luigi Mion story than we're being
told I'm highly concerned about his
claim that evidence was planted on him
well I can see why you'd be suspicious
about that because when you hear what
was planted on him it almost sounds like
a comedy well he still had the
the murder weapon in his
pocket what what days later you've got
the murder weapon in your pocket when
you get caught at
McDonald's and he had the fake IDs that
he used to commit the crime he had all
the fake IDs on him what and then he had
the actual face mask they wore during
the crime or one that looked like it at
least and and you think to yourself what
the heck's going on here
um all right so yeah I'm seeing in the
comments that there's an old video of
the the now deceased CEO saying that
they had good connections with Nancy
Pelosi so that their their business was
uh at least connected to the powers that
be so they were in good shape for that I
don't know if that was as big a
conspiracy as you think he was just
saying that he's got friends in the
government it's going to help him
so I don't know we we'll see so it could
be that Nancy Peli made some insider
trading money off it somehow I don't
know I'm just speculating so we don't
know what that Pelosi reference me meant
if it was important or if it wasn't so
uh oh forchan solved the
case so here's what I think I think that
the uh story about his back in injury
probably tells you everything you need
to know um he might have been on some
kind of medication for the back injury
maybe more than one uh that could have
changed his thinking it could be that
when you're in pain everything looks
different and maybe he had a death wish
and he didn't care if he got killed
maybe he realized that his life wasn't
going to
be him becoming president and having a
good life so he needed to be important
to make a difference in the world so he
picked this cause thought he can get
people on board and he was right
because um no matter what you think
about this
shooter the shooter's um stated
objectives were
met the stated objectives is to put
attention on the fact that the some of
these capitalist Enterprises are more
bad than good that would be his point of
view not mine now
I would say that he's got that message
across uh if you look at the way people
are reacting and the way people are
often showing no sympathy whatsoever for
the
CEO it feels like he he read the room
correctly you not the entire room but he
wasn't that far off base from where a
lot of people's minds already were
starting to drift which is I'm not sure
if these people have our best interest
in
mind so anyway I I still think he's
weirdly rational meaning that his his
views about capitalism are not off base
I mean I don't have a better idea than
capitalism but it's certainly true that
there are a lot of big company
Executives who are doing terrible things
to the public while making lots of money
that part's true and if he makes people
think about that more
he may have actually done something that
he wanted to do and maybe he thinks it's
good for the world I don't know now I
saw some the fact that he claimed that
evidence was planted on him would
suggest that either evidence was planted
on him or he is
crazy I don't know it it seems like a
weak thing to
say unless it's
true because he doesn't feel like the
guy who wants to claim that he was
innocent
is he really going to tell us he's
innocent but that it would make more
sense it would make more sense that they
planted the objects on him than that
this guy who was that smart had all
those objects on
him I don't know you you could you could
imagine it either way but I'm going to
go with my working assumption is that
his back injury is the explanation for
all of the change in his brain have I
ever
mentioned that your body is
brain this this the first time you've
heard it yeah his
brain should be completely distorted by
the pain in his body I would I would
think that would be normal so it doesn't
surprise me a bit
actually you may have heard that Trump
continues to tease his uh prime minister
from the north
Trudeau and uh he in his statement on
Truth he called Canada the great state
of of Canada meaning like a future state
of the United States and he called
Trudeau the governor kind of kidding him
that Canada is not important enough to
be its own country maybe it should just
be a United State
and here's the thing it wasn't long ago
maybe during the first Trump
Administration that if he had pulled
this calling Canada a state and joking
with Trudeau that he's just the governor
don't you think people would have gone
nuts and said oh my God he's
embarrassing us on the world stage He's
a Bully why can't we have normal people
in office he's not normal stop him he's
oh look at his tweets oh god oh
no and what did people do this
time when he insulted Trudeau bullied
him and put him in his place so to speak
here's what's
different Trump has
transformed from that bad boy who
couldn't stop doing all the wrong things
according to you into what I call a
character as a character he has the
freedom to act within that
character and and somehow we've just
given it to him because as long as he's
in character we kind of get what's going
on so what's in character for Trump is
this you know bullying his
peers you trying trying to get a little
psychological advantage on them
sometimes joking with them because it it
gets you to a better negotiation at some
point I I feel like Trump has
now he cemented his place as the person
who acts this way and it's okay meaning
that we all survived his first term and
he was this way but but now since you
know you survived it and nothing bad
happened because he talks his way now
he's just a character and as a character
he can be funnier I think I've taught
you that the reason AI can't be funny is
that it doesn't have a
personality you have you have to have a
personality in order to fit the humor to
your personality and it's the two of
those things that work if you take the
personality away and you just do the
joke there's nothing there it's the
personality plus the J joke that gets
you the the
humor so that's Trump he's got the
personality plus the jokes um Trump can
read a room better than anybody in
politics and I think Trump is reading
the Canadian room as well as the
American one I think Trump wants Trudeau
to be replaced and he's mocking him in
public so that the Canadians say some
version of oh did we just send our
leader to the United States and did he
just get mocked and sent
home basically this is a
killshot trump is using a linguistic
killshot on our neighbor to change their
government will it make a difference it
might it might it is powerful enough
because if if we had just imagine this
just imagine this imagine some president
of the United States who's not Trump
just some other regular president say we
send our regular president to some other
world power and after done the world
power literally mocks him as like not
worthy of being a president you can't
you can't even hold that in your head
can you America would go nuts we'd be
like oh no we have to get rid of our
president so we don't send somebody over
who gets mocked that way or we need to
you know invade the country that did or
something
but the having having Trump even gentle
even gently mocking
him I would think just takes his legs
out from being a
credible um politician in the future so
I would expect to see the end of Trudeau
as a political actor really soon I think
this might have been the last push we'll
see meanwhile Nancy mace
was attacked um on the capital by a what
she says a protr
man and she had to get a new brace for
her wrist I think her wrist was already
hurt and some ice for my arm and it'll
heal just
fine and the capital police arrested him
now you remember the story about the uh
the Democrat lawmaker who was who was
attacked by the white
supremacist you remember that story
right there was there was a Democrat um
lawmaker at the capital and uh there was
this white supremist came in and just
like started wailing on him you remember
that no it never happened of course you
don't remember it because it never
happened but Nancy mace got attacked
physically I wonder if there's any Trend
involved well let's see Nancy mace was
ATT
physically uh margerie Taylor green got
a bomb
threat
um burette also the law another
Republican lawmaker got a bomb threat
Trump got shot in the
ear do you see a pattern
yet yeah Republicans are still being
hunted the J Sixers are still in
jail yep still being
hunted well I think that's going to
change so Joy Reed did another uh
mentally unstable uh video where she
looks in the camera with the eyes like
this and I think Hiller's coming oh
people oh I think Hiller's coming Hiller
orange Hiller everybody can see it you
can all see it you can all see it
orangee Hiller's
coming and I can't look away I I watch
every second of her videos cuz I just
look at and
go
what what what happening here so here's
one where I can't tell is she really
this stupid or is she just doing this
for political brainwashing propaganda
effect she actually said that when um
Elon Musk and Trump and I think mostly
those two uh they talk about running the
country like a
business Joy Reed takes that
literally and then explains why running
the country exactly like a business
would be a bad
idea now does Joy Reed not really
understand how words work that doesn't
make sense doesn't she have like an IV
education and she's on TV every night
communicating very well does she really
not understand that when when somebody
like musk says run the country like a
business
all they mean is don't do stupid
 that's all it means just don't do
stupid because companies don't or
they try not to um and she turned that
into well if you're going to run like a
country I guess you get rid of all those
unnecessary expenses you know like all
the things that help people and like
no no everybody knows they don't mean
that everybody knows that just means
don't do stupid
everybody knows that does she is she the
only person in the world who doesn't
understand what it means to run the
government like a
business is she just
lying and or or trying to convince you
that she really believes this is like a
business I mean I don't
know I'm
actually my first instinct is You
couldn't possibly be that dumb to think
that they mean that literally and that
the analog holds for every element of a
business versus a
corporation but on the other hand it is
exactly how Democrats argue they they
argue like the analogy is ill
literal they they argue like hyperbole
is
literal I don't know she might be that
dumb but I I'm I'm going to lean toward
its intentional bad behavior and not not
something she can't
control uh mean meanwhile James Carville
continues to
entertain um he might be the only
Democrat who fully
understands what happened with the
Democrats and what they did wrong so
listening to him talk and having the
Democrats you know not not understand
any of it it's just entertain the hell
enemy so here's what he says
now he said well did the language of
identity politics really didn't hurt us
ever and he says it wasn't bad but
there's evidence for a fact that no one
talked about it in 2024 so he's talking
somebody else's argument that that
identity politics couldn't have hurt
them because the Democrats weren't
really talking about identity politics
during the
race um and carille says so he goes so
wait a minute if you have an idea and no
one talks about it and you still insist
it was a good idea it doesn't make any
sense right so the Democrats
their their their top thing was identity
politics but I think he correctly
correctly notes that when they ran for
office suddenly their top thing
disappeared it's because their top thing
was just toxic and bad for the country
so they couldn't even lead with their
top thing because even they knew it
wasn't a good
thing if they believe their top thing
was a good thing they certainly would
have made it the the focus of their
entire campaign so Carville is totally
correct that they were that their
philosophy even they knew was so weak
that they couldn't mention it while
running for
raus wow he's right about
that but he says and he points out that
uh you know one side doesn't get to make
all the rules the other the other side
gets a vote too so he talks about the
Republicans um very very smartly focused
on the identity politics because the
public you know believed that it was a
thing and if they C if the Democrats
weren't talking about it at this minute
certainly everybody in the country still
knew it was a thing
so he said
uh um he said that the late deciders 78%
of them thought Democrats wanted to
defund the
police now um it is true that there were
lot of Democrats who did want to defund
the police at one point including comml
Harris it's not true that they were
running on that I I don't know that
anybody was running on it but uh if 78%
think Democrats want to defund the
police that means that the Republicans
were winning on messaging for
sure anyway uh Carville will have no
hope of convincing the other Democrats
because they're still they're still
stuck in a gas deating environment they
really really genuinely don't know what
went wrong that that's why it's so quiet
I think they they they're looking around
and saying did we get did we get
everything wrong are we the bad guys and
the answer is yes you got everything
wrong and you are the bad guys
absolutely yeah that's not even politics
I'm just talking Common Sense whoever
opens a border to me that's not politics
if you open the Border
no I'm sorry I'm not going to call that
politics that that's a whole different
level whatever that is is not
politics anyway here's my favorite story
that kind of wraps it up
post-millennials talking about it um the
apparently the
uh the the black Comm campaign
staffers uh were complaining about all
the outright racial discrimination
against them during the
race so KL Harris's black campaign
people believed that working for the
black candidate they were discriminated
against for being
black does that sound like something
that really
happened I don't
know but I'll tell you this remember
I've told you that reality
is best decided by what is predictive
what is predictive so if you've got a a
theory on life that predicts what
happens next that might be as close as
you can get to understanding reality you
still might be in some illusion but at
least if you whatever your illusion is
predicts the next step well you've got
an advantage I mean that's good so let's
test this against my view of reality my
view of reality is that ident
politics destroys everything it
touches and that it does it in the order
of what it touches hardest and first so
anything that had lots of it and fast
destroys itself so the kamla Harris
campaign I would say destroyed itself
would you agree first of all that that's
an accurate observation that the
campaign was largely incompetent
compared to the Trump campaign for sure
so I think you agree on that so
certainly there was something
organically terribly wrong with the
campaign itself and we could see it
every day I mean it was obvious even
from the outside now we find out that
there was you know Mass problems and
that identity
politics were top of Mind within the
campaign so my prediction is that the
place that has the hardest fastest Dei
ident idy politics issue will be the one
that's most thoroughly destroyed the
fastest here it is so my prediction
holds now it's only a onepoint
prediction right so you you'd like to
see the prediction work for other things
so I would say that is destroyed the
campaign because the campaign had the
highest concentration of identity
politics so it was the most
destroyed secondly the Democrat Party in
general had the next highest f focused
identity politics thing and it destroyed
the entire Democratic
party then you go up to the next level
which is the United States but the
United States had half the country you
know roughly half the country who were
not on board with identity politics and
wanted to erase it from our our minds
and then half the country were deeply
focused on it that
predicts that predicts that you would
have massive problems from Identity
politics
but maybe your country would survive
because it was only it's not a
saturation see the the Harris campaign
was saturated with identity destroyed it
the Democratic party saturated with
identity politics
destroyed now I think the party might be
able to reform itself over time the
Harris campaign is Dead Forever she's
not going to run in 2028 and win an
election so so again the consistency of
my prediction so she had the most Focus
she's the most destroyed Democrats had
the next most Focus pretty pretty
thoroughly destroyed but maybe with a
chance to come back the America itself
had a
50% saturation which really really
 us up but we're a strong country
and we we had
enough
balls to figure out how to get out of it
because that's what it took it just took
it took people taking a arrow in the
back and the forehead and the side it
took people like me um here I'm not
trying to I'm not trying to put myself
as a hero because I was just doing what
I felt like I needed to do I wasn't
doing it for a bigger purpose
um so there you go identity Politics as
a prediction will destroy everything
where it's first and most
focused and you'll see that you could
put it on a graph and you'd see it every
every
place uh meanwhile Melinda French Gates
the the ex of Bill Gates is donating 150
million to a bunch of nonprofits uh and
a lot of it is to help remove barriers
for women in the
workplace
what
what
barriers for women in the
workplace what what barrier are you
talking
about here's a woman who clearly has not
had to apply for a job in a long
time does Melinda French not know that
if a man and a woman go into the same
interview and they have similar or even
anywhere in the same
ballpark um credentials that the woman
gets hired every
time every time in Corporate America
what problem is she is she fixing I
don't know any company that doesn't
prefer females over
males for hiring including construction
because even the construction guys would
be like oh we better get some diversity
in here oh there's a woman applying that
she has all the skills yes definitely
get the woman well there's a guy
applying too no no no we need a woman we
better get some women in here because
you we'll get in trouble so no I don't
know any company I've never even heard
of it in my entire life I've never heard
of a place that wouldn't hire qualified
women have you have you even heard of it
have you heard of one person telling the
story that the qualified woman couldn't
get a promotion or a
raise even
once now I absolutely believe it was
true in our past and and you don't have
to go that far back for it to be true
70s 80s definitely true then but today
today
2024 it's not even close women have far
advantages over men in employment it's
not even close what what world is she
living in it's it's
puzzling but I would use her as an
example of somebody who unlike James
Carville she doesn't know that she's
making things
worse it when I look at this it almost
looks like it's revenge against Bill
Gates like it's some kind of angry way
to spend his money on something that's
just he would hate because do you think
Bill Gates is happy to see $150 million
of what used to be his money go to
something that because Bill Gates is not
an idiot he knows that Microsoft loves
hiring women he knows
it my
God all
right so there's a story that the
Department of Justice back in the old
Trump Administration
spied on cash Patel and other federal
employees including two house
members um and it had something to do
with
uh cash Patel looking into the Russia
collusion hoax I
think I have a little uncertainty about
this story but uh what seems to be true
is the the Department of Justice did spy
on cash Patel and other people um
whether they had good reason to do that
we haven't heard any so
uh I do have a feeling
that cash might be going into that FBI
job with a little bit of a chip on his
shoulder and boy does he deserve a chip
on his shoulder if there's
anybody who who you would allow to
operate with a chip on their shoulder as
him because it's a real Chip it's he's
not imagining it like they really went
after him so even though that was the
Trump Administration the the doj wasn't
I don't think I think it's fair to say
Trump did not
order the he did not order the
investigation of cash Patel so the doj
has some
answering uh but also on the cash Patel
story um he said on Steve bannon's war
room on a 2023 episode that uh we will
go out and find the conspirators not
just in government but in the
media and he said quote yes we're going
to come after the people in the media
who lied about American citizens who
helped Joe Biden rig election elections
we're going to come after you whether
that's criminally or civil we're going
to figure that out but yeah we're
putting you all on
notice now here's my
question where's the
crime it's certainly bad
behavior for the the media to collude
with the Democrats and and effectively
lie and create hoaxes and and support
narratives say no we not true but is
that
illegal is it even something you could
sue over because it's sort of how our
entire system works I if you could if
you could uh
criminalize the actions or civil sue
somebody for for who is in politics if
they also influence the news to let's
say use their
narrative is that illegal
and is it only illegal if they're making
up something that isn't true like the
Russia collusion Oaks what if what if
somebody influences Fox News just by
being a really good
guest just some Republican they're just
really good guest and then that really
good guest goes on Fox News
hypothetically and then the other host
the opinion people listen to it they go
oh wow that's a pretty good opinion that
the way that person stated it is so good
I'm going to adopt that I like it would
that be a case of the media colluding
with a
Republican or would it just be
Republicans and commenters saying oh
that's a good reframing of that issue
I'm going to use
that but suppose that politician came on
to Fox News and I haven't seen this I
don't know that this has happened uh I
think I'm going to be fact checked on
that somebody's going to tell me it did
happen but I can't think of an example
suppose somebody came on to fax news
they were a Republican
uh politician and they said uh blah blah
and they created a hoax just out of
nothing like the fine people hoax or the
drinking bleach hoax just some
hoax and then let's say Fox News adopted
the
hoax and maybe even had meetings and
said hey you know we're all on the same
team so we're going to push that hoax
now none of that happened as far as I
know I don't think that happens on Fox
news but what if it did would that be
illegal
and if it were what crime would it be
and if you could sue them
civil for what what exactly would you
sue them for because it's it's so it's
so basic that people lie about other
people especially in politics I don't
know that you could ever sort out like
what was too far what's over the
line I don't know this is catchy stuff
but do I think that cash Patel has
I think he has the right
mindset that the the way the media lied
to the people and worked with the
Democrats didn't look like
news I think on the right when they get
things wrong it's because they thought
it was right on the left when they get
things wrong it's because they know
they're running a hoax at least the
people at top know they're running a
hoax it's really different so something
needs to be done about the hoaxing but I
don't know that jail or
or the courts are the answer to it I
don't know what the answer is but I
don't think they are the
answer so it bothers me when somebody
who I would consider on my side uh that
would be the conservative side of
America where I where although I don't
identify as a conservative I prefer
their company and I prefer their
management so that's where I'm at um so
I prefer cash Patel and people like him
being in charge of our Vital things but
he does make me
uncomfortable when he talks about uh
finding the
crime he's basically saying here's the
people now I'm going to go find a crime
he didn't use those words but that's how
it comes across and that's never okay
it's never okay so I do not want to see
cash Patel or the Department of Justice
or anybody in the Trump Administration
um doing the Stalin thing where we don't
like Adam shift so we're going to look
look for everything that's a crime until
we find one I mean I really really don't
like Adam Schiff and I think he's bad
for the country in a dozen different
ways but no I don't want them to say
let's start with Adam Schiff and go see
if there's a crime we can put no nope
nope that's that's a hard no can't live
in that
country
so um and I hope there's enough uh
people on the right would agree on that
I know some people just want
revenge but you got you got to think
beyond
that
um I saw a opinion by Mike
cernovich that I wanted to add a little
too he said in a post today he said can
we finally accept that most of the
subway psychopaths are the result of
high dose of weed products and the
resulting psychosis
what do you think before I give you my
opinion do you think that uh high dose
weed products are causing the what seems
to be the increase in mental illness of
the dangerous
type well here's what I would add um if
you're talking about if you're talking
about weed that comes in a flower form
and you put it in a pipe or a joint and
you smoke it definitely
not 100% not
with not even 1% there there's no chance
it'd be like does this Anvil float no
not if it's an anvil anvils don't float
so
but there there there is a way which
Mike is
right because he he sort of generically
calls it highd weed products and then
some people said well you know um a
friend of mine did a vape should have
been a weed Vape tape but got a
psychosis now in that case it was like a
2hour psychosis I don't think that's
what's happening with the people who are
going crazy on subways I don't think
it's a two-hour problem it's probably a
life problem but I don't think vaping is
always
weed I think the Vapes first of all they
put in other chemicals second of all if
you've ever tried vaping and you've also
tried the the regular version of weed
the feeling you get and the experience
aren't even
close uh I I love ordinary weed the
legal kind but vaping not even a little
bit it's not even it's not even a little
bit attractive I know how it feels and
it just doesn't add much just makes you
kind of tired and stupid so if that's
weed I feel like maybe they're slipping
in a little extra chemical there I don't
know what but you know I worry that
there's like a trace of fent in there or
some damn thing so if if you don't know
what you're getting that might be a
bigger problem yes and then there also
some uh what's the word for AR like
artificial versions of
weed
um so if it's an artificial version or
something called spice or something made
in a laboratory but it's like they they
call it something about weed but it's
really made in a laboratory I I can see
that giving psychosis I'm no expert but
um so I'm going to agree with Mike's
take that uh what he calls the high does
weed
products might be behind some of
it that's a it's a reasonable
hypothesis but um certainly not regular
weed is definitely
not
100% regular weed is not causing any
problems that look like that
um I woke up to see a claim on X that a
bus-sized drone had crashed in New York
or New Jersey and the roads were closed
and soon we would see these alien uaps
or UFOs because one of them the size of
a bus crashed and they got it surrounded
and they're looking into
it but it turns out it was just an
automobile accident and there was
nothing like a
UFO it was
fake then of course have you seen some
of the impressive videos of these
shining objects sometimes going into the
ocean and sometimes coming out do those
look real to
you that those videos look
real it it's kind of it's messing with
my head synthetic thank you all morning
I've been trying to think of the word
synthetic referring to the um weed there
is a synthetic form of marijuana that I
wouldn't trust at all like not even a
little little bit I I wouldn't go near
it um but so if if that's the kind of
product that uh Mike COV is talking
about the
synthetics and maybe The
Vaping yeah I would stay away from those
I I would stay way away from both of
those all right so yeah I don't believe
any of the videos but it's funny that we
live in a time when videos are easier to
fake because of
AI um and we're getting tons of videos
so here's my theory some experts said
the same
thing that uh the fact that the FBI says
they don't know what it is doesn't mean
anything that doesn't mean that the
government's not
involved if it's really a top secret
drone exercise the FBI would not know
the local police would not know and most
of the military would not know and there
might be only 12 people in the world who
actually know and it might be the 12
people in some deep secret military
thing where they're sending the drones
around now the second question would
be
um and this I'm I'm stealing this from
an expert whose name I forgot to write
down so I'm a terrible person oh Emerson
Emerson is his name um and he was saying
that uh if the Jones being tested are
for collecting data so they might be
prac practicing sucking up massive phone
calls cell phones they might be
practicing I don't know um navigation
without GPS they might be
practicing um some kind of just
monitoring people's behavior something
like that
so he thinks that there might be a test
of signal signal interception equipment
that the that they wouldn't want to tell
you about
let's say let's say you developed a
drone which is made to hover over
populated areas and suck up all their
cell phone
conversations would you tell the
public you can't tell the public and it
might be the only way you could test it
the only way you could test it is on a
real
population but the real population would
say are you kidding you are just testing
stealing my cell phone data no thank you
how how about you stop that right
away
um but let's say it was necessary let's
say the military said you know this is
not ideal but it's the only way we can
test it has to be over real population
and we won't use the data so we'll see
if we can collect it but then we we
won't collate it or attach it to any
personality so we won't actually do
anything that puts you in danger but it
will test the technology could it absorb
these signals and and store them so
maybe um my guess is that it's a
military operation otherwise we'd see
military response obviously we'd see a
military response by now so it's got to
be military and I don't think the FBI
necessarily knows and I don't think the
local police know but the tell is that
people like the governor of New Jersey
say things like we don't think there's a
threat how do you know that if you don't
know what it
is the only way you know it's not a
threat the only way is if the people who
are doing it to told you to say
that that's the only way so if the
governor got a call from somebody who
said you know I can't tell you what's
going on but I can assure you and and
the only thing you have to go on is my
credibility as let's say a general in
the military maybe some general the only
thing I can offer you is my credibility
of you know 30 years in the service I'm
a general I assure you there's no risk
to the public but beyond that we have no
information to give
you doesn't it sound like that happened
I think that happened otherwise the
governor would already
be you know maybe moving people out of
the zone or something you'd relocate
people so I think the governor must have
been told and maybe the local police
must have been told that it's no risk
and the only person who could tell them
that are the people behind it nobody
else would
know so I think it's kind of obvious
what it is it's obviously military it's
obvious that the authorities don't know
the details but they have been told not
to
worry all
right
um so some of the January 6 committee
people they say Trump is trying to send
a message with his call for their
imprisonment so I think the January 6
committee was completely
corrupt but as I've said before I'm not
aware of a specific law that they broke
they seem to have lied they seem to have
destroyed um destroyed some
information but they would claim maybe
it was accidental I don't know but
there's definitely tons of bad behavior
you know there's lying there's you know
ignoring exculpatory evidence there
every bit of it was crooked and bad but
was it
illegal I I think I saw Jonathan Turley
say there's no specific crime that looks
like they could get a conviction you
know there's nothing that the public can
see that look like it's
illegal and I since I'm not a lawyer
I'll just take his I hope I've
interpreted that correctly but I I think
he doesn't see a path to a crime but I
don't mind that they're threatened with
it it I don't mind that they're
threatened because the the behavior was
certainly as bad as a crime I would say
worse it was worse than a lot of crimes
that are definitely illegal uh and I'd
hate that that nothing happens because
of a
technicality but uh certainly people who
engage in that kind of behavior the
January 6 select committee are some of
the worst human beings I've ever seen I
mean you have to be a terrible human
being
to be part of that that's I I you can't
respect any part of
that anyway
um so Republicans uh think that uh or
there's a think there's a thought that
no Republican senator is going to fight
Trump if he tries to pardon the January
6
people uh I would go further and say if
you're a Republican and you oppose
January six
pardons good luck getting
reelected if you want to know the
fastest way to not get re-elected just
go in public and say you don't agree
with the January 6
pardons you are so
done all right th this is this is a
serious Red Line any Republican who
crosses this line and says anybody on
the Janu anybody on the January 6 should
stay in jail even the violent ones even
the violent ones
I think you're out of business you
should
be I I
don't I do not see any possible way that
a republican could get
reelected with that point of view
although it would agree with the
Democrat they running
against so well I'm rethinking this on
the Fly um I'm thinking that the
Republicans wouldn't support the
Republican but they also wouldn't want
the
Democrat I don't know I think this would
be one where I'd rather have the
Democrat
win um well no cu the Democrat would
also be against the
pardon yeah I guess it's a little more
complicated than I first thought but if
you're a republican I would not fight
the January 6 pardons uh I would roll
over and find something else to worry
about um Trump has a new proposal he
wants businesses that invest over a
billion dollars in the US he wants them
to receive expedited approvals and
permits
now how big a deal is
that it's really big and if you seen the
stats on how many billion dooll
companies have been created in the
United States in the last few decades
versus how many have been created in
Europe so in the United States I don't
know what the number is 50 or whatever
but quite a few quite a few uh the
number in Europe is none
none in in decades they haven't created
a new billion dollar business in Europe
none now
why well why is probably red tape and
tradition some of it's
cultural but a lot of it probably is
just the red tape it's just hard to get
anything going in Europe it's harder so
Trump's instinct to reduce regulations
and make it easier to do business is
right on I've told you before that I've
had uh
numerous small business ideas for
California uh for example I would love
to open a cat petting
Cafe
um but it's
California so I go oh it's California
there's no point in it because the
California would make me you know try to
preserve some endangered frogs and I
would have to guarantee that I hired you
know diverse employees and you know I
would get sued for who knows what and
you know the power would go out
California is not really suitable for
starting a business at the moment not a
small business I don't know maybe a
bigger one would make sense
but so when he says that he will uh if
you bring a billion dollars uh into the
country he'll exploit the approvals and
permits that's a really big deal and
here's the thing that nobody said when
Trump said
this nobody said you're not the
president so he's not even the president
but he puts out he puts out this
proposal as if
president and and I think everybody
treats it as though he said it as
president which they should Common Sense
common sense says the real president's
you know disabled and if we have
somebody who can step in who's
legitimate because he did get most of
the vot votes yeah act like a president
so the fact that he does this without
apology you know he doesn't add anything
like you know once I'm sworn in you know
he doesn't have to do any of that he
just says what he's going to do and then
it's done I mean you could argue that
that he implemented it already because
if what he's offering is Expediting
approvals and permits he doesn't need to
pass a new law probably he doesn't have
to get anybody's permit Miss probably
probably if just some big billion doll
company wanted to do this they would
just contact him or Elon Musk who could
contact him they'd get to him somehow
and then Trump would say what is it you
want to build a chip factory Absolutely
I'll I'll have my people remove all the
stupid regulations and get you right in
business because I think I think the
chip manufacturing is maybe largely what
he has in mind because you don't want to
have too much red tape otherwise we'll
fall behind in Ai and we'll all be
dead meanwhile in Argentina a story
which I feel is
fishy you know those things that are too
good to be true are a little too on the
nose a little too
perfect well so as you know um
Argentina's new president m is a ex
Economist and he had very very big
claims about what he was going to do to
turn around Argentina and he was going
to do it fast and so today the news is
saying that uh Argentina is completely
removed the deficit meaning that the
government is bringing in more Revenue
than it's spending and he said with no
debt uh says there's yeah no
inflation so suddenly uh Argentina is
looking like a great economy or the
beginning of a great economy and uh he
says Argentina will become the AI and
nuclear
Powerhouse which is exactly the smart
thing you'd want your president to say
if he were the president of Argentina so
here's my problem is this a little too
good do you believe this did do you
believe that the economists came in and
completely turned the country around in
one
year does that sound real to
you I'd love to think it was like in my
perfect world this is completely real
because it suggests we could do
something like it but the question I
would have is did Argentina not have a
bunch
of welfare health care expenses that
they couldn't cut or did he cut things
that they shouldn't have cut and that
the real story is that the poor are all
going to starve to death because the
only way the government could cut their
cost to get rid of the deficit is to
stop helping people in need are we going
to find that out yeah this is one of
those stories where only the good side
is shown oh great you got rid of the
deficit did anything else
happen such
as I don't
know poor people dying in Mass because
the government isn't helping them
anymore like what what are you giving up
is there more crime because you had to
cut the police force I don't know so
just going to say that this story smells
wrong I sure hope it's true because I
would love for Argentina to do
well I would love I would love that
somebody with an economics background
did well by the way that was true in
India right isn't
Modi an
economist I don't know too much about
the Indian system but I think Modi is an
economist
right so uh here's my second question I
would like to know know the history of
economists Who Rose to the top office
and how often that made a
difference wouldn't it be fun to find
out that let's say only happened five
times in history and all five times the
country completely turned around in a
year because I think India had kind of
an economic Miracle with a economist in
charge right I I don't know enough about
India to know that that's true but I I
kind of vaguely think that's true so
give me a fact check in the comments if
you know more about the Indian
system uh meanwhile the uh
representative Jamal Bowman who's no
longer representative he was Ed in New
York he uh did some kind of open letter
uh which he said dear white
people that's a bad start dear white
people okay where's this
going uh and he's mad about the penny
verdict Jamal Bowman is he says uh don't
know why I feel the need to keep talking
to you meaning to white people um and he
said uh on Tuesday that quote white
supremacy is the reason Daniel peny was
acquitted oh my goodness uh and he said
he doesn't understand why people feel
the need to keep talking to white
people well
Jamal this might have something to do
with why you're
ousted so he's uh doubling down on
identity
politics and I was watching
uh oh Dan Abrams I think he's on news
Nation now used to be on MSNBC if I if
that correct um and he was talking to a
black lives matter leader who was saying
that the Daniel Penny thing was pure
pure racism and Abrams was who I believe
is a Democrat uh he was just
no he was a hard no on the penny
situation being about race I really
appreciated that now I'll need a
confirmation he he does doesn't he side
Democrat um you know not he's not an
extremist but I thought he was always
you know friendly to the left in terms
of politics so if you give somebody like
Dan Abrams who's friendly to the left on
politics to say this Daniel peny
situation nope nope absolutely not that
is not that is not about racism and I
agree meanwhile there's uh talk that
Laura Trump who is now stepping down as
the RNC
co-chair might be considering a senate
seat to replace
Rubio what would you think of Lara Trump
as a Florida
Senator I will not wait for your answers
and I will tell you the answer I like it
I like it a lot um and again I've had
you know some interactions with her on
interviews she's interviewed me a few
times on um
video and I'll tell you the one thing
you get from her like loud and clear is
she
projects
competence like you just feel it so
she's got the uh the Charisma the the
fight the connections the competence and
uh to Donald
Trump's uh point of view she is perfect
on camera camera loves her so if you
have and and her physicality I don't
think can be ignored um if you if you've
never seen her workout routine on her
Instagram posts oh my God she really
takes exercise and fitness to a level
that is inspiring actually it's just
inspiring so does she have the
tools to be a senator I'm going to say
hard
yes I'd be pretty happy with that so if
you had to predict I would predict that
she will be a senator we'll
see um Elon Musk apparently set a new
record for richness so he crossed the
400 billion Mark uh he's in the mid 400
billion range of richness now I'm not
the first person to predict this but I
think he's only two years from the first
trillionaire first trillionaire because
I think when the robots go online and
his Robo taxis go online and he's part
of the Trump Administration so those
let's say those things holding him back
regulations and red tape and law fair
and all that if those things are removed
which are his biggest problem weirdly
um it's not going to take him long to
get to a trillion because you could
easily see the value of Tesla
doubling right you could imagine Tesla
doubling in value in two years with the
robots with a you know even maybe just
with the cars alone but you add the
robots and for sure and then you add the
the uh self-driving
taxis I mean that's got to be worth a
few hundred billion right there so yeah
I think two years
two years until he's the first
trillionaire that's kind of
cool if if somebody had to be a
trillionaire are you glad it's
him like try to do this exercise in your
mind try to come up with one other
person in the United States that you
would be as happy if they became a
trillionaire name
anybody but he he he clearly puts so
much Blood Sweat and Tears into the
benefit of the United States not just
now but in the long future and the
benefit of the world um and making us
multiplanetary and God knows what else I
don't think anybody in the history of
anything has ever been so clearly
somebody that I would say
trillion go for three right you can have
as many trillions as you want
you just keep being you and keep you
know keep giving back to the
stockholders and giving back to the
country and the world and yeah we're all
good um and and then the other thing you
have to realize is that musk with a
trillion
dollars can do more things like buying
old Twitter and saving free
speech so that was worth a trillion
dollars and remember the trillions that
he makes probably just go back into
productive
Investments he doesn't he doesn't keep
money in a pillow he doesn't put money
in his
mattress he reinvests and he reinvests
at least two or three times he's
reinvested everything he had so he he's
all in on America and if you're all in
on America and you prove it every day
and you're working 120 hours a week and
it seems like it takes three of you to
do what you're doing and you don't have
to do any of it you don't have to do any
of it yeah you can have a trillion you
can have as many trillions as you want
that's fine with
me all right ladies and
gentlemen um that's all I have for my
prepared remarks I went on too long I'm
going to say bye and say hi to the uh
the fine folks who are at locals but if
you're on rumble orx or YouTube thanks
