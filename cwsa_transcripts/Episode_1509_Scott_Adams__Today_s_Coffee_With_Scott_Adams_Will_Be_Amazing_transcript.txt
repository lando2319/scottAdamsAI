well there you are good morning
welcome to coffee with scott adams
which you can't hear because i forgot to
turn on your sound i'll bet you're all
yelling where's my sound where is my
sound is what you're saying
how about now
how about now
well um if you are on
youtube you're saying to yourself
i hope he has sound
and now you do
you do
and if you'd like to enjoy today to the
maximum potential and i'm talking about
the maximum
don't settle for anything less than the
maximum from the simultaneous sip some
of you say you know i'll i'll just take
the minimum
no
no don't be that person
take the maximum and all you need for
the maximum is a copper micro glass
or
a tanker tell us to sign the canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
except the arizona audit it's called the
simultaneous sip and watch it go to work
right now go
i feel data improving everywhere
well
let's look at our stories shall we
look at our stories today you know some
days you wake up if you do this what i
do with these live streams
you look at the news and you say to
yourself oh god what am i going to do
with this news
this news is not naturally interesting
but some days the news is
naturally interesting
today is one of those days
but first an update on my cat the most
important story in the world boo the cat
had surgery yesterday
to remove a polyp
from her ear area that was causing her
all kinds of problems
and it looks like the surgery was a
success she's recovering i hope to get
her back today but i'll i'll let you
know
uh so that's the most important story of
the day
um
the second most important thing that's
happening is that my notes didn't oh
there there we go
so i just saw a tweet before i got on uh
about night condensation technology
apparently there's some kind of giant
sheet
you can put suspended over your crops
and there's something about the
technology of this big surface
that collects all the moisture in a way
that the ground itself doesn't collect
it it's like 80 more or something and
then at night
after the moisture is collected they
could just release it onto the crops so
they can basically water the crops
without rain
now
i don't know how stable this big
sheet-like looking thing is it looks
like the wind would blow it all the hell
but it does tell us that there's some
kind of technology there that might have
some some promise maybe maybe not that
exact one
but we might be able to water crops
without water
at least without rain and without
groundwater
that's pretty cool
rasmussen had a poll and asked
about the 4.6 billion dollars proposed
to pay for the afghan refugees to
resettle in the united states
how many citizens of the united states
think it's a good idea to pay for these
afghan refugees to settle well 56
percent said
no
we do not want to spend 4.6 billion
dollars
32 said yes
it's an interesting moral dilemma isn't
it because if you asked
should we get our allies out of
afghanistan people who helped us during
the war efforts
i think a vast majority of people say
yeah of course you've got to let your
allies out
but what good does that do
once they get out they've got nothing i
mean where are they going
somebody's gonna have to help them if if
we're gonna take them out of their
country
you know we broke it did we buy it
so that's the question
we broke it
and we broke the country and we broke
their ability to live in it
so we broke it did we buy it
i don't know
it's a it's an interesting question but
i would think that
we have some obligation you could argue
about the price tag you could say that
you know it costs too much everything
costs too much
but i feel like we do have some
obligation
that some amount of that expense we need
to eat
it's just a question how much
well chris cuomo is in trouble his old
boss
tells a story from 20 years ago
so when he worked for abc
allegedly at some party get-together of
employees and their spouses he came in
and he had just changed jobs so his his
boss was now just recently his ex-boss a
woman
and he allegedly gave her a big bear hug
and then while he was hugging her he
soundly grabbed her asked jake
and said
i can do this now
because you're not my boss
or we don't work together or something
like that so i'm paraphrasing but
basically he said i can do this now
because you know we don't work together
apparently his old boss
corrected his data
and said no actually
this may come as a surprise to you here
i'm paraphrasing again
this is not her exact words but
could have been
no no chris i would like to
tell you that is fake news she didn't
say any of this but i think she should
have
no no chris that's fake news the fact
that you don't work for me or with me
does not make it okay
to grab my ass
in public
now i know what you're thinking
he grabbed her ass cheek
and
you're all thinking the same thing
why doesn't she just turn the other
cheek
what you weren't thinking that
some of you were
well apparently that was not called for
in this particular situation
uh but did she did step aside after this
encounter
to show chris cuomo that her husband was
sitting right behind her
that's right
chris cuomo grabbed a married woman's
ass
right in front of her husband didn't
know that the husband was sitting right
behind her
now what is the most shocking part of
this story
that chris cuomo is still alive right
[Laughter]
what kind of a husband sits there
and watches his wife's ass get grabbed
by chris cuomo
and that there's no part of the story
where a fight broke out
chris cuomo was a pretty big guy
right i mean if we're being honest i
don't think you'd want to get in a fight
with chris cuomo would you
i mean he's got some big guns there i
don't know how tall he is but he looks
pretty big
i don't think you'd want to get in the
fight with chris cuomo
but even i would have taken a run at him
right i'm like half his size
but even i would have taken a run
i mean it might have gotten my ass
kicked but it'd be worth it
wouldn't it
is there anybody here who's a husband
who wouldn't take a run at him
i mean i
the very the minimum the minimum i would
have done is kick him out
i would have just pushed him toward the
door you know even at my size i could
have got that done
i was just kept pushing him toward the
door and if he punched me he's got
trouble but otherwise i'm just going to
push him out the door
and you know make sure he falls down
when i push him the last time
but
you have to get physical in that case
don't you
don't you have to punch him now maybe
you don't want to go to jail you don't
want to cause a scene you don't want you
know you don't want to ruin your wife's
career
but your wife just made you look like
the biggest in the whole
world
so i would like to nominate her for her
worst wife in the world
although there's some argument that
maybe the husband wasn't so cool either
if he didn't do anything in that
situation
but
everything about this is wrong there's
nobody in this story who came out well
did they
so chris cuomo looks bad in the story
that being the point in the story
the woman who talks about it looks like
a horrible because she just threw
her husband under a bus and that didn't
need to happen
and but her husband's got some
explaining too
like why isn't there part of the story
where a fight broke out
like where's that
now maybe the husband played it right
because
one can imagine that the wife would
prefer there was not a fight
right it's the wife's career it's her
life
maybe she prefers that you did not
defend her in that particular situation
but
i don't know nobody came out good in
this story
now will chris globo be uh
forced to resign or anything because of
this
this one's a tough one
i normally employ what i call the
20-year rule you know if you did
something 20 years ago
especially if it's verbal
you know just let it go but i've also
said you can't do that if it's a murder
you know if it's a violent rape or
something you're not going to forgive it
just because it was 20 years ago
and this one's sort of in that gray area
i don't know do you forgive this one
do you say well that was 20 years ago
that's a tough one
i don't know i think you could go either
way on this one
but um if you wanted to be supportive of
women in general you would go the way of
um
he needs to step down
all right
um
so worst wife ever
uh the so we're getting reports today i
know you want to talk about this so the
report is there's a
a leaked draft
not the final report just a leaked draft
of what later apparently will be
released today of the arizona audit
findings
allegedly and this has been confirmed by
the county all right
so although it's a draft
and although it's a leak those two
things normally mean not very credible
the county which does know what the real
answer is
the county says the draft is accurate
all right
so at the moment we believe that the
arizona audit found not only found
no fraud that would reverse it but
actually found that biden won by a few
hundred votes more than they thought
now
what's the first thing you think when
you hear that
all right first of all
we don't know that this will stand okay
can we all i know before you jump on me
can we all agree that we're in the fog
of war
and that whatever is being reported now
is deeply unlikely to be the same thing
you think by the end of today
everybody on the same page
does anybody think that whatever it is
that we think we know today
will be the same thing we think we know
at the end of today
probably not right i don't think so
now
i'm seeing in the comments let me
address this i see somebody some people
saying that the releasing the draft
report
is spin
and getting ahead of the story how many
of you think that that what's happening
here is that somebody's trying to get
ahead of the story
because the real story with the details
might be more damning and so somebody's
trying to get ahead of it and like
get that in your mind
so that it doesn't
so you can't be moved from it when the
real facts come out
do you think so
here's why i think not
you ready
it's too close to the actual release
if your plan is to inoculate people with
a fake story
you want to have more time
so if it had been an intentional plan to
get a fake story out there to spin it a
certain way so the real story couldn't
affect it much
you would do it much earlier
you wouldn't do it same day
right now i suppose if you were
desperate and you weren't good at this
you might do it the same day
you know because you got nothing else i
don't know maybe
but i don't this doesn't look like any
kind of a professional spin job the
professionals would have done it much
sooner that's where all the benefit is
it's the soonest that gives it the power
because it sinks in right
but if you just heard hey there's
something about the arizona audit and
then a few hours later
you got the correction i don't know if
it ever sunk in
so
it doesn't look like a professional
um
propaganda job
it could be an unprofessional one i mean
it could be somebody's taking a whack at
it and don't they don't know how to do
it very well maybe
but i'm gonna say that's that's not
what's happening
um now my prediction was that the audit
would not turn up uh irregularities and
it wasn't based on me knowing anything
about the election
it was based on the fact that it would
have leaked much sooner
if they had found the goods it would
have leaked much sooner
so
uh i alone among my audience predicted
maybe there's somebody else here but i
think i alone predicted that whether or
not there is fraud that's a separate
question
that the author wouldn't find it
two reasons they won't find it
they're not looking in the right place
and uh
if they had found something we would
have heard through a leak you can't keep
that a secret
nobody could keep that a secret
there isn't the chance in the world
that if they had the goods
we would not have known about it a month
ago just no chance
statistically there's some chance but
you know very very low
all right so
could i still be wrong
everybody listen to this next part
because you're going to swear i didn't
say this
okay
every listen carefully to this next part
i could totally be wrong
if you can't say that about everything
that you believe statistically to be
likely
you're not really
thinking
you're you're just punditing
so if you're thinking
that you say yeah i could be totally
wrong about this
by the end of today everything i believe
to be true could be reversed and i
wouldn't be that surprised but i'm
giving you my prediction based on a
specific
criteria which is it would have leaked
if they had the goods now here's the
question
there are two ways to rig an election
broadly speaking
right
two ways one would be to put in fake
votes
which seems to me hard
and also likely to be caught
so one way to do it put in fake votes
but it's kind of hard
well maybe it's not hard to put them in
but the odds of getting away with it
not so good because you can find fake
votes
the second way to do it is to throw away
votes that are real votes but you throw
away just the ones that will change the
election the way you want
how do you detect
thrown away votes
does an audit find a vote that that they
didn't get
how do you count the vote that isn't
there
did that was there somebody in charge of
missing votes
he said okay here's a missing vote
that's one here's a how do you count
missing votes
you can't count what isn't there
all right
and
you know presumably they would have been
thrown away long before they reached the
polling place they would have been
picked up and thrown away by operatives
the post office
whatever right it would have been done
by by areas where you knew there were a
lot of trump voters for example
now
did the arizona audit
also do polling
to find out if people who thought they
voted really did
i don't know i i understand that
somebody was doing that kind of work
some kind of was doing that kind of
polling
but i don't know if that's the subject
of whatever this draft report is
so here's what i would expect further by
the end of today i would expect that the
audit didn't find anything
but
big but
here's a big but and i'm not talking
about the one that chris cuomo grabbed
no it's a big butt
but not that one
actually i don't know how big her bud
was but sounds funny so i said it
i don't regret it
the big but is i believe that by the end
of today we will have an argument that
the arizona audit couldn't look at the
things it needed to look at
for example it couldn't get into the
software and hardware it couldn't
determine that there was a chain of
custody in some cases and it couldn't
determine if any votes had been
discarded
so i think that it's going to report
this as the things we can check look
good
the things that we can't check we don't
know
so i think your two movies will be
intact at the end of today
two movies one that says the arizona
audit found no fraud and it's done and
the other they found lots of ways there
could have been fraud
but they didn't know how to check it
now here's my next question this one's
fun
this was really fun to me
see if you think this is fun
the auditors these
uh ninja what are they called
uh
cyber ninjas
which is
a terrible name for uh
an election fraud
uh auditing company cyber ninjas
doesn't even really sound that credible
does it
but
did we not spend months listening to the
left tell us that the cyber ninjas could
not do this work
and that they were not credible
right
and then the cyber ninjas did the work
and came to a conclusion that biden made
had more votes than anybody thought
does somebody owe cyber ninjas a really
big apology
because did anybody see this coming
i'm not sure i saw this coming i mean i
didn't make a prediction one way or
another but what i didn't see
is that cyber ninjas would be so
credible that they found more votes for
biden and then just report reported it
that
way yeah and everybody's going to
believe them now that it another degrees
now that the left is getting an answer
that they like or we think right it's
too early to know that for sure but it
looks like they're going to get an
answer they like
and they're going to say well that audit
was pretty credible
it's a good thing those cyber ninjas
top shelf
you know if you want to know
for sure
whether you had any fraud call the cyber
ninjas
because they'll get you the right answer
every time
so cyber ninjas went from the least
credible uh
organization in the world to the most
top of the heap
best auditors of all time
all right
so that will be you know again just two
movies will emerge from that as we know
well two of the biggest problems in the
world got solved this week and i think
that's pretty good news
as you know
climate change is largely solved
or at least now we have a plan to solve
it
an actual useful functional plan
because as you know jennifer granholm
the
secretary of energy said for the biden
administration
there they love nuclear energy and it's
a
necessary solution to the climate and
even if you don't think there's a
climate problem i know we have some
doubters watching today
even if you didn't believe that you
still need nuclear energy because you
need a lot of energy and it needs to be
cheap
and we need it for space and we need it
for all kinds of stuff
so the debate against nuclear power as a
future power source for the united
states is over
it's over
i and i'm so mind boggled by this whole
thing
we i've never seen an argument that got
settled
have you
when was the last time you saw an
argument
where somebody won
i think of another example
what is an example in which
there was you know vigorous debate
for decades
and then one side said
oh yeah okay i guess you're right
i guess nuclear is good let's do that
i've never seen this
what happened
what the hell
i mean obviously you know the the
advocates you know mark schneider
michael schellenberger you know bjorn
lomborg probably uh throw into that mix
i think they did a great job
you know persuading i mean amazing job
sheldenberger in particular testifying
to congress probably probably changed
the fate of the world
let me say that again
don't know for sure because you know
many moving parts and lots of things
influencing other things
but from my perspective it looks
like michael schellenberger
changed the fate of the world
by being effective and knowing your
stuff and testifying to congress and
telling them you know we need nuclear in
the mix
i think he sold them
i mean i think that's what happened now
of course there isn't much of a counter
argument
the the argument is not so much
my point versus your point
the argument with nuclear
evolved into
people who were
well informed
and people who weren't
it sort of evolved into that
and once
enough people got informed
thank you mark schneider thank you
michael shellenberger
once people were informed they were all
on the same side
turns out
at least the people in charge so that's
a gigantic thing i mean i i don't know
how
i just don't know how to say enough
about that i mean that's really the fate
of the planet
got decided
the right way
now what have i told you about the uh
there's a thing called the adams law of
slow-moving disasters have you heard of
it
i talk about it all the time if you can
see a disaster coming
decades ahead such as imagining we'll
run out of oil or imagining we'll run
into food or
imagine whatever will happen in you know
50 years if you have enough time
humans are always good at adapting we're
really good at that kind of problem oh
we got lots of time all right we'll fix
that
and it looks like we did
i mean there's a ton of work that would
have to do be done to develop
you know the new models of nuclear and
to build the existing ones etc
but we have a plan
and the plan is well within the the
doable
you know channel of humankind can
humankind pull this off
make enough nuclear reactors to
you know really get on top of climate
change in the long run i think so yeah i
mean that doesn't mean we will
but do we have that capability yeah yeah
turns out we do so we actually have
a plan
that looks like it could
solve climate change
that's like this week
as of this week
we solved climate change going forward
the second big thing is the the pandemic
got solved i don't know if you saw this
story a lot of you think that
we don't have a solution to the pandemic
even with vaccinations
but
no the pandemic got solved
this week
i solved it because i had some spare
time
i know you would have done it
but maybe your schedule was a little
busier than mine
and i looked around and i said well i've
got some time what would be the thing to
do
solve solve the pandemic
so i did it
now i just released a video
that was on the locals platform only
until a few minutes ago so i just
i released it from it's uh
it's it's a captive wrapper
um so you can all see it now it's on
twitter
and in this video i explain
my plan
for solving the pandemic now you have to
see the video to see the visual because
it's more persuasive with the visual but
it goes like this
say you're in a room
with good ventilation
what are the odds of getting covered
masks or no masks
well if the ventilation is good enough
it would be almost equivalent to being
outdoors
right
that's what good ventilation is
you know at least gets you closer to
what outdoors would be like
but
lots of places are not well ventilated
so let's talk about ventilation
separately
everything i say after this
um
everything i said sorry i just got some
news that was complicated
everything i say after this uh well i
don't know what the beginning of that
sentence was anymore so let me start a
new sentence
one that i can finish
with a point
okay
so in a room that doesn't have good
ventilation there are lots of those
right
a normal room all right a normal room in
a house i would say it doesn't have
great ventilation it just has good
enough but it might not be good enough
for the coronavirus
it might be good enough for you know
heating and cooling and keeping you
alive but maybe not good enough for the
coronavirus
so what i'm going to talk about next
has nothing to do with ventilation
ventilation the purpose of it is to move
your virus from inside the house to
outside the house
i am not talking about that
everything i say next has nothing to do
with ventilation
but your brain
is going to say he's talking about
ventilation let me add a point about
ventilation
you know i see your point scott but have
you considered
ventilation
corey
stop texting me
during my live stream
so
in a moment i'm going to flip out
because in the comments somebody's going
to say
and they won't be kidding
but you know what would be even better
than what you're talking about scott
have you considered
ventilation
and then i'm going to read that comment
and i'm going to say
well i don't know what i'll say i'll
probably flip out
no i will flip out zachary i'm gonna
flip out
because there's one thing you need to
hear clearly
nothing i say next is about
 ventilation
okay
no ventilation
here's the idea turn on the fan
move the air around
you're done
that's it
just both fans just regular fans
in any room that you've got a problem
that you think doesn't have good
ventilation by itself can't open a
window can't open a door whatever just
put fans in there here's the idea
number one
fans will disperse your plume faster
actually really fast
so the big the big problem with
infection is if you get a big enough
viral load
if you're in a room with somebody who
has coveted
and uh they're on one side of the room
and you're huddled in the corner and the
other side
like this
what are the chances that you will get
covered
if the person who has the covet is on
the other side of the room even poorly
ventilated
even poorly ventilated what are the odds
well not that high
because the person is standing right in
front of the person talking well they've
got a problem because of the plume you
know that the cloud of virus and water
molecules coming out of a person's mouth
if you could get rid of all the
plumes
how often would people get infected in a
room with people who have covet
no plumes
well
here's my hypothesis
that 80 of the spread is from plumes
because we know we don't get it from
surfaces surfaces you know basically
kill the virus apparently because we're
not that worried about surfaces anymore
right we were worried about surfaces
before but surfaces seem to you know be
a problem
um
so the fan does
several things number one it immediately
disperses the plume
so does it reduce 80 percent of what
would get somebody infected because they
need a certain viral load for the
affection to really
uh
to to take root but also to get them
very sick
so if all it did
was remove the option that people get
very sick because the viral load they
get is a small one instead of a big one
that's gigantic right
but i think it would actually prevent
them from getting it now the second
thing that the air flow does
uh if the air is enough that you can
feel it right
is it
by reducing the plume
it increases the evaporation
now um
anatoly
who you should follow on twitter
uh gave us some stats and some science
that shows that that's the fact that
moving air will
reduce a plume and make it evaporate
faster now if it evaporates faster
what happens to the virus that is
carried by the water molecules the water
molecule disappears the virus falls to
the ground
so it's the water molecule that protects
the virus to get into you if you get rid
of the water molecules that protect it
the virus is less effective it drops to
the ground
so
you've got one thing that gets rid of
the plume so it gets rid of the viral
load almost immediately
so that's probably 80 of the problem
then you have the virus itself
less of it because the air is moving
around and now it's evaporating faster
and then the third thing again this is
hypothetical all any of this would have
to be verified obviously but if you're
moving the air faster
is the air bouncing against surfaces
more
often i think the answer is yes let me
let just give me a common sense um
opinion here in in the comments
does it make sense to you
that if you add some airflow
that the air will be bouncing off the
walls and the furniture more often
and we know that surfaces kill the virus
pretty effectively compared to you
breathing it in
right
now
have i given you three
practical explanations
that you say to yourself well i'm no
scientist but those probably almost
certainly make sense
ron says the air needs to move at least
56 miles per hour i doubt it i doubt it
imagine if imagine if you had a plume of
a cigarette smoke in front of you
and then imagine a fan on the other side
of the room enough that you could feel
it on your skin
that plume would just move sideways the
moment the the hit the air i don't think
you need 56 miles an hour
well actually let me take that back
maybe it is 56 miles per hour at the at
the point of the fan
but it wouldn't be once it reached the
interior of the room
um
i hear you say dehumidifiers and uh i
think a fan is just an easier
quicker solution the dehumidifier
probably makes a difference too
all right
so there is a there's my hypothesis
i believe that it's testable
you could find out for example
um you could put fans in some classrooms
and nodded others
check and check again in a month see if
anybody got it well you wouldn't know if
they got it in the classroom there's
probably some way to test it
but i would like to submit that the
pandemic is over and if you've got a fan
in the room you should be able to take
off your mask
yeah are you interested now
a little bit of science if it could tell
us that the fans do make a difference
could it be the difference between
taking off your mask in a public place
or not let's say a classroom
could you take the masks off if the fan
idea pans out
maybe it'd be a good trade-off because
it
if i told you about the fake because
a fake because
is giving somebody a reason when they
really want to do the thing that you
want them to do
they want to do it too but they need a
reason that sounds good to other people
so instead of saying hey
take the mask off do you think you can
sell that to people who are pro mask
do you think you will ever
sell to the pro mask crowd hey let's
just take them off
no no that's unsellable that is
unpersuadable
here's what isn't
do you know
if you had fans
they would be as effective as masks so
you can take the masks off
how'd that feel
it felt like a reason didn't it
but it's a fake because
because even if the fans do work
the masks would still work a little bit
more if they work at all right
so if you were concerned you'd still say
well how about bowl
but in terms of persuasion and both
would make sense maybe logically if you
didn't know the real risk and you were
concerned but
it gives you a fake because
politicians need to say i'll get rid of
the masks because
either because of vaccinations
because of other mitigation because of
this you gotta have it because
if they can't add the because they can't
get away with it
and maybe the fans
would be the because
because can you tell me because
can anybody here tell me that wearing a
mask would be more or less effective
than just increasing the airflow in the
room
you can't can you
because you don't really know how
effective the masks are but they're not
like a hundred percent
whatever effectiveness masks have is
probably sub 20
still worth doing if that's real
i mean if they really reduced by 20 you
would certainly use them in some
situations
but could you tell me that a fan
wouldn't reduce it by 20 as well
no you can't because we don't know but
logically
i mean if you just looked at the reasons
they should
i know kind of looks like they'd be
equivalent
somewhere in that sub 20 range maybe i
would think fans could have a higher
potential though actually
all right so that's the good news i
talked about that way too much i think
you'd agree
i should be talking about my cat boo
more
well it uh john stossel you all know
john stossel he's suing facebook over
censoring him for some
stuff he some content he had on climate
change
in which his content was not
unscientific
meaning that he did not say something
that scientists would disagree with
he did frame it in ways
that would make maybe make you a little
more skeptical about some elements of
the claims of climate change but he did
not
report a inaccurate fact nor nor is he
accused
he's not even accused of having an
inaccurate fact the thing they accused
him of is something that they imagined
he said and then dinged him for it
so so he got dinged for something they
interpreted he said that he didn't say
so that's bad bjor lomborg um i
mentioned again by the way i'll i'll be
interviewing uh bjorn
lomborg um
for his uh paperback version of his book
yeah that's coming up in some weeks
and
i'll let you know when that comes up
so
facebook has some explaining to do
now you notice that these uh the
censoring seems to be unique to
facebook in these stories
because i'm pretty sure that twitter did
not
suppress either one of them
in fact they're talking about it on
twitter
so
remember remember my rule
if you can't say something good about
something you criticize
you're probably not credible
you've got to be able to say something
good
about the things you criticize
so let me do that for twitter twitter
has taken a lot of heat for
you know censorship and
shadow banning allegedly etc
but in this case uh looks like facebook
got it totally wrong and twitter got it
totally right
it's worth it's worth mentioning
twitter got it totally right because
they didn't ban any of this content
so give them credit for that all right
there's a new story that uh biden's a
tax cheat
of course
um
just what he's trying to
you know get his gigantic tax increase
on the rich through there's a story so
here's the details and i know this will
be complicated
for most of you
all right
so i'm going to do my cartoonist best to
simplify this story
if you are an individual who is doing a
job such as giving speeches for money
which is what biden was doing between
between jobs
he made 13 million dollars giving mostly
speeches
now one of the things you can do and
it's very common
is that instead of taking the money as
an individual and then paying taxes just
like a human
you can do some paperwork with a lawyer
and declare that you are a s corporation
there are different kinds of
corporations the s corp is typically for
this purpose where there's like one
principal person who is the business
now
in that case you still have to determine
at least on paper
how much of the money that biden would
get in this case would be in the form of
looking like a regular salary for being
the ceo
of his own s corporation
which is just him
so not only do you define yourself as a
corporation
but then you give yourself the job of
being the head of the corporation which
is all just you so it's just biden
but he's a corporation but he's also a
person
who's in charge of the corporation all
right now in that setup you have to give
your ceo self a salary just like you
were an employee
while the rest of the money that you
don't call call salary
becomes income through the corporation
now the reason you do this
is that individuals pay more taxes than
corporations so if you can say oh i'm
really a corporation
then you pay fewer taxes especially for
the medicare portion 3.8
so
the higher
the salary is
the more you're going to pay in medicare
taxes
the higher the s corporation profit part
is that you arbitrarily define which
portion is which
the higher that one is the more taxes
you pay
so the game with an s corp is to try to
get away with
meaning that you're you're gaming the
audit in the future like if we get
audited
what is the least we can claim
is the salary for the ceo
and so the question is over two years he
made 13 million dollars that's let's say
six and a half million dollars a year
and he made a hundred thousand dollars
that he paid himself as a ceo
so it's two years so cut that in half
four hundred thousand dollars a year
to be the ceo of a uh 6.5 million dollar
operation
does that sound right
if you were the ceo of a 6.5 million
dollar business
meaning his profits were six that's just
the profits not not the gross
but the profit
pre-tax was six point five million
dollars
is that a fair salary four hundred
thousand dollars to be the ceo of that
size of a business
yes it is
yes it is
how's the audit gonna do fine
fine
is this story real
nope
nope
it's fake news
because if you go into an audit and say
um
the complexity of this business was
that somebody else would make
travel arrangements you know maybe jill
or an assistant or something and biden
would just show up and talk
and go home
that's the whole business
what decisions does the ceo need to make
in a business like that
not much
like the ceo job is actually an empty
shell
it doesn't really do anything that
because the employee makes all the
decisions the employee just happens to
also be the ceo
so is 400 000
too little to pay for somebody who
literally does nothing
not really
not really if the ceo job had actually
been hard
like where he had to manage a lot of
people and he had to you know make
decisions and strategic bets and stuff
like that
maybe you could argue that that ceo
needs to get paid a lot of money but
he's basically just a you know punch a
ticket
fill in a blank on a forum ceo he
doesn't do anything literally just signs
a couple of forms a year that's it the
whole job
so i would say that he's going to fly
through this audit fine
now if there's somebody here who's a
you know tax specialist or a tax
attorney or something just jump in and
tell me i'm wrong
but on the common sense level
400 000 a year to be a ceo of a business
that doesn't need any work at all from
the ceo
feels about right i don't know i feel i
feel will get away with that
derek chauvin um
is uh appealing on 14 grounds i guess he
couldn't afford a judge or i'm sorry he
couldn't afford his own lawyer at this
point so i think he did it himself
but among his claims
he says that his judge abused his
discretion
when he denied shoving's request to move
the trial out of the county due to
pre-trial publicity and i ask you this
question
i'm not a lawyer
so i'm just looking at this as a human
who you know has some sense of what
seems fair and what doesn't seem fair
even though fairness is not real
how does he lose this
how could derek joven
possibly lose this appeal
i've never seen a clearer case
where something should
move to a different venue have you
i
as as in the history of
trials has there ever been a cleaner
case where you absolutely needed to move
this out of town
because the people in the in the jury
would
justifiably be afraid for their lives
right
um
dr scott adams
one of my trolls is dr scott adams
um they just refused
i'm just looking at your comments does
anybody disagree with that
now the argument against it would be
that no matter where he went he would
get the same
the same level of bias
but i don't think the bias
would form a physical
threat every everywhere right
if you're local to where the crime
happened i think that if you're on the
jury you're physically threatened
but if you were in some far-flung place
and let's say it's two years from now
the appeals process moves slowly
two years from now in a different county
where they've already forgotten the
story
i don't know would those people be just
as afraid
as as the people in the local community
at the moment it's still really really
hot in people's minds i don't think so
i think it would be different
i don't see how he loses this
so
get your seat belts on
i mean i suppose a lawyer would have a
different opinion on this but as a just
as a human
if you ask me did this look like a fair
trial the way they did it no
no i'm not saying he's innocent
nothing like that i'm not telling you he
should go free nothing like that i'm
just saying there's no way that looks
like a fair trial to a reasonable person
looking at it it doesn't
and we live in a country where
it has to look reasonable to us
let me say this again
you know the law has its own standards
right and you have to satisfy the
standards of the law
but
the law has to
look reasonable to us
it has to
because
the whole system depends on that
reasonable people have to look at and
say well i might not like it
i certainly certainly wouldn't like it
if this law was aimed at me but
i can see why you did it i mean it makes
sense
it's got to be reasonable to a
reasonable person and this clearly isn't
i'm just not even close to being
reasonable
all right
apparently the january 6 select
committee
yes it's not a group of losers who are
studying something that doesn't need to
be studied it's not that it's a select
committee
premium
platinum grade
it's the platinum select
gold star
prime
committee
and let me tell you with a name like
that
you know that they got some good stuff
coming anyway they've subpoenaed their
first witnesses that includes
trump loyalists
as they're called mark meadows dan
scavino
steve bannon and cash patel
i feel like this is the
this is the uh the balance to the the
arizona audit
you know the arizona audit
the republicans are expecting some red
meat out of that
can get some red meat and maybe they
won't
um but i think likewise
the people who think the select
committee is going to find the
you know the the coup
fingerprints all over this and find out
is much worse than anybody thought
no
they're not going to find anything i
think it's just going to be a bunch of
people
doing what they thought made sense
at the time that's all it's going to be
so everybody's going to be
disappointed i saw a very informative
thread
on what
mild
coved
by
michigan noah
twitter user michigan underscored noah
no aah
and you can look at my twitter feed to
find it i retweeted it and he talks
about how we talk about the definition
of mild
cases of coronavirus
or covet a mild case is defined as
something that didn't put you in the
hospital
but turns out there are a lot of nasty
cases of covet
that didn't result in hospitalization
but they're pretty nasty and they might
have some long lasting effect
and so
noah makes the argument that we imagine
that the virus
is not as bad as it really is
because we're misunderstanding mild and
we're misunderstanding what it means to
not be hospitalized
in our minds not hospitalized means well
it's like a sniffle
right
okay maybe it's maybe it's like a
normal flu
but that's all it is
right if you hear mild a mild case of
covet you think sniffle
don't you
or or a little more than sniffle but
that's about all you think
turns out that that category mild if you
use it in a medical context it includes
moderate
and when you look at both mild and
moderate symptoms some of them are nasty
it's you don't want here's some
examples now i would say none of these
none of this data is what i would call
confirmed but i'll just give it to
you in one study two out of three people
who had coveted
had at least one outpatient visit to a
doctor
visit one to six months after diagnosis
so two-thirds of the people who had
coveted
a month to six months so this is long
after you should have been better
two-thirds of them had to visit a doctor
for one thing or another
now the first question you must ask is
how many people visit a doctor within
six months of adults
because remember most kids didn't have
it so you're not talking about the
healthy people we're talking about the
older people if you looked in the let's
say over 40 crowd where most of the
coping was how many people over 40
have at least one outpatient visit to a
doctor in six months
it's got to be at least
two out of three
[Laughter]
isn't it exactly the same number
as as this i don't know
but i guess i'm not as uh scared by this
because i don't know what the baseline
is but i feel like people over 40 get to
the doctor once every six months feels
like it so at least two-thirds of them
all right um but another study said uh
and of 233 survivors so remember it's a
smallish sample
found 40 were suffering from mental
illness
uh three and a half years after i think
this was after normal
normal flu
and
uh there's you know
chronic fatigue syndrome suggested etc
so the the suggestion here by noah is
that the uh the long covid and the
possible side effects might be more than
we think and makes the case that even
the regular flu
has longer term implications than people
realize even the just the regular flu
so if the regular flu has long-term
implications and we seem to know that
for some people anyway um then kovan
presumably would be worse because it
attacks you worse
well the pfizer booster looks like the
cdc head has approved that for some high
risk people
that got really bad didn't it
so the the pfizer
has
so it's approved for a third one but
because there's enough risk
that they don't want to give it to low
risk people say kids they only want to
give it to you if you're over on it was
65 i'm not sure if you need a
co-morbidity or not
but
that tells you it's sort of on the edge
doesn't it
you know
i thought we were dealing with cleaner
uh odds than this
you know the odds of getting vaccinated
versus the odds of not getting
vaccinated depending on what numbers you
believe or who you trust
should be a big difference
right now if the numbers are accurate if
if people are making up the numbers all
bets are off
but in theory the vaccination is like
many times safer
than not getting vaccinated but when you
get to
the booster
it's like well if you're over 65 yeah
but if you're 64
i don't know if you're
64 might not be worth it
but it's worth it if you're 65.
okay
i'm 64.
right
so
i don't know to me it feels like this is
kind of marginal
depending on your age maybe if you're 80
it's not marginal but if you're in your
60s you're like uh
i don't know got a marginal
here's my next question
why would you give
a third pfizer
booster to these people why wouldn't you
give them one moderna
would you be better off or worse off
with
two pfizer shots and then the booster
being the moderna
or would you be better off with three
pfizers
because if pfizer has the problem
you get a triple pfizer
triple the potential problem
but
if you gave them two pfizers and they
were okay so far
and then you gave them a moderna
do you get to the same level of
protection
but have you
have you diversified your risk
i'd love to see a doctor or an expert
give me an opinion on that because uh it
could be that it's just too hard to test
it because it's two different companies
and that you know just may not be
possible to test that
but in in concept
in concept
given the unknowns
and there are lots of unknowns
given the unknowns wouldn't it be safer
to give them a moderna as the booster
yes or no
well it's just a sort of an interesting
question i don't know
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the best coffee with scott
adams
all day
i mean since midnight
last night
i don't think there's been a better one
this this is this is it
so uh yeah ever
f r
f r spelled with an a
um
test for antibodies first sounds more
logical
anita says i need a buzz are you a
doctor
no i'm the person who's
got a better track record than the
doctors you know there's nothing that
amuses me more than when people say
scott
you idiot
you're not a doctor
why do we listen to you at all
you're not a doctor
well
my track record is better than the
doctor so far
i'm sorry it's just the truth i do have
a better track record than the doctors
now why is that
because i only pick up areas where i'm
confident so when they said masks don't
work fauci said it originally i said
i'm no doctor but i can i can spot
so i spotted before the doctors
did
now
do i argue with him about a long covet
or something no because i would how
would i know so i'll believe i'll take
the doctors over my own opinion on
things that i have no special knowledge
about but if it just comes to are you
being bullshitted
i'm pretty good at that pretty good so
yes my track record of just the things i
cherry-picked to talk about is better
than the doctors
it's a fact you can look it up yourself
uh update on boo i'll get an update this
morning but she survived the surgery
just fine and was recovering as of last
night and moving around
and uh but i'll get more information
today
now that is all we got for today and i
gotta run and it's been a pleasure as
always
and when will i see you again
that's right tomorrow
