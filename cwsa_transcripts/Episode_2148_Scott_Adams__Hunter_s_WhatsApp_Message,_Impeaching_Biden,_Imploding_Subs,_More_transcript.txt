do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
maybe some robots too
if you would like your experience today
to be one that you'll talk about to your
grandchildren
well all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tanker chills and style and a
canteen Jugger flaska vessel of any kind
except for a small submersible submarine
apparently they don't hold water too
well
but if you'd like to raise up your
experience to dopamine faucet all you
need is to take this simultaneous Sip
and it happens now go
ah
I would like to make an announcement
I'd like to make an announcement
should I ever
perish
in a humorous way
at least in your opinion I give you full
authority to laugh about it you make you
may make insensitive jokes
and I would be I don't know I feel I
would be honored by that
so if you don't mind
uh should I die in any way that looks
amusing like a bear attack
like if a bear kills me
that's kind of funny
I mean really it's kind of funny what
was I doing fighting a bear really
um or if some you know horrible strange
accident you know somebody drives a car
in my house something like that you have
my permission to enjoy the hell out of
it I'll be down anyway I mean if I'm
dead why should I ruin your fun so go
ahead and have a good time with it
all right uh here's my San Francisco
report I was not looking forward
to going into San Francisco for the
first time in
three years
I I live just outside of San Francisco
and I think I've avoided it for three
years which is hard if you live near it
you always have some reason to go there
so but I did want to catch up with uh
with a friend so I went in for a lunch
and as you've heard the streets are
covered with poop and the criminality
and drug abuse intense I didn't see any
of it
I didn't say a single thing
did not see didn't see a homeless person
didn't see a criminal
didn't say a tent didn't see a poop on
the sidewalk nothing
so
does that surprise you
are you surprised
and then we took a long walk pretty long
walk from you know one place to a place
to eat
and
no problem nothing looked dangerous
didn't see any sketchy people
[Laughter]
all right
full disclosure I was in the best part
of town
right
pretty sure there's I'm pretty sure
there's like a 10 block area that
there's nothing going wrong
I don't know about the rest of the the
city the rest of the city is probably a
sewer according to other people but if
you go to the rich part
it's all the same
it's all the same I don't think too much
goes wrong in the rich part of San
Francisco
all right um
here's my opinion on AI having
experienced it for a while having signed
up for many AI apps and having used many
of them
it looks like mostly to me
mostly now when I say that
don't take that out of context
of course Ai and its contribution to how
we work will be gigantic
right so what I say next is not is not
conflicting with the fact that AI will
be gigantic gigantic in its effect
however
I can make the following assessments
right now
uh not once this week did I want to use
an AI tool for anything
not once
and I've used them you know I've I've
signed up for a bunch I've used them
just see what they can do but not once
have I said to myself I gotta go back
there and use that the exception would
be you know Googling for just a text to
answer for something I do use that
so I have used the chat GPT to answer
some complex questions it's really good
for that I love it for that
but
you know I just saw that mid-journey
came out with a new update
that you can not only do amazing
pictures but now you can zoom into them
like and get detail in the zoom in like
like new detail that wasn't there before
that's crazy
and I said to myself my God what an
update that is that is so impressive and
then I said to myself
when would I ever use that
for what
I don't know can't think of anything
um
so
90 of everything the AI does
is done by people who do things you
can't do you got that ninety percent of
everything you see on social media is
like hey look you can do this it can do
this it can do this
but you can't do that
you can't do that in order to do that
you would have to learn a new language
you'd have to learn this language called
super prompt because if you didn't know
that language do you think you could
make that cool cool photo nope
nope you'd have to learn a whole new
language
in order to ask the right questions to
create good pictures which nobody really
needs
I mean impressive pictures the value of
an impressive picture just went to zero
you know that right
the the market value of a really
impressive image
is now a zero because anybody can make
one
so I'm not even sure people will care if
you've made a good image because they're
all going to be worth zero in our minds
um
so mostly it's about people who can do
things that you can't do doing demos on
social media to make you think that you
could do those things but you really
can't because it would be too much to
learn and you've got a real life to live
and you're not going to dedicate your
entire day to learning a AI prompt but
the people who do the demos they did
they put their whole week into
putting together a little package that
they can make a thread on Twitter
they're not you you can't do that
you're not even close
all right
if you have if you've tried to use AI
for anything but just asking questions
would you would you agree that my
assessment is on point
I don't say any disagreement but we'll
see all right
uh apparently I saw a headline I wasn't
sure which way this would go
Starbucks employees are let's say 150
unionized Starbucks so they're not all
unionized but where they are 150 of them
um are going on strike over the coffee
chains policy for Pride decorations
now how do you think that story is going
to go which way
they're on strike
over Pride decorations
are they in straight are there are they
on strike because they have them or are
they on strike because they don't have
enough of them which is it
on strike because they have them or on
strike because they don't have enough of
it
not enough yeah the answer is not enough
so there's some there's some uh let's
say
ambiguity in the story
because it sounds like the people going
on strike don't know that the thing
they're asking for they already have
which is they have the authority to put
up Pride decorations in their store so I
think corporate office says yeah go
ahead
put up Pride decorations if you want to
and then the the unionized people are
going on strike for not being allowed to
put on Pride decorations which the
corporate office says yeah go ahead
I don't know I don't really understand
the story but that's that's the way it's
presented that the strike has nothing to
do with reality
maybe I don't know something wrong with
the story
uh here's my take on pride month
as my regular audience knows I'm very
Pro
lgbtq I love my lgbtq people they're
interesting
they generally are low crime people who
follow the Constitution
Patriots all love them
but like anything
like anything things can go too far
wouldn't you agree
I have now some advice
for my much Beloved lgbtq Community
this is constructive advice it's not
meant to be any kind of a
criticism right just constructive advice
correct me if I'm wrong but a big part
of pride month is not just how the
people in the community feel about each
other or themselves
it's also a branding exercise to make
sure that the rest of the public
has a positive point of view
and I like that part
but here's my observation about pride
month which seems uh off brand for the
lgbtq community
because generally you expect the LGBT
community to be sort of a Leading Edge
and fashion and you know just sort of
what's new you know sort of the the
Leading Edge of what's next
but I feel like pride month is dated
does anybody have that feeling their
pride month made perfect sense for a
long time
but now it just feels
it feels like unnecessary
because I feel like we're well past the
point of
of you know are you a member of America
are you a you know a full
y respected member of the community of
course yeah at least for most of us
and it feels like you don't want to do
pride month until the very last person
agrees with you
that would be too far
you want to stop when you get the
benefits
before it starts being a cost
and it feels to be like pride month did
his work
I feel like it did its job and did it
well you know raised raised
Consciousness and all that but does
anybody else feel like it just the pride
concept feels dated
doesn't it feel dated
it's almost like calling black people
Negroes
like I like this I feel like we've gone
past that there are you know new set of
challenges
but it feels like Pride
I mean Pride doesn't even seem like the
right word does it
because why should anybody be proud
about their sexuality no matter what it
is
are you proud to be heterosexual I don't
know I just am
it's not something I'm proud of I just I
just happened
I'm not proud of anything about anything
that I was born
right am I proud to be white no I didn't
have a choice
am I proud to be my age
no
I mean I didn't have a choice about any
of it so I'm not really proud about
anything I don't have a choice about
it's just what it is
and I think Society is pretty close to
my opinion on that it's just what it is
if you're not breaking the law we're all
good
all right uh we'll get into the politics
in a moment so bobert uh representative
bobert
who is just one of the birds not a
Dilbert not a rapper not a cat Bert not
a dog Bert she is a bow bird
and she's pushing this impeachment over
Joe Biden over the Border
it's
um political theater that even Newt
Gingrich says is a bad idea
if Newt Gingrich says an impeachment is
a bad idea
I'd listen to him yeah I would listen to
Newt Gingrich when he says it's a bad
idea he's he's still one of the smartest
people in the game and he knows a little
bit about impeachment because he was
behind the uh the Clinton impeachment he
basically says they're not ready you
know they don't really have a case and
the worst thing he could do is bring an
impeachment if you don't have the goods
and they don't really have the goods
they certainly have a complaint
that Biden is opening the Border too
much but you probably need more than
that
I mean just just not doing a good enough
job isn't what they do impeachment for
that feels like it's more in the
political domain than the impeachment
domain but we'll see what happens it's
just political theater I guess I doubt
it will go anywhere
um as you know the uh male sperm count
well I shouldn't say male should I I'll
just say the sperm count
look how modern I am
look how woke I am
yeah the male or female sperm count
um
is going down uh every seems like for
years has been going down and there's
still a bit of a bit of a mystery but
I'd like to add my own hypothesis here
now the the primary hypothesis is there
something in the air or the food
so we're either drinking something or
breathing something or we're exposed to
something I don't know it could be
microplastics in the water or something
but whatever it is
um it seems that the sperm count has
been going down for a long time I would
like to offer you the following highly
speculative hypotheses you ready
number one I hypothesize
that women
well I I hypothesize that if we were in
a more dangerous climate
the sperm would go up
in other words if uh if people were
being slain in the streets you know more
than they are
that the Natural Instinct of human
beings would be to increase reproduction
now there's weak evidence it's very weak
evidence that during wartime women will
give birth to slightly more boys than
girls
but I just checked that apparently the
science for that is not firm there's
some indication of a small effect but
it's not always and so I wouldn't call
that science
it does make sense from a biological
perspective that if you knew you needed
more people because it looked like
people were dying too much
and life was hard you'd probably have
more sperm count
so just a hypothesis something you could
test
um here's my other hypothesis
women are less sexy
so men are not triggered to produce
sperm
here's why
uh and by the way I'm not saying that's
bad
just to be clear I'm not saying that's
bad
because in the 70s when I was working in
the cubicle environment
if a woman got dressed for work
it looked a lot like getting dressed to
go on a date didn't it
getting dressed for work in the 70s
looked a lot like getting dressed for a
date you got the you know the the high
heels and the tight dress and you might
even have a little cleavage
at work
in my day job when I worked at the bank
in my 20s
I'd have a hard on half of the day let
me be frank I just walked down the hall
and it was just so many hot women
who were of reproductive age
you were just basically boning out all
day long in your 20s like all day long
I'd be sitting in my cubicle saying all
right I can't get up for 10 minutes
because I just walked past what's her
name
right
any any guys want to back me up on that
and now if you go into a modern
workplace
what do the women look like and again
this is not any kind of criticism
because I don't think women should dress
like hookers to go to work
hahaha
I'm not saying that I'm not saying it
was better in the 70s
you know maybe the men liked it better
I'm not saying he was better overall you
know you don't want to send your
daughter into that situation right so
I'm not saying it was good
I'm saying it was different
and if you turned on a beer commercial
what did it look like
women in bikinis
beer commercial if you if you turned on
a sitcom
was there always a hot woman with
cleavage pretty much pretty much every
time
how about today
not so much not so much different
priorities
so
if you went to a modern workplace and
you looked at the women who worked here
and again this is no criticism
legitimately this is not a criticism
they would be dressed probably
comfortably wouldn't you say in a modern
let's say a high-tech environment they
would just be dressed comfortably what
are the odds that they would be wearing
high heels
if you go to go to Google and walk down
the hallway how many of the female
employees are wearing heels
probably not too many some
right
um and you would have a lot yeah a lot
more people going full non-binary and
and everything else
so I feel like as a male
I'm a far less exposed to Casual
environmental triggers
men men true or false you are less
exposed to environmental triggers all
day long
true now some of you are going to say
I'm getting just all Yes or something oh
one false one false now
some of you are going to push back and
say but what about porn
in today's world we have unlimited
access to porn wouldn't that be
triggering us all day long
yes yes it would
it triggers you and then you take care
of it and then you go on with your day
but apparently the science shows that
masturbation does not lower your sperm
count
doesn't change it at all so it lowers it
for an hour and you know you're about
you're good to go
so the fact that masturbation exists and
porn exists at higher levels than ever
before doesn't seem to have an impact on
sperm levels scientifically
but if you tell me that walking around
an environment with no sexual cues
is going to give me the same sperm count
as walking through an environment that's
only sexual abuse just everywhere
I can't believe that
it seems to me my sperm count will go up
if the you know if I were in a Target
Rich environment
so I'm going to say probably the the
biggest reason that sperm count is down
is probably environmental it's probably
what we're eating
it's probably what we're breathing I
think to water but I think it might be a
little bit these other things maybe a
little bit these other things
diet yeah
all right I have a an opinion that will
be provocative
you know on social media it seems like
twice a week
there'll be some viral video of a group
of people usually youngish
males beating up one person
now you're going to want to make this
racial but that's not where I'm going on
this
no not exactly
because
a group of people beating up one person
is equally bad no matter who is doing
the beating right
but when it turns out that the people
doing the beating are all the same
racial group
and it's different from the person who's
being beaten
um I would not call that normal crime
I would call that recreational racial
torture
recreational
racial torture because when you watch
the videos it's clear they're doing it
for fun they don't have any purpose
there's nothing gained they're not
robbing anybody they're not in trouble
it's They're laughing and they're
enjoying it recreationally now the
videos I've seen
they're quite clearly also racial
meaning that it looks like the person
getting beaten up is because they're
white
or because they're Asian American
but I don't want to make I don't want to
make this a racial case per se not in
One Direction anyway because let me let
me be as clear as possible
if I saw a video of 10 white people uh
torturing basically torturing by taking
turns beating a black guy I would want
all of those white people involved in
that murdered
murdered I'd want them all dead
right no no uh no qualifications
whatsoever
if if I had heard that somebody came up
with a high-powered rifle and killed
every one of those white people
torturing somebody
recreationally
recreationally for fun
imagine a bunch of white people
torturing the black guy for fun
I would want every one of those black
people murdered immediately just blow
their heads off kill them
absolutely just kill them I don't even
want a trial for those bastards
but it works both ways
right it's not even a racial statement
if you see any group of one group
enjoying themselves beating up somebody
of another group
that's not like regular crime
you know you could have a racial event
if it's just one person on one
but if you're torturing somebody because
these beatings are just torture
their torture it's a it's an extended
period in which they're just trying to
hurt somebody as much as possible and
permanently
they're they're clearly not trying to
avoid permanent damage you know a
lifetime of
crippling you know problems you know
brain injuries everything else
so if you tell me that this is a normal
crime when a group of people
recreationally torture somebody of
another race because they're in other
race primarily
that should be the death penalty
that should absolutely be the death
penalty but like I said if if some
vigilante wanted to take care of it I
would consider that justice as well and
it wouldn't matter again you can reverse
the races same opinion
same opinion if it were white people
they should all be killed
all right Bud Light commercial
I had to ask on social media if this was
a prank
because I couldn't believe it
now you're going to have to see this
 thing yourself
you have to see what Bud Light did to
try to get back its audience
it did a commercial with a bunch of
redneck white people doing dumbass
things
just like one dumb ass thing after
another humorously humorously being
stupid
now it did show one person of color
it literally had one black friend
they actually made a video of a bunch of
dumb redneck white people doing dumb
 and they actually had the gall to
give them one black friend are you
 kidding me
I I looked at that thing and I thought
this isn't real this is obviously
somebody's joke around but it's very
well the quality was good so I thought
wow somebody put a lot of work into this
fake
and then I found that as real
it's real
I I cannot be described how offensive it
is
to it to their own buyers just
completely offensive and
did they not know it
do they need some kind of advisor
I feel like Bud Light needs a a redneck
advisor
like they should bring somebody in with
a like a John Deere hat and a plaid
shirt you know packing a few extra
pounds just came from the barbecue and
just use them as the expert advisor
because I imagine you put them in the
room and then you show them that video
and his face would be like this
seriously
you're with me right you don't
really think that's the commercial
you're gonna put on do you
seriously
like all they needed was one objective
opinion from a customer
and it feels like they wouldn't have
done it
all right here's a little statistic I
saw online I think is real
but in fact check me if it's not it was
a list of countries
and what percentage of of them
um
are unmarried
but have kids so they have kids but
they're not married
in Iceland almost 70 percent
of the people who have children are not
married to each other
or anybody else
France 62 percent
62 percent of French who have children
are not married
62 percent
we go down the list Bulgaria 60 Norway
59 Portugal 58 Slovenia Sweden 55
Denmark 54.
now
um
where's where's all their problems
do they have any problems because of
that apparently not and now I saw it in
the comments some people saying that the
reason people don't get married
is that culturally it's just not
required
so there's no there's no legal reason
there's no Financial benefit apparently
there's no Financial benefit in the
other countries
so if you don't have finances you don't
have a cultural pressure
so they just don't do it
there's there's nobody saying why don't
you get married every day like the
in-laws are not coming over and saying
so when's When's the big date when you
get married I guess it just doesn't
happen
because people think yeah and probably
the the paucity of religion
now here's my question
if we were to watch this experiment
would we eventually say to ourselves
well no wonder France is uh turned into
a third world country
I don't know that there are any problems
in France do you does France have any
kind of a problem because of the
unmarried people with children
do they
what's the problem
I mean I know they have immigration
issues and but what's the problem
yeah taxes maybe taxes all right
so anyway that's happening
I just thought that was that was just
like a shocking number all right we're
of course going to talk about the
submarine story and of course everything
has to do with Hunter Biden
there's no story that doesn't go back to
Hunter Biden this should be like a
some kind of a Kevin Bacon situation the
hunter Biden is always one degree of
separation from every new story
but as you've already heard and no doubt
the story the submarine met a bad end
must have been some structural problem
and at least the people died quickly
they think I guess that's the best you
can say about it
um but I'm not too interested in that
story
I just don't find that story that
interesting but apparently this story
was coincidentally at the same time some
bad news came out about Hunter
which we don't know if it's true yet but
it's coming from a whistleblower
and there is allegedly a WhatsApp
message from Hunter
to his Chinese connection
and it's pretty darn damning
let me read it to you
so this is allegedly from a WhatsApp
messaging from 2017
between Hunter Biden and this Henry Zhao
his Chinese connection
all right and so Biden apparently wrote
quote I am sitting here with my father
and remember it's 2017.
all right so I'm sitting here with my
father and we would like to understand
why the commitment made has not been
fulfilled
tell the director that I would like to
resolve this now before it gets out of
hand and now means tonight and Z if I
get a call or text from anyone involved
in this other than you Zhang or the
chairman I will make certain that
between the man sitting next to me his
father and every person he knows and my
ability to forever hold a grudge that
you will regret not following my
direction I'm sitting here waiting for
the call with my father
um is that two on the nose
it doesn't it doesn't sound like a fake
phone call
if it were fake
it would mention the payments
right
it's not quite on the nose the reason I
think it's real is that it's not on the
nose on the nose would have said you
promised us some payments for
connections where's the money
right
that would be on the nose but here he's
just making this threat about his
commitments so you can tell that you can
tell the hunter knows he doesn't want to
say exactly what the commitments are so
he knows it's discoverable you know
ultimately it could be discovered so
he's still he's still talking indirectly
that's not on the nose
this is the way real people talk in the
real world that's why it's not on the
nose it's it's messy
it's a little unclear that's just like
reality
so anyway the whistleblowers are saying
uh that that's a real message they're
saying that they were
they were limited from asking any
questions about the big guy or the dad
they were prevented from looking into
Joe Biden connections so the the story
that came out at the same time the
submarine story which by the way
there's a sub story about the sub story
on sub stack
probably not but it should be on sub
stack
um
that that the government knew on Sunday
that the the sub had been destroyed but
they waited until the hunter Biden story
came out so they could bury it in the
news did it work
Ed let's see if it worked
let's see if I if I went to CNN would it
be a big old news story about Hunter
Biden and The Whistleblower let's see
we'll go right to the web page
um
oh let's see top stories about a
submarine it's about a submarine yeah
that's the top story but I'm sure it's
the second Story I mean give it given
the nature of the claim it would
obviously be the second story now the
second story is about the sub
but we'll go down to the third the third
stories about the sub but uh the on the
Forest Story we get well okay that's
about the sub but the fifth Story fifth
Story down is about the sub
okay that's about the sub 2 and that's
about the sub
okay here's some news about government
so this bit that's about Texas all right
here's the news no that's not it
uh but if I just keep going now I'll see
it of course
still looking
um it's I mean it's the biggest story of
the day so I'll be obviously it's uh
not there
it's not there
it is not just it's not just
undercovered
it's actually not there
it's actually not there I mean just just
hold that in your mind for a moment
we we have written proof and testimony
that the president of the United States
was taking bribes from China
it's not even anywhere on the CNN page
nowhere
now how about Fox News
now there of course we'll cover the
submarine as well
yeah so first story first stories about
the submarine
Second Story
whistleblower revealed
do you see the problem
I mean how is this possible
like how are we okay with this
let you know we have outrage exhaustion
uh you know so I'm outraged about this
but I'm outraged about so many things I
don't know where to begin so I don't do
anything about this like I'm not going
to be active about the fact that CNN
didn't cover the biggest story in the
news and it's obvious they didn't
what are you gonna do about it I don't
just talk about the next thing
act like it didn't happen
no I'm not just catching on to this
trick
dumb
uh anyway if you saw Jordan Peterson
tweeting that he got a message he had
zero new Twitter followers in June
and you probably said to yourself uh
that's not even possible because he's
got millions of followers to have no new
ones in June
so obviously he was questioning the
the algorithm there but um somebody else
said that was just a bug and then I saw
a screenshot where there are people who
had actually grown a lot of users but
they also got that message that they got
no users so I think it's the message
itself that's the bug
it doesn't seem that he got no users he
probably got users you just got a
message that said the opposite
so I'm not going to worry about that one
it looks like just a bug
go
there was a story that I didn't report
but I saw it again and I thought you
know damn it
I guess I'm gonna have to
I'm trying to do this without getting
sued
so it was reported in the National pulse
and written by Rahim and Kasam
who's a credible person you have to if
you don't know who Rahim is he's a
credible person this in this domain but
he says the uh there's a 2021 Holderman
report that just came out so even though
it was 2021 the report just was issued
that identified uh allegedly many many
technical holes in the Dominion voting
machines that are commonly used in our
elections
it's a 96 report 96 page report
and it says among other things
that the uh that you can put malware in
it in moments so you only need momentary
access to the machine to you know stick
in the drive or something and and
reprogram it so the first thing is a
just a casual contact with the machines
would be enough to reprogram them
casual contact you just you just need
access that's it
and then allegedly now these are not my
claims these are just the claims here
uh and that allegedly it would be easy
to change them in a way that would
change the votes
and would be undetectable in an audit
that's the claim
so there's a 96 page detailed report
that says the machines are full of
security problems and that brief access
to them
would allow a hacker to change the vote
and never be detected
is that too on the nose
it feels a little too on the nose for me
now part of me says anything can be
hacked
right but would they really make it so
easy to hack that casual contact with it
would be all you needed
I mean just a few minutes with it is all
you need to get in there that doesn't
feel right
I don't know I I'm guessing the reason
it's not national news is that it's not
credible
or or nobody wants to cover it because
Dominion is a likes to sue people so it
could be it could be that nobody just
wants to touch the story it's just too
toxic
might be that but it also feels a little
too on the nose
yeah which is our our signal for
it's like really 96 pages of problems
and nobody else was aware of it
really 96 pages full of problems
but Dominion wasn't aware of it right
but they could easily just go in there
and look from the outside and find 96
pages worth of problems
maybe I'm not I'm not going to say it's
impossible
I'm just going to say that what you
judge as credible these days
you really really have to be careful I
have no idea I don't even have the best
guess about whether this is credible not
even a guess
no idea
I'm pretty sure that you haven't seen
the other side of it
well that I know so so if I told if I
gave you a report that says you know
these machines are full of flaws but
I've not given you Dominion's response
to the specific claims do you know
anything in 2023 if you see one person's
claims without the defense do you know
anything
no no that would be that would be
exactly like knowing nothing
because there's always a there's always
a counter argument always and you might
be quite convinced by it
so
um you know it could be it could be as
easy as the machines they tested were
not production machines
you know like the defense could be that
easy
uh they didn't test the real machines
the real ones have better security and
then you're done I mean that could be
the whole story
I don't think it is I mean I'm just
giving you an example I'm just saying
that if you can't imagine that there
would be a totally good defense for all
of it
then your imagination is broken
right that would be a problem with your
imagination because I can definitely
imagine that none of it's true
but I could also imagine it is I just
don't know no information one way or the
other on that one
so I've been I've been watching uh with
some amusement
there are a number of videos on social
media that are all sort of in the same
vein and what it is is there'll be some
guy usually on a podcast who will ask a
woman or a group of women to describe
the minimal acceptable man you know for
a boyfriend or husband and when they
when they describe the sort of minimal
acceptable man
they have some requirements they usually
say you should be at least six feet tall
they elect them to make at least six
figure income
uh they want somebody who's fun got a
sense of humor somebody who's not obese
and somebody likes to travel
it's pretty good package right
imagine that six feet tall six-figure
income fun to be around uh good body
weight uh it likes to travel
that's exactly what the women are
looking for I just described Hunter
Biden
that's Hunter Biden he is six feet tall
has a seven figure income he's very fun
he's not obese and he likes to travel
so there's your perfect guy
uh another one would be let's see six
feet tall six figures from uh Andrew
Tate Andrew Tate he'd be another one
so ladies you do have options I mean it
can seem discouraging because you're
looking around you're like why why is
there nobody who meets my requirements
but there are there are
uh Hunters available and I believe that
both of the Tate brothers are single
both available
you said nothing about living in Romania
so that's on you
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
this is about all I had
I think even this shorter version today
we could conclude it's the best thing
you've ever seen
and uh probably all of my points will be
turned into talking points by
all the important people in the world
I think that's going to happen
or we could just talk about that stupid
submarine
All Summer Long
by the way is anybody talking about
Trump anymore does Trump have any legal
problems
who's getting all the attention on the
uh
in the election
what candidate is sucking up all the
attention
jump not anymore it's RFK yeah
so there's a funny thing happening with
RFK Jr that I'm very curious about
and it goes like this there's there's
one version of him where he has always
said crazy stuff and he's saying more
crazy stuff and that everything he says
has been debunked and disproved and
everybody who agreed with him has
changed their mind
so that there's one that version is out
there now you might not be surprised
that it's Democrat leading people who
have the version that he's crazy because
they don't want him to be Biden
however there's a version that I've seen
just watching a number of his interviews
which doesn't look anything like that
the one I've seen he's asking for
insanely
reasonable things
like maybe these vaccinations should be
tested more or maybe the company should
be you know not free from any lawsuits
those are reasonably good points you
could agree or you could argue them but
they're solid points of debate
um
so I would say that the the Democrat
smear machine is in full uh full action
but at the same time
I don't know if any of it's true
does anybody have an opinion that RFK Jr
has been spewing BS for years and none
of it's true
does anybody have that feeling
because that's what I thought a year ago
a year ago I just dismissed him as a
crazy guy
well I don't know so
so I'm uh completely engaged in trying
to figure out what's true and what's not
true with RFK Jr
because I'd love I'd love to know if the
criticisms are true because if the
criticisms are valid
well that would definitely change my
mind but the but the people making the
criticisms are the least credible people
in the planet the least credible if
you're going to make a list of all the
people you could believe and then all
the people you couldn't believe the
people who are accusing him are all the
people you can't believe
is the least credible people are his
enemies
so what do you make of that because it
doesn't mean they're wrong
there's a certificate
linking to something saying he's crazy
or something saying he's not crazy
give me the highlight of the cernovich
opinion
conservations probably looked into it so
I would I would trust his opinion on
this
all right we'll give you the
give me the Deets on that
suru says he is uh solid 100 percent
all right that means something to me now
when you talk about the least credible
people and the most credible people
I would consider cervich in a high
credibility
category
with the exception of peacek
I think Pizza gate just has to be its
own
special case
I won't make any more comments on that
I'll just say that if you don't count
that
you use a high credibility person
um
Vivek I see lots of comments about Vivek
so I don't think there's going to be a
third party run in either case I saw Joe
manchin teasing about it
uh
yeah but I don't think Joe manchin's
gonna do it he'd get too much heat
now I saw on I saw on YouTube that RFK
Junior's voice is going to be a huge
impediment
let me ask you this
you know that AI can fix his voice just
listen hey I can listen to his voice and
immediately I'll say translate into
smooth voice
because if you were speaking American
and used AI to translate into another
language it would also do that instantly
if you haven't seen that the aiai is
pretty much instant on translation now
so you could
and I wouldn't be surprised if he did
this oh actually if RFK had a special
microphone with AI built in it could fix
his voice for the audience
how hard would it be to build AI into
the microphone that just Smooths out
your voice
your microphone should get rid of your
you know how I always clear my throat
and
like I'm I'm terrible at this job
because I'm always making like auditory
noises they shouldn't be there
coughing and stuff your microphone could
get rid of that automatically
like you could actually be on microphone
and go and the microphone would just
swallow it and just wouldn't produce it
because it's not a word
good and you could teach it what noises
like uh it could even get rid of your
ums if you're one of these people who
was like
um and then I think we'll do that
um I think we'll do that
um
it could just get rid of the arms
yeah so
I would not be surprised if in two
months or so
somebody has introduced a a microphone
for a podcast the RFK engine you could
buy you could just take it with them to
any any interview and you know just plug
it into the podcaster system and then
you speak smoothly for anybody who wants
it
so it's possible
on the other hand it would seem less
authentic
so my guess is you wouldn't do it
because it might sound a little robotic
it might it might take away some of his
appeal but at least you'd have an option
now the other thing is that you he could
do his regular voice but YouTube could
give you an option to smooth it
because you know what I like I would
like that option on movies
um
can I
can I give you my impression of every
modern movie
I think you need to see this before I go
Alexa turn off Studio
all right we're going to give you a
scene from every modern movie
you ready
every modern movie
scene
I give you every modern movie
too dark
so you can't see what the is going
on the entire time even when they're
indoors
when they're indoors in the middle of
the day all the lights are off and it's
dark why
why
now why do they have to whisper all the
time why can't they let me hear the
dialogue why can't they give me some
Hitchcock Hitchcock dialogue
I believe I saw the person going into
the store
Hitchcock
modern dialogue associated
there's your modern audio right there
am I wrong
yeah it's like 24. everything's
whispering in the dark the whole time
is Tara like that
no it's not my hearing going because I
can I know how to turn up the television
it's not my hearing
then have you ever tried to watch
anything with a British accent
it's not hard to understand a British
accent when I watched the news and I see
somebody with a British accent talking
on the news I understand every word
every word no problem at all
but if you put a British person on any
kind of television show a scripted show
s
it's just like they're talking with a
mouthful of nickels or something I mean
I don't even understand how it's a show
yeah you have to put on subtitles do you
know people who put on the subtitles
just to watch a show that's in English
yep it's not because your hearing's bad
it's because they make it so you can't
hear it
it's made that way
yeah I'm seeing an entire list of people
saying they what they have to put the
subtitles on just to watch TV
yep
yep yep
all right ladies and gentlemen
what this needs is a little bit more
light on me that's all I have for today
I'm going to say bye to the YouTube
people
best live stream you've ever seen in
your whole life remember you can
subscribe to Dilbert reborn on Twitter
just go to my account and see the
Subscribe button and you can get access
to Dilbert
or you can join the locals platform
Scott adams.locals.com
and you get a lot more than Dilbert
reborn you get all the good stuff that I
can't show you in public
and uh
I'm not positive but it looks like Elon
Musk subscribed to my Twitter
Dilbert Reborn
I'm not because I saw a little subscribe
button on his account the kind that
shows up for all of my subscribers
he has his own subscription but there's
a different label that shows up if
they've subscribed to you and I saw it
on his account
so I think I think he subscribed I don't
know it would be smart for him to
subscribe to

he's trying to sell that service
uh administ Scott you were jealous of
Andrew top GE Tate
