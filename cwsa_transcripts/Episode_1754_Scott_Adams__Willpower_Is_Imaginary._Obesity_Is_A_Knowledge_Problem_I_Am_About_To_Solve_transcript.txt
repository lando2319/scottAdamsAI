do you know how good this live stream is
going to be
it's this good
imagine if you will
you had
an itch in the middle of your back and
you couldn't reach it
and then you realized that your back
scratcher is
right there
on your desk and then you reach down
and you find it it's like right there
oh
that's
how good this show is going to be
remember that feeling
yeah
i'd like to start
before the simultaneous sip
i'm going to give you value for the rest
of your life
now this is based on an idea that i
discovered
was somebody improved on
so the improvement isn't mine i'll pass
it along
the next time you feel you need to
sneeze and you don't want to
imagine you just sneezed
just vividly imagine not you
you don't have to say it out loud
just imagine it
okay i tried this the other day because
somebody told me it worked
this is after i tried the technique of
fake sneezing
because i taught you that if you fake
sneeze you can stop the real one
so what i told you was go ah too
hot you
it would fake your brain into thinking
you'd already sneezed
but then somebody won up to me and i
wish i had written down who it was if it
was one of you let me know i think it
was actually i think it was actually a
local
um
and i tried this
the other day like a serious knees
coming there was no way to stop it and
so i thought i'll try that imagining
thing and i imagined that i was just
sneezing
and it made it go away
instantly
instantly
i've never seen anything like it it
freaked me out
if you want to see how powerful your
brain body connection is
see if that works next time you're ready
to sneeze and for those of you that it
does work
it's going to freak you out when you see
how you can make a sneeze go away
but that's not why you're here
it might be
because you want the simultaneous sip to
kick off a learning experience which
will change your life
and all you need is a copper burger
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous
it happens now go
sublime
now i believe i told you that
i was going to teach you
that's the attitude that's it
john says under president trump the only
way opec could hurt us was to lower oil
prices
okay we're jumping right in with the
politics
um let me run through some politics and
then i'm going to deliver on my promise
to show you that willpower doesn't exist
and that obesity
is an information problem a knowledge
problem
do you think i can do that
i know some of you know i can
but many of you think that's not going
to happen
that's a that's an over claim
that is something he can't do
first the news
i saw somebody in the comments earlier
on locals think that i was not going to
mention the school massacre
do you think
that i would let a story that big
go unmentioned
second story
is about the new york times uh has an
update on russia and ukraine
russia has narrowed its focus to the
donbass region that's what the new york
times says
russia has narrowed its focus
when is narrowing your focus
the same as losing
is that just a
word play
because you know what i do when uh
when i want to make a billion dollars
but i make a thousand dollars instead
did i did i fail
or did i
narrow my focus
in fact i believe that every time i fail
at anything from now on
i'm going to tell people
failure
are you kidding
no
i narrowed my focus
in fact
can somebody write that down for me
because that's going to be my next
dilbert comic i mean seriously
how the hell does a cartoonist and i
have a pen
really
i don't have a pen within hands reach
this this is such a foul
let me teach you something about being a
cartoonist
you should never be
more than one step away from a writing
utensil
and something to write on because all
day long you're thinking oh i should
have written that down
five minutes later you've completely
forgotten it
so
i'm not going to make that mistake
i'm going to find something to write on
and it doesn't matter what it takes
i'm going to find some paper
i know i've got a printer i don't need
there we go
that worked out well
all right
wally
wally narrows his focus
in approximately
four to six weeks you will see a dilbert
comic
in which wally
narrows his focus
failure no no
but his focus got narrowed
so
um
i guess uh we've created a situation in
which uh putin can win while losing
and he can lose while winning
so both sides will be able to claim
victory which is the only way anything
ends
right
the only the only way the thing was
going to end is if both sides could
claim victory because we weren't really
going to
totally destroy putin
i mean did anybody think that was going
to happen
i mean it was possible i suppose but
nobody was predicting it
so the only way it ends is if both sides
have a complete story of victory and now
we haven't
now now putin will say well i i narrowed
my focus and succeeded like crazy i
captured that whole dawn bass area and
i uh
got my land bridge and got everything i
wanted there after i narrowed my focus
and then the united states and nato can
say
it's a good thing we spent that 44
billion dollars plus plus plus plus plus
because we got ourselves a ukrainian
victory
we beat back the russian army and showed
them that they can never do this again
so both sides have a victory now you
know
the best possible war is when both sides
win
i hate those old kind of wars where
you'd have a winner and a loser do you
remember those
that was such a bad way to go
today we can fight an entire war
both sides can win
here we are
do you think the russian public will
think that russia lost the war
nope
nope
they're going to believe they won the
war
or as they call it the special military
operation
that was refocused
well there's a some hacking situation
going on in which somebody got a hold of
a bunch of chinese data on the uyghur
camps
it's called the so-called xinjiang
police files so i don't know who did the
hacking but a whole bunch of photos and
and
communications
that among other things
prove that these things exist and that
they're used for political punishment
here's one of the crimes
that could get you put into a one of
these
uh prison camps i will call it as
opposed to a voluntary vocational
training center which is what the
chinese government wants you to know
here's one of the things that could get
you rounded up
not using your cell phone enough
no you heard it correctly
not
using your cell phone enough
for your own purposes
can get you rounded up and put in the
camp
according to these documents do you know
why
because if somebody doesn't use their
cell phone enough it is presumed that
they've figured out some secure
communications channel and if they have
a secure communications channel that is
signs of
working against the government or
something something something it's a
crime you're going to the detention
center
for not using your phone enough
so that's just one example but
apparently if you say anything say
anything bad against the government or
you
read the wrong stuff or you prayed the
wrong way or some damn thing you you
could get picked up and put in there
so
will this make any difference
i don't think so
do you
because did china really ever care what
we knew about these things they only
cared that we weren't doing anything
about it
and we're still not going to do anything
about it
i don't see any way that we're going to
say oh we're going to sanction you china
for these
uyghur violations
i don't think it's going to happen
so i don't know that this makes any
difference at all it might make a
difference in who knows what about what
but it don't it shouldn't make any
difference to the world
sadly
i don't know what it would take
there doesn't seem to be anything that
would make any difference china is just
going to do what china does they just
have too much power
or they would say not enough
so there's a story about five republican
uh contenders running for governor in
michigan
and five of them apparently were
involved in
as many as 68 000 invalid signatures
on petitions
so they were on petitions as opposed to
votes themselves so the petitions would
you have to get enough signatures to be
qualified to be on the ballot
and there are 68 000 of them that look
invalid
and
uh
and i guess there were 10 republican
campaigns and leaving five of them would
be shorter than needed 15 000 that they
need
now
it seems like a uh
you know some kind of a petition is
going to be
obviously way less secure than votes
but here's the thing i wonder i wonder
if republicans are going to cheat like
crazy
going at least the the ones that are
just starting i wonder if they're going
to cheat like crazy
going into this congressional election
cycle because they think they can get
away with it
how many republicans
running for office or their operatives
thought to themselves wow i thought it
was easy to get caught but i guess
i guess those democrats they would
believe
this is not my allegation
but they would believe that democrats
got away with it
what happens if one party believes that
you can cheat and get away with it
because they believe the other party did
not only do they believe the other party
did
they believe they did it massively
wouldn't that make you more likely to do
it
so i wonder if there's going to be some
kind of weird republican
like
backlash or counter response where the
republicans go cheating extra
you know extra much this time
and what about the democrats
do the democrats
believe that they cheated and won
and maybe that's why they won
do you think there are any democrats who
believe that
that they actually won because of
cheating
and if they do
why won't they do it again it seems to
me that because there were there were so
many allegations of cheating
and none proven by courts
none proven by the courts of any size
wouldn't that encourage it if people
believed it happened and didn't get
caught whether that's true or not
you should make more of it
right
everything that's rewarded you get more
of
we'll see
glenn greenwald con continues to be uh
entertaining in the way he uh frames
things
uh and he says
i guess he said this on maybe tucker
carlson's show
that the media is quote priming people
to believe that the perceived slump in
the country
is because you're too dumb to understand
your own lives
and
you know even though what he's saying is
something that you know you you've heard
in some way or you've thought probably
just hear them say it this way they're
trying to con they're priming you to
believe
uh
that the slump in the country is because
you're too dumb to understand your own
lives and i thought yeah that's exactly
what's happening
that is exactly what's happening
they say the democrats simply replaced
trump this is what glenn greenwald says
the democrats simply replaced trump with
the same ideology they governed with for
eight years under obama that caused
people to run away from them as fast as
they could he said
and now the people are doing that again
instead of asking why is that happening
they're getting poised to blame the
electorate for being stupid for thinking
the economy is bad when actually it's
good
and ultimately they'll just they'll just
say
there were too many
that the people were too racist to vote
democrat if they don't get elected
that sounds like exactly what's
happening
i wouldn't disagree with like one
one point on that at all
yeah that looks like exactly what's
happening and now that we know that the
clinton campaign and the democrats
were in fact
they were in fact behind the whole
russia collusion thing
this looks completely plausible
that there's this massive
massive gaslighting campaign to make the
voters think it's their own damn fault
or there's something wrong with their
perception
it's so it's so
um let's say flagrant
that it's almost invisible i mean i
guess that's the nazi technique right if
the lie is big enough you can't see it
because hey nobody would nobody would
tell a lie that big
well i guess that's the secret
um
erasmus at a poll said how likely did
cheating affect the outcome of the 2020
election so at the moment 54 of the
public
uh believes it's likely or somewhat
likely
that cheating affected 2020 elections
more more than half
now do you remember when people thought
that trump was not persuasive
does anybody remember that
do you remember in 2016 people were
laughing at me and they were saying
how can you say this cloud is persuasive
and i kept saying oh you just wait
you just wait you have no idea
you know what kind of tools he's
bringing to it
and sure enough
he at this point he could convince the
country of anything i think or 54 of the
country he could convince of anything
um rasmussen also asked how important
will election integrity be
in this year's congressional election of
course 82 said
important or somewhat important all
right so everybody thinks election
integrity is important
uh will anything be done about it yeah
as far as we know nothing right
are you aware of any big
big effort by the government to make
elections more secure
at least anything that's passed or
anything that's actually going to happen
i'm not are you
are there maybe some local things
happening
people have proposed things people have
talked about things
but as far as i know
there's nothing there's no global big
thing to fix elections is there because
everybody who ran an election
how do you how do you believe they think
they did last year
if you were to talk to everybody who was
in charge of elections in each
in each area of each state
and you said hey
give us a self-assessment
of how things went they'd say perfect
you should put me in charge again
i nailed it
most secure election of all time
and there's nobody else looking right so
who else are you going to talk to
the only people you're going to ask are
the people who ran the election
and the people who ran the election are
not going to give themselves a failing
grade
hey how was the election
the part you were in charge of well if i
had to be honest i led a lot of fraud in
you know
i should have tried harder but a lot of
fraud got in there
so maybe we should change some things
and get rid of people like me
you know it turns out i was the weak
link i admit it i confess i confess
nobody asked
before if they had asked before i would
have said
but now that you've asked i guess it was
me and i i mismanaged everything it was
full of fraud
no nobody will ever say that
no matter what happened in the part they
managed
they're gonna tell you
i nailed it
you should hire me again
i should definitely do this again yeah i
nailed it
so
um russia is cutting off the rail lines
surrounding the ukraine military
so
at least the part of the ukraine
military that's fighting in the those
most contested regions there
it looks like there's a good chance that
russia is going to cut them off their
supply chains
and strangle them
now
you have to think that the ukrainians
are aware of this
and would have some kind of response or
they would strategically withdraw to a
more defensive position or something or
something i don't know
but i don't trust any reporting coming
out of there but it does look like the
end game is going to be russia controls
that part of
what used to be ukraine
and then they'll negotiate that's my
guess
did you all see the clip i think this
was also on yeah it was on tucker
carlson
a clip of candace owens
trying to uh knock on the door and get a
uh
an interview or talk to somebody at the
black lives matter
so-called mansion that was purchased
with money that people donated to black
lives matter
and i guess uh
blm's co-founder colors
now what do
i mean seriously what are the odds that
the founder of black lives matter or the
one that's most famous anyway that her
last name was that would actually be
colors
like that's her actual name colors
and she ends up being in charge of an
organization that's
mostly about our callers
i don't know that seemed weird to me
but anyway
the funny part of this and you have to
see this clip
so you can see it in my twitter feed or
just
google it candice owens and
blm
and so
you see
ms cullers
the blm founder
i guess sobbing would be the rest best
word or
very emotional uh crying i i guess you'd
say
um as she emotionally described how
threatened she feeled she felt
when her i guess where she lived was
assaulted
as the way she might describe it
and that i i think she has children or
something
and so she was quite worried and and
concerned
and then on tucker show he would
intersperse it with the actual uh video
of candace owens politely
ringing the doorbell and asking if
anybody's home
the nicest person in the world
now you'd have to know
that
candace owens when she's doing her you
know debating
online
she's you know sort of a pit bull
so so if you think of her as a pit bull
you you're missing maybe the bigger part
of the story that makes it funny
in person
she's one of the warmest people you'll
ever meet
like she's just immediately
so warm
right i had the pleasure of meeting her
once
and
uh so her
her public persona
is tough
just the way you'd want it to be
but her private is just so warm and you
see more the the private version of her
ringing the doorbell
the kind that when you hear her voice
you think to yourself well that's a nice
person
because she is
as far as i can tell i mean from my
brief encounter
and oh
uh
yes
problem solved
problem solved all right
so
you just have to see the uh
see the clip it's it's a wonderful uh
juxtaposition of uh somebody acting nice
and polite and somebody acting like
they've been attacked
all right i made this claim on twitter
that obesity is an information problem
not a willpower problem
do you believe that i can make that
claim stick do you think that i can
persuade you in the next i don't know 10
minutes
that
obesity is an information problem
primarily
oh you some of you have too much faith
in me
well i will i am going to convince you
if you were not convinced but i'm
surprised that you know i can
because i probably wouldn't have tried
unless i knew i could
all right so the few of you who are
um
let's say doubting that i can do it
let me start now remember
i'm trying to persuade you
so if you don't mind
i will tell you how i'm persuading you
as i do it
is that fair
because otherwise
it could be a little heavy-handed
so i'm going to tell you what i'm doing
so you can opt out you know if you don't
want to be persuaded
just don't watch
so the first thing i'm going to do
is i'm going to convince you that i'm
qualified for the conversation
and so the first thing i needed to do
to do that
is to prove that i use my own techniques
and i'm not obese
all right so this is
this is my
shirtless torso
it's a recent picture so that's what i
look like at age i'm turning 65 and
not too long a few days
so
at age 65
that's what i look like
i know it's a it's a geraldo problem
right at a certain age nobody wants to
see you without a shirt i get it i get
it
but all i'm trying to demonstrate
is that i use i use the method i'm going
to teach you
and that it works here's the second
thing
i wrote a best-selling book
within it is a
chapter which people talk about all the
time
which is how to fix their diet and
fitness
now
so i've researched it wrote a book
used the techniques you can see the
techniques on me and then since the book
came out a number of years ago
i have the benefit of the feedback
so people have told me i've lost 80
pounds i've lost 60 pounds
a lot of them
a lot of people told me this right
so now you see that i've researched it i
wrote a bestselling book on it i used
the technique and you can see the
results again i'm not i'm not saying i
should be on the cover of a magazine i'm
saying that
just using the techniques works for me
that's not enough
to persuade you
so i'm going to say it worked for lots
of other people so now you know there's
some social proof
that is persuasion
now
for the final argument
let's make sure you can all see this
and it goes like this
um
most of you
or i think most people believe that they
understand how diet works if i said to
you what is a good good thing to eat
versus a bad thing
you'd say well a bad thing might be
chocolate cake
and a good thing might be broccoli
and i would say a plus
you nailed it you know something about
diet if i said to you is it better to
eat more calories or fewer all things be
equal nutrition wise
probably say fewer fewer if you're
trying to lose weight or maintain weight
maybe
so
you would probably get most things right
in fact i would say on the scale of no
knowledge about diet to
knowing everything that the most
knowledgeable person in the world knows
you would be way up there
like way better than the uninformed
but one thing that you and the
uninformed probably have in common
now again when i say you i don't really
mean every one of you right
some of you know more than i do
some of you no less so you're all over
the board but just allow me to speak in
general terms for simplicity if you
don't mind
i'm going to say that you this is the
hypothetical you not specifically you
might be damn near a genius about diet
and what you and the people who don't
know a damn thing about diet have in
common
is obesity
because knowing a lot
knowing a lot about diet doesn't do you
damn good it doesn't help
you have to get to the point
where you really do know more than other
people like you really really know more
and here's what i mean by more
more about how the brain works
it's not good enough to know what has
more calories
it's not good enough to know that
packaged stuff might be worse for you
than fresh stuff
it's not good enough to know that
organic might be better for you than
non-organic
most people in the general public know
all of that stuff
i'm talking about the stuff i'm going to
teach you
how many people know this
that's the final say 10 percent
that's the 10
that allows you to maintain your weight
lose weight
manage it completely
and you have to know number one
that will power is imaginary
there's no such thing as willpower
willpower is just something that is sort
of a result it's more like seeing the
end of the race
right it doesn't tell you what was
happening it's just how you interpret it
after the fact oh i didn't have enough
willpower
if you're trying to use your willpower
in other words increase the amount of
suffering you're willing to take right
because that would be you know a rough
definition of willpower
how much suffering are you willing to
take now
for some longer-term gain which you
understand intellectually but you're not
getting that benefit right now
that's willpower right if that's what
you're trying to use you're probably
obese
because it doesn't work
your brain will eventually find a way to
talk you out of hurting it
this is one of the most important things
you'll ever hear in your life
if you do something that hurts yourself
such as give yourself some current
discomfort
your brain will find a way
to make you too busy to do that anymore
it will it will injure some other part
of your body so you can't do it it will
give you a trauma that makes you
distracted so you won't do it your brain
will talk you out of pain
it will make you go somewhere where
you're not getting that pain
so if if if
hurting yourself is how you're trying to
maintain your good health it won't work
it won't work in the long run
all right
so you're gonna have to ma you're gonna
have to master the mental part of diet
which is way beyond just what you eat
if what you eat and when is the only
thing you're working with you're not
even close to enough knowledge to
maintain your weight
all right here's just uh here's just a
uh
a flavor of it if you wanted the bigger
picture of how to create a system that's
in this book kind of failed almost
everything and still win big
so i'm going to hit the high points just
to make the argument
that information
is is what you need
not willpower right so but that the
details of what information you need
there still will be more than what you
see here
number one what i call the pleasure unit
theory
is the observation
that people need a certain amount of
pleasure in their life
if you had no pleasure in your life
whatsoever but you could eat a
cheeseburger
nothing's going to stop you
that's a bit of knowledge that maybe you
didn't know
you do not have willpower
if you don't have other pleasure in your
life
you need a certain amount of enjoyment
or you will just
kill yourself
right you you will injure yourself
slowly or fast but you will not put up
with no pleasure in your life you can't
do it
so
somebody who has no hope of any normal
kind of pleasure maybe they've become
drug users
unfortunately it makes it easier right
if you have no other pleasure in your
life but you have food
how much food are you gonna eat a lot so
the first thing you need to know is that
you've got to find a way to get your
whole life under control
that's what will help your diet
if you have dating options
it's easier to go on a diet
because you say to yourself you know
if i go on a diet i'm going to feel
better look better have better sex
because i have all these options
all i have to do is lose some weight
but i suppose you didn't think you had
any options
you're going to eat
because what else you got going
so the first thing you need to know is
this piece of knowledge
your diet is not about your diet it's
about pleasure
you need to get pleasure and you got to
find a way to get it maybe you learn to
enjoy a sport that you also get exercise
maybe you fix your social life maybe you
fix your dating life maybe you break up
with somebody who's toxic you need to
fix something
to get more pleasure or you don't have a
chance
working on your diet
because it's just an easy way to get
pleasure
number two you can manage cravings if
you think that how much you like a
specific food is sort of baked into your
dna then you have a knowledge problem
you don't have a willpower problem you
have a knowledge problem
did you know for example that certain
simple carbs will make you hungrier
if you were eating poor simple carbs
let's say you know white rice and
potatoes and white bread
those are great things like i love love
those things they are addictive
the more of those you eat the more of
those you want did you know that
did you know that if you simply cut out
let's say one food that's a problem food
but didn't change anything else in your
diet you would have limited the amount
of pain to basically imperceptible
so for example when i want to get rid of
one
problem food in my diet
sometimes i
i get addicted to snickers candy bars
i go through like a cycle where i have
to have to weed myself off them
all i have to do
is make sure i eat everything else that
i'm still eating the same amount so i'm
never
never hungry because i'm still just
eating
like always it's just that one thing i
don't do
and then it's easy
you know i think about it when i want it
so i'd sure like that two months later
and it's about two months
the thought of having a snickers candy
bar sounds a little bit gross
and even if i were to taste one i'd be
like i don't even know why i like these
before
it was true with diet coke it was true
with a whole bunch of problem foods
so if you only take one problem food at
a time
and make sure that you're getting
pleasure in different places
you won't even notice
that you've replaced that one food with
something that's a little bit healthier
so that's a knowledge
knowing that you can change your
cravings
by these micro substitutions is
knowledge it's not willpower it takes
away the need for willpower
knowing that willpower is imaginary is
probably the most important thing
because if you're working on changing
your cravings or or upping your
knowledge you're doing the right thing
if you if you're trying to
let's say you had squirrels in the attic
but you thought you had ghosts
because you hear the noise in the attic
if you hire a ghostbuster
no matter how many times they tell you
they've cleared your house of ghosts
you're still going to hear the stuff in
the attic because it wasn't ghosts
if you're trying to lose weight with
this thing called willpower you're
putting all your energy in the wrong
place
so it helps just to know it doesn't
exist
so that you know to look somewhere else
it sounds sounds like a small point but
it's actually the biggest point
if you believe this is real
that you're waiting for santa claus
and it doesn't matter how long you wait
santa claus isn't coming because he's
not real sorry if anybody didn't know
that
all right number four uh figuring out
how to find flavor
did you know that the way you slice
something will completely change how you
perceive it
enjoyment wise i've done this experiment
a number of times i've done it on camera
as well
in which you can take just a cauliflower
now i know some of you don't like
cauliflower so just work with me that
this is just an example if you were to
take a chunk of cauliflower and try to
take a bite out of it it would not be
very satisfying if you took that same
cauliflower
sliced it thin
smooshed it into some salt and pepper on
a breadboard
and then ate it
it would be like a delicious chip
that happened to be
maybe a little too much salt but the
point is you can take things that aren't
delicious
and turn them into something delicious
fairly easily
many of you have seen my avocado
example
where instead of making guacamole and
eating a bunch of chips and stuff that
would you know cause you to you know
just pack on the calories i take a
regular avocado slice in half take out
the pit
just
score it with a
knife so it's easy to scoop out put some
soy sauce and pepper on it and just eat
it directly
it's delicious
but if you just took like a i don't know
a spoonful
of avocado and just ate it
you might like it some people i mean i
could do that but
it's not gonna be delicious so how do
you find things that are generally good
for you now avocado has a lot of
calories but it's a good kind of fat if
you didn't know that that was a
disadvantage right but most of you knew
that
did you know that eating peanuts even
though they're fat
is highly correlated with losing weight
because some kinds of fats
are very satiating and even though you
take a hit on calories while you're
eating them
they cause you not to want to eat for a
longer period of time than you otherwise
would have
did you know that
did you know that sometimes when you're
sleepy
your brain
interprets it as hunger do you ever have
those days where you just can't stop
eating
you don't know why it's like why am i so
hungry today well usually you're eating
simple carbs that's part of it it's
making you hungrier as you eat but the
other part is maybe you're tired
and that's making you feel hungry did
you know that
now suppose you knew everything that i
mentioned
if you read my book you might have known
muslim
you can see now how many people didn't
know those things right
did have i mentioned anything yet
that you said oh i didn't know that
probably
probably because i'm talking about the
stuff that people in the top
i don't know five percent
no not the people who are in the top
90 percent you know the top the people
who were way smarter than the average
they don't know that stuff
that you got to get yet another level up
and then everything's easy
and the the level up is not willpower
it's just knowledge
and you're you're almost there now
all right here's some more so experiment
continually with the shape and cut and
flavor uh find find out how to add a
lemon and pepper and
soy sauce or whatever to your food
because they they can make stuff
delicious without adding a lot of
calories
learn how to reframe
how many of you know how to reframe
well you sort of know what i'm talking
about but not really let me give you a
specific example
i've reframed alcohol
to be poison
meaning that when i think of alcohol
just mentally i think oh alcohol is
poison
and it makes it easier not to imbibe it
because i just talked myself into it not
being a beverage it's not really a
beverage
you know it's not entertainment it's
poison
now i shared that technique
not knowing that it would make any
difference to anyone else and i can't
tell you how many people have come back
and said i completely took alcohol out
of my life now i'm not talking about
addicts
i'm not talking about alcoholics i'm
only talking about people who had too
much alcohol in their life and wanted
less
and a whole bunch of people say you know
i lost weight
i gave up alcohol and it was primarily
just that reframe
just calling it poison just in your own
mind and that's it
now if you don't think you can reprogram
your own brain
to change your preferences and that's
what that was
that's a reframe that changes your
preference
from alcohol as entertainment to whoa
why would i drink
poison it is that simple it's just focus
and repetition
that's all it takes to
end association really association
repetition and focus what can reprogram
your but your brain so in that reframe
example
it associates alcohol with poison that's
the association part
you focus on it
because otherwise you know nothing
happens and then you repeat it
that's it
that's the entire technique
did you know that
well most of you are not hypnotists
most of you have not studied persuasion
enough to know that it is that simple
that that little reframe should work
doesn't mean it'll work for everybody
right and everybody's individual but
yeah
yeah that little reframe can completely
reprogram a preference
i reprogrammed my preferences for
snickers candy bars my preference for
diet coke i got that in my life i
reprogrammed my preference for
a whole bunch of stuff
and it's all doable and you can too and
that little reframe is just one way to
do it there are lots of ways to do it
that's just one way
so simply knowing that you could reframe
things and change your preferences is
big knowing that it's technique
and the technique is continuously
experimenting with different flavors and
foods continuously learning and
continuously experimenting with
reprogramming your own preferences so
that's the technique part if you knew
hypnosis this would all be more obvious
and if you understood a system
versus goal approach which is really the
macro theme of my how to fill book
if you understood that then you would be
able to work your way into the knowledge
on your own
in other words
if you knew systems versus goals
i wouldn't have had to tell you any of
this
you would have already been exploring
your own systems and you would have
ended up in the same place
now
that is my presentation
my and this is based on an observation i
made years ago
i would go out to eat with friends
and everybody would order whatever they
were ordering and you could look at the
plates of the people
and the
you can see that the types of food they
ate
was perfectly correlated with my
subjective opinion of their knowledge of
diet
like the more they knew
the more likely they had a certain kind
of food and the less they knew about
diet
the more they had other other kind of
food and i thought that can't be a
coincidence
it can't be a coincidence that the
knowledge
is the thing it feels like you should be
the willpower right
and then eventually you learn that
willpower is not really a thing
it's a way you rationalize something
after the fact it's the way you perceive
it
it's a subjective interpretation of
what's happening
it's just not real
you can't pick up a handful of it
you can't get a bucket of willpower
i can't give it to you
here's my final argument for why
willpower isn't real
because you have it in some topics and
not in others
if willpower were real
consistently the people who have it
would be able to resist everything
doesn't work that way
the people who can resist eating
are recklessly drinking
or having too much you know reckless sex
or something
but people tend to
be able to resist to some things and not
others it's not because they have
willpower about one thing
if they had willpower they'd probably
just have willpower
but what we have is different urges
my urge for certain vices let's say
alcohol i've never had a great urge for
alcohol i've enjoyed it in the past i
don't do it now
but i never had a great urge for it
if i did
i probably would do more of it
right and i would say oh i didn't have
enough willpower but it wasn't there was
no willpower i just had a greater urge
so once you understand that
people's
actions are based on just they're
operating on greater urges
and some urges are greater than others
then you understand everything willpower
isn't real now you say to yourself but
scott
what about the people who can say i'll
give up something today
to get something better in the future
isn't that pure willpower
to which i say
nope
because i can change it with information
here's some information
hypothetically i'll take a picture of
you today
i'll digitally age it to your future
and then i'll show you a picture of
yourself in the future not too happy
about the choices you made today
and it will reprogram you
it's information
i didn't change your willpower
i changed your information by allowing
you to imagine
what you would look like reasonably
reasonably you would look like if you
continue the path you're on
some people can't imagine
as easily what that's going to look like
and then bring that pain to today
i appear to have willpower
but i think i have better imagination
in other words i can really really
imagine myself suffering in the future
for a decision i make today like i can i
can bring that imagination to the future
i can bring it all the way into my
stomach today
i don't think most people can do that
is that willpower
no no it's just imagination
and i can get you to imagine better as
well
just tell you to focus on it i'm doing
it right now
let's do it right now watch me do this
and it won't change your willpower one
bit i'm just going to change what you
focused on for a moment
imagine yourself in the future
10 years from now
the difference is did you allow your
weight to get under control or keep it
under control or did you maintain a good
weight today
now imagine yourself 10 years from now
you're barely walking up the stairs
your your sex life is gone
your self-esteem gone your energy gone
just imagine it that's you 10 years from
now if you up now
if you if you stick that whatever that
thing is in front of you if you put that
in your face and you chew it you put it
in your stomach and you keep doing that
that's you
just imagine it
right now i'm done
that's it
that was technique
did i change your willpower nope
because willpower never existed i
couldn't change what doesn't exist did i
change your knowledge
yes
not in a scientific way but i added to
your current understanding
a little bit extra
about what future you could look like
under two different scenarios
and that
little bit of information that you
brought forward into your present
change what you know
how you process it what you focus on
and in a very small way
some of you just got a boost
so that's technique
so
i rest my case
obesity
is an information problem
that we imagine to be a power problem
does anybody have
any pushback
no
because you're all convinced
it turns out i'm good at this
[Laughter]
all right on that note i'm going to end
it here because i i want you to
think about this as the last thing at
the end of this
this live stream
because that'll keep it in your mind a
little bit longer all right just keep it
in your mind
just keep the frame
willpower doesn't exist
if you increase your information
you can get what you want just increase
your information
experiment
experiment experiment
that's all for today
bye for now youtube
