do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
there's never been a fighter moment in
the entire world
now
if you were watching me uh on the locals
platform
I have about 25
things that have to work right within a
10 minute Span in order for this to go
live so I've got five different lights
and I've got you know different devices
and microphones and and each of them
have software that needs to be updated
and you know there's tweets that need to
go out and I'd have problems with the
tweeting so of the 25 things that needed
to work
probably seven of them did not work
today
that's a lot so it's kind of a miracle
that you're even you're even listening
to me at the moment however if you'd
like to take this experience up to the
maximum possible experience
all you need
is a couple of Margaret glass a tanker
Chelsea Stein a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee enjoy this
now for the unparalleled pleasure it's a
dopa being there the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called
that's right the simultaneous sip yeah
ah
that's good
did I see somebody say that RFK Jr is
anti-nuclear energy
is that a thing I just saw that in the
comments I'm having trouble believing
that's true
I don't think that's true all right I'm
going to call that yeah I'm going to
call that not true
but what is true
what many interesting things are true
well in Indiana there's a
adult white male councilman or running
for councilman in Indiana who has
decided to identify as a woman of color
so now he's an indian-american woman
and the news is giving him a hard time
because the news doesn't think he's
serious
no they think that he's just mocking the
system
what I don't believe that I believe that
if he wants to identify as a woman of
color he has every right to do it and
the News better treat him with respect
Embrace and amplify Ryan Webb who may or
may not be watching this
that's some good uh dad humor there I
don't know if he's a dad
but identifying as a woman of color
while he runs for office in his local
community is a very much a dad joke
it's very much a dad joke
all right here's a little story there
was an Vice
uh I guess uh
actually they reported it but originally
it was a Rachel newer for PBS Nova so
they did this study and found that
I guess I didn't even know this was a
stereotype but did you know that long
ago
there was a stereotype that Southerners
were lazy and not in a racial way but
just Southerners in general
I guess I wasn't even aware of that that
was some kind of stereotype but it turns
out that there's a scientific reason for
it
it turns out that 40 percent of the
people after you know right after
slavery they had hookworm
and hookworm makes you exhausted
so apparently hookworm was just you know
all over the place in the South because
it you know the weather the weather
supports it
so it wasn't a big problem in the North
so the Northerners are just you know
working up and you know they're just
doing their own work
but this others apparently needed slaves
because they're also damn lazy and
exhausted all the time it's like ah I
can't pick any cotton myself do you have
any ideas
no I'm too tired too I can't pick any
Cottons I'm full of hookworms well think
creatively what can we do in the South
here when we got this Plantation and
we're all too tired to pick the cotton
ourselves
hey I've got an idea and then everything
went bad after that so
I blame the hookworm for all of her
problems and
if I may be the first to suggest this
I believe the hookworms should be paying
reparations to all of us because that's
where it all started now I'm just making
that up don't Don Lemon me I know I know
I'm making that up it's just made up
all right
so there's that
here's my favorite story of the day but
is also the smallest story of the day or
is it or is it is it the biggest story
of the day or is it the smallest one you
decide
it turns out that
um the community notes feature on
Twitter where Twitter will allow other
users to essentially fact check a tweet
them Twitter I I just if you don't know
this story I'm just going to say it
slowly
so that you can appreciate the beauty
and pageantry of it all I'll just state
it slowly
today I think it was today might have
been yesterday
Twitter
use Community notes
to fact check
an advertisement on its own platform
[Laughter]
my God
they fact check an advertisement they
fact check their own advertisers they
fact Jack people who are paying them
not they I mean it's the community that
does it not the Twitter employees
but uh I saw somebody tweet about it and
then Elon Musk uh tweeted back that the
the goal is to make this platform
maximum truth seeking or said another
way the least untrue compared to
everything else
now the first thing I love about that
love love love is he's very consistent
musk is about not saying that he's going
to have the truth
I love that because that's so honest
well I'm not going to have the truth I'm
just going to be less lying than the
other platforms if I work at it really
hard
that seems so
perfectly honest that I just love that
framing
and apparently that that applies to
advertisements
so it was a Regal theater advertisement
and I don't I don't think they were
necessarily doing anything sketchy The
Advertiser I think it was just there was
something unclear
you know it made it look a little better
than it was let's call that marketing
but they got called on that and they had
they got fact checked I love that
um and that makes me wonder about musk's
AI
uh which he also talks about being
maximum truth seeking but now he's also
talking about Twitter
being maximum truth seeking does that
mean that Ai and Twitter will become one
or are they just coincidentally both
described by their owners as maximum
truth seeking
maybe that's just equality once in all
of his work I don't know
um
but it makes me think that at least
mentally
he imagines those two things well if I
may
I love Venn diagrams
have I told you how much I love Venn
diagrams everybody laughs at me because
I love them I love Venn diagrams
list of circles this is your circles and
then the the Twitter is like in the
circle of the AI possibly he he I love
the Venn diagrams
that looked completely natural and
normal didn't it
you know it's a good thing that we don't
have a major politician who talks like
that
Polaris outcomes
all right
um
I almost thought this was a joke
but apparently it's not the CDC is
renewing its recommendation for
travelers into the U.S to be vaccinated
before they can get in
that's with covet
that's a real thing that's happening in
the actual world
what what
it's April 30th 2023. well is there some
kind of like Wormhole into the past that
just opened
what the hell
at the same time as this story
Pfizer is going to ask the FDA to allow
a third coven shot for healthy 5 to 11
year olds
based on the study of 140 kids
what is going on what is going on
are we in some kind of a weird bubble
where this makes sense and we don't know
is happening
we can't rule that out right so one of
the things you always have to think is
maybe everything maybe everyone else is
right
right maybe the cdc's right and I don't
I don't see it but
at the very least this this deserves a
little more explaining doesn't it a
little more explaining of why this is
even possibly on the table why why is it
even in the conversation
well obviously money but
how are we taking this seriously
even musk said that the CDC
decision about the vaccinations for
coming into this country you should be
mocked he said it was worthy of mocking
now apparently the only way we can run
the country now is by mocking stupid
 until it's too embarrassing for our
leaders to do it
that apparently is what's left right you
know you used to think oh my second
amendment I'll use my second amendment
to keep the government in line well
that's not working
what else you got how about voting oh
I'll vote
well well
uh
so what do you got you're just mocking
mocking is the only thing we have left
so let's mock the hell out of this
um
I saw a story with Wall Street Journal I
guess that the US is trying to set up a
crisis hotline with China
and China's you know not too interested
and here's the part that made me go what
we don't already have a crisis
highlighted with China
what
how in the world do we not have a crisis
hotline with China
or to put it another way
do we really not have President xi's
cell phone
I mean I assume he has one probably an
aide walks around with it or something
but I feel like we should literally have
his cell phone
like you know in his AIDS pocket or
whatever we should be able to we should
be able to get a hold of President XI
in five minutes
and vice versa don't you think don't you
think she should be able to reach Biden
on the phone like actually his actual
voice in five minutes or less no matter
what
how in the world does that not already
exist I mean it's blowing my mind
we've had it for Russia forever has
never been bad
correct me if I'm wrong
but the crisis line to the to the
Kremlin has actually been used has it
not
because somebody could be a fact check
on that have we not actually used
yeah back in the Soviet days right we've
actually used the hotline haven't we
I'm not positive about that I think we
have
Beyond testing it
Cuban Missile Crisis
yeah or was it after that I don't know I
don't know my history on that but we
need it all right well Trump has decided
on his nickname for Biden
I'm a little undecided on this one but
in his typical Trump fashion
he uh he described it this way
and every time I hear a trumpet
paragraph of something he actually said
I miss him
and nobody talks like he does he's the
only one in the world who talks like
Trump and when he talks you think you're
hearing somebody talk for the first time
it's like an alien came down and and
said stuff that you could understand but
you don't know why
all right here's what Trump says I guess
he said this in
Manchester yesterday I will be retiring
the name crooked from Hillary Clinton
Trump said I'm going to give her a new
name uh I don't know like maybe lovely
Hillary or beautiful Hillary
but I'm going to retire the name crooked
so that we can use the name for uh Joe
Joe Biden because he'll be known from
now on as crooked Joe Biden
Crook and Joe Biden what do you think
now
the
it feels a little recycled
it feels recycled however it does show
that that's going to be his primary
attack
Factor so it looks like Trump is
announcing that his you know his big
push will be on Biden's
you know potential illegalities
now does that make sense given that
Trump himself is accused of big
illegalities so he's got some law he's
got a lawsuit and some other legal
Jeopardy
do you like the fact that he's going at
Biden for the thing that Trump is most
accused of which is having some criminal
guilt
it is projecting
but I would argue that it did work with
Hillary
because remember one of the big uh
problems that people had with Trump is
they thought he was just running for the
money the first time
in the first election they thought he's
you know just in front of money and he's
got all these crooked deals that they
never found and he must have things on
his taxes that are terrible that they
never found
so Trump was being
accused of you know Russia collusion all
manner of things crooked
for money
and so he just took uh took that attack
and escalated at times 10 for her so if
you were going to vote on that dimension
you'd have some confusion you know if
you thought that voting for the honest
one was what you wanted to do well he
put a lot of confusion in there well
maybe maybe I am the honest one
relatively speaking
so I don't know
I I guess I'm disappointed that it's a
recycled name
but I can't disagree that it might blunt
one of the biggest attacks against Trump
himself
however let's dig a Little Deeper
as Politico noted
it turns out that Joe Biden has a big
Advantage with old people
do you know why old people like Joe
Biden
because he's old
probably probably because he's old
and people like anybody who's sort of
like themselves so
um if Biden has let's say the Mind share
of the old people it would be very tough
for Trump to win because Trump used to
be the one who got the old people
so Trump's biggest or one of his biggest
election advantages is that old people
like him
older the better for Trump
but that's also true for Biden the older
the better in terms of them like him
so what would strategy would you use
this will be a little persuasion test
for you if you knew that you had to win
the old people
and you weren't doing it and you're
Trump and you got to get the old people
back into your side
how would you persuade old people go
fear got it in the first try fear yeah
fear is the number one lever when you're
trying to scare old people
because the old people are just like
don't change anything too much
you know I'm still alive
I got this far just don't change
anything too much don't don't do any big
moves don't do anything that would shake
the boat because I'm not really able to
recover at this point
from this point on you know I'm already
80 years old I kind of need things just
to go the way they are don't don't rock
that boat for me
so I think that
um Trump's best argument for the old is
that Biden is risky
have you heard me say that before
so risky is what Bill Clinton used to
defeat
um uh
uh what's his name Bob Dole
so when Bob Dole was considered
you know pretty old
um
Bill Clinton used risky
as a way to get the old people to say
wait a minute we like Bob Dole because
he's old and he's at World War II
greatest Generation we like all that but
what's this about risky
and then suddenly
suddenly if you think it's risky
for Biden then you don't like it at all
so one of the things that Trump has
going for him is that he is not wanting
to cut Social benefits for old people
that's pretty big
and that's not necessarily what every
Republican would say
um
bankrupt button no I think I think you
want to say Biden is going to take your
money
see I don't think old old people are
necessarily worried about Street crimes
so much they probably just get used to
it or they don't live around it
and I don't think they're worried about
the war in Ukraine because it looks like
it's
you know limited over there
the one thing that old people worry
about is if they lose their money
they can't make it back because they're
old if you're young and you lose your
money to inflation at least you think
well I've got time to adjust and I can
figure something out but if you're old
and all the money you have is all the
money you'll ever have listen let's just
say this imagine Trump saying
if you're above a certain age and you're
retired
all the money you have now is all the
money you'll ever have
Biden wants to take a third of it every
year or you make up some hyperbolic
number yet your your net wealth is going
to go down by 10 a year every year that
Biden is in office or something
so
I believe that Trump needs to scare old
people about their finances which by the
way would not be unethical in my opinion
I believe it would be unethical
to scare somebody about something that
they should not be scared about would
you agree using fear that's fake like
there's not really anything to worry
about but you make people afraid of it
that's that's pretty sketchy but if
something is genuinely a problem and you
really should be afraid of it that's
completely ethical
because you have to tell people the
truth this is a really big problem if
you don't see it you're gonna get
stuck in the back
all right
so
um
here's something that I've said before
but I love this idea and if somebody
some Republican could figure out how to
execute this it would be amazing
and what it would be is
a show an ongoing show
in which they deprogram Democrats
now to be fair you're going to say but
Scott you could do the same thing with
Republicans you could have a show where
you're deprogramming them from the crazy
Q related stuff they believe and that's
true
absolutely true you could take any
citizen and they need to be deprogrammed
yeah the number of citizens that don't
need to be deprogrammed it's a pretty
small number
but for a purely political reasons if
you're a republican you wanted to win
you should start a series with some kind
of a serious host in serious production
values and about once a week you produce
a small video in which you show some
Democrats who believe the news
do you feel me you should you feature a
couple of Democrats maybe just one or
three or something who believe the news
and you put them in the room with
whoever the host is but here's the fun
part
you have a known Democrat fact checker
somebody who is unquestionably totally a
Democrat
and they are the fact Checkers for their
Democrat friend and so you say look
it's perfectly reasonable to have a
different opinion about what we should
do
and I'm not even going to be talking
about the opinion of what we should do
that will not even be our topic today
we're simply going to figure out what's
true and what isn't and then you can
make up your own mind so you believe
that
this or that is true
here's your own Democrat fact Checker
who's going to show you the source right
in front of you you can look at it right
here and show you that what you've been
told is not true
and then just Watch What Happens
right then you probably want to have
somebody uh it depends if it gets funny
Don Lemon that'd be funny uh well you
need somebody who's genuinely an
absolute Democrat
but it'd be hard to get anybody willing
to do that right
so do you know the the street interviews
where there's a young man I can't
remember his name I wish I did where he
asked people on the street simple
questions about the United States
and just simple questions about anything
one of the questions is uh how many
hours in uh in a 24-hour day
is questions like that and you're
watching people like hours how many
hours in the 24-hour day you watch them
like thinking it's like
hours and then they're thinking it's a
trick question
12. 12. and then whatever they say no
matter how wrong it is the interviewer
will go right
and that's the end of it and he doesn't
you know one after another and every
time you see somebody say the dumbest
thing you've ever seen in your life and
you see the interviewer go right it just
makes you laugh every time so the
Republicans should have a show like that
where let me give you one example
you bring somebody on you say Do you
think the 2022 election was rigged they
would have they would of course say no
or the 2020 election they would of
course say no
then you say uh do you know that that's
a fact
that it would of course say yes
then you say what what would be you know
your basis for that fact they'd probably
say well the courts looked at it and
everybody looked at it and they found
nothing of substance
and then you have a Democrat explain to
them this would be good dershowitz would
be perfect oh my God Alan dershowitz
I I doubt he would do it but he'd be
perfect for it to just explain to them
well you know the absence of looking for
something is completely different from
knowing it's not there
and just watch what happens
is somebody going to argue that that's
wrong is going to say is anybody can say
no you're wrong Allen dershowitz by not
looking for something
and therefore not finding it I can know
that it doesn't exist
and you wouldn't even have to correct
him it would just be so funny to watch
right the hard part would be you could
never find anybody to host the show and
be that fact Checker all right
but what would be awesome about that is
if you got people to concentrate on the
fact checking they would have
uncritically uh by them have
sort of accidentally accepted that fact
checking needs to happen
so it's really a trick
you you would think the focus would be
on the show itself
and the specific facts getting checked
that's what people would talk about but
if you can get them to talk about
whether the fact check was correct
they've already accepted uncritically
the Democrats have to be deprogrammed
do you get that
the real the real win is just putting in
people's mind that there's some
deprogramming that has to happen because
the news has been such a
such a failure
well it is true I am a Democrat but I
don't think I would have that
credibility needed
all right um
here's something uh interesting
so Robert RFK Jr the running for
president and
how many people made news this weekend
because RFK Jr made news
three or four times
in one weekend
you you can you can feel the the energy
shift
I hear all the things that
first of all uh RFK Jr was on ABC News
and ABC news said when they were done
they said we edited out some things he
said about vaccinations
and then RFK Jr comes back and he says
there's some law 47 USC 315 makes it
illegal it's actually illegal for TV
networks to censor presidential
candidates
but ABC not only did it but they bragged
about it
they bragged about it they said yes we
censored it because he said some stuff
we don't want you to see they actually
said it they said it right out loud
it's against the law
for exactly this reason
this is the reason it's against the law
oh yeah Disney owns an ABC thank you for
that yes so Disney's fighting with
Republicans and DeSantis and then a
Disney owned property ABC tells you
tells the viewers that they've censored
part of a presidential candidate because
they didn't like that part of what he
said
amazing so that's the first time uh says
one time the RFK Jr made news this
weekend
he also announced he opposes biological
males competing in women's sports
now that's a pretty gutsy take for uh
Democrats isn't it
so he's very clearly saying I'm
let's say a classic Democrat
as opposed to the super Progressive
walksters now I don't know all of RFK
Jr's opinions on stuff
so I want to be as clear as possible if
I'm saying positive things about them
the context is his ability as a
Persuader
all right you got that so I'm not I'm
not agreeing with policies or disagree
with them I'm just saying that like
Trump he's got something extra going on
super persuasive and you can see it
right away right so the other thing the
bad news is Bill Maher said he was
impressed that RFK Jr was already
pulling at 19 percent
do you realize that that's just about
what
DeSantis is polling against Trump
how many of you are thinking that
DeSantis is a totally legitimate you
know valid Challenger to Trump
but he has almost the same
you know bite on Trump as RFK Jr does on
Biden but everybody's talking like RFK
Junior doesn't have that much of a
chance
but that but this answers does but
they're polling about the same 21 versus
19 or something
so
there's definitely an energy shift
um
I saw David sacks saying some good
things about RFK Jr that RFK Jr took as
an endorsement I'm not sure I didn't see
the endorsement but that's what he said
so that's huge if you don't know who
David Sachs is you would be one of the
handful of what I call the internet dads
and I'll I'll say the internet dad is
somebody who's not driven by a political
party
team play
somebody who's just going to say whoa
whoa whoa that's too far oh actually
that would be a good way to say it the
the internet dads are the ones who are
telling you when things went too far
okay that's too far
that is too far right so that's what
David sacks being among the I don't know
top five people who are good at that
sort of thing so he's not going to take
a side he's just going to look at what
seems to make sense go that way so the
the few people who can do that are like
uh the most valuable assets at the
moment in the country
all right so
who else who else made news three times
this weekend
you can feel it can't you
you can feel it now what I expect is
there are going to be some really tough
uh opposition research about RFK Jr so
in all likelihood you're going to hear
some horrible things about him
don't assume they're true
I mean they might be I don't know I I
have no idea one way or the other but
don't assume they're true you're just
going to hear some really bad stuff uh
just assume assume you will
all right
um
here's something that answered all of my
questions about Epstein so there's new
reporting from The Wall Street Journal I
saw this on the Owen Gregorian tweet
thank you Owen for sending me good stuff
in the mornings and
so we know that Jeffrey Epstein's
private calendar
showed meetings with CIA director
William Burns Goldman Sachs top lawyer
Noam Chomsky some other people
but can you tell me why CI director
William Burns would have a private
meeting actually more than one private
meeting with Jeffrey Epstein
can you think of any reason that that
would make sense
well
unfortunately we can we can think of a
few reasons now it wouldn't make sense
for the CIA director
to be working a source what it like I
don't think the director of the CIA you
know works with an agent on the field or
anything like that but Epstein wasn't
like that he was it was more like a
high-end operator so it probably does
make sense in my opinion
that's as close as you can get to a
confirmation that Epstein was working
with the CIA
which would explain everything
would it not
it would literally explain everything
now my guess is that he was working with
more than the CIA
meaning that the CIA might have been
concerned that he was working for
somebody else and maybe he was at the
same time and maybe he wasn't working
with anybody except himself
but working for himself
meant having Connections in blackmail
and you know networking with all kinds
of sketchy Intel people yeah so
I'm willing to say that I now know what
happened
in the in a broad sense how many would
you agree
uh
how many would you agree would you agree
how many of you would agree that
whatever Epstein was he was also an
Intel asset
for somebody
would you do you think that that's fair
yeah he I feel like we can just conclude
that as the working assumption
because the you know if they added the
CIA visits you personally
and keep in mind the head of the CIA
visited him after he had been convicted
the first time
this is after conviction
people knew exactly what they were
dealing with at that point
so there you go all right here's a uh
little uh quiz for you see how good you
are at analyzing the news
of MSNBC
uh was complaining about who is he
complaining about complaining about
somebody else complaining that black
people were killing each other at a
higher rate than white people were
killing each other and that always on
Bill Martin yeah it was Bill Maher so
Bill Maher uh said why aren't we talking
more about the high murder rate
within the black community of black on
black crime because it's so high
and many Hassan tried to fact-check
Belmar
uh by pointing to a USA Today article
and and he essentially quoted them and
said
quote white people kill other white
people at almost the same rate that
black people kill other black people and
yet you never hear anyone complaining
about white on white crime these aren't
points of sage wisdom from Mar who was
talking about black on black crime he
said they are classic racist dog
whistles
ah
you know
it's not my job to defend Bill Maher
but I'm going to have to do it you're
gonna have to do it number one
can somebody give me a fact check
didn't Bill Maher famously Day-Day black
woman for a fairly extended period of
time
is that true or not that's true right I
mean I just saw pictures and
even though I do agree with the people
who say when you say I have a black
friend that doesn't mean you're not a
racist right if you have a black friend
that's sort of the joke
but if you've actually had a serious
relationship
across ethnic lines
I feel like that's all you have to say
like I feel I feel like if you're in a
romantic relationship
with somebody you don't have to explain
anything ever again now
I'm talking about myself I'm defending
Bill Maher I think if you've had one
long-term relationship
with a black woman and you're a white
guy
people should just leave you the
alone after that now again it doesn't
prove anything right I get it I mean it
could be a one-off it doesn't prove
anything but it's as close as you can
get to leave me alone right it's as
close as you could get to well what have
you done
all right I've got a show where I'm
always highlighting you know uh black
leaders I have lots of black guests I've
actually my personal life this would be
Bill Maher yeah it was substantially
with you know black friends and black
women
does he really need to explain anything
I don't think he needs to explain his
feelings about things and even the fact
that Bill Maher was bringing it up do
you think he was bringing it up to make
a racist point about black people or do
you think he was bringing it up because
it's like a horrible thing happening
within the black community and he wants
to make sure it's not ignored
like everything that
many Hassan said made no sense but the
weirdest part is this thing where he
said that white people kill other white
people at almost the same rate that
black people kill other black people
fact check me true or false is that true
or false that black people kill black
people at the same rate
as white people kill white people
it's false
and true
it's a hundred percent false and it's a
hundred percent true
it is it's 100 true and 100 false how
can it be at the same time
here's Al
it depends what you mean by rate
the article that he pointed out
showed that the raw number of black
Skilling blacks and white Skilling
whites per year is about the same
2500 ish
so about 2500 are blacks killed by
blacks about 2500 whites killed by
whites every year same rate
right so the number of killed per year
which is what rate is right when you
talk about rate you're not talking about
absolute number
you're talking about per year
or per capita
if you talk about it per year
the rate is similar
that's what Maddie said the rate per
year is similar and that and the use of
the word rate is actually correct
so what what many Hassan is saying is
100 correct
that the rate
is about the same
but he's using rate as per year
which is very misleading if you use rate
to mean per person or per capita then in
something like four to five times higher
rate of black on black crime
now which one is the racist dog whistle
it seems to me that Bill Maher pointing
out an underserved gigantic problem in
the black community is the opposite of a
dog whistle that seems to be exactly
trying to help
well I don't see any I don't see any
even whiff of self-interest or
self-dealing or money making there's no
follow the money
there's no nothing
it's just an observation
that there's an underserved cause
so
um I'm going to say that many Hassan's
tweet is technically true but um
and I I'm not going to say
that he intends it to be misleading
because that would be mind reading and
I'm trying not to do that I can just say
it is misleading
we don't know why
we can observe his history and maybe
come up with something
come up with some clips
sorry we might be able to look at the
pattern and come up with some guesses
but right now can't read his mind
all right
um let's talk about the Ukraine war a
little bit so here's where we're at
Russia is using Iranian drones that just
are targeted to blow up on certain
places and I guess they're attacking Kev
and energy structures and stuff like
that now
here's here's what else we know Russia
has more uh
soldiers troops has more troops
in the war than when they started
so although many Russians have been
killed maybe 50 000 ish they they have
more fighting today than when they
started
so that looks good for Russia they also
have lost uh almost nothing in terms of
assets
after all this fighting they still have
plenty of uh you know ships and uh
aircraft
so you have plenty of ships plenty of
aircraft plenty of people
but
the Wagner group is still complaining
bitterly that they don't have ammo and
shells so they don't have enough weapons
so you know I've been saying for a while
that Ukraine the war there could depend
on you know any one of a number of
variables and there might be just one of
them
just any one of them could be the thing
that determines who wins and it looks
like at this point
what might be you know this could be
misinformation by the way it could be
that the Wagner group is
maybe pretending that they don't have
shells when they do you know I'm not
sure if there's a military advantage to
lying about this or not but the Wagner
group is saying they're running on ammo
so it's not going to really help them to
have ships and aircraft and soldiers
poorly trained in many cases if they
don't have bullets and and shells
now
um it was everybody going to yell at me
I'm waiting for the yelling
there you go M Lansing thank you I was
waiting for the NPC comment the NPC
comment is you said Ukraine would win
the war
the war's not over
the war's not over
I'll just telling you where it's at at
the moment
and I don't know what wind would look
like I've never said that Ukraine would
get back all their territory
have I
have I
do a fact check on me have I ever said
that Ukraine would give back all of its
captured territory
I don't think I have I just said that
they would not be evanquished you know
as easily as people thought
um and I still think they won't be
vanquished entirely as a country at
least not right away
but I guess the only thing I'm adding to
this is that uh Ukraine says it's
planning for this big counter-offensive
um but maybe ammo will be the main thing
and it could be that the ukrainians
don't have enough ammo either
what if both sides ran out of bullets
oh that's actually possible isn't it
you can actually have both sides run out
of ammo
I wonder if that's how it'll lend
maybe so
all right
um
let's talk about the biggest story in AI
is that apple is bad at it and there's
some reporting now about why apple is
lagging for
uh full disclosure
um Apple was a big part of my portfolio
it started as a small part of my
portfolio
I didn't realize how fast it went up
like 600 since I owned it but I got rid
of it because I don't trust Apple
in the age of AI
because I couldn't understand why Siri
remains so bad I mean really bad
um
when all these other countries are doing
amazing things with AI and stuff like
that and it didn't even sound like apple
had any announcements or any cool demos
or anything like that
um
right
so here's some inside reporting
apparently the Siri platform the way
it's architected and I don't know the
details is very limited in its ability
to just move to AI
so in my simplistic mind I was saying to
myself hey if you've already got this
thing in your hand call the phone and it
already knows how to talk to you why
can't you just updated software so it's
smarter
well the trouble is that Apple likes a
little bit more control on their product
and the control they want is to keep you
out of trouble so I don't buy the I
don't mind the Instinct so much but
privacy is a big thing
and one of the problems with AI is that
AI lives in the network
which means you'd be talking with the
network when you're doing any searching
and Apple's not comfortable with that if
you're just talking with your device
you've got a little more at least an
opportunity for more privacy
so
however
we know from Brian romelli's work that
people are already putting the entire at
least GPT 3.5 they've put on one device
so you can run AI on your local device
um
so I don't know if that might be a thing
that happens with apple but people are
leaving and they're unhappy and they
think the company is way behind and and
Apple's also worried because AI is known
to be a liar
so Apple wants to
carefully script anything that Siri is
going to say
because it only wants you it only wants
you to get answers that humans have
really scrubbed to make sure they're not
doing anything too controversial or
sexual or anything like that and I have
to say that impulse has worked really
well for them
so Apple's preference for privacy
I appreciate it actually made them look
like a stronger company in my in my
opinion
although I don't know privacy can ever
be protected
so
um
the uh the full disclosure is I sold all
of my Apple stock last week I think so I
sold all my Apple stock
and the reason is that uh I think AI is
too much of a disrupter for the
smartphone industry
all right
that
ladies and gentlemen
are my prepared comments
um is there anything else uh yeah I
don't oh yeah I don't give Financial
advice so I'm not telling you to buy or
not buy Apple
uh I should point out that my
my track record of guessing individual
companies is really bad
just like everybody else's really bad so
don't don't believe anything I say about
individual companies
uh when am I gonna have Scott Ritter on
the show well I don't have a guess on
the show
Scott Ritter would tell me that Russia
is totally winning they will win and
Ukraine is toast do I need to have them
on the show
I just told you what he's going to say
and then you're going to say but he's a
Russian agent he literally works for uh
Russia Today the publication that's a
Russian government-owned
government-directed publication
so
this is the best show you experienced
all week thank you George
I think you're right
how will Dilbert deal with AI
well he'll probably be dating it
so if you're uh if you're not subscribed
to
Scott adams.locals.com
you don't get to see the new dilberts
that are a little bit edgier than what
you're used to if you know what I mean
yeah so to back up my point that I'm
terrible at picking stocks
at when the pandemic happened in Wynn
Resorts you know the wind hotels went
down to practically nothing I bought it
and held it because I thought well
there's no way
this isn't going to come back and be
screaming because it's like one of the
best or maybe the best of the hotel
chains and I thought as soon as we can
travel again this thing's going to go
right back and then then China had its
coven problem
and everybody said uh oh Wind Resort has
resorts in China they're going to get
taken down by that
but
China worked through it apparently it
looks like things are going well so the
Wind Resort the moment I sold it after
holding it for two years or so the
moment I sold it it went to the moon and
by the way that's my pattern the minute
I saw something it goes to the moon
so
um
I saw a comment there looked interesting
trouble is I can't
um
yeah so when a comment goes by and the
locals I can drag it back to look at it
but I can't keep it there it'll it'll
keep moving even if my fingers are so I
can't actually read the end of your
sentence you know anything longer
anything longer than maybe six or seven
words I can't read
so if you're if you're doing long
comments on locals
like this one so the one that says Scott
comma black complaints about I I there's
no way I can read that sentence and you
should not have started with Scott comma
because that used up a lot of the real
estate that I could look at
so you want to put that into five words
or or it's not going to work as a
comment
do you think Hunter will be indicted
I would
oh yeah we need to go private
go in private
um
I would bet the hunter will never be
prosecuted
what do you bet
I don't know if he'll be indicted
but I don't think he'll be prosecuted
um
and
so that's my only prediction about
Hunter there will be lots more
Revelations and lots more of this or
that but I think that there's too much
government power protecting him at the
moment so I think he'll be fine because
I don't see a scenario in which Hunter
could be prosecuted while Joe Biden is
running for president
that's not going to happen
uh well it might I'm going to bet
against it but nothing's 100
. all right I saw a number of comments
about Tate
there's nothing new about Tate is there
he's just still under house arrest
and
um
lesson becomes a true liability Maybe
correspondent dinner I didn't pay
attention to it
oh yeah there's some reporting that
Andrew Tate is being poisoned
um because he's getting sick from
whatever he's eating
yeah I don't know about that see the
trouble is
for the same reason I say you shouldn't
believe anything the Romanian government
says about the tades
I don't think you could believe anything
the Tates say about the Romanian
government
those will be two entities that are not
exactly
trustworthy so it could be it could be
that he's getting poisoned it's possible
I just don't think you can know for sure
anything that's happening
all right
um
most food is poison yeah
all right
uh
black complaints about police are so now
six times or five times I've seen the
comment that starts with black
complaints about police are
I have no idea what comes after that and
I have no way to find out what comes
after that
I'm assuming you're gonna say they went
down
are really about everyday interactions
not shootings
all right well I I don't know what to do
with that comment
it's about interactions not shootings
okay
is that a national issue or something
I don't I don't know how to connect that
to anything
all right
um mental work will be valueless with AI
I'm finding the opposite
so here's what I'm discovering so far
there's one thing that AI doesn't seem
to be able to do at all and I don't know
if it ever will
now the smart people say Scott you don't
understand it's just beginning it's just
Beginnings God it will do these things
you say it can't do they might be right
but that's the most that's the NPC thing
to say about AI
so you can identify the the NPCs by
they're the ones who are saying I know I
can't do it yet
but it totally will
we all we all understand that point it
need not be said we all get that all
right
but here's my observation AI is
worthless without a human telling it
what to do and then telling it whether
it did it correctly
unless that ever changes and I don't
think it will I think that can't change
by its nature
there are some things I'll give you this
there are some things that AI will know
we want before we know we want it would
you agree there'll be lots of things
that AI figures out you want it might
figure out that you're thirsty before
you know you're thirsty
because it might you know look at your
watch or something your you know your
health monitor and say oh you're
starting to get dehydrated so I can see
lots of apps applications where the AI
would make a decision for a person
before they even knew they needed a
decision it was just proactively tell
them you need this I'm going to take
care of it however
the overwhelmingly big use of AI will be
a human who wants something
and then has to make the AI do it and
then has to judge whether it did it
correctly and then has to make any final
edits maybe has to find three to five
different AI apps to all work in tandem
to do the thing now again at some point
the AI might on its own
might on its own be able to organize
other apps and you know API to them and
use whatever other AI Services it needs
and just buy them on the on the Fly you
just give it a credit card and say look
if you need to attach to some other AI
to get a function going go ahead and do
it up to 25 dollars per year
so I'll give you a budget but if you
need an app that's 9.95 a month just
here's my credit card just sign up for
it
and we're good to go
so
yeah
I think that we will that most thinking
jobs the kind you think will be replaced
by AI will be replaced with AI Wranglers
so there'll be humans who need to
control the AI it'll be like
like the dog herding the Sheep you know
the AI will be the Sheep but the Sheep
will never learn
where the dog wants them to go
and when right the reason the reason
that you need a dog to go get the Sheep
is that you can't just open the gate at
five o'clock and say It's Five O'Clock
sheep
come on sheep It's Five O'Clock we do
this every single day you guys know that
when I'm the owner of the sheep opens
his gate you're all supposed to line up
and go through it
but they don't
you need a dog for that
so I think we're going to be the dog
we'll always be wrangling the the AI to
give us what we ask for and then make
sure it's what we ask for
let's learn to be the dogs yes
you know I'm very close to the point but
I'm not sure yet it makes sense that I
feel like well let me tell you what I
would do if I were in my 20s
and I happened to be in my 20s at the
dawn of the AI Revolution
I would be spending every weekend and
every night after work
playing with AI so that nobody at my
company knew more about it than I did
right now I'm not talking about an AI
company but if you're just like a
regular company
I I would stop everything
I would stop everything I would stop my
social life if I had one when I was in
my 20s I would stop everything and every
weekend I'd come home and I'd open up my
laptop and I would learn as much as I
could about how to use AI
then at my company when the company is
panicking about how to use it you're
going to say well I've been researching
this every night for weeks and you know
I should be on that committee that
decides how we use Ai and then your boss
says okay does anybody else know
anything about AI a few people say well
I read some articles I saw some stuff on
Twitter
but I would say I've spent every weekend
for three months on a deep dive and I
wrote this white paper that I'm gonna
I'm gonna give around to the company to
tell them the highlights to keep you
informed
in other words
I would make sure that my job
was the smartest guy who knows about AI
in my company and believe me that's the
best advice you'll ever get
now that assumes that you're a certain
kind of personality right somebody who
can really dig in and has some a little
bit of technical
you know comprehension
but
it would be easy to become the expert in
AI at your company
don't leave that upper that's free money
right given that you know AI will be
important to your company
if you're not the one who gets there
first and best and strongest
you're going to regret it your whole
life your your whole life you're going
to regret it this is once ever
right when I've told you this story
before when personal computers were
brand new
I worked at Crocker bank and my little
group of I don't know five people we
were the first ones in the bank to have
a personal computer at work
the first ones
I spent every weekend
and after and after work on my own
learning how these computer things work
learning to program learning you know
what they can and cannot do and and so
my career options were you know greatly
magnified by that
greatly magnified because the the
leaders in the company knew I was one of
five people
who understood this new technology that
was going to change everything and did
so that was once ever
there was only one time that personal
computers were new to Corporate America
and I saw that and I said there's
free money all over the floor here and
nobody's sweeping it up so I just got
the biggest broom I could and swept that
 up and had all kinds of job
opportunities after that
um this the AI introduction will never
happen again it only gets introduced
once and the money the free money is
just laying all over the ground
everywhere because you know what your
boss is not doing
your boss is not taking all weekend to
learn about AI
nobody is
well not not many people so you just
gotta get the biggest broom you can and
start sweeping that free money up that's
what I'd do now if you're in your
50s maybe it's a different game but if
you're in your 20s
I wouldn't be doing anything else at
night
yeah you bought your own IBM PC at the
beginning the same thing I did yeah I I
scraped together whatever money I could
to get the first versions of the home
computer a little screen like this about
what is that like
six inches by six inches and it was
monochrome and it was orange you know
what it wasn't even green and white it
was orange and white do you remember
those
yeah I spent hours and hours on them
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is all I
wanted to say publicly I'm going to talk
to the locals people privately but
YouTube thanks for joining another
amazing live stream
oh Sinclair I'll talk about him later
bye for now
