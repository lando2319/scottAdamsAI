we get going can somebody tell me if you
can hear my audio
anybody anybody trying something new
today so
if nobody hears me i'll need to unplug
this and do something different
give me a give me a sign of life in the
comments
um all right well we'll wait for that
literally can anybody hear me
seriously oh okay one person good enough
good enough
we're testing out a new uh new device on
here
and if you'd like to enjoy this
very special episode of coffee with
scott adams well
there's a way to do it and all it takes
is a copper marker glass a tanker
chelsea stein a canteen jugger flask of
vessel
of any kind and you should fill it with
your favorite liquid
i'm partial to coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna happen right now go
ah so let me tell you what i'm doing i'm
methodically a b testing my way to
better sound
at the moment i'm using a still using a
lavalier clip-on
because i like my range of motion
i don't like being locked onto a
stationary
device but i'm using the shure
let's see the sure x2 0
to connect my lavalier to my ipad
and apparently this is giving it a
little bit of a boost
maybe maybe
oh we have good news not good news we
have interesting news today
so it won't all be about my sound system
actually interesting things happening
number one
president trump ex-president trump is uh
warning that he says quote watch
next week because you'll see me do
something about big tech and
people have wanted me to do it for a
long time it won't be
too surprising they don't love me to
talk about it early
but watch what i do next week on big
tech i think you'll find it very
interesting
and once again president trump
ex-president trump becomes the most
interesting person in the news
as he does every time he opens his mouth
so what do you think it will be
a lawsuit it's got to be a lawsuit right
so it's either going to be a lawsuit or
starting his own platform
because he's saying he's doing something
about it it's one of those two things
but it feels like more likely a lawsuit
wouldn't you say
if you had to guess just based on the
wording of it
because doing something about it
i suppose that could be a new platform
it could be either one couldn't it
i guess i can't have i can't predict
this one but my first
instinct was a lawsuit so we'll see
in related news there's a news coming
out
that maybe the trump organization could
be hit with
charges for tax evasion
specifically for giving
executives benefits that are as good as
cash
but were not accounted for for tax
purposes
now
does that make sense so i'm trying to
figure this out
if you're a company and you decide to
give your executive
a let's say a free apartment
the company would be paying for it and
then writing it off on their taxes
but the person who received it would not
be counting it as
a taxable income and therefore
the government would not be getting
their due but here's the interesting
thing
what if this is the biggest problem
anybody found in the trump organization
because it's the one we're hearing about
and we're not hearing a rumor about
oh and i think they're digging into some
foreign
russians something something right
now i don't know if you're if you follow
tax
law very carefully i hope you don't
but this is a really small
legal problem meaning that the legal
problem would be limited to the
corporation
the trump family members and trump
himself
would not be under legal risk
specifically
only the entity would be under legal
risk and probably the
sum of all of these uh alleged
infractions
if there were a penalty on top of it
which would be a typical
typical outcome they could just pay it
and this is one of the most i would
imagine one of the most
common corporate you know
what would you call it bad behavior
and even the anti-trumpers on cnn are
saying
nobody goes to jail for this and not
only does nobody go to jail for it
but typically charges aren't even
brought because i assume the irs can
just
demand a payment they don't have to take
you to court
if you didn't pay then it'd be a
different different issue but i think
the way these are normally handled
is they just give you a bill and it's a
really big bill and you have to pay it
right so what if after
all of the warnings about everything
that's going to
come crashing down on the trump
organization what if it all came down to
just
this little thing that won't affect the
individuals it might be just write a
check
now of course part of this might be that
they're putting a pressure on
alan weaselberg
am i pronouncing his name right i was
writing it down quickly i feel like i
made up a whole new name for him
weiselberg
[Laughter]
wait did did i just realize that his
name
if you pronounced it incorrectly would
be weasel
but weaselberg how do you actually
pronounce it
weiselberg but anyway if they're putting
pressure on the top financial guy in the
organization the reason would be
to get him to give up some goods that
obviously they don't have
without him so
so it's really starting to look like the
trump
family members are going to be fine at
the moment
no anti-semitism please
not called for we can make fun of his
name without being
anti-semitic let's uh let's draw that
line
pretty starkly okay um yeah we don't
want any of that i don't want to block
you
just just don't be a jerk okay
all right so that's coming
new york times is breaking news
apparently they found a massive
fossilized
body part from a new species of ancient
human
so this could turn out to be a whole new
ancient species we didn't know about
and they found a really large
body part fossilized they've named this
new
um entity homology
homology and they found a
massive body part that was fossilized
it was a skull it was a skull yeah
it was a massive skull and
they're not calling him homology because
why because there are such things as
seventh grade boys you don't want to
have
a science class trust me on this
you don't want to have a science class
where your science teacher
stands in front of a bunch of seventh
grade boys
and says they found this new fossil from
homology now
that lesson will just go right off the
track because i don't know if you know
this but
all men are seventh grade boys
on the inside we never really get past
that
yeah this might be the first time you've
heard it but
if you're in the male uh category
you hit about seventh grade and your
sense of humor locks in
and after that you just pretend it
didn't
but
they're going to call they're calling
this uh finding dragon man
instead of homology now again we're not
making
anti-lgbtq jokes here i'm just pointing
out that if you
say homo longing in front of a bunch of
7th grade boys
that lesson plan is going to go off the
track
pretty quickly all right
here's a twitter handling the question
of uh what
experts say about masks don't turn it
off
you'll like this part you know even the
people who hate me on masks
now it's my it's my belief that masks
are effective if used
you know in the right situations and
obviously the right situation is
important so if you're out going for a
jog
probably that's not the right situation
to wear a mask
but here's so twitter will often
summarize a topic and then point you to
a bunch of articles on that topic and so
they did that today
and it was titled experts say masks are
safe and effective in preventing the
spread of kofit 19.
now if you saw a summary title that was
going to refer to a number of tweets
and it told you that masks are safe and
effective according to experts and fact
checkers
what would you expect to find would you
expect to find
links to those experts would you expect
to find data
from those experts would you expect to
see fact checking links where you could
go to the fact checking and maybe there
would be more links
where they would point to studies and
and experts and stuff like that no
you don't have that what you have is
just a statement
the experts say masses are safe and
effective with no link
to any experts a separate reference to
the
cdc but no link to a specific expert and
no link to data
so here's the problem
here's the problem why would you present
the truth
exactly the way people present lies
now i'm not saying that masks are
ineffective i've been saying since the
beginning
even when the who and cdc were saying
that you shouldn't use a mask
i was still saying you should use a mask
so i'm the most
pro mask if used right don't leave that
part out right
i've never been pro mask outdoors i've
never been pro-masked for somebody
vaccinated
but i've been pro-masked for you know
the specific situations
and even i think this looks like
 right
i'm already persuaded pre-persuaded
already totally primed to accept the
masks work
in the right situations and they can't
give me a freaking link to it
because people challenge me all the time
on this and i would love to have
oh here's the source i'll just write
down that link you know copy it
then every time somebody asks me i'll
say oh here's here's all the experts
and their studies and their data and you
can see for yourself
but now this is presented
the way you present a lie
why is this just massive incompetence
i mean this is to present the truth
especially in an important medical
question as a lie
in other words the format that only
liars use
which is you leave out your data because
the data doesn't support your point
why do it this way i got a problem with
this
it's probably more of a media problem
than a science problem
because the media has to interpret
science and they just can't here's what
i think is happening
i think that the experts are sure that
these things work
meaning mostly experts in most
industrialized countries
are pretty sure that works but they
don't have data
is that what's going on that the experts
just using the sum of everything they
know about the topic
are pretty sure it works the masks in
the right situations
but they don't have the right data they
don't have anything to point to do they
that's the only thing i can figure out
is that they're sure
but they're sure without data
the very entity which tells us you
should never be sure without data
because you could be so easily misled
this is very uncomfortable because
i want them to give me cover for having
said that in the right situations
and only in the right situations the
masks could be effective
i would love to have some support for
that
but apparently that doesn't exist so let
me
let me let me say as clearly as possible
as far as i can tell there's no support
for that opinion
scientific or it would be here
right why would you leave that out
so i still think they work but i don't
think it's
supported in in the way that you'd want
it to be supported by science
um all right
here's a interesting uh i idea that i
saw in a tweet by
jeff pilkington uh who you should follow
he has a lot of great uh a lot of great
tweets that
cut sometimes they cut left and
sometimes they cut right
and there aren't many people who can
straddle that line
so you should follow him it's jeff with
the g g e
o f f pilkington p i l
k england all right and uh he's pointing
to an article that says
uh uh in the near term classic
psychedelics is what we're going to have
um basically there's an idea that
psychedelics you could separate the part
that makes you happy
with the psychedelics the euphoric part
and turn that into a drug to make people
less depressed and happy without the
trip
so there are people figuring out how to
take a psychedelic and remove the
psychedelic part
but keep the euphoria apart is that a
good idea
how many of you who have experienced
psychedelics
of one kind or another if you have
experienced psychedelics
would it be a good idea to remove the
psychedelic
experience and just keep the the feel
good part
what do you think
it's a bad idea it might be one of the
worst ideas i've ever heard
in my life so here's what's missing in
the story
yeah you can see in the comments anybody
who's had experience with the
psychedelics they will tell you
the trip is the medicine
the the the psychedelic part
the part that you remember the part that
you experience
that's the medicine because it changes
how you see the world permanently
and that change that affects your body
chemistry your mental health etc
but if you take out the psychological
mental part of the experience
all you have is a deeply addictive drug
right let's say it worked let's say they
could come up with a drug that would
just make you happy
could you not take it for the rest of
your life
no you would have to take that drug for
the rest of your life
you would be addicted to some
pharmaceutical jug
that you would have to pay for and you
could never go off it for the rest of
your life because it would just feel too
good
and the alternative would be to feel
your old depressed shitty way
it's the worst idea i've ever heard in
my life on the surface
right i mean i'm open to learning that
maybe there's
something i don't know but on the
surface is really missing the point by
as much as you can miss it
it's the experience that is the medicine
not the chemistry
at all in my opinion my non-medical
opinion there so
take that with skepticism but
i learned in the process of looking into
this that
there was a hypothesis by
terence mckenna who died in
year 2000 he was an ethnobotanist
and he proposed that maybe the way the
apes evolved into humans or at least the
way early humans
evolved into the smart kind of humans
that we know
is that they had a lot of mushrooms
so there's actually a hypothesis i don't
know how much weight to put on this
that the the very reason that uh early
apes or ape humans or whatever the early
prototypes were
uh yeah the stone exactly it's called
the stoned
ape hypothesis that what evolved us to
our higher level of
consciousness i guess was taking a lot
of mushrooms
and i guess there's a little bit of
evidence
about that so
i'm not sure i would buy into that
hypothesis
but it's really provocative and i also
wouldn't rule it out
so on its surface i would say wow that's
provocative
maybe i wouldn't bet anything on it but
it's at least within the realm of maybe
possible
um have i told you before that one of
the ways you can
identify a vulnerable narcissist
is that they have very consistent
behavior patterns
which i only learned recently that
the people who are in this category will
respond in a very predictable way
and i've told you before that cnn
responds like a vulnerable narcissist
and you can actually predict it fairly
easily here's a perfect example
what happens when a vulnerable
narcissist has been telling a lie
let's say they've been gaslighting you
presenting you with a
set of complete falsehoods and then you
call them out and you prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt maybe you've
got documentation
you've got written proof but you prove
that the
the narcissist was lying what happens
does anybody know what happens when you
prove
no doubt about it that a narcissist has
lied
about something big what do they do
they will predictably
go after the messenger they will say
things like how did you find that
out as opposed to it's true or false
and they'll say you have no credentials
to say that they'll say you once lied in
the past
you have a bad character so what
happened
when cnn discovered that
all that reporting they'd done about
trump allegedly
clearing the square with tear gas so
that he could do a photo op with an
upside down bible
which is what cnn had reported for many
months and then the inspector general
finds out
then none of that's true that it wasn't
the trump administration they cleared
the park
it was the local people and they did it
for a good reason
and even the bible wasn't upside down
and basically everything about the story
was false
so what does cnn do when
it's proven beyond any reasonable doubt
that the reporting was
all gaslighting and for months
and months
what did they do well jim acosta
attacked the inspector
general of being somebody who was
trying to apply for a job at mar-a-lago
he basically went after the messenger an
inspector general who has worked for
both administrations
democrat and republican a totally
trusted public servant
who up until this point had been doing
nothing but bipartisan
work for both sides and suddenly
cnn has decided that this guy is the
biggest in the world
and you guess you shouldn't listen to
that
my friends is a classic tell
for vulnerable narcissism now of course
i'm
extending the the theory here
farther than i should and i'm making it
about an organization
as opposed to a person but i feel like
cnn
acts like a person which is my
hypothesis
that you could predict what cnn will do
next
by narcissist theory so you should
so let's make a prediction the next time
cnn is found to be completely presenting
fake news
look for one of their um one of their
main
characters to attack the personality or
the credibility of whoever
caught them look for that to happen
again and
you'll start seeing that the pattern is
repeatable
all right um you know i've been out and
about as many of you have
especially if you've been vaccinated and
i don't know if you're having this
experience but
i go into safeway the local supermarket
yesterday and i note that maybe half of
the people are unmasked
presumably the people with vaccinations
including me
and i see about half the people still
have masks on presumably they
are not vaccinated might be some that
are
and i said to myself we basically have
created
two classes of people one class is free
like me i don't have to wear a mask i'm
free and the other class
are still sort of a slave class they
have to wear a mask to go into
into a place of business i don't
and i said to myself well i completely
respect
anybody's medical decision that's
different from mine
i'm not a doctor so i'm not going to
tell you what you should or should not
do with a mask or a vaccination
i can talk about whether they work but
that's different from what you should do
right your decisions are your decisions
especially the medical
ones so don't let me be influencing that
that said it really
feels bad for me i
have i i have this deep empathy
for the people who did not get the
vaccination i get you had a reason
or maybe it wasn't available yet or you
just haven't gotten around to it
but boy does it feel different when i
walk into a store without a mask now
i feel like the freest person in the
world and
i look around and see my masked you know
citizens they look like they're not
happy
and i feel bad for them now again i'm
not telling you you should get
a vaccination that's a medical decision
it's not one for me to influence you
but if you want freedom
they've kind of made it hard to get it
one way and easy to get it the other way
and if i had not been already inclined
to get the vaccinations
i think i would have gotten them just
for the freedom
which isn't the right medical incentive
in my opinion
i would like to make my medical
decisions entirely based on a medical
analysis but i wouldn't if i didn't have
the vaccination and i
had to wear a mask in the grocery store
and everybody else didn't
or at least everybody vaccinated didn't
i'd probably just go get the vaccination
just to buy my freedom back at the at
the risk of whatever
complications the vaccination could
present small
but complications so
what do you feel about the ethics of
using
freedom as a
incentive to get vaccinated
that's really wrong isn't it do you have
the same feeling about it
it might work and it might turn out to
be you know the most useful thing that
ever happened
but it feels really unethical that the
reason
people are being pressured to get a
vaccination is so they can travel
right so they can travel it would be one
thing if you're still in the middle of
the pandemic
and you know you're just doing whatever
you can to save lives
but we're sort of past that part and
we're into the part where if you're not
vaccinated
you know exactly what the risks are all
right we're all we're all informed at
this point
um huh
interesting very bizarre message i don't
know what it means but
if one of you said it to me uh you're
gonna need to be more clear than that
all right we continue to have public
arguments about critical race theory
some for it some against it
but we're not really even talking about
the same thing right
whatever your opinion of it is is
different than the people on the other
side
and so when you say you shouldn't do it
you're not even in the same conversation
because they're saying shouldn't do what
you're not even talking about the right
thing
why wouldn't we teach history you're
saying i'm not talking about teaching
history i'm talking about the bad things
you say
what bad things do we say well here are
some examples well we don't say those
things but somebody says those things
yeah but they only spend two minutes
talking about it and they talk mostly
about history
yeah but that's a bad two minutes the
whole argument over critical race theory
it's not even anywhere near the
the realm of a rational logical argument
where people are presenting their facts
and then you're arguing on the same set
of facts nothing like that's happening
here's what i would like to see i'd like
to see a checklist
of critical race theory let's say
claims or framing
could be the one facts claims or the way
they frame something
just want to see a list and then when
somebody says i don't like
critical race theory in this context
then the other person can say
all right here's the full list the only
thing from the list that we want to
teach in our school or
our business or our military whatever is
this one
this one and this one so we're not
teaching the whole list
but we're taking some important things
from the list
we don't call that critical race theory
we just call it some good things that
people need to know
tell me what those are stop making me
argue critical race theory yes or no
because it's never quite
that it's something on the checklist
from a bigger checklist that might be
called critical race theory and adjacent
ideas but just give us the detail what
is the exact
claim that you object to what is the
frame
stated in one sentence or two that you
like
or you object to if you can't if you
can't break it down to a list of bullet
points
that you like and don't like what are we
talking about
we're not even on the same freaking
conversation so
if you don't see that you're not going
to see any
any journalists who are even serious
about this topic
you know maybe it's not the government
who does it but maybe there should be a
journalist
who just says look here are all the
claims that are
uh within critical race theory plus a
few that are sort of floating around
you know the the domain want to be
complete
and just put them out there right now i
suppose somebody would argue that that
would lose its context
but probably that's gonna happen anyway
if you're just taking three or five
things out of a list
you've lost the context right there
um yes all right
so um are you following this uh general
milly situation glenn greenwald has a
great sub stack on it i tweeted it
again you should follow glenn greenwald
um
you really should like it's just one of
the best
um consistently best journalists and
tweeters
in the world um i would add to him
uh joel people you should
definitely follow
right joel um
with breitbart you can find him pretty
easily you should follow him
and matt taube
i'd say follow him
and probably a few others i'll add to
the list as we go
and the reason that i add these specific
people is that it's people who are at
least capable
of seeing the whole field right if you
if you're following people who are only
seeing half the field
you're going to be misled all the time
all right so here's the problem with
general milly head of the joint chiefs
so he's the top u.s military guy right
who actually is in the military he's the
top
and here's something he said this is
actually a quote from him
at whatever recent congressional uh
conversation was happening
he said what is it that caused thousands
of people to assault
this building and try to overturn the
constitution of the united states of
america
what caused that i want to find that out
i want to maintain an open mind here
and i do want to analyze it so
millie has stated as a fact that the
building was
assaulted with the intention of
overturning the constitution of the
united states
that's what the top military
commander of the united states
the military commander believes that
there was an assault
to overturn the constitution of the
united states
my friends that never happened
there definitely was a a protest an
assault there were definitely crimes
that happened
but nobody there was trying to overturn
the constitution
indeed every person there was trying to
affirm the constitution in as they saw
it
right now obviously there are different
opinions about
how to you know interpret the
constitution
were the protesters believing that they
were within the constitution
by asking let's say pence to pause
things or
asking for a fair a fair election
in their opinion asking for audits maybe
what part of that is overthrowing a
constitution
if your top military general
believes there was an imaginary an
assault on the
constitution effectively an insurrection
if he believes that happened he needs to
be out of that job
you can't have your top military guy
hallucinating an attack on the united
states
let me ask you is there anything that
would be more disqualifying
than having your top military commander
hallucinate an attack on the united
states and believe it happened
when in fact the evidence clearly shows
it did not
nothing could be more dangerous than
your top military commander
clearly hallucinating clearly
in his own words he described in his own
words a hallucination
that he's having now he didn't say i
used to have a hallucination
he says this is my current opinion that
somebody attacked the united states to
overturn the constitution and that is so
clearly something that didn't happen
you've got to get
rid of that guy he should be going by
the end of the day
biden should fire his ass
immediately
now of course we don't think biden's
really in charge so nothing like that's
going to happen
but this is shocking i don't know if i
can think of a more disqualifying thing
for a military officer
and i'm i'm very pro-military right if
you know if i've never said it out loud
i'm very pro-military it's one of the
best things about this country
is that the military is free of politics
usually usually
but this is not free of politics it's
either mental health or it's politics
and either way it's completely
disqualifying and you need to replace
them immediately
this is a firing offense like
immediately
so but for political reasons none of
that's going to happen
all right here's some maybe fake news on
fake news this is fake news squared
so this is somebody calling out fake
news
that actually is real news so it's the
calling out of the fake news that's real
news that's fake news
got it goes like this you're all aware
that there's a
surge in shoplifting in san francisco
in fact many of you saw a viral video of
some young man stuffing a big bag full
of stuff from a store
on his bicycle and then riding his
bicycle out of the store with his big
bag of goodies and nobody stops them
because they're not really going after
shoplifters anymore
but this fact-checking article suggests
that um it's in the chronicles san
francisco chronicle
suggests that maybe that's not really
what's happening maybe
the shop riff shoplifting rate has been
falling for decades
and that is at one of the lowest levels
right now
but there's one little sentence in there
that
sort of raises a hypothesis that maybe
the stores are not reporting all of the
shoplifting
lately because why would stores
stop reporting shoplifting
why would that happen could it be
then nothing can come from it could it
be
that if they report the shoplifting they
lose an hour of their time
and gain back nothing because they're
not going to file a an insurance report
for somebody who stole some condoms
right
i'd like to file this insurance we got
robbed a teenager took a pack of condoms
there's nothing you can do about it if
you can't arrest the perpetrator
what the hell is the point so here's
somebody who writes
an article suggesting that the rate of
shoplifting is not really that much
worse it's a little bit worse than the
chains they admit
but not that much worse
why would anybody keep reporting the
shoplifting when there's no
there's nothing that will happen from it
nothing
so do i always tell you that the thing
democrats get wrong
or let's say left-leaning people get
wrong is they forget human motivation
they forget human motivation in all of
their analyses
what would be the human motivation of
the store manager
once you tell the store manager well you
can report it all you like but it won't
make any difference
the store manager has no incentive
no incentive now they might record the
theft
sort of internally because they got a
report to their superiors
where where'd all the money go but i
don't think they have any reason to tell
the police
the police took that reason away and
here's somebody writing a whole article
in which that should have been the main
point the main point should be well
we're not
tracking it anymore because it wouldn't
be any point to it
derek chauvin got sentenced to 22.5
years of which he will
serve only 15 if he has good behavior
and cnn analysts
say that's very light um
how do you how do you measure that
so is that light um there are other
people who get
longer sentences right and i guess he'd
be out at age 60 if he only served the
15.
but here's the question do we punish
people
more than that if you can't tell if the
act was deliberate
now there is evidence that chauvin
should have acted differently
and therefore he has some responsibility
and so even if you accept that he's
responsible for it
nobody has demonstrated that it was a
deliberate act of murder
whoever got more than 15 years for a
crime they didn't know they were
committing
can you give me any example of that can
anybody give me an example
of somebody who got more than 15 years
in prison
for a crime that they weren't sure they
were committing at the time
even one example of that because
where you know if that's the argument
that other let's say a black
defendant would have gotten more years
is that being are people saying that
um now here's my most provocative
question for you
you're ready for this we're all adults
here right
so i could ask you a provocative
question and you can keep it in context
if all of the ethnicities in the george
floyd
derek chauvin situation if all of the
ethnic
ethnicities had been reversed
would it be the same outcome if derek
joven had been
uh black and if
well or let's even reserve reverse the
people
let's just say it's the people reversed
let's say that george floyd was the
police officer
and was just a you know regular police
officer
and derek chovin was the person who was
on the ground
and derek chauvin dies in exactly the
same way that
that george floyd died would would you
have the same result
yeah i'm seeing an lol there nobody
believes it would be the same outcome
i don't think so because the jury didn't
really have a choice
did they i think the the jury pretty
much had to do what they did
uh legal legal system
you know notwithstanding they just sort
of had to come up with the thing they
came up with
but if you reversed all of the
ethnicities
i doubt it would be the same outcome and
i wonder if there's any way to test that
you know could you someday let's say
that this trial
fades in memory a little bit so you
could find people who weren't aware of
it
well let's say it's a few years later
and you take college kids
and you give them individually one group
of college kids who didn't know much
about the original trial
you say all right here's the situation
you know how much
jail time should the person get then you
give a second set who
also were unfamiliar with the original
news and you just reverse the
ethnicities
and then say all right you know what's
the penalty for this
would you get the same number i'll bet
not
i'll bet not and seems like something
you could test
maybe someday we'll know about that so
arizona was very close
the arizona house they came really close
to passing an amendment to a budget bill
that would have funded
students instead of the school system
meaning that it would have given kids
more freedom of choice
because they could take their funding to
a different private school
et cetera an alternative school but that
failed even though the vote was 28-28
because three republicans udall john and
osborne joined the democrats and voting
against it
now here's my take on this given that
uh black lives matter also likes school
choice
for the most part at least let's say
members of it i don't know what the
the leadership says but certainly plenty
and plenty of black americans want
school choice so here was a topic
that republicans overwhelmingly wanted
and i believe if you do a survey of
black americans they want it by a
majority too
and even members of black lives matter
or just supporters i think if you did a
poll of them you would find that even
they want more school choice
right so here was an issue that if black
lives matter had put their weight
behind it it would have gone through
because do you think that these three
republicans could have said no to it
if you had all the other republicans and
black lives matter supporting it
really do you think this wouldn't have
passed if black lives matter had thrown
in with republicans and said yeah
we got plenty to fight about but not
this
this is the one thing we completely
agree on and by the way
the bad school system is the number one
source of systemic racism
so let's let's deal with the biggest
problem well the fact that black lives
matter did not
support this or i think any other push
like it
shows that they're not a legitimate
movement
if they were legitimate they would be
doing
the top priority thing which is fixing
education
definitely the top priority for black
americans
and they would and they would join with
the side that's on the same side
the republicans but the fact that they
don't do this
easy thing that is clearly in their
self-interest even by their own opinions
not just my opinion their own opinion
would be that this would be in their
best interest
they don't even do that but that tells
you that whatever black lives matter the
organization
is about it's not black lives matter
it's about something it's about
continuing their power
or it's a grievance or it's revenge or
some of all those things but whatever it
is
is not a legitimate movement to help
black americans a legitimate movement
would have
joined the republicans pushed this
through
and had a one of the biggest wins
you could even imagine this would be a
huge win to
to take some of the power away from the
teachers unions
well big tech has lost bill maher you
know who knows that facebook was
blocking posts about the wuhan lab as a
source of the virus
for a long time they're not now i guess
and then he also noted how youtube was
removing brett weinstein's
podcast about ivormectin and
when you see the the people who are
capable of seeing both sides of an
argument
and bill maher would be one of them i
often disagree with him
but you can't you can't question the
fact
that he's capable of seeing both sides
of an argument he demonstrates it all
the time
and if you're losing the people who are
capable of seeing both sides
you're in real trouble and i think the
tech
tech companies are going to come under
some
scrutiny like never before because now
there are so many examples
of things that went wrong it's a
this is this is tough now
you have to ask yourself if it's a
pandemic and it's an emergency
etc so i don't know exactly who's
sending me these messages but
apparently you're watching the uh the
broadcast
at the moment i'll say who are you
before i block it
all right that is all i have for today
um is my sound better than normal
is the sound of volume and quality
better than my normal sound
quality can you give me uh give me a
opinion on that before i go um
yes it's great okay it's a little better
so i've got a few more things i'm going
to try so it won't always
sound like this i've got at least two
more devices to try
and maybe another another
microphone i'll compare this to my prior
broadcast and maybe if anybody feels
like doing that
please do all right the volume is better
yeah i think the sound volume is the
main thing we were trying to fix because
that was the biggest complaint
uh all right
that's all for now talk to you tomorrow
