and now I'm going to explain to the
people who are not you know media Geeks
like I am
how the how the cancellation works
this is the inside story that you won't
hear anywhere else I promise you won't
hear this anywhere else this is the
inside story of how a cancellation works
and if you haven't heard the whole
layout it feels like there's no story
here right it looks pretty
straightforward
if if you were let's say not a media
student you know you were just watching
the news but you didn't study the news
you would say that a cancellation is
this simple situation
somebody did something but bad
the public noticed
then the public reacted to get rid of
this bad actor right and that that's the
way the newspapers are reporting
I did something bad they say you know
they don't that because they omit the
context but they say I did something bad
and then good people react oh terrible
and then they remove me
do you think that explains what actually
happens in the real world
does that sound like something that
actually happened to me
nope not one of those things happened to
me
let me tell you the inside story of what
happened to me
who was the first entity to cancel me do
you remember
I believe it was uh was the Cleveland
Plain Dealer now
is that a Democrat leaning Town
Cleveland
53 black
yeah it's a Democrat town right
now when the Washington Post canceled me
and I think the Washington Post is the
one that mattered because they're the
ones who made it sort of okay for
everybody else to do it
now what has been my opinion of the
Washington Post
which I've said many many times in the
past five years
I've called them fake news
at the same time they were they were
paying me
so at the same time the Washington Post
was paying me I was calling them fake
news up probably every week for years
because it was
the reason I call them fake news is
because it actually is
like actually literally they make up the
news
now how many of you didn't know that
is there anybody here who doesn't know
that the news industry literally makes
up the news or they don't bother to
check it or something but it's wrong
well
there's an article in fortune
that just came out a few weeks ago two
weeks ago and it says that trust and
media is so low that half of Americans
now believe that news organizations
deliberately mislead them
have
what's wrong with the other half
how could only half of the people in the
United States know that the news
misleads them intentionally
how can you not know that
who in the world doesn't know that the
news is basically all fake if it's
political
did you hear that
all of the news is fake if it's
political
because the news organizations don't
even pretend to be non-political it's
just a narrative
so if the News tells you something about
let's say a disaster
and there's no political element it's
probably right it's probably true but if
the news reports anything that has a
political element to it they're not even
trying
there's no attempt not really to tell
you the real news it's all it's all
narrative now I'm surprised that half of
the country is not even aware of that
which perfectly explains my situation
imagine if the whole country knew that
the news was made up whenever it's
political
like literally it's just made up
how would they treat my situation if
they knew
that I was one of the most effective
voices
for Trump in particular
what would how would they treat me
well there's no news organization that
leans left that would treat the story as
an objective news story
they were treated as advocates for
Democrats and the first thing you need
to do is get rid of me from the public
stage
right before a big election
how many of how many of you
knew immediately that this was political
now it's not entirely political yeah let
me be clear it's political at the
cancellation level it's not political at
the public level the public is
responding to what they see
right the Public's just responding but
when the Washington Post cancels me
they're canceling somebody who was their
biggest critic
maybe not the biggest but I'm one of the
biggest critics because they make up the
news
so the fake news
made up some fake news which is easy to
do you just leave out the context in my
case
so you just leave out the context which
is how they create fake news and then
they canceled me for calling them fake
news
now not only for that reason but you
know that they needed to get rid of any
capable voices that might be opposed to
them now did anybody actually say that
out loud at the Washington Post did
anybody sit in the meeting and say you
know
I think we've got to get rid of this guy
because he's got you know a strong
political voice no I don't think so I
don't think so I doubt there was any
like direct conversation but how easy is
it to cancel the person who's your
biggest critic
should you should you take the opinion
from somebody who I've been criticizing
vocally and publicly for five years
in no case is that a reliable
is at a reliable voice but how about the
other voices are they more reliable
well let's let's take a look at some of
the uh the biggest ones
there was CNN
do I do I criticize CNN for fake news
almost every day
for years
yes yes you see an an unbiased source of
news or do they Lee left
well they tried a little bit to be
unbiased but no they're not biased
how about Jake Tapper of CNN I guess he
went at me pretty hard I didn't see it
but I heard that
is Jake Tapper a credible voice on this
topic
what do you think is Jake Tapper a
believable credible voice on this exact
topic well let me tell you something you
didn't know
prior to any of this
a few years ago I canceled Jake Tapper
personally from my own life blocked them
on social media because you know we'd
had a number of interactions privately
and I blocked him because he falsely
accused me of being a racist in person
like individually
he falsely and here's why I say falsely
the context was I was complaining about
the CNN's coverage of the fake news
the Trump called neo-nazis Fine people
now if you're not up with the fake news
that never happened it was a video edit
they just clip out the part where he
says I'm not talking about the neo-nazis
so they take that out and it looks like
he is that's the little trick so CNN has
been running this obvious fake news
for years and I saw this new package
that was on the package using the
industry term and there was a voiceover
from some woman who is
voicing the fake news again about that
hoax
and I complained to him
and he said would you have said that if
the person who did the report had not
been black
now
I think my jaw dropped through the floor
because number one I was not aware of
her ethnicity at all I'd heard a voice
you know the the TV voices they all
sound the same you know any anybody
who's on TV they adopt that sort of
generic voice so I had no I didn't know
who she was before that Abby somebody
I forget her last name but I was only
responding to the content that it was
obviously fake news and it was very bad
for me personally because the fake news
was painting me as a racist
do you get that I was a supporter of
trump
the Fate the fake news said that he said
neo-nazis are good people and therefore
as a supporter I get slimed by the fake
news racism so I was complaining about
being accused
of being a racist unfairly and while I
was complaining about being accused
unfairly he accused me unfairly
so I canceled him and then when this
happened you once again I assume left
out the concept content it was Abby
Phillips at least somebody somebody's
reminding me it was Abby Phillips I
believe and uh
and so he canceled me based on fake news
a third time
this is the third time Jake Tapper has
directly or indirectly canceled me for
fake news once by associating me with
the fake news of trump and the neo-nazis
once by imagining I was racist because
somehow somehow the race of the reporter
would make a difference like I don't
even know how that would make a
difference
because no matter who said it it was
still wrong and I was only talking about
what they said and whether it was
factually right
so this is the third time
Jake Tapper has slammed me
with the wrong context and fake news
for the same thing
now
I've never known a worse piece of I
have to I have to say he is a piece of
 and I don't say that about many
people and let me say this as clear as
clearly as it can
white people are awful white
people suck I'll tell you they they will
immediately run to their little cave and
and start yelling at anybody to get an
advantage white people are pretty close
to a hate group at this point
but how about the Press
is the press a hate group
I would say yes
I would say the the left leading press
is a hate group against the right and I
would say the right-leaning press has
got some stuff to answer for too
might might be a little bit too much
Haiti if you know what I mean so I'm not
going to let the left or right off the
hook I believe they both present
click bait news to their people
and how is it not going to be racially
charged how is it not
you can't really help it
so I think the Press is a group I think
white people are a group but of course
in all things uh since I I hope most of
you are not NPC are there any NPCs
watching non-player characters
because I I'll present this differently
for the NPCs it has to be simplified for
them
but uh
for the rest of you I'll keep it
keep it more nuanced all right then I
also saw that Dean Obadiah Obadiah do
you know
I can't pronounce his last name so do
you know what his role is on CNN usually
do you recognize the name if you were
not a student of the news you would
think hey here's this prominent person
who's saying bad things about Scott
Adams so that's probably true
but would you be aware that Dean is Dean
obadia
is who they send out when they just want
somebody to say crazy
he's basically their attack dog for a
crazy
if the only thing you knew is that Dean
Obadiah was against me and you were also
a student of the news you would conclude
that I was right without even hearing my
argument
it's sort of like the worsted Watergate
guy
you know when CNN sends the worse than
Watergate guy out you know it's fake
news
they don't get the worst of the
Watergate guy out unless it's fake news
they don't ask Dean obladaya to write a
depending piece
unless it's fake news
we'll hide that user
um so he's he's like this great you know
Shining
bright light that says whatever this guy
says is the opposite of true because
that's his role I mean his actual role
is to spew that's like I don't
know that that I don't think it's his
job description
but it's clearly the role he's been
filming for years
yeah and I'll make a distinction
somebody like Wolf Blitzer is there to
report the news and I suspect he tries
you know hard to report it straight
that's a different situation
all right how about this uh
the New York Times uh also dunked on me
is the New York Times a source of real
news or fake news
real or fake New York Times
yeah any anybody who actually follows
the news business knows that they are
basically a source of fake news
somewhat consistently again only on
political stuff
political and also uh weapons of mass
destruction stuff which I guess is
political in a way
we'll get rid of the this troll got a
lot of trolls today
I'm attracting a lot of energy yeah the
New York Times is a fake news
organization in fact they were one of
the main
perpetrators of it is fake news to say
that the lab leak came from Wuhan so the
New York Times was slapping that down as
fake news when in fact they were the
fake news
um I'm giving you so the first thing you
need to know
is that the well let me
um let me tell you how the Cascade goes
so there's a Cascade effect when the the
notion of canceling somebody comes up so
I'll tell you how the Cascade worked in
my my case
there were of course individuals who
were complaining but the people making
the decisions
were the ones who are politically lined
against me
would anybody disagree with that well
let me give you some context
so far nobody prominent on the right has
criticized me except for maybe the way I
said it
there's nobody on the right who
disagrees with the content of what I
said after they've seen it in context
would you agree that nobody on the right
not black not white nobody black or
white
on the political right has disagreed
with my uh my point but some have
disagreed with the way I said it which
is actually valid do you know why it's
valid that they disagree with the way I
said it
do you know why I'm agreeing with that
because the way I said it was to provoke
and they're saying you shouldn't have
provoked
and I'm saying
I hear you that what I did provoked
but if you think I shouldn't have done
it then you're probably a cowardly
who doesn't want to speak truth and is
afraid of it
so there's that
anyway I don't expect to be monetized
today so we'll see how this goes but let
me tell you how the Cascade goes so
first the people were politically
aligned against me coincidentally
are also the cancellers oh
coincidentally they're politically
aligned against me but only the people
who are politically aligned against me
now it starts with only that right
so do you think this is about race
if it were about race don't you think
black conservatives would have something
to say about me
do you think black conservatives don't
know what racism is because they're
conservative
that's not a thing black conservatives
know what racism is
does anybody disagree with that
statement
and they looked at the situation and
they said well sub-optimal the way you
said it
but yeah we get your point
right now you're also seeing uh Megyn
Kelly was made a strong point
Newsweek actually said I shouldn't be
canceled did you see that today
so an article on Newsweek said they
shouldn't be canceled
and that it was racist to cancel me
interestingly so there will be a little
turret in the news anyway so first the
Cascade starts with people who are
clearly more politically motivated than
racially motivated and you can know that
because the conservative blacks
didn't have the same problem it's
clearly lined up by politics not by race
and so that's the beginning of the
Cascade and then the Cascade goes to the
people who don't know me
so they don't know anything about me
they're just being introduced
and they don't know the context
so if the newspaper say hey he did this
bad thing the people who don't know me
personally which would you know debunk
it just by that and the people who don't
know my context
and also 50 of the country thinks that
the news is real
they still think it's real
all right
um so then they join on because they
don't know that they don't know me and
they don't know the story but they get
pretty mad then you get what I call the
dopamine gooners
the dopamine gooners are really easy to
identify on Twitter
they're the people who seem to be
enjoying the hell and of destroying my
life
maybe they're politically you know on
the other side maybe it's just because I
was successful maybe it's just because
they're horrible horrible people but you
can tell they're enjoying it
so you can't really take that group
seriously can you
okay can you take can you take seriously
a group that's tweeting with one hand
and using the other hand for something
else I mean that's purely a pleasure
that's a pleasure Loop that has nothing
to do with me or what happened and I
think it's independent of me in some
ways because they're just looking for
the new thing to beat off to basically
so there so first you have the political
people who cancel me then the people who
don't know the story who join in that he
got the dopamine gooners who are just
enjoying the attack
uh then you have the next level is where
it gets bad so the next part of the
Cascade is what I'll call the innocent
bystanders who get caught in the
crossfire
in this case the innocent bystanders
included my syndication company
so the company that was Distributing to
the newspapers and again I'll say this
again
my syndication company has been great
like from the first contact with them
you know decades ago just a real quality
organization one of the best
organizations I've ever
had any contact with
but they didn't have a choice right the
the pressure was on so they're in the
innocent bystander I would say victim I
would say they're victims of this but
they have to do what they have to do now
I haven't talked to anybody at my
publisher but
um so I don't know if they were buying
into the narrative or or if they were
just called the crossfire
um then you get apparently there's a
bubble in New York City
the New York City Liberals are just
insane about this story so because most
publishing has a strong New York City
Connection it's impossible for
Publishers to support me at this point
it's just impossible the the the fact
that my business had any concentration
that involved New York City especially
the publishing part
uh makes it just impossible there's no
rationality going on there at all
right so that's the New York City
crazies and then you get the race
grifters
so a lot of a lot of the news cycle is
is run by the race grifters and
interestingly two race grifters from the
uh the anti-Semitic
world have come over to to join in the
attack because they're race grifters so
the race grifters have to get in on any
of these topics right and they're always
going to be on the same side yeah Al
Sharpton I think Al Sharpton weighed in
today so all of the race grifters get in
but the funny part is
that Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL
like the the Jewish Community I think
was feeling left out
because I said literally nothing about
them whatsoever and I'm one of the
biggest supporters of the Jewish
Community huge supporter of Israel and I
think they were just left out because
the grifters like all the the black race
grifters were like having a heyday and
they're like ah this is good and the the
Jewish race grifters were like hey I got
to get in on this so they looked around
and they found something long ago that
I'd said essentially it must be really
hard to count the number of dead from
the Holocaust
so whether it's 5 million or 10 million
this is the same story right it doesn't
change anything if you're off by half a
million right nothing changes
but that got turned into Holocaust
denier
is there anybody thinks you could count
accurately all the dead from World War
II in any category you know whether it's
the Jewish dead or any other dead do you
think you can get an accurate count
for World War II
now now of course I'm saying this again
and that'll that'll get turned into uh
he's Holocaust denier who I've never met
anybody who denied the Holocaust have
you
have you ever even met like a real
person who denied that it even happened
you actually have some people have all
right well I've never even met one I've
never even met one to me it's just crazy
but so today I'm being accused of that
because the race grifters like felt left
out so they had to throw in some new
stuff
I'm waiting for the gender grifters have
you noticed that the gender grifters
have been silent
I don't know why I was expecting more
gender grifters to get in here and say
well he said that one time that thing
one time
all right
so
um so then after the race grifters get
in you get the NPCs so the NPCs are the
people who are operating at the lowest
level of politics and I'm going to give
you the uh five things that the NPCs say
because they can't understand any nuance
uh they say I made a racist rant
if you don't say why I said it or you
don't put it in the context that the
whole point was to get away from racists
you're an NPC
there's just no way around if that's
your level of understanding of this
story
and you don't know that I was talking
against hate and against discrimination
and then the the news reversed it if you
don't know that you're an NPC
uh the others the the other NPC is
complaining that that I'm complaining
about being the victim
that is the most NPC thing you can say
about this he's complaining about being
the victim
first of all
have I complained
when did I complain
I've described but that's the news the
the headline is the news right I'm
telling you what happened
how is telling you what happened
being a victim
and by the way
I would say the victims here are Black
America
I would say the victim of this story is
Black America did Black America get a
better reputation because of this
do black Americans look better
because of this
I don't think so
I think this was a black eye for black
Americans only on the left is remember
the black Americans on the right who
looked at the context they were fine
they're like hey Free Speech you know
maybe I wouldn't decide it that way but
I get your point right they're fine
um
so I think black Americans who lean left
are the victims of this
now those of you who've known me for
years answer this question you won't see
the same answers on on the locals
platform but as to this question yes or
no
I have been a strong Ally of black
Americans for years very prominently yes
or no
100 yes on locals
how about YouTube now YouTube you don't
know me as well
but the ones who think yes check check
the other comments
because there aren't that many people
would be trolls or lying about it right
now when you read any of the news
stories did you see this context
and do you think it's an important
context that I've been one of the
strongest allies
of Black America for years four years
I mean I supported Colin Kaepernick I
worked with black lives matter trying to
make a difference I supported prison
reform I mean you could go right down
the line I actually wrote in favor of
reparations but not not the way it's
formulated today
um
right and I and I've personally invested
America would be the biggest benefactor
which is a big reason it's worth doing
because I think that's you know the
biggest hole and the most important
thing to fix
now if you take my voice away is Black
America better or worse
I mean you know who's the victim
I'm still rich
I'm still rich but the people I was
trying to help they're
because they're not going to get the
same help or are they
or are they
because
we're going to get provocative here in a
minute
we're going to get provocative
all right so um here's something you'll
see NPC say uh uh First Amendment
doesn't apply these are private
companies making decisions when did I
when did I complain about
that distinction
now in the real world if you're not an
NPC
there's of course the the legal First
Amendment free speech and everybody
knows that that doesn't apply to private
companies but the reality is that the
private companies are such Gatekeepers
that it's it's as if it's the same
so the NPC can't understand that even
though it's not technically true
it's as if it's the same
if you can be shut up by various you
know private entities what good does
Free Speech do you what the hell are you
going to do with your free speech if you
can't use any means of communication
so of course that's it's the same thing
in practice
uh others say that I should stop
complaining which I haven't done I
haven't complained not once
um
because I'm the cause of my own problems
do you think I'm not aware that I
triggered all of this
now I would say there are lots of broken
things in the world that contributed to
the outcome
but certainly in terms of responsibility
that's all me
did anybody hear me not take
responsibility for my own actions
is that me that's literally the opposite
of everything I've ever said my entire
whole life
now I take responsibility for my action
100
100 I own it and you haven't heard me
apologize have you have I apologized to
anybody
nope I own my opinion
and I'm the only person in the world
that can do that right now
because I'm willing to pay the price
you can't afford it I don't recommend it
all right
um here's what I learned in in sort of
trying to educate myself about what
works and what doesn't
and this is a gross generalization
and therefore it does not apply to all
people
so the NPCs won't be able to hear that
part they're going to say why are you
saying that's true of all those people
after I said I'm not not referring to
all the people
but they'll still say that it goes like
this
black Americans don't want advice from
white Americans
true or false
now again this is an over generalization
right there are plenty of black
Americans who have literally asked me
for advice
and almost all of them have gotten it I
think maybe all of them
right
so this is not about individuals
this is sort of a group and and by the
way I respect that
I respect that
because do white Americans understand
what's going on in the black community
maybe like a little but not much
like I feel like that's an actual
completely valid thing to say
how about now what is what is it that
black Americans do want
what do they want if they don't want
white advice because you know why they
don't want white advice
it sucks
it sucks let me give you some white
advice
all right I wrote down some good white
advice here's why maybe it's not so good
here's some good white advice uh change
your culture
oh there's some good advice
I'm going to go right out and go do that
how about uh stay married or it's the
welfare state
now these things these things all have
some element of truth right
it's just that they're not actionable
do you get that
these sound like you know it sounds in
some cases they're just racist
statements but even if you're trying to
be helpful like even even if there's
somebody who's non-racist who says oh
we've got to help the culture how would
you do that
how do you do that
this is a useless piece of advice
am I right
it to me it's useless
you see the problem is that if you make
the distinction between what's true
and what's useful I mean you have to
make that distinction it might be true
that the culture has an impact
but if it's not a lever you can move
look for something you can actually make
a difference it's not going to make any
difference like what do you do wake up
and change your culture like how does
that work
all right and how about you know stay
married
has that helped for how many years have
Democrat or Republicans said you know
family unit is important stay married
has that ever helped
that's never helped right it's only
going in the other direction
so it's true advice
like if you could magically stay married
that would be a good idea but we don't
have magic so this is not useful advice
this is dumbass white advice this is
just dumbass white advice
totally it's just political it's just
political thinking and then words come
out of your mouth and they might even be
based on something true
doesn't matter
it doesn't matter at all because it's
not useful it's just completely not
useful
all right how about and then there's uh
observations about the welfare estate
and maybe it rewards people for not
being married there's probably something
to that right
do you think we're going to fix that
how do you fix it not give help to
people who are single and have a kid
I mean we're not going to stop doing it
so you got to find something that works
that isn't dumbass white advice
this is just really dumbass advice it's
terrible
so if you ask what do blacks want again
this is not all black Americans there's
great diversity within black Americans
but there's one answer I hear more than
another
that what black people want from white
people is not advice definitely not
advice
is money
is money
because you can't fix anything without
money
right now I'm not talking about
reparations specifically although that
would fit within money of course but
black Americans say we can take care of
it now this would be more of a
conservative take but we can take care
of it but it will require some funding
you know then there'll be a lot of work
at the local levels and stuff and we'll
take care of it
I complete with that
is that working
like I don't see that working do you
basically nothing's worked
no white advice is ever worked and for
whatever reason Black America seems to
be not being able to capitalize on the
fact that white Americans would give
them money
if if there's something that's worth
funding they asked to make sense
would white Americans fund school choice
it's already happening do you know why
it's a good idea
that's all it's a good idea
so you can get funding for anything
that's a good idea can you get funding
for something that's a bad idea well
sometimes but it's harder
so if all if all the Black America has
is bad ideas bad ideas suggested by
white people the worst of them
and then bad ideas only in the sense
that whatever they're doing isn't
working yet right so I don't have
details on why it doesn't but it's not
so there's basically nothing working at
the moment so since uh I believe that
black Americans do not need advice from
white people
I'm not going to give them any
but I'm going to make some observations
my observations would apply to all
people
so not not all black people but all
people
so I'm going to make some general
observations about what works and what
doesn't
all right
here's what works
for everybody
however there would be a great many
details that are being left out and uh
those are the details that I think black
Americans would need to work out without
a whole bunch of bad white advice
basically everybody who succeeds no
matter what their color or what their
situation they do it the same way they
avoid crime they avoid getting addicted
to drugs or alcohol they don't have kids
before they can afford it and staying
married is of course a big Advantage
they focus on learning not just in
school but forever just adding skills
adding skills all the time and then they
exhibit character which is basically
doing what you say you're going to do
which is pretty much it right just doing
what you say you're going to do and if
you do these five things
whether you're white or black in America
you're going to come down okay
but here's the problem is this
actionable
it takes more than this to make all this
work like you need to have some kind of
situation where it's easier to avoid
addiction and easier to stay on a crime
and I think Black America is starting
like way behind
because of systemic racism would you
agree would you agree that systemic
racism
and especially the effect on the school
system through the teachers unions
puts black Americans way too often in
situations where it's hard to do the
things that everybody does
it's harder for them to do the things
that everybody does to succeed but it
should be known
that they should all learn this these
five
so well that sounds like advice I'll
make an observation
if if a black kid does not learn that
everybody who does these things succeeds
just about everybody
that would be a huge huge disadvantage
do you think white people learn this
what do you think do you think white
people learn these five tricks for
success
I think so the answer is yes
I think yes now some of that is the
luxury that you did not have systemic
racism weighing you down right but if
you're around successful people which I
would argue is one of the biggest
negative impacts of systemic racism is
that white people are a little more
likely statistically
to have a contact with somebody who has
also succeeded in an important way if
you're in a low-income neighborhood you
might not even know anybody successful
except a drug dealer or a pimp so what
are you going to look up to
if you put me in that situation I
couldn't get out
I would be an awesome drug dealer
I might be the best drug dealer ever but
I don't think I could get out like if
you put me in the same situation
all right
and here's my second
observation
so the first observation is if you're
not doing that stuff you really don't
have a chance so that's a good framework
of just figuring out
what you doing
all right
secondly I would say this of all people
all right this is applicable to Black
America but is a general statement of
all people
it goes like this
a success strategy there are two kinds
of success strategies one focuses
backwards and one focuses forwards
a backwards examples would be if you're
focusing on the causes of your current
situation you know historical racism and
if you're looking at CRT ESG and Dei
these are programs for companies in
education which focus on the victim
frame the victim frame is always
backwards looking
right yeah if the way you talk about
your situation is as a victim or as the
the legacy of things from the past that
is a backwards Focus
now
what is the importance of black history
for Americans
critical critical black history needs to
be taught to everybody right black
history needs to really be a a major
educational uh you know variable but
there's a difference between education
and making sure that your history is
correct and it is taught well there's a
big difference between that and focus
so we're not talking about history yes
or no history yes is the only answer
history yes we we have to have history
but you don't have to focus on it as
your strategy for success
now I was listening to Black
conservatives on the spaces recently and
one of the things that I noted was how
often they talked about the past
I don't know how I don't know how
prevalent that is so I don't know if it
was just that group because again
everybody knows black Americans are
widely diverse
but I worry so this is an observation
it's not advice I worry that this
mindset couldn't work for anybody
like you could replace black Americans
with any other group
just say here's your strategy for
Success we want you to really focus on
the bad things that happen to you
focus on who did it to you and then make
sure that the people who did it to you
are paying a little extra to make things
right
this is a strategy that wouldn't work
for anybody anywhere and anytime
however
it totally works temporarily
and that's the problem
it totally feeds the the race grifters
because people make money selling all
this all right this is this is a
commercial product
so as long as the race grifters are
moving your focus backwards
you're never going to succeed
this isn't advice
this is an observation nobody white
black old young nobody anywhere can
succeed with this mindset this is a
losing mindset
absolute losing mindset let me let me
compare that with a winning mindset and
by the way I believe this is a legacy of
systemic racism all right those of you
who are primed to be racists
I'm not saying anything about black
people
that's not what I'm talking about is
strategy right black people
are the victims of systemic racism and
so
there's probably a history that causes
them to be a little bit more backwards
focused you could understand that right
okay you put yourself in the in the in
the shoes of black Americans
how would you not Look Backwards
how would you ever have enough
discipline to say all right the past is
the past I'll just go forward
very very hard right so that's another
cost of systemic racism
what would be a a successful strategy
again not for black people specifically
for everybody
no exceptions all human beings
everywhere every age every ethnic group
focusing on the Future Works
it's just better and that means optimism
even when it's not uh not rational do it
anyway it means having a system more
than a goal doing something every day to
improve your situation even without a
specific goal goals are good but you
need a system more than that
affirmations you know Imagining the good
future so you can work toward it and
future talk
future talk means that when you're when
you're interacting you talk about the
future
and that's pretty much going to work
better than the past focus in the long
run
every time
in the short run you can get a lot of
money out of this this model which is
the problem that in the short run it
kind of works you can guilt people into
you know going to your side
so
none of that is advice
none of that is advice
because I really I do believe that white
people giving advice to black people is
just a mistake
I don't think it's received in the right
sense I don't think we have the right
context I don't think we understand that
the multiple different cultures but I
can make an observation
and my observation is everybody who
takes the the back focus view fails
everybody who looks ahead and builds
their talent stack and you know does the
five things for success
unless a meteor hits you you're going to
be fine
you know you'd have to have terrible
luck to not make that work
now
when you look at a successful uh black
person in America
how many of the five things for success
and the forward-looking optimistic
things how many of those do you see
present all of them all of them right
pretty much every successful black
person in America has sort of an
optimistic forward-looking you know
focus of course knows everything about
history but they have a focus on the
future and they do the five things
and then they do fine
it works every time
all right
um and that ladies and gentlemen
is what you want to cancel
so for the Washington Post
question is this do you want to see less
of this
what should I do
should I do more of this which is what
I've been doing for years trying to be
useful or should I do less of it because
I should be canceled for being a damn
racist because the fake news produced
some fake news to cancel me for largely
political reasons
what should I do
all right
so you weren't expecting that this
morning and I'm going to say goodbye to
the YouTube people we'll uh and on that
note and I'll talk to you all tomorrow
