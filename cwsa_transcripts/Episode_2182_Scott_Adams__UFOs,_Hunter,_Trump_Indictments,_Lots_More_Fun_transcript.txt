fix a little technical problem over in
the locals platform
but looks like the locals platform is
better than a door nail today
I'll try it one more time
hey he's looking better
not so much
well we're uh we're having a terrible
time here technically normally I'd be
halfway through the simultaneous sip but
it looks like we got nothing today
so we'll be closing up
closing up locals
and open it up on my phone
which should work
but we'll see
watch me scramble to make all this work
while you wait wishing there was
actually a show going on
yeah it looks like locals is dead
all right
today
it's all you it's all you today
would you like to start from the
beginning
good morning
would you like to take this experience
up to levels that you don't even believe
are possible
yes you do
and all you need for that is a cupboard
mugger gloss a tanker Chelsea style in
the canteen chocolate flaska vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamines
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
that's good stuff
all right ladies and gentlemen
have you seen any news today
well there's news all over the place
it's like news happening like you can't
even believe it
but uh let's go through it
so the Wall Street Journal is saying
that the economy grew by 2.4 percent
we'll talk about Hunter and UFOs and
stuff but it'll take a minute for all
the locals people to give up and come
over here
sorry
um
but what I thought was interesting about
this is it's good news that the economy
is doing well
but the headline was uh
U.S economic growth defies a slow down
expectations
whose expectations
whose expectations because this was my
prediction so I would like to add to my
most accurate political predictions and
most accurate pandemic predictions and
most accurate Ukraine predictions the
most accurate economic tradition
because I actually said we would not go
into a recession there we go
remember I told you I I was all excited
preliminarily yesterday about this story
that researchers had made a room
temperature superconductor
do you remember that story
took about 10 minutes for people to crap
all over it and say well let's wait to
see if anybody can reproduce this and
there's something sketchy going on and
so I would say that all of my optimism
about superconductivity completely gone
completely gone yeah it doesn't sound
like it's real but I would love to be
surprised so don't wait for any room
temperature
superconductivity it might be as likely
as
UFOs
well there's a new photo of uh
uh Wagner leader progosian
allegedly in Russia and he's just
shaking hands with some African guy
who's visiting
so that's true right
pregosian's fine he's just hanging out
hanging out in Russia
sure
yeah there was a even CNN reported that
they reported that there was a picture
of him they didn't report to use the
library thing they just said there's a
picture of him which is fair
and
uh does anybody want to think that he's
still free and just doing his own thing
he's just driving his RV around St
Petersburg
no no he's not driving his RV around the
CPS
he's certainly in uh if he's alive he's
certainly controlled by Putin at this
point
um
did you read it in the news that it was
the warmest summer
how many of you think we had the warmest
summer because of climate change the
news said so
well it may be it might actually be the
warmest summer but
I'd like to give you a Counterpoint
which doesn't it doesn't necessarily
refute everything you've heard but it
gives you context so here's some better
context from Alex Epstein
uh you said anyone comment uh
commentating responsibly on summer
temperatures must acknowledge four facts
all right see if you agree with these
four facts
cold related deaths are much greater
than he related to us do you know that
that the number of people who died
because it's too cold is way higher than
the number of people who die because
it's warm
so in theory
you could imagine that depending on
where it got warmer
it would save lives right so as the cold
places got warmer but the places that
are already hot didn't get warmer or
didn't get much warmer we'd be better
off wouldn't we well and then then the
reverse would be true if the hot places
got hotter and the cool places got
colder that probably would be worse
um
but according to Alex Earth is warming
slowly and less in warm places oh so
that's good so the warming is more
concentrated in the cold places
which should save lives
um fossil fuels number three fossil
fuels make us safer from dangerous
temperatures
yeah what would you do if you didn't
have fossil fuels
wouldn't you be more exposed to what the
weather can do if you can't sit in your
car or eat your house
and um
anti-fossil fuel policies increase the
danger from cold indeed well that makes
sense if fossil fuels protect you from
temperature extremes then not having
them would make you less safe
so I think a lot of this turns on these
two points it's better to be warmer than
cold
and it's
um
and it's not warming as much in the
places that are already warm now this is
my problem with averages
if somebody told you that the average
temperature the Earth was going up
that's pretty scary right but what if
they told you that it's warming up in
the places that are too cold
and the places that are already hot
nobody lives there because it's a desert
anyway
for example now that's the extreme
that's I'm exaggerating the effect here
but uh
that's your counter argument
so I'm not saying that the warming the
warming is not a problem
I don't know might be but we're pretty
good at dealing with that kind of
problem
all right here's a quiz for you and the
answer is not 25 percent
all right I'm going to see I can see if
you can get this right
you know put on your thinking gaps all
right there was a article by Katie mogg
in the Wall Street Journal and
apparently there's a trend called the
hashtag lazygirljob
and a lazy girl job would be defined as
a job often you could work at home you
don't put in too many hours it might be
an online kind of thing you don't make
that much money but you make enough
especially if you live with your
boyfriend or something
so apparently it's this big old trend
um to
have a job that you can just sort of
pay the rent but you're not looking to
kill you know kill it this would be the
opposite of leaning in
this would be like sleeping in
so apparently leaning in has turned into
sleeping in
uh but that's not the question here's
the question
this phenomenon has been growing lately
and it's racked up close to 18 million
views on a particular social media
Network go Which social media Network
well just a hypothetic well what would
be a social media Network that would
encourage working age humans in the
United States do not work hard
but maybe not send that same message to
let's say China
what what would be
what would be a platform that would do
that
I mean who would tell Americans to be
lazier because it's awesome while not
telling Chinese citizens to be lazy
because it's not awesome who would do
that
the answer is
tick tock
are you surprised
oh big surprise a trend that's really
bad for Americans seems to be running on
Tick Tock which does not run in the same
form in China
so why are people talked into being
trans if they never thought of it in
their life before Tick Tock but not in
China they don't run it there
and why are people told to not work so
hard
well it doesn't happen in China
and
what is uh what's Congress looking at
this week
the fact that it's obvious that we have
a brainwashing technology that's been
inserted in the phone of every Young
American
or we have a hearing on that today no no
it's about aliens UFOs
because it's summer and you don't talk
about real stuff in the summer you fool
let's talk about UFOs
as you know the Congress had some
hearings about whether the government
has secret UFOs that they're keeping
from us and I don't know about you
but after listening to some of the
testimony about the UFOs
I'm left with more questions than
answers
more questions than answers here are
some of the questions I have
how much money did Hunter get from the
UFOs
I assume you shall come down I just
don't know how much money he made
there's no reporting on that number two
are we using this Advanced alien
technology that we have to make video
cameras for the White House that can't
see Hunter
yeah Special technology the security
cameras can see everybody
except Hunter he's just invisible on
camera
and most importantly number three how
many aliens are in Trump's boxes
must be a few because one thing we know
is that we can't be told what's in the
boxes
I can't think of anything else that they
wouldn't tell us
because anything else they could tell us
am I right they could tell us in a
general way
again let me give you example if Trump's
boxes of Secrets had attack plans for
Iran
we would hear that they just wouldn't
tell us the details if there were
nuclear secrets
we would hear that they just wouldn't
tell us the actual Secrets right if he
had boxes that were full of let's say
sensitive conversations with a foreign
adversary or for an ally or maybe some
something that we'd found about a
foreign adversary
we would have heard that we just
wouldn't hear the details of it right
what's the one thing that could be in
the boxes
that even the government wouldn't even
say anything about
aliens aliens there have to be aliens in
the boxes because it's the only thing
they wouldn't want to say anything about
otherwise they would just say well yes
he hasn't we just can't tell you the
details but they can't tell you that
they do have aliens they just don't want
to tell you which ones see they can't
tell you that okay I'm joking if you
can't tell if you can't tell I'm joking
I'm joking all right
um
Elon Musk weighed in on a Andrew Tate
tweet
um then Tate was talking about you know
men who sleep with a lot of women and
vice versa and musk tweeted to that he
said to sleep with women endlessly
without love is a cursed and hollow life
well
if you were not already aiding Elon Musk
for being the richest person in the
world
can you he can you hate him now for
apparently knowing the answer to this
question
how you feel when you have slept with
endless women without love
it didn't sound like he was guessing
I feel like if you're the richest man in
the world and you're unmarried you have
experienced sleeping with endless women
without love
I think that's probably what a Tuesday
looks for him looks like for him
sending number three
make sure there's no love
so we hate him for knowing the answer to
that question what does it feel like to
have sex with endless women
you know but but I'm glad that he did it
so we don't have to do it am I right
guys are you glad that Elon Musk
told us what it feels like to sleep with
endless women without love because I was
going to go out and do it
I had plans for the week I was like you
know what I'm going to do this week I
haven't tried this before but I'm gonna
try having endless sex with women who
don't love me
see what it's all about but then I would
have found out it was cursed in all her
life and so I'm glad that must did it so
I don't have to but there is something
left out of this analysis
they're sleeping with women endlessly
without love is a cursed and hollow life
how does it compare to being married to
one person
I mean I think that's the valid
comparison
I would agree with them that maybe it
isn't you know a cursed and hollow life
but how does it compare to the
alternative
you know what is the worst advice
anybody ever gave
the worst advice is Follow Your Passion
you know you know what the second worst
advice is
find a find a good mate
it's the worst device anybody's ever
given find a good mate you know one that
will make your life better and do you
know why that's the worst advice in the
world
because I'm no expert I'm not a marriage
expert I'm just going to put this out
there
see you can do with it what you will
I'm almost positive
that a hundred percent of people who get
married
think they picked the right one
do you have a different feeling about
that are there a lot of people getting
married saying you know this mate I
picked is total but I just feel
like getting married
no I believe that everybody enters an
illusion in which they figure that
whatever flaws the other person has
they'll they'll work it out
and there are no new flaws there won't
be any new ones you've seen everything
there is to see
and so that therefore a reasonable and a
smart person using good judgment can go
out and find a good solid mate and have
a solid life because of it
now some of you say it was cut you
 idiot you idiot there are plenty
of examples I mean maybe it's not over
50 percent of the population but there
are plenty of plenty of examples of
people who looked and they found the
right person
are you going to tell me that would you
would you like to tell me that there are
many examples you've seen it yourself
many of you are the example where the
the correct mate which you wisely and
with your good judgments and your free
will you chose that good mate and
because of your good choice things are
better for you how many years raise your
hand if you're in that category you were
you wisely picked the right mate and it
totally worked out for you go how many
of you
so and there and therefore would be a
good technique right yeah
all right does anybody see what's wrong
with your analysis do I have to be the
first one to tell you
you see what's wrong with the analysis
all right you take a million people and
you randomly pair them with each other
just randomly
would some of them uh have happy
marriages
just randomly paired
what do you say
of course they would of course they
would yeah suppose you had an AI match
people
would you know if you had a million of
them would some of them have amazing
marriages
I think so I think so yeah does that
does that indicate that you can choose
the right mate
because lots of people have done it
Alexa cancel
I don't know what that was all about but
so so would you say that the evidence is
there there are plenty of examples of
people who consciously and this is the
important part they were consciously
looking for a good mate
they found one they lived their whole
life happy that they found one and
that's proof that it's a good idea would
you agree with that statement
is basically solid well maybe not proof
in a scientific sense but it's very
solid solid evidence
because you know lots of people you
personally know lots of people who put
the effort in found somebody and it
worked and it worked their whole life
and they were really happy about it
right
that's not that's not really thinking
what you're doing there
there's no there's no sense of reason or
logic to that whatsoever
it's just the law of big numbers
if you have a lot of people doing
something somebody's going to win
that's it that's the whole story if a
lot of people are doing a thing
some of them are going to get lucky
every time not sometimes every time
so what would you imagine would be the
rate of people getting lucky that would
indicate his luck
versus something that would indicate
it's a solid plan
well let me give you an example another
solid plan would be if you wanted a good
life you would stay in the jail you'd
learn some skills uh
you know you'd basically
stay off drugs do some things how often
does that keep you from being poor
if you do those few simple things that
anybody can do it's hard but anybody can
do it and the answer is
almost no poor people in that group
if you you know build skills go to
school stay in a jail do the basics
pretty much all of you are successful
what's the success rate for picking a
spouse
now remember you've got to you you're
not discounting the people who get
divorced you have to include the people
who stayed married but kind of wish they
hadn't
right
so so marriage is more of a maybe I'd
say a 25 success rate
if you talk about your whole life 25
percent
does 25 percent sound like chance
or the result of people who knew exactly
what they were doing they knew exactly
what a good mate would look like and
they went out and tried to get one
does it look like that
have you ever noticed that people tend
to marry the people they work with
what are the odds you met your soulmate
at work
it's mostly where people meet people
right
the thing we know of people about people
is that they can fall in love with
whoever's around
would you agree with that statement
we're not looking for our soulmate among
the 8 billion people on earth
we easily fall in love with whoever's
nearby
just proximity seems to be enough so do
you how many of the people who just fell
in love because they happen to be in the
proximity of another person who is
willing to you know say yes
how many of them are a good match
it would be kind of weird if they were
so I would say that 25 success rate of
picking the right mate and making it
last a lifetime
could be a little more could be a little
less it's definitely not over 50 percent
so what kind of advice is it to give
somebody advice that could not work more
than half the time
is that a solid advice
advice that will not work
at least half of the time
I would call that bad advice
because you do not have a mechanism or
the capability to pick a good mate
now I suppose there's some really super
obvious stuff like you know somebody
who's been in and out of jail their
entire life
and it was no intention of stopping
crying I wouldn't marry that person
right
but I don't think that's what anybody's
talking about I think most people are
looking at average looking people
and saying I think that's my person I
think that's the one that will work but
it's not because they're so smart or
they knew how to pick a good person
yeah no I think it's pure magical
thinking that you can pick the right
person that said that said you should
try as hard as you can to pick the right
person
I'm just saying it's magical thinking to
think that's some kind of formula for
Success it's not
something you should try to do but you
really don't know how to do it nobody
does
uh because it's mostly luck
all right
um there's yet another
announcement about AI movies and now
this Gen 2
I don't know if it's hn or Gen 2 or
whatever it is but there's some new AI
that
can make movies make an entire movie
just from some prompts
um here's my prediction about movies
made by AI
do you know why I don't watch television
right now
besides the fact the content is bad is
because there are so many streaming
services and each one takes a lot of
effort to make it work on any given day
like I've got streaming services that
work on some some devices but not others
I could probably fix that
but I sometimes I just want to watch a
show
so I'll just go to the other streaming
device
so I've got all these streaming devices
and as I've said many times instead of
watching content which is what I used to
do now I just look for content and I'm
sure that there's something better I
haven't found yet and then I never watch
any content
so the amount of content
made watching content impractical
would you agree you understand what I'm
saying right it's like going to The
Cheesecake Factory and they've got the
50 page menu
and you're sitting there with somebody
who's not good at making decisions about
food
it's don't go to The Cheesecake Factory
door Dash do not go there with somebody
who's not good with decisions you're
going to be there a long time
yeah would you like to see my impression
of going to The Cheesecake Factory
vegetarian page
all right see a fish vegetarian I'll do
the same thing I did last time good and
decision mate
and here's me for the rest of the 15
minutes
[Music]
that's me eating at the Cheesecake
Factory with anybody
um
so where was I going on that oh AI
movies I think when AI can make movies
everybody's going to make an AI movie
would you agree
the moment you can make a movie just by
typing in some text
there's going to be so many AI movies
how are you ever going to watch anything
do you think any of these AI movies are
going to be good
probably not I mean it's based on human
patterns and only want to have you know
a thousand movies are good
so it's not going to be better than one
in a thousand but you know it's going to
be different
there will be a billion of them
right when you go to look for a movie
there will be a billion
a billion movies
like actually a billion
and how many of those will be good maybe
none
maybe one in a thousand
how long are you going to look for the
good ones
how much time are you going to spend
looking for the good one now here's even
like a deeper a deeper analysis of this
uh years ago I made the mistake of
trying to become a script writer for
movies so I was going to make a Dilbert
movie and I you know read some books and
studied up on the structure of scripts
unfortunately that process ruined movies
for me forever
because once you know how a script has
to be written in order to make it onto
the screen
you realize it's a formula and if you
don't use the formula you're not going
to get it made nobody's going to fund it
because they need the formula that's
what works but once you see the formula
and you're like oh it's a three-act play
I get it this is the First Act we have
to go through somebody got hurt
something bad happened all right then
third act so and then you know that the
B plot interferes with the a plot you
know that anything you see that's called
out the First Act has to be important in
the last act or else they wouldn't call
it on the First Act and once you see the
whole process and the the structure it
doesn't look like art anymore
and when it stops looking like art it
loses all of its punch
so I would say that and other people
have had the same experience I've talked
to them the moment you can see the gears
you you lose all your love of the movies
I don't know how people make movies make
make movies and watch them because they
just should know too much maybe they
watch them for a different reason to see
how well they're made or something I
don't know
but once there are tons of AI mu movies
and they're all using the same formulas
that humans use and there's billions of
them I think this will destroy movies as
an art form
I just don't think movies will be a
thing
reels might be a thing
but not movies
and of course when I say that is more
like radio you know radio lasted forever
even though television was supposed to
get rid of it so there will be probably
some AI movies and other movies but you
know movies as a major cultural
phenomenon should shrink to a niche
all right
uh Democrats really don't like free
speech you know everybody says that but
when you see these numbers it's shocking
so Pew research or the Pew group or
wherever there found that Democrats and
Democrat leading Independents are much
more likely than Republicans and
Republican leaners
to support the U.S government taking
steps to restrict false information now
this isn't just free speech it's
specifically about false information
so 70 percent of Democrats and leaning
Democrats think the government should
restrict what is in their opinion false
information
and 39 of Republicans say the same
so before any of you Republicans get all
feeling good about yourself
39 percent of Republicans think the
government should restrict bad
information
really how did we get to this place you
see the problem is that this requires
somebody to know what information is
good
as soon as you you say somebody's going
to be the judge of what good information
is and what's bad information you're
dead
you are so dead if you let somebody
decide for you what's true
you cannot live in that world that is
the end
that's the end of the Republic
how do 70 percent of uh
Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans
not know
that allowing the government to tell you
what's true
would be the end of the Republic how do
they not know that
what's going wrong here
and my best guess is at least with the
Democrats is that they've been so
propagandized
that Republicans are are putting out bad
information
that they can't see that their own
information is bad as well
is that what's happening
would you say that the propaganda makes
them think that the only bad information
is coming from their enemies
they don't understand that the bad
information is coming from inside the
house
as they still don't know it even after
the pandemic
think about that even after the pandemic
when we've learned almost everything the
government told us was a known lie they
weren't just wrong they knew they were
lying
and yet
the Democrats 70 percent of them somehow
are not influenced by the fact that we
know the government lied to us massively
not only about that but everything from
the laptop to you name it and
and that doesn't have an influence
seventy percent of the Democrat leaders
and Democrats are not influenced by
recent events
they still want somebody to tell them
what's true or more importantly to tell
the other side what's true here's here's
my take on this I think this is
I think that it's just a team play
response I think that when people
answered the question they were
answering as Democrats
uh well I would like my enemies not to
talk as much I think that's what it is
but if you ask them if you I think if
you took any of these 70 percent and sat
him down and said what I just had just
the two of you talking not a poll say
all right you know that both sides have
put out bad information
well yes that's true right
and you know that if somebody in
particular is in charge of telling you
what's true
you know that you're in big trouble
right
yeah that's true I mean I don't think
anybody actually holds this opinion
isn't that weird people are giving
opinions they don't hold
because they they think you probably
have a Strategic Benefit I think so I
think people are just asking the
answering what would be a philosophical
question
I think they're answering it
strategically
partly what's happening
all right
um but is it more than just false
information wouldn't you say that
um there's also a suppression by the
left of opinion
don't you think that it's more than just
what's true or what's false
but that opinion is also being
suppressed you know stuff that's clearly
opinion
because some of the opinion is about
what's true and what's not true so you
end up blocking opinion
when you try to Black Block fact
all right
um
now it might be just because there's so
many Democrats who are unable to speak
in coherent sentences you got your
commonly Harris your Joe Biden your
fetamine your Senator Feinstein
Feinstein who
actually can't communicate anymore
but now we can add to that Mitch
McConnell if you saw Mitch McConnell's
tragic press announcement and he stood
there and actually couldn't speak
and he looked like he was having some
kind of an event in his head
uh he apparently can speak so he did
because he did come back but he's in bad
shape
so by my count that is five major
members of our government who can't form
sentences
is that right tell me I'm wrong there
are four elected people who are really
prominent these are not minor people
these are prominent politicians Kamala
Harris Joe Biden uh fetterman Feinstein
and now Mitch McConnell
how's this okay
how is this okay
I mean really
there's nobody who can tell Mitch
McConnell it's it's time
I'm uh I'm pretty disappointed in
Republicans
you know let me just say this if you're
a Republican or a conservative and
you've been saying that Joe Biden needs
to step down because of age
but you're not saying about Mitch
McConnell
then we can't take you seriously you're
not a real serious person both of them
need to step down
like really soon
yeah Grassley actually is weirdly
Grassley seems pretty capable doesn't he
relatively speaking but you know like
you said he's close
so
yeah I mean the the team play here is
just disgusting because none of these
people would be in power if people were
trying to pick good people
right so picky a good mate is like
picking a good politician
you have every good intention of doing
it but then you know there are reasons
there are reasons why you gotta pick
these bad ones
and we're going to use those raisins
speaking of bad ones
um Adam Schiff was at
Adam Schiff is so entertaining
because he
I don't know what's in his head
but it seems that he must be aware
that he can say anything
and the News won't check him on his side
you know only the Republicans will fact
check him and nobody he doesn't care
about them because his base and his
voters will never see it
so he said quote the Republican desire
to impeach someone anyone no matter if
there's any evidence just shows how they
have descended into chaos
right so the Republicans are crazy
because they want to impeach the person
who's in charge of the Border who's just
letting everybody in
that's crazy it's crazy to want to
impeach somebody who's just not doing
the job on a vital thing
and of course the Biden stuff is just
beyond the pale at this point
so at the same time there might be a
trump indictment today has there been
any news yet on a trump indictment don't
they usually happen in the morning
can we say there will be no Trump
indictment today
am I wrong that they always happen in
the morning
or is that just me imagining it
maybe I'm imagining that all right
but we'll keep waiting that so I tweeted
because I thought it was funny that uh
the news today has UFOs and the possible
Trump indictment uh that's got to tell
you the Hunter's in trouble
but then somebody pointed out to ruin my
fund that the UFOs are that's all the
Republican process
so the Republicans are not trying to
cover up any hunter stories but it is
funny that we get these two flashy
stories at the same time Hunter
Hunter is in trouble
all right coincidence anyway you all
heard by now that hunter lost his
sweetheart plea deal
now I'm no lawyer so I'm going to give
you the idiots version of what I
understand about this so Hunter had this
sweetheart deal worked out in which you
would plead guilty to some minor stuff
among a large bag of potential stuff
that could have been even worse
now that's unusual normally you would
you know plead guilty to
well let me take another tact on this
so the idea was
at least these smart people are saying
that it seems to have been crafted
explicitly to get Hunter off but more
importantly to prevent anybody from ever
finding out more information
and the way they would do that is have a
deal in which there's no trial so you
don't have the discovery of the trial
but moreover if the Press asks for asked
questions they would still be able to
say that the investigations are ongoing
so somehow they were going to say we've
made a deal and all the investigations
are closed while also saying they're
still open so we can't talk about it it
was some weird situation that
it was ridiculous on its surface
and was really transparent even to the
judge who overturned it because it
seemed obvious this this was so
non-standard it could only be put
together for the purpose of protecting
Hunter could not have been done in any
reasonable person's opinion for any kind
of Justice or you know normal process
that another person would go through
so here's my big question
is this going to unravel everything
will everything become Delight now
because
if Hunter can be prosecuted
doesn't that open up the the ability to
investigate everything related to it
which would necessarily include the
entire Biden criminal family
organization
and by the way I have no problem saying
it's a Biden crime family
because I think I think the evidence in
the news is now overwhelming
and
it seems to me that the uh the 20 shell
companies and the six Banks and all that
stuff
you could you could do away with all the
alleged audio tapes you know let's say
we never hear any of these alleged
Ukrainian audio tapes I don't think we
ever will
uh you could say that all the the
documents like that 1023 you could say
those are all fake
but all you need is to know that a huge
amount of money flowed from other
countries into a Labyrinth of shell
companies and banks that has no purpose
other than to hide your activity
and that's the whole that's the whole
story you don't need any documentation
all you have to do is show this flow of
money and the structure it flowed into
and then where it ended up
you know now now we do have direct
Witnesses right we've got the Devon
Archer and
Etc Tony bobolinski so we have we have
direct
uh eyewitnesses under oath
and we've got the bank records and the
money and where it went
right
now
although I would yeah you make a good
point I always say people are innocent
until proven guilty
but if I watch somebody shoot somebody
in my living room with my own eyes and
I'm standing right next to him I'm not
going to say that that person is
innocent
you know I don't need that I don't need
the court to validate it because I can
observe it directly this is one of those
cases where you can observe it directly
because
um Hunter's defense has offered no
explanation for why you would have all
these shell companies and Banks and even
what they did for the money you know
what was the product they gave for the
money without that I would say this is
as obvious as watching somebody murder
somebody right in front of you
and that that would be a real it's a
very rare exception to innocent until
proven guilty now somebody who
definitely should be innocent until
proven guilty would be Andrew Tate
because we don't really know anything
about that do we we know these
allegations but nothing nothing really
sounds right about any of it as Romania
you don't know if there's corruption so
edutate is the perfect example of
innocent until proven guilty
no matter what the truth is
whereas the this Hunter situation is was
so well understood
that I think you can you can go beyond
the the court opinion to have your own
opinion about it
now I would say that's different than
the Trump boxes
because the Trump box case
um
really relies on a lot of legal Theory
and who did what exactly when and I
would say that's innocent until proven
guilty I mean it looks like maybe there
were some technical violations that
nobody should care about but
yeah anyway
um
so we'll see what comes to that but it
does look like uh I would say there's no
chance of Joe Biden
um
being the next president
do you think there's any chance of that
now
because I think the evidence that we
have already would guarantee he can't
win against any Republican who's sane
and you're going to have you can have
strong Republicans going into the race
whoever it is you know it looks like
Trump at the moment
but no matter who it is you know any of
the top four is going to just destroy
Biden
I mean all you have to do imagine the
debate
imagine a debate in which Trump or
somebody says look we've discovered 20
shell companies six Banks and whatever
the number is 17 million dollars that
flowed into the family and no
explanation of what services were
provided for that
and no explanation of why you needed to
hide that money
Now ladies and gentlemen of America I
submit to you
that if they offered a defense
you should consider it they've now
offered a defense
and the the facts are no longer under
dispute
look with your own eyes see it with your
own eyes this is the swamp
this is what I'm trying to get rid of
and I'm trying to get rid of the head of
the swamp first let me take the head of
the snake and we'll worry about the rest
of the snake when I get elected but I
think all of you can see what I see
you know although I agree that people
are innocent until proven guilty there
is no other explanation for this money
flowing from other countries and from
the countries that were exactly the
portfolios that Biden was controlling in
terms of policy
so let's not get caught up into the
legal details you can all see the stuff
that nobody's arguing about
you can all see for yourself it's been
proven we have the documents the money
flowed from other countries there was no
there was no product or service provided
this is the swamp this is what you need
to get rid of
everybody wins in that case
yeah
now
I believe that the Democrats are
unwilling to rig the election for Biden
even if they could
and there's no evidence that they ever
did
but if they could hypothetically I don't
think they would
because I think they don't want him to
run
it's too much trouble
so even CNN you know is starting to run
some anti-biden commentary
all right so yeah I think I think uh
Biden's done that's my prediction my
prediction is that Biden uh can't win
so I'm going to go with doesn't matter
who does win
it matters but that's not part of the
prediction prediction is Biden will not
be president whether he gets whether he
gets the primary or not
he doesn't have I'd say any chance of
winning at this point
um
this will be a good test
have you heard anybody else say that
Biden can't win you know based on the
hunter stuff especially
as anybody in the
bunded space said because I think most
people are still on the page the
Democrats are thinking he can win
and Republicans are thinking he can win
because something will happen with the
election right where the Democrats don't
care if he's sentient or not
right so I
I don't know how many people have
predicted this if any I haven't heard it
from anybody but I'm going to say there
isn't any chance he can be president
again
so between his health and the hunter
stuff and the fact that the Democrats
don't want to put up with it again and
even CNN started to change his tune a
little bit on the reporting uh yeah now
remember you're saying that the cheating
can make him president I'm saying that
they wouldn't cheat in this case
because they don't want him to be
president
so if they were going to be cheating it
would make far more sense to put in a
better candidate ahead of time so you
don't have to cheat
see where I'm going if you imagine
there's such a thing
as some you know Democrat conspiracy to
cheat
they would be pretty well organized
would you agree if that existed and
there's no evidence of it but if it
existed they'd be well organized but
there would certainly be well organized
enough
to make sure they were not in that
position to make sure that Biden was not
running and I think they could make that
happen they they the imaginary people in
charge
so that's all just imagining that such
people exist maybe they do maybe don't I
don't know
all right um
how bad should we uh be about this I I
think we found something we can all come
together on
um and that's rare the left the right
black white
uh lgbtq there's one thing we can come
together as I think we can come together
as nation and universally condemn those
things that nobody ever said
can we agree
would you would you join with me and to
condemn
the terrible things that nobody's ever
said
for example nobody's ever said that
slaves had a good deal
nobody ever said that slaves were
benefiting by those you know in a way
that made slavery sort of a good deal by
having skills right nobody's ever
thought it nobody's ever said it
but the entire country is deciding to
argue over it the thing that nobody said
and nobody believes
am I wrong about that nobody said it
nobody believes it and we're having a
big argument about it the thing that
nobody said that nobody believes
so that's happening
but at least we can come together on
condemning the things that never
happened that nobody ever said
and the funniest part about that story
it's
um
you know the the topic is uh
uh history teaching in Florida and
whether it should
say that that the slaves were acquiring
skills they had some benefit to them
later on
and it turns out that the people who are
really mad about the DeSantis plan for
history lessons
uh want to replace it with a more
generic one that they're happy with
and do you know what the difference is
between the generic one that the unhappy
people would like to replace and the one
that DeSantis wants do you know what the
difference is
on this question
none it says the same thing
same thing that slaves learn skills
which they could take with them later
both you know during during slavery and
after and it would be better to have a
skill than not to have a skill
they both say that
not only is the entire debate about
something that nobody said
nobody said the part that that the
slaves had a good deal everybody said
the part that they learn skills and
everybody agrees that learning skills is
better than not learning skills
so
this is like a double triple absurdity
situation this is summer squared
stories that aren't real
but we're you know we have something to
talk about
all right I would like to give you the
best part of my presentation today which
is how to deal with the Republicans
mostly the Biden Camp if we're calling
Republicans extreme Mega
does it seem to you they're getting some
traction on this extreme Maga situation
does it feel like it's working
because it feels like other people are
picking it up
but I'm going to teach you a persuasion
trick
for removing extreme Mega from the
attack you ready
now it's not much different from other
techniques so you'll recognize the
technique as and embrace and amplify
but I'm tweaking Embrace and amplify a
little bit because Embrace and Amplified
means you just Embrace somebody's
dumbass idea and then you pretend you
you agree with it and and they're
pretending you agree
surfaces all the problem with the idea
this is a little bit different but it's
a close cousin to that all right imagine
a video skipped so it would be a viral
video using actors
all right the actors are a couple of
very Republican ordinary looking people
just like the most ordinary Republicans
you could have but let's say they're a
little bit overweight just so you can
imagine this I'm going to draw you a
picture in your head it's a little bit
overweight they're very middle class so
you see them in their living room
sitting on the couch
maybe mom is knitting or something and
Dad's there with a or a man's beer not a
Bud Light and they're watching the news
and you hear Joe Biden say something
about extreme Mega extreme Mega extreme
Mega and you see the two looking at each
other and they're like
well we're regular mega
what what would was that an upgrade is
that like a promotion
like I'd like to be more extreme
and so you see the two people trying to
figure out how they can get to extreme
and so they talk to their friends you
know it all happens really quickly
because it's like a quick video they
talk to their friends and they're like
we'd like to we'd like to be more
extreme
and they're like well
you could wear this you know this hat
that has embossed lettering on it like
is that extreme well compared to the
regular hat that has no embossed
lettering
is way more extreme
so you would do like little skits of
regular Republicans trying to become or
get upgraded to the excitement of being
an extreme Mega but they can't figure
out what is included
so they're trying to figure out how to
do it what's the process how do I get to
be more extreme and of course the point
of it is it's a ridiculous concept
there's no such thing as an extreme Mega
it's all made up
so you want to embrace it
so that you can mock it
that's different than Embrace and
amplify because when you Embrace and
amplify the mocking is sort of embedded
in your actions but you're not actively
mocking it you're pretending like you're
just playing it straight in this case
you would be actively mocking it
but you're embracing it before you
actively mock it
so close cousin of embrace and Amplified
now in my opinion the silliness of
extreme Mega
you could immediately take it from
extreme magazines like racist right
yeah crazy racist
but you can make extreme bag it just
seems silly and cute and ridiculous
just by having uh more attention to the
you know the counter point
what do you think
would it work
lots of videos of the extreme Mega and
then you also get you'd also want your
Republicans to make fun of it
you know can you imagine Vivek or you
know somebody who's got a personality
saying you know are you extreme Mega do
you agree with this because we Mega
there's an extreme Mega
wow is there any kind of a sign up for
that or is it more of a
self-identification how do I become more
extreme Mega
you know just and just just mock The
Thing by smiling and laughing at it you
know I don't think I'm extreme Mega
enough
I'm gonna you know or or how about this
all right here's another idea you show
somebody with a make America a great
again hat on you know the red hat and
then they're trying to figure out how to
become extreme and then one of them has
an idea
and they turn the head around backwards
and everybody's like I think you did it
that that's like crazy
oh my God my God could we do that too
how did you do that and then they're all
like
huh
and they turned their hats around
they're like
and suddenly they're all excited we've
done it we've done it and they they go
to have a drink but it's only Bud Light
they're like ah
[Music]
it'd be hilarious
you should make you should make 50 of
these we should use that AI
that's what you do uh so since now we've
been told and I'm sure it's true because
people said so that you can just write
text to create a whole movie
so you can just write some text to
create this little play of the Maga
people trying to be extreme Mega and
it'll be totally watchable because AI
made it right
no it won't if you want if you want to
if you want to show yourself that hey I
can't make a movie no matter how many
posts you see about it
at least now it can't make a movie try
to do that try to do just that little
short film a two minute clip
with a very clear you know message and
and see you tell your AI to make that
and watch how much you don't want to
watch it when it's done
by humans
could make the hell out of that
an a I can't do that
yeah you need a human's annotating
period because the the machine can't
tell what's working and what isn't
that's a human job
make your bed
will always be the funniest thing a mega
person could do
that in the humorous world
would look extreme
but would be silly
now I was also imagining uh what would
be extreme Mega sporting events
you know if you had like because extreme
Mega sounds like extreme sports
so as imagining suppose all the extreme
Magus had some kind of Olympics just for
extreme magnets what what events would
be there and I thought you know the the
real Olympics already has the skiing and
shooting
I have this feeling that a republican
extreme Mega events
would just be regular Sports
but also shooting
so it'd be like tennis
but you could shoot
you know you can hit the ball or you can
shoot it on the air you'd be like
basketball
but instead of playing defense you could
just shoot the ball when it's in the air
so I think you just take regular Sports
and you add shootings
you got your extreme Mega games
extreme Mega we've got basketball we're
shooting we've got soccer we're shooting
we've got curling with shooting that's
that's it
all right uh
we've got racing when shooting
we've got lawn darts well the law and
darts Standalone we that's the only one
with no shooting we've just got lawn
darts but you can fire them at each
other it's more it's not less target
practice and more
team against team
that cornhole
it's corn it's cornhole but we're
shooting
and no Bud Light
yeah maybe it's mowing your lawn and not
drinking a Bud Light
I've been mowing I'm so thirsty yeah
that would be the competition
you have to mow your lawn on a hot day
and there has to be a cold Bud uh Bud
Light sitting in front of you and you
see who can go the longest without
taking a sip of the Bud Light you have
to just keep mowing in the Sun
and you can't use sunscreen
you're just getting ready
yeah and then whoever whoever can last
the longest uh wins that competition
yeah the Mowing and resisting the Bud
Light would be a good extreme Mega
what else
uh
what would be extreme
chest boxing
chest box
all right that's more mocking
Republicans you could kind of see a
chess board and then two Republicans
wearing boxing gloves
and they they don't know the rules of
the chess game so they just punch each
other instead
that'd be pretty funny NASCAR
we shooting
all right ladies and gentlemen I think
I've done what I need to do and we've
accomplished uh everything except
getting the locals platform to work so
I'll guess I'll I'll work on that when
I'm done
yeah the wet t-shirt contest
this up is old man
uh
cornhole With Grenades
now you're talking
jousting with baguettes okay
uh
yeah Sinead O'Connor passed away I
didn't hear of what
chess boxing is a thing
is it really
the wife
all right competitive get off my lawn
get off my porch
all right I think we've done it thank
you for joining and I will see you
tomorrow
ladies and gentlemen and if you are a
member of the local Subscription Service
I will probably see you tonight
but I don't know how many are listening
here bye for now
