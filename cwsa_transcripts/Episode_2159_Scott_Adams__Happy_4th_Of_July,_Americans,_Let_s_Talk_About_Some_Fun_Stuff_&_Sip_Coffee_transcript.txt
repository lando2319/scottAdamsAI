you do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization and
maybe even American history happy Fourth
of July to all Americans and people who
like Americans I don't know why but you
do and uh maybe you'll be an American
someday too who knows could happen
but today if you would like to take your
fourth of July experience to levels that
have never been seen by anybody in the
entire world all you need is a copyright
Margaret glass a tanker chalices diet
again teen yoga flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the fourth of
July dopamine hit that you've been
waiting for it's called the simultaneous
if it happens now
ah delightful
all right um well the news is a little
bit slow a little bit slow so if we run
out of things to talk about and you
still want to do a little more I'll fire
up a spaces
so that we can take some colors and talk
about Free Will and is music a dangerous
drug
but that's only if we have time let's
talk about the news
this is a big story it doesn't seem like
a big story
but I like to get the stories early
before they grow into something big and
that that's really what I'm famous for
I'm famous for identifying things
earlier than other people identify them
and here's one I don't think anybody's
called this out yet
there was a study done on monkeys and
they gave them a natural substance
called the clotho or clotho or something
k-l-o-t-h-o
and they founded it substantially made
the monkey's cognitive abilities improve
their cognitive abilities improved
ah
I'm just gonna say
let's stop there
all right we we've improved the monkey's
cognitive ability by you know X
percentage maybe we should just call
that good
you know
you it could get out of hand
let's just say I've seen the movie
and making monkeys smarter never works
out well that never works out don't make
the monkeys smarter that's all
um did you see uh the Trump rally
there's a there's a
there's a clip of
president president Trump is mocking
Hunter Biden and Joe Biden he's saying
Joe Biden was bad at everything but he
was a he was good vice president because
he kissed Obama's ass
big Applause line big Applause line and
you know the the thing that I say about
Trump
um
there you go Herbert you're gone
thanks for being an on the 4th
of July that makes you a double
if you're an on the fourth of
July you get a double
all right
um
the thing I love about Trump and which
binds him to his audience is he says out
loud the part that you were thinking
he does that better than any politician
you're thinking it and then it just
comes out of his mouth exactly the way
you were thinking it
I always thought that Joe Biden's vice
presidency
was entirely about kissing Barack
Obama's ass that's what it looked like
it looked like he was adding nothing but
a kissing his ass
and oh we're so friends and he's my
friend and oh my friend he's my best
friend we're friends we're such good
friends
and it just looked all creepy and weird
and then Trump just calls it out it's
like he was only a good vice president
because he kissed Obama's ass and I
thought okay that's exactly what I
thought that's not that's not even
slightly not what I thought that was
exactly what I thought
anyway it's just funny when he does that
he's he's the master of that
you know I've said this before but
Trump will never get the credit he's due
for being one of the best writers of our
time
did you ever think about that I mean I'm
sure he had ghost writers for his books
and stuff I'm not talking about that I'm
talking about you know when he ad libs
when he gives a gives a response to
something when he writes a tweet
um
his just his phrasing and the the points
of I don't know the points of Leverage
he goes after are different from
everybody's there's nobody who writes
like him or talks like him nobody yeah
and you think by now that people would
because it's obviously working so if you
could imitate that you would I mean
somebody would not me but somebody would
it's just it's literally you can't
imitate it he's just operating in his
own little zone of of weird
Effectiveness that nobody even knows why
it works in some cases
but uh you know maybe someday he'll get
his due his his uh
his verbal command is just off the
charts it's just crazy
all right
um
so it looks like uh meta
once known as Facebook
uh is gonna is gonna announce its uh
Twitter
um competitor product it's going to call
it be called threads and it's going to
come out on Thursday they say maybe and
the pundits are saying it could be a big
deal now what's different about it is
that it's going to have some kind of
connection with Instagram so it can
immediately take your Instagram traffic
over to your other app
now that's a really big deal that's like
a really really big deal but here's what
I think they may have not thought
through
Twitter correct me if I'm wrong but
Twitter attracts an entirely different
kind of person than Instagram now most
people have both if you're in social
media you probably have both but don't
you use one way more than the other
the the people who have four million
followers on Instagram unless they're
also a big star in another way they know
how big Twitter
and vice versa right I mean I've got
nearly a million people on Twitter and
last I checked I think my Instagram was
fifteen thousand
something like that
now I'm not really an Instagram person
meaning that there's nothing I could do
to grow my Instagram but traffic well I
suppose I could go full Andrew Tate that
would do it but now even that wouldn't
work yeah my current age you'd still
have to have the the physicality of a
younger and good-looking guy
so I couldn't match Tate you know in the
younger good looking guy category so I
mean he's a he's sort of an ideal
Instagram personality he's got the the
the visual uh persuasion he's got that
locked down
so I
I'll go throw this consideration into
the mix I don't think those two groups
mix
and I think that if you take the
Instagram people and move them to
um
to something that looks like a Twitter
it's not going to be very interesting
it will just be people having to repost
the same thing they posted right so your
Instagram influencer isn't going to
start coming up with a political game
because they got a new new Tool they're
going to do what they're doing and then
just repost it in the other place
now that could be enough for lots of
traffic I mean that might be enough but
I don't see it competing with Twitter
for the uh political opinion stuff
it might just get a lot of traffic of
people showing naughty pictures and food
I've got a feeling that Twitter is where
the people who are going to go to a
debate and this new thing is where
they're going to go to see uh the second
time that they see that same picture
from that Instagram woman
well I saw it over on Instagram Ella
checks threads okay same picture
same picture because why wouldn't it the
the influencers are not going to do
separate content they're just going to
mirror their content in the other
platform because it's easy to do
so I don't know I don't I don't see a
dethroning Twitter in terms of influence
it might be successful
but in terms of political influence
social influence
okay we'll see but Zuckerberg's got a
good track record with this stuff so we
can assume that it's at least
competently put together
um I was listening to a bunch of smart
people scared the pants off me about
insurance companies and Banks all being
insolvent
which apparently is true
our entire insurance industry and all of
our banking they're they're all worth
nothing
at the moment
like actually worth nothing
if you were going to buy any big Bank
or any big insurance company if you
could get if you could get them to sell
it to you for one dollar
they would
if they could get rid of their debts and
sell their whole business to you for one
dollar they can't because they can't get
rid of all their debts but if they could
they would they're actually worth
nothing
the entire both Industries are worth
nothing actually nothing
they're worth less than nothing
and the credit or blame for that is
being given to the Fed
so the FED of course said I'll give you
the the idiots simple explanation you
don't need the complicated one the
simple explanation is that the Fed
sets interest rates and both insurance
companies and Banks had they must have a
number of business concerns and
Investments of their own which were at
lower interest rate returns so as soon
as the interest rate was higher than
their returns
they just can't make money it's like is
basically impossible and so the fed put
Banks and insurance companies into
non-existence in terms of their value
they still function
and I don't know exactly how this works
you know having a degree in economics
isn't helping me here at all because
we've never been here
there's nobody who can say well the last
last three times we're in this situation
we've never really been here
but I'll give you my highest level
you know assumptions
when something's this big you usually
there's plenty of energy to fix it so
the atom's law of slow moving disasters
should be enough
you know I always say that if you can
see a problem coming from far away if
you've got enough time you can do your
workarounds and your fixes and we're
very good at that we almost always
succeed if we have time
so the only thing I worry about are
things I didn't see coming such as a
pandemic right I know there were people
in the world who are preparing but
generally speaking the world wasn't
ready for that at all and I I worry so I
worry about these things I don't see
coming but this one we do see
yeah that all the smartest people are
saying it very clearly it's in the news
we see it coming so probably there's a
way to keep those things open long
enough
that interest rates adjust and their
pricing adjusts and the market adjusts
probably
who knows
all right
um
let's see uh I saw some this I didn't
have this in my notes but I just saw it
I saw somebody speculating that Romania
has already probably
gotten control of the Tate Brothers
crypto their Bitcoin
but they would not have been able to get
anything that was on a physical
um wallet you know like an actual metal
wallet
but you would think that they might even
be able to uh coerce them to give up all
their codes and passwords and stuff I
don't know so so remember when they
first got picked up do you remember my
speculation
part of my speculation was that the
entire play was just a steal their
Bitcoin and it was just a corrupt
government who was going to work them
over until they gave up their Bitcoin
and then they'd let them go or put them
in jail or something but to me it looked
like government theft
um and I don't know if it is
it's too early to say that but I'd be
really surprised if the amount of
Bitcoin that they had when they went
into prison were under custody is the
same as when they're done with this
and I don't mean because they spent it
or gave it away I just feel like the
government's trying to claw claw some of
that into their own pockets just because
it's Romania don't know pure speculation
but I'd be real surprised if they come
out of it whole
all right uh Moscow says the shot down
five Ukrainian drones
do you believe that there were five
Ukrainian drones over Moscow
do you believe that
now there was the the one reported one
reported
I don't know
I don't know about this and and they got
all five right they got all five
yeah now you you might say I wonder if
that's the Wagner group
because I told you that what should be
going on is uh decapitation efforts all
over the place
so you should assume that Putin is still
trying to kill zielinski if he can
you should assume that zelenski is going
to try to take out Putin if they can I
mean if they had a way to do it you
could assume that the Wagner group
probably has some people and some
traders who would take out Putin if they
could Putin did his first public
appearance I guess since some of the bad
news started as his first one in a while
but it was on Zoom so the first time you
see Putin after you know a number of
days since since the last time you saw
him he's on Zoom
do you think Putin's worried about his
own security
yeah
and those drones are all you need I mean
all it takes is one drone to get through
if they know where he is
and do you think that if you're Putin
it's kind of hard to move around without
people knowing where you are
don't you think there's always somebody
who knows where a Putin is
I mean you know beyond his bodyguards so
you would think that he couldn't move
anywhere without some number of people
and probably a big number of people I
mean there could be
a hundred people
yeah maybe a hundred people at least
well probably more than that I'll bet
it's the a bit of Putin moves let's say
from his Dasha to somewhere else but
there's closer to a few hundred people
who are aware of it
and you think that after all these years
we don't have one
not even one of those hundreds of people
in our pocket not one
for unlimited amount of money for that
information all they have to do is you
know they don't have to make a phone
call they just have to tell their friend
hey could you uh you know there's no
connection between us can you go drop a
phone call to the American Embassy uh
something like that now that's not the
way you do it because all their
Communications to the Embassy is I'm
sure monitored
all right
yeah yeah maybe the bodyguards wouldn't
turn but there's got to be somebody who
works in Food Services or something
if somebody maybe the motor pool people
I mean if you worked in the motor pool
for you know the the Putin Entourage you
probably know where he's going
right because you got to get the stuff
ready to go wherever it needs to go
so
I think it's a big old decapitation game
over there the everybody's trying to
take out the other leaders more so than
ever
all right well the California
reparations task force also known as the
most ridiculous organization ever
created
who uh perhaps still thinks anybody is
going to take their recommendations
they've upped their ask
uh and now they want to ask for uh
child support for black people to be
suspended
so that they you know their their child
support debts would be wiped clean just
for uh Black Americans
so they probably got done with asking
for their millions of dollars and
they're like oh shoot did anybody think
to throw in that child support thing oh
it's not too late it's not too late so
they threw that in there too
do you think that in their minds they
think some of this is going to happen
do you think that the reparations task
force has created in their minds a
little world in which some portion of
what they're going to ask for is going
to happen
I'll bet they have
because they're acting like they think
it's going to happen and they're making
sure the details are taken care of
I can't even imagine it
like in my wildest imagination I can't
imagine this happening I mean it would
be the one thing that could turn
California Republican
baby I mean I suppose anything's muzzled
all right let's talk about all the races
in the world so Soul dad O'Brien's
getting some heat on social media
uh because she didn't like the uh
the way that Asian Americans won their
victory in affirmative action so that
they were no longer discriminated
against for higher education and this is
what soul Dad O'Brien said about this
victory of fairness and equality
congrats on screwing over other people
of color ma'am
particularly those whose efforts in
civil rights paved the way for your
family to come to America
so social media is calling Soledad
O'Brien a big old racist
that would be based on the fact that
she's saying big racist stuff
so and that's pretty racist I don't know
I could see it any other way
how would you see this any other way
than racist
I can't think of any other way I'll tell
you my own soul Dad O'Brien story many
years ago I don't know 25 years ago or
something I met her when she had a
a less famous job before she broke
through she was on some local
some local TV show and I hung out with
her just like a little little bit
between
between scenes and stuff between takes I
guess whatever it is between
uh between something
and
I got a weird feeling from her
which you don't get from everybody
but I got such a weird creepy feeling
from her
and so in person she's kind of creepy I
don't know so I got I got a Vibe like I
I can't explain but it stayed with me
for decades all right let's talk about
our other racist Joy Reed
she may not have liked my robots read
news comment uh comic that featured her
but uh MSNBC decided to
retweet their article about uh me being
a big old racist provocateur
I don't know I assumed it was just some
kind of revengey holiday thing that they
were doing
but
um I love I love having MSNBC enjoy read
go after me because
I don't think anybody thinks she's not a
racist do they
she's literally the world's most famous
racist on TV when when she wouldn't you
say she's the biggest racist on
television if you're going to say of
people who are regularly on television
she would be the number one racist like
she's the one who said who's direct
about it and consistent
yeah
so I don't know I don't mind that at all
so I reprinted I republished my
robots reading news about Joy Reed
anyway this is just holiday stuff of
course when I retweeted it I had to
remind people that there's no news about
public figures that's true
I'm having I'm having a good time saying
that every time on social media somebody
comes after me for oh you said that
racist thing
all I have to do is say you know that
there's no news about public figures
that's true right or at least they leave
out context and it basically makes the
whole thing stop
because nobody wants to be so dumb that
they believe the news in 2023.
there's no Republican no Democrat who's
willing to say in public I believe the
news
think about it just think about the fact
that I could accuse people of believing
news and they'll back off immediately
and we'll just say it again because
that's so amazing
we've gotten to the point where all I do
is say you believe the news
the news
so you believe the news is giving you
the full story there
and people will just be embarrassed that
they've ever believed the news
now I'm making it more persuasive
by limiting it to about public figures
because obviously if the new says
there's a war in Ukraine well yeah
there's a war in Ukraine they might get
the details wrong but there's a war in
the UK
but when they talk about public figures
they might get you know one of the two
facts right
for example if there's a divorce they
might get that right
but they're not going to know anything
about why there was a divorce or you
know who did what or how the people feel
about each other you know whether or not
any third party was involved any of that
stuff they don't know that and they
would never know that but it won't stop
them from running the story
so yeah Joy Reed is the most ridiculous
figure in the media but I love the fact
that she's getting that she actually
made the best argument against
affirmative action anybody ever made
which is she said she would not be where
she is without it
to which I say
okay
we probably should have prevented her
from being on TV because I'm not I'm not
opposed to her because she has different
opinions than I do just to be clear I'm
not saying she has oh those left-leading
Democrat opinions I'm not even sure what
her opinions are except I mean I'm sure
they're left-leaning I have no I have no
quibble
or quarrel with or better opinions there
are tons of Americans who have different
opinions I don't dislike them in any way
but she's a ridiculous racist
she's a ridiculous racist and she's just
on TV every day like it like it's not
happening
so that's a whole different situation
anyway
favorite story of the day is that
cocaine was found in the white house so
they immediately evacuated the White
House
why would you evacuate the White House I
guess they have to figure out if it was
cocaine first maybe they thought it was
poison
but here's the best part of the story
now obviously can we just say hunter
hunter hunter you know it it's too it's
too irresistible to connect Hunter
visiting recently the White House and
also recently some cocaine was found in
the white house so I get it I get it can
we all just say can we stipulate
the hunter Biden was there
cocaine was there and that's a funny
coincidence
all right I I just I wanted to get that
established so that you don't yell
Hunter Hunter at me in the comments like
you are right now
I got it I got this i got this you don't
need to be saying hunter hunter in the
comments anymore
got it cocaine Hunter connected the dots
are connected I got it you can stop now
all right all right
um but here's the funniest part of the
story
is that as some are suggesting that
there are so many staffers on cocaine
that it could have been anybody
[Laughter]
not anybody but yeah like there's so
many people that could have been
my favorite my favorite is that it was
uh Joe Biden
because if you ever wondered how they
how they pump them up with something
just before he speaks in public
do you imagine that he's not getting a
little extra a little extra energy
right before he goes in public
you don't think that's happening
you don't think there's any kind of
little just a little extra
you don't think the doctor's there the
needle or the pill like an hour before
he speaks
I don't think there's any chance he's
going up there naturally
I don't I mean I'm sure it's legal
whatever it's doing I don't think it's
illegal but it's funny to imagine
that they had to give him cocaine every
time he talked
then and now I'm replaying all of the
Joe Biden species recently and I'm
asking myself
now you'd act if you were on cocaine
because cocaine is not anything I have
experience with
so I I don't know exactly how you act
except you know more energy and yeah
more energy more talkative
you know maybe more uh
More Alive something like that but that
seems like it'd be the perfect drug for
Joe Biden doesn't it just wake him up
enough to get some confidence give us a
little speech and stuff and then go back
to sleep
all right
well we'll never know whose cocaine it
was but it's a fun story get the cocaine
out of the White House and Trump back in
all right
um
so we heard that uh the younger Soros
who's taking over the open Society for
his dad George Soros he's going to cut
40 of his staff
but not change uh what he's doing he's
still gonna go after election integrity
and abortion or the
um or right to choose I guess he would
call it so he wants to support those
things
and he'll support liberal uh politicians
still he says but he didn't say anything
about prosecutors
is a prosecutor a politician
technically right
I mean they're elected if they're
elected their politician you don't
really think of them that way do you so
I love I I feel like
he keeps getting a pass by the media
not asked about
the you know the DA's because that's the
big thing the prosecutors
so it was a big old news story about him
that doesn't mention prosecutors
big old news story does mention that
seems like that would be the biggest
thing to mention
all right
um
I'm going to start a spaces
so if you want to hear it you could
listen to Just the audio on Spaces I'll
start it in a moment but you can watch
it right where you are so I'm gonna so
here's what the spaces will be
the title of it is Free Will and
illusion and is music a dangerous drug
talking about hip-hop in particular but
music in general
so I'm going to start it now
all right
all right ladies and gentlemen welcome
to spaces I'm doing this also on YouTube
and also on the locals platform and the
topic is is Free Will and illusion
and is music a dangerous drug the sort
of related topics but you could take
either one
now I warn you in advance that whenever
I talk about Free Will being an illusion
what normally happens is when people
argue that it exists
they argue with what I call word
thinking
now word thinking is where there's no
logic there but it's like it's like the
new AI it's just looking for word
patterns and it confuses that as
thinking
so for example if I say Free Will
doesn't exist the most common response
I'll get is well I can choose things
so it does I choose
but that's not an argument that's just
putting a different word in there
right so what you're going to watch for
is when I bring some people up to argue
that of course Free Will does exist and
by the way I only want to I only want to
talk to people who say that
Free Will does exist
if you agree with me that it doesn't
exist I'm going to cut you off
because I don't want to hear from you
like if you agree with me there's no fun
we'll just be like uh okay we agree I
got it got it right so only disagreeers
and I'm not going to be rude when I cut
you off but I'm just going to turn off
your microphone if you start agreeing
with me okay
you got the rules if you agree with me
I'm just going to turn off your
microphone and drop you all right
everybody up for that
all right let's see who looks like
they're
full of spit and vinegar is that a thing
all right how about Jacqueline
Jacqueline I'm going to add you as a
speaker so get ready to unmute yourself
all right Jacqueline unmute do you have
a comment on either of those things
[Applause]
[Music]
is made up of three
things
one being the body and of course if we
cut off part of the body such as our
hand we still exist so we are not our
body right okay
I can perceive that my my mind
thinking
on um
you know and I'll call
um that thinking mind my ego so you're
plus
do your mind do you do your mind and
your ego depend on your body or are they
they separate do they exist
so they they just float out there your
mind and your
so your mind is sort of separate from
your body
[Music]
I am something that perceives my mind
thinking and I can also perceive my body
so we're three things I am a being
that's hard to describe
I do have an ego or a mind and that my
mind thinks I have free will so my mind
will act
as it's been programmed by past
experiences and
um and you know direct my body so it
thinks it has free will does does your
does your mind survive your body's death
does your mind go on after your body is
gone
so so
since it's my being
aware and in our the present moment we
can perceive that I am that being that's
not being
um
you know driven by the ego mind that has
what things it has
wouldn't you say that the only thing you
can perceive is that you exist
everything else you don't know if it's
true or not
that's correct thank you
I've won another one all right thank you
Jacqueline you're welcome Scott
and yeah all right
all right
um who else will we take let's see I
think uh Paul looks like he's got
something to say
Paul if you
well we get people connected
Paul yes what would you like to say on
this topic
I was really a big heavy metal fan but
since I was studying Jazz a lot I forced
myself to listen to it and now uh 20
years later I gotta say I'm a very big
jazz fan also in your book uh how to
fail at everything and still win big you
talk about how you manage to program
yourself not to like snicker bars
anymore so isn't that a form of free
will
no that's just what happened
well let me let me give the example if I
were to hold an object above the ground
and let go of it
does the object have a choice of going
up or does gravity just always take it
then
well and would you think that the rules
of physics stop once they're inside your
skull or is the brain just like
everything else it can only do one thing
in one situation
so what you're saying is uh that we can
force kind of uh
we can Will ourselves to do certain
things but we gotta use uh science no no
what do you say we can Will ourselves
you're substituting words
for logic
all all
these knickers I started
jazz
yeah and watch I'm I'm holding up a a
little ball of wadded up napkins now I'm
going to let the napkins decide when I
let them go if they're going to go up or
down okay napkins decide make a decision
oh it always went the same way
you and I would have always done the
same thing we did things that's the part
we can be sure of I did a thing and you
did a thing
the reason we did the things is because
the situation that happened in our
brains was exactly the way it was
if I had added a different brain
I would have made a different decision
so it has nothing to do with the my my
sensation of decision making
because that's just an illusion I have a
sensation of decision making
so likewise where I held up the balled
up napkins and dropped them from my hand
if if the napkins had Consciousness they
would have thought oh I choose to go
down this time and then the one time it
didn't you know they they said I choose
to go up but they don't
they'd say oh some must be broken
there's something wrong with the system
or maybe I didn't really want it in
other words they would they would
rationalize why it didn't happen that
they didn't go up so Consciousness is a
rationalizer it's not something that's
giving you truth it's not it didn't it
didn't evolve to tell you it was real
it evolved to keep you from being crazy
and allowed you to reproduce which is
the only thing Evolution cared about
what
yes you know it's it's just that what
you're saying does make sense is just
like that but if we follow your logic
doesn't that mean that certain people
are just meant to be drug addicts and
certain people are just meant to be
morbidly obese yes and there's nothing
they can do about it to change it that
that that's correct but they do live in
a world in which the variables
influencing them are also changing all
the time
so one of the variables that influences
people is me
so I've got a lot of viewers who used to
enjoy drinking more than they drink now
and when I said alcohol is poison it
programmed a number of them they tell me
anyway that they almost immediately stop
drinking and they're they're happy that
they did now those are people who went
from drinkers to non-drinkers without
any free will whatsoever there was just
an outside force that was good news for
them
all right thanks thanks a lot Scott all
right thanks Paul take care bye
all right
all right let's see who else looks like
they would
oh you know I'm so influenced by the
names that people choose on Twitter
and I have to pick Lord Pepsi
so Lord Pepsi
with that name
you were added Lord Pepsi
um as soon as you unmute your your
microphone we'll be hearing your
question
Lord Pepsi speak to us
Lord are you not ready
now this is why I I used to drink diet
coke because Lord Lord Pepsi hey yes
what would you like to say I'm good what
would you like to say
these drug centers that were people
could be like as a commune I was at one
of those in Mexico
um I could talk to you a bit about it
oh did it work
yes I've been clean for 20 years um I
came to the realization that my life
could just change I could basically
become a homeless
or fix it and change it it was like one
of those hardcore decisions like almost
like an epiphany where well I could
become this person asking for change at
the coming off the freeway side of the
road or
I could just go clean how do I go clean
and basically yes we're just all working
with each other
make building the place and our
resources came from like basically
Outreach hey we're gonna
go out and ask for support very
basically right I'm just I mean there's
details involved but and we get building
materials and build up a kitchen and
build up a dormitory and the office and
over the years it developed into what it
is now as any commune would function and
we'd have AAA meetings there
um morning midday and then night
um rice and beans and some kind of a
soup uh was like our main meal
um nothing fancy so it was like hardcore
Farm style living
with a bunch of druggies living with
each other
and we're kind of sort of voluntarily
there because we knew we were we had
messed up lives can you hear me well
yeah yeah keep going people are
fascinated yeah
okay so um
yeah I listened a lot more so I'm
thinking I'm trying to speak with my
thinking thoughts like try to convey
them well um Okay so
uh my parents definitely went out I was
like 13. I got into drugs like I lived
in the hood I guess you could say like I
was just exposed at a young age to drugs
and alcohol and got too deep into it too
quickly and I feel fortunate that
because of that I was still at a right
at the young enough age to to end it or
stop drugs early enough in my life to
not
develop my life around drugs so to speak
so tell us more about the facility
though so there was a place you went to
Mexico with just addicts and you
basically built a commune and that that
experience of just not having any drugs
around and having something to do that
you all joined in on that that you think
that was enough to keep you off drugs
when you when you live with druggies
they know what they're they're about
like they know their lives are messed up
for lack of a harsher word you know I'm
being very kind about that you know like
there's no BS it's some of it's mental
illness and regardless like
when you're living the such a way it's
like
um
you can't lie to yourself and say am I
gonna be doing living a low life you
know some people they conform like
they're satisfied with that and there's
some
problem in their mind saying well
wouldn't you like to go better relax no
I'm hopeless because whatever like so
some people make this some people decide
to get clean and say you know what I do
actually want a better life but how do I
do this yeah I know what do you think of
the suggestions that uh Trump made and
uh also RFK Jr made separately about
creating I guess a using government land
and creating basically a city or a
campground or something where the
addicts can go and just be away from the
rest of the people and try to get
healthy
hey
they offer you because it's an acronym
okay
c-r-r-e-a-g c-r-r-e-a-d
yes okay and it's all sensor recovery
Rehabilitation for amphetamos which is
sick people that are sick and pedibles
okay uh
alcoholism and drug addiction all right
great hey Lord Pepsi thanks for the call
and uh big congratulations from the
entire audience and for me for your
success when people get off drugs and
they stay off drugs for 20 years I swear
there's nothing that impresses me more
that's like the ultimate
um personal accomplishment so good job
for you and thanks for thanks for
calling
all right
right thank you thank you
well that was interesting didn't expect
that all right let's see um
ill was it I'll fight you naked you
racist that's the name of the account
all right
uh I'll fight you naked
as soon as you unmute your microphone
you can ask your questions
come on
I hear you
music is in fact a dangerous
drug speak up please music Is A
Dangerous Drug you agree
yes I agree
all right he says uh
I think Peterson is the woman who told
us
um
he believes it speaks to a part of the
human being that it's capable of sin
yeah we're having a little audio problem
so I'm gonna I'm gonna do things I'm
going to have to drop you off because
um but I I think I got the point uh
Jordan Peterson also said that music
touches sort of a non-rational part of
the brain which it does
all right let's see uh
uh news for what
news for friends let's try you
know news for friends
unmute your speaker your microphone and
uh ask your question please
oh I see on the speakers so you must be
talking to me I am
thank you for letting me speak my main
thing is to thank you for everything
you've had the nerve to come out and say
too many people are afraid to say the
uncomfortable things
and I think it's very important to be
able to do so that in itself is a lesson
that more people need to follow more
people need to emulate that behavior
well thank you did
you ever did you have a question or
comment on the topic Free Will Solutions
yes
because most people are listening to
music that's not tuned properly
um the the way you listen to it makes a
big difference and I saw it with my with
friends of my kids when they were
growing up
and especially during that rap era and
watching the behavior of the young
teenagers while listening to this music
it was very distracting it had them
focus on the wrong things
and I made a point in my home to pipe in
music I was fortunate to have a nice
speaker system that went throughout the
home and I calmed them down at night
with very nice music a lot of and got a
lot of harp and violin anyway
um all right yeah well it sounds like
you're agree with me I when I started
this I said I wouldn't let anybody on
who agreed with me you may have missed
that because I said that the front so
I'm going to look for somebody who
disagrees with me but thanks for calling
okay all right bye-bye
yeah I announced at the beginning I only
wanted to disagreeers because it's just
more fun
so let's see if I can find a disagreeer
all right I'm going to go with somebody
named Chris rat
I don't know if that's his real last
name or he just likes calling himself a
rap
uh Chris rat are you there
because I'm a foreigner
is it it's your actual name all right
I'm sure you don't get I'm sure you
don't get any trouble for with that last
name at all Dad do you have
did you ever comment on the topic
is that music and
um I think it just made me even more sad
and probably not very fun to be around
yeah I don't see how that could not be
the case if you're sad and you listen to
sad music how's that going to help you
like it doesn't make sense did did you
disagree with me I'm only looking for
the disagreeers today
all right
all right thanks thanks for joining and
uh thank you all right bye-bye
all right
this will remove you
well it's hard to get anybody who
disagrees
so how about uh Zara
Zara you look you look like you've
you've been to the gym all right Zara
hey how's it going do you just great I'm
gonna disagree with you I'm gonna
disagree with you a ton but I can't
possibly do that without doing The Rush
Limbaugh Dido thing first so I want to
thank you for being awesome and one of
the greatest people on the planet and
for paying whatever price is necessary
to try to make the world a better place
I really appreciate all the stuff that
you do well thank you let's get to the
disagreeing the audience is like
disagree damn it disagree do it let's do
it okay there is such a thing as free
will and I can't give you a knockdown
argument for it because if I did you
wouldn't be free to believe in
determinism anymore and I I think we're
free to do that so
here's what I want to suggest
the scientific language is really good
for a number of things but it has to
objectify the world in order to do those
things Fair
okay so that means it can get you to the
moon and build an iPad which mythopoetic
thinking and philosophical thinking and
metaphysical thinking we'll never be
able to do
the only way you can do those sorts of
things is by first banishing all
consideration of things that are
subjective which means there's certain
questions
that it doesn't really it's not really
appropriate to use that language to
discuss those questions for instance
look
pinch your arm and you feel a message
and the message isn't hey something
negative for your reproductive ability
is happening at your left arm so pull it
away
the message is hey you're in pain right
now and that pain feels like something
but science has nothing to say about why
it feels like something to feel pain
or why it's like something to say red
all subjective quality of life is
something the science can't say anything
about
it doesn't mean that we don't have
evidence that it's real it's as real to
each one of us as anything else could
possibly be it's just that the proper
language for discussing those sorts of
things are music and poetry and
philosophy and just different
vocabularies
so what happens is I'll be short and
wrap it up but the the gist of the point
is what science does in order to be
powerful is it banishes all
consideration of subjective things and
then sometimes scientismists turn around
at the end of that and they say oh my
goodness I found nothing subjective
there's no such thing as Consciousness
or free will or what it's like to be
something wait a minute wait a minute
wait a minute did you define
consciousness and Free Will as a
subjective experiences so it are you
saying this just something that you feel
and the feeling is real or that it's
real in the real world
what's real is it I'm saying
the objectivist scientific approach well
no no I'm not I'm not talking about
anything pejorative I'm just trying to
understand
just as real as objective things unless
you're a scientist in which case you're
not allowed to think that no it's
subjective to you so it's real to the
one person but it's not real to the
other people
right so so like the problem of other
Minds is a philosophical problem you're
not going to settle it scientifically
right uh is that what you're getting it
well certainly uh if your reality is a
subjective reality and your subjective
reality includes your subjective feeling
about free will
then I would think of that more like a
um that's more like a fiction which you
created to live in
which okay which you might enjoy it but
it but it wouldn't have anything to do
with free will it would be just you
deciding that you wanted to ignore the
the external world for the subjective
world
I see why I see why you think that I'm
uh here's an argument though I'm going
to suggest that the objectification of
the world is itself a fiction that we've
known as the fiction for Millennia the
idea that there's little bits of hard
stuff out there that I can make
measurements on and make predictions
about what they're going to do next is
is something that even our scientific
experiments are now showing us is not a
sustainable way of conceptualizing the
world around us
there's other ways of thinking about who
we are in relation to the cosmos and
culture and nature and the Divine and
all those other things that that don't
use the objectivist fiction to start out
and they have an ability to make
progress in areas that science can't
make progress even though science can
make a kind of progress that they could
never dream of making are you doing
adopting this fiction you're doing
better than I was expecting all right so
let's see if this is compatible with you
thinking this is different but it might
be compatible if we are a simulation
meaning that we're just software and
bits who imagine that we're real and
imagine the objective World which I do
believe by the way which is a version of
what you're saying the the subjective
world so I call it a simulation
but but calling it a subjective world
isn't too far off I mean they seem to
overlap a lot so if so so I've been
wanting to tell you that forever because
I've loved your simulation thing as soon
as you brought it up and I recognized it
as well similar to a lot of other
metaphysical uh conceptions of the
universe including the Hindu and some
other perspective so anyway I'm going to
shut up and let you finish but well if
we're if we're a simulation or indeed
some kind of subjective world then the
rules of physics are also an illusion
so when I say that as long as you
believe in the rules of physics the
rules of physics work the same outside
of your skull as inside your skull just
stuff's going to happen the way it's
going to happen there's nothing you can
do about it but if our entire world this
objective world of skulls and things
that are inside and out and even even
physics if that's all imaginary
then all bets are off
so so I'm not an anti-realist I mean I I
understand that you can be an
anti-realist in looking at it that way
but here's another way of approaching it
which is to say that the objectivist
fiction and the subjectivist
descriptions like the mythopoetic or
some a priori philosophical approaches
are like two rails that the train rests
on right so it doesn't have to become an
anti-realist thing where you deny that
there's a world around you just because
it's like something to be you and that
world is in relationship with you and
you're in relationship with it
the fact that it's subjective doesn't
mean it's just arbitrary or chaos or
oral illusion
um so I think we're kind of of one mind
when we I think when we say that the
same thing is true of the scientific
conceptions of the universe but
maybe it's an attitudinal difference
where I feel like you can Embrace that
and just say that's what it's like to be
and it's exciting and and there's truth
in and meaning in all of that well I
think what you're going for is there
might be more than one reality or at
least
um our little brains might only be able
to see one but there could be others
and under that framing I have no
argument because it imagines the
unimaginable
so in an unimaginable world free will
can exist because I can't imagine
anything in that world so actually good
job good job sir no I'm gonna shut up
now but I will just say that that isn't
isn't what I think I was trying to get
at but that's okay um this is awesome
and keep being awesome and I'll talk to
you later oh yes I I didn't mean to that
that would characterize your review that
was more my summary of myself but thank
you
all right well that was interesting that
was more
that was a little deeper than I thought
it would get
all right ladies and gentlemen how about
one more one more
let's go with Matt oh I was talking to
him on Twitter so this will be good
Matt
you will be on as soon as you unmute
your microphone hey Matt
I can't hear you Madison there you are
thank you thanks for having me on it's a
pleasure to listen to you live my work
schedule usually makes it so you're my
workout entertainment but today I get to
say something good comment um so I
believe that people do have free will
and and I really don't think it's that
complicated a concept
because without Free Will I think humans
would devolve into complete uh chaos you
have an internal internal sense about
you about what's right and wrong and to
say there's no free will would be simply
to say that a drug addict chooses to be
on drugs which is of course true once
they're addicted but the original
decision had consequences of taking
drugs it's also to say that a pedophile
can't help themselves and therefore we
should excuse them so I think a
fundamental Concept in human nature is
that we do have free will particularly
free will to make subjective or moral
choices oh yeah well hold on but but
you're I think your argument is we do
like there's no argument there you're
just saying it exists
I don't think it's an illusion I I think
it's an actual part of human existence
all right
so Matt
do you think that the rules of physics
stop inside your skull
no of course huh so do you believe that
if you if you could magically know
everything about a brain's condition you
know we can't but if you can know
everything about its situation would you
be able to predict the next thing you
did with 100 accuracy
we're ever going to know that no no no
no no I'm not saying that we could do it
I'm asking you how much you believe in
in the let's say the reach of physics
does physics reach into your brain
chemistry down to the electrical signals
and therefore with your specific
experience and your specific you know
how much you ate that day and how your
brain is feeling in this exact structure
that day wouldn't you agree that the
next decision is is guaranteed to be
only one thing
no I don't think so because I think you
live in an environment and conditions
change like one day you think something
is good the next day you don't I no hold
on hold on Matt Matt you're just
describing the the physical conditions
changed so one day is different from the
other because your brain is different
the next day so that's agreed with me so
the fact that you would make a different
decision in the morning than you would
in the afternoon
doesn't say anything about free will
because you're a different person in the
afternoon well the Third
search transcends the physics maybe it's
a spiritual component that isn't about
physics do you believe do you believe
hold on do you believe that you have a
um something with a mind that survives
your body
truthfully I don't know
um I don't know
so I'm trying to find the the mechanism
that would give you free will if it's
not coming from the physical world and
it can't because physics is physics
inside your skull right if it's coming
from someone else wouldn't it be imposed
upon you let's say it came from God
let's say God said all right I'm going
to nudge you toward this decision that's
God's decision
not yours
I swear you have the ability to make
these decisions for right or wrong no no
hold on hold on hold on Matt you're
you're substituting instead of logic
you're just saying things are that that
doesn't work the the God didn't change
your physics in that case he just gave
you some more information
I'm supposing
I'm going against
Einstein came along and there's
something different and so I'm supposing
that there could be something different
controlling it because it's inherent
well hold on hold on hold on hold on I'm
not disagreeing with the fact that there
could be something controlling us
outside of our outside of our domain I'm
saying that if it did that would not be
an argument for free will it would just
be something else is moving you that you
didn't know about no no I'm not saying
controlling I'm just saying something
that exists that allows you to make
these decisions that we can't well who's
you but who's you well I'm my body I I
don't have any other part of me that's
floating around somewhere do you do you
have is there a part of you that's
floating around you know we can talk
about a soul and we can talk about your
spirit and so on you know whether
they're real or not obviously
a slit I I do believe that somewhere in
there there's a sense of what happens
that isn't related to physics it isn't
related to that and you can choose to go
one way you can just choose to go one
way or another and it's totally hold
that hold on you just substituted to
choose
for for a reason you just put a word in
there that I call that word thinking so
word thinking is when you just say I do
have free will because I can choose all
you did is just substitute a new word
but you you have to argue against the
the only arguments that work are the
physics don't apply to your brain or
that there's some non-physical thing
that we don't understand that is also
you so that you exist both as a body
but also as some other entity that's
also you that can control your body
that that those are the only two choices
I can see
yeah right so right so it's more I don't
know if it's exactly the right
description but it's more the latter but
you but that that ladder also is in your
this is in your decision making it's in
your your chooses so let's say let's say
if science got to the point and we know
it can't but let's say it could watch
your brain so carefully and so
completely that it can predict what the
next thing is that will happen
if science could predict the next thing
that happened every time just by looking
at your brain would you say that that
rules out that there's some external
Source that's also influencing it if you
absolutely if
so if there's a addiction if there's a
prediction model then they're definitely
not free will or you know it's it's
chosen for you I think the point that it
could be anything you want is what makes
it what makes it free will okay so yes
your answer in your in your theory of
course if if science could come up with
a method or you could monitor it and
sort of know what would happen with 100
certainty then I agree there's no such
thing I don't think that's ever possible
well it's not possible to do the actual
science of it but certainly it is more
of a mental experiment yeah so so I
think that where we could agree Let's
find let's find our agreement Point our
agreement point is that if Free Will
exists it's it's probably external or
something mysterious to the body but it
would have to be essentially you because
otherwise it would be an external Force
affecting you
right
I couldn't agree more I think it's
perfectly said all right so that that
that allows that um in a world we can't
completely understand it could sort of
exist in some unknown domain
I think that's uh that spirituality or
religion or you know it's sort of it's
sort of implicit in there so yeah yeah
all right thanks Matt appreciate it
thanks for having me I see you in the
see you on Twitter yes yeah
I I love I love talking to the people
that I've talked to on Twitter
yeah just gives them that the full
personality thing
all right
um shaylock says and this is the
interesting point if there's no free
will then no man can be held responsible
for their actions what do you think of
that
if Free Will is it an illusion let's say
everybody agreed a solution that people
cannot be held
do you know why that's ridiculous
because the people who are holding them
responsible have no free will
they're going to do it
they don't have a choice of course
they're going to do it and the reason
they're going to do it is because you
don't have free will
what you do have is the ability to weigh
costs and benefits and to do the thing
which you think is the best thing for
you so if they increase the cost
of doing something like stealing
it does change your likelihood of doing
it so your lack of Free Will is why you
have to be punished do you understand
that
you have to be punished
because you don't have free will
does that make sense
because without the punishment you would
choose the wrong things it's the
punishment that makes you choose
correctly it's not you
it's not you I'm making you choose I'm
putting a gun to your head and saying
don't do it
don't do it you're like but I want to do
it don't do it
so no if you don't have free will you
have to have laws
it's the only thing that makes people
act in a way where we can all survive
um
so everybody who's using the word
choosing or Choice you're not part of
the logical argument
right because I see people trying to
weasel this always happens to this
conversation people try to word things
their way around I just saw that in
locals well maybe there's something
external but once it reaches your brain
you still get to choose
that's not an argument you just you just
said that Free Will exists because
Choice exists in other words you just
gave it a different name and then
declared victory
all right uh let me let me prove to you
let me prove to you that my telephone is
really a cantaloupe you're a cantaloupe
done
if you don't think my phone is a
cantaloupe I just argue that it is it's
a cantaloupe
do you like my argument
that's the same argument I just saw
somebody says like I have free will
because I can choose my phone is a
cantaloupe because it's a cantaloupe
same thing
all right spaces thanks for joining I'm
going to end the spaces and I appreciate
it
I forgot the spaces was still on I was I
was just talking away like like it
wasn't on
life changed when you realize there's no
free will
you have no choice how to define it
emergent is the key
so you think choice is an emergent
property
I don't know
that's a that's a stretch
Randomness is the key no Randomness
simply exists it's not the key to
anything
online philosophy lectures
Free Will is an emergence of biology
no the illusion of Free Will is emergent
from biology the illusion of free will
all right
how about assigned opinions assigned
opinions are just mechanical
um Free Will is a is a contested term
yeah I guess this
so to me the only way that Free Will can
exists is if we're a simulation
and that we steer the simulation by
authoring it but it isn't so much our
own choices we're we're changing all
right here here's how you can have free
will let me give you a version of free
will that I would believe in
um I can program myself to make
different decisions in the future
I can program myself now
to make different decisions in the
future for example
I can use my lack of free will now all
right so let's say I don't have free
will but I can use my lack of Free Will
which is driving me to avoid listening
to negative movies and music
right
so I'll use my lacquer free will to make
sure that I don't expose myself to
negative media
now project myself into the future
will my decision be the same as if I had
not done this now
probably not I would make different
decisions in the future if I have
exposed myself to those things so
basically I'm using my non-free will now
because it's just I'm just doing what
I'm doing
but it is creating a situation where my
future decisions will be different than
they would have been today or under a
different situation so that's that's
sort of like a minor version of free
will I can set myself up to make a
different decision in the future
without having the choice about it at
the moment
I mean it's not really free will but it
sort of ish
all right
that's Choice yeah you're right that's
choice
but it's not free will
yes uh if
if the Big Bang
um
created a chain of cause and effect that
was determined by the physics of the
time
then nobody had any free will and
everything from the first moment of
creation determined everything else
exactly with no deviation
if physics is real
yeah and there's nothing else
influencing it
all right
that's all I got for today it's a weird
kind of holiday day I don't know if
anybody else is working
am I the only one working today
is anybody else working today
anybody oh we got some workers all right
all right
then I don't feel alone
I I I work every day
uh even on vacation you know I'll just
get up earlier and work and
I don't know if anybody has this does
anybody else have this feeling that if
you take time off it's really really
hard to work again
if you have that experience
like I almost never take time off unless
it's forced you know like I'm in the
hospital or something
um
but yeah if I take two days off from
writing a comic I feel like I don't know
how to do it anymore
so it's actually it sort of it sort of
helps my mental state to always do a
little work every day then I feel like
I'm in the game
now I'm gonna I'm gonna make a claim
that I think it's too early to know but
you can observe this over time
I believe that not retiring is making me
smarter
because every day I work I wake up I'm
66 now and at 66 I wake up and I make
insanely complicated decisions every day
like really complicated decisions about
a lot of stuff every day and
I don't know how that could be anything
but good for my brain
and I was reading an article about how
people who have accomplished things that
you tend to do things at age 25.
you know people seem to be pretty good
at age 25 chess players max out of 35
but there's there's recognition that
some people pick up skills as they go
and in some cases they could be more
effective as they get older how old is
Jordan Peterson
yet
he's 60 right
is Jordan Peterson doing his best work
I would say yes I would say he's doing
his best work and that he's I don't even
know if he's baked he may not have
peaked
because you know his life is studying
all kinds of stuff
until you get to this age where all the
stuff starts coming together into one
coherent point of view and then he
shares it with us and we say oh my God
it looks like you've been thinking about
that for 61 years
and he was and so he helps you out now I
feel like my
um positive impact
is the greatest now that it's ever been
now Dilbert was its own thing and
probably I couldn't create a Dilbert you
know from scratch if I started today it
had to be the right time in the right
place and all that other stuff
but
I don't feel that my Effectiveness is
less than it was when I was 25. I feel
like I'm at my highest Effectiveness
right now
yeah George Carlin was still killing it
into his 60s a lot a lot of examples of
that
JK Rowling I don't know how old was she
when she was writing her best doing her
best work 40s
well Charlie Munger yeah Charlie Munger
is 99.
and he still makes sense doesn't he
Charlie Munger is not retired is he
he's 99.
yeah he's not retired
have you ever heard Charlie Munger talk
does he sound like a 99 year old
well a little bit but
you can you can tell that the brain is
still there
still working fine
yeah maybe a little degradation but
still working fine Thomas Sowell how old
is Thomas Sowell
I keep thinking he passed away but he's
still around right he's 9-1 you just
don't see him because of his age I guess
all right well that's all I got to say
today so happy Fourth of July everybody
and I'll see you later YouTubers
