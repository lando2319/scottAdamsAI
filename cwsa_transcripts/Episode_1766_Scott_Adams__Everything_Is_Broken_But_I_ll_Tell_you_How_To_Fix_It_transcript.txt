good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
coffee with scott adams it never gets
worse it only gets better every single
day
in fact you could probably feel the
tingle
can you yeah
starting to quiver a little bit starting
to feel better and every moment that you
are signed on to this
you're going to feel a little bit better
and all you need to take it up
to an unbelievable level
is a copper mugger glass up tanker
chelsea steiner canteen joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
oh so good
so so good
all right
well politico has an article that says
that
president joe biden is exasperated
that
his poll numbers are worse than donald
trump's
could you imagine
doing this one last mission as a
politician you're you're joe biden
it's several years ago and you say you
know
only i can save the country from this
orange menace
and that he dedicates the the closing
years of his life you know the the few
that are left for him to enjoy his
grandkids or whatever
and he puts all of his energy into it
and when he gets there
finally he saved the world from donald
trump
and then the poll numbers say
you know we we kind of prefer trump
actually
compared to you
compared to you
i i'm not saying
anything bad about you i'm just saying
we slightly compared the you know we
preferred him just slightly preferred
him
can you imagine the failure that that
would feel like
you tried to save the world and then
when you were done and you thought you'd
really
accomplish something
the world says you know
turns out we didn't need to be saved at
least not by you
so uh
biden's solution to this is rather than
make good decisions and and lead the
country in a productive way what he
really needs to do is travel more
that's his solution he's going to travel
more
so they can highlight his
administration's uh
wonderful accomplishments
now
what do you think of that do you think
the real problem is
that the news
has not been giving him a fair
shake
what
no i don't think that's the problem
could you imagine if the news treated
biden the way they treated trump
well
just imagine what the
polls would look like
if biden had one week
of what trump put up with every day
it would be insanely funny i mean
biden's approval record would be
basically zero
well on the good news
new york times had two stories about
cancer cures
different kinds of cancers but there are
small studies that would need to be
reproduced but in one of them
everybody in the trial got better
what
it was a small trial but basically just
everybody got better
i mean you know
that's pretty impressive i've never even
heard of that have you ever heard of
that
where it's it's i think it was maybe 18
people or something it was pretty small
but every one of them just got cured
i've never heard of that
i mean that's
certainly encouraging i don't want to
get too happy about it too soon but
that's pretty encouraging
and then there's so there's something
with pancreatic
cancer somebody got cured of pancreatic
cancer
that's the first time ever isn't it
am i wrong about that
i always thought pancreatic was the one
that you can't do anything about
yeah these are specific cancers i'm not
talking about
cancer as a category
right these are very specific there was
an anal one and a pancreatic one rectal
one i guess
it came back it will come back somebody
says maybe could be anyway i like to
think that maybe some of this is true
so i've been having fun with my democrat
hoax list
it's a list of top 10 hoaxes
i put it in the form of a quiz
and
have you noticed how handy it is if you
follow me on twitter
that you just you just whip out the top
10 list of hoaxes and just paste it for
your troll and your troll will just
start going crazy
because it's a crazy maker if you're if
you're on the left there are too many
things on the list to deal with
and you could tell that at least some of
them get they've got you
probably i assume
and then and then other people will you
know pour in to say if you believe this
list
it actually it's pretty handy
now
i'm going to challenge your independent
thought
are you ready for this
are you ready for this
you
are the smartest audience in all of
politics
that actually might be true by the way
let me say that again because it's sort
of a shocking thing to say
but i think it might actually literally
be true
that this is the smartest audience in
politics
i think so because it's the only
audience who gets
a continuous dose of well let's look at
this the smart way
nobody else does that i don't do they
i mean nobody else is even trying to do
it as far as i know
but there is one really big glaring
thing that i haven't been able to do
because i don't think i can get away
with it with my own with my own audience
i don't think i could get away with it
and that would be a top 10 hoax list
that people on the right believe
i can't do that yet can i
you know i can't
because i would lose i would lose my
audience
so what you're gonna have to do
is you're gonna have to do that for me
so i want you to you can you can do it
here
but you can also do it on twitter
tell me what you think are the top 10
hoaxes
that people on the right believe
that make a difference
uranium one would be on my list yes
but that's kind of old news i think i'd
keep it
keep it to
pizzagate i don't know that anybody
believes that now do they
pizzagate was a temporary one
that people did believe
that's sort of part of q i think
maybe that's a subset of q
uh
somebody says the drinking bleach hoax
is almost true
is
it so in fact
yeah so if i if i were to say okay you
got this wrong because the science says
this
but you believe this i can't get away
with that
because the people on the right don't
believe science
should they
probably not
probably not it's not it's not
irrational to not believe science
anymore they used to be
but not anymore it's pretty obvious that
a lot of the science is fake
we just don't know which is fake and
what's real
so
so how would you come up with a
republican list
because the republican list i think
would have more
disagree with science stuff on it
but that doesn't mean you're wrong
does it
disagreeing with science doesn't mean
you're wrong anymore
you used to
sort of usually
yeah i don't know if i could do it it's
sort of a they're not really apples and
oranges but if you can do it it would be
really helpful make me a list of
republican hoaxes that republicans
believe
all right
and by the way if you can't do that
if you can't do that
ask yourself why
it's probably a problem with with you
it's probably not because there aren't
any hoaxes it's probably a problem with
you now i'm telling you
straight up i can't make that list
because if i did then i would lose my
ability to have an audience and then you
know the cost would be higher than the
benefit
but you can so make me a list of boxes
we'll see what we can do then
all right
uh well here's some fake news
i think
so on fox news reporting that the
cdc met with representatives of the
teachers union several times as they
were trying to decide what the cdc
policy on masks would be
now the implication is
that the cdc got their
so-called science from the teachers
unions
instead of science itself
so that that's the nature of the story
it doesn't say it as directly as i just
said it
but the way it's presented
is sort of as a question you know
hey were they were they using the
tissues unions and ignoring
science
to which i say fake news fake news
now i think i can call fake news on this
better than other people
because i'm literally the number one
critic of teachers unions in the united
states
literally nobody has a harder line
against the teachers unions
than i do and a lot of people don't like
them but nobody has a hardest line as i
do because i say they're the source of
systemic racism
in addition to the source of other
badness
so i ate the teachers unions for reasons
that
the right would like
but also reasons that
that the left should like
the left should like to have better
schools for
people of color
better schools for low-income people
better schools for black americans
the left should like all that that's
what i want and i think the teachers
unions are the
obstacle to that
so nobody hates the teachers unions more
than i do but
can we grow up a little bit
let's grow up a little bit
you're the head of the cdc and you're
going to make a decision about
schools and masks
you think you're not going to talk to
the teachers union several times
they're the main stakeholders
or you know
there are some of them
of course you are
you should talk to them a lot
now that doesn't mean that you take
their you take their advice over
science
but there's no there's no evidence of
that there's no evidence that the cdc
listened at least in the story
there's no evidence that the cdc
listened to the teachers unions
listened to science
decided that they were not the same and
then decided to side with the teachers
unions
that didn't really happen
or let me say
it's not presented in any kind of
evidence that was suggested
the only thing this story tells us is
that the cdc did exactly what you'd want
them to do
they talked to the stakeholders
multiple times
that's an a plus
that's a plus
that's that's get pull you get promoted
for that
you don't get criticized for that
i'm seeing uh tons of push back here
nope nope nope
all right stop saying nope
you have to add something besides nope
that's nothing right don't make me get
on you you know i don't like this
you know i don't like it when you just
say no because you have room for a
reason
tell me tell me what your reason is
all right or or just don't comment
all right
so if i if i were going to rate this one
i would rate it fake news
how comfortable would you be with that
and by the way keep in mind
i i think probably the cdc did take too
much guidance from the teachers unions
probably
but there's not evidence of it
right i can have a suspicion
but this story it just feeds my
suspicion it doesn't tell me whether it
happened or not
and i'm not sure that
it's hard for me to believe that the
head of the cdc
would literally ignore science
for what the teachers unions wanted i
actually just don't believe that's true
i think they may have convinced
themselves the science was different
than what you think
they may have had other political
considerations sure
but i don't think they just went to the
teachers unions and said hey randy
weingarten tell me what to do with
science
i don't think that happened that feels
like fake news
well speaking of fake news the new ceo
of cnn
has announced or at least we know
somehow
that uh he wants the network to have
more nuance and less hype
more nuance and less hype
because if i were to look at the
problems with cnn over the last several
years
what i'd say is
hey
you seem to have insufficient nuance
and too much hype
no i would not say that
do you know what the problem with cnn
has been over the last few years
literally making up news
how about
less of that
i'm not really sure that nuance and hype
are exactly the target zones here
how about
don't make up stories that are just made
up
how about stop saying that the president
said you should drink bleach
that's a made-up story
that's that's not nuance
there's no nuance there
it's not hype that's just made up
so
cnn's i'm trying to be more serious but
the only thing that's going to do is
reduce their profits
um
how many people do you think use twitter
as a percentage of americans
all right
let's say just america i don't know how
it shakes out for the rest of the world
but how many americans do you think use
twitter
just give me a guess
you know so i'm seeing 15 percent
et cetera
interestingly because your guesses are
very close to what
you
you specifically
uh watch
so among republicans it's around 17
so those of you who are guessing 15
for the people you know
pretty close pretty good guess that's
good guessing by the way if you didn't
know the answer and you guessed 15
and you're a republican that was a
pretty good guess
pretty good guess
it's around 23 percent for america in
general because there are way more
democrat leading
into
and independence
so between the democrats and the
democrat leaning independence the 32
percent of them are using
so so basically twice as many democrats
as republicans using twitter
i think we found the problem
this might be the whole problem
it might be
just game this out
in my opinion twitter is the tale that
wags the dog
in other words the mainstream media
they could they could do something
different than what's happening on
twitter but not for long
because twitter basically forms the
opinion of the public
there's usually two there's a left
opinion and a right opinion but that
sort of gets formed on social media
which is primarily twitter because
that's where the
media people hang out
and that once
once the truth is defined on twitter
the regular media outlets over time will
start to conform to it now on day one of
a story it's a two-way thing
on day one of a new story the news might
be breaking it on tv and twitter's
reacting and then the reactions are
getting back on tv and then that
reaction becomes the story and then
twitter reacts so that so the beginning
is all this back and forth
but stories eventually settle into a
narrative
and i think the narrative is created on
twitter
and then the the rest of the country
sees how it tested
because twitter is like this big testing
site
where every tweet gets tested
ooh if i said it this way how many
retweets do i get
but if i worded it this way
so twitter's is massive a b testing for
narratives
and once a narrative is settled you know
enough new information is coming in or
stopped and the fog of war is
calming down a little bit
twitter decides what we think
and there are twice as many democrats as
republicans using it
in theory
this explains everything you see
the number of people who use twitter
is twice as many people leaning in one
direction
which in theory
should cause the stronger narrative to
be wherever they they're leaning
and that that should bleed over into the
mainstream media
and that the truth
would be ignored in that process
because when twitter is testing a
narrative you know what works on the
right or works on the left
when it's testing those narratives you
know what it's not doing
fact checking
it's not fact checking
it's just looking for what is most
popular
and the one that's most popular
typically is the one with the least
factual basis
because what makes something so sticky
and exciting and causes your head to
explode
is that it doesn't make sense
those are the ones that get you going
like my god did they really do that how
dumb could they be to have done that
right the outrageous stuff that isn't
even real
didn't really even happen
those are the things that get us excited
so because there are twice as many
democrats as
republicans
on twitter
everything else is explained by that
isn't it
because
i i feel like if the numbers were at
least similar
then the competing narratives would you
know get more challenge from the other
side
and right now the people on the left
don't even see the arguments on the
right
have any of you used my hoax quiz my top
10 hoaxes
has anybody used it and to see what kind
of reaction you get
it's quite a reaction isn't it
i'm hearing from people who have
and i just saw somebody saying it ruined
somebody's day yesterday
but when you see the reaction it's
really the flailing and the desperation
when they see the list
because it is a moment when you realize
that you've been fooled
on some level you realize it and then
your your brain has to like unrealize it
to keep yourself sane
so you can't really just say oh man i
really got fooled for five years in a
row
so you don't do that like brains don't
do that oh i guess i've been wrong for
five years i guess i'll just admit
everything i thought was wrong
nope
instead you will redefine it until
you're right again right your brain will
just make you right
all right
but anyway twitter is wagging the dog
and now everything has been explained
and maybe elon musk can really make a
difference
it wouldn't take much in terms of
tweaking how twitter works
to make a difference
so this is not a joke
this is like a real thing that's
happening in my head
when i see people who have been duped by
cnn and msnbc
and the rest
i no longer think of them as news
consumers or
people who disagree with me
or people on the opposite side of you
know some political issue
i used to
i used to think we were talking about
the issue
but now it's so obvious that they're
just victims
and i'm starting to feel this empathy
like i'll see them flailing around
thinking that
that the president once called neo-nazis
fine people
they actually believed that happened in
the real world that that actually
happened that's what they think
if you're new to me
that didn't happen
it's the most famous example of fake
news
but at least a third of the country
thinks it actually happened they think
they saw the video
which doesn't exist
they see a fake video but the real one
doesn't exist
all right
so is anybody else having that same
shift
where
where they're starting to believe that
the people consuming a certain kind of
news are just victims
what do you think
does it feel like that
it does i mean i'm actually starting to
feel sorry for them in a genuine way you
know not a not a funny ironic
political way but an actual like
literally i have empathy for them like
oh god
what happened to you
i'm so sorry
like actually literally
i saw a hashtag that uh probably you've
seen before but i hadn't seen it until
now
long-haul tds
hashtag long-haul tds
i thought
oh my god that's exactly what it is it
is long-haul tds
that's exactly what it is
and
it's funny that it has a name
all right um
jeffrey miller says that cnn and msnbc
are ideological stockholm syndrome
monetized
i thought ouch
now if you don't know what stockholm
syndrome is but most of you do
because again
smartest audience in all of politics
right here
but for those two people who dropped in
today who don't know what stockholm
syndrome is has to do with the fact that
if you're captured by bad people
and they hold you long enough
you'll start to identify with them and
become a bad person
so instead of being you know the good
person who is captured by bad people
you just become one of the bad people
because you're hanging around them
listening to their propaganda and
eventually you're like you know
you know you've got a pretty good world
view i'll just join it
so
it does feel like
the the poor victims of the news are
uh instead of seeing themselves as
victims
they've come to identify with their
abusers
literally
literally identifying with their abusers
and adopting the point of view of the
abuser
and i thought usually when you hear an
analogy like this like the analogy is
too far from the actual thing is just a
distraction but this is actually
it's not even an analogy
it's actually an actual description of
what's happening
they are captive victims who have come
to identify with their captives
and their abusers
like literally
right
it started out like an analogy but when
i was done i was like no that's not an
analogy i just described literally
what's happening
so we've got all of our psychological
explanations lined up
too many democrats
twitter is wagging the dog
and stockholm syndrome is locking those
people into some kind of
long-haul tds
so long-haul tds and stockholm syndrome
very similar
two good explanations
of what's happening
and then ron
frye or fray how would you pronounce
f-r-e-y
let's uh let's crowd sources
f-r-e-y
you pronounce that as fry
or frey
you're not helping at all
all your suggestions are both both
directions
all right we're going to call him ron
well ron says twitter is essentially a
political video game
he tweets it's a virtual political world
it has real people and plenty to keep
the engagement moving
right
and i thought to myself
uh
yeah and then it keeps your rating high
to avoid the ratios so you're basically
playing for retreats and subscribers
and he says it's a time vampire
that's the way i play it
do you feel the same thing now of course
i use twitter
for
professional reasons as well as
entertainment so it's different for me
but while i'm on twitter
i'm playing it like a game like a video
game and i'm conscious of it
do you do that
now it could be because i get more i
have more followers so whenever i do
something i get more of an instant
feedback
if you don't have many followers you
probably don't have anything like this
happening but once you reach a certain
number of followers
the number of likes and retweets
become a little dopamine source
and i do check my tweets to see how they
did
and when they did well i go oh
here's another thing i do i mean it's
just so diabolically
disgusting
and yet like all entertainment it's fun
i also checked to see if how many blue
check people
liked or retweeted my content
and i and i
mentally i give them greater weight
should i
well not really
you know they got usually as people got
famous for something unrelated to the
quality of their tweeting
they usually got famous
and for no reason they had anything to
do with
you know how clever they were
so why should i care if a blue check
person retweets me or likes something i
shouldn't
but i guess i'm a little you know
dopamine hit
and i see that when i sometimes if i
like or retweet something
people will talk about it because you
can see they're getting a little dope
being hit as well because i have a big
account
and
anyway
uh i do play it like a game so i'm very
aware of it as a gamified political
thing
let's see what else is going on
do you know kim.com all of you
do you know who he is
kim.com i think he is living in new
zealand somebody give me a
update on that
and he the u.s government went hard at
him for his
uh he had a site where you could steal
copyrighted materials and stuff i guess
is that true
mega upload was his company right and it
got taken down for alleged piracy
reasons
now he's also big on crypto am i right
he's a
big in crypto
well he had a
tweet thread today
that is the scariest thing um
i've read in a long time
and here's the problem
i can't figure out where he's wrong
i think he is wrong
but it might be just my wishful thinking
now i don't usually go this dark
because i don't want to leave you with a
sort of thought
but it's the darkest thought i've ever
seen
and so for a while i thought i was going
to ignore it
but then i thought
i don't know that i can and it goes like
this the i'll summarize his argument
if you took all of the assets of all the
corporations and richest people in the
united states and added them together it
would come nowhere near close to paying
off the national debt
which is growing every day
and
the only reason that we've gotten away
with it basically we're already bankrupt
as a country would be his his statement
the only reason we've gotten away with
it
is because the u.s dollar is the
uh
reserve currency
how many of you know what that even
means
do you know what it means to have that
the u.s dollar is the reserve currency
because we talk about it all the time or
it's in the news all the time i'll bet
no more than
10 to 20 of the public knows what that
even means
10 i would say
all right here's the
yeah the quick and dirty explanation
it's a reserve currency
because it's the one that everybody will
agree to take
so if you're buying or selling something
with other countries
you can be sure that they would be
willing to you know buy and sell in
dollars so you better have some of those
dollars there so you can buy stuff in
dollars and they can pay you in dollars
so basically no matter what currency you
have
you also have to deal in dollars
because it's the one that everybody will
take now what happens if that changes
what happens if people say you know this
dollar is getting kind of sketchy
we'll take other stuff
well the whole thing can fall apart
pretty quickly
and we're we're running as fast as we
can in the direction of making all money
worthless
and there's nothing that looks like it's
going to stop it
now that's the nature of all problems
though right
climate change a few years ago it looked
like nothing was going to stop it
today
yeah it looks like we'll get a good
handle on it
but that changed only in the last year
or so when we got real serious about
nuclear and you know we got real serious
about scrubbing scrubbers taking co2 out
and
got serious about how to remediate
things so that we can survive the
damage better
so here's the thing
we have a
financial
armageddon
which is forming and has formed and is
just getting bigger
and it's sort of a
end of civilization problem
and nobody has any solution for it
because you can't just keep spending
money you don't have
forever like at some point it all falls
apart
and kim.com is basically saying uh
everybody's lying to you and they know
it's going to all fall apart
because there's no way it can't
that's the scariest thing i've ever
heard in my life
scariest thing ever and then you know
people are suggesting oh that's what the
great reset is all about
driving driving this system into failure
so that it can be redone in some
socialist way i guess
all right here's
my take
number one
if you don't own a little bit
of bitcoin
you might want to rethink that
i'm never going to be the one who tells
you to own a lot of bitcoin
because i don't think that would be a
good idea
it could turn out for some people but
it's not like a good risk reward kind of
thing
but
if you don't have any crypto
there is some chance
that you will not have money at some day
because it might be the only money at
some point
i don't know that i'd say the odds of it
are not that high
but
uh yeah don't trust gold necessarily
because all these things are
uh
things that can change based on the
psychology they can change too quickly
but i think i think you want to have a
little bit of crypto
you should have a little bit
it might be the only way to buy food at
some point
and i do think there's a very good
chance
that i've worked all of my life to reach
a certain level of
financial comfort
and i think there's a pretty good chance
i will lose all of it
i think there's a pretty good chance
maybe 20 25
chance that i'll lose all of it
not because of me specifically
but because we'll all lose all of it
that's a very distinct possibility
now would we all die
probably not
probably not we'd probably adjust
now i've been saying for some time that
the
the uh
uh yeah but you're old
you're right
i do have the advantage that at least i
got old before we ran out of money i
don't know if it's going to happen but
here's what i think will probably happen
like everything else in the world that
looks like the end of the world problems
if we have enough time to fix it
we figure it out
so i think this will be the same
what's different is i'm not sure the
whole world realizes how big the problem
is
i think the whole world is like ah
somebody has this somebody will figure
it out but it's like climate change you
have to you have to get like the entire
mind of the world on this problem or
nothing's going to happen
and here's what i think is going to
happen
i believe that a second economy will
emerge
that we're going to have two economies
you could argue we already do but the
second economy will be how to live the
least expensive lifestyle
that's still actually pretty awesome
and i think that will have to do with
completely changing how we create food
completely changing how we insure each
other and do health care completely
changing what it costs to live cost
about housing
all of that
and i think that we will create parallel
cities
that will just you know work um in a way
that people have very little money
but they don't need any
and they're perfectly happy
and the other people will get to you
know pursue
growth and
riches
through the other system
which would have to operate at the same
time
and you can get what you want to so you
can live in a big house with all the
problems
let me let me give you just a preview
of what it's like to have too much money
and if anybody is in the same situation
you can jump in here
i spend most
well not most
a huge part of every day
i spend trying to repair something i own
that broke
every day
and
it's it's just monstrously burdensome
like you know at any given day my car
makes all kinds of noises and i need to
spend a full day to get my car fixed
but
i could also just make the warning light
go off because it's not an important one
and drive it
so for several months every time i get
my car it goes bang bang bang bang bang
bang and i have to turn off the warning
light and then every few minutes it
comes back on i have to turn it off
i will drive that car
for probably another year
until something breaks that's bad enough
that i can't drive it anymore
but everything i use is broken
everything
like i tried to just plug in you know
something into an outlet yesterday the
outlet doesn't work it needs to be
replaced it's a gfi
and
all day long i'm
turning something on that doesn't work
getting in my car that's broken
walking through a door that needs to be
fixed because there's a squeak
everything in my environment is broken
all of it
you've seen
you've seen me
debate with my printer every day that's
just one thing in my house do you know
how many things are broken in my life
right now
a lot
i missed my deadline for the first time
ever in comics
in 33 years i missed it on friday
because equipment failure right so
having money becomes this
gigantic time sink of
things you wish you weren't working on
do you know why i like going on vacation
do you know why i
like going on vacation now keep in mind
that my home
is like a resort
right i built my house would have like
all the toys i need and stuff
but i like going on vacation because
to get away from my stuff
i go on vacation to get away from my
possessions
true
to get away from my possessions
and i go someplace where i don't have
anything but a suitcase
and then my mind is clear
and i wake up and i don't have to fix
anything
there's nothing to be fixed
and my dog's not like
my dog isn't
begging at me
nobody's telling me i gotta go fix
something nobody's bringing me an
emergency of the day
i take vacations to get away from my
normal life
of having too much money
that's a real thing
i have to get away from my own money to
relax
that's actually true
i'm not complaining compared to not
having money right so just to be clear
i would much rather have these problems
than other problems there's yeah there's
a trade-off
but if you think it's easy
just because you got all the stuff you
want it's really not it's not even close
to easy there's a reason i only have one
car
because two cars would just break me
i couldn't handle two cars
all right
here's another cataclysmic event coming
so
china's population is set to shrink for
the first time in 60 years
even though they have a three-child
policy now instead of their old
one-child policy
so it turns out that making money and
being prosperous
uh we've known this for a while reduces
your birth rate quite a bit
because as soon as people get a little
prosperity they say you know
maybe one child is fine because i'm
going to need all of my time to handle
all of my possessions i don't have time
for kids
and
so china is going to shrink and elon
musk who's been warning about this for a
while
he tweeted this he said
most people still think china has a
one-child policy
china had its lowest birthday ever last
year despite having a three-child policy
at current birth rates china will lose
40 percent of its people every
generation
population collapse
and i looked at that number and like
well surely
surely that number can't be right you're
not going to lose 40 percent of your
people every generation
and then i thought well wait a minute is
elon musk saying this and he knows how
to do math
probably he did the math right you know
in a general sense
and i looked at it a little more and i
thought oh
yeah
over a generation
because every generation has to replace
about 40 of itself
right
if you wait two generations you're
pretty much all gone
everybody's dead
everybody is grandfathered out so if you
don't replace 40 of your people every
generation you run out of people really
quickly
and i thought to myself holy
this is a big problem
now elon musk personally is having
multiple kids because he can afford them
and he thinks the world needs more
children not not fewer
and i think
he's right
so population collapse is a much bigger
problem than population
over population
now how does this tie into immigration
uh here's where it gets dicey
so do you know what i've been saying
about immigration policy forever
i've always said the same
you should separate the question of
whether you can control your border
from the question of how many people to
let in we treat him like it's the same
thing
and that's just stupid time
it's not
you should have full control of who you
let in
and then decide when to dial it up and
when to dial it down
and we should be driven by economics
more than other things you know you have
to look at crime and
pandemics and stuff too
but the main thing should be economics
and when elon musk says and this is a
warning you should all take seriously
that you could have population collapse
if we don't have enough replacement
people
that's a big big problem
that's a that's a like end of your
country problem
but
how big a problem is immigration itself
from the southern border the way it's
happening
i don't know
but i would love to have some people who
know more than i do some actually
economists
do the work and say look we've got two
worlds
we'll we'll game one forward in which we
don't have enough extra people
and then we'll do one where we have more
extra people than we wanted
but they're also driving the economic
engine
which of those is the bigger problem
do you think you know
because i don't think i know
if you had a choice of these two things
stopping immigration completely
at the southern border
or letting it run exactly the way it's
running which is sort of out of control
which one makes you more money in the
long run
you don't know
you think you do
you think you do but you don't
because more people is more money
more people is more money
so
if you say to me scott we need to close
this border because of all these people
getting through i say to you you have
confused two on two topics
get them straight
number one topic is can you control the
border i say control control the hell
out of it you should control that border
as much as anything can be controlled
in fact it should be one of the main
things we control
because we can
if it's possible to control it and it's
important
control the hell out of it it's the way
you should run your life as well
if there's something in your life that
you can control
such as your fitness
your diet
your fashion
you should control the hell out of those
like those should be controlled like
nothing's ever been controlled
because you can and they have a really
big payoff
immigration is like that too it could be
our greatest economic asset
that we're treating it as just
like an open wound or something
so i don't think that we've ever been
smart on either side of the debate
the smart way to approach it is to
separate the ability to close the border
from the actual doing of it and let your
economist tell you if you need more
people or fewer and then just
follow the economics
in fact one of the biggest things we
have going compared to china is that
people want to go come here
that might be all that matters
in the long run
it might be the only thing that matters
is how many people would rather let live
here
to so
so to me it seems like keeping our
freedom alive
and uh keeping our
environment clean
so that we've got all the tourism and
people want to live here and it's just a
nice place to live is going to be the
economic engine for everything in the
future
i also think it's less likely that you
have a
uh
a big war among superpowers if you've
if you've merged populations a little
bit it'd be too many people who say no
all right
so those are the big scary things that
are happening if i had to guess we'll be
fine
i just don't know how
there are a lot of problems in this
world that will probably be fixed by
people who do know how to solve them the
fact that i don't know how to solve it
bothers me but it doesn't mean it's
unsolvable
does the adam's law of slow-moving
disasters always work and the answer is
we're here
if it didn't always works as a
civilization would have been destroyed
by now by starvation or lack of oil or
any one of those many things you know
the hole in the ozone layer
uh those things were all supposed to end
us by now so it's always worked so far
always worked so far
and i would guess that we'll have some
kind of huge economic
let's say evolution
that is going to make rich people poor
and poor people
less poor and a whole bunch of things
are going to change
and it will probably be worse before
it's better
but i think we can figure it out
somehow
yeah
i think we should take control of the
great reset instead of let it happen
um
so i'm not sure what other people mean
by the replacement theory or the great
reset or whatever but i think that we
just need to acknowledge
that we need two separate economic
systems running simultaneously
one of them that's closer to communism
for people who want to live like that
but it shouldn't have any impact on the
rest of us you know somebody wants to
create a city
in which they're experimenting with low
price everything
but let me just give you one example of
how much
uh
we could change the cost of living
number one you could build a home that
needs practically no energy
so you could eliminate energy
practically
you could imagine how many times food
changes hands and packaging and
containers
from the farm to your table
i complain about this all the time you
know the farmer picks it puts in a barn
that gets taken to a processing place
that gets taken somewhere else that gets
put in a package that gets put on the
shelf you know a truck and then the
shelf and then the shelf goes into your
basket your basket goes on the cart the
car goes on the
payment thing and then the payment thing
back in the bag and then back in your
car and then back in your house
almost everything we do
is impossibly
inefficient
it's just we've evolved to the point
where we can make it work anyway
scott it sounds like you were grooming
us to accept the great reset
um
no
i'm not
i'm telling you to control it because
it's coming
if you control it you'll be fine
and but what i mean by controlling it is
saying hey
you know there are a whole bunch of
ideas that people want to test
for example do you think you could build
a
community that didn't need police
i do
i do if you built it from scratch
you could be you could build a community
that actually didn't need any police
now if something super bad happened
you'd have to call somebody in or
something so there's some case where you
need
something like that but you could almost
completely eliminate the police
here's how
build your new community to operate on
facial recognition
and maybe fingerprints as a backup or
something but basically get rid of all
money
off physical money
that eliminates half of all crime
if the only way you can pay for
something is with your actual identity
and nothing else works there's just
there's no car there's no money nothing
else works it's just your identity
half of all crime just went away
now put
functional cameras in all your public
spaces
it's pretty close to
what it's like now
but really make sure there are no empty
spots
what would that do to your uh
what would that do to your crime
most of it would go away
most of it would go away would you need
a weapon for self-defense
in such a place
probably not i mean you still have your
second amendment right
but if you could imagine a place
let's see if you can
can you imagine a situation that is so
naturally safe
that introducing a gun of your own god
let's say for self-defense
would make you feel less safe
could you imagine it
i can that's easy to imagine someplace
so safe
that the introduction of a firearm
unambiguously makes you less safe
even if it's your own weapon
okay now some of you maybe you're you
have military training and stuff that's
a special case you're probably
completely safe with a weapon
but even you know people taking their
own lives on a bad day you don't really
want that gun lying around right
so here's my point
when i describe this town of no privacy
and
no gun ownership it's still legal you
just wouldn't want one
you say to yourself my god i would never
live there it's the end of civilization
uh you know they would control us in
every way to which i say that's right so
don't live there
if i told you it was mandatory
i'd be the worst person in the world if
i told you look
your two options are you can be poor and
struggling the old way
or you can live in this awesome place
that doesn't have any privacy
but
anytime you want to leave you can leave
anytime you want to leave you can leave
just go get a job in the regular other
economy and do whatever everybody else
does
but if you want to give up your
privacy
not all of it
right you still the things you do in
your own home or private but if you want
to give up some of your privacy
to live
a life that would be
insanely well designed
socially and economically and everything
else
why not have that option
now i'm triggering all the npcs here
all right
if anything that i ever say causes you
to refer to soylent green
1984
or the matrix
you're at the wrong live stream
because that just means you're being
reminded of other things
they have no role in this conversation
nothing i said
should make you think of any of those
things
and or the stafford wives yet so the the
moment you're making a movie or book
reference
you're just not part of the conversation
anymore
walking dead
oh escape from new york yeah
add escape from new york
you can reference my books and that's
genius
scott you're maverick speaking of
maverick
mike cerovich was retweeting
tom cruise
an old interview we did with
matt lauer
in which tom cruise was
mocking
modern psychiatry and the drugs that
they gave you for depression i guess he
got in trouble with it years ago
something about brook shields and
maybe mention she shouldn't have been
taking meds or something
so i forget the exact story
but
as
mike ceravich was noting that it aged
well
do you remember originally when tom
cruise was yelling that psychi
psychiatry was a fake science
and that
they were just masking the problem with
drugs and they weren't dealing with
anything underlying
now
i don't get my medical advice from tom
cruise
nor would he want you to i imagine
but
i think he overdid it
i think he overdid
his
skepticism i do think that there are
some people whose brains are just on
fire and if you have to drug them to put
out the fire maybe you just have to
but
his main topic was ritalin yeah so he
was talking about giving dangerous
street drugs to kids adderall and real
ritalin
and
i'm not going to say that i agreed with
everything that tom cruise says because
i feel like he threw out a little bit of
baby with the bath water there
but it is very instructive
to see how close to being
right he was
and he got there early
and scientology helped him get there
which is interesting
um
now one of the things that i've been
saying watching this tom cruise
uh
stuff happening
especially with the top gun movie and
now he's got another movie come out
and
you've heard me say
that tom cruise is deeply underrated
because you think of him as you know
crazy actor guy
which he is
but i kept looking at what he
accomplished in terms of how he managed
his projects through the pandemic
and how he managed to create a movie
that
really is just brilliant it's just it's
just brilliant
and
i thought to myself he is way underrated
as just a thinker and as an effective
entrepreneur
if you look at the things he does and
can do
he's got a talent stack that's crazy
and so his his movie success is somewhat
secondary
to his business success in my opinion
yeah i think his business success is
crazy
he's just a really good business person
and
uh and when you hear his opinions on
psychiatry
which i again i'm not i don't agree with
him completely
but he was so close to being ahead of
the curve on that
that you have to give him credit for
that so i'm going to give him credit
for being far righter than most people
were on that topic
can the law of slow-moving disasters get
someone off of
prisoner island it's too many concepts
you're
connecting there
uh jennifer connolly said she flew with
him because he's an expert
yeah apparently he has a real estate
license
and he can fly a number of different
planes and jets he has a commercial
license those are all really hard to get
by the way
which probably means he can fly by
instruments which is really hard
um
all right scott lots people think that
about the psychiatrists yes
they do now they do but it was i think
it was gutsy for him to say it publicly
when he did
it would be less gutsy now
um
yeah john travolta is also expert pilot
interesting that they all they all
enjoyed flying
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is all i have
for today
and i think it's a perfect day
i think once again that coffee with
scott adams was the highlight
of your day probably going to get better
from here but so far
best ever
and
today is my
i say ninth day
of
covid quarantine
tomorrow
10th day
freedom
freedom
almost free
how am i feeling well let's talk about
lauren covent
so i've been told that you might one
might experience good days and bad days
um
yesterday for most of the day i didn't
feel
that
bone tired stuff
in fact i
got a new e-bike
and took that for a ride
but i have to admit you know even though
it was an e-bike so it was easy to ride
you know i made it a little challenging
by
turning down the power and doing some
hills and stuff
but it wasn't the hardest workout i've
ever had
but i couldn't move for the rest of the
day
so by
noon now by noon i've been you know up
by eight out i've been up for eight
hours and i've worked and exercised and
showered and done everything
so by noon when a lot of you are
starting your day i'm almost done with
my day
and
uh just that little bit of exercise
essentially just took me out for the
rest of the night
by noon
i didn't really want to do anything
after that i couldn't work
it wasn't even possible
so i don't know
is that long covered
because it's not
it's not a feeling i'm familiar with
but yet i definitely don't have um the
brain fog
so i had the brain fog for the first few
days and it was very distinct i mean you
can't miss it
really distinct i don't have any of that
and indeed
i've been watching the quality of my
work my writing looks the same
unless my brain fog is preventing me
from seeing that it's worse
but it looks the same so i think
mentally i'm about the same
testing negative is problematic because
apparently you can test positive for
months
you know long after you don't have any
symptoms or you can't spread it
even regular flu makes you
feel weak for several
several days afterwards that's true now
i've also had the experience
of having a normal illness
you know let's say a minor surgery so i
had a minor sinus surgery a few years
ago and it took me months to recover
from just a minor surgery where they
knocked me out
anybody have that experience
it's probably something that happens
after a certain age more and
years before that i'd had another very
minor
surgery on some nerves in my neck for my
voice problem
and
that took months
months to get my strength back from just
a one day
minor operation really
was it a sinus lift
i don't even know what that is
by the way has there ever been a medical
problem with a more awesome sounding
name
because when i when i tell people i have
long covert
i feel a little bit like i'm bragging
you know what i mean
yeah i got i got a long coat
really long it's like so long
yeah it's the best sounding medical
problem you've ever heard in your life
don't cope it
all right no puns
i know you wanted to join in there
all right um i'll keep you uh
informed
so if you if you ask me right now at
this moment i'd say i don't have any
lingering feelings whatsoever
but
ask me again at two o'clock this
afternoon and i'm gonna be staring at
the wall
and it's that staring at the wall thing
that's completely different
because i know what it's like to be
exhausted just you know normal tired it
doesn't feel like that at all
no matter how tired i am normally
i don't want to sit there doing nothing
but but this long covet if that's what
it is
i'm actually happy
just sitting in a chair
and
i don't know what that's about
so it's almost like it made me better
like it cured my
adhd or something
but we'll see
all right um
what kind of e-bike
uh
it's more of a trail bike
so the first e-bike i got was really
just one of the few that was in stock
and it looked kind of it's a trek trek
uh it looked kind of boring and stayed
and i got mocked for it
for not looking cool
uh
and so i got one that looks cool but
it's a monster it's amazing
all right
yeah it's yeah i mean it's off-road
but it just looks better
all right that's
yeah so much for my ego death that's
true
no i don't mind spending money on um
things that work better
so it wasn't if my old bike had
functioned as well as this one did
i wouldn't have replaced it
but i wanted the function
um
forest casket hmm
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you
tomorrow
