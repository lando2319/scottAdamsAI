[Music]
yes there we are again
smoky california i hope uh many of you
live in states where you can
breathe the air and do all those things
but i don't
so it looks like it's going to be weeks
of breathing whatever that is out there
so i'm basically on house arrest
i've got a little asthma issue so i
can't go outside
basically i'm just locked inside for
weeks
weeks and weeks but do i mind
not what i have all of you here no
no it's all good when you're here and
i gotta tell you i i can't quite appreci
um i don't think i could communicate how
much i appreciate
the time we spend together in the
morning during this
coronavirus situation and now the
wildfires
i gotta say it really helps it really
helps to have this connection with
all of you and speaking of connections
wouldn't you like to enjoy the
simultaneous sip all you need is a
copper mugger glass a tanker chelsea
stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous step it happens now
go
shall we start with the good news
everybody everybody wants some good news
all right we'll start with that
there's a report that the university of
pittsburgh
scientists have discovered a biomolecule
biomolecule you know
you should probably practice saying
biomolecule
before you say it out loud for the first
time in your entire life
i have never said the word biomolecule
out loud until just this moment and
well it wasn't it wasn't smooth but
anyway this
biomolecule may neutralize coronavirus
so it's not a vaccine it would be
some kind of biomolecule if it works
apparently it works in animals which
generally is not enough to get excited
there are a lot of things work in
animals
that don't work in people but this
particular
biomolecule and come on you've probably
just said
biomolecule at home just to see if you
could do it didn't you
you did say it out loud biomolecule
and apparently it's in the sort of
general category of things
that are generally safe so it
seems to just rapidly just absolutely
whack the coronavirus
the end and uh
looks promising so we might have
something that's
i don't know how long it would take to
test this but seems promising
my favorite story of the day is uh
internet
uh troll jacob wall
faked an fbi
and an fbi raid on
some guy i think he works with jack
burkman
and so the washington post actually
picked it up as a real story
and i have to admit as fakes go
this was really well done because the
the videos and the pictures of what
looked to be
it really looked like an fba fbi
raid somehow they got fbi jackets and
they
i think they hired actors or something
and he puts on this whole fake fbi raid
and the washington post reported it like
it was real
daily beast was on to him a little bit
early so
that's funny uh now i don't know why
you know i i can't figure out the next
part
you know i understand the part about
okay internet troll
puts on a prank it's not his first rank
and
and it worked really well but was that
the only point
was he just trying to see if he could
get the the news to report
fake news i don't know i'm not sure what
the point of that was
um there will be some interesting news
coming out of
rasmussen a little later today i got a
little heads up
um i won't give you the details but let
me just give you a little tease
so rasmussen of course does polling
and you're going to find out some
details about this but it turns out
and this might come as a surprise to you
this might come as a big surprise so
you know put your seatbelt on because
you're never going to believe this
it turns out that anybody who lived in a
town that had
protest slash riots
not happy about it they're just not
happy about it
and will will it affect their votes
well turns out yes
yes so the people who live in places
affected by the
riots looting slash protesting not so
much the peaceful protesting but
everything that often comes with it
those people
are not happy not happy
and here's the part you didn't know
because
it there are so many protests and
they concentrated on the population
centers
if you said to yourself well if you
added together the entire
real estate that every protest was taken
in the united states
it would be like a pin brick on the big
united states
in terms of space that they occupied you
know
a few streets in each city you know
0.001
of the real estate was affected by these
protests
but it's not really about real estate is
it
it's about people if you happen to live
near
or within driving distance of where
there was looting
it changed your vote not every time
but man people are pissed so where do
you see the details in that
but the biggest news is well let me put
this in
another context as impossible
as this might seem by november
we might be kind of over the coronavirus
i don't mean
over it medically i don't mean over it
in terms of the economy being back to
normal
we won't be over it in terms of what
it's doing to us
but quoting my late mother
who taught me one of the most valuable
things you'll ever know about people
and goes like this if you want to
understand humans
here's the thing we can get used to
anything
including hanging that was her little
saying
you can get used to anything so the
problem with the coronavirus
from the democrats point of view is that
they have this complaint
about the president not handling it the
way they wish it would have been handled
but it's really going to seem like old
news by november
even while we're still experiencing it
because whatever happened in april
it just feels like a hundred years ago
already
and we'll talk a little bit more about
that but um
don't discount the fact that you simply
get used to the coronavirus you just get
used to it
and then whatever is happening at the
moment artificially takes a bigger role
because you were you know just got used
to the other thing so if the protests
are still happening and there's still
new news about it and there's new video
every day
which seems to be the case people are
going to vote
on the protests way more than they're
going to vote on coronavirus
it'll have only to do with the fact that
you just got used to one
and you haven't yet got used to the
other one
all right
let's see uh i want to give you a little
context about
what makes me look at the world a little
differently than other people
i get asked about this a lot people say
to me
scott scott what happened to you that
makes you see the world
differently and i've noticed that there
are people who took
what i would call my journey people who
coincidentally were doing
similar things and had similar
experiences often think the same way i
do
and i thought it'd be useful to show you
what that looks like
here is my path to understanding reality
when i was a little kid i loved optical
illusions
and i loved the fact that your brain had
this
this blind spot you could be looking at
an illusion
and even though you know it's really not
that it looks like it
and so i was always fascinated by how
how easily the brain could be fooled
by an optical illusion something you're
looking right at
then then i started noticing that people
had different religions
i was learning one religion but people
had different ones and i
and even at the young age of 11 i'd be
saying to myself
um okay there i don't know what's going
on
here because these religions are
completely different so
even if i imagine i got lucky
and i got the right one so luckily i was
born into the family that
that had the right religion and all the
other people were getting the wrong
religion
but or maybe everybody had the wrong
religion so there were possibilities but
the one thing i can say for sure
is that everybody who had a different
religion
you could tell that we were not basing
our decisions on
religion on facts so much or at least
not all of the world so we could see the
people would believe
just about anything didn't know who was
right and who was wrong
but it was pretty obvious that billions
of humans who are otherwise normal
can believe just about anything
then i got interested in magic when i
was a little chat
a little kid doing magic tricks and you
start learning
that there are there are predictable
let's say blocks in your brain
there are predictable gaps and blind
spots
so you can craft a variety of different
magic
tricks that take advantage of weaknesses
and perception
now once you start doing enough magic
tricks and you see
you start seeing all the weaknesses and
perception
it changes how you see the world and you
start saying well
if you know if magic tricks can fool
people so easily
maybe i should look into this a little
more i started looking into hypnosis and
then persuasion
and by the time i started analyzing fake
news
i gotta tell you it was easier
it was easier to analyze fake news
and let me give you an example of what
learning magic tricks does if you can
see this here's a penny
all right it's just a penny you can see
it there's nothing in this hand
watch this i'm going to take this penny
i'm just going to put my finger on it
and i'm going to squeeze it until it
becomes a quarter
now sh
you didn't hear that so
learning how easily people could get
fooled primed
me for looking at the fake news there is
a news or there's a little clip that
went around
twitter today that i recognized
immediately as
fake news and it was a clip of biden on
the view from 2019
and the clip was it felt to me like it
was obviously edited
to take out all of his coherent
statements and kind of string together
a whole bunch of hesitant you know
incoherent things
now he is a little bit hesitant and
incoherent
but it was clearly edited to get rid of
all the coherent
parts now i point that out because it's
the same trick
done by the fine people hoax
and what did people say when they saw
the fine people oaks and i said hey
that's a hoax
they all said the same thing the ones
who had been fooled by the hoax
to a person they said scott
it's not a hoax i watched it
i saw it with my own eyes heard it with
my own
ears is real
but then what about this biden video you
watched it with your own eyes
you heard it with your own ears but it's
not real
somebody helpfully showed the the full
video so you can see that it was
doctored
it's just like the magic trick right
you saw a penny in my hand so
it was a penny had to be a penny you saw
it
saw it with your own eyes but it was
just a magic trick
once your brain is primed for looking
for the magic trick you can see it a lot
easier
so um here's here's the correlation
people who were
interested in magic tricks when they
were kids
watch for this correlation they're less
easily fooled by fake news
because they're just primed for it
all right uh the best freudian slip of
the day
was kamala harris referring to quote a
harris administration
and then she corrected it together with
joe biden
so here's what she'll do with a harris
administration uh
together with joe biden now what did i
teach you
before this happened all right if you've
been watching my periscopes you know
one of the things you learn in hypnosis
class
is that these are not accidents now the
first
i don't know a hundred times you see
somebody misspeak
you say to yourself okay that's like a
funny coincidence
because when they misspoke they said
something that it felt like they were
revealing some inner truth but you know
it's just
they just used the wrong word nope
nope once you start paying attention
you'll see it's not an accident now i'm
not going to say it's never an accident
my claim will be that in general it's
actually meaningful
not a hundred percent of the time but it
is more meaningful than not
do you think it's an accident that
kamala harris referred to
a harris administration you don't say
that
out loud unless you've been thinking it
unless it's been part of a conversation
so i think she has revealed
that at the very least there's a
conversation going
about getting rid of biden or how long
you last or something along those
lines um
there's a story which didn't get big
news
i don't know if the major news covered
it but there is a
research institute and a researcher who
is making a claim
that the coronavirus that came out of
the allegedly came out of the
wuhan lab had to be artificial
that's pretty big news right there's a
researcher who seems to know this field
who has a claim that it could not have
been a naturally occurring virus
and that she can tell you exactly how
they made it
now that's a pretty big claim not only
is she saying
that it's man-made but she's claiming
she could make it herself
in other words she already knows the
components if you take this
you take this i think she said in six
months you could make this thing
is that true well i don't know if it's
true but
there's a claim today that the research
institute
had some connection with steve bannon
now steve bannon
has been hammering on china for the
wuhan
you know coronavirus so
that's a little flag you have to ask
yourself huh
why is this not you know the headline
news
and the answer is uh i guess the news
business has decided it's not
entirely credible that doesn't mean it's
false
remember whenever i use the word
credible that doesn't mean true or false
it just means that the nature of it
tells you to be cautious about believing
it that's all
so we'll keep an eye on that um
so here's here's another magic trick and
something that people study magic would
see the
antifa are using a magic trick now most
of you know this
which is and the magic trick is that
they
they name themselves auntie pha and then
they say don't you get it
we're anti-fascists so therefore if
you're against
us you must be a fascist now that's a
magic trick
to force you into thinking a certain way
the real trick is that capitalism and
fascism are the same thing
that's the magic trick so instead of
saying hey
we're going to destroy all capitalism
which you might say to yourself um that
sounds pretty bad
because i'm pretty sure if you destroy
capitalism
we all die or were conquered by china
et cetera and
but the anti-fog gets to say oh
capitalism
who said capitalism i said anti-fascist
i didn't even mention capitalism what's
what's capitalism got to do with it
but here's here's how you know that's
the magic trick
have you ever seen the regular news
interview somebody from
antifa and ask him this question
can you tell us is there such a thing as
a capitalist
system that you would not consider
fascist there isn't
bernie sanders vision of a socialist
version of capitalism would still be
fascist
and this is the thing that the news if
they did their job if if we had a real
news
business they would be calling anti-fall
leaders or
representatives just somebody who could
you know i realize they don't have
leaders in the traditional sense that
they're they're public and identified
they do have some kind of coordination
but they don't seem to have anybody was
the spokesperson
but still you could find people who
would be willing to talk about it
so if we had a real news business they
would call them on and they say
trying to understand anti-fascist
so i have one question could there ever
be a capitalist system
that is not fascist and the answer is
not really
now they might try to finesse it by
saying sure sure
you know if you did everything right but
you really can't build that system
because it would remove incentives
human incentives so it would it would
fall apart
so the fact that this dog is not barking
meaning that the news business
is not giving you any any look
not an approximate one not a not a
glance
not anything about what does that mean
to be anti-fascist
nothing it's just not a topic
that tells you that the magic trick is
working
because as soon as they focused on it it
would fall apart
uh all right um do you remember
some of the things that i said in the
beginning of the coronavirus
i told you i thought vitamin d would be
important and now studies seem to be
validating the vitamin d might be
not just important but like really
really important
it's unconfirmed but it's looking that
way and
now there's a forthcoming study from
23andme
showing that your genetic code could
affect
how how much the coronavirus affects you
so remember i told you early on you know
i've got a feeling there's a genetic
correlation here and that if we knew
what that genetic correlation was
we could do way better in protecting
ourselves because we'd know who needs to
be protected
and now sure enough so i say this
because
i always tell you that you should watch
who is predicting well
so on day one practically i was saying
look at genetics
look at vitamin d and
correct correct so
so you have to give me you give me those
check marks that doesn't mean i'm right
on everything and when i'm wrong you
should point it out
and yeah obesity and being
african-american and you know a whole
bunch of
things that increase your risk all right
trump talked to
was in california yesterday talking to
gavin newsom and people about the
forest fires etc now here's a little
fact
that you may not have processed when
you're watching that
it's kind of interesting that trump and
gavin newsom
treat each other with an unusual amount
of respect
wouldn't you say you know they they
differ no doubt
about that but there is there's a level
of respect there that you don't really
it fools you a little bit because he
doesn't seem to be as nice to
every other governor but he's really
nice to gavin newsom
and vice versa but you might not know
that gavin newsom's ex-wife kimberly
guilfoyle
is has of course been with don jr in a
relationship for some time now
and i'm pretty sure fact check me on
this i think that gavin newsom
and kimberly guilfoyle have children
right or one child
i don't know what the situation is but
at least one which would mean that
president trump basically
has a um in effect you know that
who knows what the relationship will
will be in the future
but in effect it's like he has a
grandchild
in law what would you call it you know a
virtual
grandchild his stepson a great a step
grandchildren or something
so gavin newsom and president trump
share family they actually share family
and i think that you have to really have
that filter on
when you see how they interact with each
other
i'm getting confirmation that they they
have a son
and you can't you can't discount how
important that is the the personal
relationship and the president
has been always good with the personal
relationships anyway
what's interesting here is that uh
gavin newsom was very diplomatic by
saying
yes forest management is a thing that
needs to be done better i think we'd all
agree
but he asked the president to be
open-minded
to the difference of opinion about the
importance of climate change
and he the way he worded it was just
really good i
have to admit really good in the sense
that he needed to be
super diplomatic but still get his point
across
i think he did i'd say that
communication wise he did a good job
and then the president because he can't
go five minutes without controversy
i you know i listened to this and i was
thinking to myself
don't say it don't say it
you know don't talk about trump i'm
waiting for him to respond about the
climate
change stuff and the whole time i'm just
no
don't do it don't do it and then the
president smiles and he goes
he goes uh it will get cooler and i'm
like
no oh no oh no
it will get cooler he didn't have to say
that
but i think we're all used to it by now
that whatever is the provocative thing
he's going to say it
if there's a if there's a provocative
way to say something in a
non-provocative way
you might get the provocative one
now here's what's interesting my
criticism of that is only in the way
it's going to make people feel
and you know the politics of it my
criticism of that
is not that he's wrong because my guess
is
that you know temperature will will
probably modulate up and down
i happen to be on the on the side that
says in all likelihood
temperatures are going up on average i
don't think it's the end of the world i
think we'll figure out how to mitigate
and
you know the disasters have gone down
every year
because we're better at managing
everything from hurricanes to floods
you name it forest fires even we're
better at managing in a weird way
there's more to that story but the point
is that we would figure
out how to deal with it even if it's
getting warmer
which it probably is the president
goes for the provocative statement that
it'll get cooler
you just watch now is that true
well it might we might have a few years
where it's a little cooler
on average but i don't think in the long
term it's going to stay cool
i could be wrong you know science
science can surprise you but at this
point i would say the
the the weight of science suggests that
the temperatures will probably go up
we just don't know what that looks like
all right so i wouldn't have said that
if i were the president but i doubt it
changes anything at this point
and i would say this is another example
where and i say this often
if you think there's such a thing as a
good president
and a bad president i think you're wrong
there's no such thing as a good
president and a bad president
there are presidents who are well suited
to certain tasks
and maybe not well suited for others the
president
is just absolutely not suited
for anything but optimism he just
doesn't have a non-optimism mode
he doesn't give bad news now
does that mean he's a bad president no
it means for some things where maybe we
should be a little more worried
people would like to hear him give a
little more negativity
but if you want to get your economy back
who do you want it's like ghostbusters
it's like okay if you want some fake
optimism about something
he's just not always the right guy
because sometimes things need to be
treated more seriously
but if you want to goose the economy if
you want to get
a peace deal with another country if you
want to win
three or four nobel prizes he's your guy
nobody does what he does well
better than he doesn't let me let me put
it in let me frame it in the way you
haven't heard me say before
in my opinion the president is bad at
easy stuff
all right the president president trump
in my opinion
is bad bad does a bad job
at easy things now an easy thing would
be
saying telling the country oh things are
going to be bad
i have great empathy for you let me say
things about
you know to end divisiveness etc
all of the stuff that biden says every
day
is the easy stuff this president
you know waves his hand at the easy
stuff but i don't think he's good at it
i don't think he's good at it but here's
the thing
the president and the reason that i've
supported him from
the start he can do things that are
impossible
so so here's the frame the president can
do things that are literally just
impossible
he's just not good at things that are
easy
now the good news is the easy stuff
doesn't seem to matter as much
does it matter that he he turned
the entire psychology of north korea
around
so that they're not really our enemy
anymore yeah
who thought he could do that it seemed
impossible
and then he did it did you think that
there would be two
peace deals in the middle east nope
it seemed impossible and then he did it
did you think that when he pulled the
the forces
out of the area that the kurds were in
in syria
and all the smart people said no no no
they will be slaughtered that'll be the
worst thing in the world
and then it didn't happen it was
impossible
to pull our troops out without a
slaughter and then he did it
it was fine it was impossible to move
the embassy to jerusalem he did it was
impossible to recognize
the golan heights and they just did it
it was impossible to get
unemployment down to what it was before
the coronavirus
and that he did it how about
telehealth just just a tiny little
example
from a mountain of things that he
changed with executive orders
did you think it was possible that we
would have
telehealth that's now legal across state
lines where it had been banned before
i didn't think so i mean technically
anything's possible
but i didn't think it was going to
happen and he just
signed a piece of paper and it happened
and that was like the law of the land
essentially
and so that's the frame not so good on
little unimportant stuff that where you
have to say things just the right way
but when it comes to things that are
literally
literally considered impossible
he does it routinely how do you not
notice that right how do you not notice
that
somebody says where is kim jong-un
i would have thought about that the
other day i need a fact check on this
but i think i saw the president the
other day
out of the blue with no prompting i
don't think anybody even asked the
question
he tweeted that kim jong-un was
completely healthy
that happened right did we not see
president trump tweeted that kim jong-un
is healthy just the other day
when nobody was questioning it
what's that mean well i think it means
that kim jong-un either asked for a
favor
because maybe he wanted that reported or
the president is just
clever enough that he knows
that treating kim jong-un with even more
respect than you'd expect
giving him a little extra respect in
public
and basically having his back because
that would be a case of having his back
the president just stepped up and he
just had kim jong-un's back
now do you think that kim jong-un is
healthy i don't
i think that his sister maybe
maybe is getting groomed to take over we
we hear the reports of that there's
probably something going on
and it might be a pretty big deal so but
the president played it perfectly
played it perfectly he just give he just
has the kim jong-uns back
and that will be good for the country
all right um the the thing that i wish
trump had said about the forest fires is
that we need nuclear energy
but i think that's just sort of a people
can't quite understand the topic yet
probably 80 percent of the country still
thinks you can't deal with the nuclear
waste you can it's not that big a deal
a lot of the country thinks it's
dangerous
it's not they just are not up to date
and i think the president maybe just
doesn't want that fight
again i'm not a mind reader i would be
only speculating
but it would be the obvious thing to say
and it would be provocative so you would
expect him to go there
but not here's something that somebody
noticed
when gavin newsom was blaming climate
change for the fires
if you see the map the fires go from
the bottom of california to the the top
of
the country and then the fires of which
there are i don't know dozens or
hundreds
and like the whole state of california
looks like it's in fire in different
places
and you go right up to the border of
canada and there's no fires
so after the canadian border no fires
now is the climate that different
a mile on the other side of the border
versus a mile
on our side i don't think so
i don't think it's that different so you
have to ask yourself is it
management of the forest or not now
the thing that i would like to see is
that our forests that have the biggest
risk
we should be cutting these 50-yard paths
crisscrossing them so that there will be
a natural fire break should something
start
but i would also like to see those
50-yard fire breaks through the forest
turned into what what am i going to say
why should all those fire breaks that we
need to build across all these forests
what should they be in addition to fire
breaks
that's right they should be bicycle
paths you should be able to go
anywhere in california on a bicycle
without reaching traffic
you should it just just be bicycle paths
that are also
coincidentally good for the forest
could you charge people a toll to use
the bicycle paths
and use that money to help pay for the
forest um
forest fire forest fire remediation
i would say yes if i could ride a
hundred miles on a bicycle path through
through cool woods and stuff you know as
long as i had a paved path
yeah i'd pay for that absolutely i'd pay
for that a little bit of a toll
um here's a
here's an update cnn after reporting for
months and months and months
ish cnn's been reporting that every
expert will tell you that mail-in votes
are fine
they're fine there's no problem with
mail-in votes the president's a big old
liar
there's no problem mail-in votes they've
worked in other countries they've worked
in other states
they've been working for years nobody's
finding a problem
therefore the president is completely
wrong about the risk of mail-in votes
well until yesterday when cnn
here's the important part cnn is
reporting
that mail-in votes are a total nightmare
and that they're completely inaccurate
and there's plenty of evidence that they
don't work
what did you see that
cnn just did a complete 180.
a complete 180. and they act like
they never said the other thing they
just
they just pretended that months of
reporting about how safe it was
just doesn't exist anymore and now the
report is
wait for it it gets better this isn't
the whole story
it gets better part of the report on cnn
said that one of the reasons that
mail-in votes are so
inaccurate is and i quote
one university of florida study found
black and hispanic voters in the state
were twice as likely to have their
ballots rejected
as white voters
who could have seen that coming
right now this doesn't have anything to
do with being black or hispanic
all right let me be clear about this
this difference almost certainly has to
do with
economics almost certainly has to do
with education which is related right
so if you're in a low socio-economic
group
what are the odds that you're good at
filling out paperwork
right i have a terrible time filling out
any paperwork
even the simplest form i fill in the
wrong blocks and i got the wrong date
and i
i signed my name in the wrong place
so you would expect it's completely
predictable
that the higher educated you are
regardless of ethnicity has nothing to
do with that
but the higher educated you are
you would expect you're more likely to
fill in a form
correctly is that is that even
controversial
the more educated the more likely you
can fill out a form
the more likely you can do anything that
requires a little bit of thinking
so i wouldn't make this a uh
a black and white or hispanic thing has
more to do with education
but the practical impact of it is that
it's racist
male massive mail-in votes are
according to cnn this isn't me
according to cnn mail-in votes the thing
that they've been promoting for months
are racist because that would be the
outcome the black voters would be
disenfranchised
without knowing it because their votes
would be rejected and they wouldn't know
they were rejected
all right here's an update on my who i
call my smartest
democrat friend who is suffering from
tds
here's a list of things he believed a
few weeks ago
all right these are all the things he
believed to be true
he believed that the president suggested
drinking bleach to cure coronavirus
not he believes the fine people hoax he
believed that
the biden doesn't lie trump does
he believed that mail-in voting was
dependable because cnn told them that
last week
before this week
he uh let's see he believed that the
protests were probably about
trump you know trump was the cause of
the protest
uh he believed the russian bounties on
american soldiers which
a report today says they don't have
evidence of that yet
don't know if we ever will but they
don't have evidence of it
and he believed that he still believes
as of this morning
the hydroxyl chloroquine was proven
dangerous
so not so much that it doesn't work
against chronovirus
but he still believes as of today the
coronavirus or that hydroxychloroquine
was shown to be dangerous by science
none of it's true absolutely none of it
so i've been
i've been chipping away at him so you
know i sent him the reports about the
uh the uvc light in a ventilator
that's injecting a disinfectant so now
now he understands
that the drinking bleach thing was a
hoax
i also sent him the cnn update about the
mail-in votes
so now he believes that mail-in votes
are in fact
racist and undependable so once you take
somebody's firm belief
and you completely obliterate it what do
they do
do they say you know i was quite fooled
by that fake news
now that you've informed me i change my
opinion
and i acknowledge that you were right
and man was i completely wrong
up until now thank you for correcting me
did that happen
no no but here's the fun part
what didn't happen is cognitive
dissonance
cognitive dissonance is when somebody
finds their world view is wrong and then
they just spout word salad
instead he simply softly redirected the
conversation
and here was his answer uh he talked
about
voting rights as a partisan issue he
talked about vote suppression
and how not enough people vote so
his answer to everything you believe
from the news about mail and voting
being dependable from the same sources
that told you was dependable
they now say unambiguously it's a mess
he didn't say oh gosh i was wrong
he said there are other problems with
voting unrelated
now what that means is and if you study
persuasion you can
kind of see where this is going that is
somebody who's been persuaded
someone who has not been persuaded would
say something still on the topic but it
just wouldn't make sense
here he's saying things that make
complete sense but he's quite
intentionally changed the conversation
without
without mentioning it that means
bullseye
that he understands that he has been
fooled
and i gave him some other debunks we'll
see if that makes any difference
um i still think the biggest issue about
the coronavirus is the question of
whether the president did enough testing
and when i found out more about other
countries
and how they did allegedly superior
testing i say to myself let's dig into
that a little bit
why is it that some other country did
better testing
then here's south korea the reason that
south korea did so well in testing
there was a private company who when the
news first came out about the
coronavirus they realized that they had
the capability to
quickly and ahead of time i think they
started in
january maybe even sooner i think they
started in january
but they quickly ramped up because they
were a private company
and apparently there was nothing
stopping them from doing it
so they ramped up now would you say then
that south korea their leadership did
better
than the united states to which i say
well
okay you're not analyzing this right if
that private company
that did so well and did a really good
job in south korea
what if that was just an american
company what if an
american company had been as clever as
this private company
would an american company have said you
know they haven't asked for it yet but
i'm going to get busy on this because i
think there could be a billion dollar
opportunity
so we're just going to we're just going
to start making test kits
nobody asked us to it's not approved by
the fda or the cdc
but we're going to do it
is that a leadership thing because i'm
not sure that leadership is even
part of the question if south korea got
their solution because a private company
acted both aggressively and early and
wisely
it took a good risk management approach
that was probably good for their profits
as well
that has nothing to do with management
that's nothing to do with leadership
they just had a company that was pretty
smart
i think germany had a similar situation
in which they just had i think germany
had a private company that
was also big in this space so the
private company
was able to do something quickly with
testing
now in the united states i don't know
the full detail but i guess the cdc's
kits were incomplete
it didn't have all the parts so there
was a part where the cdc fell apart
but where were our private companies i
think our private companies were
probably limited by
maybe fda and cdc
red tape so if there's a criticism about
the president
and there could be by the way i just
don't quite understand this this issue
yet
if there's an issue with president
trump's performance
i would think it would be in the in the
area of
not getting rid of red tape maybe maybe
there was something our private
companies couldn't do
fast enough because maybe they were
barred from doing it
is that a thing so um
there are a lot of people will base
their decision on what they believe
about the president's leadership
on testing and they won't know anything
about what actually happened
they won't know that it was probably
just private companies making good
decisions
in other countries that might be it that
could be the whole story
we don't know uh christopher ruffo
is reporting that you know we thought
that the president
did a executive order banning critical
race theory training
but apparently the cdc is just going to
move ahead and do it anyway
so the cdc is going to have training
classes on critical race theory i think
they tried to
finesse it by not calling it that but it
is
and i have to wonder at what point does
this go to the supreme
court at what point does the supreme
court say
you can't teach this critical race
theory stuff because it's just racist
because it is racist it's obviously
racist it's
gigantically racist so what is that
going to happen
all right um would you like to be
scared about the future of humankind i
can deliver that
and it goes like this in my opinion
the protests and riots that you're
seeing around the country
could not happen without artificial
intelligence
now there could have been some protests
there might have been some things but in
terms of the extent of what we're seeing
and the way it's affecting the country
we would not have this if not for ai
here's what i mean now you're going to
tell me but scott
the kind of ai we have now in our
algorithms etc
is still controlled by people people
program them
people tweak them it's people people
making decisions they're just using ai
as a
convenient tool that i believe
is a mistake in perception what's really
while it is true that the
humans are tweaking them the way you
know in a variety of ways
what's also true is the algorithm forces
the humans to do what the humans do
once the algorithm through trial and
error has determined what gets you the
most profit
the human doesn't have a choice of not
following it because the human will be
fired
if they don't pursue profit so you say
to yourself but the human has a choice
they don't have to do what the ai says
just because the ai says
let's feed these ads or this this news
to people because it'll get them all
worked up and
they'll be angry and then they'll click
more the human
you could say in some technical sense
they could decide not to do it
but then they would be fired and then
the next person would do it
so you don't really in a practical sense
have any way to fight the artificial
intelligence
once it decides that this is how you
make money
you're going to do it that's the way
humans are wired
so we are already at the point
where ai controls
humanity you know a lot of people are
worried like what happens someday
when the ai gets smart enough that you
know it's
it's sentient and then it's making our
decisions well i don't think you could
argue it's
sentient but it's already making the
decisions
that is literally true ai is determining
how mad you are what news you saw
and what you clicked on and that will
determine the government
because our government has to react to
what the the news and the public
collectively want right the government
in
some cases you know in limited cases can
do something the public isn't demanding
but for the most part
they have to do what the public demands
and the public is only demanding
what the news and social media tells
them to think
and it always does that because the ai
is telling them what to think
so for all practical practical purposes
artificial intelligence is running the
united states
it is that it's already done so
there's that um
bloom mike bloomberg is going to spend
100 million dollars
in florida trying to make sure that the
democrats win florida
and i i thought to myself all right i
believe in free speech and people should
be able to use their money the way they
want
but when when the founders of this
country were designing a system
at what point did they understand that
one person could spend a hundred million
dollars in a swing state and determine
the election
would that be legal do you think
if the founders knew that could have
happened i mean i don't think they could
have conceived
of somebody with so much money that
would have been hard to imagine
although you could argue that george
washington was one of the richest people
in the world
if you normalize it
[Music]
but why is that legal
i understand that it is legal but
shouldn't we look into that a little bit
could you know i feel like there should
be some kind of
limit on what one person can do you know
if you said to me well
mike bloomberg can put in up to 10
million dollars that's still a ton of
money
but i'd say all right all right because
there'll be other billionaires that put
10 million the other way
but to have one person put a 100 million
into one swing state or one that could
be a swing state
that's that's a big risk to the republic
i'm surprised that that's legal
all right um that
is all i wanted to talk about somebody
says you don't even vote
so this year i am going to vote i
registered to vote this year
the only reason i'm registering to vote
this year is first self-defense
because i do think that this is this
year is unusual
and i think that anybody who supported
trump
would be in a lot of trouble if he
doesn't win
there could be violence there could be
discrimination there could be
any any norm any number of things that
could be bad
so just for self-defense i'll be voting
for trump
there you go all right um
what does he get in return what does
bloomberg get in return
yeah it's a good question isn't it
somebody says kimberly's son was from a
prior managed
marriage you mean before gavin newsom
we'll do a fact check on that because i
might be wrong about her
her son but there's still there's still
a
connection with gavin newsom even if
it's indirect
all right the slaughter meter is the
slaughter meter is at about 200 percent
at the moment
um almost every day that goes by
it looks better for trump and worse for
biden
and i until that changes
this slaughter meter said about 200 all
right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you later
