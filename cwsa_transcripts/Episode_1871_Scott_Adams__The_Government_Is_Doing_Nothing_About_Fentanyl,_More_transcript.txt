good morning everybody
and welcome to the happiest place in the
world no not disneyland no
no it's coffee with scott adams and it's
the best thing that's ever happened to
anybody
and let's take it up to
stratospheric levels
in order to do that we'll need something
you'll need something
something to hold your beverage and all
you need is a cupper mug or a glass of
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
aha
that's so good
pardon my caffeine orgasm it was good
for me
well i continue my quest to fly as close
to the sun as i can
the dilbert comic has only been
partially cancelled so far
meaning that some of the large newspaper
chains
have stopped running it
i don't know if they're cancelling it
we're just now running it because of the
content but i continue to hit this theme
of esg
today's comic will feature um the ceo
talking to catbert the head of head of
hr having a little conversation there
and i'll read it to you uh the ceo says
to kat bert
our esg score will drop if we open a new
factory that adds co2 to the atmosphere
the co ceo goes on but we can balance
that out by adding more diversity to our
board
and capper says how much co2 do you plan
to add
and the ceo says
one non-binary board member's worth
that's right
if you're measuring esg
you've got a score for environment and
social things and governance and
diversity and all that stuff
and
it seems to me that if you're
feeling a little weak in one
you could balance that out by being a
little stronger in the other right
now in reality they probably give
individual grades for all that stuff
but i thought it was funnier to treat it
like it was one grade
because in effect it will be
now how many of you have been involved
in any kind of a large organization
that had any kind of data
that it needed to track and report to
people is anybody involved in that that
situation a large organization
where you had to collect data
now esg is something that large
organizations are doing
that is being sort of imposed from the
outside these standards for
their environmental policies and their
social policies and their governance
so you got all these outside forces what
happens in a situation
where you have outside forces
telling you to measure something
that is very subjective
another no well it's not subjective
conceptually
that's not subjective at all
but if you're going to decide what data
counts and what doesn't
it starts getting really subjective
so you've got the most subjective
situation you could
you know for example
if you looked at a at a company's uh
environmental impact
should you also consider their
suppliers
how do you decide that
now i think the answer is yes you do
consider their suppliers because the
suppliers are part of the larger
environmental thing so the answer is yes
all right now that's easy right very
objective
but
what if one of the suppliers has no
alternative
what if you can't make the thing you
make
without using that supplier and that
supplier is a little bit of a problem
and what if the thing you make is just
essential for the country
it's not like an iphone like food or
energy or something
right so you have all these situations
where you might find that the only way
to do something that's essential for the
world
is to
put off a little more co2 than you want
to in one little area
so what what does a company do
when they've got a bad
a bad score
and the only people who have access to
the raw data
is the company itself
so only the company itself
really knows all of its inputs and
outputs
and it gets to self-report
what it's doing
how in the world can these numbers be
useful and really comparable to anything
else they couldn't possibly be
by design this is a system that's
designed
it's designed to create liars out of
everybody
that's what it's designed to do now not
intentionally
but the design of it will force people
to lie just to get through the day
yeah
yeah that wasn't our co2 that was a
a vendor
but we we don't use that vendor anymore
you know it's gonna be there's gonna be
oh yeah green washing will be the name
for it
so
i'm still still after esga remember i
promised you that i would
kill it by the end of the year now of
course it's not the sort of thing that
could ever be completely killed
but by the end of the year
i want everybody to know that
the popular view of it is that it's
meaning the the
the view not from the top is that it's
and the dilbert comic does that it kind
of kind of sends that message that
the
the uh the common view of it is
so we'll see if that makes a difference
biden continues to divide the country
successfully
so there's a new harvard harris poll
it says 73 percent of democrats and even
20 percent of republicans which is
shocking when you hear this
so 73 percent of democrats and even 20
percent of republicans
and even 42 percent of independents
believe the following statement is true
that there are tens of millions of
dangerous mega mega-republicans
backing violence and trying to overthrow
the constitution
tens of millions
what
our president
president dunfuck biden
managed to convince the country
that there are tens of millions of
dangerous mega republicans
who are looking to use violence to
overthrow the constitution
do you know what
maga republicans don't do
overthrow the constitution
is literally the opposite of what they
do
like how can you convince
well i guess it's easy
73 of democrats
that wet is dry up is down
you know blue is orange
i mean literally if you were to define
what a mega republican is
wouldn't you start with
don't change the constitution
that's where you start that's the most
basic assumption is don't
you know don't
all right we'll hide you
so most basic assumption
and
what do you do with the president who
convinces the country that is having an
imaginary civil war
i i feel like that's the worst president
you could possibly have
somebody who convinces you that you're
in a civil war when you're not
has anybody walked outside in the last
few weeks
how was the war
was it dangerous
did you run into any of the tens of
millions of dangerous mega
republicans looking to overthrow your
constitution
you know when i joke about the fact that
we're having an imaginary civil war
that's not a joke
we are literally
literally
experiencing the mental equivalent
of an imaginary civil war
which apparently 73 of democrats believe
they're right in the middle of it
like the war the imaginary war is
blazing away
and people have taken sides and
you know all kinds of dangerous mega
republicans backing violence to
overthrow the constitution
now i guess that's the weirdest part if
you had told me
if you told me that democrats have
persuaded the country that mega
republicans
were just bad
just let's say just generically bad in
whatever way
i would say all right well okay maybe
maybe from your point of view
they're bad and there are tens of
millions of mega republicans
so i think if there was a general a
general kind of insult i'd say okay
that's just politics
but when you say that they are the
opposite of what they are
i don't even know what that is
to say that mega republicans want to
overthrow the constitution
when it's literally the definition of
the opposite of what they are
and yet 73 percent of
democrats are like uh-huh
and 20 of republicans
also believe
that all these imaginary mega
anti-constitutional people exist
it's really mind-boggling that something
that a lie this big could be so
successful
but
here we are well here's the good news
apparently there's a company that did is
completing a one-year test
to see if they can make energy out of
the ocean
the ocean waves specifically
and they created some kind of an
artificial blow hole
do you ever see a blowhole there's one
in maui that's kind of cool
every time the wave comes in it creates
a little
pressure thing it shoots water up in the
sky from a hole
well they've created an artificial one
that
uses the wave action to create an
artificial blowhole to move a generator
and apparently it worked
it worked it's off the course of
australia now the beauty
now it's not it's not really refined yet
the design apparently
works but it's not super efficient
compared to other things and not even
super reliable compared to other things
but it's getting there
so
i've always wondered why we couldn't
harness
ocean movement
given that ocean movement is pretty
predictable right and pretty
pretty dramatic i mean the ocean's
pretty heavy
you can move a lot of stuff
so it always seemed to me that ocean
power was the obvious way to go
and i was always a little surprised we
hadn't gotten there yet tides and
whatnot
it kills sea life
does it
i don't think it has to
but i see your point it seems like if
you put a big noisy mechanical thing in
the ocean
that couldn't possibly be good for the
sea life that's a good point
but it does seem to me that that now the
design that i imagined was simpler
the design i imagined was
that sitting on the top there'd be a
buoy
and as the waves go up and down the buoy
would go up and down and the buoy would
be attached to some kind of a generator
that the up and down motion
generates something now it seems to me
that would be the most obvious
but it's probably pretty hard to
engineer
maintenance nightmare yeah you're right
yeah it's probably really hard to
engineer something where the exact
motion
is super variable
yeah
title generators are a thing but i
expected them to be much bigger
all right
anyway that's a little good news
um i'm so happy to see that the
political right especially the media
has picked up a trick from the left
let's see if you notice the trick
i think it was in the washington
examiner was it
there was a report of an anonymous fbi
source
anonymous source
who says that
the fbi is trying too hard to like find
white supremacists
and that the supply of white
supremacists is too low for the demand
the demand for white supremacists is
higher than the supply
from uh
it's from a anonymous
anonymous source within the fbi
huh
an anonymous source
who's saying exactly what one political
side says
it's right on the nose isn't it
right on the nose
not only do they say what you want to
hear but they even use the same language
how many times have you heard the
um and it's a clever and true statement
that the supply of
white supremacists is too low for the
demand
right
that is way too non-credible
now
let's make you feel ashamed
how many of you automatically believed
the story was true because it agreed
with exactly what you think is true
did anybody just like automatically
believe that story
some of you did that's that's how
confirmation bias works now keep in mind
i'm not telling you it isn't true how
would i know
i don't know that i'm just saying that
if you make it a habit
of believing an anonymous source
who says something that's exactly what
the people who are not anonymous sources
are saying
the odds of it being true are very low
very low
now let me let me make sure that i'm
being careful here i definitely believe
that what the alleged whistleblower is
saying
is almost certainly true
i don't believe there's an alleged
whistleblower
saying it
it just probably is one of those things
is
obviously true but you need somebody to
say it so you invent them now i'm not
saying he was invented could be true
just don't don't assume there's any
credibility to an anonymous source
um but it does seem to me
that it is almost it's almost got to be
true that the fbi is trying hard to turn
things into white supremacy right
don't you think that that the general
idea
that the government has given directions
to make sure you find as much of this
white supremacy as you can even if you
have to
you know shade it a little bit you know
what i mean
if you got to be a little uh subjective
a little bit subjective about why you
call white supremacists
so that's going on
elon musk tweeted that his tweets are
being suppressed
and i wondered if he had stopped
tweeting
because i had noticed he was sort of
missing
and that he says his tweets are being
suppressed and i looked at his tweets
and i thought oh
i used to see these all the time
now i don't
um
so i wonder i wonder if this is exactly
what it looks like
because exactly what it looks like
is that
elon
accused twitter of
messing with the algorithm
and then they got mad at elon musk and
so they messed with the algorithm to
suppress them
now i don't know if that happened
because again this is this is a perfect
confirmation bias trap right
isn't this story
a little too on the nose
yeah you're gonna get sick of me saying
this
but
i'm sorry it's a little on the nose
now i also think it's true
so both both things could be true right
something could be a little too on the
nose
because it's true it doesn't always mean
it's false
uh you know if we assume that twitter
treats everybody the same
then he would probably have some
algorithm and trouble too
right being being on the nose doesn't
mean it didn't happen
it just means that that should that
should alert you to
you know a credibility question that's
all it should do
yeah i don't know
it seems like my twitter account is
being suppressed so why wouldn't his
so i'm assuming it's true
sounds true
what here's the part that i doubt
i doubt that somebody did it
like as a a conscious act i think maybe
the algorithm did it
what do you think
i think the algorithm did it
but maybe it was just part of a you know
some larger algorithmic thing i think
it's happening
i just don't know that somebody went in
and tweaked the code
to suppress elon musk specifically
don't know about that
but it does look like his he's being
suppressed
all right um
thomas massey had a tweet here i guess
biden was on cbs 60 minutes last night
and when asked about the
so-called
secrets from the mar-a-lago boxes
he said that no one has briefed him on
the contents of those national security
secrets
but he thinks that you know other people
are handling it
uh is that a problem
well no matter how you interpret this
it's very bad
i don't think there's a good way to
interpret this is there
can you think of a good way
all right number one
if the contents of those boxes are truly
important meaning that there are secrets
that matter
and the president hasn't been told
that's a very big problem would you
agree
that if what's in there is important
and it's the number one headline etc and
the president of the united states the
keeper of all of our secrets hasn't been
told
hasn't even been told
that's a gigantic gigantic problem you'd
all agree with that right i mean that's
just obvious
now what if he has been told
and he's lying on 60 minutes
well given that the entire reason for
running for president was to stop all
the lying
that's a big problem
it's a really big problem
so
if he's telling the truth it's a big
problem
if he's lying
that's a big problem
what about the other possibility
that there's nothing important in the
documents
and that's the reason he hasn't been
told
that's a big problem
that's a really big problem
is there a third possibility that's not
a really big problem
because these are all flaming red flags
that the country is being screwed
aggressively like right in front of you
and it doesn't matter which one of those
is true
or memory lapse right if it's a memory
lapse it's a big problem
every every spin you could put on this
no matter how you interpret what it
means
it's a big problem
in terms of
you know the quality of our presidenting
so
i guess we've just gotten so beaten down
by uh incompetence or the appearance of
it that we're willing to accept just
about anything now it's like anything
goes at this point just crazy stuff
all right what do you do in a country
where everybody's
crazy and nothing's getting done it
seems like sometimes
well i decided to see if i could take
control of the country
and here's the funniest part about this
you might think i'm kidding
but here's the thing
it's completely doable
that doesn't mean
unlikely to get it done
the odds would be against me
but there's actually
a path for me to take over the country
it's unlikely
it's unlikely and if it worked i'd
probably get assassinated in a day
but the path has opened up
and here's what it looks like
would you agree that neither
neither candidate we assume that it's
going to be trump versus biden starting
to look that way
does it look like anybody has a plan to
do anything about
fentanyl no right
it doesn't look like it
i haven't even seen anybody talk about
it in a way that even seems a little bit
serious not at all
it's like what it might be the biggest
problem you could argue what's the
biggest problem
our government is just missing an action
now we also have a joe manchin
government meaning that things are so
close
that all it takes is one person who is
willing to vote on either side
and that person ends up controlling
stuff
so i'm going to do a joe manchin play
to try to control just enough people
who would be willing to say
they don't have to commit to it there
would be no contract
but people would be willing to say that
they would be a single issue voter
this time
and the single issue would be what the
hell are you doing about fentanyl
and i would take i would take an
aggressive plan even if i didn't know if
it'd work
but at least be aggressive about it
and so here's the deal i tweeted that
whoever comes up with the best plan
if we can get 10 million people to
commit
that they will vote for whoever has the
best fentanyl plan now again
they just have to say they would do it
there's no way to check their intention
and there's no way to check if they
voted it's not a contract right you're
not you're not agreeing
nobody's going to say you broke your
word right that's that's not part of
this
i'm just saying that if you could get 10
million people to say you know if one of
you came up with something that
looked like an actual plan
you might get my vote
if i can get 10 million people to say
that
then they're going to have to come up
with a plan and they're going to have to
compete
so i don't want to control the country i
want the people who are running to
control the country
to give us a plan
and if one of them wants to compete
there's 10 million votes that are at
least going to be leaning in your
direction more than they would have
right
and yeah that's right i don't vote
but that's a different
topic there's a reason for that
now
someone pointed out on twitter correctly
that i've made this claim before that i
could that i could talk about myself
that i could be a single-issue voter
and i've mentioned different things for
example i could be a single-issue voter
on
a president saying we're going to go
gung-ho for nuclear energy
we're just going to like get rid of
these regulations
we've got to build 20 of these in 10
years whatever it is
it wouldn't matter if it was democrat
or republican
if if any president said that
i would i'd say all right that's
probably so important i'd be willing to
put up with your other badness if i
don't like it
what about the school boards
if a president said my main thing is i'm
going to try to neuter the school boards
and give you school choice
i would say i'm not even sure
i don't care which president that was
i don't care democrat or republican if
you can do that for me
that would be such a big issue that i
might
be influenced by that one topic
now there are other people have their
own one topic right abortion might be
your one topic
and i wouldn't argue with you on that
if that's important to you i'm just
saying that we have a system that
doesn't work
and one solution would be
to force our
politicians to compete
because do you think they're really
competing on policy
do you think biden and trump when they
run together run against each other if
they do do you think that they will
compete on policy
they'll talk about it but not really
not really
because trump will say the same thing he
always said
bible say the same thing he always said
and then you're going to say well what
are either of you going to do about
you know the teachers unions
i think i said school boards instead of
teachers unions i've been teachers
unions
what are you going to do about teachers
unions uh
blah blah nothing what are you gonna do
about fentanyl uh
nothing
they're not competing
so i think you need to make trump
compete he's not competing
what is trump offered nothing right
nothing a return to the way we were
that is so lame and pathetic
we need actual
aggressive plans for making things
better yeah i mean you assume trump
would
tighten up the border and stuff but
that's not going to help you with
fentanyl too much
yeah there's the
the image of the dead people
uh make heroin cheaper than fentanyl you
know let me also say that i don't know
what the right answer is
i don't know what the right answer is
you know some say legalize it all
maybe
i mean it might be
maybe maybe you just test it somewhere
anything you can test i'm not going to
argue about i'm going to say well then
test it
find out
might be exactly what you need
yeah and the people saying that if you
made heroin cheaper and legal
then the fentanyl wouldn't be
competitive
but i don't know
is that the best we can do
is the best we can do
to addict people to heroin instead of
fentanyl
it might be that might actually be the
best we can do
but i think we could try harder than
that
um
so here's the interesting thing
january 6
is this major headline for
you know however many months now
and it's based on the ridiculous
assumption
that whatever happened on january 6 was
something like an insurrection or a coup
when
when nobody can explain how people
walking in into a building
overthrows a country
like nobody can explain that like
okay suppose
suppose they'd all go on in the capitol
and just sort of stay there
does that make them own the country do
they get to make some legislation
because they're squatting in the
building
would we just roll over and say oh well
they got our building
they got our building right so the
ridiculousness of the claim that that
was an insurrection attempt
is insane
but here i'm doing an insurrection
attempt right in front of you and people
will just ignore it
because imagine if this works
everything i'm doing is legal and
transparent so i don't have any legal
risk
but i am
literally
no joke
trying to take control of the government
because if this works it's very low low
likelihood right but if it worked
it would become a model for the next
topic
and then i would just do it again and i
would just joe manchin this thing until
the government had to compete
now what i want is to not have power
i know it's hard to believe
but i don't really want a job
i don't want to run the government you
know make sure the garbage gets picked
up and i don't want to do that
i just want them to compete but if
they're not going to compete i'm just
going to try to take control
so i'm literally going to try to take
control of the government
policy for fentanyl at least
and if it determines who the next
president is
so be it if they don't want to compete
they don't get to win
that's just the way it's supposed to
work
now
what would it take
for me to succeed
so i've got three quarters of a million
twitter followers
it probably would take 10 million
retweets
and then i would actually be in charge
of the country
anybody want to argue with that
10 million retweets on that point
and then people would start following me
to see okay who do you think has the
best fentanyl policy and i would say on
day one i'd say nobody nobody there's
zero competition
so i wouldn't even recommend i would
make no recommendation based on today's
situation
but
if the election heats up and one of them
comes up with an actual plan
then i might
encourage the 10 million to lean in one
direction versus the other
now
it's just sort of a pressure on our our
politicians to do better right to
compete they're just not competing
and
the reason they don't compete is that we
don't make it important for them to
compete
as long as they have your vote reliably
just by making you mad why would they
compete
they could just make you mad
and then you'll vote for their side look
at what that other side is doing
you know if
if the entire election is about how bad
the other team is
that's not even governing
that's nothing
so we've allowed our government to
descend into complete
uselessness
and
maybe there needs to be some
some counter pressure so this is the
offer
and uh
i don't think that i can break out of my
um
social media bubble
you know it would it would have to
penetrate to the democrats to make any
difference at all which i don't think i
can do
but it would only take
it would only take one prominent
democrat to retweet it
and you're off to the races
because that would be news of itself
so
i can't make this happen it would
require you know larger blue checks to
say you know
maybe let's give it a shot
twitter isn't god
okay that was the most useless comment
of the day
thank you for not understanding anything
you read it yeah
if they don't address the hitler if they
don't address the issue they're hitler
all right
um
twitter is a media source all right
give me a uh
give me a reaction to my plan number one
is it feasible that i could ever control
a block of voters
to help them decide on the one issue
which way the lead
is it feasible
it is actually
i think it's feasible now that's
different than being likely
it's very unlikely
because it would be
a remarkable thing if it happened but
it's it's in the realm of things that
can happen because remember the entire
friction
here here's the entire friction
that might be a good idea click
literally i'm just trying to get 10
million people to move a thumb
boop
that's it
just move a thumb read it and go okay
with three quarters of a million people
following him
to move their thumb
click
defense
there's no downside
right nobody's committing all you're
doing is saying well
if this puts pressure on the government
to compete better
everybody wins
make them compete
so i put it out there because i think my
odds of
controlling the country are greater than
the january 6
about that comparison
what what is more likely that i can i
could
wrest control from the government at
least on this topic
or that the january six people could
take over the government
it's not even close
so we don't even know the difference
between wet and dry up and down
here i am literally and publicly
putting a legitimate attempt together to
take control of the government of the
united states at least on this topic
and people will treat that like it's
it's sort of no big deal
but because the press tells you that
january 6 was an insurrection because
some people were in a room
that's the story for two years
all right
i should wear a viking hat that work
what percent of americans are not on
twitter
so that doesn't matter
it doesn't matter how many are not on
twitter
because
the plan doesn't work if it stays on
twitter right so i agree with that
twitter by itself is not big enough but
if something trended on twitter
it would jump over to facebook it would
jump over to instagram it would jump
over to tick tock
so twitter would just be a
you know sort of the uh starter
but after but it would have to you know
get a
get a burn of its own to make a
difference
now
i've been watching your comments go by
and the weirdest thing about this is
there doesn't seem to be much doubt that
it's possible
so we'll see
we'll see
you know it's funny i was i was just
sitting here yesterday
being angry again about the lack of
action on fentanyl
and and when it occurred to me that i
could just change it myself
it was a weirdest thought
i'm just sitting there thinking
i wonder if i could change it
and then i realized
okay i do have the talent in other words
i could frame it in a way that was
compelling
and i almost have enough attention i
don't have enough attention so that the
size of my platform is not nearly big
enough to make this change so i would
have to leave the platform and other
people would have to embrace it at some
scale otherwise it doesn't happen
all right erica if your only job over
here you're not the good erica you're
the bad erica there's a bad erica over
here
so we're gonna hide you on that channel
you're now gone erica
you can comment all you like nobody will
see it
um
wait uh hold on geo mac uh somebody came
in late
we have somebody on youtube came in late
and did not catch the simultaneous hip
we're going to do a makeup step
i don't do this often
you you need to be on time
right and so i don't want to reward
lateness
but i'm going to
how about
the interim interstitial
simultaneous sip
that has never been a thing but could
become a thing because it's so awesome
get ready
for the makeup simultaneously go
that was 50
because i care about my viewers and 50
because i was thirsty
but you put those together
actions
all right i'm going to leave you with uh
one gift
does anybody want a partying gift
i'd like to put this at the end
to train you to stay till the end
because when there's nuggets they'll be
at the end
here comes a nugget
i'm going to hypnotize you
so if that's not for you
you should um
say say good day
i'm not going to pull you into a trance
all right this will be a talking
hypnosis
i'm simply going to reframe something
for you
to take some of your problems away
now actually they won't go away they'll
diminish
which is good
you just want them diminished
now this is a topic that you've heard
before
but what's powerful about this topic is
that each time you hear it
it gets stronger
so it's something that you've thought of
on your own of course what i and what
i'm going to say will be
even obvious
it'll strike you as obvious
but it will still work
because it's an obviousness you want to
focus on
and what becomes true are the things you
spend your time thinking about
so i'm going to change you from thinking
about something else
that maybe was bothersome
to thinking about something that will
make you feel better
and all i'm going to do is change your
focus
and that will be good enough
and now i'm going to do it right in
front of you
you know those things in your past
they're giving you ptsd and trauma and
they're haunting your thoughts
they're part of something that doesn't
exist
history
history doesn't exist
you can't grab a handful of history
it's something that you've made up in
your mind as important
what is true is that you are who you are
right now
that's what's true
release on everything that's happened
until this moment
just imagine yet that you're reborn
imagine that you popped into existence
now
you'll still have those things that feel
like memories but now they're just loose
wiring in your brain
they're not about something that was
real and happened in the past because
the past doesn't exist
they are now nothing but loose wiring in
your brain
and you just popped into existence and
you notice some loose wiring
that's funny that loose wiring is making
me think about something that doesn't
even exist
because it's the past
so it's not really about the past it's
not about anything that's important it's
about a few loose wires
and
how do you make those loose wires stop
bothering you
you're doing it right now
just move to the present
pick up any object on
in front of you just anything i've got
my phone here
you might have a pen or a piece of paper
and just look at it
it exists right now
this is who you are right now
you are the person feeling this and
experiencing this right now
your history
doesn't exist
let it go
you are
what you are right now
this is you
you're you just got reborn
everything that happened before this
doesn't count
unless it was good
it was good you can take it with you and
make yourself feel good but anything
that was bothering you
was just an interpretation
it's not real
your past can't bite you
can't hurt you
it's gone
in fact what could be better
than something that bothered you
being gone
it's gone
you just got reborn
now every time you remind yourself of
this
just touch yourself look around
oh there's nothing in the room here with
me
the only thing in the room here with me
are objects
and the objects are not hurting me i
like these objects i bought them myself
it's just objects
now
having
just experienced this for the last
few minutes
you can already feel it
you can already feel a little weight
come off
and that little feeling you can
reinforce
right it only has to be a small
sensation it could be even smaller than
a feeling
it could be the suggestion of a feeling
or maybe you're feeling it you might say
to yourself i think i felt better
i'm not entirely sure but i think i did
that's all you needed
just work with that spark
remind yourself on it every time that
you need to
that you are what you are right now
you're born right now you just came into
the world
you came into your world fully formed
and that stuff from your past is nothing
but loose wiring
you have a brain that you can author
it's called neuroplasticity as well as a
well-demonstrated thing there's no new
age stuff here
and the well-demonstrated part is that
if you
let's say practice a new skill
your brain actually forms new
connections and little highways and
stuff to support the skill
we know that we through therapy and
other things that you can get rid of
traumas and ptsd in some cases you know
that you can reprogram your brain
and we also know now that the brain
grows new brain cells it used to be that
we thought you were born with a certain
number of brain cells and you just lost
them as you aged turns out no you
actually build new brain cells your
whole life
and
you
can reprogram
those dangling wires
into whatever you want
let's say they have too much of a charge
and that's the problem
they're around some experience or memory
that you didn't like but they have too
much charge when you think about it your
energy just goes to the roof
rewire it into your energy parts
every time you feel energy that's more
energy than you want
just plug that into your fitness routine
do you know what a bad day is for me
a good exercise day
there's no such thing as an entirely bad
day
if your if your day is so bad that it
makes you like anxious and like you're
angry and you're
that's your exercise day
congratulations
you're really going to make a big
difference in your exercise
so
you need to take that wiring this
dangling and that's all it is
because the histories doesn't exist
to imagine that it was caused by
something is useless it just is what it
is you're just born with it
as if you're born today
but
it's true that it creates energy
and it might even seem like negative
energy that little dangling wire in your
head connected to that memory
so just rewire it
stick it into your fitness routine give
yourself a little extra energy run an
extra mile
and make it productive
tomorrow
is also a good place to live if you're
willing to live there productively
some people think about tomorrow
some people think about tomorrow and
then they have an extra thing to worry
about
i think about tomorrow
and i replace worry with
curiosity
here's another reframe by the way these
are also from my book i'm working on now
curiosity
curiosity is one of the most powerful
forces in human existence
we're designed to be curious because we
would die if we weren't like we need to
look into things all right what was that
noise is this a danger we have to be
curious you can't turn off curious
so if you've got something that worries
you tomorrow
try this reframe
i am so curious how this is going to
turn out
it's not going to kill me
most things are not going to kill you
right most things are just going to be
annoying or embarrassing or you waste
your time or you lose some money
whatever they don't kill you
so
re reframe your anxiety into curiosity
and here's the second way to do it
imagine it's your last day on earth
i just watched a joe rogan clip on
talking about you know
seeing his grandparent die and
reminding him he has a short time on
earth
so it made him more motivated to know
that life is limited
you can do that too
just say hey
i'm only here for so long
whatever comes after this if anything
it's not going to be this
so let's just see what happens
let's just see if i can play this game
this existence
i'll just play it like a video game i'll
just see what happens tomorrow what
would happen if i do this
i don't know
what would happen if i took that risk i
was always afraid of not a physical risk
but like a social risk or
let's say career risk what would happen
what would happen if i went up to that
person who's a and just
said you know
i've been putting up with you for so
long you're such a i
don't care who hears me say that
what would happen
what would happen are you curious
yeah if you feel that tomorrow is a big
problem
try to give you something yourself even
bigger problem
and you think that sounds like bad
advice but what i mean by a bigger
problem is something more interesting
just more interesting
make yourself curious
your curiosity will will start to
compete with your anxiety and it could
even pass it
if you play it like a game you're way
less interested in losing
if you play it like everything you do
tomorrow is the beginning
you know and the end of your death you
know it's like everything's life and
death it isn't
almost nothing is
almost everything can be redone or fixed
or corrected or whatever it kind of
doesn't matter if tomorrow doesn't work
out
because this is the day after right
so just get curious what would happen if
i do this
what would happen if i don't act the way
i always act
what would happen if i dress differently
what would happen
if i
made a system to go to the gym every day
what would happen if i asked out that
person that i thought was too good for
me
who knows
let's find out
get curious
i talked to somebody who had used the
following reframe here's one for you
imagine
imagine you go into a room for strangers
and you have to
meet people and make conversation
very scary for most of us right if you
don't have those skills very scary but
now suppose i told you
all right i'm going to hire you
i'm going to pay you very well you're
going to be really well paid to do this
i want you to go into that party of
strangers
and pretend
just pretend to have social skills
and just meet as many people as you can
and i'll even give you i'll give you a
bonus for how many people you meet
completely sober
now how many people would have a much
easier time doing it knowing it's not
for themselves they're just doing it as
a job
it doesn't even matter if anybody turns
you down well let's just you know i'll
just go to the next one it's just a job
you would you would take this thing that
like
scares you socially about your
embarrassment
and it would change it almost instantly
into just something you're doing
just something you're doing you you
would instantly change fear into
curiosity
all right i wonder if i can get that one
to talk to me
all right these guys these ones over
here look like you're in a group
watch me watch me go right into the
middle of that group
stop their conversation just see if i
can do it let's see what happens just
see what happens
now when you went home that night and
you thought about all the people who
sort of rejected you by not really being
open to your
your contacts the first thing you
noticed is there were there were almost
none of them
the thing you were afraid of was never
real
turns out people were happy to talk to
you
surprised people were just happy to talk
to you because they had the same problem
you did
they just wanted somebody to talk to
them so they didn't feel awkward
so
here are the reframes that help you the
most history doesn't exist
you can gamify
gamify your daily actions to take the
power out of the anxiety what if it's
just a game what if i just treat these
people like they're in my next practice
you know event i'm just practicing
and i heard from somebody yesterday who
tried that reframe and completely worked
and now somebody who can walk into a
crowded room and just start talking to
people
and all they do is just say well
i'll just gamify it see how many people
i can turn into a friend whatever
and it works
so these little reframes are insanely
powerful it just doesn't seem like they
would be and they require some
reinforcement
now i love looking at your comments when
you get quiet
in terms of
saying what i'm saying is either good or
bad
when you're telling me that what i'm
saying is either good or bad as i'm
saying it
i know i'm not having the same impact
because those are just your reflexive
responses
but when you get quiet
i know i'm hitting something
i'm definitely hitting something right
now
all right
feedback time
how many of you feel differently already
just right now how many of you feel
different
right now
on locals are a little faster and it's
mostly yes's
it's like a stream of yeses
youtube catching up
all yeses
yeah
now
this is not um
there are some numbers of course
but look how easy this was
right so that's what the upcoming book
will be it will be a number of reframes
so that
if you've got a specific problem
you could just go to that chapter and
say all right what's the reframe for
this
and then you just
reinforce it
and it's going to make a big difference
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is where we're
going to end today because i left you in
a good place
you've had two simultaneous sips lucky
lucky you
you've learned to release the history
because it doesn't exist you've learned
to gamify your current situation and
replace anxiety with curiosity
and you
are much better people than you were
15 minutes ago
way more capable
way more connected
way more
say
tool rich
you just gained three tools
that other people didn't have
we're going to close it on a closing
simultaneous sip
and then i'm going to let the youtube
people go
youtube thanks for joining spotify 2.
go
ah
well i know you're saying it's the best
ever live stream
but wait until tomorrow
oh my goodness tomorrow
aren't you curious about tomorrow
i'll see you later youtube
