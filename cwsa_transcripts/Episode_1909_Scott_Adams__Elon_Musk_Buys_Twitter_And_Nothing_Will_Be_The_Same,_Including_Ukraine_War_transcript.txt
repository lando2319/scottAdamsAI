foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to a highlight of civilization and one
of the most fun days that you'll ever
have on coffee with Scott Adams today
Neo has entered the Matrix
and I don't think anything's going to be
the same I don't know we'll find out
but would you like to take it up a notch
would you like to enjoy coffee in not
only this Dimension but higher
Dimensions as well well all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tank or
Chelsea style the canteen jogger flaska
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a double being here today
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sep and it
happens now go
um yeah freedom
freedom
well I was very proud of my tweet last
night
I tweeted the following everything you
can identify by its initials is working
for its own interests not yours no
exceptions
now how would you like a little
persuasion tip to cake off your morning
what was the persuasion part of this
tweet I'll read it again and you tell me
what is the persuasion part everything
you can identify by its initials is
working for its own interests not yours
no exceptions
yeah no exceptions
do you know me well enough to know
that of course I know there are
exceptions
don't you know I know there are
exceptions of course there are
exceptions of course there are
but but the fact that I make you think
about it is what is what binds you to
the tweet
so here's here's what I hoped you would
do yeah I'm seeing some exceptions like
AIDS
yeah that would be an exception
so what you were supposed to do is say
well this can't be true
Well it can't be true that everything
that you you can identify by its
initials is working for itself not you I
mean what about the FBI oh okay
all right but it can't be true of
everything I mean I take for example the
IRS
but okay well at least you've got the
GOP
oh okay
yeah and not all people
not all people I mean what about AOC
oh yeah
but surely not BLM oh yeah
[Laughter]
somebody said KFC somebody said most
somebody said every business
is identified by its letters on the
stock market to which I say that's my
point
that's my point not your point every
single company is working for itself
that's called capitalism so yes every
single company that's listed on the
exchange is working for itself that's
how it works even KFC
even IBM
all right so just so you know you can be
on the inside
of course I did not believe there were
no exceptions of course I did not
believe that
but it's funny
can you give me that did it work
how many of you spend extra time because
I said there were no exceptions
I'll bet you did yeah ESG right
all right so that's your persuasion tip
of the day
that would be the intentional error
persuasion trick
well I continue to watch CNN to see if
they are turning toward the middle
and I do see signs of it I do see signs
of it for example uh
we did see that even CNN people I saw
several of them questioned whether
fetterman should have given even done
the debate
I'm not sure they would have done that a
year ago
I feel like that that was you know
clearly a move to the center
and uh spur Cornish I think was the one
who said it directly you know maybe it
wasn't his time maybe maybe wait till
next time
yeah which which has nothing to do with
the disability
I think you can be
you know perfectly appropriate and still
say maybe
maybe next time was better for him
so
uh along that theme Chris salazu writes
for CNN and had been one of the most uh
prolific anti-trump opinion piece people
but here he is today he says erase a
little opinion piece it's just this weak
Little Penny piece that looks like he
dashed it off in 10 minutes
he says with less than two weeks left
before the November midterm elections
all signs are pointing to a strong
Republican showing that would result in
a switch of party control in the house
and possibly the Senate he goes that's
very good news for Donald Trump
and then I'm waiting for the twist you
know the part where okay now he's now
he's going to get him and he just goes
on to say that Trump will uh do what he
always does which is take credit
if if the if the midterms go Trump's way
do you think Trump will take credit
for the fact that a lot of people that
let's say The Observers didn't think had
a chance or at least die or might
actually win
yes now not only will Donald Trump
predictably
try to take credit but let me ask you
he deserves it right
right I would I wouldn't even I wouldn't
question it at one moment would you
if Trump took credit wouldn't you say
yeah that's that's warranted
because I believe that even the people
who are doing things sort of
independently from Trump
are still conforming to Trump
am I right
there's nobody who's out there
completely independent of trump if
they're a republican if you're a
republican you're running under a trump
set of parameters whether you say it out
loud or not you don't have to say it out
loud
yeah Trump would get complete credit for
this in my opinion I think that would be
completely Justified but here's the
surprising part
even Chris Elizabeth says that's true
yeah he says a little more indirectly
but he does say the Trump campaigned for
you know some of these semi-under-dogs
and that they might actually win
and that taking credit wouldn't be crazy
right I mean I'm adding that part but uh
yeah I do see I do see a genuine shift
toward the middle for CNN it continues
all right the big story you all want to
talk about is Elon Musk carried a sink
into Twitter headquarters yesterday
an actual kitchen sink
now and then he tweeted uh you know that
he was in the Twitter headquarters let
that sink in
now
was that the most brilliant thing that
anybody ever did
see you think that Elon Musk is mostly
smart with technology
that's what you think he knows how to
make money but you really miss that he
is understanding of persuasion
is as good as it gets it's as good as it
gets yeah he's in the using the elite
category of persuaders and this was a
perfect example
who else would have carried a sink into
Twitter headquarters
and and I spent a lot of time trying to
figure out why
right how many of you spent a lot of
time thinking about it and trying to
figure out why why exactly a sink
I actually still don't know oh is that
an old meme
it's an old meme
let that sink in
yeah but let that sink in
is that why he brought this ink just for
that one line
people are saying it's an old meme
well I I understand that everything but
the kitchen saying perhaps it I'm not
quite connecting it anyway it doesn't
matter
so here's the beauty
the beauty is that you all interpreted
it however you wanted to am I right
didn't you all simply put whatever
interpretation you wanted on that which
is perfect it's just perfect so what do
I teach you about
um
about persuasion here are two rules
the the Elon Musk is using number one
visual
visual persuasion beats everything so he
created a picture that could capture the
the concept because everybody was going
to talk about the concept of him buying
it today but there's no picture
of a person doing a contract to complete
a transaction
he actually created a visual
to to basically capture that story and
of course he guaranteed that that would
be on every every media Outlet
now here's the other so the first first
rule of persuasion is visual you have to
own the visual second part of persuasion
is surprise
surprise
so he had to do something that was
visual but visual in a surprising way
so he brings a sake
these are two of the you know probably a
few listed your top 10 rules of
persuasion these would be two of the ten
right when you see him persuading
he's doing it right like he's actually
using the the best technique of
persuasion this is not an accident he
knows how to do this
and uh I don't know where he learned it
but
but one one can speculate
all right so uh I tweeted uh Neo has
entered the Matrix
and
Neo has entered the Matrix
now I always tease people when they make
Matrix you know references because it's
such a stale reference but I'm going to
make an exception for myself
like everybody does everybody makes an
exception for themselves I'm going to
make an exception for myself because
it's too perfect
because he actually is entering
the you know not exactly the Matrix
but once he has access to the algorithm
he actually controls reality
he's not just controlling
a company
and he's not just controlling a you know
an important media Enterprise
it's way beyond that
he's controlling reality
Neo has entered the Matrix
he's literally I mean this is as close
to a literal as you can get I mean it's
not literally Neo but it's as close as
you can get
you know in our world
now
do you think this marks a turning point
or is it just going to be another
ownership of Twitter and he'll he'll do
some funny things and nothing will
change what do you think do you think
this changes everything
or change is nothing
I think it's going to change everything
maybe not right away
but faster than you think and I'll I'll
develop this a little bit now I saw I
saw somebody very smart
on on Twitter Brian rum maili I wish I
could pronounce his name
but he was speculating that this is just
the first part
and that Elon might have his eyes on
acquiring
uh Rumble
now I own stock and Rumble so full
disclosure I don't want to start a rumor
that benefits be financially in some
non-disclosed way right so I'm I've got
some stock and Rubble
um that I acquired because Rumble
acquired locals and I had a small
investment in the locals so I went over
to rumble
what do you think do you think Elon Musk
would buy Rumble
it feels like a natural doesn't it
it does actually feel like a natural
extension but it feels like you know who
knows so I'm not going to predict that
but I'll note that somebody else has
predicted it somebody smart
um
question number one
what would happen just hypothetically
if uh Twitter ends up changing the
algorithm
such that Democrats see real news for
the first time
what would happen
I mean seriously what would happen if
Democrats saw a real news for the first
time
what will that do because I'm here to
tell you that there's a mental health
element to this that is under
appreciated
have any of you ever had the experience
of thinking something was true let's say
about your own life
only to learn that what you thought was
always true or had been true for a long
time was completely undrew
I'll give you an example suppose you
worked for Enron
and you'd worked for Enron for years and
then later you found out the Enron
wasn't even a real company
it was basically a whole sham
like what would that do to your mental
health
um
I I know a woman I won't name names but
somebody I knew somebody I just don't
know obviously still know her and she
had been with a guy for years and years
and they were very close
didn't feel like getting married
necessarily but it looked like it was
heading that way
and one day
her boyfriend had some major health
problems
so the boyfriend goes in the hospital
and she visits him in the hospital
and there's another woman in there
visiting her boyfriend in the hospital
and they see each other they go hi I see
you're visiting the same person
uh what are you here for
and she goes oh I'm his wife
and she goes what are you here for and
she said
I'm his girlfriend of five years
and they learned for the first time he
had two lives two complete lives
now what happened to her Mental Health
when she found out the last five years
of her life were not what she thought
wasn't easy
it wasn't easy like it was really
disorienting I mean you could imagine
what that would do to you your whole
life
your whole life would be altered by that
because everything you saw would be I
don't know if I can trust that what
would you ever trust you would never
trust anything again right
um
so one possibility of Elon buying
Twitter is that Democrats will see real
news for the first time
also
people on the right will see things from
the left that they've never seen before
what will that do to people will that
bring us together or make us crazy
because I think the initial impact will
be to make us disoriented
what happens when when people get
disoriented
go back to your persuasion lessons
if everybody gets disoriented and they
they can't find their base anymore
like their team doesn't make sense
they're not sure which team they're on
now what happens
when people are disoriented
they don't thrive in chaos no that's not
what happens
uh cognitive distance Maybe cognitive
dissonance may give them some Escape
but there's something scarier
the scarier is thing is that when nobody
has anything to latch onto the first
person who provides that thing to latch
onto they'll latch onto it so in other
words they'll be looking for a new truth
whoever provides the new truth
owns them
right they'll be broken they'll be
broken free from their old truth and
floating free and they're free agents
somebody's gonna somebody's gonna suck
them into their team
you hoping somebody good
right you're hoping somebody who has
some principles and not somebody evil
but somebody's going to do it a lot of
free agents will be created by this I
think
now that assumes that the algorithm
changes in some dramatic way but which
might not happen we don't know
what would happen if Elon Musk finds out
that
Twitter was actually let's say being
influenced by
foreign forces and and everything was
corrupt
well he tracks that I mean that would be
step number one but things could look
real different
because we don't know
so you want to hear a good example of
some fake news today
Wall Street Journal had some excellent
fake news
and I don't really blame the The Wall
Street Journal of fake news often do I
in fact I don't know if I've name
checked them before for fake news
so this will be the first time probably
all right so the Wall Street Journal had
an article that China is considering
interfering in our elections
I don't know if that's true or false but
probably true
and it reports that they they may have
changed their mind about interfering in
the 2016 election
or was it 2020 but they haven't
interfered recently because they didn't
have a preference of who was president
so then they didn't think that their
interests would be served by either
president so they didn't interfere
but now the the thought is that they
might interfere
and they would interfere in a general
mucking up Society way as opposed to
picking a winner so they try to sow
Civil War and you know and make us doubt
the elections and stuff now that part
I'm willing to believe is all correct
reporting by The Wall Street Journal I I
wouldn't know one way or the other
but here's what they here's what they
said next
that uh
that that China have not risen to the
level of Russia and they said also Iran
in interfering with their elections
as Russia and Iran have alleged to have
done
do you see the fake news
Russia interfered with our election now
specifically they were talking about
um Bots and fake fake users so here I'm
not talking about hacking emails so
nothing about hacking emails or steel
dossey or anything like that I'm only
talking about trolls where you're
sending social media trolls now do you
think that Russia influenced our
elections in the past with their trolls
what's the news say the news says yes
right
the new says they tried to uh influence
now is that real news or fake news is it
real or fake news that Russia tried to
interfere with our elections with Bots
is real fake news
is real and it's also fake it's real
that it happened
I think everybody agrees that it
happened
how big was it
was a it was like a hundred thousand
dollar ad spend
for some memes that we got to see
eventually and the memes had no power
whatsoever
I can tell you as somebody who has
studied persuasion they didn't have any
persuasive power they were just random
jokes no persuasion whatsoever so do you
think the Wall Street Journal gave you a
straight report by saying that China you
know might try to get up to the level of
interference of Russia or should they
have said
nobody has done anything of of substance
yet
they might
but even Russia has not done anything of
substance yet they did a real thing it
just didn't make any difference and
couldn't have at that at that size
now correct me if I'm wrong that's fake
news right it's fake news to suggest
that Russia had an impact
with the Bots that's completely fake
news
so all right
um
Elon
musk tweeted that citizen journalism is
one of the you know big benefits he said
a beautiful thing about Twitter is how
it empowers citizen journalism people
are able to dissemitate news without an
establishment bias which of course
caused critics to stream in and say but
those citizens will not be fact checked
now does that sound like the dumbest
criticism you've ever heard in 2022 let
me say it again just so you can laugh at
it I will now be the critic you can't
have citizen journalism because who
would do the fact checking
all right you can stop laughing there's
no fact checking now who believes
there's any fact checking on the actual
professional news
the fact checking is clearly fake
is obviously fake it's like Way Beyond
the level where it's a conspiracy theory
that is fake it's obviously demonstrably
factually proven to be fake
how could citizen journalism be worse
than that
it couldn't possibly be worse could it
yeah in a sense every tweet is fact
checked in real time by by the rest of
the comments you're right
all right here's some more fake news
that's real news
fake news fake news this real news
uh you remember PayPal said that they
were going to find people twenty five
hundred dollars for disseminating for
spreading misinformation
and then the world the world uh rebelled
and said no you can't do that we'll
close our accounts and then PayPal uh
they uh they backpedaled and they said
oh oh that was just a mistake that
wasn't even supposed to be in there
total mistake we took that out it was
like a typo it's almost like it never
happened
and then after you were no longer paying
attention
they published their their new terms of
service and the 2500 fine is according
to Twitter users not to Twitter but
users on Twitter they put that twenty
five hundred dollar back in there as
soon as the outcry died down
is that true news or fake news go
True News or fake news that PayPal put
the twenty five hundred dollars back in
there after they said they'd take it out
it is fake news but also kind of true
here's what's fake
they did take out the spreading
misinformation part
so the 2500 part apparently was always
in there but it was related to um
to other bad behavior so for example if
you were using their service to promote
I know Hitler or racism or something you
could have been you know dinged for
twenty five hundred dollars so the
twenty five hundred dollars is still
there but it was there always and it
wasn't related to spreading
misinformation
so the misinformation part they got rid
of
or did they
or did they
let's go a little bit deeper
so first of all it's fake news
because they didn't put in the the
spreading misinformation part
visit
because let's look at what part they did
leave in
so they do not have spreading
misinformation that's one of the
triggers for the 2500 fee but here are
some things that I think these have been
in there before
I think but they're in there now
so one of the things that you can't do
is uh
collect money for products that
represent a risk to Consumer safety
so you can't be doing something that
would uh
present a risk to Consumer safety
so what would be some things
there would be a risk to Consumer safety
firearms
Firearms would be a risk to Consumer
safety how about how about Ivermectin
is Ivermectin a product
that in somebody else's opinion could be
a risk to Consumer safety
well I could I could interpret it that
way
because even if somebody said well I've
remected as well tolerated
then could not PayPal say it doesn't
matter that it's well tolerated if
you're promoting this you're sort of
anti-vaccine and that's misinformation
or or that's harmful not misinformation
it's harmful
so don't they still have a way to say
that you're doing stuff that's harmful
related to a product
does that give them any I mean I'm not a
lawyer so I'm just speculating here I
don't know
um
about uh this one
uh yeah how about uh tick tock
do you think Tick Tock is a product that
presents a risk to Consumer safety
if you collected money for something on
Tick Tock I don't know if that's a thing
or not but could you collect money well
here's a story about Tick Tock
apparently Tick Tock was spreading
around something called a Blackout
Challenge in which children were
encouraged to straggle themselves
I'm not making that up
so the algorithm of tick tock delivered
to a 10 year old girl so it decided that
she would be interested in seeing this a
challenge to strangle herself at which
he did and then she died allegedly
now this story does have a little bit
too much a little bit too on the nose so
if tomorrow you find out this is fake
news don't be surprised this has fake
news read all over it but it also could
be true which would be a huge tragedy
but whether or not this one well
incident is true
clearly Tick Tock is spreading you know
information that somebody could say was
dangerous somebody could
so we're in murky territory if uh
products that are risk to Consumer
safety are a trigger for you know
getting in trouble
um
how about this you could also get in
trouble according to PayPal if you're
collecting money for sale of products
and services identified by government
agencies to have a high likelihood of
being fraudulent
so if you sold Ivermectin
for covid
then government agencies would say that
has a high high risk of being fraudulent
right wouldn't that example fit that
so they do have some some questionable
elements in that terms of service but
we'll see how that works out
um
let's see
more on AI because as much as you hate
talking about AI it's the only thing
that's going to matter in about three
years and you really need to be ready
you would be mad at me if I didn't warn
you about this right
um
do you remember that it wasn't long ago
when uh people who thought they were
smart
said well AI might take some of your
factory jobs but the last thing AI will
be able to do is art
do you remember when all the smart
people thought AI couldn't do art
and do you remember when I kept saying
uh you are so wrong
no no art will be the first thing it can
do why because art has patterns and
rules
that the artists know but you don't
so the reason that art looks you know
magical to people who can't do it is
that they don't know it's just based on
rules and if they knew the rules maybe
they couldn't be as good as the great
artists they could come close
for example I discovered that humor as a
formula
and I believe I'm the only person who's
ever written about it but there are six
dimensions of humor you've got to use at
least two NSX to make it a joke
could I teach AI to write a joke yes I
could then all I would need to do is
rapidly test his jokes against real
people
until I had the best form of it
it made my need to test you know a
thousand different varieties
but one of those thousand would be
better than a human could do
it's already there
right it's just a trivial a trivial uh
iteration until it can do humor and
singing it'll do music it already does
graphic art better than actual artists
in my opinion now what it doesn't do yet
is follow
the boss's specifications as well as a
human might but that's you know that'll
happen
so uh here's an example of how this is
going to mess up every industry I
believe every industry is going to be
turned upside down in three years or
less
so Shutterstock a company that sells uh
photographs or license them so you can
use them in your own your own content
but it had a problem because people were
putting computer generated art on their
site
and the computer generated art would
borrow from living artists and create a
composite and so the living artists were
saying hey
that's actually my art
that are just stole and combined with
somebody else's you can't do that
and so Shutterstock is coming up with an
idea
in which they would compensate the
original artists
from which the AI borrowed
I don't see how that can work do you
because how do you know what the AI
borrowed from
I I just doesn't seem workable at all
but they'll try to do it now let me give
you a secret
to how to destroy a business model are
you ready
so my business model is I'm a syndicated
cartoonist so if if Dilbert does really
well I get a lot of benefit
but if another cartoonist who is also
syndicated doesn't do well very few
newspapers buy it for example then they
make a small income and I make a bigger
income because Dilbert does well
well do you know what the newspapers
want us to do us the syndication
they want to combine all Comics as one
thing
and then just charge One price
and then the cartoonists would sort of
get an equal share because everybody's
cartoon is being contributed to this
product
do you know what that does to me
puts me out of business
because I would never if that business
model becomes the dominant one and it
will it will then I can't make money
right it would basically it would lower
my income which is very worthwhile down
to a level that is not worthwhile and
then I would find something else to do
that could pay better because cartoony
wouldn't pay
that's what's going to happen with these
photographers
so you start with you know the best
photographers who can make insanely good
pictures and they're really the stars
and their stuff gets at least more those
people will no longer be in that
business
because AI will make it unprofitable
so the best of the best humans will
retire immediately
because they won't have a business model
so whenever you're doing something like
combining people's art
you've destroyed the art industry
you got that true with music as well you
know how music streaming the uh it was
terrible for the most important artists
but it was probably good for the the
Lesser artists
okay so everything is going in the
direction the artist will be out of
business if they're the the star artists
now you might not care
unless you're a star artist like I am
which is weird to call myself that but
it's true
I think at the moment
I'm not sure this is true but I think
I'm the most successful uh living
cartoonist who still has a cartoon
that's published
for adults
I think Garfield's bigger but that's
more oriented toward kids
I think that's true I think I just
outlived I outlived artists who are
better
um
so here again the uh let's talk about
Ukraine the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters you all remember that
years ago I came up with this idea that
the humans
um reliably solve any problem they can
see coming from a long ways away
if it's a really bad problem they can
still solve it if they have time like
the year 2000 problem like running out
of uh oil in the 70s just you know all
kinds of problems running out of food we
sold it Etc so if you have time
we're fine
and
here's another example of that as of
today CNN is reporting that Germany who
who had been importing 55 percent of its
gas from Russia before the war
55 of all of Germany's gas
uh you know
not Casper I think they mean gas for uh
Heating
um
they've already replaced it yeah LNG
they've already fully replaced it
Germany already has enough gas for the
whole winter
because they knew they knew they had
time
now if you told me that that was
possible I would have doubted it out
actually I would have doubted my own
my own law of slow living disasters
because I couldn't imagine that they
would build storage facilities or that
they had storage facilities that would
effectively double their capacity and
they were just sitting there empty
I mean how exactly do you store it
or is it stored maybe on site somewhere
else but they own it oh you know I'll
bet that's it I'll bet that's it it's
not stored in country
that's it they own it but it's probably
still with the producer right yeah the
producer still owns it the producer
holds it but they own it that's got to
be it
um but anyway they worked it out now
Ukraine of course has a bigger problem I
and I didn't see any note about the
other European countries because maybe
they had less exposure to Russia
specifically but if the other European
countries are in as good a shape
then Europe is going to get through the
winter it's just going to be really
expensive
um and that would take away Putin's
biggest weapon wouldn't it
so Putin's biggest remaining weapons are
nuclear weapons
and um freezing Europe
it looks like he's not going to get away
with Frieza Europe and even Ukraine I
think is going to you know survive
it'll be difficult but they will
um oh Italy is upping Drilling in the
Adriatic Sea somebody's reporting here
citizen reporting there you go
um
so here's the next thing that's
happening
what happens when so Putin I get well
Russia has threatened
um
to shoot down uh Elon Musk satellites
what do you think of that
so Putin in Russia
actually threatened that they might take
out with satellites if the satellites
are you know helping Ukraine now
let me uh
let me just put this out there
I've told you that AI will be able to do
you know better than humans the other
thing that AI will do better than humans
is persuade
it will be persuasive way more precise
persuasive than humans because you could
just feed AI the 10 rules of persuasion
and they would just use them I could
tell you the 10 rules of persuasion all
day long and you'll still forget to use
them
right but an AI we'll just use them
correctly it will also instantly test
to see which things get more retweets
so AI
could in theory very quickly be so
powerful as a persuasion it would be a
weapon of mass destruction
not a joke I hate to quote Biden my God
I just quoted Biden
that literally with no exaggeration no
hyperbole persuasion once it's
weaponized by AI who will be so powerful
that it could cause a revolution it
could take down the country it could
turn off your power
it could kill everybody
so
so do you know who has access to a
weapon of mass destruction of that that
size
probably Elon Musk
now I think he I think he's no longer
involved with one of the big AIS that
Sam Altman was was backing I think they
were together at one point I read
something that said he might not be
involved with AI now
but that's not Joe he's doing AI with
Tesla right yeah he must have ai access
in a variety of ways so so imagine
imagine this imagine Putin targeting
Elon Musk satellites hypothetically
and then imagine the Elon Musk getting
pissed off
and deciding to Target Putin
with AI persuasion
do you think that Elon Musk could take
down Russia or take down Putin
specifically with nothing but AI
persuasion
what do you think
do you believe that Elon Musk would at
first of all access to it you'd have to
have access
he'd have to have Twitter supporting it
and not Banning it
so he has a platform he has the AI and
he would have the motive hypothetically
so if his satellites get targeted
Elon Musk has the power of a
nation-state
just about as soon as he has Twitter
right because he will have the platform
he'll have the distribution the
satellites and he'll have the AI
to weaponize it in whatever way you want
it if if his ethical let's say if his
ethical constraints allowed him to do
that
right he might just say he'd never use
it for war he you might have an ethical
constraint about weaponizing AI which
would be reasonable actually
right so I would worry if I were Putin
because Putin can attack Ukraine and he
might survive
but if he attacks Elon Musk satellites
I don't think he has a chance
I don't think he has a chance
I think Elon would take him out and he
would never know
right Putin would just know that things
went bad you wouldn't know why
because the the persuasion would be
somewhat you know under the hood he
wouldn't even see it happening
anyway
um
the other thing is that if you're if
you're a gazillionaire
you can just bribe the highest people in
the Russian government to do anything
you want okay oh here's a question for
you
now uh it is illegal for an American to
bribe
a foreigner or bribe anybody right isn't
it illegal to bribe in every situation
is that true
yes or no
it's it's illegal in every situation
right does that include War
is it illegal to bribe somebody in the
context of War
of course not in the context of War you
can bribe somebody to be your spy
right now I don't know if an American
citizen can participate on their own in
a war
can they
would that even be illegal I don't know
like suppose let me give you for example
let's say we're at War and I send a
tweet out that I think is really
persuasive and could make a difference
am I am I joining the war without
permission
did I just what if I just like grab some
weapons and fly over there on my own and
start shooting bad guys is that legal
you know if I'm shooting the enemy
is it illegal to do that if I'm an
American citizen I suppose I only killed
actually combatants I didn't kill any
citizens
would that be illegal
I'm assuming it is right I'm assuming
this
but I suppose Elon Musk went to uh our
military and said
I know I wouldn't normally do this
but I know a bunch of high-level
Russians because I do business over
there and I can guarantee you that I
could tell some of those high-ranking
Russians that if they get rid of Putin
they've got a good job with me on SpaceX
someday
could he do that
would would the American Military say
sure I mean if you can make it happen go
ahead
would they give them the the yes because
you know no money has to change hands
all it would require is one conversation
through intermediaries
hey uh hey uh Igor
uh Elon told me to tell you
that if you turn on Putin in some
specific way let's say uh you've got a
job at SpaceX
I feel like I feel like going after
Ukraine is a real dangerous thing and
Putin took a big risk but going after
Elon Musk would be another level of
danger that I don't I don't think he
would take off
because you wouldn't see it coming
right you would you wouldn't know
what Elon Musk did back
that you you would just know something
bad happened
all right
um
so
the U.S uh apparently Anthony blinken
says he's reiterated
that the U.S is tracking the kremlin's
nuclear saber rattling and
um and has Warren Putin not to use
nuclear weapons and he and I guess Putin
knows what the uh the response would be
and it would be a terrible response
something terrible
now let me ask you this
I don't want to get into you know a
definition or
but is it really a war if you can tell
the other side what weapons to use
like there's something weird about this
am I wrong if you can tell your enemy
who's trying to kill you
if you could tell them what what weapons
they can and cannot use
is it really a war
I would say it's a negotiation
it's a war when you use all your weapons
when you when you hold back your best
weapons
I think that's just a negotiation
that happens to evolve bullets
right yeah chemical and nuclear being
held back yeah so to me this looks like
an active negotiation
if somebody wanted to win a war
they'd use all their weapons
that's what I think
so it's partly economic so we can sell
military weapons I'm sure uh and partly
just a you know extended negotiation
I mean all war is negotiation people say
that
all right
um do you believe that somewhere in the
world an AI is already being trained in
the skill of persuasion
what do you think
well if it's not
that would be an obvious oversight
yeah it's already happened of course
and her name is Trinity yes
um was a cold war a negotiation or a war
well it wasn't a war
it was it was a bunch of is
what it was
you know I still maintained that the
reason for the Ukraine war is not any
reason that's been mentioned
do you do you want to know my reason for
the Ukraine war
do you remember what it was let's see if
you can remember
so my reason for the Ukraine war is not
no not this not Hunters laptop
not about money not about money
laundering not about lithium
not about the world economic Forum not
about lithium not about money not about
resources
uh not about ego not about NATO
expansion
right you know what I think it was the
root root root cause you ready
not about regime change not about land
not about military
nope
it's simpler than that
there are too many Russian experts in
our government
that's it
there are too many Russian experts in
our government
and let me let me really up your
mind here
here's a mental challenge
imagine if the number of Russian experts
in their government
um let's say that that all changed and
that was a small number and the number
of uh
let's say
Iranian experts in our government was
expanded to the number of Russian
experts
do you think we would be starting a war
with Iran if most of our experts were
Iranian experts
yes we would
right you're going to start a war with
whoever you have the most experts with
why because there will be the most
number of voices telling you you need a
war so that those experts are more
important
follow the money right if you follow the
money it goes all the way down to how
many experts are on each team
that if there were if we only had one
Russian expert
who was really good
just just one person but they're really
good and everybody knew they were really
good do you think that one expert could
start a war
no because just one person
but as soon as you got like Russia
experts all through your organizations
they're going to be looking for war with
Russia because that's what makes them
important it's good for their income
good for their careers good for their
Prestige good for everything so of
course there's going to be War if you
have a lot of Russian experts
so all of those other reasons above that
those are all fake
they're all fake because you could
recreate this situation just well you
could predict it just by the number of
experts that's all it would take
right yeah the people who are who only
have a hammer
think everything looks like an ale
because aren't you confused about the
fact that the United States and the
Russia have any beef whatsoever
doesn't it make no sense it doesn't make
any sense
that I I will say it until I'm blue in
the face and it will definitely happen
it goes like this Russia and the United
States are natural allies
you can't stop that Arc of history from
happening
there's nothing that will stop us from
being allies in the long run it will
happen we just have too much of God
and and a a distrust of China is at the
top of the list
right
so
um
I suspect
that the way we solve Ukraine is by
bringing space and a future a future
where we can work together into the mix
now do you think the United States could
ever propose
that we work together with Russia
no because there are too many Rush
experts I
the only way that would work is if you
found a way to monetize the Russia
experts for helping to bring Russia into
I don't know NATO or an alliance or
whatever if the Russia experts could
find a way to make money from
non-conflict
then it could work but I don't know how
that would work nobody makes money from
non-conflict
that's an exaggeration
all right
I believe that is uh all I wanted to
talk about right now
um for those of you who are not members
of the locals subscription forum
I'm going to start putting Dilbert
comics in the locals Network because
since since that Community I manage I
can do that legally
so if anybody who wants to see Dilbert
automatically
that'll be
that's one way to do it uh also be
increasing my robots renews Comics that
I've let lapse for a little bit so the
the edgiest comments Comics you'll ever
see
will be in locals because I can't get
canceled for that stuff
all right
uh you haven't emailed okay
yeah you know the the locals the local
subscription Network would replace my
entire syndication company
because in theory I'm not doing this but
in theory I could just say to any
newspaper or entity that wanted to run
Dilbert I could just say yes all you
need is a five dollar a month
subscription if you buy an annual
subscription it's five dollars a month
and for five dollars a month you can run
Dilbert anywhere you want just put it
into your newspaper and they could just
go get it they just screen grab it or
whatever they need to do
or download it
all right
um I have a question for you I need to
use the
uh the collective mind
so I've done this experiment before but
every time I do it I'm fascinated and
I'm going to ask something that's you
know purely from my own benefit but
maybe helps you too
here's a question
if you use a blood pressure monitor the
kind that wraps around your arm and then
compresses your arm
if you sit in one place and just measure
your blood pressure three times in a row
will it always be lower on the third try
and and is that because you've been
sitting there or is it because the
machine squeezed you once or twice and
so it's getting a different reading the
third time in other words is the third
reading accurate if you keep the band on
do you have to take the band off and put
it back on
each time you use it or can you just sit
there and hit yes every time
all right I'm saying your answers are
all over the place
all right here's here's why I want to
know
all right because I did something
yesterday that blew my mind
right now a number of times I've done
multiple readings on on my blood
pressure monitor
and generally they're they're not too
far like each reading is you know within
the range of the other one you know
they're different every time you do it
but they're not that different you can
tell if you have high blood pressure or
not right but here's something I did
yesterday I took it three times
first time
134 over
90 something
so that's high
second time
similar like 132 over High East or
something like that all right
third time
I used a mental exercise
and all I did was drop myself on a beach
in Hawaii a beach that I know well
enough that I can imagine it in in
perfect detail
dropped myself on the beach and then
took the blood pressure monitor right so
here here it went from 134 over 90.
and in
30 seconds of visualization
I lowered it to 118 over 68.
118 over 68. that's low blood pressure
that's below normal
in 30 seconds
now now here don't don't take this as
impressive that's not where I'm going
with this I'm not saying that really
worked I'm asking you if it really
worked I'm not claiming it I'm not
claiming it worked I'm asking you if I
fooled myself because because the cuff
was just looser on the third try
now I will I'll try to recreate it
you were taught to do a biopsychologist
now here's what you need to know yeah as
you know I'm a trained hypnotist and I
can do self-hypnosis it's one of the
things that I learned you know learning
hypnosis and self-hypnosis is sort of a
rapid meditation
so you can bring yourself to a desired
state
but where meditation it's sort of you
know you work your way toward it and
you're never sure you're there and
everything else but without hypnosis you
can go right to it
so when I say I drop myself in a beach
I mean I could feel my entire metabolism
feel the exact way I would feel if I
were on the beach in the Sun
and I did it in 30 seconds
and I could feel the entire Beach
feeling like I could feel it on my skin
now I also have an unusual
let's say an unusually commercially
developed imagination
do you ever wonder you know the famous
question do you see red the same way I
see red you know there's no way to know
but there's also no way to know although
there was a test that claims that we do
see it the same but I don't believe it
um
there's also no way to know if everybody
imagines the same way
right because I can't see your
imagination and you can't see mine but I
believe the evidence suggests that
because I'm a professional creative
person I probably have a stronger power
of imagination
because I make money on my imagination
and I use it every day so just
oh Carpe Duncan
hey everybody say hi to Carpe Duncan who
says to us from YouTube see you soon
that is the best message I got all day
see you soon
absolutely
absolutely
all right
um so the question is do I have better
powers of imagination is that why maybe
I could imagine my blood pressure down
um or was it just a trick on me so I'll
test it again but I wondered if anybody
knew the answer to that all right that's
all for now
and
uh everything is a bell curve okay
uh yes we talked about Georgia Milani on
different live stream
all right
um
Carpe make sure that you uh tweet me as
soon as you run on Twitter and we'll
we'll get your numbers up
we'll get you up to a million users and
uh
in about six months
all right that's all for now YouTube Dr
