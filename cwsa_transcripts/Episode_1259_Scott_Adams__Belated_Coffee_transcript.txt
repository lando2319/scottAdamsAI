well
let's see if this works i'm deeply
skeptical
coming to you from the other side of the
planet well
might be on the same side of the planet
as you but probably not
so uh come on in here we've got stuff to
talk about assuming this works
who knows if i've got enough wi-fi here
to get a
all the way across the world but i feel
like i do
so would you like to
see a little bit of where i'm at as soon
as we get a few more people i'll show
you that
so let's talk about joe biden
um the bad news is he seems to be very
much a
america last kind of a president
now is that always a bad idea
because trump sold us on america first
being a good idea so when is it a bad
idea
to put yourself first and when is it a
good idea
let me give you some examples some
context
when world war ii ended the united
states
was unusually generous i think you could
say due
to the defeated powers germany and japan
and i don't know that we were
necessarily putting america first
then except in the long term
now did it work in the long run to put
america let's say a little bit
disadvantaged if we're giving any money
to other countries
and the answer is it did work in fact
germany and japan
are two of our best allies and uh
i would say it's one of the most
successful things ever done in the
history of the planet
so there are cases um you know obvious
cases
where putting other countries first
could work out great but did that work
out with china
because i feel like it's not that you
should put others first
or you should put yourself first i feel
like every situation might be a little
different
so china being maybe a little more
aggressive about its role in the world
maybe you can't put them first because
they're putting themselves first
but let's say the vietnam war is over
and eventually
vietnam and the united states want to
make friends
i don't know that we've done anything
that would be called putting vietnam
ahead of ourselves but it certainly made
sense to be friends
and i think that'll work out in the long
run so i think it depends on the country
so let's take a look at some of those
other not america first
things that uh biden did see how they
how they stack up compared to these
historical examples so you got
um i'll do this up in a minute
actually you probably want me to do that
now and i will
so sorry i missed you this morning
it was quite a nightmare in the hotel
experience of trying to find the lights
and whatnot i'll tell you about that
later but for now let's enjoy the
simultaneous sip because i know you're
addicted i know you need it
you could play this back in the morning
if i don't make it for tomorrow's uh
appointed time it's called the
simultaneous sip and all you need is a
couple more glasses a
tanker jealous or stein
canteen joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
don't mean the end of the day thing
makes everything better
except this vacation because i don't
think this could get better actually
it's called the simultaneous happens now
go
that's what you wanted was worth waiting
for
totally worth waiting for all right like
i was saying so biden's done a few other
miracle last things let's say the
paris climate uh accord
that feels like a miracle last but does
it
make sense in other words is our
involvement in it
somehow going to let's say that make the
world better for everyone
including america well that's the idea
right now if
the climate accords did anything like
that
probably be a pretty good idea but
it feels as though it doesn't do
anything like that
if you actually look at the agreement it
just seems good for china bad for
america
and that's the end of it that's it
that's the beginning and the end of the
story
good good for them bad for us and it's
written that way
it's written intentionally that way
because the
idea is that china needed a little extra
extra flexibility because it would take
much longer
to become green
is that a good idea or a bad idea well
if it's a good idea
it tells you that somehow
somehow that works out but it's hard for
me to imagine the scenario
where anything is different because of
it except that we're disadvantaged
i it's hard for me to i i'd like to hear
somebody explain the story
of how doing the climate accords leads
in a in a logical
connected way to a better world
easily you could have made that argument
with let's say the the marshall plan and
germany and
helping out japan after world war ii
it's an easy
it's an easy story you say well if we're
good to them and we will rebuild their
country
we'll be allies and that'll be good
forever and it worked
but if you can't do that with the paris
climate accord you know a logical
easy story that says oh yeah you do this
and we're hoping that this happens and
then this will happen
sort of logically flowing but i'll
really see it
it doesn't mean it's not there maybe it
just takes a better
explanation than what i've heard so far
um let's say the other the other things
that
that biden is doing that are not
give me some other examples or a few
other things he's doing that don't look
like they're
america first ending the uh
the pipeline so the first thing biden is
doing is screwing canada
he's screwing canada by cancelling the
pipeline after they put a whole bunch of
money and work
into it for years uh now i suppose you
could make an argument
uh that the environmentalists would that
it's good for america
but i just don't see it you know the the
pipeline is one of those things where if
everything went wrong it would be pretty
bad
but that's true of everything isn't it
couldn't you say that to the hoover dam
oh don't build that hoover dam because
if that thing breaks
that's gonna be bad it feels like
any big project you could make some kind
of an argument that if you did it wrong
bad stuff would happen that feels
generally true
all right um then
what was the other stuff that uh biden
did today oh
i think you signed something about uh
transgender
bathrooms and sports you got that going
uh basically just reversing everything
everything that trump did
i don't know how much of the i mean this
is going to affect me
i don't know if you've had that thought
there's a whole bunch of stuff that
i kind of prefer to be different you
know i kind of
i mapped pretty closely but not exactly
to a lot of the
trump policies but they don't actually
affect me that much
you know i'm not playing any sports in
high school
i don't think the the the climate will
be any different with or without the
accord i don't personally gain anything
from the pipeline that would be obvious
i mean
maybe it would affect uh energy costs at
some point
so it was really hard to it's hard to
get excited about any of this stuff it
all seems
small but let me give biden
one objective compliment
if i understand the topic right and it
goes like this
you you heard me complaining about the
trump administration not approving these
rapid tests that are less sensitive but
they can
they can find the um the strong cases
and given that we know that most of the
spreading happens from people have a
high
viral load in their nose and mouth that
that study just came out today so it
seems to be confirmed
that the super spreaders literally have
more of the virus
in the in the mask of their face uh
mask being a different word than an
actual mask mask meaning your your sort
of nose mouth area
and uh
so if it's true that the real problem is
the people who have a ton of virus
in them then it's also true that the
less sensitive tests
would get all of the super spreaders so
nobody would argue that the less
sensitive tests
would miss the super spreaders they
would only argue that it would miss the
marginal cases
but maybe you only need to get the super
spreaders because they're the ones doing
the damage
so biden has signed some kind of
executive order
that promotes that
that approach now i've been complaining
that this might be the most important
thing
maybe even more than the vaccinations in
terms of how important they are but
but at least you know equivalent to
vaccinations
if not more now again this assumes that
the tests work and they can be
they could be made in quantity and all
these other things
but biden just signed an order that i've
been complaining that
trump has ignored he's ignored the topic
or he did
he didn't say yes he didn't say no he
just acted like it didn't exist
i don't know why so if biden has done
this one thing
and it's right that looks like it might
be
you know too early to tell but it looks
like it might be right going to give him
full credit
now that doesn't mean that everything
else he does is right
but you know i'm not gonna i'm not going
to uh
you know disavow biden for doing
something i've been asking for for six
months
so that part's good the uh
there's also a question that jack
bosovic was asking i saw on twitter
he said is joe biden still putting kids
in cages
now of course the topic is not funny
uh yes it's deadly serious but the
but watching how biden deals with the
fact
that the only reason anybody was ever in
one of those containers which you would
call the cage
the only reason anybody was in it is
that nobody had a better idea
right if anybody had a better idea
i think we would have used it and the
argument which you probably never heard
uh biden won a majority of votes you are
dumb
so commenter says well let me
let me i gotta address that
so commenter
i've said there are two categories of
unambiguously stupid people
when it comes to the election and any
any claims of impropriety
the two stupid types of people are
people who are 100
sure it was fraudulent and enough
fraudulent that it changed the election
and the people who are 100 sure it
wasn't
those positions are stupid they're just
stupid
and honestly there's no way i can soften
that
because you don't know you don't know
the only thing you know is that people
looked in some small places and didn't
find anything
that would change the election result
that's it
that's all you know it's a fairly
non-transparent system
and even if it were transparent did you
look at it
how much time did you do counting
ballots
and recounting and auditing and looking
at the software
what did you do nothing so even if
other people had done the things that
need to be done which they can't because
the system doesn't allow that level of
transparency
you can do recounts and audits and
that's great but it doesn't get all the
things that could be done
if somebody wanted to you know fix an
election
so the only thing you can know for sure
is that
you either have a suspicion hmm that
looks
suspicious and so therefore i think
maybe there's a chance of something
wrong
but that's just a guess because there
are reasons that anomalies happen
probably every election some anomalies
are out there there might have been more
this time because
it was hard to predict and it was a
special election and trump was in it and
you know everything was different about
this election
so if you're sure in either direction
you're just stupid
and there's no way to soften that it's a
probability thing
certainty is just wrong answer
unless you're looking into it yourself
and you're not all right
so uh what was i saying about biden uh
the other thing biden did somebody'll
have to remind me
somebody says if you don't believe the
election was rigged you're not paying
attention
well you can believe anything you want
right belief
not really the right approach
because how would you like the jury to
do that
if you were on trial uh jury we've got
some
i don't know there are indications i
feel like in my gut
sort of a hunch i believe you're guilty
not really a good standard and i don't
think it would be a good standard for
you know major world decisions either
i just believe i feel like i got this
gut feeling
got this gut feeling but having mocked
it
let me agree with you that i have that
gut feeling
if you ask me to make a decision with my
body
and by every bias that i've ever
developed in my life
if that was the way i made decisions i
would say
i'll just go with my gut instinct it
doesn't feel right
so everybody here who says scott just
look at it
it doesn't feel right i i feel the same
thing you do
it doesn't feel like it was possible
but in the real world things happen
every single day that didn't look
possible
so if your standard is how you feel
that's not really how you make decisions
so
i would say be open to the possibility
totally reasonable being sure
not reasonable not even a little bit
reasonable now i might be going a little
bit harder on you
than i normally would because i realize
you know i watch my
my twitter followers when i do stuff
like this it goes forever
so so this is all bad for me if i
you know if i go at you directly because
you're you know you're primarily my
audience
but having watched the damage that
happened to the
people who bought into the queue stuff
i feel today that i let you down
you meaning the public not you
specifically i feel like i let you down
because months ago i was or years ago i
guess a few years
i was pushing pretty hard against the
queue stuff and i sort of made it a
thing
you know i was gonna use my time and my
whatever credibility i had to
to see if i could stop that thing for
the good of all now at the time
i really didn't know how big it would
get i certainly didn't know it would
you know incite a uh some kind of
trouble at the uh or an assault on the
capitol
you know i didn't know that i think that
was um
not obvious you know at any point two
years ago
but um
so yeah i'm saying in the comments scott
take a break and collect yourself
you're losing it see this is what i'm
gonna do more of not less
so so those are the comments i'm looking
to see
i want the people who think i've just
completely lost it
because if you've watched me for four
years or whatever
and you've agreed with me up to this
point
or at least you've agreed with some
majority of things i've said up to this
point i'll ask you this one thing
just consider just consider
that i might be right now i might be
wrong as well
you could consider that too but don't
rule it out i mean if
if you've been watching my live streams
um and you were to compare what you
predicted
to me if your predictions are better
then
don't pay attention to me but probably
for most of you
that wasn't the case so put it all in
context
you sound merely like a lawyer somebody
says
consider will there be uh will i be
sipping sanka just looking at some of
your
comments all right so
joe biden i would say that
so far he looks to be a disaster on
immigration
i mean like this could be really really
bad
i don't think it will be so it's a
statistical thing again
but what the heck is he going to do
right oh i was talking about the the
kids in cages thing for those who
don't understand the topic and that
would be most people i guess
and probably in that category as well
but one thing i do understand
is that the cages were primarily a
short-term uh way to keep kids away from
predators
because they were the the predators were
taking them across the border and
god knows what kind of things were going
to happen to the kids and
if you the only way to separate them
given the
the the tons of people who came in
compared to the resources that they
they had was to do something that nobody
wanted to do
which is physically separate the kids
put them in these things that people are
calling cages
i don't think you could be happy about
it you can't be happy about
anything like that that happens to a kid
but
you can certainly say i get why it
happened
so the point is how is biden going to
have a better result
because he has the same problem and he
has the same
two solutions nobody came up with a
middle ground
including you know biden and anybody who
criticized them
so one solution is you let those kids go
with the predators and that's
basically you're killing the kid you
know at least in terms of the
quality of the rest of their life um
and the other thing is you put them in
cages and that's
unacceptable you know on a human level
so if you only have two choices
and they're both terrible for kids
what's biden gonna do now if it turns
out
that biden figures out you know his
administration figures out a way
to deal with this in an efficient way
that's better than what
the trump administration did i'll give
him credit
i'd like to see that and if he could do
that that'd be great you know as long as
we have good border security in canada
now my take on border security is that
if you argue how many people should come
in
you're arguing it wrong the way to argue
border security
is this you say we need to have complete
border security
but that's one decision so one decision
is to control your borders
yes or no the answer's got to be yes
right
because nobody who has a country that
everybody wants to move to
can get away with having no borders just
there's just no way that can work in the
long run
so anyway biden's going to have to close
the border but my point was
he's gonna have to control the border in
some fashion we'll see what he does but
my point is that you make the decision
about do you control your border or not
once you say yes that's one decision
and then the second decision which is
separate
is how do you control it oops
who do you let in in under what
circumstances
so i think those decisions should be
separate i think there's a hundred
percent solid argument
for having a border that we can open and
close as the situation requires
it's just having a tool so arguing
against having a toolbox
is just stupid arguing about how to use
those tools
makes perfect sense so i would love to
see an immigration system
that removes human uh judgment as much
as possible
from the decision of who gets in and
here's the way you can do it
imagine that economists probably have to
be you know bipartisan economists
come up with some kind of a formula and
it's just the best they can do right
these
these types of algorithms and formulas
are going to be approximations at best
but let's say the economist come up with
some kind of formula that says this
under our current conditions let's say
unemployment rate and
whatever kinds of jobs we need to be
filled
uh under a certain set of conditions you
just turn the knob and let more people
in
because it's good for us it's good for
them it's good for us
economies humming along you need a few
more people turn the knob a little bit
let them in
then whatever happens maybe you have
some terrorism issues and pandemic
issues
economic issues and you just say based
on
you know these these criteria that
everybody can see
we'll have to dial it back a little if
you did that
who whose fault would it be right you
could remove the humans from it just say
look
these are the conditions in which you
want more people of a certain type
these are the conditions where you don't
and we'll just adjust up and down based
on those conditions
nobody even has to make a decision we
just look at the data
unemployment is seven percent turn it
down
unemployment drops to you know i know
three percent
turn it up that's it get the people out
of the decision there's no situation
in which we don't want immigration uh
we just want to be able to control it
um yeah so biden's promised a hundred
know what a million million vaccinations
a day which is basically
what we're already doing so that's a
good promise
uh if i'm gonna be um
i'm gonna try as hard as possible i
don't think i'll be able to pull this
off but i'm going to try as hard as
possible
to be objective about biden now i
criticize trump on the
rapid testing and health care and the
capital assault and
you know i've had a bunch of things that
i've criticized
trump for i want to i want to do the
same
so some of your comments are cruel
they're cruel
um cnn removed counter what's that mean
uh scott what about asylum
that's where the problem lies yeah
why would we need asylum if we had a
good immigration system so the problem
always comes back to immigration control
you wouldn't need any
asylum cities if you had a good
immigration system there would be nobody
here who needed asylum
so you want to fix the base problem is
what you want to do
uh somebody says we'll see civil war
we're not we're nowhere near that the
the most likely thing that will happen
let's see just in general well let me
give you some big big context
um it is generally true that every
big world power through history
has reached some point where they
declined right roman empire
boom um you know you go through history
the mayan empire or boom so
there's probably no situation in the
long long
long run where any any country just
dominates forever
or is at the top of the pile or even
exists in the long run long run
but the end of a uh
a civilization happens once
right you only you only get finished
once
but there's just hundreds or thousands
of things that happen between the start
and that one time you're done
they'll look like bad things are going
to happen then they don't
and so if you're going to follow the
odds what are the odds
that you just happen to be alive and
it's this year
that we had you know the destruction of
the united states in the civil war
nothing's impossible but what are the
odds
like solo i don't talk to anybody who
wants a revolution
you know i hear lots of people
complaining about
freedom of speech and the private
platform companies
restricting it in their private way not
the public way
you know everybody's got a complaint
right some people's
still mad about the election and
everything else but i don't see
anybody who wants a civil war
just doesn't seem possible the most
likely thing that will happen
is that success will kill whoever is
winning
that's the most likely thing that
happens so the beauty of our
two let's say our two system or
two-party system
is that you have a way for somebody to
lose
every four years and that loser
goes back and gets stronger and then
comes back and fights again and
sometimes win
so the most likely outcome of a
successful
republican presidency would be a
democrat is next
the most likely outcome of a successful
or even an unsuccessful uh four to eight
years of democrat
presidents is a republican the most
likely thing that will happen after
biden is a republican
and that's even with any kind of you
know clever mischief that the democrats
do
to out of state legalize some
you know undocumented people who become
voters put them in the census
you know they can do lots of stuff but
our country
really really likes two parties fighting
it out and not one of them winning every
time
and i speculate no way to know this for
sure
but i speculate that one of the the
worst
problems that trump had in terms of
reelection
was his success and specifically his
success
in uh in the supreme court nominations
i feel that trump was so successful
sort of locking down a republican
conservative
power base in the supreme court that it
ended
because we don't like anybody to move
too much power in one direction
it just we just like that middle
americans do
so the most likely outcome is a biden
slash harris overreach could last four
years could last eight years
but the the most logical outcome of that
would be
people saying all right we had enough of
this let's try something else
that's what i think now it's not it's
not impossible
that things would slippery slope all the
way to the end of the
republic could happen but uh
not very likely yeah i'd put that in the
one percent
range maybe something like that
uh oh please explain what's the middle
in 2021 well the middle is a lot of
stuff
the middle is being able to control
immigration
no matter what you decide to do with how
many people get it
that's that's the middle ground if you
said to somebody
we'll let in as many people as make
sense but we want the option of closing
the border if we need to
would people really argue against that
you're just saying we want the tool
but we'd like to we'd love to let in as
many people from
central and you know south american and
mexico
to to do the jobs that need to be filled
it's fairly middle ground infrastructure
fairly middle
um you know i think energy policy
at least the public is closer to the
middle there was
uh what was it that uh biden did
recently that's
oh i think it's the the keystone
pipeline
has a majority of public approval
and he decided to go against the
majority on that
so um
all right let me show you where i'm at
you want to see my situation here
so i'm in bora bora and
that is in french polynesia i'll show
you
just the back of the bungalow here
so we got this porch situation
and then so it's raining right now
so i'm under a covered area
and this is just about the most
beautiful place
you'll ever see in your life and there
are a bunch of these
bungalows see this one behind me let's
see
so the one i'm in is sort of similar to
the one you see in the background there
it's kind of like that and
so this morning uh i was i was tweeting
this morning i'll give you an update on
it
so every time i go to a hotel i have
this problem which i call a
sort of engineer sort of
engineering blindness that i have
which is if i have a user interface or
some kind of device that i have to turn
on
and they don't build it right i can't
figure out where the on button is
because they don't put it where i can
find it it's like
and my blindness is that if i know the
button should be in a place
and it's not there i i'm literally blind
to where else it is because it shouldn't
be there
makes no sense but it's just you know
bias i bring to everything
so this place has all kinds of weird uh
a lighting i'll take you inside let's go
inside
you have to actually see this to
appreciate it
so yeah in other countries to get all
these weird situations of light switch
i'll just give you a sample of that
all right you see this panel what's all
this business
what what's this guy what is all this
what are these guys so you know none of
this labeled
so i'm like trying to try to figure it
all out now
and then you've got let's see over here
here's my favorite part see this
this is if you if you read it carefully
you have to go way
like really close i don't think you can
see it
i think it says main switch
it's the main switch so now
if you were designing this room and you
put something near the front door
near the entry door it was called the
main switch
what would you think that did would you
think you controlled all the lights
because that's what i thought i thought
oh my lights are not coming on i'll just
turn on the main switch
but i turned on the main switch and it
only turned on my bathroom light
and the light directly above christina's
head
in the bed where she was trying to sleep
and i thought
that is not what i'd call a main light
because keep in mind the other lights
didn't come on i couldn't even with the
switches they didn't come on
hours later six hours of of sitting in
the dark and
texting the uh the front desk to tell me
can you please tell me how to turn in
the lights
and they say we'll send somebody right
over i said no
no don't send anybody over simply tell
me
where i could find the magic button
because i know there's one in here
there's a way to turn on the lesson here
i'll find that button just tell me where
it is and they said
well you know get that master switch i'm
like
been there been there master switch
not the answer then they said well what
about the master switch in the bedroom
and i said you have two
master switches is that a master switch
for the bedroom
separate from the master switch from the
other nope
they're all master switches so
apparently this was
the whole place was uh wired by an
electrician who just hated people
that's that's my best guess just an
electrician who hated people
so here here's the outer room
see if i can clear that up for you does
that help you see it or no
nope so you probably can't see much out
that window but that's
the situation in here
so we uh we had to travel through tahiti
so we stayed at a place in tahiti
for uh one night and
doing anything in another country is
just uh
so hard to figure out so christina
uh wanted to do an errand before we flew
over to boragora
and we're told that tahiti is so
safe that it's perfectly safe for a
woman to go
you know off in a taxi do some errands
and come back to the hotel
but there's so few taxis in tahiti i
don't know why
they don't have uber uber and they're
only a few taxis and there's so few
that they go by their first name
so if you want a taxi you ask for diane
or kathy those are the brands
when we got picked up at the airport the
there was a chinese woman who was the uh
a driver and she goes i'm diane diane
and she kept telling me
i'm diane if you need a taxi call diane
i thought
that's weird why do i really need to
know her first name then i found out the
whole system
you know when you see the business cards
of all the taxis you can call
it's just the first names of several
people who and it's not their real name
she could tell
her name was not diane when she was born
in china
so so christina we managed to get a cab
and she takes one
to do her errand and then she can't get
a taxi back
she's got internet connection problems
and it took us
it took hours to retrieve her and find a
find a taxi and get it to her and all
that
but in the meantime she comes back she
finally gets back
and she says uh you know gosh there are
more people
men in cars like doing wolf whistles and
you know cat calls and stuff i've never
seen it this bad
and so then i'm i'm feeling bad because
i feel like i should have gone with her
because it didn't sound as safe as i
thought
and i said well how bad was it she goes
well i'm just walking down the street
and
you know people men are like yelling at
me from the cars and stuff and i go
but how much are you talking about
two or three she goes no no way way
way more than that i go are you telling
me
that in just the hour or so that you
were walking down the street
that more than 10 people
yelled at you from a car some kind of
sexual harassing thing
she goes no no way more than 10.
and i said give me a rough estimate
while you were walking down the street
for one hour in a public place
totally safe like a main highway right
not any kind of seedy place or anything
how many how many people would you just
roughly estimate she said
50 to 100
her estimate was at least 50 separate
cars
often with multiple men so in one hour
she was she was catcalled by
50 to 100 people
i have no idea if that's some kind of
weird cultural thing or if it was just
the christina effect because you know
i'm not sure that's even so different if
she's
walking around in miami or something but
that was just crazy um
how is that possible i don't know
she is the most beautiful woman in the
world so
[Music]
uh there's that
in the in the comments uh i'm seeing
people saying you're bragging you're
bragging
of course i am i told christine i was
going to tell this story and then people
would say
you're you're cleverly bragging
and let me just say that your your
insight
is incredible all right
so i don't know if i'll be able to do
coffee with scott adams tomorrow morning
at the appointed time
i really i really thought i'd be there
this morning
but it did take me several hours to
figure out how to turn on the lights
here
not that i'm proud of it
all right
i'm just looking at your comments for a
second um
and somebody says you seem stressed are
you kidding
i've never been so relaxed in my life
that
just the first day here is the most
relaxing thing i've ever felt
there's something about the temperature
the water
i don't know what it is but you don't
feel the same here that's for sure
so i'll be here until the 20 i think i'm
returning on the 29th
it's a i think it'll be uh eight days
actually here but a lot of travel
um do you like the color of the wood
have you been swimming now we're gonna i
got my trunks on now
going swimming in a moment
yeah i'll be sunscreening like crazy all
right got my i got nothing else to say
um by the way i'm coming to you on my
phone using stream yard software
stream yard lets me use one device to
send to both
periscope and youtube and others
it looks like it's working really well
so i'm actually
pretty impressed with this i think i
might end up using this going forward
oh you're you're listening to my book
how to failed almost everything
good sound is good i think what my
problem with with the buzzing sound
is i use my laptop as a stand
for my other device so i just put my
other device on the laptop and i think
it's too many devices close to each
other
[Music]
yes thank you for missing me cat but i
will be
uh you only get you only get one
vacation like this in your life
