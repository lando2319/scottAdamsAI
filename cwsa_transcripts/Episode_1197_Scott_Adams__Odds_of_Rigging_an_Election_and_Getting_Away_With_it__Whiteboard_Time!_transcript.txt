hey
come on in it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and
today there will be a whiteboard
yeah just when you thought today
couldn't get it any better
and then you found out that coffee with
scott adams features
a whiteboard and you said to yourself oh
that's as good as they can get wait wait
wait
it's a double-sided white board yeah
you didn't see that coming did you
that's right and in order to enjoy
the double-sided white board to its full
extent
what do you need not much
a copper margaret glass a tanker
challenger stein a canteen joker flask
a vessel of any kind
and you can fill it with your favorite
liquid i
impartial to coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine hit of the day
thing that makes everything better way
better
seventy-five percent better it's called
the simultaneous zip it happens now go
i feel science becoming more accurate
i feel data starting to
be credible and that's just one sip
imagine if i finish that entire mug oh
yeah oh yeah all right and we'll talk
about the election
and allegations of fraud
in a moment but some fun stories first
we have yet another potential vaccine
that could make a big difference
oxford dash a-z
so astrazeneca i guess they've got a
vaccine that has a
strange story to it here's the strange
story
it was a big old scientific trial
and it was supposed to be two doses to
each person
but they discovered after they had given
a bunch of the first
doses that the first doses had been
um by mistake half as much as they were
supposed to be
so then they said well what do we do now
because we started this trial
and the first doses are all the wrong
amount
so they said well we can salvage it
by at least giving the full dose on the
second one
and let's just see what happens and what
happened was
it turns out according according to
their initial data
i've got some questions about the
accuracy of the data
but their data says that when they got a
half dose
followed i think a month later by a full
dose
that they got to 90
efficiency of the of the vaccine
but when they did it the way they were
supposed to do it
two full doses it was only 60
as effective now there are a few
possible ways to explain this
number one way everything about this
trial
is wrong now was there a point
in this whole vaccine situation where
you said to yourself
i'm feeling pretty good about science
because scientists are are killing it
you know this whole
warp speed thing man
clap clap clap for our scientists around
the world
not just in the united states but other
countries too
and they're just killing it with this
development of the vaccine
so science is something you can depend
on
except wait what was that thing you said
to me scott about
science did an entire
randomized drug trial of the most
important thing in the world
that could be tested at this moment
coronavirus vaccine
and in the most important trial
or one of the few for these vaccines one
of the most important trials
in the world maybe in all of
civilization
and how many people had to look at that
whatever the directions were how many
people looked at that study
before rolling it out to not know that
they had somehow accidentally given
everybody half a dose are you still
really confident about your scientific
process
because the trouble is that science as a
system
is terrific compared to other ways of
understanding your reality but
unfortunately
science is populated with people
and while we can all agree that science
as a concept
is pretty darn awesome can we also agree
that human beings as entities are pretty
darn shitty
in fact i could give you a pretty long
list
of human beings work total crap
and unfortunately when you take a
concept like science which is terrific
really excellent and you combine it with
organic creatures who tend to be pretty
shitty
on average you give something that's the
average of something awesome
science and something pretty shitty
people so that's how you get half a dose
so put that right in your arm huh
yeah let let me shoot up with a vaccine
that the best scientists in was a great
britain
couldn't figure out the difference
between half a dose and a full dose
yeah i got a lot of confidence in that
one i think i'll take the american
vaccine
that's just me i think i'll take the
american one
not that it's necessarily better by the
way i am
i am pro-vaccination just to be clear
i'm pro-vaccination but it's always a
tentative opinion meaning i'd change it
in a heartbeat
if the data changes so i'm not going to
make a personal decision
about taking a vaccine the coronavirus
vaccine
any one of the different vaccines i'm
not going to make a personal decision
until when
last minute if you're making a decision
now instead of waiting for the last
minute
you're doing it wrong because there
might be new information
so you know i'm not going to wait for
people to take it then wait a year to
see if they have any health problems
i probably won't do that but i'm
certainly going to wait
as long as i can before i make a
decision just in case
i think that i'll probably take it but
here's the other interesting thing about
this oxford
astrazeneca story
the the accident may have discovered
something
that's really really important in the
same way
that yellow sticky notes were discovered
by accident
and i think penicillin was discovered by
accident and
a lot of things get discovered by
accident could it be
and some of the scientists have
speculated that there is something about
giving a half dose and sort of maybe
priming your body a little bit you know
it's like a putting down a primer coat
of paint or something
and then a month later when you give the
full dose
what if that makes the vaccination way
way better
could it be that they accidentally
discovered
an effect that is monstrously important
which is if you give people a small dose
of a drug
let your body acclimate and then give
them a bigger dose
is that something that could work in
other situations
or is it something unique to this one
vaccination or is it just bad data
could be any of those things but
possibly it's a gigantic
possibly a gigantic discovery
that we're just seeing the first glimmer
of maybe you never know
i like to look on the bright side well
the big story of course is that
trump has authorized the gsa to fund
and assist in the biden transition does
that mean that president trump in his
secret
inner thoughts is really conceding
well we don't know his secret in her
thoughts
we don't know them at all
but i would say if he is consistent with
his past
he keeps his options open why wouldn't
you
everything we know about trump is that
he always keeps his options open
so he does have technically a path to
the presidency
another term so the fact that he's doing
something
in case it goes the way most people
think is going to go
at the same time he's keeping his option
open in court etc
nothing wrong with that completely
consistent and
does not tell us his state of mind in
the same way that it made sense
to do operation warp speed by
producing a bunch of vaccines before we
had tested them
just so we'd have them ready in case
they worked it's the same thing
good risk management is what trump did
with warp speed
he said let's let's put a billion
dollars into it
or probably multiple billion to make the
vaccine
vaccines just in case they're safe we'll
find out later but we could always just
throw the vaccines away
if we have to so same same reason they
should do the transition just in case
it's uh it's it goes the way it looks
like it's going to go
and still keep your options open so
apparently there's a some data out that
79
of trump supporters believe the election
was fraudulent
79 now
do you remember back in 2016 one of the
biggest
uh one of the biggest criticisms that i
personally received
was scott are you telling me you think
that president
trump or candidate trump at the time are
you telling me you think trump is
persuasive
where's the evidence of that i don't see
any evidence he's persuasive
well how about convincing 79 of
his supporters that an election had been
thrown
you can't get much more persuasive than
that
now keep in mind that persuasion tends
to only work on your own team
it's not like the democrats are
persuading the republicans or vice versa
that's sort of not a thing used to be a
little bit
but it's not really a thing at the
moment so
watching uh trump persuade
his own base is really a remarkable
thing
do you do you think anybody else could
have persuaded 79
of their base to think the election was
rigged
maybe i don't know but it's still pretty
impressive
right yeah oh yes and then the
in the comments somebody's reminding me
that 30
of democrats think the election was
fraudulent
30 that's about as persuasive as you can
get or
is it we're going to get to that in a
moment
we'll talk about whether it would be
reasonable to assume
as these many people have that the
election was fraudulent
in the face of don't the democrats tell
us
every single day there's no evidence
where's all the evidence if you have
zero evidence
how could you possibly convince 79 of
the people
that fraud happened with zero evidence
how does that happen well it could be
because there is evidence
and democrats just say there isn't you
know i would say the
the sworn statements from over 200
people that they personally observed
irregularities is
evidence so
here's a question for you uh just hold
this
question in the back of your head
because it will get funnier over time
all right so we'll just put it in there
now and let it
just let it simmer it's going to get
better
and here's the thought democrats have
said that
trump has done tremendous damage
in his first term and indeed one of the
reasons
for what them wanting to replace him is
to prevent the further
tremendous damage that he would do
so how long is it going to take biden to
fix all of that
damage and what was the damage
can somebody remind you what the damage
is that biden is fixing
is it the climate because there's a big
difference in
uh in the climate opinion right
but correct me if i'm wrong hasn't the
trump administration
lowered our emissions below the paris
accords if we had stayed in them so
it doesn't look like there's much to fix
in terms of the climate because we were
actually doing great
what about um the middle east will biden
go in there and fix
everything that trump broke in the
middle east
well no actually it looks like trump
fixed the middle east
or at least it's heading in the right
direction israel's making friends with
a number of neighboring countries like
never before
iran seems to be you know marginalized
and
things seem to be relatively less
war-like than normal
so i don't know what he's fixing there
how about the economy
trump had the economy just humming along
until coronavirus of course
now will biden fix the coronavirus
there's not much he can do for the
economy that's the economy's going to do
what it did what it does
but will will biden come in
and on inauguration day he's going to
come in and say
people people wear your masks
and then people will if this is my
understanding of how this is going to
work
people who had been under a trump
administration
because he was a little less let's say
assertive about wearing masks
he agrees with it but he's not really
pushing it
um it feels as if when trump was
let's say a little tepid little lukewarm
about masks
that that caused people to wear fewer
masks
that's the claim right so when biden
becomes president
will you be more likely to wear a mask
so in the comments tell me because
obviously the democrats were all wearing
masks
as my understanding i mean you could
fact check that but my understanding is
that
since democrats don't listen to trump
or they want to do whatever is the
opposite he says
you would expect the democrats were
already wearing their masks
right i mean sure maybe sometimes they
get caught without one
but let's say generally they're wearing
their masks oh in the comments you think
i'm wrong
you think democrats are not wearing
masks well that doesn't make any sense
how could it be that democrats are not
wearing masks
completely because
they're not listening to trump because
they're democrats
oh well
anybody who believes that biden is going
to tell the public to wear masks
and then we just will i don't think you
understand how people work
i don't think he's going to fix the mask
thing
and how about if he does some kind of a
national standard for the states
are the states going to say oh well
that's what we're waiting for
we're waiting for that national standard
i don't think so i think the states are
going to say uh
we're all different every state's
different
how about we know what we're supposed to
do we're listening to the same experts
now why don't we do it our way and you
do it your way and maybe we'll see
who did better i don't know how
i don't know exactly what biden's going
to fix
do you can you give me a list of all the
things that trump
broke what did he break
what did he break that's going to get
fixed because this is a very basic
belief
of the democrats not only that trump
might do
bad things but that he already broke
stuff
now let's say you say scott scott's got
the obvious one
is the coronavirus the united states has
higher death rate than a lot of places
and therefore
trump broke that now suppose i say
okay let's take that as a given
if i accepted that that's true isn't
that in the past
because how do you fix the past
is joe biden going to use his time
machine
to go back and fix the past i don't
think that's an option
so what is it he's going to do that
would be that different
than what trump would have done if he
had a second term
i feel like the mask wearing is going to
be pretty similar
i feel like the the shutdowns are going
to be pretty similar
and i feel like the vaccines are going
to come out and be delivered
pretty similarly so even if you accepted
oh we hate what trump already did in the
past
and even if you accept that it was you
know mistake and caused x number of
lives
even if you believe that how does that
translate into the future
because now we actually understand the
situation in a way we didn't before
so now that we understand it better i
would imagine that a republican and a
democrat would end up acting the same
way
when you didn't know what worked and
what didn't which is
the early months then you would expect
some people would get it wrong
some people would get it right but now
that we're
far more informed still not quite
informed
but more informed i would expect a
democrat and a republican to look
pretty much the same you know they might
have a difference in what
school so did did trump
break school no
it looks like the democrats broke that
and the teachers unions
i think the teachers unions broke the
schools that wasn't trump he tried to
break the the teachers unions all right
so look for that just think about
where's all this damage
that the democrats are fixing and what
are they doing to fix it
so uh
remember i predicted that if uh joe
biden won
republicans would be hunted and i was
roundly mocked
through society for such a ridiculous
thing well of course we've seen people
get assaulted just for being trump
supporters so indeed they are hunted on
the street
and certainly they will be ferreted out
in in employment etc but here's
something that rachel maddow
said last night i guess so rachel maddow
asked an naacp legal defense counsel
cheryl lynn ifill she said
trump officials are challenging the
election
she asked if they should be sent to jail
for challenging the election
which is not a crime and she knows it
right so
rachel maddow is literally in public
right this is not a private conversation
and there's no
question about whether she said it or
not you know it's
it's on video it's public and she's
asking the question
in public if people who broke no laws
because there's no even allegation of a
broken law just questioning the outcome
if they should be jailed you
 you piece of
rachel maddow she's asking if trump's
supporters should be
jailed for not breaking a crime
just doubting the outcome of an election
think about that now when now when you
were mocking me for saying that
republicans would be hunted
what the is this what the
is this if this is not a pretty clean
signal
that democrats are willing to jail
i mean that's her word she used the word
jail i'm not interpreting
the word jail should be sent to jail
so they feel like they did something
wrong
it
[Music]
who the calls me at this time of
day jesus christ
um sorry didn't mean to
take your lord's name in vain there
slipped out
um but this is shocking
so rachel maddow should lose her job for
that don't you think
i mean it's not going to happen but
don't you think she should lose her job
for suggesting that republicans should
be jailed
just to make them feel differently she
said that
i'm not making that up she said
they should be do you think they should
go to jail so that they
feel like they did something wrong
in order to stop trumpism from becoming
the norm
she actually said that
amazing um i hope that
trump does some kind of a clever pardon
before he leaves office
you know something like stepping down on
the last day of his
term and having penn spartan him for
everything he's ever
done i hope that happens now normally i
would say
i sure hope that anybody who committed a
crime
gets caught i mean typically i would
like people to get caught for doing
crimes
but what exactly is trump's crime
can you think of one i i have not heard
a crime even alleged have you
apparently there are all these lawsuits
in the southern district of new york and
they're looking through his financials
and stuff
but do be a fact check on this
has anybody alleged a crime
and why haven't we heard it what's what
is the specific crime
because otherwise it looks like they're
just looking for a crime
are you okay with that are you okay that
a
politician can be examined just to see
if there's a crime
without any evidence that there was a
crime are you okay with that
i'm not okay with that and as a
principal
i would i would prefer that if you
imagine that trump
broke some law i would i would prefer
that he'd get away with it
rather than have a norm that you can
just go looking for crimes
if there's no evidence of a crime so
which looks like what's happening now if
it turns out there is
all this evidence of a crime that i
don't know about then i will revise
my opinion but based on what we don't
know
it looks like they're after him for
political reasons and i think that
should be shut down
so if trump and pence used a political
trick you know to sort of pardon him for
everything that happened
up to that point in life i think that
would be appropriate
because there's a trick being used
against him so if you use a trick
to counter another trick
i'm okay with that 100 i
and i and i very much hope that it
happens and again i don't care if
there's a real crime or not
because whether or not there's a real
crime is a much lower priority
then we shouldn't be doing this we
shouldn't be doing this
because you know if if i could go to
your house and tear it apart and look
through all your financials
could i find any crimes
i'd probably find something that's why
we don't do that
so i guess joe biden has picked
jake sullivan to serve as national
security advisor and
joel pollock points out that sullivan
would be taking the job that mike flynn
had briefly
and the sullivan had falsely accused
flynn of russia collusion
so the guy who would take flynn's job as
somebody who falsely
accused flynn of a crime of russia
collusion
not even just a normal crime like the
the crime of all crimes
all right you got bill de blasio closing
public schools because
the city is at three percent positivity
for coronavirus but the schools
themselves are only at
point two eight so
we should follow the science right
here's i can say this a million times
and most people won't be able to hear it
there there's some ideas
that we just can't hear i don't know
it's a it's an unusual
phenomenon i'll give you one some of you
will be able to hear what i say next
some of you just can't hear it
like it'll be like noise like charlie
brown's teacher
and so this will be an experiment and it
goes like this
we all know we should trust science and
we should trust the experts
but they interpret things differently
the experts and the scientists
look at the same data and they interpret
it differently
so who how can you trust them trusting
science is a good idea
trusting scientists is the dumbest
 idea in the world
because they're people and people can't
be trusted
people can be right and people can be
wrong
but you can't trust them
you can't trust them you can trust them
if you've got lots of visibility
and you know their controls and
somebody's double-checking
but that's not really trusting is it
that's more like making sure that all of
the opportunity for cheating is
and mischief has been removed but
trust science but i don't have access to
science do you
reach into your pocket and grab me a
grab me a handful of science
do you have any because i don't have any
i
look at look at my shelves i get i got
some books on my shelves but i don't
have any science
i don't have science i can't get my
hands around it
don't have access to it i'll tell you
what i do have
people telling me their opinions that's
what i have
i don't have any science i got
people
telling me their opinions about science
i don't trust people
are you kidding me i don't trust people
at all in that way
whereas somebody wise said i forget who
somebody said recently the one thing you
can trust
is that people will act like people you
can definitely trust that
you can trust that all right
um hypothetically
here's a question i asked and i got some
answers i think are pretty good
hypothetically what would happen if the
process goes forward
and it goes all the way through the
electoral college process
biden gets confirmed goes to the house
i don't know the exact process but i
guess the house
says that they confirm it or they
validate it or whatever
let's say it goes all the way through
the system and biden is
ready to be inaugurated or even he gets
inaugurated
my understanding is that the actual
inaugura inauguration is unnecessary
it's more of a ceremony but let's say he
goes through the process that he's
absolutely
the president of the united states our
constitution is acted the supreme court
has
spoken if they get involved it's just
done
and then hypothetically just asking the
question
and then after that
proof comes out that the election was
rigged
and rigged sufficiently that it changed
the outcome
what would happen
because haven't all the experts been
telling us
it's too late
correct me if i'm wrong hasn't every
expert
said you know once it gets to this point
well then it's just too late it's over
is it is it
i'm not so sure because let's say it
were proven in court
that the election were were was wrong
let's say it went to the supreme court
and they said all right here it is it's
proof and let's say the supreme court
looks at the proof and they go oh okay
that's proof yeah that that actually is
proof
and let's say hypothetically they were
convinced
what do they do now somebody said
impeachment
maybe i don't i have no idea
i have no idea and i'm not sure our
system quite knows
but if you tell me that producing that
proof
after tr after biden gets officially in
office
if you're telling me that doesn't matter
i'm not so
sure i think it might matter
it might matter um maybe we'll find out
so trump tweeted that uh that in
wisconsin so he's quoting
victoria tensing who's also an attorney
and he's quoting her saying in wisconsin
somebody has to be
indefinitely confined in order to vote
absentee
so i guess this claim is you'd have to
be
i don't know shut in or something
and in the past there were 20 000 people
in wisconsin
this past election there were 120 000
and republicans were locked down to the
vote counting process
so the president tweeted that and i
looked at that and i thought
uh that's a that's a pretty
easy claim to check right
i mean these are facts which are in the
public record
so i thought is that true
so i just tweeted down and said is this
true and it took about
five seconds for somebody to send me a
link to the wisconsin page
that shows that this is not true
it's not even it's not even slightly
true it's not
it's not even in the zip code if true
it's not
in the galaxy of true it's nowhere near
true
there's nothing about it that's true so
uh so which of the experts we're
listening to
is uh victoria tensing she's an attorney
high-end attorney and she obviously has
all of the skills and expertise to look
into
a let's say a legal
election situation and then interpret it
for you
because that's what an attorney does
they'll look at the law
and then tell you what they saw so she's
an expert
is she right it doesn't look like it
so anybody who tells me to listen to the
experts
what planet are you on what planet are
you
on that listening to experts has worked
out really well for you
when they disagree i promised you
i don't know a couple weeks ago that
your understanding of reality was about
to change
because of this election situation i
would argue that it has
but i saw some critics pushing back
saying it hadn't because it looks like
biden's going to take the job
but let me let me fill this idea out a
little bit
all right do you think the will of the
people
was important to the election outcome in
other words do you think that we just
experienced
something like democracy do you think
that
people looked at the information made
decisions
voted we counted the votes
we picked we picked a winner is that
what happened
because here's what i saw i saw first of
all
that social media has been brainwashing
the public for years
so i saw a social media brainwashing
that's very very effective because
they're good at it
so where does brainwashing come in
from social media with your free
specific example
that's just mind-boggling mind-boggling
so last night on uh the the show the
five
on fox news uh richard fowler was
the um sitting in for the
the person representing the left sitting
in for juan williams i believe
and he claimed on television
in public that he personally believed
that the president of the united states
had once recommended
drinking bleach
he thinks that happened now
all the other members of the five
literally yelled at him when he said
that
in unison that didn't happen because it
didn't happen
the president never used the word bleach
never used the word drinking
he talked about injecting disinfectants
in the concept of
light as a disinfectant you can put it
on a
ventilator stick it in the lungs and
there was a trial that was being
you know ready to look in to see if that
could work
so the president said he was just joking
but any
which i don't buy that one but in either
case
it is easy to confirm he definitely
didn't say drink bleach
and richard fowler and i'm sure he was
not lying
i you know he looked completely honest
when he was saying this
and i believe it because i don't think
he's you know i don't think he would lie
about it
he believed he actually saw it
he didn't believe he heard about it
he believed he witnessed it think about
this
now richard fowler is not just a voter
this is somebody whose job is talking
about
presidential politics every day
he's a professional richard fowler would
be
i would guess my cat's doing a walk by
here
i would guess that richard fowler would
be in the top
one percent of well-informed
people in this country would you agree
with me somebody who does it for a job
yeah and they're so good at it that
they're on tv they're on radio shows
podcasts whatever richard fowler is a
high
end super well-informed political person
he thought he witnessed the president
telling the country to drink bleach or
suggesting
and it it never happened but the fake
news said it happened so many times
that he has a false memory of it i mean
to watch this happen
is amazing to see it happen in real time
so you got your fake news you got your
uh the changes and the mail-in ballots
probably that alone changed the election
if we know that republicans like to vote
in person we know the democrats
and low-motivated people might send in a
ballot
we know there's more more possibility of
mischief
so probably the thing that affected the
election was
whatever social media brainwashed you
for whatever the fake news created as
your reality
the mail in ballots which is a process
change which probably changed the
outcome
just the fact that there was a
coronavirus and they had to
do mail-in ballots probably could change
the outcome
and then what about the fraud we'll talk
about that in a minute
so so
how much of what i just mentioned
[Music]
that's my cat talking to you how much of
what i just mentioned is
the people's will none of it it's the
opposite of the people's will
nothing like democracy happened there
was
nothing like democracy that just
happened in the united states but
we probably will get over it
we probably will get past it within a
civil war
which is a credit to the the country i
think
um now i don't recommend this
and let me emphasize this the next thing
i'm going to say
i do not recommend do not recommend it
but if it happened it'd be funny which
is
republicans rigging the senate race in
georgia
using the same tricks that they believe
the democrats used
that the democrats say are impossible
it would just be hilarious because if
the
republicans used their same techniques
and the democrats knew it
what would they do because they couldn't
really call them out for the technique
because their entire argument is that
these techniques can't work
not that they didn't work that they
can't
it just isn't possible so again i'm not
recommending it
because it's breaking the law i never
recommend breaking the law
but it would be funny i'm just saying it
would be funny
i don't recommend it all right
so i tweet this at the milwaukee
recount is going slowly because trump's
attorneys have been constantly
interrupting and challenging
tens of thousands of ballots
what is it that you would challenge on
these ballots
if a an attorney challenges a ballot
what would be the basis well i would
think the basis would be
a technical problem like an address
wasn't complete
or a signature didn't match
aren't those supposed to be rejected
now i know there's a process for curing
them going back to the
the voter but that process has passed
i believe that there's a time limit
that's probably passed
in which you can cure a ballot so what
happens if the attorneys
find a whole bunch of ballots that maybe
could have been cured
some of them if you were in the right
time frame
but that time frame is passed what
happens
this is really untested territory i
don't know what the legal result is
do they throw them out and then they can
never be cured
because i've got a feeling if you if you
put a lawyer in a room with a bunch of
ballots
that lawyer's gonna have a lot of
arguments it's like well that
that doesn't look like the letter e to
me that looks like
the letter c you got the address wrong
throw that one out
um all right
so then another tweet and again i don't
believe
anything that's data
in all right it doesn't matter what the
topic is it's voting it's coronavirus
doesn't matter
if you believe any public
regardless of the source if you believe
any data you see in public in 2020
you haven't been paying attention it's
pretty much
all unreliable some of it is true
but it's all unreliable okay
and here's one of them 59 counties in
georgia rejected
0 million ballots this year
not zero rounded to the nearest decimal
says the tweet
but actually zero what are the odds
that you know and of course typically
it's only going to be in the
0 to 2.2 range national average is 1
and it was 1.4 in 2016 and 2018.
is that a big difference i mean maybe
maybe the difference between zero and
one percent
maybe there are lots of maybe there are
lots of uh counties that had zero
rejected ballots what do you think
i think the odds of that are pretty
close to zero
meaning that they probably just turned
off the controls
isn't it far more likely that what
happened is nobody was rejecting ballots
in those counties i can't say it's
impossible but i also don't know if the
data is even correct
so don't let me make you think past the
sale because i think i did that
accidentally the sale is whether the
data is even
real right don't get past that
and then thinking that if it is real it
shows that there's fraud
you got to back up i don't know if this
date is real
and if it is real i don't even i don't
know if it's unusual
so you got to figure that out first
don't think past the sale
um let's talk about whether election
cheating is possible okay here's the
here's the big payoff for this live
stream
it how many of you think that it's
possible
to do enough cheating that you would
um change the result of a national
election
and not be spotted how many think that's
a thing that could be done
change a national election so it's got
to be enough fraud to do that
but also not be spotted is it
possible because i'm talking to at least
one smart person who says scott scott
scott
don't you know that the system is
designed
with way too much transparency there's
people watching at every step
you've got witnesses you've got cameras
in the ceiling
you've got signatures you've got
verification
i mean they've removed the ability
to cheat at least cheating in a big
enough scale to change an election
what do you think
now when the democrats and i'm talking
to
one in particular it was very smart very
uh let's say very uh worldly
in terms of would not be some kind of a
virgin
about you know the fact that crime
exists in the world
somebody who's seen enough of the dirty
side of life
who should know where fraud can and
cannot live
believes that the election system is
sufficiently free of it that you could
conclude this was a fair election
just because the way it's designed what
do you think
let's go through it number one
do you believe that the kennedy nixon
election was rigged
now if it was rigged and i believe
historians now agree on this right
give me a fact check but i think the
historians agree
that the kennedy nixon election was
rigged
now did it have to be widespread
apparently not i think it could have
been done in maybe you know
one city that was democrat controlled
for example
chicago or whatever the claim is ohio i
forget
but it didn't need to be widespread
and it was not detected at the time
now have things changed since
the early 60s in terms of have we gone
from an election that could be rigged
to an election that can't be well i
wonder if you went back in time and said
to the people who had created the
election process
hey you guys created this process is
there any way anybody could cheat enough
to change a national election what would
they have said in 1960 whatever
somebody says scott's going full queue
and on
you you have fallen i'm going to block
you for saying that
you have fallen for the narrative
you won't find anything that i say here
that you disagree with
i'll bet you i bet you there's not a
single thing
that i say that you will disagree with
um
so don't you think that during the
kennedy nixon time the people who
designed it
thought that they had a system that
couldn't be cheated
they probably thought they had it
but they didn't apparently so just put
that in the back of your mind and we'll
continue
so have you seen um
did you see the special on cnn
um i hope i hope you all saw this
special on cnn where they went through
the entire
voting process from you know from
beginning to end and they showed you all
the the controls and the way that they
monitor it so that you could see with
your own eyes
from beginning to end there's a trail of
custody
that's watched the whole time you have
multiple observers you've got cameras
you all saw that special right that
showed
that election cheating is so difficult
it basically couldn't happen
did you all see the special oh oh no you
didn't
because it doesn't exist yeah there's no
special like that
but why not isn't that the most obvious
news content you can imagine what would
be a more
obvious thing to put on television if
you were cnn
then a little segment that says look
people think this election was stolen
let us show you
how that's impossible all right let us
just walk you through it
you stupid republican rubes let us just
show you
how the process works and then you
idiots
you won't be thinking he was fraud
because we'll just show you
you couldn't have a fraud in this
situation we'll just lay it out for you
looking for look at it yourself you can
see
there's no opportunity for fraud in this
process
yeah you didn't see that special
did you and you're not gonna see that
special
do you know why yeah you know why
you know exactly why nobody wants to put
that on the air
all right so um
i talked so i asked that question why
are no experts saying that it can't be
done
and an election law expert
weighed in david becker
uc berkeley grad so we know he's smart
uc berkeley very smart so what do you
think an election law expert
said when i asked the question why
haven't we seen
somebody saying that these are secure
elections
and he says i'd really hope you'd listen
to experts
to experts on this because experts are
really
believable so he says i really hope you
listen to experts on this
more paper ballots more identity
validation more audits more bipartisan
observation and transparency
than ever before widespread fraud
is not possible and didn't happen
see what he did there you see how he
inserted the word widespread
did did i say widespread nope
if he had not put the word widespread in
there would he be
would he be so confident nope
it was the uh kennedy nixon
election that was allegedly rigged was
it
widespread no no it was very targeted
so he had to change the argument to
debunk it
and you see this very consistently and
then when i pointed out that he changed
the argument he changed it to some other
argument
so basically nobody is going to touch
this question of whether these elections
are are
cheatable who would be a good expert
to tell you whether a city election
was rigged would you want to hear from
a an election law professional
or would you want to hear from rudy
giuliani
now say what you will about rudy
giuliani
but don't you think he's kind of an
expert on
municipal fraud i would think you would
know more about that than just about
anybody in the world
if you've been a mayor of a major city
and you've been a prosecutor
and you've prosecuted the mafia and you
know you lived in this world of
fraud and crime and it's you know part
of your experience
i think rudy giuliani is an expert and
rudy giuliani says
if philadelphia had a fair election this
time it's the first time in 60 years
why don't you listen to him because
listen to the experts
the the listen to the experts things is
purely
stupidity because you can't tell which
expert to listen to
if you could you know that's a different
conversation
but you can't you can't tell is it rudy
or is it this election professional they
have different opinions
all right so let's talk about whether uh
you had the motive and the opportunity
for fraud in this election
now move this white board over here so
you can see it let's talk about the
motivation first
the fake news has told democrats that
they were dealing with some kind of a
orange hitler if you thought
that you could stop orange hitler
from a second term would you break the
law to do it
well some of you would some of you would
not
if only one person was involved in
elections
well maybe that person would never break
the law
but that's not the case millions of
people are involved
in elections you only need enough of
them
to be willing to break the law for the
law to get broken
you don't need everybody to break the
law you just need
enough and if you have millions of
people
who believe that orange hitler might be
taking a second term
are there enough people who would be
willing
to break the law yes
clearly and unambiguously yes
so there would be enough people willing
but willingness is not
enough to get it done right just be
willing to do it
did they think it was an existential
threat and did they believe
the hoaxes did they believe the fine
people hoax did they believe the
drinking bleach hoax
if you believe this stuff because you
believe the fake news
does that create a situation in which
the motivation
for massive fraud involving potentially
lots of people
is the motivation there yes right
is there anybody watching this who would
disagree with the statement
that the motivation to cheat was higher
than it has ever been
by far not even close because we've
never had this situation
where people had actually been
brainwashed to think that hitler was
maybe taking office for a second term
that's unprecedented so i think
everybody would agree
no matter what kind of expert you are
and hey wait a minute am i an expert
am i an expert on let's say human
motivation
within a large organization i kind of
am in my own way
if you're the author of the dilbert
comic you are kind of an expert on human
motivation
in large organizations but i don't have
a
degree in anything like that so i won't
make that claim
all right now let's talk about the
question of
is it possible because i think this is a
really important question
if you have the highest motivation in
the world
to cheat and i would argue it is
literally the highest motivation
in the world to cheat and that does
exist
is it possible that's the only other
question because if both of those exist
the highest motivation and it's
practical to do it would you not say
it's guaranteed to happen
i think it would be right so if it
happened
could you detect it and how would you
detect it
for example could you could you observe
it directly
well the complaint is that the observers
were not allowed to observe
and ins in a number of cases there are
no observers
so could you could direct observation
be enough to guarantee that there are no
places that there could be fraud
i think the answer is obviously that's
not enough
direct observation can be good for
plugging
specific holes for example the things
are happening
within the room where you're counting
probably give some direct
observation probably have some cameras
but i don't think there's anybody who
believes
that these alone the cameras and the
direct observation
given how limited that is for the entire
chain of custody
is is there anybody who
drives around behind the the vans
carrying the ballots
does anybody drive behind those vans to
make sure that they you know they don't
stop and unload anything
there must be massive parts of the
process
that are not witnessed by two witnesses
wouldn't you say
how about the recount will the recount
find fraud
no because if the ballots are fraudulent
you would just count them a second time
so there's nobody who believes
my dog's going crazy downstairs i might
have to go deal with that in a minute
nobody believes that a recount finds
fraud
a recount can only find a specific kind
of fraud
such as can you hear that
my dog is going crazy downstairs and
so i either have an intruder or
something
i don't know what's going on down there
but so a recount won't
detect fraud it would only detect a very
specific kind
how about an audit so an audit is more
than a recount
we don't do audits could an audit
find problems in the system i think it
could
but we don't do them we do an audit
in a very small way similar to the irs
if the irs calls you and says we're
going to audit you
do they audit everything that your tax
returns claim
no no even an auditor from the irs
only looks at a certain question they
might say ah
there's a red flag on your return we're
going to look at that question
but they're not going to open up your
entire return i suppose they might if
they saw some
major fraud but that's not the intention
they're looking at just the question
likewise an audit of an election process
at most is going to look at a specific
question
is there anybody who's going to be
double checking the
software line by line in the election
system
no no nobody's going to check the code
that's not happening have you heard that
happening if they don't check
the software have they really done an
audit
not really so i would say that anybody
who tells you there's
something like an election audit
happening
that's more untrue than true it might be
that they've audited
some specific questions doesn't mean
they're auditing everything
how about lawsuits you file a lawsuit
then you've got discovery and you can
really dig into the details
could a lawsuit find your regularities
well it turns out there's a problem
because you can't follow the you can't
file the lawsuit
unless you have evidence and you can't
get evidence
with a recount you can't get it with an
audit
and you can't necessarily get it with
direct observation or cameras
so how can you file a lawsuit if you
don't have any evidence
and you don't have any way to get it
because the system
is not designed to present it it's just
not there
so you can you know you can do things
around the margins
but you would expect to have an uh a
situation
like the trump legal team you'd expect
26
out of 27 lawsuits to be tossed out
because the court says
uh where's your evidence
i can't get it i can't get the evidence
so i can't even get the process started
because they can't get the evidence
but what about data irregularities
do you think you could prove election
fraud
with data irregularities well
maybe and i've been telling you for some
time now
that you would see evidence that would
convince you that there was
fraud the the evidence that i think
would be the convincing stuff
is the data irregularities but
as we saw with the wisconsin tweet that
i talked about
do you trust anybody's data yet
nope you don't almost every claim we've
seen about the election
pretty much every claim has turned out
to be false
and it doesn't even matter who's making
it democrat republican
it feels like just about every claim
about the election has turned out to be
false
so eventually
given time i think the data
irregularities can be found so this is
probably the only place you
could find fraud now if you found it
here that might give you
cause for a lawsuit which might allow
you to dig into things and
you know maybe maybe find something but
the data irregularities we probably will
not find
or at least will not be confident of
until the whole biden process
is done so here's where i think we're
going to be
at some point in the future and i got in
trouble for saying i think it would be
in two weeks
so i'm going to take the deadline away
from it because i got myself in trouble
with a deadline
because i'd just be guessing on deadline
eventually
the data irregularities will make the
case as
convincingly as i think the
kennedy nixon election
and then what do you do then what do you
do
now there's one other phenomenon i
haven't seen anybody talk about
that i'm going to add to the
conversation and it's going to make you
mad and you're going to realize it's
true
let's say there was some evidence
we got 220 sworn statements right
so that suggests that maybe the direct
observation
and the witnesses worked to some degree
so let's say if those 220 they can put
together a dozen good lawsuits
and let's say that they're all pretty
valid you've got a witness
maybe after that you could get some
documentation to demonstrate it's true
maybe the cameras show it too then you
take this to a judge and you say i got
it now
now we found this this
source of a problem let's say we found
that
a nursing home had sent in a hundred
ballots
but none of the actual residents are
aware that they voted
so you say haha gotcha we found that you
use this
senior center to harvest votes you just
took them out of the mailbox you filled
them out yourself and you sent them in
so i'm going to make a lawsuit about
that i'm going to take it to court
gotcha what does the judge say
does the judge say show me your evidence
nope because the judge doesn't care
because the judge first asks you how
many votes are we talking about
and you say well i got a hundred votes
there were a hundred
people who will swear they didn't vote
and yet their vote was registered
and the judge says uh
so what if i overturn 100 votes it
doesn't change the election
get out of here so
if you don't find it all
you can't do anything about it so you
could find
a lot of it but if you only find chunks
of it
here's a chunk here's a chunk
here's a chunk the chunks are worthless
because each chunk doesn't add up enough
to change the outcome
and so the judge says there's nothing to
work on here
yeah i could you could prove that these
hundred votes don't count
but it's just this little chunk doesn't
change anything so i'm not even going to
hear it
so it's sort of a a perfect
situation somebody says that's
appealable yeah i suppose anything's
appealable
um somebody says who here wants to start
a civil war
you know the the thing that uh i
appreciate about this country is that
we're not going to have a civil war this
is not going to happen
and the reason is so simple you know why
we won't have a civil war
don't want one that's it that's the
whole reason
you have to have somebody want one right
nobody wants one even the militias
they're not looking to start one i mean
they may independently want to overthrow
the country or something
but not over the election necessarily uh
i just don't think anybody wants one and
you would have to have
a lot of people wanting one it just
doesn't happen on its own
all right um and i would like to say to
my democrat friends who believe
that orange hitler was the
was a real thing and believe that the
president
is a real racist and suggests
drinking bleach if you could stop that
election and you didn't
you are cowards you're cowards
because if you didn't cheat in this
election you've got a lot of explaining
to do
you should be able to tell me you threw
the election and you're happy about it
because you saved the country in your
opinion saved us from orange hiller
wouldn't you be proud of that well i
would think you would be
all right i think i may have said
everything i want to do oh
[Music]
biden is boring us to death and the only
other thing i want to say about
um oh what a does anybody think that the
senate race in georgia is going to be
a clean election if
if let's say hypothetically
hypothetically if democrats had
rigged the presidential election and now
we're doing this
senate uh special election in georgia
wouldn't they rig that too and wouldn't
they just do it exactly the same way
so we're going to learn something
interesting
because if both republicans lose in
georgia
which is what people are not expecting
it's going to reopen this question of
fraud
and if the democrats cheated
in the the main election and got away
with it
why wouldn't they do it again the same
way
if it works why wouldn't you do it again
really
so james mattis says he hopes biden gets
rid of america first as a concept
to which i say now i see why two
different presidents fired that guy that
guy
mattis was probably the most overrated
general of all times
you know as it turns out i had been a
big fan
but once you hear him speaking candidly
he doesn't seem even bright
there's something there's something
going on there
because if you're an american general
and you don't think america first that
does not preclude
being generous to other countries saying
america first
doesn't mean you screw france
america first doesn't mean you throw
grey britain into the ocean
it means that you operate in a
enlightened
way about self-interest
all right that's all i got for now and
i'll talk to you
tomorrow
all right periscope's off youtubers
you have my full attention
um somebody said great britain is
already in the ocean
okay technically
you need to invite rubber barns
you know he'd be a great interview
robert barnes would be but i'm
now that i'm doing uh live streaming on
two platforms i don't have the
technology to do a guest
that both of you could hear on youtube
and periscope at the same time
um why do the youtubers get more time
with you well
uh no real reason
um how did stacey abrams
become so important by doing a good job
stacey abraham is abrams abrams
right stacy abrams she's doing something
right
i mean she almost became governor and
she's
credited with you know changing the
election situation in georgia
so she's doing something really well
um somebody said i should go in the
megan kelly
show that's a podcast i would uh i'm
taking some time off from
doing podcasts and stuff but she would
be fun
do you think vaccine should be mandatory
uh i don't think that's possible
i don't think it's possible but i do
think that um
it will be effectively mandatory so i
don't think the government needs to do
it
because you saw that qantas already said
you have to have a vaccination to fly on
their airlines
i would expect all the airlines to go
that way
so i think that if you want to operate
in the real world
probably you're going to have to get a
vaccination at some point
but i don't know that the government has
to do it i think commerce alone would do
it
how many hours a day do i work in comics
um maybe an average of
one or two a day but i work on weekends
too
is this the golden age it might be it
might be
you know the coronavirus as horrible as
it was
and is it changed so many things
for the better i think you know it just
forced us to shake the box
and rethink everything so we may be
yeah um
uh
you love how yeah you know the thing the
thing that everybody does
that's an exaggeration not everybody but
a lot of people do
is they pretend that if you're in a
group that you agree with
everything the group has done so while
it's true
that trump supporters have done x
i didn't do x so why do i get blamed
why is it my fault if if i like a
president
and somebody else likes a president and
somebody else kicks a dog
and we both like president trump why is
that my problem
i'm kind of not that person i'm a
different person
2024 candidates well the obvious ones
will be
uh pompeo matt gates i think you'll see
tom cotton maybe rubio
yeah all the usual stuff
um you're going to write another book i
haven't decided yet
i might
um
uh yes all right so i'm reading your
questions and uh it's very boring to
watch me read your
questions so i think i'm done and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
