well today with any luck
we will feature boo the cat
who is below my desk
and licking herself in a most
disgraceful way
well appreciate all the cat pictures
there coming in the comments over on the
locals platform
and good morning youtube too
so uh how would you like today to be
great
yeah you would like that i know
have you noticed that i talk to you as
if you're answering and i can hear you
you do
yeah
i thought you'd notice that
and you notice if i ask you a question
it doesn't even matter what you say
because my answer is going to be the
same anyway right exactly
all right well let's uh enjoy ourselves
to the maximum extent and all you need
is a copper mug rug glass a tanker
jealous or stein a canteen jungle flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee wait you like what
oh okay well that's good too
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
yes i have been called
the mr rogers of
of the internet or something
i have been called that
all right well let's talk about the news
a special shout out to wolf blitzer who
despite having a first name wolf
has never been accused of sexual
harassment as far as we know
i say that only because that over at cnn
don lemon
has some accusations he's dealing with
and chris cuomo has some accusations
he's dealing with and
i just think it's funny that the only
guy named wolf
he's cool
is that his real name
somebody says he made up that name
maybe
but uh
yeah
good for wolf blitzer for staying out of
trouble for all these years
well kamala harris gets the
charlottesville hoax treatment by cnn
and
and some others in the network world
and uh couldn't have happened to a nicer
person and what i mean by that is
you probably saw the story in which uh
she was talking
harris was talking to a classroom
and one of the students asked a question
in which he uh
referred to
israel as being involved in
quote ethnic genocide
now
harris did not push back on that thought
and the thinking was that the lack of
pushing back
kind of like
is almost as good as applauding it
but what she did say
if you listen to her carefully
is she basically applauded the fact that
that this young woman could have an
opinion
that might be different from the
mainstream
and that she could express her opinion
and that that was her truth
what did people hear
they heard that she was agreeing
that
israel was involved in ethnic genocide
which you know
most people would say they're not so
uh
i feel
i feel like uh
harris is getting the charlottesville
fine people hoax treatment
not that she doesn't deserve it i mean
she's she's done enough to you know
to do her own hoaxes but if i'm being
objective
it didn't look to me like she was
agreeing with the idea
now she didn't push back
she didn't push back and that's true
and if you if you were israel
i think you'd have something to say
about that right because you want to you
want to remind people for the next time
you know the next time this comes up
you know what would be cool
you just push back on that a little bit
we wouldn't mind that at all
but the letting it go we don't like that
now did she let it go yeah she didn't
let it go but she let it go with a
specific statement
in favor of freedom of speech of
unpopular ideas
i'm going to give her a pass on that
no i don't think that she was saying
anything about israel i think she was
just
trying to be
you know
i think trying to be flexible and maybe
you know teach a lesson to the young
people
but i didn't hear what the news is
reporting i i listened to the whole
thing twice
i didn't hear her doing anything wrong
and i did not hear her agreeing with the
comment about ethnic genocide i
definitely didn't hear that
right
um
hit the like button you grifter
okay i don't know what that's about
gavin newsom has announced that
california will be the first
to require vaccinations for all children
going to school
he points out that our schools already
have vaccines for measles mumps and more
so why would this be different
well
isn't the reason that this is different
that
it hasn't been around as long
and that's the whole problem right
now no you say oh but those other
vaccinations they've been around forever
so it's safer
but
was that true when they were new
can somebody give me a little history
lesson give me a fact check on this
yeah it's very different
so the fact that it's different is
meaningful right you can't say this is
like everything else it's different
but is it different in the important way
is it different in the sense that
were these other vaccinations had they
been around and tested for let's say
five years
before the first time the public
was required to get them
maybe i mean i'm not doubting it i just
don't know the history
they've had studies right they've had
studies by now
so i understand the point
that if you're talking about today
vaccines that have been around a long
time look safer than one that's new
everybody's on the same page with that
right
everybody would agree with the general
statement
that any kind of medicine that's been
around for a long time is safer
you know just in terms of unknown risks
it's safer it might not be safer
but in terms of unknown risks there are
fewer than we all agree with that
but the question is when those or other
vaccinations were brand new
how long did they wait
before the public got them and how long
did we wait before they were mandatory
for kids
before they could go to school
yeah so the other question is whether
they were required when new yeah that's
a good question too were the other
vaccinations required when they were new
so i'd just like a history lesson if
somebody could give me one or point to a
a link
because the
new sims argument sort of depends on
that doesn't it
it depends on you knowing that history
and i feel like it's a little weasel-ish
because we don't
exactly
um
man so i'm seeing one comment that says
mandatory
vaccinations were usually about 15 years
later
now i don't know if if they waited
for a reason
or they just wasn't being demanded in
schools yet
fda didn't approve what do you mean oh
fda didn't approve well
i don't know i i think the fda didn't
approve
is
not exactly as true as it should be
because i think they did approve it they
just did it on a quicker basis and with
less information maybe
but it's definitely approved
you know saying it's not approved i
don't think that's factually true
it might be approved with less
information now that would be true i
think
um
so what do you think about that
mandatory vaccinations for kids
everybody happy about that
i've got a feeling that this audience is
not too happy about that
yeah well it's going to happen anyway
what happens when we have mandatory
vaccinations for teachers
because that's already true in new york
city right
is it mandatory in new york city i think
mandatory vaccinations for teachers
is kind of
it has to happen right
oh so here's an interesting question
i don't think
newsom can get away with mandatory
vaccinations for kids but not the
teachers
and the staff
what am i missing here
am i missing something did newsome
already say the teachers need
vaccinations i don't think so right or
did he
maybe that's the part i'm missing
um
well what happens when the teachers
unions
in california learn that
they're going to have to have mandatory
vaccinations too are they going to get
them
so it looks like maybe the governor
and the people and the teachers unions
are going to have a little uh issue here
aren't they
right
or is there something i'm missing
wow i'm hearing uh
from a doctor over on locals i just
missed getting a bad polio vaccine that
gave 50 percent of the people polio was
that true back in the early polio
vaccine days
was there a bad version
i i've never heard that story but if
it's true i mean it's coming from a
doctor so i'm guessing it is true
oh i'm seeing a lot of yeses
okay well you can't really even compare
that day and age to today i don't think
i don't think that would be a fair
comparison because you know
here's my guess
my guess
and i could use a fact check on this too
is that our ability to predict what
kinds of things are going to be a
problem in the future is probably better
right
because we've seen enough things in the
past we're like oh it's like that thing
in the past better watch out for that
one
so i don't think you can compare
you know 30 or 50 years ago medicine to
today
i just don't think that's apples and
oranges anymore
anyway
that's happening
what else is happening
in new york city there's a george floyd
statue that just went up
along with two others
also brianna taylor
and john lewis
civil rights hero john lewis
now let me ask you this
let's say you were the family of john
lewis
do you all you all know john lewis uh
died last year was it was it within last
year he died
and uh jet widely considered a hero of
the civil rights movement
right
pretty much
left right center everybody considers
john lewis
a hero american hero
his bust was just put up with
george floyd's
so now they're treated treated about the
same
in terms of
historically important
similar
similar
does that feel good to you
let me say this
as many of you know
the rules about who you identify with or
what your identity is is up to you
everybody agrees with that so far right
you can identify any way you want you
can be gay or straight or non-binary you
can be
whatever ethnicity you want if you
identify that way
and
i like that rule
because i've decided that i will
identify
as a uh white i'm sorry
no forget the white part
uh
as a heterosexual black man
so i identify as a heterosexual black
man because i've lost
several jobs to racial discrimination if
you don't know that story i'm not going
to get into it now but two corporate
jobs i lost
because my boss
in each case told me directly
can't promote you because you're white
and male
right and one tv show because i was
white
so i've been massively discriminated
against
economically
for being white
so i feel like i have a lived experience
of a person who lives in a world in
which they're continuously discriminated
against so i've just decided to identify
as black
one because i can
apparently the rules allow that
and i'm just following the rules and
since i have like some connection
some affinity with that
part of the country
and i also like being on a winning team
[Laughter]
that might be the most defensive part of
what i'm saying
i like being on the winning team
and i feel like
black america is sort of on a winning
streak
at the moment
i mean things are still terrible in so
many ways which is why it's worth you
know it's worth being active in that
area because things are so bad maybe you
can help
but
definitely black america is doing better
right than in the past
although you could argue the 60s they
had more homeownership so i think
there's a little ambiguity on that
but
let me give some advice to
the group that i associate with
i don't feel
like you're doing what you hope to
accomplish
by
putting up statues of
of george floyd
i just don't feel that's the hero that
you want
and i don't have to get into the details
right you know he's
you know
the floyd family
they don't need that
but
it feels like a gigantic mistake in
terms of
branding um so i'll just put that out
there
there's room for disagreement on this
right now i
we do have a history that victims are
sometimes remembered
and it's important it is important to
remember victims but i don't know if you
want to pair the victim with the hero
does that feel right
because john lewis is like
one of the
you know most
impressive heroes
that america's ever produced
and putting him in the same
event with uh george floyd who
was just in the wrong place at the wrong
time doing the wrong stuff i mean the
cops were doing the wrong stuff too
so
but
that just feels like a mistake to me
so i say that as an insider as a as a
proud
heterosexual black man i feel like that
did not help our cause
there was a mass fentanyl
ring bust like 800 dealers got rounded
up
so good job for the dea was it the d.a
yeah i think they did a great job um i
guess they've been
surveilling this network for a long time
and they just rolled up a whole bunch of
them so it sounds like amazing work
congratulations on that
um but i tweeted that fentanyl dealers
should get the death penalty
because they are mass murderers they
just do it statistically
right
it's not less of a murder if you don't
know the name of the person who's going
to get killed
take and i like to use my example of the
las vegas mass murder you know the guy
who shot from the window of the hotel
he didn't know the names of who he was
killing or even which people in the
crowd
statistically he murdered people
definitely
he murdered a bunch of people he didn't
know who they were
and didn't even know which body he was
aiming at exactly he was just sort of
spraying the crowd so is he not guilty
of murder because he didn't
know who is murdering
no
no he's guilty of murder he's just dead
so we can't do anything about it
likewise if you're a fentanyl dealer
if you were let's say a small dealer and
you gave some you know pills to your
friends
well probably that's not exactly like
murdering people
that's taking a you know a bad risk with
your friends and that's probably bad but
suppose it's your job
you're a big old fentanyl dealer and
you're just moving lots of it
and you you know maybe hundreds hundreds
of people are involved with your network
at that point if you've given a fentanyl
product
to hundreds of people
you've killed people
you're a murderer
statistically speaking
if you give fentanyl in pills to
hundreds of people
some of them die and you know that it's
not even a chance
some of them are gonna die
so to me that's just murder
it just is being done in a statistical
sense now what was the pushback i got
from that on twitter
scott scott scott people said
now uh what about uh
people uh
who give you sugar
sugar is killing you
right how about
the fast food companies
they're killing you statistically
speaking
that's a good point right statistically
speaking mcdonald's is murdering
you know what tens of thousands of
people a year
statistically they don't know the names
of their victims
but they're part of the problem so do
you treat them the same mcdonald's and a
fentanyl dealer this is what people were
saying to me on twitter to which i say
you know it does matter if it's legal
right mcdonald's is legal
you know maybe you could argue it
shouldn't be
but it is
it's legal
so you know alcohol
cigarettes
you could argue they shouldn't be legal
and i would listen to that as a separate
argument
but they are legal
you don't put people to death
for doing legal things
you'd have to at the very minimum you'd
have to make it illegal and then we
could have the conversation of whether
they're statistical murderers
but if the state has already said you
can do this
and then they do what the
state says they can do
even if it does kill people
it looks different to me to me that
looks different
but i can see how you might disagree
um today cnn reported nothing
uh is actually something
so how do you turn nothing
into something well let me tell you let
me tell you
uh it's about the infrastructure bill
and i guess biden went and talked to the
democrats
to try to you know try to loosen things
up because it's all
constipated and they can't agree on this
infrastructure bill
and
literally nothing happened
so biden talked to the democrats
nothing happened
how did cnn report
nothing
here's the exact sentence
uh white house officials think the
president accomplished what he wanted to
do on capitol hill oh good okay so here
they're going to explain
what it was he wanted to accomplish and
we'll see that he did it
it says quote remind democrats
of what is at stake
while relieving some of the pressure
that had built up over the last several
days and reiterating his commitment to
passing both pieces of legislation
with that done
officials believe negotiators have a
better environment to be able to push
toward a deal
am i wrong that that's nothing
and they used words to make it sound
like it was something
and listen to this again
there's nothing here
he was supposed to remind democrats of
what is at stake
which democrats didn't know what was at
stake with the infrastructure bill
not only with the bill itself but with
you know what that does with the future
and whether whether failing at it is
good or bad they all understood that
that's the most nothing i've ever seen
in the news
he reminded people of what everybody
obviously knows
but more he did more than that according
to cnn he also
relieved some of the pressure that had
built up
how do you measure that
is there is there like a pressure gauge
on the side of the building
of congress you're like
we're up to 80 pressure
we're going to need to
send biden over here
lower that pressure
this is not a thing
these are just words
that were put in a sentence that were
put in a paragraph
literally nothing happened
[Laughter]
all right
and uh
also uh reminded them of his quote
commitment to passing both pieces of
legislation
what does it mean to say the president
is committed to something
there's no information here
no information at all
all right
let's talk about replacement theory
theory that's in the news
see uh you know that the news likes to
say that uh replacement theory which
i'll explain if you don't know what it
is
um
is being pushed by you know some fox
news hosts like tucker carlson
and that's all
crazy conspiracy theory stuff
now replacement theory is the idea
that
immigration is really about um bringing
in a lot of people from other countries
to
to replace the you know european biased
culture in this country and get more
democrats and
make it a different country
now
how many of you think
that there's somebody who has a plan
like actually oh if we bring in lots of
people will replace all these white
people and we'll get more democrat votes
in the comments how many how many people
think that's literally what's happening
and that and now i'm not talking about
what's happening so much as the
intention
so i'm only talking about the intention
are there people who
are actually talking
out loud but privately
about
replacing all the white people and
making this a different country via
immigration
in the comments i'm seeing both yeses
and notes lots of yeses
this is actually written in books vlad
says
it's actually written in books people
saying let's replace all the white
people
so are the are the people doing it
reading those books
and and taking that opinion i'm sure i'm
sure that the idea of it is in books
i wouldn't doubt that
but
is that why people are doing it is that
why
is nancy pelosi do you think that nancy
pelosi has meetings with people and
they're like all right don't tell
anybody
but what we're trying to do
is to get fewer people like me nancy
pelosi
that's that's the goal
we want fewer people like me and my
family
is nancy pelosi having that conversation
because the country would be better if
there are fewer people like me
is she saying that
i'm seeing a lot of yeses
i'm not i'm not saying she is or not i'm
just looking at your comments
okay a lot of people think that nancy
pelosi wants to replace herself
and her family with other people
in addition to replacing all the other
white people
so that's what a lot of people think
that's literally what's happening
aoc
so he says aoc wants to replace all the
or replace white people with more brown
people
well
here's my
advice
um
we never really know what people's
intentions are
we think we do
i always say never that's too absolute
but we're often wrong about that
probably more often wrong than right
when it comes to these edge cases
and
here's what i think to me it looks like
politicians are too short-term thinkers
in order to believe replacement theory
you'd have to believe that our
politicians are long-term thinkers
do you believe
that do you believe that our politicians
are thinking past the next election or
two
i don't see evidence of that
um
to me it just looks like politicians are
doing what their current constituents
want them to do
because they think that will win votes
do you need to be more complicated than
the fact that
immigration is popular with democrats
and so democratic leaders want to give
their people what what they're asking
for
because there are a lot of you know
hispanic
democrats
who
would like immigration to get their
family in etc and there are enough
people who simply sympathize with that
point of view
that
isn't it just normal leadership to give
people what they want and do you think
the voters are thinking that do you
think do you think the
the hispanic americans or latin you know
the
latinx or whatever name you want to put
on it today
do you think that they're thinking oh if
we if you let my relatives in
i get to replace some more white people
i kind of doubt it
i i feel like it's being driven by the
public
not by the politicians
and the the politicians are simply
responding to the public you know being
favorable about immigration
to me that's all it looks like now
is there anybody who would say out loud
on the democrat side
that there might be a side effect or a
benefit which is it changes the voting
patterns especially in say texas
and especially in florida
probably they're happy about that to
have more voters but i i think i feel
that that's a little too long term for
them to really be making decisions on it
i think that that's just a side benefit
that they get along with making their
voters happy at the moment
so that's my take my take is that they
only care about the next election ish
but they don't mind
that it might have a long-term benefit i
thought but i don't think that's the
intention
so much as something they don't mind you
know that does work in their favor
i saw an argument in
on the cnn opinion piece
that
the worst thing that could happen to the
people afraid of
replacement theory is to get what they
want
you know you've heard the
be be afraid of getting what you want
you know that could be a problem
and if there are a bunch of white people
who are afraid of replacement theory
suppose they got their way suppose we
just stopped immigration
and they got their way
first of all the white majority would
disappear anyway because the
demographics are going to make that
happen
so it would just take longer you know
the replacement would still happen just
take a little longer
and
you that's the only way to get young
people
because the white population is not
having as many children
so the only way you could have a country
that works in the long run as far as we
know i mean maybe robots and ai will
change everything but at the moment the
only way we know to have a prosperous
country in the long run
is to have more young people
how do you get the young people unless
you bring them in because the the older
white people are just
not having babies
so
the second thing you have to look at is
the degree of
of let's say mixing
now i don't know if you see as much of
it as i do because i live in california
so california is
you know
not counting new york city maybe is just
one of the most
melting pottiest places you could ever
be i mean there's a little of everything
if you if you go to a house party in
california
there's just every combination of
everybody
simply virtue signaling yeah maybe maybe
it is just for juicing
but here's you know what movie was it
bull durham or something uh that the
thought was everybody would just have
sex until everybody was brown
it was just it'll all take care of
itself in the long run
something like that's kind of going to
happen in the long run
uh
you know the the number of uh
of kids in california who are some
mixture of whatever
is pretty high
you know yeah you you have uh if your
kids have their friends over
you've got a little of everything right
it's just a little bit of everything
so
um we might just
uh have sex to the point where the whole
racial thing just doesn't make as much
sense anymore oh bolworth bulworth sorry
not bull durham the movie was bullworth
thank you
all right worldwide uh the covenant
deaths
have reached 5 million it is being
reported do you believe that
do you believe that 5 million people
have died worldwide from covet
and that half of them i think half of
them came in the united states
what's wrong with
that what's wrong with these two
statistics five million deaths
and half of them were in the united
states
does that make sense to you
you don't think half of them were in
india
maybe
well you know if it's true that india is
under counting their deaths by you know
a factor of five or ten or god knows
um
i've got a feeling that five million
reported deaths is really 20 billion
give me a give me a guess what you think
if the if the official reported number
is 5 million deaths worldwide
what do you think just your intuition or
your skepticism or your distrust just
your hunch what do you think is a real
number
i'm seeing a lot of people going lower 1
million 1 million so you would be the
people who would say it's not so much
the covet it was the comorbidities and
the way we're counting it and you know
we're throwing everything in that
category
well i would say that at the very least
the different countries are not counting
it the same
and some can't count it at all because
they just don't have the good enough
records
so
my intuition tells me that if everybody
counted the way we did
it would be closer to 20 million
but if we counted the way other
countries do
it might be closer to a million
so i think it has to do with how you
count it right
i don't think it's a million or 20
million it's just how you count it i
think you can get to either number
all right
so we don't trust much about statistics
and we should not
uh here's a little story about my own
confirmation bias
now confirmation bias as you know is
when you see something that agrees with
you and you're like oh that looks
accurate
that is totally accurate because it
happens to agree with you that's the
reason you think it's accurate
here's mine
the story is that there's a new study
that is looking at the correlation
between vitamin d3
and mortality from covet
and the thinking is that
the more vitamin d3 you have the less
chance of dying up to the point of maybe
close to zero
that you could actually bring the death
rate close to zero
if everybody had enough d3 now here's
what seems to be new
and by the way this is not yet a
reliable study
so what i'm going to say next
should not be deemed as reliable
hasn't gone through peer review blah
blah blah
but
it's new information and i certainly
doubt that you could have enough vitamin
d to bring the death rate to zero that
doesn't sound uh
we don't really live in a world where
that's possible
you can't bring anything to zero
but
i guess what they added was some extra
analysis to
support the idea that the d3 is the
cause of the better outcomes or worse as
opposed to just a correlation
because the problem is that people who
are sick almost always have low vitamin
d3
and the people who die of covet are the
people who already have some
comorbidities
so it's guaranteed
just based on the fact that you know
those two facts is guaranteed that a lot
of people with covet would also have low
vitamin d but it could be a coincidence
because they were sick from other things
what this study purports to find is that
it is cause causal
and not
hey say hi to boo she's
look around
by the way
could i give you some good news
it's good news for me
but i'm hoping that you know you
followed along enough
to
to feel some goodness in him
yesterday
for the first time in two weeks
boo ate solid food
now the feeding tube's still in because
just to give medicines and stuff it's
just a little convenience so leave it in
a little bit longer
but just yesterday yesterday late
afternoon she she took some bites of
food
and then a little bit later as well
and
in my little life
that's a really big deal
it's a really big deal
now she's not out of the woods she's got
some extra tests
they have to
still rule out some nasty stuff that's
still possible
but they're trying to rule that out but
at the moment
that's uh
let me bring her over here for
a think she's coming this way
boo wants to say hi boo come here
there we go
so here's a little feeding tube it goes
into a hole that they put in her neck
and that goes through the neck and it
goes to the top of the stomach so she
doesn't really feel the food going in
except
she knows it's happening
so she's lost a lot of weight she's a
little skinny now but she knows where
her food is we're gonna make sure she
has some as soon as we're done
all right i think i was talking about
something else besides my cat oh yeah
confirmation bias well so the reason
this
vitamin d3 thing is confirmation bias is
because early in the pandemic
i was one of a number of people i'm not
the only person who said this but i was
kind of out in front of the vitamin d3
thing saying
why does it look to me like there's a
correlation between the countries that
have the best vitamin d
and the people who have the best vitamin
d and the best outcomes of course
that was probably just correlation not
causation but
because i was saying that publicly and
early
i see a study like this and what do i
say oh that's probably true
right
because you see a study that agrees with
what you put yourself on the line as
saying
you're going to believe that
so i'm trying so what i'm trying to put
across
is that i i'm biased to believe this is
true
but i'm also aware of the fact that my
bias might be the only reason i think
it's true because if this were a
pre-print study on anything else what
would i be telling you
don't believe it
if it was on any other topic but just
happens to agree with me so
you know in my mind it looks a little
bit better all right here's the most
provocative point of the day
so lately you've seen a bunch of rogue
doctors that's my name for it rogue
doctors who are doing videos and you see
them in memes and stuff in which they're
doubting the mainstream opinion
here's my general question
how likely
in general not just talking about covet
but talking about all things you've ever
seen
how often is the rogue doctor
right
going against the mainstream in the
comments how how often
if the only thing you know is that
there's a doctor saying hey hey people
you're getting it wrong everything's
wrong
how often do they end up being right in
your experience now this is just
the feel of it the experience
i'll read out some of your numbers i'm
seeing everything from one percent to 75
50 50. you're all over the board
100
um
you rarely hear a follow-up from the
real good doctors good point
uh somebody says they're right about
ivermectin that's what somebody says
here
all right i'll tell you my um
i'll tell you my
view of it
i think the rogue doctor
is right maybe five percent of the time
now that says nothing about any specific
rogue doctor you're looking at right
maybe maybe
my cat is making a bed out of my
papers here so it's gonna get a little
crinkly
um now i know what you're thinking
you're you're already sending me the
names of specific doctors and specific
cases
so
here's a check on your thinking
if during this conversation you said to
yourself yeah yeah i get your point
but not this specific doctor
check your thinking or if you said yeah
yeah scott i get your point as a general
statement but certainly not with
ivermectin
if you said that
just check your thinking
right
doesn't mean you're wrong
you could be right
you know the rogues are sometimes right
right
all right 100 of pioneers are rogue
thank you that was exactly the point i'm
going to make next how do you square the
fact
that the rogue doctors in some sense
seem wrong a lot
whatever you think is a lot
but it's the same token
by the same token
every single thing that ever changed
from wrong to right in science
probably started with one person a rogue
scientist a rogue doctor right
does that change my point
so does that does that change the
statistics
of how often the rogue doctor is right
no not even a little bit
well maybe a little bit but not enough
to matter
both are true
both can be true and they don't conflict
it is only the rogue doctor
who changes the big things in science
that would go from wrong to right
somebody goes first and when they do
they're the rogue
einstein was a rogue scientist right he
said things that others weren't on board
with until they were
but it's really rare
right the reason that uh that is
the reason that newton isaac newton is
famous
very rare
very rare
so
i'm not saying that the rogue doctor is
always wrong
as soon as you imagine it as an absolute
it's just nonsense of course
all absolutes
i almost said all absolutes are nonsense
i won't even finish that sentence you
know what i mean um
so yeah you could have all of your
breakthroughs come from the rogue doctor
at the same time only one percent of
rogue doctors turn out to be right do
you get that
that's just that one point was everybody
on board
can be true that every breakthrough is a
rogue doctor
and also true
that only one percent it ever works
right i'm not saying those are the
percentages i'm just saying they could
be true
there would be no conflict between those
those that data
so i would say this
every time you see a rogue doctor
doubting science your first impulse
should be probably not true
now keep an eye on it because it's going
to be one of these rogue doctors who
gets it right right
probably
there's got to be at least one rogue
doctor who's getting it right i'm not
saying they're all wrong by any means
but i'm saying that your first instinct
should be probably wrong
and then you know maybe you look into it
maybe or maybe you modify your opinion
after you've looked into it but you
should start with
probably wrong that that's your best
defense against being taken in by
uh
very persuasive people now why is it
that the rogue doctors are so persuasive
tell me why are rogue doctors so
persuasive in the comments tell me why
what is it about them
that makes them persuasive
and it's not just one thing it's a few
things
confirmation bias thank you that is one
of the things i'm looking for if you
believed what the rogue doctor is saying
you are susceptible to thinking oh it's
confirmed now
but it's just confirmation bias right so
that's the first thing that your
confirmation bias will work just the way
mine did with vitamin d3
i want it to be true so i can be right
so you hear the rogue doctor and he says
exactly what you were suspecting
boom he must be right because he said
exactly what i suspected well your
suspicions don't really have much
credibility
and neither does the rogue doctor
somebody says their reasoning good
that's exactly what i was looking for
the rogue doctors are
persuasive
because they have excellent reasoning
and credible data
right
everybody agree with that the reason
that they're persuasive
is they have
what looks like credible data you don't
know if it's right but it's credible
and
real good explanations that make sense
to you
so that's why they're persuasive
do you know who else is persuasive in
that way
everybody who's wrong
everybody who's wrong
they're persuasive in exactly the same
way because if you only hear one side of
an argument and somebody's smart
you know doctors are pretty smart
it'll sound persuasive it has nothing to
do with how true it is
the level of persuasiveness
of one person talking and making their
point without the counterpoint
should be
zero the level of credibility you should
give any person when you haven't heard
the counterpoint
is zero
if you give them higher than zero you're
really doing it wrong again it doesn't
mean they're wrong that doctor could
turn out to be the right one
but
on moment one
the first exposure to it
doctors saying something that other
people are not saying and no
counterpoint
shown at the same time no pushback shown
give that zero credibility
keep an open mind
and maybe look into it more and keep
watching the topic but at the start it
should be zero
about a lot of you started 100
am i right
do a lot of you started 100
you hear him and he's like convincing us
hell
you say damn it that agrees with just
what i suspected
done
convinced
i think you're starting at 100 when you
start at zero percent now the the real
number might be somewhere in between in
terms of credibility
but don't start at 100 and try to move
backwards
start at zero
and see if you can move up
that would be good hygiene for keeping
yourself out of trouble right
all right
rogue doctors
um
here's something that uh erica said
erica you watching
good morning erica
um erica said on twitter a little
pushback to this point it's a it's a
good pushback so and watch my response
to it she says
oh
i forgot a part i added the following
rule
that if you know the name of the rogue
doctor
they're almost certainly not right
doesn't mean they're always wrong
remember there are no absolutes here but
statistically speaking if you can think
of the name of the doctor
i'm going to say that doctor will be
proven wrong why
why
give me in the comments why i'm saying
that this will be a good test because
this is this is a
this is a call back to a principle that
i've talked about a few times
why doesn't why does the fact that you
as a consumer knowing the name of the
doctor
why does that make it the least likely
it's true
because it's a weird name no
court cases one no
more interested in being famous than
right
i hadn't thought of that but maybe
that's not a bad comment
it's not where i was going because their
egos maybe
might be part of it that's not where i'm
going
all right
uh none of you got it
looks like none of you got it
it's the uh
it's the theory
about what makes news
what makes news
what is it that makes news
things that aren't true
things that aren't true is what get your
attention
things that are true don't stick in your
mind
they're just well that's true
just
it's gone but things that are outrageous
and crazy
and also not true
stick in your mind
does anybody forget that president trump
once suggested people drink bleach
you all remember that don't you
is there anybody who follows politics
who doesn't know that story
why do you know it
why do you know that story
because it's not true
it's the not true part
that makes you remember it because
there's something about the story that
doesn't make sense
like you're like really
you did that
i mean it feels like they have evidence
and people are saying it and but it
doesn't make sense
right
this principle will blow your mind if
you haven't heard it before
the thing that makes a thing news
is also the thing that makes it not true
right those those are so paired
that what makes it news is that it's not
true think of all the things that were
news russian collusion
[Music]
the russians paying
the taliban to kill americans
your hair is on fire right
charlottesville fine people hoax
these are the ones you remember
and it's because it's a dog bites man
stories
i'm sorry it's man bites dog stories
if you hear the dog bites a person
you're like you don't remember it
because it's normal but if you hear a
man bites a dog
you remember that that's unusual
so it's the
it's the unusualness and the provocative
nature of the claim
that makes you know the name of the
doctor
because it becomes news
because the news and especially social
media say man this is good stuff
this is good stuff we're going to put
this in the headline
so
it doesn't guarantee that the person is
wrong so i'm not saying that i'm not
saying that if you know the doctor's
name that means they're wrong all right
classic examples would be
you know it could be a doctor that you
already knew from another reason you
know dr drew you knew dr drew from other
reasons so this has nothing to do with
this example right but if the only
reason you heard of a doctor
is because of their rogue contrarian
views
just start as zero
then
try to work your way up from zero by
being aware that it's an issue and maybe
look into it but start at zero
all right um erica said a little
pushback
about the fact that if you know the name
of the doctor they're probably wrong uh
erica says my guess would come from
watching rand paul be right in the long
run
only time will tell us if the mandate
crumbles and blah blah
do you believe that has rand paul been
proven right
or has rand paul been proven wrong now i
would say that he's more like dr drew
because we know rand paul from other
reasons right so he's famous not for his
rogue opinions but let's just talk about
him for a moment because it's an
interesting comment and thank you for
that erica
i think that was additive
um
is rand paul right
that if you have natural immunity
you don't need a vaccination that's
that's sort of his main thing right
is he right
he's a rogue
doctor
and he's saying that if you have the
vaccination you don't need i'm sorry if
you have natural immunity
you don't need the vaccination
is he right
nope
he's not
he's not
because every uh as far as i know every
study
has shown that if you get the
vaccination on top of natural immunity
you have the best immunity of all
and the best immunity is
better than average immunity isn't it
give me a fact check in real time here i
need a fact check here's my claim
now remember this is not exactly what
rand paul is saying if i if i interpret
rand paul correctly he's saying that
natural immunity should be good enough
to have your full rights the same way a
vaccinated person does that's a
different argument
if if rand paul is arguing the political
philosophical nature of things then i
agree with him completely
hear this clearly
rand paul as a politician
arguing that natural immunity should be
seen as good as vaccination totally
agree
totally agree with him good point and he
makes it well
but
medically speaking
medically speaking we do know
that a person with natural immunity will
have more immunity with a vaccination
did you know that
how many of you were aware of that that
your antibodies would be way better
if you had natural immunity plus one
vaccination shot
i'm saying not true
those of you say not true
uh go go google it when we're done
i think you'll find that it's accepted
as true now
and look at
ian martis he did a study on it
you can follow him on twitter as well
and
that's what i believe that his results
showed the same
i don't think there's any
i don't think there's any study
that says if you get a vaccination on
top of natural immunity
that it doesn't help
if you can find that send it to me but i
don't think that exists
okay
so is rand paul right or is he wrong
is he fighting the right fight
again
if he's fighting it for political
philosophical reasons absolutely is
right in my opinion because really it's
just an opinion but i agree with him
completely that the people with natural
immunity need their freedom
do we all agree with that can i get a
100 agreement
that from a social
legal perspective
you know what's right about freedom in
america
that if you've got natural immunity and
you can maybe you have to prove it right
with the test but if you've got it
that you should have all of your freedom
all of your freedom no exceptions in
terms of the virus
yeah so he's 100 right
but medically i think he's leaving out a
fact
medically he's leaving out i think a
fact that you'd be a little bit more
protected with the shot
now
what if you've got natural immunity
and you don't want to take a risk of a
shot
should you have the right
to not take the extra risk no matter how
small it is it's your it's your body
do you have the right to not get that
extra extra protection
i say yes you do have that right
and i think
you'll all agree really
all right here's another uh
um
little data point that i was not aware
of
so every time i find out something
important
that i wasn't aware of i'd like to pass
that along because i figure other people
may be in the same boat
you've heard of course about the problem
of myocarditis in teens
and there have been
let's see
like 9 million teens have been
vaccinated so far something like that
so let's say there are 9 million teens
have been vaccinated how many have died
from the myocarditis
now carditis myocarditis how many
teens in the united states have died
from myocarditis
in the comments
some mercedes doesn't matter that's a
good question it doesn't matter i'm
seeing three
one zero zero
who says zero it's like the biggest
story in the country
and you think zero people have died from
it and we're making it the biggest story
in the country
300 somebody says
um
all right let me tell you how many
people
got myocarditis and the 9 million it was
like 400 something
all right so knowing that 400 people
got the symptoms
how many of the 400 died
the answer is zero
the answer is zero
and that
basically every one of them is better in
a day because they know how to treat it
they're better in a day
so he says i know somebody who died
were they a teen
a myocarditis
so
yeah yeah we always have to question the
statistics but at the moment it looks
like it hasn't killed anybody now um
none were fatal now that doesn't mean
that they weren't damaged right
i'm not saying you shouldn't worry about
it
you know if i get
trust me if i get myocarditis after
after a vaccination
i'm going to be pretty pissed
i'm sorry i'm gonna be pretty mad
and i'm gonna you know wish i hadn't and
all that
so yeah it's a big deal
but keep it in context
right it's a big deal but maybe not as
big as you thought
still important
all right um
that is just about everything i wanted
to talk about today
scott you might be dead it's nasty stuff
um maybe yeah at my age it'd probably be
a lot more dangerous huh
um
that's exactly what scott's saying he's
trying to backpedal right now
watch him why and watch his hands
see ellen what am i back battling on
you know most of the criticism that i
get on this topic and others
falls into the category of somebody
imagined i used to say something
different and now i'm changing my mind
you have a natural instinct for bayes
theorem okay
um
how much fentanyl does your iphone
subsidize
so you're going only after those chinese
companies you're not a shareholder
oh so i've answered this question and
i'll answer it again it's a fair
question
so
as you know i'm uh i'd like to decouple
our business from china and i would like
us to buy
the fewest amount of chinese-made goods
that we can
but i have an iphone
and you know
pretty much half of my environment is
chinese goods
so how do i how do i explain that
and the way i explain it is quite easily
you do practical things
and you don't do impractical things
that's it
who would disagree with the following
statement
you should do things that are practical
and also good
but you should not do things that are
impractical
even if hypothetically they were
practical they'd be good
it is practical to prevent new business
from going to china very practical
it is not practical
to uproot companies that are gigantic
parts of the american economy
and
at the moment they require you know
let's say assembly in china
so i don't judge apple and tesla by the
same standard i would judge some company
that decided to open a new factory there
tomorrow all right so i've never put
them in the same category
so no matter how many times you ask me
am i comfortable with my iphone i'm
always going to give you the same answer
no
no i'm not comfortable with it one bit
but it isn't practical to change it
quickly
might be practical in the long run and i
hope and i hope and i trust
i trust apple's actually doing that by
the way i trust that they're looking at
their options and trying to figure out
you know what to do
but
you know the way to build it in the
united states is probably with robots
not people so it's not like it's going
to boost employment if they move it over
here but at least get it out of china
i'm being a little too nice to apple and
tesla well
nice isn't really
an operative
thing here and by the way i should say
as i've said before i do own stock
in both apple and tesla
now one of the reasons i own stock with
them is that they're they're just
monsters
they're both just monsters
and
uh when i invest in things it's not
because i love them
i don't invest in things i love
i invest in things that look like they
can't possibly lose money because
they've got some kind of monopoly like
control of things or they're doing
something right
so investment is not about
what is right or wrong
nice means gullible
well what exactly would be the example
of what i'm gullible about
do you think it's practical for them to
just pull out
you wouldn't have a phone
do i owned a dilbert desk calendar same
problem
yeah the the even my products the
dilbert desk calendars are printed in
china now
am i happy about that
nope do you know where the other places
you can print a dilbert calendar are you
know economically
neither do i
have no idea i have no idea where we
where we go but it's also
by
preference and by contract i don't make
those decisions
so the decisions on where the
publisher
prints is out of my
company's control
uh coinbase hr policy is better than
okay i don't know what that means
try india
i wonder why india doesn't have more
manufacturing
actually can somebody answer that
question
why is it that india with you know
massive amounts of potential employment
and you know pretty good education
system and all that
um somebody says they do textiles but
why isn't india just massively competing
with china because wouldn't you give all
of your business to india
if you had a choice same price
indian manufacturer or chinese you would
take indian every time wouldn't you
because they're they're an ally
in a way
the electric grid somebody says they
can't do manufacturing because they're
electric grid i don't know
uh
that's
interesting point but i don't know i
mean china's got problems with their
electric grid they do it
lack of natural resources
i don't know i they could do assembly
so assembly would still work
this
vlad says scott so much basic stuff you
don't know just like in the case of
narcissist
how can i send information to you well
vlad you are a narcissist
uh so i don't want to hear a
thing from you actually
you sound like a jerk
um
now if you could find a way
to like be less of a
flaming jerk
and i'm always interested in seeing
things that don't agree with my opinions
um
would india have been better off had
they stayed part of the british empire
that's not a fair question
people need their freedom too
all right how do you value that
tata makes more cars than any other is
that
true tata is bigger than gm that's an
indian car company i didn't know that
well
then
india has really low quality and the
regulations are insane are you telling
me that china doesn't have insane
regulations
it doesn't seem like anything they can't
solve
why not come down on mexico for fentanyl
are you kidding
i'm being asked why i don't come down on
mexico for the fentanyl
apparently you've not watched me for
very long
i i'm in favor of droning the cartels
can i be any harder than that i'm in
favor of killing the
top fentanyl dealer in china
where he lives in china and even telling
china we did it
i don't know i wouldn't even keep it a
secret
and now we probably couldn't use a drone
in china
but if we could find out you know some
way to kill that guy and just say look
china we gave you we give you a year
we gave you his name his address
all the evidence of the crime and we
gave you a year to fix it
and then we kill them
and we'll do it again
you know we shouldn't have any apology
for that
likewise with the cartels
if we decide to just drone the cartels
for because of the drug business
i'm okay with that
is that hard enough
is murdering them where they stand not
not strong enough for you
all right um
drone attack the ceo of mcdonald's well
again
uh they're illegal products
uh you think trump was angling toward
india as a replacement for china well
yes
certainly in a strategic sense
why doesn't america have quick detection
covent strips
i'm afraid to tell you the answer to
that question because i think i know it
it's corruption
i i don't know the details
but i would be i would place a large bet
that if you dug down into the approval
process of quick cova tests
you would eventually find somebody with
a pharmaceutical connection
that's a problem
so
that that's all i'm going to say
because we don't have any explanation
for why we haven't done it
right
because you would hear an alternate
explanation unless it was corruption you
would hear an ultimate explanation oh
these these rapid test strips they have
a problem or we'd love to make them but
we can't get the precursors or we'd love
to make them but we don't have the
manufacturing capacity or we'd love to
make them but it's not as good as you
think or we'd love to make them but
they're not as safe or it caused some
other problem
have you heard anything like
that
no
nope you haven't and if you haven't
heard any reasonable counter argument
and you haven't you've heard no
counterargument it's got to be
corruption
process of elimination
if you know it's a good thing
it's public the public knows it's a good
thing i mean a lot of us do
it's it's been promoted
there's been testimony to congress
people have told them exactly why it's
good there's zero argument on the other
side and doesn't happen
it's got to be corruption there's no
there's no explanation left
and has the media looked into it
have you seen any stories by a major
media entity
saying we looked into why the u.s
doesn't have rapid tests and here's what
we found
if you've seen that send it to me
because i don't think i've seen it you
know the dog that's not barking
the dog that's not barking
is a story about why we don't have those
test strips
now i know i know that in the beginning
we had some crappy regular tests
pcr tests or whatever but that's a
different story
that those tests have nothing to do with
what we're talking about the rapid tests
the reason we don't have those and other
countries do
it's not money it's not resources it's
not intelligence it's not data
it's not policy
it's nothing
literally we have not been told
why we had why we didn't do it
and are still not doing it as scale that
would make sense
it's got to be corruption
do you have another theory
because if it's not corruption they
would tell us the other reason
right
anyway i think i think we have to assume
corruption to force the government to
communicate
correctly
if the only problem is they haven't
communicated their objection
well that's a big problem
right they need to communicate that
objection so we can know we have
some trust in our government right now
you have to assume no trust
and you have to assume
corruption
that's got to be the default assumption
and i'd love to be talked out of it that
ideally would get talked out of it
not seeing it happen
all right
that is my show for today sorry there
was too much covert stuff in there i
know i tried to leave it to the end but
there wasn't much happening otherwise
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
