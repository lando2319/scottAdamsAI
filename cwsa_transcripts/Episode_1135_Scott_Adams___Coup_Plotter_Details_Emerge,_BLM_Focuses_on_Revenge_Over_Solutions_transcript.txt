[Music]
put your phones on silent
because that's how good this is going to
be
yeah better than even a normal coffee
with scott adams
we're talking one of the best of all
time
i don't even know what i'm going to say
yet but i feel that confident
hello out of you too and before we get
going
would anybody like to do a thing called
the simultaneous sip you know you do
all you need is a copper margaret glass
of tanker tails or steiner canteen joker
flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now for the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes
everything better it's the unparalleled
pleasure
of the simultaneous hip and it happens
now go
well according to jack posabic
this this podcast is better when you
play it at 1.5
times speed which is
both insulting and totally true
i do the same thing if you haven't if
you haven't at least
experimented with listening to podcasts
at
higher speeds you really want to check
it out
so i don't know if periscope has that
option but i put it on
on youtube later and it's also on
podcasts later so you can
listen to it that way or you can listen
to it on the locals.com
subscription site all right so let's
talk about some stuff
i like looking at the interesting ideas
that entrepreneurs come up with
for dealing with the coronavirus
situation
and the alamo draft house which is a
series of
i guess movie theaters they might be in
texas and they haven't came up with an
idea
of letting people rent out the whole
theater
and just take people in there that are
your own friends
so you basically for 150 dollars for the
theater
and other 150 dollars for popcorn and
food or whatever
you you and your friends can just have
the whole theater for uh for a movie
not bad i don't know if it's the best
idea in the world
you know my town has outdoor uh movie
theaters now they're they're doing
drive-ins
and such but i like the creativity of it
it was a good idea
um so
so president trump signed an executive
order essentially saying that
pre-existing conditions would be covered
but of course it's a non-binding
executive order
now let me ask you this how much
is a nine non-binding
promise if you will to uh
to maintain um so to make sure the
pre-existing conditions
are covered would you trust
a president who made a promise like that
and said
i'm going to cover the pre-existing
conditions don't worry about it
do you trust that president well here's
the thing
one of the things that president trump
has done right
is he's done such a good job at doggedly
pursuing
the promises that he's made that it is
completely credible
now nothing in this world is guaranteed
but in terms of whether
president trump would stick to his
promise
of fighting to keep the uh the
pre-existing conditions covered
i feel as though he created that asset
meaning that if you ask me four years
ago i'd say well
i don't know you know politicians make
promises
sometimes they keep them sometimes they
have a reason not to
read my lips no new taxes well changed
my mind
so four years ago i would have said
i don't think you could be positive that
this president or any other president
would keep a campaign promise
but now we've watched him operate for
four years
it seems really clear to me that the
president puts a very high value
on doing what he says he'll do wouldn't
you agree
now he puts a very low value on being
specifically accurate on details and
you know he uses hyperbole and he fails
the fact checking
and it's abundantly clear that he's not
concerned
whatsoever about getting those details
right
now you can hate that or you can love it
but anybody can observe that
you know you no matter which side you're
on we're observing the same thing
he puts a very low value on those little
niceties and the details and
and being technically accurate he does
try to be
directionally accurate in other words
he's he's trying to
persuade the country in a productive
direction there's nothing evil about it
but but when it comes to keeping a
promise
even if he can't get it done as quickly
as he wants or can't get it done at all
you know such as you know building
building the wall
it's slow but it's happening so you can
tell he's at least putting the full
measure of effort into it and i feel
as though the president created this
asset out of nothing
he created an asset of believability
when it comes to keeping his campaign
promises
which is unique i'm not sure every every
president had that exactly
you know you always had the you can keep
your doctor if you want it
situations but i don't know that
trump has any of those if you look for
something like that in trump
and fact-check me on this i might be
just missing something that i'm not
thinking
that would be obvious to you but
i know that a critic would say well what
about the part about
making mexico pay for the wall and i
would say
i don't think anybody took that too
seriously
i mean sure that was a campaign theme
etc
you could say it was a promise but was
it
was it really did the people who voted
for him say yeah i think he means that
he's totally going to get mexico to pay
for that wall
now you could argue that he did get them
to pay for the wall you know
indirectly in terms of uh keeping the
keeping the migrant groups from coming
across
so he did get a lot done in terms of
transferring some of the cost
to mexico that really happened
but nobody took that too seriously it
wasn't a requirement i don't think
all right moving on um
so i think i understand finally because
of the new revelations coming out
about the uh the coup attempt the russia
collusion
coup where uh brennan and comey and
all those characters apparently
if we are to believe the documents we're
seeing
i don't know how to interpret them other
than
a confirmation that there was literally
a coup attempt
i don't know how else to interpret it
and and
i really really tried hard in the
beginning of this
russia collusion stuff when when people
who were
you know even more skeptical than i am
if that's possible
we're saying hey from the very beginning
people were saying
hey this looks like just a coup attempt
it looks like some kind of organized
coup
and i said if you remember i said no
let's you know let's cool down that talk
i don't quite see any evidence of a coup
sure lots of people didn't like the
president
there there are people in jobs and they
can do little things that
make his life hard but it's not some
kind of
organized understood you know
explicit coup attempt i mean that's just
crazy
except that apparently it was
apparently it was exactly that it wasn't
even
sort of like that it wasn't suggestive
of that it wasn't reminding you of that
it was actually that from
based on the documents so we've seen
especially the ones that just came out
now if you understand that and you
understand that the latest documents
are a little bit more damning to both
obama
and biden meaning that apparently if
we're to believe what we see
in the documents it looks like
president obama was pretty deeply
involved in
something that looks exactly like a coup
attempt
and that means that biden was involved
because he you know he was in the room
he would have had to know about it now
here's the thing
how do you explain that i i feel as if
you would agree with us
the following uh supposition that the
the leaders and the important people in
the democratic party
they could kind of get anybody nominated
they wanted
don't you think don't you think that the
you know the
the old clinton crowd and the obama
crowd and the deep state you know the
democrats
don't you think that the leadership of
the party
could kind of push things in whatever
direction they wanted in terms of the
nominee
and you might have asked yourself well
if that's the case
and they could make sort of anybody they
wanted the nominee
by you know controlling the media for
one thing they can control the media
coverage
they can control the funding probably
they can control which
advisors work for whom etc so
if you take uh my assumption
that the people in charge do have the
ability to
create the nominee they want essentially
manipulating the voters into voting for
who they want
why would they choose biden because
by any measure he's the least capable
candidate who has ever run for president
i don't think you could find somebody
who is
less capable than biden it's it's
certainly not
missing their their gaze
that they they're running an incompetent
that's pretty obvious at this point
so why would they do it and the answer
is
to protect themselves biden is the only
person who is
in the in the race for the nomination
he's the only one who had the following
quality
he was just as guilty as the as the
other people in the party
he's part of presumably this is the
speculation right
my speculation uh i think they needed
him
because he's both controllable and he
has the same risk profile as they do
so you could count on him to to make all
the investigations go away
because he had the same risk i don't
think there was anybody else in that
category was there
anybody else who would be as good as
stooge as
as biden to keep them out of jail
so now when i say stuff like this
you you should be saying to yourself
well that's just about the biggest story
i there's never been a bigger story than
this watergate was a peanut compared to
this
um what was as big as this
that monica lewinsky no tiny tiny little
problem
there's nothing that i can think of in
modern you know at least my lifetime i
can't think of
anything except maybe the you know
getting into the
iraq war the wrong way with bad
information
but this has got to be gigantic enormous
biggest story of all time so let's look
at the cnn home page
and see how they're carrying you see how
they're
covering the biggest story in the
history of the united states
um let's see nothing
nothing
nothing now
have you ever seen them just not cover a
story
usually they'll at least put a line in
there or say well something happened but
we're not going to talk about it or
well these these uh crazy conservatives
they're making some claims but they're
all wrong so don't pay attention to them
but have you ever seen them just go dark
on the biggest story in the history of
the united states
just not covering it what's that tell
you
it tells you they're complicit what else
would it mean why else would they not
cover
the biggest story in again the history
of the united states there's no bigger
story than this
you know wars may be your bigger stories
but
this is pretty big and
if you wondered hey is cnn and the
mainstream media are they
are they sort of complicit with whatever
this coup
thing was and i would say at this point
it's obvious
you know there are some claims that
you know you have to be careful about
making because you you get into
uh you know legal problems if you make a
claim that can't be backed up
so i'll just put it in the form of an
opinion
based on what i've seen a reasonable
person would conclude
there was an actual coup attempt brennan
was probably
the leader if not one of them one of
them or the leader
and that cnn at least
probably other media were a hundred
percent complicit
what else could you interpret this as
now um i don't know what other entities
are
covering or not covering it but keep an
eye on that
um so here are some of the things that
are coming out
in these this new drops and if i
understand this right
this stuff's all too complicated for me
so i
yeah i may be missing some details but i
believe it's true
i believe it's true that
the only reason we're learning about
these new things
is because the flynn case wasn't
dismissed
is that true that we wouldn't have known
this stuff
except that they made the mistake of
keeping the flynn thing alive
even after the prosecutor wanted to drop
it i mean what they're doing to flint is
just should just be another crime
i mean it's just a crime the way they're
treating that guy
and i don't know
so it uh it looks to me like that's the
only reason we would know this stuff
which is shocking
in itself so here are some of the things
we found out
that one of the primary sources for the
steele dossier
was uh suspected to be a russian agent
at the time at the time they put the
dossier together and they were deciding
what to do with it
even then they knew they knew
that the person who was a source was a
suspected
russian spy now you'd think that they
would mention that
to let's say the the courts or to
anybody who needed to know
hey just a heads up we've got this
information
but an important part of it comes from
somebody we suspect
is a russian spy you leave that out
and you're not playing on the on team
america
wouldn't you agree if you intentionally
leave out that little fact
you're not really on team america i
don't know what team you're on
but it's not this country um
apparently there's an agent who worked
on the case william barnett
who believed at the time and i guess
presumably still does
that the whole thing was driven by a get
to trump attitude
which he actually said at the time he
didn't see the
he didn't see the basis for the case it
just looked like it was political to him
now don't make too much out of that
because unfortunately any work group if
you could actually talk to them you know
privately and individually any work
group for any company
any organization anywhere you're going
to find
some people in the group who say i don't
know why we're even doing this it's all
a big mistake are we doing this for all
the wrong reasons
so there's always that guy so if you're
if you're ranking what
importance to put on these revelations
the fact that there was somebody on the
team
who thinks the whole thing was bs and
shouldn't have been done
you want to believe that that's really
meaningful and
maybe it is you know i'm not ruling it
out
i'm just saying that's one you got to
watch because you'll always get that guy
there's always a disgruntled employee
look at
look at all the whistleblowers who have
stories about trump
you always have that guy so just keep in
mind that
that's on the lower end of credibility
but might be true
if it's at least it fits all the rest of
the story
all right what else did we learn there
um we learned that brennan
falsified the intelligence about russia
what now
if if brennan had he was out of cia at
that time right
so he put together this small team of
five people
and the head of the team was somebody
who was his personal friend
somebody had control over they come up
with
a you know a set of
conclusions about russia and then
brennan tried to sell it to the country
as 17 intel agencies agreed
when in fact it was a group of five just
five people
all in the cia and really one of them
wrote it
so really one person and that one person
was hand picked by brennan
so really just brennan so brennan sold
that his own analysis which was not in
agreement with other people
in his own group people in his group
said hey
you should you should include this part
where we think
there's a good chance that putin
actually prefers
hillary clinton and the reason we think
he might
prefer hillary clinton is that she's
predictable
and she had already offered a reset so
he knows what he's getting
but he doesn't know what he's getting
with trump at the time
so brennan chose to leave out the part
where his own people said you know we
think putin might actually
prefer hillary clinton is that a big
deal
yeah yeah it's the biggest story in the
history of the united states
that's not a war um it's the biggest
story in the united states
in my opinion the head of the cia
literally falsifying russia and intel
according to what we've been told
for the purpose of overthrowing the
united states
government the illegally elected
government
now weirdly
there might be no penalty for this
because
how do you prosecute somebody for having
a different opinion
because that would that's just what he
could claim he could say yeah yeah
i saw the intel about putin preferring
hillary clinton
but in my opinion it was not worthy of
including
that's sort of the whole defense you
really don't need much of a defense
beyond
um yeah maybe i was wrong but that was
my opinion and it was my job to have an
opinion
i think i think it's not exactly illegal
to overthrow the the try to overthrow
the government and
fail so people operating at that level
know how to stay you know outside the
the bounds of
illegality while at the same time
overthrowing the government
or attempting to now since the penalty
for that is
probably zero because it you know
there'll always be
reasonable doubt what would you think
the penalty
should be if it were true and if it
could be proven
hypothetically what would be the
appropriate penalty
for a john brennan if hypothetically
it was found that he had actually tried
to overthrow the government
and he did it by falsifying intelligence
essentially leaving out intelligence
which falsified it
um i think the death penalty
right should you not be
subject to the death penalty for that
crime because i can't think of a bigger
crime
you know how could you do something
worse
seems like a death penalty crime to me
but i'll bet there will be no penalty
whatsoever
so here's i i guess i just don't know
what to do about the fact
that it looks like what's going to
happen
is that conservative media will make a
big deal about it
but have you noticed that if
conservative media is the only one that
talks about something
it never becomes real to the rest of the
world
right so i believe that our siloed news
has created this weird situation
where um you know somebody associated
with
the left could murder somebody on fifth
avenue
i'll just pick an example they could
murder somebody in fifth avenue
it could be recorded on ten thousand
cameras
confirmed in every possible way that
that's exactly what happened
this person murdered this person in
front of people
in front of a million cameras and if the
entire
left mainstream media decided just not
to cover it
it wouldn't exist even if the
conservative
media went crazy on it every day and it
was headlines and couldn't stop
talking about it as long as the other
side
simply treats it like it doesn't exist
it actually doesn't exist
we've reached the point where they can
disappear
reality not just make facts disappear
not just leave out a you know leave out
a detail
not guess something wrong not even fake
news
actually disappear an entire
chunk of reality while you're watching
them do it
that's where we're at now if you had
told me that that was even possible
i might have said well in some weird
theoretical way
but watching it happening is just
blowing my freaking mind
i mean my head is just coming right off
when i'm watching
cnn literally just ignore it no there
was no coup attempt i don't know what
you're talking about
what else could they ignore
what else could they ignore it's like
they could ignore anything
and just ignore it and that it doesn't
exist
here's a weird little story kim jong-un
has
issued an apology for killing
some south korean guy who tried to
defect to the north what
the first thing you have to ask yourself
is why did somebody in south korea
try to defect to north korea
what the hell is is there somebody in
south korea who hadn't done any reading
about north korea
what did he think was going to happen
when he went to north korea
well i'm going to have a good life up
there in north korea
so apparently he was he was just drilled
full of bullets and
and killed by the north koreans because
they didn't they didn't know what they
had there it was just somebody it looked
like
was breaching their territory so they
killed them
um kim jong-un and here's the weird part
issued an apology
he issued an apology that's a pretty big
deal
because you know you want north korea to
say
enter the let's say enter the the field
of adult
you know adult countries if you will to
just
act like more of a citizen of the world
and this is a small thing
because you know obviously the apology
was warranted
but you still didn't expect it right you
you would have more expected
yeah it was an accident but don't send
your people across the border what did
it what the hell did you think was going
to happen
or just not mention it or something like
that
but apparently kim jong-un assuming he's
still alive if he's still alive
thought that uh playing it more
diplomatically was
was good so that's a good sign but i
have to ask you this question
when was the last time we'd know we saw
kim jong-un
when was the last time we saw him alive
now i realized that there was a video of
him
visiting someplace
after people had been rumoring that
maybe he had died
so you remember a few months back there
was a rumor he died but then there was a
video of him in public
he looked healthy so then the rumor just
went away
sort of not to me
not to me i'm not convinced
he's still alive and or functioning
you know he might be on machines or
something but i'm not
i'm not convinced he's alive because we
haven't seen
live video have we we've only seen
recorded video
and they probably have you know a vault
full of recorded video of
places he visited that they just didn't
publish the uh
the video so they probably just pulled
out something from the archive and said
here he is he's he's visiting this
factory over here so i'm totally alive
there is some evidence that his sister
is gaining
power which might be a tell
but this apology feels a little out of
character
but maybe not because he is you know
moving
toward you know friendlier relations i
would just keep an eye on it
and i'm going to put it out there again
that
well here here's your best clue do you
remember i forget when it was
maybe a month or two ago when president
trump tweeted
with no no prompting
there was nothing that triggered the
tweet he tweeted that kim jong-un is
alive and well
do you remember that tweet just came out
of nowhere
nobody was accusing kim jong-un of being
anything but alive
and the president just out of nowhere
tweets he's alive and well
that felt very much like a favor for
north korea
didn't it a favor that
would only have one purpose which is to
have friendly relationship with perhaps
kim jong-un if he were to survive
whatever
hypothetical problem he had or whoever
takes over
it may have been just a favor for the
current or maybe the incoming
administration because it looked like it
it was just a tweet out of nowhere
it looked like there was some kind of a
favor going on there
so just keep an eye on north korea all
right i
did a little twitter
twitter survey and i asked
people if their opinion of black lives
matter
was improved or
or lessened let's say their empathy
was there empathy for blm more or less
because of the events of 2020
92 people who answered my unscientific
poll
mostly conservatives because if you're
following me on twitter you probably are
92 percent said that they have less
empathy
for black lives matter
less empathy um
and here's my question what's the point
of black lives matter is the point of
black lives matter to
convince themselves that black lives
matter
i don't think so i don't think they're
talking to themselves
is the point of black lives matter to
convince progressives
to change their mind about something
well i don't think so
because the progressives are actually
marching with them they're they're on
the same side
so who are they trying to convince if
anybody
well i would think they would be trying
to convince conservatives
under the assumption that that's the
group who needs to be convinced
then everybody would be on the same side
that some changes need to be made
and then they would work toward those
changes but
if 92 of the mostly conservatives who
answered my unscientific poll
said that they feel worse you know they
have less empathy for black lives matter
isn't that exactly the opposite
direction that's not just
missing the target that's running as
hard as you can in the wrong direction
while knowing it so here's the key part
do you think black lives matter doesn't
know it
do you think that they are that they
would be surprised
to find out that rioting and looting
is making them less popular now for
for the anybody who's new here you know
make an assumption that i'm not a
freaking idiot okay
so when you hear me say something like
black lives matter
rioting and looting your brain should
translate that into
yes yes yes most people are just
protesting peacefully
i get it most people by the numbers in
terms of percentage of people
by far are protesting peacefully but
they also
are creating a container which they know
will
contain the bad people so if you're part
of an
intentional process to create a safety
container
for looters and rioters
i throw you in the same same you're in
the same bag
the first few times you do it maybe you
just need to get something out of your
system
but if you do it every day and the
rioters and the looters are in your
container every day
well it's a bad container and you're
part of it
so who is black lives matter
trying to persuade if it's so obvious
that they're doing the opposite of
persuading
well what if it's just the obvious
what what would be the most obvious
interpretation of what you see if you
saw black lives matter say
we need these following changes these
are the changes we need
and then we were talking about them and
we were meeting about them maybe there
was some legislation about them
then i would say okay this is a solution
oriented movement
this is a group of people who know what
the problem is
they they've got a pretty good idea
where the solutions lie
or where they could lie or at least
where it's worth trying
you know it's worth trying something and
and they're going to work on it they're
going to put up a trial they're going to
try to get some funding
try to get everybody on the same page
really make this world a better place
where is that is defund the police
anything like a plan
no it's not even that's not even really
trying to be a plan
because you would need you know way more
than that
so what would be the most reasonable
interpretation
of a group that it has apparently no
interest
in solutions they sometimes talk about
things got to be better but without some
detail
about a solution any kind of a leader
who's putting together a task force
any kind of a document that you know
everybody's rallying around
without any of that what is this
i only i can only give it one
interpretation
it's revenge it's just pure revenge
and when i see revenge i include
um envy you know i
i had been a skeptic of the idea that
the income inequality would
drive society apart because i would say
to myself
if everybody is doing better why would
they want to change that situation
by killing the people who are doing
extra good knowing that it would make
the whole system fall apart
and i think the the only conclusion that
i can come to from all of this
is that it's hard to have a difficult
life
while you're watching other people have
a good life and you kind of hate them
i you know i think back to my early days
when i grew up
and i i guess my family would have been
considered
maybe lower middle class something like
that i think we would have called
ourselves
lower middle class and every day i would
wake up
and there was a big window in the front
of the living room
and acro and looking out my window was a
ski slope
and the ski slope is where all the the
wealthy people came to ski
so every day i would look at that ski
slope and i would say
every one of those people coming down
there this is an exaggeration but
it felt like this those people skiing
over there they all have a better life
than i do
how did we talk about those rich people
did we talk about them in glowing terms
but because
you know man we sure we sure do
love those rich people who were over
there having a great time while we're
trying to get by no we did not
no we did not we spoke of them in
somewhat dismissive terms like there was
something a little bit wrong with them
for being rich and happy and successful
now it wasn't we weren't terrible about
it i mean we weren't you know
we didn't think they should be hung or
anything but we had a little bit of an
attitude
that just sort of comes with the fact
that somebody is doing much better than
you
to me it looks like black lives matter
the movement
including the the white folks who are
you know the allies if you will
the antifa it feels to me like these
people are people who are hating people
who are doing better
and that is not a movement of equality
per se
is far more a movement of revenge
against people who are living good lives
it looks revengey now i'm seeing in the
comments somebody saying that they're
bullies
well i'm not sure bullying is quite
exactly the right vibe
although that's the the the output of it
so they you know the result of it
certainly looks like bullying
but in terms of the internal intentions
which are always difficult to
you know discern because you can't read
minds
but without solutions
it is obvious that it's not a
solution-based
movement i think that part we can
conclude
and remember it was blowing my mind when
i was watching
van jones talking about the brianna
taylor
situation and when you watch somebody
who's
clearly smart you know he's got all the
knowledge in the world about the
situation
there's no no gaps in his understanding
whatsoever
and then i watch him realize that the
story wasn't what it had been reported
earlier
in other words it wasn't police killing
somebody because they were black
rather it was just an accident tragic
stupid terrible accident shouldn't have
happened
you know you can say lots of bad stuff
about it it's all true
but it was an accident now what should
have been
the reasonable response to someone who
had let's say
legitimate feelings about you know
police brutality
but they had been triggered by at least
lately triggered by this
event and then find out that event was
not what they thought it was
what what would they do if they were a
legitimate
movement who wanted solutions well i
think they would have
said okay we were wrong about that one
but there's still plenty to talk about
and sorry we missed that one
you know you could see why we missed it
it's
you know they made errors when when they
killed her
maybe we made some errors when we
interpreted it but let's not get hung up
on that we got lots of other stuff to
talk about that's bad
let's talk about that let's just let
that one go
but that didn't happen instead they
doubled down
they doubled down on the thing that we
can all see the same information
and it just wasn't relevant to the
complaint
the only thing that makes sense since
they don't care about the facts of the
case
and they don't care about solutions it
only makes sense
and even van jones sort of talked about
it as a
an emotional pain which seems to be
you know fairly a widespread feeling
that there's
actual pain that they're experiencing by
you know the i guess the fullness of the
entire situation
including their entire lives in fact van
jones was saying
that he was getting sick and tired if i
can paraphrase it right
that in his own own life experience and
you would expect
him to have more of a more of a favored
experience
because he's he's you know talented
smart good-looking successful
you'd expect that his life would look
pretty good compared to most people
but even he said that pretty much it's a
daily
weight you know racism is like a daily
pain that never goes away it's just
always there it's just following you all
day long
and while i wouldn't deny that that that
feeling is true
i have no reason to question that even a
little
what does that make you do have you ever
been anger
angry uh and lashed down as somebody
has anger ever caused you to be mean to
somebody
who just didn't deserve it yeah yeah
that's what it does
that's what anger does it causes you to
be angry
and it causes you to be mean to other
people
so i feel like we need to stop
pretending that this is about solutions
and we need to stop pretending it's
about making the world a better place
because it so clearly is not and
if any of these people ever wanted to do
any of those things
talk about solutions talk about how to
make it a better place
i feel like there would be plenty of
people to help them
remember when the george floyd thing
first happened
and i and lots of other people made this
observation
this was the one time when the whole
country was on the same side
what should have happened if people
wanted
solutions then the the black community
should have said
some version of this do you see what we
mean now
the white community having seen the
georgia floyd video would have said
as i did and many people said oh i get
it now
i wasn't quite seeing what you were
saying but now we've watched this video
and i totally get it now
now it turns out fentanyl was part of
the story so even that was fake news but
at the time
all white people were on their side all
white people
i mean it was just universal you saw
that video and you said oh whoa
whatever we thought before this is
different
like this this uh this just puts you on
the same page
like okay i get it now we gotta we gotta
figure out how to make this never happen
again
but that didn't happen instead of being
on the same side we were treated like
the enemy
when when white people were saying i
really want help
like this is real i seriously
legitimately
want to help no you're the enemy
how am i the enemy if i want to help
legitimately and seriously
so i'm going to completely disregard
disregard blm and antifa as any kind of
a positive movement
in society we have to treat them
like they're a revenge movement
and then what do you do what do you do
if you
if you finally correctly diagnose the
problem
and the and the problem is that revenge
is what they're trying to
accomplish well they're going to have to
get revenge
you know the the one way that this could
be
i won't say solved but you could take
the some of the energy out of it
black people are going to have to get
revenge
and if it's not presented
you know as some kind of a package hey
this will hurt us
so how about we do this because it'll
hurt us you know
we'll we'll take some pain if you'll
stop protesting
um i don't know how you could package
that up
i don't know any practical way to do
that so
my guess is that the way this goes is
that there will be
a bunch of white people probably police
who just get killed it just gets
slaughtered
and that the number of white people who
were killed
and you saw this happen in louisville
right the two police officers were shot
and what looked like just a targeted
sniper attack
i don't see any other way this goes i
think it goes to
some amount of slaughter of
police officers probably of you know
various colors
and white people i think death
is probably the only way to get to get
the emotion out of it
so that even you know even the black
public
who support blm uh by and large
you have to get to the point where even
they say whoa that's not
exactly what i signed up for i wanted
less
systemic racism i wanted less you know
danger from the police
i wasn't signing up for killing white
people that's
that's you know that's too far on out
probably has to get there
otherwise it can't ever be resolved but
if we think it has anything to do with
solutions or legislation
i think we can rule that out now it
feels like that could be completely
ruled out
all right i said in a tweet yesterday
that i'm no political campaign expert
but isn't it suspicious that
biden doesn't know his campaign schedule
a day in advance
because it seems to me that if you're
going to put a lid on your entire day
you would know that yesterday when you
are are they so unorganized they don't
know what biden would
should be doing today they have to wake
up and it's like nine in the morning and
they're like
all right well i guess there wasn't
anything public on the schedule so we'll
put a lid on it
it feels way more like they have to see
how he's doing
doesn't it it feels more like they wake
up in the morning and they say all right
is anybody
has anybody checked on joe yet and they
and they talked to
you know here you're just imagining this
but they talk to jill and they say
how's he doing is he okay this morning
and then jill says one of two things i
think he's doing okay
let's let's go ahead with the schedule
or she says
i don't know he's a little slow this
morning we better put a lid on it
i feel like that's what's happening if
there's another explanation for why the
lid would be put on
at the last minute instead of knowingly
in advance
i'd like to hear it um
are you also wondering why there are no
insider leaks
in the biden campaign isn't that a
little suspicious
don't you think that there are
conversations in
the biden campaign about things that
would be embarrassing
if they came out they're probably
conversations about how they deal with
the progressive wing
that if anybody heard those about those
conversations that would be news
there certainly are conversations about
biden's
um let's say his uh
mental acuity and even his his general
health
you know those conversations are
happening because you can see with your
own eyes that he has days that he's
better than other days so obviously
they're talking about it behind
the closed doors but
nobody except for this one
except for 4chan so acknowledging that
there are
insider leaks allegedly on 4chan
what i'm talking about is why they're
completely missing in
the new york times where is the
washington post
story about the insider and the biden
campaign
who says you know this is what they're
talking about in the campaign
it's kind of missing right
am i being crazy here or is it obviously
missing
because there are tons of insiders who
are willing to you know knock on
trump for any any number of real or
imagined
things but there's nobody nobody on the
biden campaigns willing to do a little
whisper whisper
to a to a journalist i'm not buying it
what i believe is that insiders probably
have talked to
the press and i believe that the press
is just not running the stories
that's my belief i don't know if it's
true
but i don't know why else there would be
no insider stories
on in the in the major press that is
um what would happen
under the condition that the election is
not deemed
credible now i know that there's a a
constitutional series of steps
um let's let's say it goes to the
supreme court but they're
you know the country is still not happy
with whatever they come up with
um i know there's the part where nancy
pelosi could become
president if things aren't sorted down
by certain dates so i know the
constitution has some steps
but suppose because it's 2020.
you know in 2020 nothing's clean but
suppose
that despite all the well-described
steps for solving the stuff
the country is just not convinced we had
a real
election what if forty percent of the
country
thirty percent pick a number uh at the
end of it say you know i don't trust the
result
i just don't trust the results what
would happen
well let me put this thought into the
public mind
if it's a tie the tie goes to the
incumbent
because it has to now not if it's a
second
term you know not if it's the end of a
second term
right if you know if if a president
served two terms
that's a different situation but in this
situation where you've got a president
who has served one term
is running for re-election if we don't
have a clean result
you have to default to the incumbent now
yes i would say the same thing if the
incumbent
were a democrat all right same situation
just reverse the party and i will still
be consistent
you have to go with the incumbent if you
don't get a clean result
now if at the end of the eight years
then
you you're gonna have to bring in
somebody new one way or the other
but you just got to go ty has to go to
the runner
because that would be the most stable
situation and anything
less than that would be so just
destabilizing i don't think it would be
worth it
and that's and and i say that again
regardless of which party
is involved you just can't inject that
much uncertainty into the
system and hope that it is free
pbs did a fascinating experiment
that should scare the hell out of you
and it showed how easily brains can be
hacked
and i think it was hacking your mind was
the name of the
the special and so what pbs did was they
primed people before asking them for
their voting preferences
and the way they primed them was a
half of the people got just generic
information they had no
no emotional content and then they said
all right
uh who do you vote for then they give
them some you know dry
unemotional information and then they
check later and they say okay now who do
you vote for and what
what topics do you favor now the people
who just got dry boring information
had the same opinion afterwards as they
had before
so you might ask yourself what kind of
information could you give somebody
that would fairly instantly change their
voting preferences
is that such a thing and if there was
such a thing would it be true
in other words could you give somebody
information that's unambiguously just
true
and it instantly changes their voting
preferences
yup because they did it
they did it they instantly
changed people's voting preferences
instantly meaning you know in a few
hours
they changed people's voting preferences
here's the information they gave them
they had only white voters so they
started with just a white
group of voters and they gave them the
information that
white people were becoming a minority in
the united states
which is you know factually true
in the sense that the population of
white people
is dipping below 50 percent of the total
population
having primed a bunch of people who were
voting sort of
left-leaning ways people who were let's
say
against the wall once they were told
that their group was the implication is
threatened
because well your power is going to be
decreased because now you're you're
going to be under 50
and shrinking as soon as white people
were told
that their power was decreasing their
numbers were no longer a majority
they voted conservative suddenly they
wanted a wall
suddenly they voted for a whole range of
conservative things
that two hours earlier they wouldn't
have voted for
instant change now remember i've told
you that persuasion
you know is not all equal there are some
things far more persuasive than other
things
facts are usually not persuasive but
fear is
fear is persuasive in fact nothing is
more persuasive
than fear so the way the information was
presented to this
these groups of white people in the
experiment
was that they were there there was some
kind
something to be afraid of and i believe
they tried to see if they could soften
it
by just changing the way they described
the same set of facts
so if they describe the set of facts of
hey you know white people are becoming a
minority
what if they softened it and said but it
won't make any difference to your life
because what matters is education level
and the
the non-white population is you know
far more educated than it's ever been
before and improving every day
they've got good jobs everything's going
to be great
melting pot we're good
so they can actually keep the votes the
way they were originally
left leaning simply by the way they
described
a fact if they described it just
objectively
people were scared to death and they
voted accordingly and if they
fixed the data by couching it and ah
don't worry about this
you know there's nothing to worry about
their votes didn't change
somebody says as a master persuader you
are not surprised
no i was not surprised that a fear
that is this direct would have an impact
i
i was a little surprised although i
shouldn't have been because the book
pre-suasion um says this pretty much
exactly that that the entire range of
conservative opinions changed
things that had nothing to do with being
you know white or not white
even those things ended up being
influenced so that was a even more
dramatic than i would have expected i
think
even though the science suggests that
that would be the case
somebody says the left doesn't want a
melting pot in unity they want
destruction and division
well i would not align with that
i don't i don't think that anybody wants
destruction what they want is what comes
after the
you know the rebuilding um or
they're just angry and they're just
jealous
they're just they just are full of hate
and i think that explains it better
there's videos of black antifa beating
up white antifa members
all right well i'm sure there will be
more
infighting among the protesters
yes did you all see the the crenshaw ad
so representative uh crenshaw of texas
um did uh did a campaign ad
that is such high production values it
looks like a
a trailer for a bad action movie now
they did it kind of campy so they
weren't trying to make it look too
serious
it was all tongue-in-cheek but man was a
high production value
it's probably one of the best campaign
ads you'll ever see
just in terms of quality of production
and stuff
and it did make you feel good you
actually felt something when you watched
it
and you liked all the people in it it
made you like them
and it was good it was a little
awkward uh with the male female part of
how they handled it
the the problem that they had when they
made the video
apparently is that it started out with
several ex-military people who were
running as
republicans and and they were men
so the men who were first introduced
were ex-military
and so you know they were they were
presented as awesome
fighters and stuff but there were two
women that they wanted to include
part of the republican family of
candidates
who did not have military experience so
they
they tried to make them seem awesome too
it was a little cringe-worthy but they
did the best they could
still i would say that uh
i i would say that they did a great job
on it it was very fun
and it was very viral so they i think
they had all the right
he had all the right notes um
yes my i'm hearing from a number of
people who really liked my
uh hold my beer video that
jack murphy was tweeting the other day
i'm surprised that that didn't get wider
play because the people who saw it
seem to like a lot by the way i'm
getting lots of ideas from people who
are suggesting things about my
idea for a small but awesome house i
will remind you that my idea for
building a small
cheap inexpensive dwelling for people
is only i'm only interested
if it's cheaper and better than regular
houses if it's just cheaper
but way worse i have no interest in it
so
don't send me anything like that i don't
care about these little small homes i
don't care about factory-built homes
none of that is interesting to me
because they're not better they're just
cheaper
it's got to be cheaper and better i
think we can get there
all right um how to break the news
silo somebody says
pop music says
well i don't know that you can if i
could come up with a way i would
i would certainly do it i've been asked
often as you might imagine
how can you how can you beat
um trump derangement syndrome you know
how how do you unprogram somebody
and i think the answer is you really
can't do it unless you're one on one
if you give me somebody one-on-one i i
could work on them
and maybe i could convert one person if
i spend all afternoon
but i don't know if there's a mass way
to do it
except that that pbs experiment i told
you
the pbs experiment would change your
vote
well i don't know if it would cure your
tds
somebody says dwell magazine has some
great designs
for small structures no they don't
so that's what i was warning you about
if you look in dwell magazine
or pretty much any place that talks
about
smaller structures they're just worse
they're just worse it's got to be better
than a regular house
it's got to be better that's the only
thing i'm interested in and there's no
reason it can't be
all right uh yes the amy comey barrett
announcement if she's the one
starting to sound like she will be one
oh somebody says that the tiny home
pickup truck idea
rests on sips sips that are structurally
integrated panels
so they're like big chunks of things
that you can easily build things with
i just saw an australian company
somebody sent me on linkedin
a link to a company that builds walls
and solar panels
so they frame it with a metal structure
and i guess
the metal structure parts two people can
assemble themselves
but the outside of the home is mostly
solar panels
and they actually figured out how to
make solar panels wait for this this is
cool
plywood now costs more than a solar
panel
so if you had a choice of making making
your home
with a wall of plywood or just using a
solar panel that wasn't even hooked up
to the grid
the solar panel would be cheaper the for
the same physical square footage
a solar panel is cheaper than plywood
now that was the claim i just read
from a company that's making these
things and they figured out how to get
the solar panels uh structurally hard
enough
using the metal backing the metal frame
that they just build the outside of the
wall with
with the solar panels so
i'm not sure if that idea is less
expensive but it's interesting
all right that's all i got for now i'll
talk to you tomorrow
