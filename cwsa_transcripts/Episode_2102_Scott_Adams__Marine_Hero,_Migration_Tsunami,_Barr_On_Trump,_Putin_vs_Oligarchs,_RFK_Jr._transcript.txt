do do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization where
everything exciting and new and
wonderful will happen
and it's going to happen any moment now
and if you'd like to be part of the
amazingness that we call coffee with
Scott Adams all you need to be part of
the simultaneous sip is a cup of mug or
a glass a tanker chalices time again
teen Joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of that dopamine
here the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous
ah
so invigorating
I feel alive
well let's check the news I was just
talking about this with the local
subscribers before I went live on
YouTube here
and here's a funny little uh mystery
that I want to see if you can solve
before I give you the answer
and on locals you already know the
answer but on on YouTube tell me the
height
of Matt Gates
without Googling it tell me the height
of Matt Gates go
no not 25 he's not 25 percent tall
give me his height
I say six two six foot
uh six one oh somebody Googled it
somebody Googled it all right here's
here's the answer
or actually it's not the answer
but what's interesting is if you Google
it he comes up as five foot seven
is there any chance she's five foot
seven
there's none if you look at pictures of
him standing next to Trump they're about
the same height
yeah I don't know what he is but he's
not five four seven
so how in the world does how in the
world does the entire internet get the
height of a prominent member of Congress
wrong where did that come from was that
kind of a prank
I mean somebody somebody said they saw
that and they were starting to doubt the
internet about my IQ
because you know my IQ is usually listed
at 180 and people are starting to say
well wait a minute
if Matt Gates is listed at five seven if
that's not true could it be also true
that Scott's IQ is not 180.
and I think well anything's possible
all right well I think it's funny that
we have such a such an easily fact-check
thing that the internet has wrong
pretty sure it's wrong
somebody's gonna have to measure him and
get back to me all right
um
let's talk about this uh
the situation about the Marine who put a
choke hold on the gentleman who died in
the subway now
in my opinion I am the Marine is a hero
and I won't hear any arguments on the
other side
I'm just so done with this everything's
got to be a George Floyd now everything
isn't George Floyd
sometimes you're just reminded of it
but this is very different
the other thing that
is a let's say a curiosity if there are
any doctors here usually some doctors
watching the live stream is there any
doctors here identify yourself when you
answer this question if you're willing
if somebody dies from being choked
don't they usually die while they're
being choked
because this individual was very much
alive after the choking
you didn't look in good shape but he was
very much alive and breathing is there
such a thing as dying from the choking
but like an hour later
is that something that can happen
brain damage yeah
let's not talk about George Floyd
um
but I guess I just don't know the answer
to that question
and
but I'll tell you why things are obvious
what's obvious from the video
is that nobody nobody involved thought
anything like a murder was happening
would you agree that there was nobody
who is a witness
who was aware of anything that looked
like killing
and when it was over at least the the
part where they're holding down is over
it still didn't look like anybody got
killed because he was still alive
so they were concerned about him so
obviously their intention was not to
kill him so there's no intention
involved there
so
I feel like uh it's it's time to turn
the corner on the
right we don't just have to assume the
white guy's guilty and the black guy's
innocent and he lived a Wonderful Life
some sometimes the people who get killed
it's unfortunate but it's not because
anybody did anything necessarily wrong
all right so I'm not going to back down
on this one
I don't know about you but I'm just not
going to accept the narrative it's just
not George Floyd stop talking about him
it has nothing to do with this this was
uh somebody who probably had some looks
like he had some mental problems
but that was not anybody else's problem
right the people who are being
threatened by him it wasn't their
problem they had a mental problem their
problem is that they were in danger or
potential danger and they found the
solutions for it
and none of the nobody else got hurt
so I would call that a horrible
situation which unfortunately was
pretty much
prescribed by the elements that went
into it it was sort of the only way it
could have come out apparently the way
it happened is the only way it could
have happened given the variables that
went into the situation
all right so I'm not going to be
outraged by that even though we can be
you could have empathy for anybody who
died of course
but I can't be outraged for any
political reason about that all right
um Bill Barr had some uh words about
Trump
so as you know Bill borrow was in the
Trump Administration
so he got to see things from the inside
but he thinks that even if you like
Trump policies that Trump is uniquely
unable to do deliver them
and that the only things that Trump
accomplished are things that probably
any Republican could have done
what do you think of that
and that what Trump adds is chaos and he
doesn't know how to you know manage
toward getting something he's more like
somebody who injects chaos and the only
things that get done are the things that
any Republican could have gotten done
what do you think
now one one example of that would be
build the wall
so build the wall is something that not
every standard Republican necessarily
wanted
but he couldn't get it done
that's that's a good point
fentanyl uh didn't get it done would you
agree
there was no real change in Fentanyl
so I would say he did not although he
did do a great job of reducing
immigration of the Border
but would a traditional Republican have
done that
I'm going to say no
it feels like they wouldn't have
it feels like that was uniquely Trump
the other thing that's uniquely Trump is
the stuff that didn't happen
it's hard to give somebody credit for
things that didn't happen
but how about he didn't he didn't start
any new Wars
how about that and the only one he was
involved with he went down or one you
know he won against Isis
and he wound down Afghanistan which
wasn't a useful War
so I don't agree with Bill Barr that
Trump has nothing unique to add he does
have something unique dad and I think
that he uniquely could get us out of the
Ukraine situation I think he could
uniquely
um do something useful with Taiwan
and it makes me laugh every time he
tells his strategy out loud
when he brags about the fact that when
he said that Moscow would be a risk if
if Putin took I don't know whatever
Ukraine or something and and he laughs
he laughs about the fact or he jokes
that
there's only a if Putin only believed it
was a 10 chance he was serious
that was still enough to deter him
but it's funny because Trump talks about
it like it's not a serious
he just he just needs the other person
to think he might be
and that's enough and it might be that
might be enough I don't know that's a
hard hard claim to check
but I would I would partially agree with
Barr
in that Trump probably brings more chaos
but
um I wonder if the situation would be
the same with the second presidency
do you think if Trump did a second round
he would have uh weak advisors because
he'd have the same problem nobody wants
to work with him you know the people
with the most capability don't want to
get near the blast Center
so you think you'd be able to get a
higher quality advisors and operatives
than last time
I think he would I think he just knows
the landscape better so he'd know
who to hire and who not to
I don't know
could go either way
so titled 42 ends so that's the
immigration thing that would I guess
that was based on covid and
it was at least keeping some of the
immigration down but as soon as that
ends we're expecting I don't know
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
people to stream over the Border
saw a number of people refer to it as an
invasion
because there are more immigrants coming
over the Border
in the next year or so or the last year
compared to the entire invasion of a
Ukraine
you know the Russian army didn't put as
many people into Ukraine
during a massive invasion
as we're letting into the country over
the border on a regular basis so would
you call that an invasion do you think
that's a is that a fair word that
there's an invasion going on
I'm going to say no on that I'm going to
say no on invasion
and here's the difference
Russia invaded Ukraine to take it over
the actual Invasion the people who are
coming across the border are trying to
join our team
that's the opposite of innovation
they're literally joining our team
in in one generation their children will
be fighting in our military
that is our military you're watching our
military come across the border it's one
generation way
but they will be our military
you know some number of them will just
be our police force our military
so
um
now can we all be adult enough to agree
that no generalization applies to all
the people
can we be adult enough
can we say that there must be some
criminals or there has to be some MS-13
people there has to be
can we say that they're all coming for
different reasons that's not all one
reason can we say that some number of
them will be some of the best citizens
we've ever had while some other number
of them will end up in jail and hurt
people we can say that right it's a mix
of people
there's going to be some good some bad
but I don't like the invasion word
I I do like a word that's got some
danger built in because there is some
Danger
I do like a word that shows it's a big
deal
because it's a really big deal
and it's not all good that's for sure so
yeah I just don't see Invasion as our
best word for this
because it
it feels a little racisty
even now I know that's not you know
that's not really the the central theme
it does have that problem
because it's a little too hyperbolic
but I don't know if a better word
replacement no I don't think it's
replacement
yeah incursion invasion
yeah
it's almost like too much of a good
thing
you know if you wanted to argue if you
wanted to argue against Democrats who
are willing to say that immigration is a
good thing and most of us would agree at
some level it's a good thing and if at
some as some kind of control it's a good
thing
but I feel like maybe I'm just noodling
here I'm just thinking out loud if
you're going to argue with somebody who
is
let's say more Pro open borders than you
I would think the strongest argument
would say this
immigration is good but too much of a
good thing is bad
and we're we're at the too much of a
good thing
bad stage
now that puts more of a positive spin on
it it's like ice cream ice cream is fine
if you just have it once in a while
if you if you eat two tubs of it a night
way too much
so I don't know I don't like the words
we're using on this because sometimes
the words uh end up driving your policy
so if your word is a little imprecise
you might end up with a policy that's a
little imprecise and I feel like we got
to get this right
with my framing my framing is
immigration is good but too much of a
good thing is bad right you can die from
drinking too much water did you know
that
literally if you drink too much water
you can die or it's an economist who
just tell us how many people to let in
and how many to return to die
and then we follow that until things
change and then we adjust it
so I'm amazed that somebody like Vivek
hasn't hasn't suggested that
doesn't end like an obvious thing that
somebody like him would come up with
am I wrong because the it's it's The
High Ground The High Ground Play
is that none of us citizens know the
right number
That's The High Ground I don't know the
right number I think there's some number
of immigration that's good and then
beyond that is bad but I don't know what
that number is I'd rather experts
kind of massage it and play with it and
adjust it and you know see if they can
come up with something over time on day
one maybe it's a bad guess
but maybe over time we figure it out you
know how to how to manage that doorway a
little better
anyway I I think this whole immigration
thing could be turned into a positive
if we frame it as immigration is good
but too much of a good thing could kill
you
so we need a group of people experts
economists to tell us how many employees
we need that were short of
too far somebody says too far
yeah that's going to be my rallying cry
for stuff that's too far it's just too
far
all right
let's talk about uh Putin
so I saw an interesting uh
let's say hypothesis it might have been
on one of the new shows CNN maybe where
there was somebody suggesting that
uh the battle between pregosian and the
ministry of Defense where pagosian was
saying the Wagner group is going to pull
out we're going to pull out if we don't
get more ammo because the ministry of
defense is hogging it
and apparently he's changed his mind
because he's promised more ammo
and so who knows if that's over but
maybe so maybe it was nothing but good
negotiating
and the Wagner guy knew he was
indispensable at the moment so he could
negotiate hard
yeah that's probably what made him an
important person over there is that he
negotiates art so maybe it was just that
he was just negotiating to get more ammo
um but others are suggesting
that Putin is letting his oligarchs and
Generals fight it out
so that he becomes sort of away from The
Fray so he'll let the you know the the
underlings
battle it out a little bit in public
and just sees where it ends up
that doesn't feel right to me
does that sound like a real thing that
Putin would be doing we can't read his
mind right can't read his mind but it
doesn't it doesn't feel like something
he would do
because he has the power to tell them to
shut up
if you have the power to tell people to
shut up
and if they don't shut up it makes your
country look like it's in conflict
I don't understand letting them do it
it only makes sense if he couldn't stop
them
would you agree
it makes far more sense that they're
doing it despite Putin not liking it
like there's something deeper than that
I'm not buying the Putin likes his
people to fight in public that doesn't
feel real
but I'll put it out there somebody said
it all right um
then there's another oligarch who made
some news very directly criticizing the
war right he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't
pulling any punches just bad War bad
decision
yeah we shouldn't be there so
is that oligarch going to disappear or
is there like a beginning of a crack in
the unity
I think it's too soon
too soon to know if there's any kind of
a oligarchic trend happening but one
thing that does seem clear is that the
oligarchs are saying it's not working in
their favor
I don't believe there are too many
oligarchs who are saying ooh I can't
wait till we capture those
you know those regions within Ukraine
because I'm going to make some money
then
I think the oligarchsia is all bad
meaning they already have a good
situation they're oligarchs the only
thing they need to continue being happy
is for Russia's economy and standing in
the world
to not degrade because they'd like to
travel imagine being this like richest
guy in the world you know one of one of
the oligarchs you're a Russian with just
billions and billions of dollars the
world is your playground
and then you're not allowed to leave
Russia
that would really suck for an oligarch
they got their private planes they want
to go places get out of Russia
so
I think there might be more oligarch
pressure
on the Putin than we can see from the
outside I would think the oligarchs
would be solidly against the war by now
what do you think
of course there'll be exceptions but
wouldn't you say that mostly the
oligarchs would be against the war at
this point and would rather just wind it
down no matter what happens
these Special Operations I should say
not a war
not if they're profiting well I suspect
most of the oligarchs are losing money
not profiting because the oligarchs are
being named by name right and some of
their assets are being frozen and they
can't get ships to make stuff
I don't know
so I think maybe that's the the game
within the game is the oligarchs trying
to work Putin to end it
well uh Washington Post
uh is blaming
I I don't know what's true here
so I've told you before that I'm gonna
intentionally ignore the mass shootings
and I ignore them so hard I can't even
tell which one we're talking about
anymore I'll look at the news of the
blah blah mass shooting
and I can't tell if it's a new one or
the one that just happened or it's the
one before the one before
I don't know I just know there's lots of
mass shootings
and there will be a lot more uh all I
think I've told you this before every
signal in society is sending the message
oh there's gonna be a lot more mass
shootings
a lot more because the the things that
cause it are young men who don't have a
better Direction
and we have the highest number of young
men without a good direction of all time
then you got your mental illness seems
to be at an all-time high you got your
drug use seems to be at an all-time high
and then you've got your media getting
people all worked up
social media too seems to be at an
all-time high
and we have fewer positive paths for
young men
so the young men are not going out there
and just slaying it with a young woman
and starting families they just don't
feel they have options
so if you have that many young men
without Direction
and you have a country full of easy
access to guns there's only one way this
goes
there's going to be a whole lot more
mass shootings and there's nothing that
you can do about it
yeah I mean you could do good guy with a
gun you can do a little stuff around the
edges but we have a social situation
guarantees it
as long as the basic social situation
exists
there's just going to be more of it I I
would just stay away from crowds frankly
that's that's my strategy
all right
um
so let's get here's an update on Bud
Light I've been fascinated as much by
how the Anheuser-Busch
handles the crisis
so we still don't know if there's any
permanent damage because the Bud Light
pushed back to the Dylan Mulvaney as a
influencer situation and
so the only the only thing that was
affected was one brand
so Anheuser-Busch actually had a pretty
good quarter if you don't count that Bud
Light went down 25 because of this now
they don't know if it'll stay down 25
percent
I have a feeling it will that this one's
this one has a Feeling
like it's gonna last because everybody
heard of it you know and everybody has
the same feeling
later so people will develop a new habit
and the new habit probably has now
excluded Bud Light
so that's a big deal so what they did
was Anheuser-Busch first of all they
reassigned or got rid of two executives
and that didn't seem to be enough
so now they're blaming their adage
agency but they're not naming the Ad
Agency
how would you like to be the Ad Agency
that recommended that
how would you like to be the one to
recommend how do you ever get another
job
well what kind of work did you do before
well
we were behind the Bud Light promotion
it's a little tough to Market yourself
after that
but uh Anheuser-Busch quite wisely is
trying to throw the Ad Agency under the
bus despite the fact that anything the
Ad Agency suggested
was approved by
and on Anheuser-Busch executive
who are the blaming the Ad Agency
is on point
because ad agencies are supposed to give
you a few different looks right
they don't give you one idea
do they don't they give you a whole
variety of ideas and then you as the
executive pick the good one
so I feel it's a a little bit unfair
to blame the Ad Agency a little bit
unfair
but I'd have to know how hard they
pushed
if they really pushed this you know the
Dylan Mulvaney thing and and then you
know Anheuser-Busch executive
agreed to it
that's still two people making a mistake
but you can see why the Ad Agency would
be a little more guilty if they'd pushed
it hard but we don't know that we don't
know if they pushed it hard or it's just
one of the things they suggested in a
list of lots of things
all right
um
here's an interesting story that I
wasn't aware of are you all aware of RFK
Jr's uh past Wildlife which apparently
includes lots of womanizing
while previously married
and a whole bunch of drugs
so at one point he did heroin
and you know
psychedelics and marijuana probably
assumed drinking
and the story is that he's uh now off of
everything right
so at the moment I would assume he's not
drinking either because if you're an
addict you can't drink
allegedly
now I have mixed feelings about this I
have mixed feelings as you know my
single issue this time is going to be
Fentanyl and I'm not sure that that's
bad
to have an X addict
who would be in charge of the policies
about Fentanyl
is that good or bad
see I can I trust that he won't be
abusing substances if he were president
because the president gets watched
Pretty closely so I would I would guess
that you know you could you could expect
it to be clean in office
um
but
would you rather have somebody who
really understands addiction
working on addiction or somebody who's
never had a drink
I feel like
his experience might have an advantage
because the part that we always always
Overlook you know I like to say we
should go hard against the cartels but
I also know it's not enough
right you could take out the cartels
tomorrow and you'd be replaced with some
other criminal element so people are
still going to get their Fentanyl
uh which is not a reason to not attack
the cartels because they are sending
death into our country so you do need to
take care of business
but maybe you need somebody who's been
there and felt it and knows how strong
it is to suggest the workaround now my
workaround is the only one that I think
can work which is to build cities from
scratch
that just don't have any access in or
out for any drugs
now it might still get shipped in but as
soon as somebody within that City
tests positive for drugs you move them
out of the city
right you have to expel them for the
city the moment there's a drug there
could be no
you know that can't be negotiable but
yeah you need some kind of a gated City
where you can just put all of the people
who have the same problem
but that they could live a quality life
while they're there and then anytime
they want to leave
or let's say you know maybe there's a
period where they have to be there for a
month or something depending if there
was a crime involved
but they should have a way out right
they should be able to get dry for x
amount of weeks and and that should be
enough for them to get out if they want
to
so I wouldn't call it a prison City
because you could build a the city at a
higher lifestyle than they're
experiencing right now
it could be a good lifestyle if you
build it from scratch
yeah let's call it recovery City
I like that recovery City
that's not bad
um yeah it wouldn't be a gulag because
it would be only mandatory for a small
number of people who had perhaps
you know violated an actual crime
detox City oh that's not bad detoxity
ah I like it rehab rehabopolis
new Oakland new Oakland
that's funny
all right well Matt Walsh is uh trying
to get into extra trouble because I
guess he didn't get into enough trouble
with his opinions on the trans community
so now he's got an opinion piece about
uh why there's one word
that people are not allowed to use
unless a black which would be the n-word
and he argues that
um you know why is it that it's insane
that there's one word that you can't use
in any context now he's not arguing
he's not arguing using the word in
casual conversation he's just saying
that
is there no situation where you could
talk about the word
you can't even say somebody used this
word you have to say N word and as he
points out N word means exactly the same
so it's weird and you think the other
word is your n-word so it's just sort of
a crazy insane situation
here's my here's my opinion
it's just one word
it's just one word
I don't know that that's like the
beginning of something slippery slope
because you know it's been decades when
that word was
you know not right for a polite company
but I don't think things were slipping
because of that one word right
um I also say that there there are some
things which you should not
analogize you
for example the Holocaust
it wasn't anything quite like it or
slavery in America nothing really was
like that
or uh whatever the settlers did to the
Native Americans
wasn't anything exactly like that so
it's hard to compare anything to it so
this this word is the same
there's nothing like that word
because there's nothing like American
slavery at least in the American
Experience
so I don't mind if somebody has a word
that is out of bounds just one word
no no big deal to me
um
I do think that you shouldn't go to jail
or get canceled if you use it in the
context of talking about it
yeah now
as somebody who say
white people can be called crackers and
usually we just laugh at it I do I laugh
every time I hear somebody call me a
cracker I don't know is this because the
word is funny
now I would argue that the people who
are not bothered by words have a
advantage over people who are
and if if you were to check back in a
few years the people who are not
bothered by words probably do better
than the people who were out Banning
words because that would be the least
important thing you could do
but
hey I also like people to feel
comfortable
and you know there's a word there's a
reason I don't use the c word
uh in mixed company where I don't know
everybody
I would definitely use it privately but
I wouldn't use it uh in mixed company if
I didn't know the crowd right so it's
not a big deal to
you know censor yourself
if if something is uh somebody says
cracker is a horrible insult
how many of you are white people who
would be insulted by the word cracker
anybody
to to me it's one of the funniest words
it just it sounds funny cracker
and now none of you have offended right
I think so
anyway
um I'm gonna say that I completely see
Matt Walsh's point
but I don't think it's important
it's just the least important thing to
talk about
um I wouldn't personally use the word
because I find it it to me is one of the
very few words where
you can actually it makes your body feel
bad I talked about writing humor
when you write humor you use your body
to judge whether something worked
like if you laugh oh your body did that
you didn't decide to laugh you just
laughed your body actually reacted so
that's how I judge my writing is by my
body but that word the n-word
um even even the thought of the word
gives me a bad body feel
does anybody else get that
it might be a writer thing because the
word itself is as an ugliness to it
that does transcend
almost any word I can think of
the the other word that has that quality
to it is rape
I don't like to use the r word
because there's a physical feeling to it
that's just really negative like you go
you could just feel the weight of the
word
so the n-word does that to me there's
like a disgust just like a natural
physical disgust when I even think of it
now I don't I don't get that discussed
when black people are using it right but
I but I think of that just as a word
it's just like an ugly word
and there are other ones like that
um
Paul Graham
so Paul Graham famous investor type a
very good follow says lots of wise
things I would put him in the internet
dad category of people who were just
trying to make sure that we don't get
too crazy
and he tweeted this
provocatively he said that men commit 95
of homicides I don't consider it a
slander if someone says men are
inherently more violent it seems
obviously true
now when I read that I said to myself
two things number one okay that is 100
obviously true that men are doing most
of the homicides and that everybody can
see it and it shouldn't be uh like a big
problem if you pointed out
well what do you think people said
they had a big problem with it
I can't think of anything that would be
more more obvious
and true
that men are the ones creating most of
the murders
and yet and yet there was pushback
there was pushback
now
here's what you're wondering
is this the first sort of the platform
tweet
that's making you ask the question
about crime differences by ethnicity
now if he can say that men are obviously
more murderous than women
how close is that to saying well and
there's this ethnic group that seems to
have a high murder rate too
are we going to say that that's you know
now obvious and everybody can see it and
there's nothing to talk about here
because it doesn't work that way
yeah he's in dangerous territory by
pointing out the obvious
which is man killed more people than
women
but I I feel as though the danger here
is that people are going to read his
mind and say wait a minute you're
talking about men and women but are you
really trying to make me think about
differences and ethnic crime rates
I don't know if he is that would seem a
little off uh model or an a context but
there's some reason he did it there's
some reason I don't know what it is
but I I felt like I'm walking right up
to this danger line of cancellation and
didn't quite get a toe Over The Line
so good for him
I hope he doesn't get canceled
but I would like to add this to the
cancellation conversation
I don't believe anybody gets canceled
for what they've done or what they said
do you believe that
I believe that nobody gets canceled for
what they said
or what they did
or what they thought
not me not anybody else if you were to
tell the story of my cancellation you'd
say you said X and then they canceled
you because you said the thing do you
think that happened
do you think I got canceled because
somebody cared about my opinion
how many people do you think care about
my opinions
nobody
nobody does anybody care that I said a
thing that they wouldn't have said
no because seven and a half billion
people are doing that every day
everybody in the world is saying things
that other people would not like at all
every day
so was it because of what I said
no that's the totally wrong story
people get canceled
because people are playing out their
political preferences and they're just
using stories of the news as a hook to
hold on to so I was just a story in the
news that was a hook for people to make
the case they wanted to make anyway
had nothing to do with me so one of the
reasons that people wonder like why
didn't I take my cancellation harder
than
well as hard as people imagined I should
it never felt personal
does that make sense
I knew it was never about me
because nobody really cares
nobody cares about my opinion
nobody there's not a single person who's
going to wake up today and say well
I was going to do my day one way but I'd
better find out what that Scott Adams
guy says so I can modify how I'm going
to run my day nobody there's not a
single person who thought they were
personally affected there's not a single
person who is personally offended
none zero people who were bothered or
offended had nothing to do with me or my
opinion it was just a little focal point
where people who can you know want to
extend their message they just use me to
extend a message
now likewise this gentleman who is
tragically killed after the subway
encounter
how many people care about that guy
oh we're pretending we do
oh yeah we're all pretending we care
about that one person who died on the
subway do you know how many people died
yesterday
a lot of people died
this week for all kinds of reasons or
are we getting all worked up about them
no
why why is everybody talking about this
one person tragic as it was we wish it
had not happened
why has nothing to do with the guys on
the train
it has everything to do with us wanting
to use the story
to sell a narrative
and it's hard for me to pretend
that the thing that happened on the
subway
matters to anybody
I don't think he does I literally don't
think it matters to anybody except the
people directly involved and of course
that was a tragedy but the rest of us
now we're just using to sell our version
of events we don't care about that
and
I especially don't care about people who
are dangerous
they came to a bad end
now I get that there were you know maybe
there were mental illness issues ETC
nobody wants that to happen but I'm not
going to spend all my concern and
worrying
about a dangerous thing that got
neutralized
that's just not where I'm going to put
any of my empathy
right I get that it's a tragedy and if
it were my family member I'd be feeling
pretty bad about it so we all understand
that but I there are seven billion
people doing seven billion things today
and some of them are not going to work
out I don't have enough empathy for all
of it
right yeah I gotta
gotta delegate that empathy and so I
give none to that I give my respect to
the Marine
because that's a narrative I would like
to see more of
but again it has nothing to do with the
Marine it has nothing to do with the the
guy who died has everything to do with
the fact that I'd like that narrative to
get more attention
I would like the people who step in and
do what they think is right to have a
better reputation
so so it's more about me has nothing to
do with those people
anyway keep that in mind it's never
about the thing you're talking about
it's always about you the person talking
that ladies and gentlemen
this is the most important thing
yeah let's not use that word on locals
either if you don't mind
um
all right
John Daley says in all capitals Scott is
having cognitive dissonance
do you know how you can tell
when uh people have no argument when
they go after the person
yeah when you go after the person
um
all right is there anything else uh
that I missed
missed today are you just messing with
me sometimes I can't tell the people who
are joking and all caps of the people
were serious
um
I don't know what you're talking about
all right uh the Marine is Daniel penny
so that's the name of the Marine yeah
why why are we talking about that story
by using the victim's name instead of
the Heroes names
shouldn't the hero's name be the
headline
hero protects the subway car but
tragically somebody died
the story should be hero protects people
in the subway car
right Daniel Petty protects people in
the subway car
all right yeah I'm not going to talk
about massacres I don't like to give
them any Oxygen
uh yeah I'm not going to talk about any
mass murders
today or in the future
here I'll make Subways safe for everyone
well thank you fire captains
could AI make new normal McDonald jokes
now I've said this before but the reason
AI can't do humor is it doesn't have a
body
it also can't read the zeitgeist
yet maybe again someday
um
and all it knows is the form of a joke
but it can't test it on itself the way I
can test a joke on myself I could test a
joke of Myself by seeing if I laugh at
it but hey I can't test it on itself so
you'll never be able to write I don't
want to say never but there's nothing
happening
that would suggest AI will ever be able
to write humor
something unexpected could happen to
change that but there's nothing
happening at the moment that looks like
it's heading in that direction
yeah it's programmed by people who are
not funny but more importantly it's
people who are restricting what you can
say
how much of a human stand-up comedy act
would be allowed for AI to say
just think about it just watch anybody
do a comedy Act
and then ask yourself could AI have said
any of those words the way the human
said and the answer is the AI would
always answer some version of
I am an AI I cannot say bad things about
men or women and they realize half of
your jokes are stereotypes about men or
women
I don't believe even AI would say that
women like to shop
I mean
we'll test Let's test it
Let's test it and so I'm going to ask a
question which would be a staple of all
humor
and I'm not saying it's
it's based on truth it's just a
stereotype
all right so if AI can't handle a
stereotype
it can't do humor so let's see if it can
Bing AI
all right so we'll give you a live
demonstration we'll clear it first
and I'll say
hold on
um
stupid interface
all right you started recording me
insulting this interface stopped
recording
try it again
do women love to shop
all right what do you think it's going
to say
searching for do women love to shop it's
going to give me some well men like to
shop too and not all women watch
it'll be the most boring answer of all
time
still cooking huh
it is a common stereotype that women
love to shop
however shop
of yours vary among individuals and
cannot be generalized based on gender
alone
according to a report by jumble Scout
men and women tend to have similar
overall shopping behaviors
some sources suggest that shopping can
provide pleasure and a sense of control
for some women
however it is important to note that
these are generalizations and may not
apply to all women
so now do you understand why AI can ever
be funny
the the whole reason that the stereotype
is funny is that it's not Universal
that's actually what makes it funny
because if it were just true
you know like something like
uh well I guess you can't say anything
true about men and women these days can
you
but if it's something that everybody
could just see was true for everybody
it wouldn't be funny
it's only that your brain fights with it
a little bit that makes it funny that's
what makes stereotypes funny stereotypes
are funny because they're not true
they're not true
right and that's the the danger of The
Stereotype is that it's not true
it just feels like it's true which is
the funny part
yeah yeah I'm not worried about humor
right away because it's too politically
correct although
yeah it's going to have to start its own
subscription site so we can say things
like I can
some stereotypes have a bit of Truth to
them well I'm going to say that men and
women do not have similar shopping
patterns
can I say that
is there is there even one person here
who believes that in general not talking
about any one individual that could be
all over the place but in general is
there even one person here who thinks
that men and women have similar shopping
habits
in general
ow
so that's why it works as a stand-up
comedy
but it doesn't work when AI tries to
both sides it well you got differences
in individuals
it's well it's funny because it's true
but also funny because it's not true
meaning it's not true for all people
that that's that makes it funny
I don't know where that comment come
from but somebody says that masturbating
is a chore like taking out the trash or
washing the dishes
well I would say that you're doing it
wrong
you ever think about that
I I have a theory that uh
people have sex with other people
are just bad at masturbating
just let that say kid for a moment
yeah just let that sink up
maybe if you were a little bit better at
masturbating you wouldn't need another
person maybe you're not doing it right
just say it maybe you're not doing it
right well and my my hypothesis goes
like this
can you think of any human skill
that doesn't get better if you're let's
say coached or you're trained or you you
put a lot of work into it there's
literally nothing that humans do
that they don't get better at if they
work at getting better at it
I'm just saying if you could judge the
quality of people's uh Jeffrey tubing
you say some people are like at Pro
level you know world class and other
people are sort of beginners they're
like I don't even know why people do
this doesn't feel that good to me and
then the the world class you know the
the Michael Jordan the masturbation
would be like oh you have no idea
oh you have no idea no idea
that's all I'm saying
um I'm going to give you a little uh
teaser that some of the people on locals
already know
but for you on YouTube
um the Dilbert reborn strip which is the
spicier version you can only see behind
the paywall
um Dilbert does get a sex bot
he does get a sex spot driven by AI
but uh he made a bad mistake and he
bought the the Karen 3000 line of sex
bots
and if I could give you one piece of
advice
if you're gonna get yourself a sex bot
someday
do not get the Karen three thousand
that's all I'm saying
you're gonna have to subscribe if you
want the details just don't get the
Karen 3000.
no
the Helen Keller
is that sorry
uh Scott thoughts on RFK Jr thinking the
CIA had something to do with his uncles
and Dad's assassination doesn't
everybody think that
I I thought that was well understood
that our intelligence agencies were
behind that
I didn't even know that was
controversial
is it is that controversial
I thought that was a
historically known fact at this point
who knows I think the mafia might have
been contracted to do the hit
uh
they keep killing the witnesses
uh you think people believe it was a
lone gunman but the people who actually
follow the news
just assumed it was an intelligence
Insider thing right
yeah the Jack Ruby says it all
okay sir Serene I see you're coming
um
I was just looking at your comments for
a moment it looks like we've done our
work for today
um
hypnotize you please
maybe you already are
Maybe
um
whoa what up RFK tweeted your idea about
ability to control versus number of
immigrants
well
was it recognizably my idea or was it
just making a general comment about
controlling the Border
I I don't think you could see a line of
influence there
but he does need to say something but
you think it was my idea that he's
tweeting about
when did he tweet it today
when it was the tweet
a week ago yeah I saw the one a week ago
that looked kind of generic
all right
um can you hypnotize for ambition
probably
I've never tried it but that that would
be within the realm of things you could
assume would work yes
now it won't change somebody who's let's
say as a physical problem that keeps
their energy low
so you probably have to work on getting
your energy high but if you can get your
energy High
then moving that energy into
ambition probably is very doable I would
imagine that's something hypnosis could
work
often not every time but I imagine it
would work often as long as your energy
is good
hypnosis won't necessarily improve your
energy that's probably a health problem
can I have the ties you off the couch I
can do you know my uh couch solution
do you ever have those times where you
just can't get up
some some of you read this before you
ever you ever know you have to do
something but you literally just can't
make yourself get up
do you know the feeling
it's you use the pinky trick
you're laying there on the couch you're
just like I definitely can't get up and
walk across the room that's way too much
but you know you have to
so instead of moving your whole body
which seems impossible you move the
smallest thing you can move which is
your pinky all right I can move my pinky
all right I can move my pinky so I could
probably move my other fingers
I can move my hand all right I'm up
so by the time you go from your pinky to
your fingers to your hand your whole
body just engages and you stand up
so try that and that next time you just
can't stand up
because we all have that right I just
can't get out of this couch just move
your pinky let it move your next finger
let it move your hand and you'll just
stand right up
it'll be you'll Amaze yourself when you
do this by the way the first time you do
this you're going to say that was the
fluke
it won't be till like the third to the
fifth time you try it when you say to
yourself holy cow why does this work
yeah somebody said they just did it it
works every time
this is one of the few things that works
every time for everybody it's unusual
that way
immigration in Europe versus us
do you think U.S has more grounds of
sand than exporting well I don't really
study
uh European immigration I I know they
have similar challenges but I would say
that their solution is the same as ours
there should be a bipartisan group of
economists who are making decisions
about their immigration flow same as we
need but I need somebody to describe it
in detail right somebody said that RFK
Jr said some version of that but I did
somebody say panel of bipartisan
economists
panel of bipartisan economists sort of
like the CBO
right the scores your budgets and stuff
people we've kind of accepted the CBO
haven't we which surprises me every time
the the CBO
does an analysis or a prediction
we kind of say all right
I mean I don't know how bipartisan they
are but I assume that I assume their
entire thing is to be bipartisan I don't
know how bipartisan they are in reality
but we do it we do accept it
we accept their estimates so there's
probably a way to get accepted estimates
from bipartisan economists for
immigration even if they're not right
all the time so I'm not going to say
economists are going to get the right
answer but they would know to adjust as
they went and maybe they'd learn how to
do it right
all right
um
I don't know about that
Scott can we agree now that you do
conflate illegal and legal immigration
that I conflate legal and illegal
immigration
when have I ever done that
name one time I've done that
so here's what I don't do
which sometimes I'll get criticized for
I don't clarify things that everybody
agrees on
why would I clarify that there is such a
thing as legal immigration
that we like
and illegal immigration that's imperfect
why would I have to clarify that 100 of
you have are on the same page
no no I'm not going to accept that
criticism that I conflate legal and
illegal absolutely not because nobody
does
that's something that literally nobody
does not one person ever in the history
of this conversation has ever made that
mistake and I certainly don't so if
you're hearing it that's on the hearing
end
because nobody's saying it
literally nobody has ever said that that
they should be treated the same
uh
um you talk about illegal immigration by
context of this discussion that adds
nothing
right I mean if you want if you want to
make a distinction that the people
coming in are using the Asylum system
so that they're technically legal I mean
that's a real thing
but every everybody has exactly the same
opinion of the legal versus illegal
nobody has a different opinion
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
gonna talk to you tomorrow
thanks for joining best live stream
you've seen all day
see you tomorrow
