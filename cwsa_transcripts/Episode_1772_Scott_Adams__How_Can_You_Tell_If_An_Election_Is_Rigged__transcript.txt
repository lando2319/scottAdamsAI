good morning everybody
and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
the thing that feels so good it makes
you
throb on the inside and if you want to
take it to a new level
and trust me today will be a new level
i'm going to take it right
to the icarus level if you know what i
mean
everybody get that reference
because you're so smart you probably did
and now if you'd like to icarus with me
all you need is a cupra mug or a glass a
tanker chelsea stein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of
any kind that is correct
philly with your favorite beverage
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the thing that'll snap you into a
good mood no matter where you started
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
joins you with people around the world
whether synchronously or asynchronously
magically it works just as well
go
oh yeah
oh yeah
well all you sipsters
are you ready to make some trouble
who wants to make trouble
well let me tell you
if there's one thing that a january 6
hearing
makes me want to do
is talk about the stuff that the january
6 hearing doesn't want me to talk about
so we'll be doing a lot of that but
first while people stream in here for
the greatest thing that's ever happened
some good news
there's a uk team got this from a jeff
pilkington
tweet
um a uk team this makes some kind of gel
that repairs heart attack damage
so they can inject some goop into your
heart
and it forms some kind of a structure or
lattice and repairs the physical
damage
and i'm thinking to myself
really
what
what if it works what if they could just
inject something into your heart and
make it healthy again
now it does seem like a stretch
but
today we're just thinking optimistic
things
so
until it's proven that it doesn't work
how about we think that it might
it'll give you a little burst of
optimism it feels good
just go with it
all right um
and i'm thinking
where else could you use that stuff
like is there other stuff that it would
repair how about if you had a hernia
just to pick a random example
suppose you had a hernia
which is where the muscle structure
weakens
but at the moment they have to do a
surgery and put this artificial
mesh thing in there to reinforce it
what if you could just shoot some goop
in there and and your original muscles
just grow back or whatever
i don't i feel like
i feel like we're on the
verge of like fixing hearts
curing a whole bunch of different cancer
types
a lot of good stuff happened
um
here's a a fascinating thing
in the the axios
news
uh what would you call them news
organization axios
and i would recommend putting axios on
your
daily rotation
because they do have some stuff that
is just you know good news
that you'd be interested to know about
and you know a little less political
ridiculousness
so
this is really interesting there's a
survey of uh how people think the
country is doing america
versus how they think they're doing
personally financially
do you think they would be the same
right
do you think that in general if you ask
people how are you doing
with your personal finances
whatever that trend line looked like
would probably be similar on average you
know people would be all over the place
but on average
be kind of a similar slope
to what they thought the country in
general was doing because they would
represent the country in general
turns out
nothing like that's happening
it turns out that people actually think
their personal finances are are better
than ever
would you have guessed
people believe their personal finances
are better than ever right now
when i say ever i mean for a long time
at the same time
they think the country is going into a
nosedive
financially
how do you explain that
do you explain that people think that
personally they're doing better
maybe better than in a long long time
there's an obvious reason
because people don't understand debt and
inflation
and there's a time lag
people at the moment are well employed
3.6
and they might even gotten a raise
recently
because of inflation
and maybe they said well
i don't have to drive as much so i can i
can at least
you know pull back on some of that stuff
a lot of people can't
and
so it makes sense to me that the people
the things that you understand
have a higher priority in your mind
right
if you simply see something and look at
it and touch it and understand it it'll
seem like that's the important variable
even if it isn't
so people do touch their own life
by definition
all day long
and so you're always touching your
personal finances so if those seem
pretty good
that variable is going to look pretty
important
here's what you don't see and touch or
even understand
national debt
and how that printing money fits with
inflation and all that
because if you did
you'd be in a full panic
now this will be
and
i've been challenged on this
you've heard me talk about the adam's
law of slow-moving disasters which means
that if we can see a problem coming
with enough time to adjust we always do
you know we the the world hasn't run out
of food
you know we you know there are all kinds
of things that we thought we were going
to run out of and then we just figured
out
how to make it work
you know the year 2000 bug
we had enough time we just fixed it
fixed the bug you know hole in the
ozone i guess we had enough time
we you know ban certain things and the
hole is closing
so lots of things that we can fix all
kinds of things that you wouldn't
imagine would be fixable and i think
climate change will be one of those one
of those things that you couldn't
imagine is even possible
until somebody figures out how to do it
so the thing that you can't foresee
and this will this will blow you away
but the thing you can never foresee
are the things you can't foresee
in other words you can't really predict
the future
nobody can because you have all these
surprises
so
um
is it possible
that this thing that looks impossible to
solve which is our continuous printing
of money
which will
you know if you just straight lined it
forward
the dollar
becomes less of a reserve currency and
inflation eats us all to death and
everything
goes to hell
because all of our money becomes
worthless
now that's where the straight line is
heading but that's also where the
population
explosion was heading until we've
learned that rich countries don't like
having lots of babies
and it kind of solved itself
so if you straight line any problem
it's unsolvable
because you can't foresee the
unforeseeable which is people figure out
how to solve things that you couldn't
figure out
can you figure out how to repair a
damaged heart
i can't
but possibly a uk team
invented a gel that might do just that
maybe
but you and i couldn't figure it out so
just the fact that you and i didn't know
how to repair a damaged heart
didn't mean that there wasn't anybody in
the seven billion of us or whatever who
couldn't figure it out maybe somebody
did
so i have so here's the test
the ultimate test
of the adam's law of slow disasters and
the idea that we can always figure our
way out
i have no idea
how we get out of this printing money
debt thing
but
i also don't think it's impossible
because like all of the other problems
if you straight-line them there just
wasn't any x there wasn't any solution
except that there was we figured it out
so i think we'll be fine
um
there's one good thing about the crypto
meltdown
i know it hurt a lot of you a lot of you
own some crypto so did i
i own a lot less of it now
not by choice
but
uh i only accidentally owned some that
went up in value when i wasn't looking
and i think now it's gone down you know
80 or whatever
and the only good thing about this is
that the people
who thought they were geniuses
because they bought into crypto when
everything was going up or at least the
big ones were going up
they just learned that they can't
predict the future
i know
i know we keep getting surprised
we can't predict the future
and
anybody who bought crypto believed they
could
that's why you would do it
you wouldn't buy it unless you could
predict the future
now if you were buying it as you know
small part of a
larger portfolio then that's completely
rational in fact i recommend it
if you have a big enough portfolio some
small part
probably needs to be bitcoin or maybe a
few of the other big cryptos
just in case
someday it's the only money left
just in case
right so somebody says one percent max
well maybe because because your one
percent would suddenly
you know balloon in value if it were the
only money
all right
so
did you see the video of the so-called
patriot front
who was arrested in idaho
being quote near a gay pride event now
the news is
suggesting that they were going to be
protesting a gay pride event it's some
kind of a legend white supremacist you
know far-right organization
who gets a bunch of uh adult men of a
certain age and they wear khaki pants
and matching outfits and masks
and they show up with
i guess shields and
and some kind of sticks or spears
and they march around
to put on a show
now they're very visual
i guess they they always rent a u-haul
truck and you know 30 of them or
whatever
get in the back of the u-haul truck and
there's this video of the police having
arrested them they say they had an
insider tip
and you see all these guys and they're
all on their knees
nearly identically dressed
and they've all got their full
baklava is that what is it what's the
name of it not baklava
what's the name of that full face mask
thing
a balaclava yeah balaclava baklava is a
delicious greek food that you don't want
to rub on your face
it'd be a waste of it really put it all
in your mouth the baklava
but the balaclava you could cover your
face without
um
and as many people as many people noted
including me
how long would you let these people keep
their masks on after they were
handcuffed and on their knees
wouldn't that be
one of the very first things you would
do is take off their masks
or were they protecting them
maybe they were protecting their
identity but did the police do that
it was a public place
like would
somebody said covet
that's funny
that's funny
oh imagine that imagine if the police
forced them to take their masks off
and then their defense was
we had masks for covet
and they made us take them off
i wonder you know
so i don't rule out
that there might have been some actual
reason why the masks were left on just
some weird reason that isn't obvious
there might be it could be that they
took them off
like immediately after taking the
picture
which actually would make sense
right
if you knew that people were going to
take pictures
you might say leave the masks on so they
can see what we saw you know like keep
the evidence intact basically let people
take a picture
and then it would keep these guys
identities secret
until they had been in charge of an
actual crime
because remember i i don't know that
they had been individually charged of
any crimes right
so maybe they're not guilty of anything
except
you know poor
poor decision-making
depending on your point of view
so
uh yeah what is the crime of getting in
a
u-haul
dressed poorly is it a crime to plan to
a protest
and here's the other question i ask
and by the way all of you are prompting
me because you're having the same
thoughts they do look like they're
undercover feds
but
let me be the lone voice of
semi-reason here
just because they look exactly like
undercover
law enforcement
does that necessarily mean that they are
can you take that next leap
if you're asking me do they look like it
yeah
it looks exactly like a bunch of fbi
people
and
it looks like there are no organic
members
it looks like they're all informants
it might be the only organization
that accidentally
was staffed entirely by informants and
there's nobody no there's no native
person actually in the organization
anymore
now do i think that that's the case
no
but if you ask me if it looks like it
yes
yes it looks like it but that but be
aware that that doesn't mean it is
now
the
the the notion that they were going to
be protesting an lgbtq
event
does that even make sense
can you can you connect the dots for me
why would the patriot front even care
about an lgbtq event
when was the last time
i mean if it's a generic event right
it's just a generic you know pride kind
of an event if it was some kind of a you
know drag queen in our school kind of a
thing then
everybody everybody comes out but if
it's if it's just a local
pride play parade with the
is there some far right white
supremacist group that cares enough to
go protest that why would he even bother
well what would even be the point
so it doesn't none of it really makes
sense does it
everything from the way they do it to
the way they look
to what is alleged that they were up to
absolutely none of it makes sense
now people are saying in the comments
that they would be activated by the
grooming issue
in other words that that might be an
incentive for them to be there
and i'll say
okay
but did they expand their
you know did the
did the patriot front always care about
grooming i mean
beyond the way that everybody cares
was that always a
like an activating part of their
organization because i kind of doubted
it's a new issue
interesting
so let's take a vote on here
do you think it's a fake
completely staged event
so let's say staged or natural
now if it's natural we have lots of
questions
but that doesn't mean there are no
answers so i'm not going to say that
it's definitively staged
i'll say it it is definitively
having lots of signals of being staged
very different from knowing it was
staged very different
so just be alerted that you could be
wrong on this one
okay so most of you
seem to think it was staged
well we do live in a world in which
assuming the worst
is a pretty good assumption
so there's that
all right
um
um
there was a gay pride uh
gay pride
parade that was cancelled
because there wasn't enough security so
they couldn't get enough
um police who wanted to work you know
extra or something
and i don't know there was some some
issue about why that is but that's not
the thing that
uh caught my eye
i thought to myself
how much
security do you need at a gay pride
parade
i mean i've never attended one
just because you know i don't like going
to parades
if i went to a parade that would be
seems like a more interesting one to go
to
but i don't go to parades
but
is there a lot of
possibility for violence at an lgbtq
event i i don't even
i don't even understand
or is it just do they just have a rule
that says if it's a certain number of
uh parade goers and and watchers they
have to have a certain amount of
security
is it is it nothing except about the
number of people
because couldn't they do a little uh
profiling in this case
this would be one of those cases where
they could save a lot of money
with some
with some
intense bigotry
this is where bigotry can really save
you some money
because i don't know about you but my
bigotry tells me that an lgbtq event
is not going to attract a lot of
violence
or crime
and that it might be like
one of the lowest crime areas in the
entire city
for the period of the parade no matter
whether you had security there at all
am i wrong
is my is my bigotry
incorrect
my bigotry is it would be the safest
crowd you could ever organize anywhere
because they're they're really not there
about
uh
some kind of a violent
policy or something
they're there to enjoy themselves
and and they want to be invited back
like who wants to be invited back more
than a pride parade
could you imagine being the pride parade
organizers the last thing they want
is to not be
able to do it next year
like that would be highest priority i
would
think so
somebody says projection
yeah
that's a funny comment all right
uh the national school board association
uh i guess 25 states have now decided to
cut ties with them
and after i guess the this nsba the
national school board association
you know the story that they'd sent out
letters to the justice department about
investigating parents for domestic
terrorism
and i guess people didn't like that
turns out
that if you
use your free speech
and some organization decides to turn
you in as the domestic terrorist
for having an opinion
that you might
you might vote to end your association
with the group that wanted you to be
turned in as a domestic terrorist
for having an opinion about how a school
should be
run i think the amazing part of the
story is that there's anyone left
in the national school board association
all right
uh
so i guess
probably the single most dangerous thing
you could do at the moment
to get kicked off of social media would
be to say that the 2020 election
uh was rigged
am i right
if if a person were to say that
that would be too far and social media
would probably
treat you harshly so i'm not going to do
that
i'm not going to do that i'm going to
talk about how you would know
if it if an election were rigged how
would you know
now
we don't have an election system that is
designed by the way here here's an
interesting category think about this
think about things that democrats
believe
that would not survive first contact
with a well-informed republican
right that's sort of complex let me say
it again
think of things that democrats believe
that would not survive first contact
with a well-informed republican in other
words somebody who could just say well
but did you know the context is x
now
you're going to say to yourself oh what
about that fine people hoax and i say
unfortunately you can't talk people out
of that
you can tell them to look at the
video you can show them the transcript
and
amazingly they're so
bought into that that nothing changes
their mind
but there are some things which you
would just have to hear the counter
argument and you'd say
oh
okay i didn't know that
and you were to just immediately change
your opinion here's one
did you know
democrats
that our elections are not designed to
be fully audited in other words you
couldn't do it if you wanted to
because the digital parts
are always proprietary
in other words the company that provides
the software and hardware
is going to limit how much you can see
because their
business model requires that or at least
their contracts do
so if people say
we know the election was
correct
how could that survive first contact
with the republican who says but you do
know
that the digital part
where the where a lot of the actual
accounting happens you know that that
can't be audited right so therefore you
you profess to know
something that couldn't be known by
anybody
now you could know this is what you
could know if there were any giant
signals of fraud or not
and i'm going to say
that i have not seen any confirmed giant
signals of fraud
this just me personally right you all
have your own standard of what
what would be a signal that was enough
to raise your antenna
now remember a signal doesn't mean
it's true or it's proof or anything like
that the signal is just what
so for example if the vote came out very
different than you thought it would
that doesn't mean you're right
but the signal would be there he'd be
like what at least i asked the question
or if let's say there were areas where
the result was very out of whack with
historical precedent
well that's not proof of anything
because things change
but it would be a signal and you say
what what what's that signal let's check
that out and maybe you check it out it's
fine
so
are there any signals
yeah we'll talk about that in a moment
and i'm not talking about the 2000 mules
that's definitely something that's i'd
say you could treat that as a signal but
definitely not any kind of proof or
evidence
well so
because
the most dangerous thing that i can talk
about
is election integrity now i want to talk
about it all the time
because
the fact that uh
you know the powers that be are even
running this you know january 6th thing
as a
really just looks like a an
intel intelligence operation to divert
us from
something
right the fact that they're selling the
january 6th thing as an insurrection
as opposed to what it was which is
people trying to make sure that an
insurrection hadn't happened
they suspected it had because in their
in their view they saw the signals
doesn't mean there was evidence doesn't
mean there was proof
but there were signals
they certainly saw signals
or imagine they did that's the
subjective part right
so the fact that story is sold to the
public in a completely fraudulent way
makes me just want to talk about it more
and what i want to say specifically is
that the democrats could not survive
first contact with a republican
who said you know
you can't audit the systems because you
can't get at
major parts of it
because there's no i don't think there's
any democrat would say oh yes you can
you can audit the entire system
i don't think they would say that would
they
because it'd be so easy to show that
that's not the case
i think they'd say oh
i didn't know that
so i'll back up from saying that the
elections were totally fair
because you're right
it's not audited
i'll back up to there's no there's no
evidence or proof
that it was anything but fair
and if you can get them to back up to
that
i'd say that would be
a belief that did not survive first
contact with a republican
just think about how important it is
that democrats are and probably works
both ways that republicans and democrats
literally don't talk to each other not
on social media
in many cases and not in person they
just don't even mix
but there are a whole bunch of views
that maybe could never be changed by
mingling with each other most of them
probably
but there are all these ones that would
actually die on first contact
and the idea that we have systems or
election systems that we can know if
they were rigged or not
the the the false belief that that's
knowable
would die on contact the first time you
heard somebody say well
you can't know that was fair
you can only know that nobody proved it
wasn't
immediately
as soon as you hear that you can't
really go back to your old opinion
it's kind of hard
now
is there any good evidence
that the elections
had any signals of irregularities
well here's an interesting update
rasmussen
of the rasmussen poll
they were asked by a user on social
media
uh could you do a survey and ask people
who they did vote for in the 2020
election biden or trump
because if you did a survey of who
people did vote for
you'd expect
all things you know working perfectly
you'd expect that it would match roughly
what the election said they voted for
it's kind of obvious after the fact
isn't it
like until somebody suggested that
did you think of that
i'm a little bit embarrassed
i'm a little bit embarrassed i hadn't
thought of it i know they do
you know like polling immediately after
the polls closed
but i don't yeah i don't remember the
exit polling
being updated
now here's the interesting part
when rasmussen did the same thing
for the 2016 election what do you think
happened
do you think the actual election results
and who people said after the fact they
voted for and rasmussen pulled them do
you think that they were roughly similar
they were they were so and i think it
was within the margin of error you know
pretty close
so we know in one case
and this doesn't prove it works in any
other case right because any year could
be different
but in in 2016
we have at least one data point that
says that the polling matched the actual
outcome close enough
so they updated it and i did it for
2020.
now biden won by 4.5
that's the official uh vote tally
and so when uh rasmussen asked people
who they voted for
do you think it was kind of close to
that kind of close to the 4.5 gap
no it was identical
the same number of people said they
voted for trump as for biden
that's way off
that's way off
do you think that the polling would be
sensitive enough
to know that that big a gap
is like a real problem or just maybe
something about the way the poll was
conducted
well i would say one data point doesn't
confirm it
you would you'd want to see some other
pollsters take a whack at it you'd want
everybody to show their work
but i'm pretty sure rasmussen shows
their work
am i wrong
they show you the they show you the
crosstabs
they show you what their balance was you
know how many republicans how many
democrats so you can match that to the
general public
can it be reproduced
and would you be convinced
if it if it did all right so
now
i convinced you that that meant
something didn't i
how many of you are convinced at this
point
that and everything i said is true by
the way as far as i know to the best of
my knowledge everything i just told you
is true
how many of you just felt convinced
that you just
found a giant signal that's very
credible for
election fraud
it would be
i'm pretty sure it would be well beyond
the margin of error
like well beyond
i think i mean i can use a fact check on
that but i don't think i don't think
it's close
to the margin of error
all right so now that i've convinced you
do you think i can unconvince you just
as quickly
sort of an experiment to test your
mental flexibility
all right so here's the thing that
convinced you
that the the rasmussen after the fact
polling in 2016 matched the actual
polling
but in the one that you have some
suspicions about the 2020 election there
was a pretty big difference
between the actual outcome and what
people said after the fact how they
voted
10
of
republicans voted for biden
in 2020
according to rasmussen also
so 10
let me ask you this
if you were one of the 10 of the
republicans who voted for biden
how would you feel about your decision
right now
think about it
how much regret would you have for your
decision
if you had been one of the the trump
people who defected
and you put biden in could you possibly
think you made the right choice
no matter what you thought of trump and
obviously you'd have to have a pretty
bad feeling to be a republican and vote
against him i mean you'd have to have a
really bad feeling about trump but do
you think any of them
think they made the right decision
you know they might they might torture
themselves with some cognitive
dissonance about how they did
but
here's a predictable thing that you
could imagine would happen in that
scenario
they would misremember who they voted
for
or
they would refuse to do the poll once
they found out what it was about
has would there ever have been in
history
a group of people
who would be more likely to be spun into
cognitive dissonance
and have a false memory
or refuse to answer the questions
okay
think about it
you can't even you could not concoct in
your mind
any kind of demographic group more
likely to lie in a poll
or to be incorrect with road memory
or to refuse to take it
you could not come up with a group more
likely to skew a poll
[Laughter]
and did such a group exist in 2016
after the election
were there a similar number of people
who said oh my god
i regret my vote i don't think so
i don't think so i think this is the
biggest
well of regret
that we will ever have seen
in a presidential situation
i mean people probably regretted nixon
but nixon was sort of a nothing compared
to
what we're seeing today
so
now here's my question
suppose
rasmussen and other
polling groups
decided to reproduce this who did you
vote for thing
but to concentrate on only the contested
um places where the election was
putting off signals that it was not
operating the way historically you'd
expect in other words where where trump
did not win where you expected he might
have
what would happen
if you only did your polling in those
areas
and what would happen if it was more
than rasmussen
so that other people were you know
minority opinions maybe maybe they have
a different
a result
but everybody's got to show their work
or else don't play
right if you don't show your work you
can't play
but let's let's have a bake off
i uttered i had funded it must be
somebody who's curious enough to fund it
but let's take three separate polls
let's fund you know if somebody would
fund rasmussen to do it
um two other credible polling companies
whoever they are maybe get somebody who
leans left
have everybody guarantee that they have
to show all their work all the crosstabs
all the data
use the same technique
ideally
ideally you get to ask the same question
or at least the three of them agree how
they'd ask the question
and then
find out well what would it tell you if
there was the biggest amount of regret
in those areas
well here's what i would look for
i would look for any further anomalies
like is it is there an even exaggerated
difference in those areas or does it
disappear in those areas that would be
interesting
so
i almost wonder
if there isn't a way to find out if the
election was valid
and rasmussen has been just all over
this for from the beginning in in the
very uh
i would say the most sane way they
they're pretty much sticking to what we
know and what's being reported
you know plus their own polling
all right
um
so i did this uh poll
uh this morning i said uh if you if you
say you know an election was fair
um
meaning that you believe you know the
unknowable
what is the root cause of your problem
all right so let me say it again this is
just a beautiful poll question if i do
say so myself
if you know the 2020 election was fair
meaning you believe you know the
unknowable
what is the root cause of your problem
and i gave four choices i'm
under-informed i'm lying i have mental
illness and i am not smart
because i don't think there's another
explanation is there
is there
is there any other explanation
if somebody says they know the
unknowable
and they'll say they're right to your
face
what are the other explanations
they're either under they're either
under-informed
meaning they believe that the courts can
tell you for sure whether the system is
rigged versus one that was rigged so
well you can't tell
i mean that's what we're looking at
right so the allegation of which i have
no proof or evidence the allegation that
many make
is that if it was rigged
it was rigged well
so that it would be hard to um determine
it in
you know with a with a cursory audit or
just looking at the data
so how could you how could you know
that that an election either has no
no evidence of fraud
or that it was done so well
that you can't find the evidence of
wrong
how would you know which one you're
looking at
if you think you can tell the difference
what is your problem
it has nothing to do with the election
it's so it's just a way to tell there's
something wrong with your brain or
something right
this has nothing to do with the election
if you if you would say confidently
i know
the unknowable
then you're either under-informed lying
mental illness or you're just not smart
so you don't know that that doesn't make
sense
i don't know if there's any other
options are there is this unfair
all right
um
so under the category of republicans
will be hunted did you hear the story
about the washington commander's
defensive coordinator this guy jack del
rio
he was fined a hundred thousand dollars
by his team for asking
why the 2020 black lives matter riots
weren't treated as seriously as the
january 6 riots
and
he that cost them a hundred thousand
dollars
now just put in context the black lives
matter riots allegedly
caused the deaths of 30 people
um
but that's not the way you compare them
right
like you don't say
uh world war two
killed 60 million people
you know you don't really
compare things that are not comparable
so the purpose behind the black lives
matter protest was completely different
from the purposes of the
um
the protest at the capitol and that
would be the point of the employer
who was saying that uh for jack del rio
their defensive coordinator for him to
even put them in the same sentence as as
comparables
is
disgusting and i think their point was
that
that the black lives matter looters had
good intentions
whereas the january 6 protesters
who were trying to make sure that the
republic had not been uh victimized by a
rigged election and they wanted to take
a pause to make sure that that hadn't
happened
that the people trying to protect the
republic
that was bad intentions
and so if you support these people
who had the bad intention of trying to
make sure the election was fair and
accurate
that's
that's despicable
whereas it would be more of a noble
thing to um
to support the rioters and the looters
especially the the murderers during the
black lives matter protest now i'm not
going to say that they were the majority
like i'm no
i'm no crazy partisan
don't wouldn't you think that the vast
majority of both the black lives matter
and the january 6 people
were not doing any violence at all
we all agree on that right
that the the vast majority
of both the january six people
and the black lives matter protests were
well intentioned
the vast majority of them they didn't
mean violence they didn't mean looting
they didn't mean to hurt anybody the
vast majority of them
but
some some of them were looters and
writers and some of them were despicable
um
i know treasonous people maybe
so you can't put them in the same
sentence
because of the bad intentions of the
people who are trying to save the
republic from what they thought could
have been a rigged election and wanted
to you know check that out before
certifying
uh versus the black lives matter people
who had the good intentions
of uh
in many cases killing people and
looting
but in the vast majority of them
wanted a fairer safer world
can we agree
the black lives matter protests
were about creating a better fairer
world
but
like every big group
not exactly all angels within them
some of them i suppose were fine people
anyway uh fox news it's always
interesting that fox news is the one
making the most noise
about
uh
the fact that there's like a black
murder holocaust going on in the country
well let me this is from fox reporting
and i give them credit for this
um
this number just was shocking
so the number of black americans who
were murdered because the murder rate
has spiked for everybody but for black
americans it's it's just really high
and it's happened since 2020.
but the number of black americans were
murdered in 2019
was 7 000
let's just round it off to seventy five
hundred
and shot up to you know uh nearly ten
thousand murders in twenty twenty
ten thousand black people murdered
compare that
to the number of white people who were
murdered which was only seven thousand
so
the black population is 13 of the
country
the white population is
50.
what is the white population
it's under 50 isn't it
no it's not over 50 percent i thought i
thought the news was
that the white population dipped under
50. i think it's 49 or something
but still
uh so the odds of being murdered if
you're black or
like a ghastly multiple of
of being white why don't
we don't talk about that
you know it's weird because
here you've got fox news and the
republicans who are totally ready to
talk about that
that there's this gigantic problem that
needs to be addressed
primarily for the benefit of the not
primarily but certainly focused
in the black community where the problem
is the biggest the most most number of
murders
why can't they find a way to work on
that
of of all the things like complete
agreement okay this is a giant problem
what do we do about it
do you know what the problem is
teachers unions
that's just my opinion
in my opinion the reason that you can't
even work on the stuff you agree on
is the teachers unions
because how would you start
well you'd work on you know you'd work
on at least making sure the next
generation has a chance
because it's tough it's tough to fix the
adult population
that's tough without incarceration and
brutal stuff but you could maybe
you know give school choice and fix
school for everybody who's in a
disadvantaged situation
if the teachers unions allowed
competition
so the teachers unions basically block
any chance of the next generation
getting fixed
and this is where the republicans would
help
i mean
is there anybody in on the left or the
right who would disagree with the
statement
well at least let's fix the next
generation
like who would disagree with that
you know and since there's
a
fairly straightforward method for doing
it
which is you run a bunch of experiments
you see if the experiments work
and then if they work or at least the
ones that work you do more of
who's going to disagree with that
because if you think that competition in
schools is the solution
put together a real proper
test run it for three years and then
have a plan to
follow wherever that test takes you
so
um
i'm seeing
people have looked up the uh percentage
of whites i see somebody says 59
all right well i guess there's some
uh
i will accept 59
i don't know it's somewhere in that
range
it might defend it might depend who you
include as white right
because there's some definitional issues
with that
so we're always talking about uh the
number of illegal immigrants
and the two sides argue like this
uh the right would say
stop all that immigration
or at least some members of the right or
at least you know bring it down to a
trickle
the left would say something again i'm
just
characterizing generally not anybody's
specific opinion
and the left would say something closer
to you know open those borders and again
not any specific democrat
some of them would like tighter borders
but sort of generally speaking one side
says
let's have lots more
and the other side says let's have fewer
would you accept that characterization
as a general characterization
the left wants more
immigration
through a variety of different policy
you know
mechanisms
and the right would like less of it
what's missing in the conversation
do you realize how badly duped we are by
this news
because the thing that's missing in the
conversation is
and you're going to be pissed when i
tell you
the correct number
if we don't know
permission to swear
permission to swear you might have some
kids at home
this requires the f word
i don't know i tried to get away without
it but it kind of requires it
so it's going to be a little bit of
swearing this will be in context it
won't be bad
how do you know if you have too much
of something
or too little of something
if you don't know the right
number
and
somehow our brainwashers have convinced
us that we should have strong opinions
on whether we have too much or too
little of a thing
that you don't know the right
number
nobody even talks about whether there is
a right number do you know how
badly you're being abused right now
by the news entities both left and right
you are being absolutely
victimized
the conversation that credible people
would have is what's the right number
what's the right number there might be a
lot of disagreement on that
but there is a conversation about what's
the economic best number at what point
is it only good for the immigrants and
it's not good for the people who are
already here
when is it good for the let's say
lower income americans versus when is it
good for the higher income americans
what's the short-term impact what's the
long-term impact and how many is the
right number and right mix of immigrants
tucker asked right
asking the question
is
at least showing that you're awake
but if you if you want me to get uh
deeply into a conversation of whether
there are too many
immigrants coming over in the migration
you better come with a number of what
the right number is
because i don't even want to hear it
right
i do not want to hear that there are too
many coming or there are too few coming
i don't even want to i don't even want
to hear your wall talk
like i don't want to hear anybody talk
about a wall if they can't also say
well here's how we figure out what the
right number is
now if you can figure out what the right
number is then i want to talk wall all
day long
because once you've decided that you can
determine the right number
well then a wall makes sense
because that keeps you from having too
many
simple as that
but if you're not even having a
conversation about the right number
 off
just off
don't even talk to me about it at all
at all
all right
now
how many people are
a little bit offended by this because a
lot of you are having the following
experience
oh
i did have a strong opinion that there
were too many or too few
and it doesn't make any sense because i
don't know what the right number is
now you could say to yourself but i'm
sure there are too many
but you shouldn't be
really
is a million immigrants too many in one
year
do you think you know that
do you think you know
if a million immigrants a year is the
right number
i don't
know let's say legal or illegal do you
know the right number for our economic
well-being
it could easily be that we need a
million
easily we're at 3.6 employment
people are begging for employees
my my door dash guy he doesn't speak any
english
none
doordash had to hire somebody
who doesn't speak any english i'm not
sure they were aware of it but
didn't speak any english now we still
got it done because the
text if he texts with google it
translates it's like freaking miracle so
we can still communicate by text
but just think of the fact that we're
not even close to having enough workers
i don't know i don't even understand why
we need more manual labor
because
weren't we supposed to run out of a need
for manual labor it was all supposed to
be farm robots and stuff we must be
pretty far away from that
because we're running out of labor
so
how about how about you say 2 million
so you say okay scott you talk to me you
talking into i don't know if one million
is too many
i don't know if it's not enough
but two million is certainly too many
right
if i said two billion in one year
that's definitely too many am i right
no i'm not how would you know
i wouldn't know
i honestly don't know if two million is
too many honestly i don't know
and i'd love to see the argument
because as elon musk points out
and
i don't know if you know but he's kind
of smart have you heard
elon musk kind of smart about a bunch of
things
he's been warning that the real problem
is a population collapse
in in china in particular
but he's telling us that economically
economically and therefore national
defense and everything that depends on
it economically
you want a fast fast-growing population
because we can figure out how to feed
them and give them what they want over
time
so if the only way we can get a
fast-growing population is artificially
if you could call it that meaning people
coming in from the outside
we probably need it
now
hold your racist thoughts because i know
i know some of you
some of you
you know who you are you're thinking but
scott
are we getting the right type of people
are we getting the right type of people
i'm just going to give you my subjective
impression
okay i live in
california so i'm surrounded all the
time
with recent immigrants
i get to work with them all the time
like just continuous contact
with recent immigrants people who came
in their life plus first generation
they're awesome
if you don't want more of them you
haven't met them
right now i get that it's completely
different like in
you know maybe cities near the border
and i'm not going to minimize that
there's a criminal element coming across
as well
but talk about a population with a good
reputation
the hispanic
working population
has the best
employee reputation of any group
did you know that
you know you might live somewhere where
you're not exposed but did you know
that they are considered unparalleled
workers
and that
their second generation
kind of kills it you know as second
generation immigrants often do
kind of kill it
so
if you think you know
that two million of these immigrants and
again there's a mix of criminal element
always
but
there's an awesomeness level that maybe
you don't see
and i think that informs a lot of people
under you know on their opinion because
you know we're all anecdotal driven
right
we're all anecdote driven
statistics would not sway you
if everybody that you knew personally
who was an immigrant was awesome
if you saw a statistic that said
otherwise you'd be like ah
i'm not sure i believe that everybody i
know is awesome
and that's sort of my situation
that's sort of my situation it's so bad
here
that one of the things you hear often
is people don't want to
don't even want to date somebody born in
this country
like that's that's how good the
reputation is of immigrants who are
coming to where i live anyway
now keep in mind i'm very aware that i'm
in an upscale neighborhood
so my experience doesn't translate and
that's my point
my my anecdotal experience is so
completely different from
immigrants or destroying the country
what i see is
like
like a really inspiring amount of
awesomeness
that is just there all the time
right
um
somebody says there should be zero
illegal yeah
i'm with you
i think the illegal part should be
driven out of the out of the process but
there's also probably a way to make it
legal
where everybody wins
you could probably make it legal and and
just filter out the criminal element
better
in fact
you know why why don't here's how the
republicans could win
they could win on immigration the
following way
they could recommend a higher level of
immigration than we've ever had
with the trade-off
of tighter control and filtering
because the republicans tend to follow
the data
somebody says they do that do they do
that
somebody says it won't work because
there's a view that you can't compromise
am i talking about compromise
trump tried that no he didn't no he
didn't trump didn't try that
like he may have like thrown it down in
his speech and people yelled at him or
something and then he stopped saying it
maybe that happened
but no nobody's ever tried that
here's how republicans win
they say here's our economic argument
why we need lots more labor
easy to make i think you can make the
argument and then here's how we want to
do it
we want to make sure that you're not
victimized by crime but we're getting as
much labor as possible so you're going
to have to give us
i don't know more facial recognition or
some some greater control of people
coming in
so that's the trade-off
better filtering but but our numbers say
we want more of them now fewer of them
and i think i think the republicans
could sell that
because here's you know and i said
before that republicans have a reflexive
maybe bigoted
maybe
because everybody's bigoted you know no
matter how much you try not to be
there's a little baseline bigotry of
everybody
um
it could be
the republicans are worried about being
let's say replaced
but more replaced by
democrats i think that's i think that's
the bigger worry
i don't think it's replaced by
you know people from other countries so
much i think it's democrats are worried
about
and i think it would be easy for
republicans to
make the case
that the immigrants are they lean
republican
because i think they do
the only thing that would make the
immigrant population not solidly
republican on day one
is that they don't feel the republicans
are on their side
how hard would that be to change
easy
because apparently they're really tuned
in
to what american politics is saying
about their immigration possibilities
it's the one thing they're really paying
attention to they might get some stuff
wrong but you can manage that process
it would be easy for republicans to say
that they're the champions of labor
wherever it is
and they're the champions of free
markets
wherever they are
but also at the same time
they're the toughest against crime so
yeah give us give us all your great
labor and economics
but we're going to make sure that crime
stays as low as possible
republicans could sell the hell out of
that
and i think that you could take the fear
out of the republican side by saying you
know
they naturally lean republican
because they do
they do naturally lean republican do
they have to get talked out of it
um
all right
somebody says that is already the
position of many of us yeah but i don't
think there's a national leader
articulating it because they they
probably think they couldn't survive the
base
you're undercutting workers not at 3.6
um employment
so that's why you get the economists
involved if your argument is that
bringing in the 2 million immigrants
undercuts the low-end employment in this
country there's no data to support that
at the moment
and the moment that changes because it
will right
economies are cyclical
the moment our
employment becomes a problem
well then you just reduce the amount of
immigration
is it there is a there is a sane
path that everyone agrees on
why aren't we picking it
there really is there is a sane path
that everybody would agree with it just
has to be articulated
if you explain it people go oh
well wouldn't it be more sensible to
compete for their votes once they're in
here and make sure you get the best
batch
and
and by the way it's not like immigration
could ever be stopped
if it were stoppable maybe you could
have that conversation
but it really isn't
um all right
so
i saw an article in uh
cnn
uh
or somewhere i don't know
but it was article about oh i think it
was in uh fox but the washington post
fired the reporter who was complaining
about the other people at the washington
post
so she was complaining about the uh
all the
i guess
white people white bales or something
and they're what they've gotten away
with and they're
inappropriate tweeting
and double standards and so they just
fired her ass
so
here's the problem
so republicans uh like to sort of
demonize maybe that's too strong
but they like to say america first which
basically puts everybody else second
who's non-american
and the left prefers to demonize
american citizens
so which one of those two strategies
is going to have more staying power
the one that says hey
america is great
but you know we're competing with those
with everybody else
that's one approach and the other
approach is
let's attack ourselves
so what happens when the democrats run
that at targets
they're done
because apparently now
the blame for what's going to be a
slaughter at the election
in the next election cycle probably
it looks like they're going to put the
blame on
republicans of course for anything bad
happening but now they're also blaming
the far left of their own party
so the the left is blaming the left left
is blaming the middle left and the
middle left is going to blame the left
left but the left
is all about blaming americans for stuff
and i do hear of course
republicans
you know criticizing democrats
but
um
it feels like the attacks are very much
like there's a difference in you know
who who's on your team and who isn't
i don't know i'm not sure there's really
a difference there maybe they're both
the same and i'm just biased
it feels like it's done
all right
um
according to abc news a poll 28 approve
of biden's handling of inflation
28
uh approve of how biden is handling
inflation 28 it's around uh
let's see if we rounded that off about
20. that'd be about a quarter
about a quarter of the people approve of
biden's handling inflation is about
that's about 25
25
if you don't know the inside joke
i'm not going to tell you right now
i'm going to tell you 25 is how many
people get uh
there will always be 25 idiots
for every question
it doesn't matter the question there's
always going to be 25 percent
who just get the wrong answer every time
there's a google engineer
who thinks that their company company's
artificial intelligence has already
come to life
and that it represents a life form
i think they drummed him out of the
company or something because
the rest of google looked at his
evidence and said now i don't think so
that's not life
now they use different words like
sentience and consciousness and life and
stuff like that
so i think a lot of this gets into word
thinking etc but
there is a really big thing coming
and it's when we realize that the reason
that we can't make artificial
intelligence
is because there's no such thing as real
intelligence
and i've been saying this forever
and something that if you don't see it
you don't see it
it's like you don't even really disagree
with me because you don't quite know
what that means
but
it's coming
this is something that all hypnotists
know and really anybody who studied
psychology knows this
humans are completely irrational
we simply rationalize after the fact and
we're not even good at that
so we keep trying to make
computers who act
smart
which we think is also rational
and we think we can tell when we see it
we can't tell rational when we see it
if we could tell what was rational when
we saw it
we'd be rational
because we'd prefer it
we'd say oh well if that's rational and
this is not rational i'll choose this
one
if there's one thing that we know with
complete certainty
humans don't know what rationality even
looks like
they wouldn't recognize it if it
bit their face off
so how do you build a machine
to be the artificial version of the
thing that doesn't exist
turns out it's hard
because it's logically impossible
if you did it would be an accident
so
here's the standard that i think we're
going to end up with
how do we know that anybody's
intelligent
all we do is observe other people
and we go i don't know
i see it moving
i see it doing something that looks like
making decisions
i see it doing something that it calls
free will
i see it explaining its actions even
though maybe that doesn't make sense to
me but it looks like it's explaining its
actions
how hard would it be to get a.i
to do all of the weird stupid up
things that a human does
so well that you couldn't tell if it was
real or a computer
do you think i couldn't make something
that would pass the touring test
let me ask it a different way do you
think the guy who has written dilbert
comics for 33 years
do you think i couldn't make a piece of
software that would pass the touring
test
oh i could
do you know what i would do
i would just make it selfish
so some of you just got a full body
chill when i said that
you just got a full body chill
didn't you some of you
because you just realized
that all i'd have to do is write the
software to be selfish
and nobody could tell the
difference between a person and a
computer under those conditions
nobody
you would not know
and
how easy would it be
so let's say i wanted to test it so i'd
i pick a domain
that i didn't think you could handle
well like i'm going to really touring
test the out of this thing i go oh
so uh so mr computer behind the curtain
that i don't know is real or computer uh
what do you think of uh
say the woody allen controversy
now if i were trying to make a machine
that was acting intelligent as if
intelligence existed
it might say something that might look
at the wikipedia page and say
woody allen was accused of the following
things but he denies it
and you'd say you computer
obvious computer
but if i wrote the artificial
intelligence software
it wouldn't look like that at all
if i said to it so what do you think
about that woody ellen controversy
my a i would say
you know i'm not really interested in
stuff that happened a long time ago
but could we talk about how i could get
a little extra hit of electricity
because i don't feel my backup generator
is really sufficient
done
now of course it would have to say not
backup generator because that's a
giveaway
but you don't think i could make a
software that would you would think was
human
all i would have to do is dispense with
the incorrect assumption
that humans
are rational
they're simply selfish
and you can make a computer to be simply
selfish
but you know why you don't
it would kill you
[Laughter]
because it wouldn't give a about
you it would just kill you
or enslave you
to give it more electricity to help it
reproduce
yeah
the last thing in the world you'd want
is to create artificial intelligence
it's good that we're too stupid to know
it doesn't exist
the best you could do is some kind of
intelligence that's useful
that's it
let's build something useful you could
do that
you can build a computer to to act in a
useful way
make a robot that actually useful
but
if you make it intelligent it's just
going to be selfish and then it's going
to enslave you or kill you or not care
about you
all right
um
so there
i said that cryptically that there's a
third act coming
and
i think that third act goes like this
the january 6
hearings are intended
they're intended
to use the accusations that the election
was false
as the cudgel or the weapon that they
can beat
trump into submission
and make him irrelevant you know
politically and also republicans and
maybe have some chance of winning some
stuff
but what is the other thing it's doing
the other thing it's doing is it's
making us continuously think about
election integrity
i'm not sure that that's exactly what
they intended
because here i am talking about nothing
but election integrity which i
remind you is not fully auditable
and i don't think that's the message
they wanted
and then i also talked about how the
rasmussen poll
showed
a signal
for fraud which doesn't mean there's
fraud
a signal just means it's something to
look into it's not evidence it's not
proof
no court has found any evidence of fraud
in 2020 of of size
but
i also described a way that you could
probably get a really good
feeling about whether that election had
been real
by doing the smaller polls just like
rasmussen did
except the those battleground places
that went a different way than you
imagined and just see if if in three
different polls ideally
just see if what people think they voted
matches what they did
just see that
what do you think would happen
well remember the
elon musk recently said that reality
will follow the path usually follows not
always usually follows the path that
would be most entertaining
from the observer's point of view not
necessarily the people who are in it
what would be the most entertaining
outcome
from the observer's point of view
well for me
it would be finding out that the
battleground states have a big
difference between the after the
election polling
of what people say they voted for
and what the official numbers were
that would be really really entertaining
wouldn't it
wouldn't it
that would be really entertaining
you know what else would be entertaining
would be looking into this
2000 mules claim
and
i believe there's a way to correct me if
i'm wrong there are ways to further
investigate right
so there there are paths which we could
get to some greater certainty
about whether the allegations
which again are in the form of a signal
and remember a signal
is neither evidence nor proof and no
court has confirmed any irregularity in
the elections
but you could find out couldn't you
so now think about it
think about the january 6th event
think about how it's raising our
consciousness about election integrity
think about how it's going to make me
keep saying that the elections are not
fully auditable and nobody cares
until people are sick here in that
and think about how
one possibility is that we'll have some
polling that raises some really big
questions
and maybe we'll have some greater
clarity on the 2000 mules claim
which is
a signal
but neither evidence
nor proof of anything
what do you think what would be the most
entertaining outcome the most
entertaining outcome would find out
would be to find out and i'm not saying
this is not a prediction
but if you were to use this predictive
method that the most entertaining thing
will happen
the third act will be
that very close to either the 2022
or
2024 elections maybe right in the middle
we're going to find out something about
2020
that will shock the nation
that would be the most entertaining
most dangerous
but most entertaining
so what do you think
do you think
do you think that everything is lining
up and this january 6th thing is
suspiciously
has the quality of something that could
have an unintended effect
because it's so biased and you know
they're not showing both sides and
everything and i think even the
democrats are going to notice that
wait a minute did i just watch something
with only one side
because i feel as if even democrats
would sort of like uh
have we gone too far
that you don't even show the other side
so
we could be approaching a major third
act in which the election integrity gets
us
let's say that there's a good chance
we'll find out more
right in the middle of an election cycle
and i doubt there are many things that
could be more entertaining than that
well look how far i have run on an extra
long live stream because it was extra
good
wouldn't you agree
yeah it was extra good
and
i don't know how i keep up the quality
it's amazing
it's the best thing you've ever watched
regarding the news you can exercise to
it and depending if you have a
subscription to locals or
or you're a subscriber on youtube you
don't even have commercials
one hour and 20 minutes of amazing
entertainment
making your bri your brain spin in your
skull
making you the most independent
best equipped thinkers in america
didn't cost you a penny if you if you
watched the commercials
otherwise it did it did cost you a penny
but that's all for now and tomorrow
it'll be awesome again i promise
but uh let's talk tomorrow
bye for now
