foreign
do you know what we're going to be
talking about today
well let me give you a preview it's
going to involve uh truckers zuckers uh
suckers possibly Tucker and maybe a few
cuckers
that's right
and
today and only today we're going to do a
special simultaneous salute
to one of the people on this list the
truckers
who would like to join me in a
simultaneous sip specifically for the
freedom Convoy the truckers in Canada
who I understand
Sometimes some of them listen to this
podcast
and so if you happen to be in your truck
right now and you're listening again
this is a big thank you for for those of
us watching coffee with Scott Adams this
morning and uh if you'd like to join in
in saluting the the truckers all you
need is that cover my girl glass a
tanker jealous is Diana canteen
geographlask a vessel of any kind
in this case a truck
shortly with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day and
the salute to the Canadian truckers go
oh yeah
now
we'll talk about that in a moment a
little bit more but what is happening
there are so many stories and they're so
delicious today
all the stories are delicious
doesn't matter what you're doing
be you running on the beach Joel Joel
or
be you working out on your Peloton Greg
whatever you're doing right now
even if you're taking a shower Erica
Erica
whatever you're doing
these stories are gonna entertain you
uh so I don't know but it's starting to
look like the Biden Administration
played Russia
approximately right
because I think Russia doesn't have a
play
it's starting to look like we we we're
going to call their Bluff
and it's looking like it's going to be a
bluff now it's too early to tell and
everybody will tell you but Putin he's
got Tricks up his sleeve and he does
but
I haven't heard of what he could do that
would make any sense of you
there's there's not much much of a play
there
so it could be that Biden actually
by just calling his bluff
it might be exactly the right play we'll
see
I I still think the better play would be
to reframe our whole situation because
it just doesn't make sense
to be at war with Russia in any way he
just doesn't make any sense
well here's my possibly favorite story
of the day although there are a lot of
good ones today and this comes out of
wired
apparently North Korea hacked a hacker
in the United States
it looks like they were trying to get a
hold of some of the hacking tools that
the hacker had but the hacker in the
United States was a little bit better at
this stuff than the North Korean hackers
and not only did they not get anything
of value
but they really pissed him off
and so I would like to read to you what
the article in wired said because they
it's just written so deliciously
but responsibility for North Korea's
ongoing Internet outages doesn't lie
with the U.S cyber command or any other
state-sponsored hacking agency in fact
it was the work of one American man in a
t-shirt pajama pants and slippers
sending you this living room night after
night watching Alien movies and eating
spicy corn snacks and periodically
walking over to his home his home office
to check on the progress of the programs
he was running to disrupt the internet
of an entire country
[Laughter]
which apparently he successfully did
he took down North Korea's internet
but wait
I just this is just so it because the
writing is so good
from wired
just over a year ago an independent
hacker who goes by the handle p4x was
himself hacked by North Korean spies uh
before p4x was just one with one victim
of a hacking campaign that targeted
Western Security researchers with the
apparent aim of stealing their hacking
tools and details about software
vulnerabilities
he says he managed to prevent those
Hackers from swiping anything of value
but he nonetheless felt deeply unnerved
by state-sponsored hackers targeting him
personally
and by the lack of any visible response
from the U.S government
so he just decided to take down their
government
or at least their internet
and he did
so uh one of the themes today is when
you think one person can't make a
difference
Apparently one person is the always
makes a difference
there's probably nothing that ever
didn't start with one person
you know even even the Wright brothers
they probably didn't have the airplane
idea simultaneously right it was
probably one of them I don't know which
one
Orville Wilbur Maybe
I think one of them said hey bro
I got an idea
bicycles to airplanes everything starts
with one person
um so I guess we shouldn't be too afraid
of North Korea so the internet can be
crashed by one mad guy eating popcorn
um here's more news about fusion fusion
technology coming
so right down the road for me uh
literally bicycle distance from me
uh a team at the national ignition
facility at Lawrence Livermore National
Labs
uh they've done another breakthrough in
Fusion now skipping the technical
description of the Breakthrough that I
wouldn't understand if I read it to you
anyway
apparently other people say quote the
results are a big deal so people who do
know what they're talking about
say that as I've been telling you now
for a number of years
further confirmation
that were past the scientific phase and
were well into the engineering phase
and the engineering phase is the phase
that can't be stopped
the the scientific phase could be
stopped if there's something you need to
discover that's undiscoverable you know
maybe it's just not there or you can't
find it but once you get the engineering
stage that's sort of a virtuous slippery
slope
meaning that we are going to a b our
tester it looks like there's nothing
that would stop us from a b testing our
way to Fusion
five years 10 years 20 years not five
but
it looks like we're gonna we're gonna
have some good stuff while most of us
are still alive
so that's a big deal
uh of course we're going to talk about
CNN's head Jeff Zucker
now I heard it pronounced Zucker not
Zucker
is does anybody know the proper
pronunciation
well anyway
I'll I'll do it any way I want but
apparently he uh resigned because he did
not too soon enough he says reveal his
uh developing relationship with a
person in the CNN executive area named
Alison golust
now it has to be pointed out that you
can't spell Allison go lust
without
all and lust
we'll call that a coincidence
now
he says he's only leaving because these
two divorced people who were adults had
a consenting relationship in which they
both had sufficient power and a 20-year
relationship so it doesn't look like
anything bad happened in terms of
what anybody would care about but here's
what I love about this story
everybody would agree whether you love
or hate Zucker
that he's really smart and he you know
he was a sort of the Boy Wonder and you
know did a lot of things early and so
you he's a smooth operator and look what
he managed to do
he managed to time his own Scandal if
you could even call it that it's so
small
after after all of these CNN scandals
they were so much worse
so when you hear oh no
Jeff Zucker has a some kind of sex
related Scandal what is it
are you kidding me
two consenting single adults
what we're both you know similarly
powered you know it wasn't like a power
indifference of any you know meaning
um
that is good timing
there is a man who knows how to make an
exit
am I right
now apparently he was going to leave at
the end of the year anyway and and uh
the ratings were in the toilet
so everything was looking like you
probably wanted to get out of there as
soon as possible so I think he seized on
an opportunity to get out early
when I'll betcha
I'll bet you he didn't want to be there
because when you've already quit or you
know you're going to be gone at the end
of the year how much fun is it to work
for those months when you've already
quit
that's like the worst thing isn't it
what what could be a smoother move than
finding out a way to leave in Scandal
I'm leaving in Scandal because of my
relationship with a Consulting adult of
similar power
oh my God
this this I don't think this could be
any smarter
and then because he quits he also uh
cuts off the ability or really the
incentive to ask more questions
do you think do you think that he wants
to answer more questions about this
situation
nope because some of those answers might
not be
maybe exactly favorable to him or to
somebody else right so he he gets out of
having to ask any questions he gets out
when his scandal if you could even call
it that I don't think it is at all but
it because of the context of all the
worse accusations it looks like he's the
best person on CNN really that's all
that's all you had
that's all you had
all your whole Scandal was at wow you're
like the purest person to the whole
network there
so it was kind of genius and I think
that uh this is he used a diversion
narrative
so I think by connecting it to you know
these sexual improprieties
he's created a diversion that is clearly
trying to take our take us away from
whatever it is he doesn't want us to ask
about it is so clever it you know for
somebody who is in a situation and you
know he was in the situation right so he
knew it was going to come out and it was
going to be a story
ah you can't handle a thing better than
this this is really well handled from a
public relations timing everything else
it makes it look like he just fell on
his sword and he just got everything he
wanted
including including a woman apparently
now the most surprising things about
this story story were I just learned
that uh Jeff Zucker and Brian stelter
are two different people
did you know that
there are actually two different people
I just I just thought it was sort of a
Superman situation where uh Brian
stelter would be you know you wouldn't
wouldn't know him mild-mannered but then
he would put on those wire room glasses
and then he would be Jeff Zucker well
that's what I thought it was but it
turns out they're just two completely
different people uh I believe the
backstory is they they met at a uh some
convention of some sort
people look like thumbs but
um
anyway
that had to be said
you know this is the news that has to be
said it's not even the news that
is Illuminating it's just the stuff that
has to be said
sometimes just things have to be said
that's all
well speaking of
uh nuclear stuff uh forget about Fusion
which is probably going to happen too
but the European Union just went ahead
and reframed
I like to use that word they reframed
nuclear energy as well as natural gas as
maybe green energy
what what it's about time
how many how many times have I am
you know lots of lots of you as well
it's just something everybody in this
audience has probably said a million
times that it's the greatest of the
green energy and you know uh as Michael
schellenberger often points out
the uh
one of the reasons that we haven't
contributed as much to greenhouse gases
is because of natural gas use
so it is perfectly sensible that the
European Union will press ahead with it
now it's a proposal it doesn't mean it's
going to get approved right so it's just
a proposal
but the fact that this is even being
proposed
by the European Union shows that there's
a you know big shift in mindset
and
this is one of the very few times you
see the extreme right or or just maybe
the entire right and the entire left
converging on the same solution
it's kind of weird isn't it
I think everybody's and and didn't
didn't I tell you and other people told
you right I'm not the only person to say
it but it was inevitable we were going
to get here the easiest kind of
persuasion
is what is going to happen anyway
it's really hard to take something that
wasn't going to happen and then just
make it happen that takes a lot of skill
a lot of work a lot of energy but
sometimes things are going to happen on
their own and you just give it a you
know give it a little fake because we're
a little push and at this point that
simple reframing just just think how how
important it is to reframe things
the if this
if this proposal becomes reality
the European Union will have reframed
nuclear and natural gas as Green
Solutions what does that do to
everything
better right
it makes everything better like though
everything in the whole world better I
was talking yesterday I mean that sounds
like an exaggeration but it isn't it's
not an exaggeration it literally will
just make everything better because if
you make energy less expensive and more
ubiquitous
even if you didn't care about the
climate just having you know more
inexpensive energy makes literally
everything better
and and this energy is green and green
enough in the in the case of gas
that is just all good
it's a reframe with no downside
basically very rare
well here's the most interesting news of
the day
I want to tell you
that what I'm gonna
talk about is all true
because it would be so so interesting
but we're gonna have to wait to see what
the evidence is right so I'm going to
say get your popcorn
because this could either be really
really good
or it could be Al Capone safe we don't
know yet right this is going to be
binary though this is either going to be
really really big or nothing
and it's a Dinesh D'Souza movie coming
out called 2000 mules
mules being a description of a couriers
or humans who who take things usually
elicit you know illegal stuff from one
place to another
and the claim on the teaser or the
trailer for The mules movie the 2000
mules movie
is that now this is the claim
now I'm not I'm not going to tell you
this is true because I don't want to be
canceled by social media for something I
don't know about right
I'm just going to tell you this is the
claim in the trailer
that they have a cell phone I think a
cell phone or cell phone tracking right
and they have video to show that there
are these 2 000 humans who delivered a
large number of ballots to a large
number of the same boxes in exactly the
places where the numbers looked a little
sketchy
the other places that mattered
now
if this is true
it's like the story of the decade
it would be bigger than just about
anything that's ever been big
if it's not true
then it's Al Capone's safe well it was
interesting I'm glad to be watched so I
guess my the only thing I can say about
it at this point
is you use your judgment
but
somebody says it's an old story but I
don't believe that
I don't believe that anything with
evidence
I think it's the evidence that's the new
part I mean if it was speculation that
maybe that's old
but speculation doesn't mean much
yeah if it's an old rumor
that doesn't count it's the evidence
that makes the movie or doesn't we'll
find out all right so I'm not promoting
it or not promoting it I'm saying this
is a very big claim and if uh Dinesh
D'Souza does not does not back up this
claim uh
he'd have a lot to answer for so I think
given how much he has a stake
I I hope for his sake he's going to
deliver but uh
but watch and say
um I saw an interesting tweet by Mike
cernovich which is sort of a overusive
and adjective because everything that he
tweets is interesting so he sort of has
that gift that just everything's
interesting that he does
um but he tweeted about Trump having
actual luck you know uh cernovich was
saying they think luck is an actual
thing that Trump has it
and I just wanted to add to that that
luck seems to happen to people who
discover they can author the simulation
I feel as though there are some people
who just have the feeling that they can
make stuff happen
and there's something about that feeling
or that intention
I don't want to call it a belief
that seems to make the universe give you
what you want now it could be just a
subjective
you know selective memory kind of thing
but it does look like it right it just
it just has that feel
that some people are writing the
simulation
um
speaking of Trump's luck how lucky is it
that he followed that Biden followed
Trump
pretty lucky
let me give you uh here's why
so
um
this is a Rasmussen Rasmussen results
said ask the question that is Biden
Administration immigration policy better
or worse than Trump's now wouldn't you
say is it fair to say that Trump's
immigration policies
not only got him elected you know it was
probably the the main thing
but also the most controversial and the
the thing that everyone pointed to that
had some connection to every racist
accusation about it
so I think you'd say it's sort of the
biggest issue in the Trump era
and 52 percent of the respondents said
that Biden Administration is doing worse
at the very thing that they were trying
to fix
52 percent say he's doing worse
um how many people say that Biden is
doing better
at handling immigration
28 percent
28 percent
28 think the hordes of people coming
across the border
is a sign of good management of the
Border 28.
that well 28 is roughly a quarter
a quarter is roughly 25 25.
25 percent
exactly the number who get every Bowl
wrong
well here's my final comment about
Whoopi Goldberg which is really a
comment about us
so this will look like a comment about
Whoopi it's not
this is about
us you know we humans
here's what I saw I'm just going to
characterize the whole whoopee situation
I saw a person acting perfectly human
perfectly human
now that's not perfect because humans
are not perfect right
but there is something that I would call
a perfect human and it goes like this
you have flaws or you make mistakes
would you all agree that to air is human
making mistakes is a hundred percent
Universal it's a it's just a requirement
of being human
so a perfect human is one that makes a
mistake
and then
handles the mistake here's the important
part
handles the mistake in a good form so
here's Whoopi who made you know let's
say observers would say a mistake and
how she handled the references to the
Holocaust then what did she do she
listened to their concerns
she showed empathy for the concerns she
adjusted her opinion fairly quickly she
did a little research said she'd look
into it further do some more thinking
she apologized
recognized out loud and in public
recognized the damage or you know the
hurts it may have caused
and then after doing everything perfect
a perfect human
flawed yes Perfectly Flawed
you know if you believe that God created
us well then that's what he wanted it
was it was a perfect creation and if you
don't want that interpretation you just
say well
you can't get any better than that so
that's that's as perfect as a human can
be and then she handled it with
perfection literally a role model of how
to be a perfect human
I don't think I'm exaggerating at all
that was a role model of how to be a
perfect human and she got suspended
one comment on locals you're an idiot
well I guess that covers it
um I believe there's a weird thing
happening
in which uh meme logic is replacing real
logic
now I've told you before that
um
analogies have been substituted for
logic quite often
and when you see it now you recognize it
right that somebody's just using an
analogy because they don't have an
argument
and you say wait a minute like I get
that that has some similarities that
remind you of what we're talking about
but it's actually not what we're talking
about and there are enough differences
that your analogy would make me argue
some completely different situation so
get out of here with your analogies
but I think that a lot of people
actually don't have the mechanisms or
the resources to think logically in any
complicated situation
you know because all all human
capabilities unevenly distributed right
so there's a whole segment of the
population
that uses analogies to think
which is sub-optimal
but I think there's a new thing
happening which is people are using
memes
to think
so Susan Sarandon
actress Susan Sarandon she tweeted this
meme today showed a bunch of I guess
police officers at the funeral for the
Fallen officer
and
um
here's what the meme that she tweeted
said now this is what I call Meme logic
all right so this is not real logic
because the meme doesn't actually make
sense
and you'll you'll agree the meme doesn't
make sense
but she says so if all these cops
weren't needed for Crime that day
doesn't that mean they aren't needed any
day
now that's meme logic
you can just it's just that form
it's like oh if we don't have to do this
then why do we have to do this or if
this is true why is this true now meme
logic isn't real logic because of course
these were just people who either you
know got backfilled they probably picked
the time of the day when it's low crime
you know you add up to people who are on
vacation with the people who came in out
of town of course there was a perfectly
good explanation of why there probably
was plenty of people covering the crime
at the same time there were plenty of
people there and anybody with half a
brain would know that immediately
but this meme logic
sort of like an analogy logic
I just worry that people are going to or
already have
that 25 of the public just looks at a
meme and says well that's good enough
for me
you can follow that logic
all right
um
and if you think that's crazy keep in
mind that research shows that when
something Rhymes we think it's true
think about that
when something Rhymes we're more likely
to think it's true as in if the glove
doesn't fit you must equipped that's why
Johnny Cochran did it because the
science supports
the rhyme as being persuasive I think
memes are as persuasive as a rhyme
because they're both
they're both little ear worms
um
so yeah anyway probably the same
effectiveness
uh here's a question for you what do
covid and the Holocaust have in common
I will not say anything insensitive
about the Holocaust
what do covid and the Holocaust have in
common
two things number one
um kovid looks to be on target to
killing about six million people
that's actually Holocaust numbers
so we've act we've literally you know
not in any hyperbolic way but actually
literally
coven Holocaust are similar numbers
here's the second thing they have in
common
there is a large group of people who
don't believe either one of them
happened
and that will always be true
there will always be people who think
the call that the Holocaust didn't
happen
even though the official number is 6
million dead and there will always be
people who think that covet didn't
really happen
even though the official number is six
going to be dead
now I want to be real clear I'm not
saying anything about the Holocaust
I'm just saying it's a weird it's just
like a weird parallel
right no I'm not saying the Holocaust
let's not do any Holocaust denying I
don't need any trouble
all right uh I think this is true but it
might be a testing artifact so I need to
fact check on this it looks to me like
the number of cases of covid
um started plunging about a week ago
really steeply
at least that's what the numbers say is
that is that just a data problem
but the deaths are still high
and the the deaths are still high
if if in fact the cases have plunged the
deaths are still high because it takes
two or three weeks for the deaths to
clear right
so it takes the people who are sick and
are going to die it might take them a
little while to actually die
so in theory we're already past it
I think I mean we could be surprised by
some new variants or something but I
think that the drop in cases says that
nobody knew or at least there are not
enough new people getting it that in
three weeks we're going to see new
deaths based on what's happening today
I think we're at the endemic but let's
talk about the the people forcing some
of us to wear masks so the latest story
is that mayor Garcetti of La uh he got
he had got his picture taken with Magic
Johnson too which is really bad for your
for your political record apparently
don't get your picture taken with Magic
Johnson so first Newsom did it without a
mask and then mayor Garcetti did it and
uh but Garcetti made it worse
by saying that he was holding his breath
he was holding his breath now here's
what I love about it
there's something transparently uh
absurd about it
when when your political leader says he
was holding his breath and I think he
followed it up with if it'll make people
happy he'll stop cheating it with his
mask
is he not telling us directly that he
believes the masking is ridiculous
am I right
is he not telling us as directly as
anybody who's a politician can
that he thinks the whole thing is just
absurd
I think so
so while some people are sort of mocking
him for
saying such a ridiculous thing I feel as
if that ridiculous thing came with a
wink
am I over interpreting that maybe
reading too much I could be
but but I feel that even if it's a
subconscious wink it's a wink
that we're just we're in the end game we
we need to get rid of the Mask a couple
more updates there's an LA supervisor
Catherine Barger Barger
she's calling on officials to get rid of
the mass mandate partially because of
these leaders without masks
Oakdale California a number of students
in the district are refusing to wear
masks and high schoolers are they're all
being sent to a gym literally the kids
are in cages
they put the kids in a cage because if
the kids leave the school I think that
affects their budget and there's some
problem for the school itself
but if they lock them up in the gym and
say you can't leave
they're literally in jail for not being
masked
what do you call it if you're in a room
and they don't let you out
it's kind of jail isn't it
so basically Oakdale is jailing students
for not wearing masks meanwhile I had my
faith restored in our youth
because uh if you many of you have seen
it the viral video of a
Washougal High School in Washington
state where a very gifted young leader
among the students was organizing them
to
protest by gathering in mass in the
parking lot leaving their Mass there
entering the school and waiting to be
sent home and then politely being sent
home but here's what impressed me
I don't know what uh live streams or
podcasts that family watches
but let's just say his advice was
extremely compatible with what I've been
saying which is you are not
you are not treating the teachers as the
enemy because they're not it's not their
idea right it's the state so don't be
disrespectful to the teachers don't
don't be disrespectful to the Walmart
greeter don't be disrespectful for
anybody who was it wasn't their idea
so that's what he said as he was
organizing it and very eloquently and
told them the whole plan he said we go
in in Mass we'll be kicked down in Mass
that's bad for the school that's what
the protest is supposed to do make it
uncomfortable for the school without
creating any actual health problem or
any danger
very organized very respectful very
legal
very perfect my faith is restored
Faith restored
so good job there
uh but I think we've got to get kids out
of their face cages even even if they're
not physically locked in a room their
faces are in cages imagine if you will a
meme or a viral video in which number of
kids wearing their masks asked parents
to please help them get out of their
face cages
Mom Dad
will you please help us get out of our
face cages
viral video every kid makes one put its
on Tic Tac just talk to your mothers
just make the video to your mom your dad
to parents ask directly
ask directly to be released from your
face cages to live a normal
childhood
ask
you don't even have to demand just ask
because do you know how hard it is for
parents to
deny a child who's suffering
real hard
it's real hard
you you can make the system break faster
than an adult skin because you know what
when adults
complain do you know what people say
when adults complain
walk it off suck it up you're an adult
do you know what happens when a kid asks
a parent because they're in pain to stop
something
people are going to act they're gonna
act right away
yeah so kids you have the power Tick
Tock it up
um but apparently the teachers will be
fighting back there's this audio from an
assistant principal at ludon County
Elementary School that says that any
massless kids will be charged with
trespassing which holds a 12th month as
a felony there 12-month jail sentence
2500 fine potentially
um and let me let me just State this as
a little advice
to the assistant principal of the Lou
down
uh or eluded I don't know County
Elementary School
if you need lawyers
to keep kids in your school
you're doing something wrong
that's it that's a little advice
if any part of your strategy requires
lawyers
and you know lawyers will get involved
if anybody's getting charged with
trespassing if any part of your
schooling strategy involves lawyers
you're doing it wrong you're doing it
wrong
all right here's a little report from my
neck of the woods from uh Twitter user
Rick's place he reports he says
interesting I was in Northern California
Walmart five days ago and it was a
hundred percent masks so that was five
days ago he says today it was about 75
percent something changed I think it was
actually the the hashtag Feb one that
Scott Adams and Greg guffeld have been
pushing well I don't know if that's the
case
but I do think that people are sort of
over it at about the same time
I'm being I'm being told that the
pronunciation of that school is uh
Loudoun Louden
thank you
so uh if you have other reports of
places that are demasking at a high rate
send them because people are heard
people
what what it will take for masks to come
off is for masks to come off you need
some people to go first so that the
people who are you know less let's say
more risk averse that is safe enough for
them to go next
so you need some kind of a you people
need to hear that other people are doing
it or it's not going to happen
so here's a little hypothesis I'm
working on which is that and I guess you
could disagree with this now remember
this what comes next is a gross
generalization
so this is not meant to apply to you or
your family or anybody specific
but as I tweeted this morning I think
American culture used to be about
working hard and
buying a lot of stuff that you can
impress your neighbors
now I believe that was actually
intentional sorry if you just got this
weird itch today I think it was
intentional
um and if I understand my history right
that in the 50s the government wanted to
create a consumer
population people would want to buy
stuff because if people wanted to buy
stuff that would keep industry cooking
and you know the economy would go which
worked wonderfully so I think the
advertising industry learned how to
manipulate people into craving
craving whatever the neighbors had yeah
wow we gotta have a better car or a
better house all that stuff now so you
can think of that as sort of the
operating system
or the you know maybe the
yeah primary let's say theme of the
country
was working hard acquiring things and
it's part of the payoff is looking good
to the neighbors
I'm not saying that's good or bad I'm
just saying it was
right right so maybe a CIA thing but
um the things we can agree on is that
the government was behind it they
successfully brainwashed the public and
it probably made the country stronger
you know all kinds of negative effects
too but it probably made the United
States what it is that consumer
mentality but now I would argue that
that is falling away or partially being
replaced
that instead of hard work to buy stuff
which you could argue you know wasn't
exactly a high level goal has been
replaced by working hard to understand
which groups are the biggest victims
now again I'm not going to say what's a
good or ethical or moral thing to do I'm
just going to observe I'm just looking
at it like I'm looking like an engine
you know I'm not I'm not judging the
carburetor I'm just saying well
engine needs a carburetor right I'm not
not judging the
fuel injection or anything
so
how do you do as a country if you're
trying to have a competition to see who
is the biggest victim
versus the old way which again I'm not
saying was good or bad the old way where
you're competing to buy the most stuff
which pretty directly helped the economy
I don't think either of them are healthy
right it feels like both of them end
badly
but so we had one theme that at least it
was good for the economy but had you
know lots of downsides
especially if you weren't successful in
that economy
so what would be better
you know is there a new frame or theme
or could we reframe
how are at least American experiences is
expressed
and here's how I would do it I would say
we're a country that has a strategy that
works for everybody
but it's a different strategy so more of
a uh
find your own adventure situation
so we should be thinking of ourselves
instead of a nation of victims or a
nation of winners who are buying nice
cars
we should be a nation where you could be
anything
you could be the person who bought the
nice car or you could be the awesome
person who you know helps people and you
know never never drove a nice car but it
wasn't important to you why can't both
of those things be good and why can't we
say we're the country that gives you any
strategy you want
we'll give you a strategy for a lower
income life that's very meaningful we'll
give you a strategy for a high Income
Life that also could be meaningful or a
high Income Life That's just buying a
bunch of crap and enjoying it but why
can't we have a life where if everybody
doesn't have a strategy
you know a way to go from wherever they
are to wherever they want to be that
it's the strategy we fix
because I think we're almost there
strategy and what I mean is to use the
perfect example if you were a low-income
black kid in a bad neighborhood
is there a strategy
to make it in this world well only if
you can survive the school
meaning only if you can guess something
like a good enough education if you get
a good enough education which is
probably the thing we need to fix which
is why you would put all your effort
there because that that's blocking the
strategy of a whole segment of the
population
their best strategy is do well in school
or learn a trade which we also don't
provide in large enough amount so as if
you were talking about strategies it
would be more of a forward-looking
positive everybody understands that
everybody needs a strategy
but we don't agree that everybody needs
the same outcome right
so we're arguing over outcomes
when we could all be agreeing on
everybody's got a different way they can
succeed but everybody should have some
way
some way if you don't have any way then
Society maybe needs to help you get away
whether you use it or not that's up to
you still has to be up to you to use it
um
yes and also we need to reframe I think
the value of work
all right
um remember yesterday I think it was
yesterday I told you there's this new
study meta-analysis
that was showing that uh the lockdowns
didn't make any difference in terms of
covid more uh mortality and I told you
my first instinct was it looked like BS
and today I was looking at Andreas back
house just you know ripping it apart
so he pretty much disemboweled the study
as in terms of his credibility I I won't
give you his argument you can read it
yourself uh and and the only thing you
should take away
is that
I don't know if any of the studies or
the meta-analysis were valid
or I don't know
if the lockdowns worked or didn't work I
just know I haven't seen anything I
would trust that says they worked could
we agree on that
just in my case I guess you would have a
different answer but I haven't seen
anything I would trust
because at this point who trusts said
anything well I haven't seen anything I
would trust that would suggest the
workben that the lockdowns worked
somebody says Andre says wrong 80 of the
time
now that that sounds like a statistic
you're not going to be able to back up
all right uh Ian bremmer uh tweeted this
about this was from a Gallup poll so
here's how things have changed in two
years basically during the pandemic 2020
to 2022. so in the in the poll people
were rating I was satisfied they were
with these things
so in 2020
uh people were uh 84 percent of people
were overall satisfied with the quality
of life
which seems amazingly High I can't
believe we ever were at 84 but during
the Trump Administration I guess 84
percent were happy with the overall
quality now that's down to 69 percent
uh satisfaction with the system of
government it was at 43 percent
which is usually just it means whoever's
in power they like it for a while the
other side doesn't you know it's usually
a little of that now that starts at 30
giant drop uh satisfied with the economy
down from 68 to 33.
68 to 33. now that might have happened
anyway under any president because
inflation was going to kick in about now
um and then our role in the world 43
were satisfied now 37. now
how does anybody
who wanted to be Biden over Trump
how do you rationalize this
how in the world do you rationalize that
you got what you thought you wanted
I just don't know how you could do it I
mean you really have to try hard
because even if you were in the group
that is satisfied you'd have to notice
that the other people are not you'd have
to at least notice that the majority are
not and that is moving in the wrong
direction
well here's the other uh news that
somehow is connected to what I just was
talking about
but uh Biden announces they've killed
the Isis leader I guess in Syria they
got him
um and I always wonder
do we always have an Isis leader queued
up in case we need one to kill
I feel like we always know where one is
and if if the news cycle is going
against you you know you reach into your
bag of tricks of you know diversion
narratives it's like all right we need a
diversion narrative
um give me the list of Isis top three
people
uh uh MO
oh okay can you drone this guy uh by by
the end of the day we need a little more
a little more positive spin on things
and so uh sure enough
apparently we killed Abu Ibrahim qurashi
um and as you knew as you already knew
that was the head of Isis
so
is it my imagination
or is everything heading in the right
direction
except maybe inflation
am I right
it feels like everything just sort of
suddenly is moving in the right
direction except inflation
every everything else looks
fairly good I say accept inflation like
that couldn't take us down
yeah energy well I think energy if you
if you count the long run
yeah nuclear gas even those look like
they're going to move in the right
direction maybe not right now but they
look like they would
um would I describe America as an
oligarchy
no because in the oligarchy you imagine
a small group of people are in charge of
everything
America is more like competing
um interests
so there's they're sort of like you know
a set of usually there's at least one
billionaire involved there could be a
set of billionaires that really really
care about
one international issue
and another that can really really care
about something else and then there'd be
you know some cross-pollination of some
of the billionaires from one might also
care about this third thing I think it's
always that
I think it's always the there are big
influencers for every topic and they
just own the topic until somebody takes
it from them
a multi
-docracy yes
somebody says a staph infection from
head scab picking be careful
um
I don't know did you did you notice me
doing something on my head so I actually
do have a head scab
um because I had some
you know just pre-cancerous stuff that I
get burned off every Frozen off every
every few months
routine stuff
but boy does it hurt when it happens oh
my God it hurts
uh what's your solution for inflation
I don't have a solution for inflation
that might be one thing that's beyond
even my powers
of solving
um but I will tell you this
I never understood
um how far we could push the debt and
still be okay and I still don't
so given that we're also we're already
Way Beyond the point of what most of the
experts would have said would be
collapse
aren't we something like
I don't know what the number is but if
maybe somebody is more plugged into this
wouldn't you say we're something like
five times
the size of debt Beyond collapse
meaning that we never really knew what
would cause a collapse in the first
place or are we on the path to sort of
collapse and everybody was right all
along
now we're only about 1.25 times well I
think that would be comparing it to a
historical
high as which would which is good
comparison actually comparing it to
history would at least tell you that
we've done it before
and I think World War II was the biggest
uh debt problem right
oh here's a debt to GDP ratio is what
matters for collapse that's correct so
debt to GDP is what matters for collapse
it's always a ratio not the number
um so somebody says debt F4 times GDP
would equal collapse that sounds like
somebody knows that
um solution for hyperinflation
is an economic reset I don't know is it
30 trillion if interest rates rise yeah
so I guess we're all we're all guessing
now but I do wonder if there's a crypto
a crypto play here
I also wonder if crypto is our our way
to be free of the
the elites or is it just the another way
the elites will control us
it's sort of starting to look like it
crypto is just going to be another way
that the elites control us
because won't they be able to see all of
our transactions at some point
I I feel as if the current banking
system
gives them like at least a little bit of
blindness
you know they'd have to do a little bit
of work to find out about stuff
but
it isn't crypto going to be the opposite
of secure at some point
even if only for legal requirements I
suppose can't they just force it to be
transparent
or or not accepted or make it illegal if
it's not
yeah no so I understand the the concept
that it you know it's decentralized that
should keep the government out of your
business but I don't believe it
I don't believe it would work I believe
the government could get control of
anything
you just give it enough time
um you are less informed than you need
to be
I that's certainly true when it comes to
crypto I'm less informed than I need to
be but
I am going to say something that I don't
think depends on crypto
does it depend on crypto to say
that the government can probably
penetrate anything
because even if the technology is
designed so it can't
they can just put people in jail until
they they have anything they want can't
they
if if they have the control of you
physically
then they have the control of your
crypto wallet because it'll just put you
in jail until you give them their until
you give up your number am I wrong
if they can control your body they
control your wallet it doesn't matter if
it's crypto or something else
I'm not wrong am I
um
I'm saying FYI the U.S backs Isis in
Syria well I don't know I don't know the
details there but but it would certainly
suggest there's a reason why we know
where their leader was
a surprise
uh who knows I don't know who we're
backing against who
yeah so you know I worry that the crypto
thing is all an illusion
sorry
and by the way I do own crypto
I do own crypto so I don't want it to
collapse yeah and I own it because I
think that there's more chance it will
go up than down
but I don't think privacy is going to be
a feature I think it's just going to be
it's going to be convenience
but I don't think it'll be privacy
I'm afraid
or at least no more privacy than you
have now I think it'll be the same kind
of privacy
because think about how they can
um
control businesses so the way the
government would control you is not
directly
the government would say all right
Amazon
now that you're taking crypto they don't
I guess they don't take crypto but let's
say they did let's say Amazon tomorrow
says we're going to take crypto
the same day the government could say
this is just an example the government
could say Okay Amazon will put you in
jail
unless you require every time you take
crypto
that you know we have access to the
transaction
what's Amazon going to do
they're either not going to accept
crypto so there's a limit to where
usefulness of it or they're going to say
okay well you're going to have to agree
with it on your end and I'm going to
have to pass that along to the
government or else you don't get your
stuff
so I think the government can press and
you know companies that you need to live
your life and then the companies will
press you and then just pure convenience
will make you say well oh hell I'm not
going to die in this hell I just want my
t-shirts or whatever I'm buying
uh what about Hunter
I haven't heard much about him have we
um if someone makes a bad joke should I
laugh politely or should I be more
honest
uh I would say if it's somebody that
matters to you that has you know either
power or you want to date them maybe
laughing politely would be the better
play
uh I I'm generally in favor of being
polite
in all in all situations
did Hunter sell an nft is it is that
what I'm saying
uh best advice on marriage
past advice of marriage now that would
be a micro lesson wouldn't it
um Let me let me say all right so let me
give you the best advice so this would
be not based on my own experience all
right so don't read into anything that's
about my house this would be based on
other people's sort of like General
experience
the main reason that people get divorced
is money
right
I think that's still true the main
reason people get divorced is money
so number one you've got to be on the
same page on money number two you've got
to be on the same page on kids
and if you don't work that stuff out
before you get married well
don't expect it to work right just don't
expect it to work
so you've got to get the
the money in the kit thing worked
thirdly
you have to give up all of your social
media passwords
and live like you're one person
because I don't think I I think in
today's world social media is such a
pressure on uh on marriages
that
you might need to agree on that in
advance
in fact would you marry somebody who
said no to them
I know you all want to like ask me about
my situation but that's that's not the
that's not the topic
so I I guess I guess part of the the
reason I'm putting it this way is that
the way the way the world is organized
at the moment where everybody can earn
their own money
and everybody has access to everybody
else so you've got all that Temptation
and risk going on
that the only people who should get
married
are in a I would say a thin strip of
people
who meet those requirements
now it could be that you know there's
something special about the two of you
that you don't worry about the social
media part
but you got to get the kid thing and the
money thing right
that part you got to get right
Newsweek now disagrees with Scott and
says that masks don't work
um I I can always look at a comment and
know when the commenter has the wrong
information even when I don't even know
what the story is so I don't even know
what the Newsweek story is but I
guarantee you that you read it wrong
I'll bet you the story says the masks
that some masks don't work as well as
n95s
or
and it might be and or and or the story
says
that they're not going to help much
against Omicron
and omicron's you know sort of a new
game
so that would that wouldn't disagree
with anything I've ever said
right yeah Blue Point
um I I hope I'm I hope I'm doing a
better job holding to my commitment
to be post pandemic but there's still
some mop-ups things we need to do to get
our rights back so when I'm talking
about it I'm really going to be talking
about the mandates from now on
I'm going to focus on the mandates as
the only thing that seems to matter
in my opinion
yeah I saw a
H yeah so Denmark's
well let's just watch Denmark see what
happens if Denmark survives then
uh I saw Dana Perino uh tweet she
checked on Denmark this morning
and uh apparently Denmark has survived
the lifting of the sanctions they
survived
still there
go Denmark
all right Boo got her uh her tube out
did I tell you that my cat boo got her
feeding tube out and wow is she happy
she's so happy
and so am I she seems to be doing fine
all right
um
and that is all for now and I will talk
to you
tomorrow
