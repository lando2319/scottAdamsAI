good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a better time
and if you made the mistake of watching
anything else at this time well you're
probably regretting it already because
you can take this this experience up to
levels where nobody's ever seen it
before and all you need is that cover of
my girl glass up tanker chalices die in
the canteen Jazz a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine so
the day thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip when it
happens now go
ah that was a stream slip
strange but beautiful
graceful elegant
classy really
all right well we got a lot going on
here so I'd like to start with my
favorite story
which I will look for on Twitter to show
you if you haven't seen it already
there's some gentleman I'm not sure
where it was it might have been an
African country couldn't tell from the
background but there's a a clever
gentleman who rigged a bicycle
so that if you tried to steal the
bicycle and it was left unlocked in an
easy place to steal
the seat would collapse when he got on
it and the pole that normally holds the
seat would go right up your ass
so you would be shoving a metal pole up
your ass with the force of your own body
weight when you sat on it
now
if you don't think that's funny
well
you don't know me
because there's a compilation video of
all the people sitting on it
now now the funny part is watching them
none of none of them steal the bike they
all walk around like this
[Laughter]
all right the thing I love about it
the thing I love about it is that none
of them actually steal the bike
you know theoretically you could still
ride the bike or push it away and get
the seat fixed but everybody is
completely done with the bike after it
shoves a pole up their ass
I so want to get that bike or build my
own that's just the funniest thing ever
well Chicago is going to have flying
taxis
that's really going to happen so if you
go to the Chicago airport and you're
heading to the middle of the city uh in
maybe a year or so United will allow you
to take a uh a short hop flight
in a vertical takeoff plane so the plane
will just go straight up over and
straight down in the middle of the city
and apparently they've already purchased
the hardware and they've got the plan
and it's actually going to happen so
there will be flying taxis in a year
it's not flying cars I think it takes
you know six people or something but
that's pretty exciting so you miss all
of the uh all of the traffic
150 miles an hour can't wait
there's your flying cars kind of but
flying taxis
all right I saw an interesting uh
prediction from Naval ravacant and if
you don't know who Naval is the only
thing you need to know is if you predict
something pay attention right that
that's my whole commercial if he says
something you should look at it you
should pay attention to that
but anyway uh here's his prediction on
Twitter he said bet micro Microsoft
ships a phone built around AI by the end
of the year
and then he says look out Apple and
Google
so what do you think so Microsoft
has some ownership of this big chat GPT
open AI whatever it's called and so they
they're being
um search engine already uses it
and
Naval is thinking that they might build
it into a phone
now how long have I been telling you
probably
five years or more I've been saying the
the ultimate obvious place that the
phone interface will go is no apps no
apps you just start doing what you want
to do
the perfect interface for a phone would
be a blank screen
just a blank screen
and if you say to it hey uh make a
spreadsheet and add up these numbers
then it just creates a spreadsheet right
in front of you or if you say send a
message
it just creates the app and sends the
message and then deletes the app or it
could save it I suppose but you'll never
have to worry about apps you just tell
it what to do and it goes and figures
out and do it I think that's what's
going to happen
I think your phone is just going to be a
blank screen and you talk to it
alternately here's how I would have
designed the phone already
I would have designed this so that you
pick it up and start doing the thing you
want to do
just start doing it if you want to
search for something on Facebook
you just type in blah blah and then uh
you just type in the yeah the search
term
and then as you type it in the AI says
well I don't know what this is about he
could be writing an email
could be sending a message or could be a
search term
so it would pop up several choices
and as soon as you typed it in you'd say
uh
you know the best place to eat in San
Francisco you type it in
and among the choices are a Google
search a Bing search or an email but you
know it's a search so you just hit Boop
so interfaces are backwards you should
never have to deal with the app before
you do the activity you wanted the app
for you should start the activity and
then AI should figure out what apps or
app would make sense with what you're
doing so it should look at your context
and then figure out the app for you
imagine how much less thinking that
would be
do you know how much time why type well
you would type because people are
listening
so you can't always speak out loud to
your phone
um
that's the way it's going right there's
no way it's there's no way that 10 years
from now you're going to be selecting an
app and then telling you what to do
there's no way that that could could
last
all right
um
Twitter is fun again
so I guess uh uh musk is giving some
stock grants to employees which value
the company at about half of what he
bought it for so he bought it for 44
billion
he's valuing it at least in terms of
valuing the stock options at 20 billion
but He suggests that in
10 years or so it could be worth 250
billion and that there's a difficult but
very doable path to 250 billion
valuation what do you think
if it gets to 250 billion and he's the
richest person times three I think
I think it's possible
yeah I think it's possible because to do
that he would have to fold in different
functions like payments
you know have the better advertising
you know situation have payments in
there yeah I think that's all going to
happen do you think there'll be a
Twitter phone
could be
yeah it could be you know it's it's also
easy to imagine that you would get uh
Twitter Plus
Skylink
somehow there'd be some kind of combined
deal or something you can imagine that
happening anyway I do think that there
are paths to 250 billion evaluation
um but the funniest thing about Twitter
is that they close down their press
contact so it used to be if you emailed
press at twitter.com you could ask a
question if you were the Press
and and now uh if you if you email you
get an automatic automatic response from
press twitter.com of a poop emoji
that's all you got it just gives you an
automatic poop emoji
you tell me that that could be more
perfect no no
that is the perfect interface
well Trump is saying out loud that he
thinks that uh Bragg has already dropped
the the Stormy Daniels case he told
reporters on his plane what do you think
do you think the charges are already
dropped I guess the grand jury's meeting
again today
I don't know if it's already dropped but
I don't see how it could go forward
uh Alan dershowitz has gone so far as to
say that uh the case is so weak
and the main the main guy who would
probably testify would be Michael Cohen
and now that Michael Cohen's own lawyer
produced a document that would show that
Cohen is a liar either is a liar or was
a liar but it's going to end up looking
the same because if he's a liar and you
put him on the screen
and you think he's going to say the
opposite of what he said in writing he
believed
you could get disbarred because you
could get disbarred for knowingly put a
liar on the on the stand
if it's his his witness and he knows
he's a liar and he needs that lie to
make his case and he puts him on the
stand he could be disbarred
now I think you'd have to prove he knows
it's a lie so I don't think it could
really happen but uh dershowitz is
putting under pressure
like well you know there's a possibility
that this could end with Bragg being the
one who loses his job instead of trump
I like that he put it out there I don't
think it's likely but I like that it's
out there so I'm going to predict that
the charges will not go forward
what's your prediction
that one way or another the charges will
not proceed
yeah and I I think that if it were still
politically good
but uh legally sketchy it would go
through
but now it's obvious that it's a
political disaster as well as a legal
disaster so legally it was always weak
but politically maybe you could you know
get some points but now it's obvious
that this this even the threat of it
made Trump more popular
even the threat of it
so I tried to play a video on CNN
the the tease of it was that Jon Stewart
said something along the lines in a
recent interview
that this is why Trump got elected
now wouldn't you want to know what that
video said
what did Jon Stewart say
about
Trump this is why he got elected I mean
it feels like this it feels like the the
the brag situation the Elven Bragg
situation but have you noticed that the
the more you want to watch a video the
less likely it will ever play
you can click on that all
day long and it won't play and this the
same thing on Fox News
Fox News will say sexy picture of
somebody you actually want to look at
you know sexy bikini picture and I'll be
like
well I'm here anyway
we've got a little extra time
I think I'll just maybe click on that
sexy bikini picture and see what all the
news is about because I'm not the kind
who just looks at the headlines I like
to do my own research that's why I like
to click on the stories and get the
pictures and so I'll be like oh well
okay if this is the sexiest picture ever
from this person I think I got to see it
click or
nothing nothing
you you want a guaranteed video that
won't play
put a headline on CNN that says
Trump agrees he should not be president
and then whatever that video is it'll
never play it will never play
because it's too interesting
so somehow there's some kind of
technology that makes anything
interesting
unplayable at the same time and it's a
direct correlation if it's some boring
ass story of a general said oh I'm a
general and uh blah blah Ukraine oh
that'll play yeah that'll play just fine
first try
or how about the pope comes out against
War oh that'll play
that'll play
but if they say here's a video of uh
Nancy Pelosi having
having I don't know sex with uh
Adam Chef
caught on video that won't play now you
could click on that all day long that
will not play nope
so that's how you know
uh well I don't know why you know from
that it's just a fact
all right uh I saw your opinion piece on
why the school choice
movement is working well at the moment
when for so long it didn't get much
traction
and a lot of it is being credited to
Corey D'Angelo and his his strategy
now some of it of course was the
pandemic right people got to see Zoom
school and see how horrible it was and
got more interested in their kids
education and all that so some of it's
sad some of it's the alleged CRT in
classrooms some of it's the the teaching
young kids
too much about sex too early say people
um so there's lots of reasons why people
would be more interested in
homeschooling but
the current thinking is that
homeschooling is being driven on values
as opposed to education
do you buy that that feels right I don't
have data to support that but it feels
like people are saying okay I was okay
when I didn't know if my kid was
learning to read and write
but you know it seemed like everybody
was in the same boat so you know you
sort of went along what are you going to
do anyway
but as soon as you find out your kids
are being taught that they're either
victims or oppressed
or that their gender is sort of up to
them then the parents end up getting
really involved
so I I think when you say what what will
you teach my kids
people go well you know I guess I could
put up with some imperfection
but when you say what will I turn my
kids into
that's a whole different game
because the you know that's not about
math that's actually turning them into
the kind of people
that is somebody's idea of a good
citizen but maybe not the parents idea
of a good citizen
so you can see why this is getting
energy right now it's the the social
part of it so if you're going to argue
it with anybody I'll go with the social
argument seem stronger than the they can
get better grades if they do this
all right
um
so I watched a clip on from NBC News
where Chuck Dodd was talking to Senator
Warren about tick tock
and
Senator Warren talked about the Privacy
issue and never mentioned the big
problem which is persuasion which is the
Chinese
Communist Party can essentially push one
button to make anything viral and that's
not even
um hyperbole
there is actually literally a button
called heat it's actually labeled the
heat button where they can make anything
viral
so that's a gigantic risk because I
don't know 150 million Americans use it
and they can make anything a fact
because our our minds are programmed by
what we see and then how often is
repeated that's it that's your whole
operating system for your brain so they
have control over what you see on Tick
Tock and how often do you see it that's
complete control of your brain that's
all it takes now I'm talking on average
I don't mean every single person will be
immediately programmed by some memes I
mean that on average you can move the
average reliably by how much you show
them of what reliably and you can see
that in every poll
if you look at the poll you know the
Democrats always go one way the
Republicans always go the other way even
on issues that are not political
that's how you know that you're being
programmed
yeah if you were not being programmed by
some third party then when a topic comes
up as no political connection whatsoever
the opinions would be sort of mixed all
over the place but they're not
every topic just becomes political which
is proof that you're being programmed
so Tick Tock has that power
and Elizabeth Warren never even mentions
that risk she only talks about data
privacy and
uh Chuck Dodd doesn't mention it either
so it's a story about the risk of tick
tock without mentioning the big risk of
tick tock
now how in the world is that an accident
how is that an accident it couldn't
possibly be an accident at this point at
this point there's no way you could say
that's an accident these have to be two
entities that are in the bag for China
this looks like Pro CCP propaganda
now uh I told you yesterday that AOC
also came out in favor of not Banning
tick tock
and her answer looked so obviously
bought off
that people just said well she must be
accepting money
because there's no way you could have
that opinion unless somebody just paid
you to have it because it's dumb
and now we find out
that Fox News digital
uh reported that by dance tick tocks
Chinese parent company funneled
six-figure contributions to non-profits
aligned with the Congressional Black and
Hispanic caucuses huh didn't we just see
a member of the
uh of the black caucus saying we
shouldn't ban Tick Tock I think I just
saw that recently or somebody who was
aligned with them
um and so they gave 150 000 to these two
at the black caucus and the
Congressional Hispanic caucus Foundation
huh I wonder if AOC has any connection
to the uh Hispanic caucus Institute oh
yeah she's a member
she's a member
any other questions
that there's your answer
there's your answer China just bought
her
uh not only did China buy her but we
have the receipt they left the receipt
this is not even in question
you know usually it's sort of
speculative like I don't know how did
Elizabeth Warren you know benefit in any
way I don't know maybe she just likes
these two caucuses too or wants their
support or something
but there it is uh play this day now the
beauty of the tick tock story is that
there is only one right answer
and the right answer is to ban it
and there is no argument among people
who are willing to describe the the risk
so let me say that again because it's
important
there's nobody who can describe the risk
of tick tock who thinks it should be
legal in America everybody who can say
there are two risks one is data security
and the other one is persuasion anybody
who can say those two things out loud
also says ban it anybody who doesn't say
it's a persuasion risk mostly they're in
favor of keeping it but they know they
know there's another risk and that means
you can tell for sure and this has never
been true before but you can tell for
sure who's been bought off by China
now I say bought off I don't mean
directly it could be you know funding
for a caucus something like that but
it's very clear that anybody who's still
in favor of keeping tick tock
are just bought off
I've never seen one this clear before
have you
usually there's some argument on both
sides but what makes this an interesting
one is there isn't there is no argument
on both sides there is one argument a
hundred percent of people are on the
same side if they can State the argument
out loud
if they care state it out loud it's
intentional because they know the
argument at this point
it's amazing that any of these people
keep their jobs
well here's an interesting update on the
reparations situation in California now
there are two reparation stories in
California one is what San Francisco
came up with which is you know super
crazy time 5 million per descendants of
black slaves and one dollar houses you
could buy and 98 000 beer but there's a
a lesser but still crazy one for the
state itself
and the news is that Governor Newsom has
been quiet and not weighed in on the
recommendations
now I started by telling you that he was
being brilliant
because by telling the Committees to go
work out a recommendation I said to
myself oh that's brilliant they'll come
back with something that's so stupid
that he can easily ignore it without
being the one who turned it down
and I thought that's pretty pretty good
here's what I got totally wrong
if you like it when I admit I'm wrong oh
my God was I wrong
here's why
apparently there's no level of stupidity
that Californians will recognize as
stupid
I thought I thought it would be so far
over the line of reasonable that we
would just laugh at it and ignore it and
then that would be the end of it
but apparently there are enough people
in the state
I'm guessing especially the black
citizens of California
who are treating this seriously
they're actually acting like it's a real
thing
which puts Gavin Newsom in a bad spot
because if he were to approve this
that's the end of his political life
would you agree
that would be absolutely the end of his
political life
does anybody disagree with that
there's no way he could be a national a
national politician and that looks like
what he wants yeah so he's in a tough
shot tough place he can't say yes and he
can't say no whichever he says will end
him politically and he put himself in
that position so I'm going to take back
how clever it was
I vastly underestimated the gullibility
of Californians
I mean honestly I should have seen it
coming
can you spend a minute just insulting me
because I have it coming I think this
would be good for all of us could you
tell me how stupid I was
just let it out just just put it all out
there free pass nobody gets blocked
I deserve it keep it common
idiot yes idiot keep it coming
bring it bring it yeah okay
all right thank you thank you good job
and those who use all caps for their
insults extra credit
extra credit yeah totally moronic
did not see how gullible and stupid my
state is
but I'm going to put it in a larger
Trend okay you can stop insulting me now
I already had your phone I wrap it up
this would be a good time to wrap that
up wrap it up wrap it up
let's get back at another Trail
um here's a related story
or is it
or is it
is this related to that story you beat
the decision you decide okay uh ESPN is
uh they did a special video package to
celebrate women's history month and they
did it by honoring trans women Leah
Thomas
so for Black History Month ESPN is a
focusing on trans athlete Leah Thomas
now what does that have to do with the
California reparations
story
do you see anything that they have in
common
do you see it yet
Ridiculousness is close
it looks like the white people in
California have decided to embrace and
amplify to add to wokism
not just California but wherever ESPN is
out of it looks like there is a secret
plan by white men
mostly men to pretend to be so on board
with wokeness that they're going to
break the system
because there's no way that
there's no way women are going to let
ESPN get away with
with uh
celebrating
Leah Thomas a trans Athlete on women's
History Month
there's no way women are going to let
anybody get away with that
right so to me it looks like this is
like forced shark jumping you know when
they talk about poorly written TV shows
they say oh it jumped the shark it's a
reference to the old Happy Days TV show
and
it looks like white men are are pushing
the shark
they're like pushing you over the shark
it's like well if this is where you want
to go let's go there as fast as possible
let's get there right away
let's take that slippery slope right to
the bottom
so let's uh let's find out what those
reparations are
because those are totally practical
yeah that'll work everything will be
fine it's all fine five million dollars
per person who would complain what
problems could you possibly have
and how about women's History Month oh
well
you know as Ricky Gervais says those old
classic old style women with vaginas and
wombs and
no that's old school we like the new
women we like the new women with penises
or had penises yeah we like that kind of
women
so
um I believe that the next thing you're
going to see
is a movement uh by white men
to punish white men and white women
more severely
maybe maybe public whippings
because I think we've got to push this
thing do we figure out what is too far
because too far I thought I thought we'd
already reached too far but we have not
we got to keep going
keep keep making it more ridiculous
all right we'll get back to that
um here's why I think chat GPT and AI
will be illegal
here's why
um
so I asked uh
AI about uh
president Trump and whether one of the
sample questions on the chat GPT thing
was did Trump incite January 6 violence
that's a pretty big question isn't it
did Trump incite the violence
what do you think A.I said
well AI didn't want to you know commit
to that interpretation so that's good
but it described what Trump said and
said that some people interpreted it as
calling for violence guess what they
left out of his quotes
what part of his quotes from the speech
just before the January 6 bad stuff
happened what part of his speech do you
think they left out
they did quote his speech but they left
that apart
it's the part about uh protests
peacefully
they left out peacefully and
patriotically make your voices heard
today
AI left that out
why do you think they left that out
do you think it was programmed to leave
it out
well here's what I think
I don't think it's directly programmed
to do that
my understanding is it's a word
prediction
um system so in other words it simply
looks at how everybody has ever talked
ever
and then tries to talk the way most
people talk
and if the thing you trained on mostly
said that Trump was not in it for a
peaceful situation
that's what people said
if most of the people who talked about
January 6 completed a sentence with
January 6 Trump incited violence if
there's more of that than January 6
Trump called for peaceful protest it's
just it's just going to go with the
majority
that's my understanding I mean if that's
wrong somebody needs to correct me but
my understanding is you're just looking
for word patterns it's not thinking it's
just looking for word patterns this word
usually comes after that word
I was using some autofill program I
forget what it was
some app and I started a sentence and it
started suggesting the next word
and and I thought oh that is the next
word so I had it and then from the first
two words I I'd read written it
suggested three words that are most
likely the next word after those two
and one of them was correct
I wrote the whole sentence
from the first word
without ever typing another word
from the first sentence it gave me
choices and then narrowed down what I
was going to say until by the end it was
sort of only one choice for the last
word
yeah
that'll spin your brain around a little
bit
all right here's here's what I've been
saying about AI that is that will become
more and more true
the the longer we learn about it it goes
like this
we are not learning how to make machines
intelligent
that's what you thought we were doing we
are not teaching machines to be
intelligent here's what we're doing
we're proving we never were
AI can only prove that humans were never
intelligent and only imagined that they
were
that's what this proved the way humans
think is also word pattern
repetition
the way you can see it yourself if you
go on Twitter
you know how a person is going to end a
sentence because of the way they started
don't you you can tell oh it's one of
those one of those people whoever those
people is you could be on either side
and still say the same thing oh it's one
of those people
you know the left would say it's all one
of those Maga people I know what they're
going to say and maggot people would say
oh it's a leftist progressive I know
what they're going to say
and they're right they're both right
because both sides are just imagining
their thinking
but they're not when I tell you that the
news assigns you your opinions
and you you reject that and say well not
me but it probably does assign those
opinions to the other people probably
does but not me I use my reason
no your opinion is based on the pattern
of what you saw the most and if you
watched Fox News and you know right
leaving media the most
then when you complete a sentence you're
going to complete it the way they did
and you will believe that you thought
you'll believe that reason happened in
your brain but you'll just be doing
pattern recognition exactly like the AI
is what what is the most likely end of
the following sentence okay I watch Fox
News all day the end of the sentence is
uh Trump was framed framed okay now I go
over to watch CNN all day and I'd watch
CNN and MSNBC and nothing else all day
finish the sentence Trump is
guilty of multiple crimes
and that's it
that is what you think is thinking
I know you don't believe it
uh yesterday I told you about a study
that we've known for decades that the
critical thinking part of your brain
doesn't engage until half a second after
you decide
did you know that
the critical thinking part of your brain
doesn't even come online it doesn't even
activate until after you've decided and
we've known that for decades what does
that tell you it means that the decision
is based on this irrational pattern
recognition thing just like AI
right but then we have another process
where we rationalize it after the fact
the rationalizing is why the things we
say don't seem to make sense the
cognitive dissonance
every now and then the things we say do
make sense
but it's a coincidence
it's a coincidence and and by
coincidence if the thing you say makes
sense then you don't get cognitive
distance
because it's all consistent you only get
cognitive distance when your pattern
recognition and your your word fill in
thinking comes up with something that
the rest of your brain says Ah that
seems inconsistent but you have to go
with it anyway so you paper it over with
cognitive dissonance where you you
literally hallucinate that the things
that don't make sense make sense
so
you don't know this yet
but this is the biggest risk of AI the
biggest risk of AI is not what it does
the biggest risk of AI is what you
realize about yourself
or people realize realize it's gonna
it's gonna get rid of religion
it's going to get rid of political
preference you will start to recognize
them as programmed effects in your brain
you will recognize that your opinions
are not real
and that's going to take some adjustment
once you realize your opinions are not
real they're not even coming from you
they're just pattern recognition and
that's that comes from the outside
once you realize that everything's
different now it won't it won't kill you
because I've been on that
you know I've been on that menu since
I was probably 23.
probably age 23 I first realized that
your brain is not a logical engine when
I learned hypnosis that's the first
thing you learned first thing you learn
in hypnosis is that people are not
logical engines
if they were logical you couldn't
hypnotize them
did you know that
hypnosis wouldn't work if people had
logical brains the way you think they do
it works because what I make you focus
on and what I repeat
becomes your operating system it's just
that simple
all right
um
here's a reframe that's going to change
everything
back in
see when was it
1982 I think there was a study um
oh no it was long ago
1964. it was a study in which teachers
were randomly
there was a group that were randomly
selected in a classroom
and the teachers were told that they
were the Smart Ones
and so the teachers treated one group
like they were gifted
and then treated everybody else the same
what do you think happened
you already know the group that thought
it was gifted because their teacher
acted like that
their their performance went way up
now I was looking for whether that study
had been repeated and I didn't find it
but it is accepted
it is accepted because I see it a lot uh
but I'd love to know if that's been
debunked I don't think it's been
debunked I believe there's plenty of
evidence to suggest that what that how
you expect to succeed
is how it'll turn out
now you could say that that's a a
Winner's mindset wouldn't you if you
expect to do well do you do better
everybody knows that
everybody knows that if you expect to do
well
you're probably going to do better than
if you expect and not do well right now
is there anybody who doubts the premise
before I go on I need you all to buy
into the premise that what you expect to
accomplish is really gonna
make a difference right
look at Elon Musk
he expected that he could build a rocket
ship to Mars
other people expected that they couldn't
so the only one who expected he could do
it did it right this is very consistent
I expected
um
I know this is weird
and I I know it doesn't make me sound
good when I say it
but before I became a cartoonist I was
reading a newspaper looking at the
comics and I said to myself
I feel like I could do this on the first
try
and then I did
I actually expected that with no
experience whatsoever I could become a
famous cartoonist and then I did
now were my expectations unnecessary of
course
that my odds of succeeding in this field
were like one in ten thousand or maybe
one in a hundred thousand it was just
crazy
but I expected it would work
so I did it and then it worked
coincidence I don't know but I can tell
you that in my life when I expect
something to work
I expect it to work
even if it's irrational
still expect it to work
you know some of it is just pure
optimism it's not based on fact but when
I expect something to work damn it I
expect it to work
um when I learned to play drums I
expected it to work
and so a year and a half two years of
trying with no no progress at all
imagine doing something for a year and a
half and you couldn't even make it sound
like a Beat
I mean nothing even remotely like music
didn't stop me for a minute did not slow
me down you know why
as I expected to succeed
now eventually once I got limb
Independence you know everything came
easily so now I could probably play just
about anything you could play on drums I
would just have to practice that
specific stuff
I'm also playing the guitar
here's the problem
I don't expect I can do it
I don't
I'm playing it as if
I'm not believing my own opinion so I'm
still taking lessons and I'm going to
grind away for I'll probably grind away
for a year or so no matter what just to
find out but
I don't expect it
and that's a problem don't you think if
I expected it do you think I'd try
harder
I think I would
I think I would yeah so expectations
make your performance different
everybody's on board with that right I
want to make sure there's nobody who
disagrees with that statement
okay I think I think I've got full
agreement
all right now let's talk about uh
critical race Theory
and what children are taught in school
are the white children taught that they
can't succeed
nope
are the Asian kids taught that they
can't succeed
nope
are the indian-american kids thought
they can't succeed
nope
nope are the Hispanic children thought
they can't succeed well they've often if
they're immigrants they've got a you
know language issue and stuff so those
are real
but otherwise no they think they can do
whatever they want if you're a black
American kid do you expect to succeed or
do you expect a systemic racism will
prevent you from success
while you're being taught
the systemic racism is a barrier that
you have that other people don't have
what would be the predictable outcome of
telling black kids they they have more
obstacles to success than white kids
what would you predict lower test scores
right
is that the most predictable thing is
lower test scores
and sure enough there are lower test
scores
now
isn't the purpose of CRT to improve the
lives of uh black kids if it's in school
now of course there's the argument
whether they teach CRT or they just talk
about the same elements of it in
different ways which is I'm not going to
say that's different it's all the same
right so here you have something that is
scientifically
a hundred percent of people would agree
is bad for black kids
would you agree
do you think that there's any
psychologist any black
white asian do you think there's any
trained psychologist who would say it's
good for black kids to learn that they
have an extra extra thing preventing
them from success
I don't believe anybody who has a degree
or any credentials in Psychology would
be in favor of teaching some kids that
they're not going to succeed
no they don't say it that way they don't
say you're not going to succeed but
that's sort of the message
you know you're you're in a class of
people who have this special problem
you'll always have this problem no
matter what you do you'll run into this
problem
if you told me that every day I don't
know that I would try so hard I would
just figure out if something wasn't
working after a few years of plugging
along I'd say well
they were right the systemic racism is
keeping me from success but it might
have been that third year of plugging
that you needed
I I don't see any scenario in which CRT
is not
super harmful to Black Americans
what do you say
anybody disagree
is there any counter to that at all
I don't see any yeah
and and yet we're okay with that we're
okay with it I think the way to make
these CRT stuff disappear is that you
should call it what it is it's a way to
suppress black progress
CRT it wasn't designed that way it's
nobody's intention but it's clearly
going to do it clearly and
and even those the the black students
who succeed anyway
are they better off
do you think a uh a black successful
person is better off knowing that the
people who are looking at their success
are thinking it was probably
some kind of favoritism
it's not really good for people who are
actually successful I would I would be
really pissed
imagine how much I would hate it
if you know I had a successful career
and people would just look at me and say
yeah because you erase you got a little
boost there didn't you got a little
extra
I wouldn't like it at all
right
so that's the way to uh I think fix all
this now let me get a little more
controversial by quoting
I'm following an account on Twitter by
Tyrone Williams
his is a Twitter thing is immune hack
all is one word immune hack
now he doesn't have that many followers
a few thousand six thousand followers
something like that
um but he's he's pushing a message
that the difference in Black Performance
compared to other races in America needs
to be looked at
um more deeply
and I think his complaint is that if you
look at just poverty and you look at
just any IQ you might be missing the
real reasons for the difference
so Tyrone this is not me right if I
tweeted this I'd be double canceled but
Tyrone is trying to use what I'll call
some tough love
so my take is that Tyrone is really
trying to help and he's putting himself
out there at Great risk
because he probably thinks I think and
this is my just my impression of it I'm
not a mind reader but it looks like he's
just trying to help and he's trying to
help the black community in particular
with some tough love and tough honesty
but he's also making very
um useful
very useful additions to the
conversation for example
he he said this is his tweet Tyrone
Williams he says blacks are less likely
to one optimize their prenatal diet
exercise and sleep now I don't know if
that's true
but he seems to have looked into it
because he's kind of data driven
but he says that optimize their prenatal
diet to exercise and sleep less likely
to breastfeed less likely to read to the
kids less likely to ensure their kids
attend school stay under trouble in our
provision in math and reading and uh
less likely to do well on tests
and then he says but they expect equal
representation at top universities
so that's the tough love part so the
useful part is
and I would really like to know about
this
haven't we determined that breastfeeding
improves your intelligence
am I wrong that that's scientifically
demonstrated
we know that right yeah
and if it's true that there's a
difference well there's a there's a very
specific lever
that you could go after you know there
might be an education thing might be a
practical thing too there may be some
practical reason that some people can do
it and some can't
so
that's really useful
to be that's useful that's a specific
thing you could Target and you could say
let's do better on this
uh reading to your kids something you
could Target
optimizing prenatal diet well I would
think that this is a problem for
everybody who is low income
uh I don't know if there's any racial
difference in exercise and sleep
I don't know that but if there is
it's probably something you could find
out if there is a difference those
things would in fact have impact an IQ
we know that proper exercise helps your
IQ we know that diet helps you like you
don't we
is there any doubt that these three
things would help your IQ breastfeeding
better prenatal diet
and more focus on exercise and sleep
and that's pretty much guaranteed stuff
right
so this is why Tyrone's so useful he's
going for Solutions not politics
um and then you know ensuring your kids
stay in school and do well in tests and
stuff like that is pretty basic stuff
so
I would say we have some several
very promising and also somebody
mentioned lead and paint might be
another factor that is
disproportionately affecting black
Americans so there might be some
environmental
nutritional
um mindset things
and CRT and the you know the the message
that white people are victimizing you
and holding you down is almost certainly
reducing test scores and success
now if you wanted to be useful
these are things you could really make a
difference on like you could actually
move the needle on all of those things
and then find out
find out what's what
it does it close the gap does it not
close the gap I'd like to know
all right
um
yeah
the growth mindset tempers the effects
of poverty on academic achievement
all right so here's something from
I forget where I saw it but basically
it's it's saying that your mindset of
whether you you can succeed is one of
the biggest important things for success
now where do people get a mindset
where do you get your mindset from
where do you think that comes from
do you think you're born with it
I've seen a lot of studies that say uh
having a single father
gets you a good result by having a
single mother doesn't have you seen that
I don't know if it was limited to black
population but it might have been but
the study showed that if you only had
one parent
and it was a mother you were you'd have
some issues
but if the one parent is a father
that the kid would perform as well as
anybody who had two parents
I'm a little skeptical about that
because I think there's a selection bias
in that
the selection bias being
that if the dad is capable of and wants
to be a dad
that probably sorts people into the you
know the better category automatically
so I'm not sure
I'm not sure you're seeing a father
effect as much as a filtering effect of
who decides to be the father who decides
to be a single father in the first place
I think that's a filtering effect
um
right
okay
mother's matter father's matter yeah but
I think mindset comes from your peers
it comes from your parents
and
but where does success mindset come from
specifically
I wonder if that does come from Dad
now in my case it came from my mother
so I I can't speak to any other
situation but in my case my mother was
the one who you know said you're going
to college from the time I was a fetus
told me I'd be successful from the time
I could understand language always did
and you know
um when I was a teenager I was already
consuming self-help books if I ever told
you that
by the time I was a teenager and
certainly about my early 20s I was
consuming everything I could about how
somebody got famous or how they got
successful
I would read every story about somebody
who started with nothing and made it
every story I'd read every book that
said here's the secret to success I just
absorbed it all the time now where did
that come from
where did I get that habit
because all I remember is thinking oh
wait a minute there might be a formula
for success
are you telling me if I just learned the
formula that I would be successful you
know assuming I have unfunctional person
and so I I came to believe that if I
learned the formula that I could be
successful
so I spent years and years trying to
figure out the formula you know putting
it together and that's where I came up
with the talent the talent stack idea of
combining useful talents is by studying
other people's you know ways looking for
patterns and it's where I came up with
this system is more important than a
goal
that you have to be doing something
every day to improve your odds in
general not just working toward this one
goal in a straight line way
um
maybe you thought of something without
being assigned to you I don't think so I
think it came from my mother
because my mother was always the go to
school and you know it's all within your
power to have whatever you want I mean
my mother would say the old 50s and 60s
thing you can be whatever you want
so my mother was always
if you do the if you put in the work
and you learn how to do the work right
you know college or anything else so if
you figure out how to do it right and
you put in the work you can do anything
you want
that's exactly how my life turned out
now I don't think that works for
everybody
so I'm biased by my own experience but
how in the world did that not help me
compared to let's say a parent who said
you know
uh nobody succeeded in this family
because all that discrimination or
something
I never heard that story I never heard
that I couldn't succeed I only heard
that I could I never heard anything else
that's got to make a difference don't
you think it's got to make a difference
all right let me uh check with you
how many consider yourself successful
and had parents who had a positive
mindset I'm looking for the double you
consider your life successful however
you define it doesn't have to be
Financial
yeses and yeses
yes and yes yes and yes double yes and
yes no and no okay that's interesting
so the one
I'll bet there aren't too many people
whose parents told them they could do
anything they wanted
and then they consider themselves a
failure at middle age I bet it's rare
yeah yeah I mean you could you can see
the effect of mindset it's it's
everything
all right
so let me remind you give you a little
backup in context
do you remember I got in a little
trouble for saying something with a a
racial overtones
a few weeks ago anybody remember that
there were headlines about it
and
when it happened I realized that
something that wasn't obvious had
happened at the same time
which is I can talk about the topic of
race productively
without worrying about getting canceled
down
and I'm like the only person who can do
it
I'm the only one
I'm the only one who could have an
honest conversation about race
so people if you want to have an honest
conversation
I'm the one
and I'm fairly well informed
so I think I have something I could add
even if the only thing I added was
honesty
because
you know how many teachers
let me put it this way don't you think
they're professional teachers are fully
aware
that telling some group they're victims
suppresses their performance
now if I know it you don't think
teachers know it I mean I'll ask I'll
ask my sister she was she was a teacher
for years she's retired but if I asked
my sister who's probably listening right
now uh well text me all right sister I
won't say your name just so people don't
get all over you but sister of mine text
me right now and tell me
um tell me if you're not fully aware
that people will rise to their
expectations
yeah
her last name is not Adams so you can't
find her
um
I'll bet in a moment she'll she'll weigh
in I don't know actually I don't know if
she watches it live or watches it
recorded I think she watches it recorded
Maybe
but
um I don't think there's anybody who
disagrees that expectations affect
performance and nobody would disagree
that telling people that they've got
this you know invisible yoke on them
called
systemic racism that's got to affect
performance it just has to
teachers also know the parents are
mostly to blame when the kids are a
disaster
I don't know
I mean the kids are partly they're
partly to blame
all right that's All For You YouTube
thanks for listening I'm going to talk
well let's see if I got my message here
uh okay no that wasn't what I was
expecting
all right that's all for now YouTube
