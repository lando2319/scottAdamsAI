I think it was operator error in this
case uh there are many things which have
to be pressed and checked and double
checked and uh turns out I didn't check
and double check everything but now I
have and now where the world is a good
place and
[Music]
uh good morning and welcome to the
highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adam there's
never been a finer time in your life if
You' like to take this up to levels that
nobody can even understand all you need
for that is a cover of muger a glass of
tanker chel d and a canteen Jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine hit
of the day thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and appens now
go oh that was good man was that worth
waiting for huh I hope you were uh
wondering what happened to me cuz I'm so
I'm so dependable you probably said what
happened is he
alive no being on time is sort of my
thing so if I'm late something went
wrong all right uh let's start with what
I call the least surprising
news this will be my new uh segment
least surprising news uh today we
learned that Playboy model Crystal
Hefner admits she was never in love with
late husband Hugh
Hefner well now that changes
everything it's about time she admitted
that she married him just for the
sex I mean I I'm not reading her mind I
just assume I just assume it was pure
animal lust and not it was never love
[Music]
never least surprising
news uh number two in our least
surprising news uh you know the
story all right this one is good today's
going to be very funny by the way
because all the news is just funny by it
itself like even the tragic news is
funny today and you know that's not
right but it
is so uh you know the whole of Bill lman
being an activist trying to get rid of
the president of Harvard because
she uh in the end because she was a
plagiarist but before that it was
because she didn't seem to have the
right attitude about the Gaza Israel's
situation so Harvard uh you know she she
did step down and so it looked like a
big victory for the people who were
against
anti-semitism and for some kind of you
know reasonableness in the college so
that was a big victory so let's uh check
in to see how that
went um oh here's good news Harvard as
appointed uh the interim president
appointed a uh an anti-Semitism task
force well that's just what they needed
I mean that's the sort of thing that
would make Bill Amman happy right so
they got themselves an anti-m ISM task
force let's see who did they who did
they assign to the task force to be a
co-chair oh well um somebody who has
been widely accused of being
anti-semitic and as uh referred to
Israel as an apartheid state okay so
they made it worse they made it worse uh
as Bill Amman uh posted today on X
Harvard continues on its path to
Darkness
Well that took one week was it one week
from Total Victory against wokeness to
okay it got worse the anti-Semitism task
force is somebody who's been widely
accused of being
anti-semitic so apparently they're not
even
trying but you know that's just Harvard
that's just Harvard it's not like
there's any craziness going on anywhere
else oh there is
uh Jonathan tur Le's talking about Penn
State and according to their student
newspaper the Pennsylvania student yeah
the daily
Pennsylvania uh They said that the
faculty members are panicked because
there's a push to get some what they
call diversity of
opinion Viewpoint
diversity so because the college is
mostly you know left leading people
there's a push to get you know maybe
some conservative voices in there but
the faculty says that they're going to
quit and it's the end of the world if uh
there are any alternative voices because
they love their free speech not
alternative voices though I love Free
Speech when it's about me but the people
I disagree with no no I will quit if you
let them have anything to say with my
University so everybody who's been
saying that a college degree is
worthless you're the winners you're the
winners uh did I did I mention that all
of the news is funny today all right
here's the next one uh the post
millennial is reporting that uh one of
the squad members you know the squad in
Congress Jamal Bowman he's demanding uh
oh he has a specific number for
reparations for black Americans uh
checking his math uh he says he thinks
the right number would be U
approximately 14
trillion 14
trillion I like that they're not even
trying now if you try to take 14
trillion from the rest of the country
that's not going to go well yeah no
that's not going to go well at
all so that how can I even treat this
story is a serious news
story am I wrong that the news is just
pure out is pure humor at this point
there's no
way that that's a serious story $4
trillion all right here's another funny
one
um so Joe
Biden this is according to NBC news now
remember you have to know the players so
NBC News is
considered maybe the least credible of
the news entities you know often accused
of being in the bag for the CIA or
really just being a CIA news entity I
don't know if that's true but they act
like it uh so they report that Joe Biden
President Biden has said a two-state
solution is not impossible with
Netanyahu in office adding that he
believes the Israeli Israeli Prime
Minister could change his
mind so that's totally possible that
netan who would change his mind about oh
I don't know the survival of
Israel how is this
serious how in the world are we supposed
to take that serious you think Netanyahu
is going to change his mind about a
two-state solution because Joe Biden
talked him into it I don't think
so so uh as someone pointed out to me
this morning it looks like Biden has
mentioned has entered what we
call the fourth
dementia he's entered the fourth
dementia I didn't make that up but it's
very
funny all right um so so that's the good
news the good news is that Biden thinks
that he can get Netanyahu to to moderate
and you know maybe be a little less
extreme let's see how that's working oh
other news uh Israel just killed a bunch
of of uh Iranian
uh Islamic revolutionary guard
leaders uh where did that do that in the
Syrian capital of
Damascus yeah so there's lots of
evidence that Netanyahu is
moderating how in the world do we take
Biden
seriously the two-state solution yeah
that's going to happen if there's any
states left when they're done
well what else is funny uh Ian Bremer is
attending the world economic Forum this
week and he reports that the China China
delegation is gigantic so China's going
all in on the world economic forum and
they're they're apparently the people
they brought are work in the crowd for
Chinese Investments so China is looking
for more foreign investment because
their economy is not doing so well and
Eden Bremer reports that they're not
getting the best reception to that
because people are telling China that
they are
quote uh not as investable as they could
be and they're a little more interested
in India and maybe some other
countries so apparently the investment
Community has decided that they want to
see other people like
India so that's very very surprising
that China is not only too risky for
business business but it's too risky to
invest in who saw that coming since 2018
when I told you I was going to make that
happen but it's a total
coincidence so here's something I
learned today you want to have your head
blown straight off you know all that
fenel that's coming into America and
killing people by the hundreds of
thousands and you know that the
precursors are coming from China and
they go to the cartel and the cartels
finish it up and turn into fenadol and
put it in drugs and kill
Americans but what I didn't know is that
there's exactly one company in China
that makes all those precursors and he
illegally sends them to the
cartel let me say that
again America knows the name of the
company and the location of the building
and there's only one and all of the
fenel comes from one address
and it's not already a smoldering crater
in the
ground what is going on
here I mean really do you think that I
mean I Trump didn't fix it either so
whatever the problem is Trump didn't fix
it I feel like I would give um president
XI an
ultimatum there's a building that's
going to disappear in 5 hours unless you
disappear at first
so you can bomb your own building you
know G get your people out of there so
that nobody gets killed you can destroy
your own building or there's going to be
a mother of all bombs that falls on it
and if you want World War I you got
it the we're already in World
War III I mean they're killing over
100,000 Americans intentionally every
year no if you want World War III Bring
it on I think it's time to just call the
bluff I think you need to just take that
building out now probably the reason we
don't do that is that we're doing just
as many up things to China and if
China responded the same way probably it
would get way on a hand really fast so
there might be things that our
government is hiding from
us that might be a limitation on why
they can't stop this problem I feel like
there's something we don't know like at
the base of it but how much are you
Blown Away by the fact that there's a
specific building we even have a
photograph of it we know where it is and
what they're doing and there's only one
and we let that stay in business and we
ask them politely to do something about
it for the last five years we've been
asking them for five years to stop doing
it all they have to do is say stop doing
it and it'll be
over yeah so I'm going to assume that
that's exactly what it looks like that
there is some kind of corruption
involved because there's no way we can't
make that problem go away at least the
precursor
problem weird but anyway uh here's my
prediction in the end fentel is going to
kill more Chinese citizens than
Americans that's my new prediction in
the
end fentel will kill more Chinese
citizens than
Americans
wow and here's how that's going to
happen China is going to remain
uninvestable as long as there's a
sentinel Factory in
China and I don't know what that does to
the Chinese economy but being
uninvestable for the next 20 years is
not going to be good and I would think
that that level of
economic um destruction would probably
kill more Chinese citizens in the long
run so here's what I think you need to
do if you're an American Business person
if you're investing in China when you
know that they have a factory making
fentin all precursors and send them here
and all they have to do is say no and it
would stop and you're investing in China
you're my
enemy right if you're an American
company and you're making a new
investment if you're already there like
Tesla that's a different situation you
probably have to hang out there but if
you're making a new investment in China
you are my
enemy and Immortal
enemy I'm not going to kill any body but
I would want you dead well let me say it
as clearly as possible if you're an
American
CEO and you make an investment in this
country that still has this fentel
Factory I want you dead I don't want
anybody to kill you I'm not in favor of
violence is what I like is what I want
I'd like you to be hit by a car I'd like
you to fall off a cliff I'd like you to
take a an overdose and die of an
overdose I want you dead
right so I don't want this to be I don't
want this to feel like an ordinary topic
where I say oh I would like tax reform
you don't well that's too bad I wish I
wish I got it no it's not that it's not
like you you want a different political
candidate than I do oh well okay you win
this time it's not that no if you're
putting a new investment in China I want
you dead I want your cold
 corpse laying on the ground I
don't care if you got you're a good
father I don't care if you you've been a
great citizen up to that point if you
knowingly put one penny into
that evil
country you are my enemy and I'm not
going to do anything I mean I'm not
physically going to act against anybody
but I want you dead I want you
dead is that clear enough
and I'd love to hear your name if
there's somebody making a new investment
in China an American I'd like to know
who you are I'm not going to do anything
right I'm not going to cause any trouble
but I'd like to know your name I just
like to know your
name all
right uh the Blackstone CEO who's also
at the Double World economic uh
Forum Mr
schwarzman he told the Davos crowd that
uh maybe the US is not prepared for four
more years of Biden's $2 trillion
deficits a million illegals per year and
debt to GDP ratio that's going out of
control that's right
Blackstone Blackstone is not just a big
Financial
entity they are really
big they are really big so that's pretty
amazing it's it's Black Stone not Black
Rock um anyway so but the good
news uh the good news is that Biden is
getting things done right so maybe there
these Financial people like uh you know
maybe Jamie Diamond who's starting to
say Trump got some things right and the
Blackstone CEO is didn't say anything
Pro Trump but he's not really Pro Pro
Biden and there's likely to be one
alternative but on the good news
President Biden is getting some stuff
done so here's a news report of Biden
getting some stuff done he said himself
in the post on next he said today prime
minister Netanyahu and I discussed
efforts to secure the release of all
hostages held by Hamas well that's good
and we review we reviewed moves to
increase humanitarian aid for civilians
oh okay that sounds good while keeping
military pressure on Hamas oh that's
good too and I re reiterated Israel's
responsibility to protect civilians so
while you were doing practically nothing
useful President Biden was discussing he
was
reviewing but on top of that he was
reiterating so a lot of people would
wake up and they don't have the energy
that he has you know he a lot of his
staff is saying oh we can't even keep up
with him like a lot of the staff they'd
W up in the morning and they say I
barely have the energy to
discuss and then there's the president
he's discussing he's reviewing and then
he's reiterating I'm like my God how
does anybody keep up with that so and if
you're trying to decide between Trump
and Biden should it be come down to that
um I'm going to be honest I like to say
a lot of good things about Trump but I
don't know if he could keep up with this
on a good day Trump is going to be be
maybe do some reiterating and maybe a
little reviewing but I don't know if
he's going to get any discussing done in
the same day like sometimes Trump will
do two on a three at best he'll review
and reiterate sometimes he'll discuss
and reiterate but will he ever discuss
review and reiterate I don't think so so
that's why you need a Biden he's like
the Energizer Bunny of doing absolutely
 nothing that we need done but he
can do it with the greatest energy and
uh and
and I like his thoroughness too because
a lot of people would have stopped with
the discussing and reviewing but he
reiterated got that going for
us well it's getting harder and harder
to compliment Joe Biden as his uh
supporter Jim
kurn he's one of the co-chairs of the
campaign said uh so kurn said that the
polls showing a drop in support for
Biden among black Americans are
misinformation do you know how kurn
knows that the polls are wrong and
support for black support by black
citizens for Trump I'm sorry for Biden
is actually pretty
good well he said this he said I don't
believe them talking about the BS
because I talk to black people all the
time I have three black daughters they
tell me
differently so there you go so you got
the polls on one hand all say the same
story but um as Clyburn points you
cannot trust the polls because when you
talk to black people such as his three
daughters you know they they've got a
whole different
opinion I've got an update an update um
the update is two of two of Jim kurn's
three daughters have just endorsed Trump
okay all right well that's embarrassing
no that didn't happen but wouldn't that
be funny his best argument is that he
talked to his daughters but wouldn't it
be funny if two and a three said not so
sure it didn't happen but it would be
hilarious if it
did
well you know if I said that Biden
wasn't helping that's not exactly true
he's getting a lot done
including uh he gave some dating advice
at a recent
event um and I've been working on my
Biden impression if you don't mind I'm
going to do some impressions today I
know usually you do Impressions you know
but I feel like if you're a public
figure you should have at least a few
Impressions so I'd like to give Biden's
uh dating
advice and I think he said and I
quote that was pretty good wasn't it all
right but uh the words I believe he said
uh I consulted an interpreter and a
psychic and I think what he said was was
I tell every young man that's telling me
I'm thinking of getting married you have
any advice I said yeah pick a family
with five sisters or
more because that way at least one of
them will love
you
um what is he trying to tell
us you know if I had a son who famously
dated his brother's
widow I'm not sure my dating advice
would be find a find a wife Who's Got
Five Sisters
but I don't know seems to be working for
him uh so I guess Biden's
been I don't know is is he is he
admitting to Paulie Emory with the
entire Jill Biden family I don't know
exactly what he's trying to say here
but thank God we've got this man leading
our country with his good
advice all right but um how's the world
going under uh
Biden well New York Post says that uh
there's a trans golfer Haley Davidson
who won a women's
tournament and he's which gave him a
better chance of qualifying for the
LPGA so trans golfer Haley Davidson
congratulations uh good win and you know
I I'd like to give a shout out to all
the trans athletes who are winning in
the women's sports now um especially in
track and
field you know I I think it would be you
know inappropriate for a trans athlete
to be let's say a professional boxer I
mean that feels like something you
should prevent just to keep people safe
but you know golf is non-con Sport right
so yeah and I think track and field
would be another one
so under Biden um you know a lot of
people criticize Biden but at least he
made the trans run on
time no
anybody
no okay that was a lot of work to get to
that joke and it wasn't worth it was it
all right no um so yes so uh in related
news uh this trans golfer Haley Davidson
uh he's he's in the running to be on the
cover of Sports Illustrated so Sports
Illustrated is interested in and putting
uh her on the
cover oh we have an update we have an
update the entire staff of Sports
Illustrated was just notified that their
jobs were being
eliminated well that's probably not
related I'm going to call that a
coincidence
yeah um but oh I have an update on this
story tooo got an update just come in um
they're it looks like they're going to
sell the company Sports Illustrated and
they're going to lean more towards uh
trans athletes on the cover because that
worked out so well and they're going to
change the name from Sports Illustrated
to uh bulge in your shorts
Illustrated bulge in your shorts
Illustrated anybody no is that funny no
all right it's just that's just unkind
that's just
unkind all right it's not true I'm
making up the news today well in other
news Trump uh confused Pelosi with uh
Nikki Haley and when talking about the
failure of uh getting enough Security on
January 6 he said Nikki Haley when he
meant Pelosi now is that
dementia are you worried about that
well you know you maybe you could be if
you wanted to but let let me tell you my
take on
this I have a problem where uh the way
my memory works is it's not a
photographic
memory I store things in buckets if
they're similar so my mind takes
anything that's similar and puts it in
the same bucket and then it's confusing
because you get all the similar things
in the bucket is Nancy po
similar to Nikki
Haley in my mind kind of yes weirdly
yeah kind of yes you see it don't you
I'm looking at the comments most of you
see it too now obviously it's a
different political party but you know
people accuse Nikki Hy of being too much
of a in the bag for a Democrat and stuff
like that so I can totally see how you
would pull one name out of the bucket
instead of the other other name because
in your mind they kind of run together
so I feel like it's more of that than
any kind of mental
decline although at that age you gota
you you got to be careful all right
um the NFL announced that they're going
to have what they call the black
national anthem performed at the Super
Bowl you know it's good that we have a
national anthem and then also a black
National
Anthem because the the regular national
anthem um is really a call for Unity is
sort of a thing that you know brings us
all together and then the black national
anthem is obviously a call for
disunity um and it just breaks even so
anybody who like doesn't like too much
patriotism or they don't like too much
disunity if you have them together they
actually cancel out it's like neither of
them happened so
uh I'm totally in favor of this you
can't have too much patriotism but you
don't want too much disunity so you put
them together and they it's just it
comes to
zero um this next
story well I'm going to have to bring in
a special guest for the next story all
right so excuse me for a moment a quick
uh reward Rob change special
guest uh the special are you ready you
you know yeah no put the tea down put
the tea down it's time to get on stage
all right just I only need you for a
second just a minute just a all
right oh hello this this is Boris
Johnson Boris Johnson from Great
Britain and uh I've got some things to
say um I'm going to say that the world
would be more stable under Trump
and I'm going to mock the global
wera for trembling so violently at the
idea of trump
returning Boris
Johnson
now I know what you're saying you're
saying that doesn't look like Boris
Johnson to
me that looks like Joy Reed of
MSNBC but you'd be wrong this is Boris
Johnson I'm working hard on my
Impressions so that you could tell them
apart more easily but for now it's a
little confusing I know all right so
anyway so Boris Johnson likes Trump and
the Blackstone CEO likes Trump and Jamie
Diamond says Trump's okay who else likes
Trump oh Tim Scott just endorse
Trump Tim Scott okay so we got the Tim
Scott
endorsement um is there anybody else who
likes
Trump let's see oh shamain the god
uh says his listeners are fed up with
the migration issue
and it looks like Republicans were
right
so head of
Blackstone yeah okay Boris Johnson other
countries yeah do you see a trend is any
kind of a trend developing
here I think a little bit of a trend
um here's the thing so Charlamagne the
God says that the black community he's
talking to is very much uh upset about
the migration and the effect it's having
on their Community but do you think
immigration is really that bad I mean
aren't we making a big deal about it I
mean how bad is it you know Trump said
that you know they're like criminal
elements and stuff are you really
worried about all these criminal cartel
elements I mean how scary are they
really see the next story uh cartel
leaves a cooler full of heads at a gas
station in
Mexico that Daily Mail says yeah it was
a cooler filled with severed heads some
kind of a message to a neighboring uh
another cartel it seems yeah cooler full
heads now am I the only one who
wonders how many heads can you fit in a
cooler like I know that's not really
right on top of the main story but I
feel like it's left
out and I would feel different if it
were three heads versus I don't know
what what do you think would be the
maximum head count for a
cooler
six six to
eight yeah and if it was only three
heads would they say it was a cooler
full of heads and like how many heads
would you have to put in a cooler before
you could say it's full of
heads like if your cooler only had you
know was only filled up halfway with
heads would that be an exaggeration to
say this cooler is full of heads now I
feel like that would be hyperbole what
you should say is there's like like only
half of this cooler is full of heads
they showed a block down picture and I
swear it was only half half full of
heads so if you're all worried about oh
the cartel is going to come up here you
know as soon as they across the border
it's going to be like bad in America
will you stop being a this cooler
was no more than half full of
heads if you're going to get like all oh
half half a cooler of heads and you're
like panicking over half a
cooler toughen up
buttercup I'm going to need a at least
three coolers ah heads full no half
coolers before I even get engaged in
this question for now it's all good half
a cooler I'd keep an eye on it but it's
nothing to worry about
yet all right
uh all kidding aside here's
my here's my prediction about
immigration do you know how the public
through the
pandemic and now we say as
one okay you fooled this
once you're not going to do that to us
again because you know what we're not
going to forget the last
pandemic you can try but you're not
going to do that
again now let's talk about migration and
immigration look what whoever whoever's
in charge we don't even know who's in
charge which is weird
look what they're doing to
us and I'm going to say doing to us it's
not a policy decision there there's
nobody who decided that it should do
this they are
us the citizens whoever they is I don't
even know who's in charge but we are
getting so
screwed and let me put it this
way I'm just going to say it
once we're not going to forget that
this isn't like the other
stuff this isn't like anything else
we're not going to forget they opened
the
door right if you think that the
Democrats can survive this as a
political party I think you're wrong I
think this is actually the end of the
Democrats as a viable institution maybe
for a decade or longer we're not going
to forget this this is not like the
other things you just open the door and
let everybody in it's not an opinion
it's not a difference in preference
because you can see the the Democrats
were not crazy and the Republicans we
all agree on this the the country is
very unified on this question and we're
not going to forget the black Americans
they're not going to forget because
you're them hard and everybody
El is getting the same we're not
going to forget so in my
opinion I cheekily asked a survey how
many more months of uh unfettered
immigration before the Republicans will
have the White House all of Congress and
the
courts and the answer is we're probably
already there I think we're already
there in my opinion short of cheating
which I do expect to happen um short of
cheating there isn't any real way that
um Democrats could hold the house or
hold any power in Congress um I I think
the Count's
done I think we're not going to forget I
don't think we're going to forgive
because you shouldn't this is not a
forgivable act I forgive all mistakes
actually I forgive probably at least
three qus of all the mistakes that were
made in the pandemic I actually forgive
as bad as they were and I said that in
advance because we'd just be confused
if you make a mistake in the fog of War
I'm not going to like it but I'm going
to forgive you fog of war did the best
you could this is not anybody doing the
best they could do you
agree nothing about the Border situation
is anybody doing the best they can
nobody nobody even really trying all
right now I'm not talk about the rank
and file workers but at the leadership
level nobody's
trying and they're not hiding it too
hard the fact that they're not hiding
they're not
trying is a whole different level of
 that we haven't
seen
yeah May Arcus said it's because of
global
warming of course he
did um let me talk about
mayorcas so mayorcas is getting you know
um grilled by let's say representative
Higgins says he wants to um impeach him
impeach
him I feel like that's a little light
here's what you should do you should
check his finances right
away because the only explanation that I
can understand is that he is
corrupt I would check mayor's finances
let's take a look at his bank account
because I don't see any possibility that
he's not corrupt now I don't know that
it would show up in his his bank account
necessarily if he's smart but I think
his finances need to be looked at
because if somebody acts exactly like
they're bought off by the
cartel you should check to see if
they're bought off by the cartel now I
don't have proof of that but if you have
a public leader who acts exactly like
they're corrupt and bought off by
somebody specifically you you'd even
know who did it you wouldn't even have
to wonder who the suspect was right yeah
so yeah let's let's look into his uh
let's look into his finances because if
he'd done some kind of a job that looked
like he was just
incompetent I would say all right well
it's probably just a capability problem
but it's not a capability problem it's
not even close to that yeah I'd look
into his finances it's time to do
that all right so there's a xylazine
proxy war in Philadelphia what's that
mean so xylazine is that I think it's
the horse tranquilizer that people are
adding to the fentol or something making
it even
worse so it's just a horrible drug but
apparently there's some kind of a proxy
war because there are two Chinese
entities creating the
drug and they're competing with each
other so one makes a liquid form that
the cartels like because it's expensive
so they can make more money but a
Chinese company also made a powdered
form which would be so much less
expensive that the cartels wouldn't make
money so apparently the way the cartels
can wipe out the
competitors is they just send a message
with a dollar amount and the gangs just
run and try to kill anybody they can to
get the
reward just think about that all China
has to do to kill a drug dealer in
Philadelphia is to send a message on t
or whatever they use they they do a
picture in the name of the person and
they put a price tag on it and by the
end of the day gangs have all swarmed
around and and killed them to see who
could be the first to to collect the
Bounty allegedly that's what's
happening so yeah
China great job
China so the funny Willis story is funny
the the Sani is Wills is the uh uh
Attorney General en what is she the uh
she's the Fulton County district
attorney district attorney sorry and
she's the one who's having the affair
with a married guy who was not qualified
for the job of Prosecuting Trump but he
got the job and then he was way overpaid
and then he used some of the money that
she way overpaid him to take her on a
luxury vacation or
two so as Mike cernovich point points
out and you should have seen this
yourself that is a classic money
laundering
scheme I will overpay you if you kick
some
back now here's the only question I have
about this so this is one of four court
cases do I have that right is there now
there are now four Trump related legal
jeopardies
right here here's a question for you do
you think that the prosecutors in all
four
cases have committed more or fewer
crimes than
Trump what do you think I'll bet you if
you looked into the financial lives of
all the prosecutors you'd find you'd
find crime and the reason I say that is
because we live in a black mail Ury and
a and a you know a bribe Ury so probably
everybody who's doing something sketchy
is getting some extra money from
somebody so yeah probably all of the
prosecutors are dirty I don't have
specific evidence I'm just saying that
if you can get somebody to do something
this messed up that they know is wrong
from a legal perspective probably it's
not just Trump
hatred probably
somebody's got a promise promotion or is
getting some money some indirect way or
they're or they're blackmailed because
they're dirty and some boy yeah
basically every part of this is uh
bad yeah we I would expect something on
Jack Smith too I I think there might be
a Jack Smith Story coming just a guess
speaking of
that there's a story breaking who knows
what is true and what is not that Nikki
hilly cheated on her husband flagrantly
before she was governor and you know
several different men it was a lobbyist
and somebody else blah blah blah blah
um but here's here's the knowing the
players part so the thing you have to
know is that uh Reed Hoffman um very
rich uh donor to the Democrats is
backing Nikki
hilly uh financially but also backing
EEG Carroll's um lawsuit against
Trump so one bill
is making a is backing a sexual related
case against Trump while the same
billionaire is full-throated Le at least
with his money backing Nikki Haley
against
Trump and somehow the Trump opposition
research waited until now to dump this
opposition research now I'm assuming it
came from some Trump prot trump area you
know who else would it be
but do you think it's a coincidence that
Reed Hoffman goes after Trump for this
slimy sexual part of the the story you
know the least political part of it and
then Trump says if you keep going after
me I'm going to take out your favorite
with something in the the same category
to me this looks like mutually sure
destruction to me this looks like okay
if you're going to go after the sexual
stuff we're going to take out your
candidate the same
way so it might be a
coincidence it might be a coincidence
that there's a reed Hoffman connection
with you know those two stories that
seem somehow related to this new
information it might be but the the
weirdest part is that they waited so
long and the funny thing is that the the
news says that um that Trump has said he
wouldn't consider Nikki hilly for a vice
president
now I think the fact that this news just
dropped told you everything you needed
to know about whether Trump was
considering her for vice president
because somebody on the Trump side of
things dropped this probably with
permission so she's being taken out yeah
uh apparently the uh the escalation has
started so to the extent that people
believe the Democrats were trying to you
know rig things of the Nikki hilly
somehow
ends up the president it looks like
there are forces that are going to make
sure that doesn't
happen now my own opinion is I don't
care what Nikki hilly did in her
personal life I I can't be so
hypocritical that I say I don't care
what Trump did I don't care what JFK
did I don't care what Clinton
did and I'm not going to care what Nikki
hilly did or did not do and we don't
even know if it's true right I'm not
going to assume it's true um so these
things are not really related to their
work performance but if EEG Carrol is
going to be part of the
conversation this is too it's mutually
assured destruction and Trump didn't
start it Trump didn't start the mutually
assured destruction but it looks like he
paid it off looks like he paid that
bill uh there's a German
newspaper
uh Spiegel that predicts unpredictable
times for Europe if dictator Trump they
call him dictator Trump wins the US
election that's right a German
newspaper predicts unpredictable times
you know that's so different than our
past you know what is weird about the
history it was all
predictable yeah because that's the way
the news works it's
predictable why do we have news
organizations why why does spiegel even
exist as a newspaper
if the news is predictable oh I guess
it's the first time we've ever needed a
newspaper because now the news is not
predictable because of
trump you know what I say to
that shut up hit
Ville yeah shut up
hillville um if if swisserland would
like to talk to us about our dictator
I'm open to that yeah let's see you have
to say if uh Sri Lanka says you know I'd
like to talk to you about Trump I feel
like he's might be a little
dictator I'd say Sri Lanka I'm here for
you let's let's hear what you have to
say maybe we can make you feel better
about this what if Germany decides to
tell us that we're electing a
dictator shut up
pitville all right uh Trump was deposed
in one of these cases I forget which one
it do recently and he was claiming he
avoided nuclear Holocaust with North
North Korea saved millions of
lives and uh wasn't really paying
attention to whatever this dumb was
that they were accusing him of um
yeah so I think that's a fair a fair
claim Glenn Beck has uh apparently
president Trump called him and asked him
for his opinion who he should pick for a
vice president what do you think about
that what do what do you think about
Trump Consulting with Glenn back and he
wouldn't be the only one obviously he's
talking to other media people other
advisers but what do you think about the
fact that he asked Glen Beck's
opinion A+ A+ yeah number
one who who's got a better opinion of
stuff like this right I would ask Glenn
Beck his opinion too if I could
right so he's the right one to ask but
he's not the only right one because he's
you know as Glenn Beck says he's
obviously talking to a number of
people but Glenn Beck's take is a V all
the way that he's the obvious choice for
vice president now I have and oh here's
the other thing he says about V uh so
glenbeck says that V is like Trump but
with a photographic memory and that V
would be the
perfect um perfect person to have
Trump's back because he can explain
Trump better than Trump can explain
himself frankly
so I agree with all of that from
glenbeck
um but here's the thing I don't know if
picking the vice presidency is about
capability in my
lifetime what candidate has picked a
vice president who was
capable just Clinton and Gore I think
that was a case and
Bush yeah Reagan and Bush I don't know
yeah Bush actually Bush senior was a
good president so I'll give you that
one but uh I'm not sure that capability
is always the the main thing you know
often it's what the state or demographic
or stuff like that and here's the real
question to me do you think Trump is
confident enough to have a vice
president that
strong because it's really confidence
question because he would have to know
that sooner or later he V would say
something that he disagreed with and
then you know would he be comfortable
working that
out you know um and he would have to
know also that V would be persuasive you
know within the administration is he
okay with that I would be I would be
okay with that um so this is sort of a
test for
Trump
I'm I'm a little lukewarm on this for
two reasons I'm lukewarm on V's vice
president not that he wouldn't be the
best choice because he would be but I
don't know that it's good for him
because it could be a you know sort of a
a death
job you know I'd hate to have him uh
have his potential extinguished by you
know having to be that close to the
flame for four years so that'd be a
little dicey on the other hand V is the
best uh assassination insurance by far
so I mean having him there would make
you feel a lot more comfortable about
Trump's
age let me say this about vake if Trump
lost the step I think V would tell you
name anybody else who would think about
that if Trump lost a step and it became
clear to the
Insiders V might be the only person in
in the United
States not just the only politician and
he's barely a politician he's probably
well Tulsi would too yeah you know
you're right about that I'll give you
Tulsi I'll give you that one tuls is a
strong choice in my opinion V's a strong
choice I would trust both of them yeah
you got me on that one I would trust
both of them to tell the public if a
change needed to be made
and that's sort of the ultimate
compliment for honesty because there
there would be no higher challenge for
honesty than to call out your own your
own boss in in that specific situation
so you need somebody you can trust to do
that and that's a really high bar but I
would put the V above the bar and I
would put I would put tulsy above that
as well I would trust both of
them all right all
right so but we'll see if Trump is
confident enough to have a vice
president that strong um I think he
is so the thing I I I keep telling you
because I think at some point it'll be
more obvious Trump loves smart people
he's very consistent about that and so
that would presumably he'd like V extra
because he's the smartest one we've seen
in a long time so I think Trump is
actually confident enough to have
somebody that is strong in his
administration I think he
is so we'll see uh Bill M says America
isn't about right or left it's normal
versus crazy and he had a he had a good
routine about that now you agree with
that don't you so this is a version of
what I've been saying that we're not
dealing with left versus right anymore
we left that frame a while ago we're
literally dealing with bad crazy
versus people who are at least
trying you could disagree with them but
at least they're trying you know at
least they're suggesting things that on
paper make sense even if they don't work
you know maybe you have to test it but
yeah so let's do the tour Bill Maher
he's not obviously he's not a Trump
supporter but he is very much giving it
to the Democrats and uh if he didn't
have a personal history with
Trump I do
suspect that perhaps
uh well perhaps uh he's not a supporter
per se but he doesn't seem to be super
pro Biden either then you got Glenn Beck
and V you've got the Blackstone CEO
you've got Charlamagne the God you've
got Tim Scott do you see a pattern
yet the the pattern is pretty clear
there there doesn't seem to be any way
that Biden could win the
election
but I'm thinking more and more that he
might make it why why is everybody
yelling lomer at me in the comments did
Laura lomer do something recently in the
news that I
missed give give me a hint don't say
Lumar lumor lumer
just give me any kind of hint why you're
saying
that oh for a
spokesperson yeah no I don't think Laura
lumer will be hired on the payroll um
but she's a big Trump
supporter all
right and that ladies and
gentlemen is my show for
today but the one thing you probably
wondered
is why can't I get a better Trump wig
well let's try this one
out
better this one has more orange in
it is this the
one
no now uh but I also have to do my uh
impression
now let's see if I if I do the Trump
dance can I pull it all
together yeah if you're if you're just
listening to it you missed the greatest
impression of the Trump dance of all
time if I do say so myself all right
ladies and gentlemen I believe this is
the uh the conclusion of the greatest
show you've ever seen today thanks for
joining sorry I was late with my own
uh lack of uh ability to push the right
buttons but I'll see you tomorrow
morning for another incredible episode
of coffee with Scott Adams thanks for
joining
