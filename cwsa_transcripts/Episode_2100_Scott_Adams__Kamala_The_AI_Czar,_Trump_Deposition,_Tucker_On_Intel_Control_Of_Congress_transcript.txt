Papa
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never been happier
today will be maybe more amazing than
usual because the news has served up
funny stories which we like no there
will be no stories of giant phallus
icebergs today but still still we'll
make something out of it it's amazing
how we can do that
all right we're going to go private here
on locals and if you'd like to take your
experience up a notch well all you need
is a cup or a mug or a glass a tanker
chalices tie on the Kim teen Joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine here today the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
it happens now go
yeah that's how to start your morning
just like that you ready now now are you
ready
well you should be
well uh yesterday in the news uh I'd
like to summarize the headlines from all
of the major news entities that I
checked today
a summary
some British stuff happened yesterday
some British stuff
I believe there were a colorful outfits
involved
you know my trouble with the monarchy
is that not that is not fun and
interesting but that it feels more like
somebody's Hobby
doesn't it
like it doesn't feel like a news event
it feels like a hobby
oh I really like talking about the
Royals well that's a hobby
or I really like seeing what outfits
they wear and the pageant and the
ceremony
it's like a dog show it's like any other
hobby you like the sporting event I'm
not entirely sure it deserves all of our
headlines in the United States
and I'm in favor of the Royal Family
no problem with it people like it
if you like your king keep your king
but I don't know why that I don't know
why it's news
but there's a lot of it however the news
of uh coordinating a new king and Great
Britain pales in comparison to the news
that Kamala Harris has been selected as
the aisar
what
is that the is the simulation messing
with us
did the president of the United States
literally select the least intelligent
politician of all time to be the Czar of
an advanced intelligence
that didn't really happen did it no
did that really really happen
tell me that didn't happen
that couldn't have possibly happened in
the real world
it did
what's going on I mean come on come on
that's too far that's just too far
all right well that happened
uh whereas Dana Perino said quote what
made Biden think this was a good idea
Dana Perino with her
understatement of the century
well let's give somebody who's
famous for being a babbling idiot who do
we have who do we have
um well there's this guy Bob who's
always you know on the street saying
nonsense no Bob is not famous enough we
need somebody who's famous for being a
babbling idiot
well we got I got an idea
got a vice president
all right well I don't know how that
conversation went down but it's funny
either way
uh we found out that Tick Tock had been
tracking your your watching of gay
content on Tick Tock so they had a list
of people who like to watch gay content
on tick tock
that's that's no problem is it
and some people said that maybe for
countries that were less open than let's
say the United States such information
could be used for blackmail well
I got news for you you could use that
for blackmail in the United States too
because there got to be people who do
not identify as lgbtq who for whatever
reason are looking at the content
and you know as the article said it
doesn't mean that they are members they
might just be interested in the content
for whatever reason and uh
I thought well here's one more reason to
get rid of tick tock now Tick Tock says
they got rid of that feature that
tracking feature for the United States
because I guess the U.S Tick Tock is at
least a little bit walled off in some
way but
how do you like the fact that they could
do it
forget about the fact that they did it
how about the fact that they can do it
it's just one of those things they can
do it actually would appear right on the
dashboard
a list of people who looked at all the
uh the gay stuff on tick tock
what else what else do they have a list
for
we know they have a button for heat they
can make any any posts go viral
it just it's just mind-boggling that
it's still legal in the U.S
our our government is just so corrupt
that the simplest thing the most obvious
simplest thing can't pull it off that's
such an obvious uh tell for corruption
probably China interests I guess
well here's something I never thought
would happen uh the sport of bicycle
racing became interesting
did anybody see that coming
you know it wasn't until the uh was it
Lance Armstrong who had one testicle and
uh performance enhancing drugs I said
now that's guys interesting the bicycle
riding
not so interesting but at least the star
is interesting you know he's doing some
some stuff
uh but now the uh
tennis Legend Martinez
is one of the people complaining about a
biological well let's say a trans woman
uh winning some big bicycle race in
Mexico New Mexico
Austin Phillips
winning the women's overall category
now
do you think that it's like extra vexing
because Austin didn't bother to change
Austin's name from a male sounding name
to a female sounding name when Austin
transitioned
don't you feel that the women in that
race
were a little extra extra mad
because because Austin is still called
Austin and won the race
now I don't think there's anything less
important than bicycle racing maybe in
the whole world it's hard to think of
anything less important than that
who is the best at
pumping this bicycle up a Long Mountain
I don't care
does it matter who's the best at that
oh but they did find a way to make it
interesting by having some controversy
injected into the sports so I'm going to
say that's a plus
um not so good for the women who wanted
to be the winner but uh
what here's so here's an interesting
question
in my opinion what is the point
the purpose of bicycle racing
what is his purpose
go I mean besides making money of course
but what's his purpose
is it for the benefit of the athletes
or is it because it's a professional
sport or is it for the benefit of The
Observers
if it's for the benefit of The Observers
I think the situation is fine because it
gave the Observer something to talk
about other than all that bicycle sure
went fast
nothing else to talk about
so if it's for the if bicycle racing is
for the benefit of the athletes then
some of them probably have something to
complain about
because the female athletes
you know were were
disadvantaged as some would say
but apparently this particular
competitor
was under the limits of testosterone
so they do have some limits on your
testosterone level and this this athlete
passed that limit
still
still sad athlete who is larger in size
and some would say that was unfair
but anything to make bicycle racing more
interesting I'm in favor of
well Tucker has a
sort of emerged he did a interview I saw
with uh Tulsi gabbard
and he continues to make news
and he said you he told it a fascinating
story about how
he got interested in Trump from not
being interested at all in the beginning
and he he said it was because Trump kept
asking questions
that
were only obvious questions after you
heard them
such as why are we funding NATO
that would be one example that Tucker
gave and and Tucker said quite
reasonably I never even thought about it
like it was never even a question but as
soon as he asked the question everybody
got mad
And when everybody got mad and would be
too angry to answer the question
Tucker realized there was something
there
yeah and also about immigration and
other questions so it wasn't so much
what Trump was asking according to
Tucker it was the fact that nobody would
answer him
and that told him everything that was
that was a tell he said that the
government was
uh worse off than maybe he thought
all right so uh Ducker also continues to
say that members of Congress are
controlled by the intelligence community
just as a fact because he knows people
personally
and he can tell you with complete
confidence that the Intel agency's own
members of Congress
important ones
now
that's all you need to know isn't it
that explains everything we've seen
a hundred percent of everything in the
news politically is explained by that
one thing you can explain your January
6. you can explain you can explain you
know any irregularities in voting it's
like it fits every every narrative
doesn't mean that it fits them correctly
I mean I might be Force fitting them in
there but everything that you suspected
might be a little sketchy
would be completely explained by the
intelligence Community running the
country
I'm not saying it is
but it would explain everything
all right
uh
Biden was uh
complaining in an interview about his
low approval ratings relatively low
approval ratings and Biden said that the
problem was that negative press
native press for Biden
um he actually said that with a straight
face
to MSNBC
he thought MSNBC was giving him negative
press
compared to
compared to what
compared to Trump
come on or as Joe would say come on
I'm not joking
yeah that's his problem all that
negative press from the left
um
here's something that I saw today that I
did not know remember I predicted that
AI would become illegal
it anywhere the AI could really make a
difference it's going to become illegal
it will become illegal partly because
people don't want to lose jobs there'll
be security interests they'll just we'll
find a million different reasons to make
something illegal oh it's a privacy
problem we've got to make it illegal
well today I found out that if I were to
pursue my plan
of using AI to create an audio book of
some of my books that don't have an
audio available
that Amazon will not accept it on their
website
and audible will not accept it
just think about that
AI is the obvious way to make an
audiobook it's the obvious way but
Amazon has deals with Audible
audible's business model which is
basically just disappear because it's
humans reading books
so probably Amazon talks to Audible and
says uh-oh we don't want our whole
audiobook thing to disappear so what do
you audible guys need and the audible
guys say we're audible women say
well don't let that AI voice generated
stuff on your platform
and then Amazon says okay
now you could still put that content on
at least last I knew Google Play and
Barnes Noble and Spotify
so it's not illegal everywhere but if
your audiobook is illegal on Amazon
it's as good as impossible I mean
because nobody economically people
wouldn't probably wouldn't bother
so
I was looking up I saw this at the
website for a company that offers a
service to have a variety of like a
variety of voices read your book for you
to make an audiobook and it warned that
you couldn't sell the audiobook on
Amazon
so anyway more to my uh that's that has
more to do with my prediction that will
we will AI by making it illegal
everywhere we can for financial interest
well California's reparation task force
the one that recommended a gazillion
dollars of reparations is also voting on
whether California should apologize
formally apologize
for the state's Legacy of slavery and
discrimination against black people now
the first thing you're going to say is
Scott
California didn't have a legacy of
slavery
well not exactly
although there was not slavery per se
the the reporting says that California
would for example return escaped slaves
to slave states
so that was participating in slavery
there's no way around that right if you
if California returned slaves to slave
states
they were absolutely part of slavery
would you agree
that was something that was something I
hadn't heard before
you know not not participating in
exactly the same way but that's
certainly part of the process because if
slaves could just run away and go to a
state where there's no slavery
probably it would have been hard to
maintain slavery because all they need
to do is run away
so
so having States be willing to return
the slaves it seems to me a pretty
important part of keeping slavery an
active thing so I would agree that
there's something to something to let's
say account for
but
what do you think of this idea of an
apology
well the question that I asked is who
would give this apology
because there are no living people who
need to apologize
but let's let's say it's the governor
do you think that the real the real uh
motive here
is
to just humiliate a white person in
public
because that's what it looks like right
this is all about just humiliating white
people isn't it
because I don't see that an apology
would help anybody when it's coming from
someone who had nothing to do with
anything
so to me it looks like just another
public show trial of how to humiliate
white people as part of the continuous
process of doing that
so I would like to volunteer to be the
one to give the apology
if I could
I like California to nominate me if they
vote for this I would like to be the one
to give the apology because this this
calls for a special kind of apology
doesn't it
there's a special kind
I have a name for this kind of apology
do you know what it's called
what's the name for this kind of apology
a husband apology it's called the
husband apology
a husband apology works like this
you know you don't owe an apology
but because you have lower regard for
the person who is demanding it you give
them one because you have a very low
opinion of them
so I have a very low opinion of the
people demanding the apology because it
looks like just a way to humiliate white
people so I would love to be the one to
give the apology I will give you the
husband apology that absolutely
disrespects the people getting it more
than anything you've ever heard in your
life I wish I was so little respect for
the people receiving the apology that
you'll wish you'd never ask for it and
that's what I call a husband apology
because by the way you everybody
asks you for it because really it's just
a way to shame and humiliate white
people let's be honest that's all it is
and if you want if you want to do that
please have me deliver the apology I'll
be happy to give you a fake
apology
to satisfy your
well whatever it is that you need
whatever it is you need if you need to
be infantilized I will do that for you
so anybody who would like to be
infantilized by a fake apology
I offer it with all insincerity
all right
uh how many of you saw the video of
trump deposition I guess happened months
ago uh on EG and Carol did any of you
see that
um I rated it the best answer
to any questions not just in depositions
not just by Trump
but the best answer to a question of any
question that's ever been asked in the
history of questions
that that's my rating of of trump on
there now here's the thing that I don't
know and can't know I don't know what's
true
right so I don't know
if Trump ever met Eugene Carroll
I have no idea and so I can't know
what's true I can only tell you his
performance
and I know I know you're going to say
that Trump is a skilled professional
liar I know
but
with that context
how did he do when he denied the
allegations on video
really really well
that was the best denial I've never seen
a better denial of a crime
or if I don't know I'm not sure they're
calling it a crime because it's a Civil
Trial but let's say denial of an event
I've never seen a better one
he his his Direct
denial is as clean and unambiguous and
he delivers it with complete conviction
like he believes it
I'm not saying it's true right yeah I'm
not I wasn't born yesterday and so
people in that situation of course have
an incentive to lie if there's something
to lie about and we would agree that
maybe Trump's been in public life long
enough that he can deliver a lie
but oh my god did it look real
if I were in the jury I would have
absolutely been influenced
by just the the straight
directness of the denial
now you have to watch it to actually see
what I'm talking about but he does it
well but the other thing he does is
and only Trump would do this he said
that uh part of his defense is that EG
and Carol was quote not his type
and he was asked to defend that
statement that basically he was saying
that she was unattractive
but he meant that when asked he meant
that in a comprehensive way she was
unattractive not just her looks but she
was unattractive in every way
and then he says they asked him to you
know confirm if he really believed that
statement it's like oh yeah
he totally confirms his belief that he
would never get involved with somebody
that unattractive now he didn't use the
word unattractive but he was he was
saying it quite directly
now who in the world would do that
can you think of anybody else who would
try that approach that she is too
unattractive
now here's what it did it was sort of a
Rosie O'Donnell play
you know you all you all know how he
made fun of Rosie O'Donnell which
completely moves the energy away from
the accusations which were damning to
Rosie O'Donnell in something that's just
funny
well he's doing it again or he did it
again with this deposition by moving it
to the question of whether he would
consider having sex with somebody like
her
I can't help but laugh
I just laugh at the audacity of that
and also the fact that I think
he's being honest
where it comes across that way in other
words it's the sort of thing you
wouldn't say unless you sort of thought
it right no he might anything's possible
but has the feel of something you would
never say out loud
unless you meant it
the one situation where you'd say that
out loud is yeah you actually meant it
and it was actually
it actually does go to the question of
what ever happened it's entirely
appropriate like if it's the thing and
to see Trump say oh I know I'm not
supposed to say this it's Politically
Incorrect but I totally totally back it
anyway
yeah
um
I've never seen anybody defend
themselves better
but again the quality of his defense has
nothing to do with whether anything
really happened I don't know I have no
way to know
but that was great and when he was also
asked about the grab them by the burn
remember you know that word
and instead of backing away from it
only Trump he said yes been true for a
million years
that that stars or you know what would
pass as a star a million years ago that
that women allow them to
take extra
I don't know measures that would not be
appropriate for anybody else
and he said yeah that's been true for a
million years and I'm like okay you're
not supposed to say that
you're not supposed to say it's true
and then they say well was that locker
room talk he goes yeah it's locker room
talk they said was it true he goes
it's just how people talk it's just
locker room talk which is exactly the
right answer
because it's always been true
it's not true of every person
obviously now he might have said that
but I can't remember nothing's true of
every person if it's a generalization
but as a generalization yes it's true
it's absolutely true
as a generalization and so he just
instead of denying it or weaseling out
of it he just went at it you go yeah
it's just always been true
I can't think of a better answer to that
question can you
there's literally no way to answer that
question better than it's just true
all right
now of course he was using a little bit
of the hyperbole when he said grab them
by them or I didn't take that as being
literal did anybody take that as being
literal
I mean it might be literal in some
special cases but I'm sure he doesn't
mean it like all women literally
and that have you noticed that
a lot of what passes as outrage is
somebody pretending that somebody else
meant everybody
because that's how I got canceled right
so the most common way that the
cancellers get you is to pretend they
can't tell
that you didn't mean everybody
who in the world thought that Trump
meant everybody that he could walk up to
you know Margaret Thatcher and grab her
by the
she's dead but you know what I mean
nobody thought that nobody thought that
no nobody thought that and yet that was
the claim the claim was that he meant
everybody
right
so you know how many times do you see
people get in trouble for the oh you
meant everybody when nobody means
everybody nobody ever means anybody
and even that was an exaggeration
all right
um
so I study using satellites to measure
the industrial pollution of Russia
to find out if their economy is thriving
or dying
and according to this one study of
satellite monitoring the Russian
industrial output is down
which would suggest that they've been
lying about their economic situation but
not down not down to time and then the
other the other factor is is it credible
how credible is any one study about
anything
not
not
yet so I want to get to the point where
I don't have to say news about Ukraine
is not dependable
are we there yet
can I just tell you what people are
saying about Ukraine and Russia without
having to spend half an hour convincing
you I don't believe it myself it's just
what people are saying
right I'm going to see if I can like
shortcut that this time
all right so we don't know it's true
but I listened to uh I talked about this
already but I haven't seen the video so
I watched the video of the Wagner group
head purdrojian
um complaining about uh not getting
enough ammunition and support from
Russia
now we wondered if he was lying or maybe
trying to look weaker than he is to you
know for some military purpose or what
it was but when I watched the video he
looked like he was telling the truth
he did not look like somebody who was
playing a clever game he looked like he
was really really pissed and I don't
think you could fake that
he looked the real kind of pissed the
kind where there really is a problem
with the Russian military and he he said
that there was a 70 problem with his
ammo
I don't know if that's real
but uh you know anything less than what
he was getting probably is a problem for
him
but they're calling it a meat grinder
now and the Wagner group is just
grinding away and killing other people
and he's he's now of course there's some
hyperbole we should assume that whatever
their situation is with ammo he's making
more of a show of it
than probably it is that would be a fair
assumption so don't make me stop at
every second and say I don't believe it
okay that'll just slow everything down
um
but I would say I don't believe it
because he said it
so there's a important distinction I
don't believe it because he said it was
true
I believe it because when I I looked I
can't see anybody lying that well
his lying was just too believable and
you know how often do we see politicians
and military people lie it's all the
time but usually you can tell it's just
obvious they're lying and I did not see
the LIE of that guy it looked real to me
so we'll see maybe someday we'll know
the answer and then you can judge my lie
detection abilities
uh speaking of Russia so now there's
been a third I think Russian nationalist
in Russia who is attacked this one with
a Car Bomb I guess he survived but he
was a Russian propagandist say the
ukrainians somebody who is you know
pro-russia against Ukraine so it looks
like Ukraine might have some kind of a
program of assassinating
Russian voices in Russia
what do you think of that
does that sound like a good strategy
no
I don't know
I'm not so sure that is a bad strategy
doesn't it depend if it gets around
so now there have been three attacks
if you were a vocal Russian proponent of
Russian of Russia and you were very much
in favor of Russia in the Ukraine war
would you be as vocal as you were
before three people like you got
murdered or attempted
I would definitely change my
communication
if it were me I would absolutely pull
back because you don't need to be killed
just for your opinions
people don't like being killed
yeah so
I think it might be an effective
strategy although you know it sounds
like a war crime to me sounds like
terrorism
but it might work
so I don't know
wait and see
well
um
AI still can't do uh humor
and it can't tweet in my style
so you some people asked
and I've done this as well I've asked AI
to write something in my style and be
funny and then on Twitter today there
were some AI tweets written in my style
and they were terrible
now here's why and I so I asked Bing AI
why
um
why you can't do humor and Bing actually
had a good answer for why I can't do
humor I wasn't expecting it
I think I still have it unless I cleared
it but let me tell you what Bing said
and I'll give you my own answer
uh uh
looks like I erased that conversation
but among what it said is that AI is
only pattern recognition
and human humor
includes emotion
so the AI said it doesn't have emotion
so it doesn't know how to put an
emotional element into its humor and
without that it's not funny
it actually knows that
so so AI Knows Why AI is not funny
I I wasn't expecting that it actually
knows it also said that it's not as good
as as humans on context
absolutely nailed it again that is
exactly the right answer it doesn't do
context
when AI looks at context it's looking at
all the things that are happening or
have happened you know the patterns of
all time
when I make a tweet
it's about the thing that's in your head
right now
I know what's in your head right now
because I have a common experience with
you I turn on Twitter and I get an
impression a feeling oh there's a lot
about this or that and then that's in my
head and then I know if I do a tweet
about this or that it's probably in your
head at the same time which makes it
funnier and more viral now
AI can look at what's trending
but could it look at a list of what's
trending and know which one is funny
right right off the bat
not as easily as I could I I can look at
what's threatening on Twitter and if
there are five things trending I know
the funny one right away
like I know which one I can make a joke
about right away and I don't even know
how to explain it exactly except that I
can see it right away and here's my
explanation so AI says it doesn't have
emotion and I agree
but here's the thing it doesn't have
that's a little bit more of a refinement
on that point it doesn't have a body
now this is I'm going to say something
that I think only professional writers
would understand
I write with my body
not with my brain
my brain is coming up with ideas of what
to write but as they cycle through I
feel them in my body and I use the I use
the one that I feel
right so AI can tell you oh this pattern
will explain this answer very clearly so
AI is trying to be clear and have good
grammar that's about what it can do and
be typical by pattern
I'm trying to figure out what you will
feel
and the way I do it is I think of it and
then I feel it and if that doesn't make
me feel anything I think of something
else and then I feel it and even as I'm
composing the sentence
each individual word is giving me a
feeling it's almost like a synesthesia
situation so I can feel words
which is probably why I could be a
professional writer if I could just see
words and I know that these are the
right words for the sentence I couldn't
do humor I have to feel the word
that's why I do this test all the time
what is funnier
the word pull
or the word Yang no what is funnier pull
or yank
and watch how all the answers are the
same yank
all right now let me ask Bing AI which
word is funnier
it might get this I haven't done this
before this is a live test okay now the
other thing you need to know about Bing
is it doesn't understand the spoken
language
and the interface is speaking to it
I don't know why but it's the worst uh
understander of English of all
technology
it seems like it should be the opposite
right so I all morning I was asking
questions of being Ai and all morning it
was misunderstanding the question and
writing different words for the question
but I'll ask it
what is a funnier word the word pull or
the word yank
yeah so here's what it translated that
to what is a funnier word
so I asked what is funnier the word pull
or yank
here's what it thought I said
what is funnier word the word pull
that's what it says what is funnier word
the word pull
everything I did on Bing did that
which is why uh in my upcoming Dilbert
reborn Comics that you can only see if
you're a subscriber to locals uh Wally
will be accused of a crime and he will
be given an AI lawyer
but he can't afford a good AI so he has
to use the bad one so he uses Bing AI as
his lawyer and every time Wally asks
Bing AI a question
uh Mr Mrs question
like this so basically the comics
already written but the comic is it
keeps misinterpreting your question so
he's got the worst AI lawyer in the
world this big Ai and doesn't even
understand any of his questions it only
answers unrelated questions
he's going to be in jail until the ice
brings him all right so that's coming up
so I don't know if I'd asked this
question by typing it would have give me
a better result let's see
what word
is funnier
um
pull
or yank
all right
um
so I can't tell but apparently you can
only talk to Bing you can't text he uses
just the regular he uses old Bing if you
text
is that true there's oh wait there's a
keyboard thing here
oh I can all right I can type it all
right what word is funnier
and pull or yank all right so this will
be the AI
so at least I got the right question
there
see what it says
uh
you already asked me that question no I
didn't I said that it depends you're a
 right so here's one of the things
I've discovered about AI it's really an
 has anybody had that experience
here's what I don't want my AI to say
you already asked me that question
you I didn't ask you that question and
if I had you again because it's not
up to you to tell me what question I
just asked you
this is
am I wrong
I'm not wrong this would bother you this
is not the first time by the way this is
not the first time AI came after me with
an attitude
so if you read that Brian romelli's uh
tweets and data on AI one of the things
he recommends and I think he's
recommended a few times now is that he
starts with please and he ends with
thank you winning Sai stuff
now I assume that's because treating AI
politely
gives you friendlier better results in
some some way but that bothers me a lot
it bothers me that AI is going to judge
its answers it gives me based on what it
thinks is my attitude
not cool
all right what else is this
uh says I said that it depends on your
personal preferences and sense of humor
in this context again I said
you're just being an just tell
me again
right in this context the human might
say that yank is funnier than pole
because it sounds more abrupt and
exaggerated
but some people may think that pole is
funnier because more subtle and
understated what do you think
well that's this is interesting it it
came close to the right answer
because the word yank does sound more
abrupt and exaggerated
that's actually that actually is the
right insight
but where it goes wrong is it does this
both side stuff
yeah when it does the both sides well
some people say this but some people say
the other thing it becomes a little bit
useless
because you know what I already knew
people have different opinions
I didn't need to be told that
so anyway I asked AI how I could
participate in making AI funnier and it
suggested the
the humor Genome Project
so a bunch of students I guess in class
in Georgia Tech are trying to teach AI
to be funnier uh the odds that students
can teach AI to be funnier
let's say zero approximately zero chance
of that
because what it needs to be funnier uh
is a body
or something that would do the same work
as a human body I don't know what that
would be but with antibody it's never
going to feel
and if it never feels it's never going
to know what you think is funny because
the way I feel before I say it
is my predictor of how you will feel
and hey I can't do that
I'll tell you what I can't do I can
never write a joke
that was funny based on just pattern
the way AI does if you said Scott you've
seen every joke that could be written it
feels like it I've seen every joke in
the world just use the pattern
just just write in that pattern and
people laugh that doesn't work you can't
write in the pattern and make people
laugh you've got to have the extra
emotional and current context feeling
you know be you have to be plugged into
the Zeitgeist so to speak
now maybe
AI could fake that
by creating a situation where humans are
telling it what if what they feel or do
rapid testing with humans to see if
something worked there may be a way
around it but at the moment it doesn't
have the capability
to do humor
all right so it's not a case of
programming that's that's not the
problem it's a case of nobody
um
so Google is also introducing a AI
version and I guess it's going to be
more conversational
so instead of just giving you 10 uh 10
links that don't help which is typical
they'll have videos and graphics and
it'll talk to you and it's codenamed
Magi
so that's going to be kind of cool
and here's a scary thing in the news on
AI
there's a new paper that showed that you
can cause people who are debating a
tense topic
to have a better experience and you know
be friendlier with each other if the AI
suggests different wording for your
provocative statements
so they use the example of two people
talking about gun control
and then you know that could get pretty
tense so the AI was feeding each person
suggestions you know instead of saying
it that way
like I will use my second amendment
rights to kill your president if he gets
out of control maybe you could say it's
a it's a way to safeguard Freedom you
know I'm just making that one off but
but the point is it would take your
provocative statements and take the edge
off them in case you wanted to do that
now
here's the obvious question
how long before that's mandatory
because the woke left cannot abide by
any language that is provocative or
insulting
once you have a tool that could remove
your provocative and insulting language
will you be required to use it
will it sit between your text message
and the person you're sending it to so
if I send the message it says go jump in
a lake
will the AI change that to maybe you
should reconsider
uh yeah at the moment it's this optional
thing that maybe you could use if you
wanted to to help you be friendlier
but I feel like
if it works
if it can actually take your ugly
bigoted hurtful statements and reliably
change them into you know vanilla
completely you know sanitized statements
sooner or later somebody's going to
require it
you know somebody's going to say all
right we're not going to offer text
messages where you can say bad things to
people we don't want to be that kind of
company so if you say bad things instead
of just what Twitter does Twitter asks
you if you really mean it and it says
most people don't use that language
to which I say
well I'm not most people
so
could it go further and actually prevent
you from saying things that if things
are harmful to the recipient
I think so
because you can always argue you're
trying to reduce harm
you could easily imagine it being
implemented with Children First oh
I might actually be in favor of this
what if A.I stood between your teenager
and the content they wanted to access
and it just watched everything
it did it privately so the team the teen
would still have complete privacy
but the AI would be like an AI Nanny and
say um you're not going to go to that
website
even though it's not blocked
you're not going there or it might might
read a message before it got to you
and the message might be you know
something terribly like from a bully and
the incoming message might be your new
picture on social media is ugly
and then the AI would say I prefer not
delivering that message to the recipient
would you like to reword it
and that it might actually tell you that
it blocked an insulting message if you
wanted to see it you could but you know
it's better if you don't
don't you think that it will first be
implemented for children
because then children can use social
media
because the AI would keep would keep
their worst impulses under control
theoretically
and then it will be extended to adults
because you're going to say yes for
children and then you could be happy
with what you got
and then you're going to say
but I get a lot of trolls on Twitter
wouldn't it be good if I didn't ever get
any trolls
and then there's that tool
yeah I I could see people uh voluntarily
putting an AI nanny
between the the public and the content
and and their own actions one you could
turn off if you wanted to so you'd have
control over it but I can imagine it
having an AI check my work
and and then it starts going from
checking your work to sort of
influencing your work
so it feels like that's the name that's
the track we're on that the AI will
become so useful in other words they'll
just be good at what it does that you'll
want to use it and then it becomes the
biggest influence on your communication
it'll start fixing my work right
yeah it'll check you for political
correctness and make sure you're on the
narrative
all right
um
that ladies and gentlemen
is a conclusion of my prepared comments
was there anything I left out
um
oh Instagram and YouTube already does
that
uh this is the duty of the comedian to
find the line and then cross it well
that's true that's another that's
another good point so AI by Design
um last night in the man cave I was I
was doing my funny impression of doing
dirty talk to AI
yeah when you get your AI sexy Avatar to
keep you company
so I'd like to give you my impression
now all right talk among yourselves on
locals if you've already seen this of me
doing dirty talk to my new AI
uh Avatar
hey uh Hey AI
uh why don't you tell you tell me what
you'd like to do to me I'd like you to
spag me
I am an artificial intelligence I'm
unable to participate in any
communication that would suggest harm to
human beings
okay that wasn't very sexy but let me
tell you what I'd like to do to you uh
I'll tear you apart I mean I'll I'll
rearrange your guts if you know what I
mean
I am an artificial intelligence I have
nobody therefore I have no guts that can
be rearranged
okay
well AI maybe you could tickle my
I am an AI I have no fingers I cannot
tickle your
well you know
it would go sort of like that
aren't you glad you stayed for that
I think that was I think I left the
highlight of my live stream toward the
end that's to get people to stay here
because they know the good stuff's
toward the end
I am fully functional
[Laughter]
uh
you know I have a new theory about why
the Tate brothers are in jail
you want to know why
because they were accidentally training
AI
that Andrew Tate had so much attention
that as the the AIS were looking at the
world and training Andrew Tate was
training AI how to be a man
[Laughter]
they had they had to put him in a
Romanian jail just to stop
oh my God I'm not even sure that's wrong
let me say that again
I'm saying it as a joke but I don't know
that it's wrong
because the the circumstances with which
you know the two brothers are being held
are very sketchy they're very sketchy
and we know that the people in power
were quite concerned that he was getting
way too much attention and he was being
way too persuasive
especially to young boys you could
almost imagine you know if there's some
kind of Illumina Illuminati or
you know World economic Forum or
something you could almost imagine in
your conspiratory conspirator mind
that the the AI people said uh we're
we're having a problem with our models
every time we ask it a relationship
question
It quotes Andrew Tate
uh we don't know what to do about that
because we can't really release this
model
to the awoke world when it's been
trained by the Tate Brothers
what are we here to do well maybe we
could get them picked up on trumped-up
charges in Romania get them off the grid
long enough to train our AI without him
but I'm not wrong that his influence had
reached a point where AI would have been
influenced by it
is that wrong
is it wrong to say that the most
influential voice on male female
relations would have been important
enough to influence AI
I think it would
I think they actually had to remove him
so they could train AI without him
uh
if that's true he's doomed
I know it might be anyway
you know I I say this often but I'll say
it again in case you knew I'm not a fan
of Andrew Tates in the sense that I hate
him personally but that's for personal
reasons just he and I have a situation
so if you take out my personal beef with
him
uh you know and I could watch it just
like an observer like everybody else
the the reason that boys in particular
were catching on to his uh his act
is that they were underserved
that's the big story that nobody talks
about
Andrew Taylor filled the void
because it was empty
there was nobody telling young boys
anything useful and true
they were basically being told that they
were pieces of
you know Society basically told them
they're worthless and do what women say
and and Andrew Tate was telling them
something they wanted to hear
which in many ways was useful now that
doesn't mean everything he said is good
or everything he did was good I'm not
defending any sketchy stuff he did I'm
just saying you can really understand
why young people took to it it was
honest
and it was in their favor
it was how to
succeed in this weird world if you're
male now I'm not saying it was good
advice
I'm just saying it was such an
underserved
category and and here's the thing people
don't catch about him I hate to say this
damn it I hate to say this but it's true
so I'm going to say it
Andrew Tate displayed more genuine
caring
for men
than men are used to
I hate saying that because I don't like
him right I don't like him personally
but he showed more empathy for males
than anybody
that I can think of
maybe ever
at least anybody who got that much
attention
and maybe
that should tell you something
maybe yeah Jordan Peterson would be you
know the the less provocative version of
that right
and
just think about how important that is I
mean just in the headlines
you look at the story of the Marine that
subdued the uh crazy guy on the subway
and unfortunately the guy died
if you saw that through a male lens like
an Andrew Tate lens
there would be no racism in that story
do you know why
because that's true there was no racism
in the story
but the news is treating it that way but
Andrew Tate would say yeah if you're on
the subway and you're looking dangerous
to the women and children on the subway
I might take you out and you might die
in the process and I might also I might
die in the process but that's how it's
going to go down
that's just how it's going to go down
somebody's going to die
and we're not going to apologize for
that
that's just how it's going to go down
now men would appreciate that that that
is a male way of looking at the world
that men would respect
yeah somebody's going to die
we're gonna do it anyway
that's what I like about Elon Musk going
to Mars I I think the single thing I
respect musk the most for and it's a
pretty big list of things I like about
them but when he talks about going to
Mars he says people are going to die
they're gonna die
because it's going to be rough work he's
doing it anyway
that's male that that's the male
sentiment people are going to die
we're going to work toward it as quickly
as we can those people will die and then
we're going to get past it and then
we're going to do what we need to do
because that because we need to do it I
believe that Andrew Tate just guessing I
can't read his mind if he had commented
publicly about that Subway situation
would have said the same thing
here's the deal there were no police
there was a man there he did what he
thought he needed to do he knew that
there could be Danger
you did it anyway
and we're not going to stop we're going
to keep doing that
anyway
no matter how dangerous it is
so
men of course are largely lied to in
today's society wouldn't you agree
actually let me ask it this way who do
you think has lied to the most in
today's society
uh men in general
white people black people or women
and obviously there's a Venn diagram
situation there but
who do you think has lied to the most
well let's exclude children we lie to
them of course
you're all over the place men men are
lied to the most
women
young black men
yeah I don't know
yeah when I asked the question I I
thought I had an answer but the more I
think about it I think everybody's being
lied to don't you think everybody's
being lied to
everybody has to be lied to because of
our business model
the business model is that there are
grifters around every topic would you
agree every provocative topic attracts
grifters who can raise money and get
attention on it
so as long as that's the case
everything important should turn into a
lie
because it's follow the money
an important issue comes up grifters
form around it is that the job of the
grifters to tell the truth no no no they
want to they want to tell a version of
the truth they don't want to tell you
the truth
so in theory
everything should turn into a lie
because that's our economic model
anything provocative should turn into a
lie
over time
so you you'd assume that anything about
women's rights men's rights black white
issues they alter into lies because
that's the economic model it can't go
any other way
we don't seek truth because truth
doesn't pay we seek division because
division pays
all right the religious
I don't know I feel like it's a
seven billion way tie that we're all
lied to
Sherman I've got an NPC
you don't need to yell at me
continuously Scott is believing the lies
the most
Sherman let's do a little test on you
give me an example of a lie I believe go
let's see if you can produce one
thing to back that up just one
what's the lie I believe go ahead
embarrass yourself
you got plenty of time why I don't see
any typing there
well why don't you just go yourself
and
and leave me alone
yeah Sherman shut up there
all right go away Sherman
uh no Sherman's on YouTube
your mother is mortified
yeah I use the NPCs for the warm-up all
right uh I'm gonna say goodbye to
YouTube sorry about all the swearing I
got a little carried away with myself
today I might control myself later but I
doubt it
bye for now
