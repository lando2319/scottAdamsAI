good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of your life it's
called the coffee with scott adams many
of you have experienced these heights
but for those of you who have not
climbed the mountain of the simultaneous
sip well this will be new and awesome
experience for you and all you need is a
cover mugger glass to take your jealous
style a canteen jugger plastic vessel of
any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better
it's called the
what is it the simultaneous sep yeah and
it's an unparalleled pleasure really
dopamine today here it comes go
get your inner uh kitten going there
all right
well uh elon
musk is uh continues to be serious he
says by tweet
about uh building his own social media
platform
uh maybe with open algorithms and more
free speech
so he tweeted that he is serious about
that
but do you imagine that he would build
one instead of buy one
why would you build one
when you could
far more easily buy one i think
i don't know
so i wonder if he's on a shopping trip
or a building trip we'll see
if he bought one he'd have to change it
so we'll see
well did everybody hear about the oscars
last night
huh did anybody hear about that
well there was a little drama because uh
chris rock was hosting and
made a joke
uh about jada pinkett smith's
hair
you know she her head is uh bald
and uh
maybe somebody could do a fact check on
me does anybody know if chris rock was
aware
that she has alopecia a physical
condition where you lose your hair
does anybody know if chris rock can do
that you should have right because that
was public
you didn't know
but
did anybody know yeah i didn't i haven't
seen that that seems rather important
doesn't it
okay
well if you didn't know alopecia is a
condition some people have in which they
lose all of their hair
so not just the hair in their head but
basically you know eyebrows
everything else
and let me tell you
if you have this condition alopecia
or
any other physical condition
any other physical condition
do you like it when people make jokes at
your expense
now here's something not all of you know
and it's important context for this
story
jokes are jokes right
you don't get mad at a joke you don't
punch somebody over a joke am i right
would everybody agree with that that you
do not resort to physical violence
over a freaking joke
we're all on the same page with that
right
i think so right jokes are jokes you
don't punch people for jokes
now what do you do when somebody makes
fun of your wife's physical condition
and humiliates her in public
now answer that question
separate question what do you do
if somebody publicly humiliates your
wife for her physical condition she
can't change
in public while she's sitting there
is that a joke
so here's the question was that a joke
well he laughed
because when you get pointed out you
laugh typically i mean you would laugh
just for being pointed out even if you
didn't think it was funny you know so he
was he was sort of the topic so he just
you know
he uh he had a first reaction
then he saw her reaction
because i have to admit when i first
heard the joke i'd like process a little
bit i was like what what's that about oh
the hair
is she in a new movie that i thought was
there a new movie i don't know about
gi jane 2 or something so it took me a
while to process the joke maybe it took
might have taken will smith a beat as
well
now here's here's something that a
professional humorist knows
something i know
somebody told me i didn't understand
jokes today
on twitter
i calculated that i have written
something in the neighborhood of twelve
thousand professional jokes
meaning i got paid for it
twelve 000.
i know what a joke is
i kind of do it for a living
really
now
here's a rule
for humor
did you know that all humorists get
canceled if they make fun of somebody's
health condition that they can't change
did you know that you can still get away
with
and i'm not sure you should
but you can still get away with mocking
people for things that maybe they could
change such as weight
i'm not so sure people can change weight
that's a question about free will and
and addiction and all kinds of things so
that's a sort of a philosophical
question but that's that's the only
gray area
let me tell you what's not a gray area
mocking somebody for a physical
condition they can't change
how many people here and i'm actually
genuinely curious so i'm not
i'm not playing you this is genuinely
curious how many of you think that a
joke about somebody's physical health
that they can't change
should be
let's say socially allowable under the
uh under the condition that's just a
joke
how many of you would be okay with that
as just a joke physical condition
some of you would be yeah under the
under the guise of free speech now oh
hold on
yeah now i suppose it also depends
okay now is making fun of somebody's
physical condition when they're in the
room
the same as making fun of it when
they're not in a room
not really
it's not really the same i mean they're
you could they're the same in some ways
alright so i see there's great
disagreement here but let me tell you
despite your your uh your belief of what
should be
let me explain to you from the
perspective of a professional
humorist
that would be me
let me let me tell you what the rule is
if you make fun of somebody's physical
condition that they can't change
there's going to be some severe pushback
did everybody know that
how many of you knew that every time no
exception
if you publicly make fun of any groups
or person's
physical condition that they can't
change
there will be severe pushback every time
how many knew that
every time there's no exception to that
now how do professional humorists learn
not to make the mistake that chris rock
made now he might not have known it was
a physical condition so that's that's a
separate question
every humorist knows that
every everybody who's worked for a while
knows you just don't do that and if you
do you're going to pay for it and you're
not going to be happy about it
there's nobody who thinks the joke is
worth it
if you do it for a living
that kind of joke never worth it no
matter how funny it is
now the other thing that chris rock got
wrong and he really got this wrong
and this is this is a hard rule of humor
the funnier the joke
the more you can get away with
would you agree
the funnier the joke the less people are
going to be offended because then they
really see the joke part
if the joke is weak
then the offensive part looks bigger
than the joke
that's what he did
so rock made the mistake of having a bad
joke
about the worst thing you could joke
about a physical condition while the
person's right in the audience
it's pretty bad
now
how many of you would recognize the
following quote
right this is something that somebody
said see if you can identify who said it
the quote is uh oh there's a reason
you're just not supposed to do it
oh there's a reason
you're just not supposed to do it who
said that
that's what chris rock said
in a stand-up uh special
about hitting women
that's what he said he said he said that
uh
when men hear women everybody says
you're not supposed to do it
and then chris rock jokes
oh there's a reason
you're just not supposed to do it
they say there's no reason to do it so
keep in mind
that chris rock has a little history
about
uh thinking that there might be some
places that
somebody deserves to get hit
i mean he said that in public there are
situations in which you deserve to be
hit but you shouldn't be
so he's not in favor of violence let me
be clear
he just thinks there might be a
situation where maybe you should be
um
i think this this question was really a
uh
like a rorschach somebody on twitter
said this a rorschach test about the
viewer
you know the whole will smith thing
is really about you
isn't it it's almost not even about them
it's about how you processed it
i'll tell you how i processed it but i'm
not going to try to impose my
opinion of this event on you
would we all agree there's no reason to
impose my opinion about this on you but
i'll tell you what it is
i have a public opinion and a private
opinion
my public opinion is this
this is no call for violence
there's no excuse for violence in this
situation everybody good
everybody good
that's my public opinion
publicly
violence is disavowed
i think you're all comfortable with that
now let me give you my private opinion
i'm completely happy with it
completely happy
here's what i saw
number one the question was it a real
slap i think 100 yes
now
i looked at the situation i looked at
the reactions of the people
yeah that was real
so if you think it wasn't real
you're in a whole different world than i
am
i suppose anything could be fake but i
don't see it that looked as real as
anything could look
number two
it was a slap not a punch
can i explain things to the maybe the
female viewers here something that the
men can understand a little bit better
if you punch a man you're trying to hurt
him
am i right if you punch a man in the
face you're trying to hurt him
if you slap a man in the face especially
in front of other people
you're trying to humiliate him
am i right
that if you could read
smith's intention
he wasn't trying to hurt him he was
trying to humiliate him
now is it fair
to humiliate somebody
in response to someone humiliating your
wife
not only in public in front of the world
but in front of all of her
peers if you said no
i would i would respect your opinion
but if you said yes
i would also respect your opinion
can i do that can i respect both
opinions
i think i can
because you know they both are based on
reason
to say there should never be a good
reason for violence that's a that's a
good philosophical stand
but
what did you and your spouse say about
it in private
i'll bet your spouse said something like
good
and then a lot of you said in private
yeah good
didn't you now if you process this as a
punch
then i think i think it would be
reasonable to have a different opinion
if you processed it as him giving
humiliation for humiliation
and you understand that rock
crossed the line
for humor
right there there is a well-defined
social box
for humor
and
chris rock went outside it now i don't
object to people going outside the box
that's not the problem because humorists
go outside the box they test things they
get they get slapped they go back right
there so you should have some kind of
creative tension at the corners that's
okay
but the only way the whole system works
is if will as if will smith
slaps chris rock in public
let me tell you something that jordan
peterson said a while ago and i hope i'm
getting this right can somebody do me a
fact check on this because i'm not 100
right
that i'm going to represent his opinion
because when you represent the opinions
of people who are smarter than you are
it's pretty hard
because they usually have a little
nuance that you're not catching on to
but
i believe that jordan peterson has some
i said something roughly like this
that the implied violence of men implied
violence you know the
the risk of it is the only thing or
important element of keeping
civilization together
you couldn't have a civilization
without the continuous ever present risk
of male violence
and it's one of those things that you
don't think about too much
but when he says it you go you know
there isn't anything that would work
without the ever-present continuous
threat of male violence
here's a little uh parlor trick for you
next time you're in a car
and let's say you're not driving and
somebody tailgates you
pulls right up to your bumper
and it's not really a situation where
that's called for you know in some
situations you can see white people be
in a hurry or whatever but it's not
called for it's just pure
um
it's just pure tailgating
now ask yourself what is the likelihood
that the tailgater is male or female
answer the question in the so that's all
you know somebody's tailgating you
there doesn't seem to be a reason
is the driver male or female
interesting you have different opinions
the answer is female
at least around here and maybe it may be
a difference by area
but where i am
tailgaters are mostly female do you know
why
do you know why
because if a man tailgates me
i'm gonna him up
maybe
you don't know
there's an implied risk of male violence
have i ever done anything a little bit
violent
because somebody tailgated me
yes yes i have
i i have resorted to violence
the threat of violence
when somebody tailgated me more than
once actually several times
i'll tell you how i do it
if somebody tailgates me and they go a
little bit too far
i pull over immediately
and as soon as they go by i pull back in
and i pull right up to their bumper and
i stay there
until they get off the road i have
literally driven people off the road for
tailgating me
several times actually
now it's not actual violence it's the
threat of violence
and let me tell you if a woman tailgates
you
and you get off the road and tailgate
her in return she doesn't like it at all
i'm not going to follow him home but
they get off the road
do they learn their lesson i don't know
somebody says it's not wise you're right
you're right is it smart
absolutely not
do i recommend doing what i did
absolutely not
it's maybe one of the dumbest things you
could ever do
but
it's also what keeps the civilization
together
the implied violence of men is the only
reason anybody does anything they're
supposed to do
it's the only reason otherwise everybody
would just do what they could get away
with period
right the reason that a woman is safe
walking anywhere
is because men will go kill you if you
 with her
you don't know who but a man will show
up
it's going to happen right
so here's my take on will smith will
smith kept the system running
will smith acted the way the system
wants him to act not you know i'm not
saying violence is good
this is going to be a nuances heart may
be hard to explain
violence is not good i don't i don't
support it at all
the threat of male violence when people
leave a
leave their zone of reasonableness
is very important the entire society
relies on it really
but the individual you know anecdotal
examples could be terrible i'll agree
with you on that
all right
here's what i do not predict i do not
predict that chris rock will defend his
joke
beyond today
does anybody want to take the bat now
when it when the event happened
he tried to defend his joke as being
about the movie not about the person
but of course
that was craven cowardice and
it was about the person it was not about
the movie
it was about both but it was clearly
about her as well
now
here's my prediction because chris rock
is a professional
he knows that when you cross the line
into making fun of somebody's physical
unchangeable
condition
that if you get this if you get yourself
slapped
you should not have been surprised
am i right
so here's my weird prediction i don't
think chris rock will give himself a
pass
after he processes a little bit what do
you think
scott's missing the big picture
i don't know
maybe you could tell me what the big
picture is
so uh
so let's see if that happens i think
that chris rock will offer an apology
not to uh will smith but to jada pinker
smith i think he'll offer an apology
and i think he won't defend his joke now
i'm not sure if he knew she had alopecia
so without knowing that you can't really
judge it at the same way right
that'd be very different but i think he
did because otherwise the joke didn't
make sense
i think he must have known
here's my take on will smith no matter
what
people said about condemning him or not
we are also biological creatures
and if you if you listen to what people
say
and you ignore
their biological reality you'll be very
surprised
for example
how many women
will say my god that will smith is an
animal and
he should be condemned
at the same time i'm being turned on by
him
let's be honest
how many women were turned on
by seeing this man literally slap the
 out of somebody for insulting his
wife in public
yeah you know you heard this at home
didn't you
didn't you
well then at home when nobody's
listening
your wife said you know
he just he just got a little bit sexier
to me
i'm sorry because we have two things
running we have our biological cells
which kind of liked it
your biological self liked it
your social self
the the constructed you
had to say no her violence oh no
violence
law cannot have violence
but it wasn't violence
it wasn't
uh
by the way can the men back me up on
this if the women think that was
violence let me ask just the men
men only
was that violence a slap
i didn't see it as violence
no it was humiliation
that's what it was
it was a bigger guy humiliating a
smaller guy
was it fair for will smith a bigger guy
to humiliate a smaller guy
in that situation
sure
yep yep because he was paying him back
in kind
he gave it back he gave back what he got
a little bit of humiliation in public
i was actually completely happy with it
somebody says assault is violence no
assault
by definition is not violence violence
is violence and assault is assault
so look up the definition
the definition of assault is actually
misleading it doesn't mean you hit
somebody
right
so you can assault somebody without
actually harming them in any way assault
is about the
the intention i guess that's not the
right way to say it yeah batteries
batteries when you hurt them assault is
when you're
you know getting ready to i guess i'm
not sure the best definition
all right um i don't think it matters
that will smith first laughed at it
somebody's saying
because i think that was like uh
not knowing what to do reflex or
something
maybe you saw his wife's reaction
um will smith has been called
a today because they have an open
relationship
and i don't really understand that
they have an open relationship publicly
how does that make him a
doesn't that make it just an open
relationship
am i wrong
so my take is that will smith had a good
night he not only won an oscar
he slapped a guy from humiliating
his wife which is a good look
and of course he'll be
uh he'll have to be
torn and what do you call it uh
you know he'll have to be dragged today
it wasn't open you
you don't know anything about the
personal life of celebrities so
somebody's arguing with me
about the exact timeline and
of you know who did what and was it an
open relationship you don't know
anything about their relationship
you know nothing about it
so any assumption you have about
what their dynamic was is just dumb
if there's anything you know it's all
our news is fake and celebrity celebrity
news is the fakest of the fake right
so you shouldn't make any assumption
about that
all right um
yeah then chris rock made somebody's fun
of somebody's physical condition
he made a bad joke his bad joke is the
one that will get more attention than
any good joke he's ever made
and then he got slapped
uh on national tv
i think that i think chris rock had a
worse night than will smith
agree or disagree in my opinion chris
rock had the worst night compared to
agree
i figure i get lots of disagreement yeah
agreement disagreement people are all
over the board
yeah and i'm gonna uh second a statement
here
alopecia is not funny
do you get that
it seems funny to you ha ha
somebody lost their hair and i'm not
talking about you know my normal male
pattern baldness which is not a big deal
but if
do you think that any woman
let me ask you this do you think any
woman is sort of oh it's just alopecia
it's no big deal
i have to think man or a woman really i
mean gender doesn't matter as much
but
what is that chris got publicly schooled
yes
somebody says she doesn't have it i
don't know well she said she did
all right enough about that
uh
the best tweet on this was from uh
machiavelli machiavelli's underbelly he
said the reason i knew the whole will
smith oscar slap was not a planned
liberal hoax and i haven't even seen it
is that it didn't make a republican
didn't make republicans look bad it
didn't make zelenski look like a hero
and it didn't further the racial divide
in america
oh well i guess that tells you it was
real
all right
there's a candidate in virginia i think
whose name was uh i didn't write it down
didn't write it down
i'm not sure it matters but he's got a
message
uh that says we cannot lose this
generation to the mind control poison
that has permeated our schools
now he's talking about i don't know
critical race theory and overwokeness i
guess
but i was drawn to his framing
he's calling it mind control poison
that's pretty good isn't it
it's pretty good
in terms of persuasion
uh mind control poison sounds way better
than uh we don't believe that the theory
of critical race theory should be
yeah
here's not
marxist
marxist theories is just useless as a
as a
attack
if you say to the left oh stop teaching
your marxist stuff
99.9 will say i'm not even sure what
that means
so calling somebody marxist i don't
think has any impact i've never seen
that make any dent at all
but if you say that the the school is
engaged in mind control poison
then you've got a conversation
yeah mind control poison that's pretty
good because it's visual in a way
because you imagine somebody taking
poison and luck
so so this is one of those verbal things
that creates a visual and therefore is
good persuasion
all right um
rasmussen asks this question uh i'm
summarizing the question but they asked
that people agreed with the biden
administration
did they agree
that the biden administration is making
a colossal mistake
in thinking that it can protract the war
on ukraine
bleed russia dry
topple putin and signal to china to keep
his hands off to taiwan
so in other words
does it look like
biden is doing the right thing by
doing what will extend the war as
opposed to
you know maybe making zelinski give up
easily and
fifty percent of the people agreed
that uh
that biden is making a colossal mistake
in dragging out the war
35 disagreed so they think he's doing 35
think it's a good idea to do what he's
doing
make the war last long time be costly
tell china it's not going to work in
taiwan
um
i don't know what do you think
first of all
was this always the strategy
now i've been saying since the beginning
it looks like the strategy is to bleed
russia
the way afghanistan
bled uh the soviet union
so
it does look like that is the strategy
now you can't tell because i'm not sure
that the government needs to tell you
their strategy when it comes to do with
security
you know that that's the one area where
i go i think well maybe you can lie to
us about that as long as you're doing
the job
you know if lying helps then just do the
job as well as possible because i want
to be protected but you know you can't
tell when they're doing it for your
benefit that's the problem
so
um i would say that our strategy is
to do these very things bleed russia dry
topple putin i think that's a maybe they
don't care as long as they bleed russia
dry they don't care if they topple putin
maybe it's better if he's just weakened
right
and signaled to china to keep his hands
off taiwan that thing i think we do need
so i'm going to agree that if you based
it on what it looks like
and based on what we're doing
it looks like the strategy it looks like
the strategy
is just to bleed russia
is it working
if that's the strategy is it working
it might be
you know you never know because we might
be bleeding ourselves worse than
they're bleeding
um i don't think russia is going to
collapse
it's just going to take some pain and
then it looks like probably win
so i think that from putin's perspective
it doesn't matter how many people he
loses
it only matters if he wins
and i think he can tell the story now
that
looks like it it's going to win
so
did you hear that ukraine i guess
zelinski has said that ukraine is ready
to accept
neutral
non-nuclear status
neutral means no nato no
probably no offensive weapons and no
nuclear weapons
and that's pretty much what russia was
asking for
so are you telling me that we got
dragged into a war that's going to send
the world into a depression
so that zelinski could negotiate to get
what was
really should have been the first offer
they should have been the first offer
neutrality who in the hell talked to men
of neutrality
biden right
you have to think that only america
pushed ukraine into fighting
i feel like ukraine would have just said
hey hey how about neutrality
and then russia would say oh shoot
we can't attack them if they're offering
neutrality
so
i guess afghanistan
when the soviet union was in there they
lost 15 000 dead over however many years
they were there whereas ukraine they may
have lost 15 000 already
and so the thinking is that if you lose
a war your leadership is doomed
but if you win the war it's probably not
going to matter how much it cost as long
as you win
and
i don't know i don't think i've ever
hated ukraine more than today
because i feel like ukraine
but maybe the united states forced their
hand that's very possible so maybe i
should hate the united states government
first
i say that because i think ukraine
is not engaged in a
honest fight
it feels like
there's just something going on here
that we don't fully understand and i
would imagine it has to do with american
pressure and how much control we have
over zelinski
so i don't think there are any winners
here
did you see the videos and i hope you
don't
of
ukrainians torturing russian
captives
torturing them to death
now i'm not going to explain
the specific nature of the torture
because i don't want it in your head
somebody said it was fake
didn't look fake to me but i don't know
where it came from or anything else
and
uh
it could be fake by the way we should
always be alert that no matter how real
it looks
it could be
fake um
but
to me it looks like ukrainians uh
torturing
and who knows what's true right who
knows what's true but it sort of looked
real
and
um
i don't know i i feel like you could
hate everybody in this war
i think both sides have given us
something to to hate
but i guess i guess we have some
national interest in backing one side
over the other
what if
what if biden is waiting for russia to
get rid of all the nazis
do you ever think of that because one
problem of controlling ukraine is that
they got a bunch of nazis
it's like how do you support the nazis
if you're supporting the government
what happens if russia goes in and kills
all the nazis can we support ukraine
better than probably
so one of the weird outcomes might be
that
ukrainian gets denotified
because there are actual nazis
so
if putin does that
it's definitely going to be uh a point
for him
let's see
all right
today was a slow news day is there any
story i missed that you would like a
comment on
and also uh let me mention because i
don't know if i've ever mentioned that
the ukrainian shelling of the don bass
if i have that right
are the ukrainians the good guys
i don't think there are any
it looks like all bad guys fighting but
but we have national interest perhaps in
one side winning
yeah to me it looks like all bad guys
honestly
um
so somebody's saying that what it means
to be a nazi in
uh ukraine means you're anti-russian it
doesn't mean the same thing
yeah
i don't know i mean i i understand the
point that they're fighting for a jewish
leader
in a way i mean maybe their vote maybe
they're really fighting for themselves
and they just are on the same side
but i know there's something that's not
adding up there in ukraine
like a lot of it
oh where is fauci i think fauci just
earned a vacation
i think that's all that's going on
no they really like nazis yeah i i
wouldn't imagine that they're only play
acting at being nazis
you're saying zelinski is a jew by name
only
well
i'm not sure that counts the nazis does
it
all right
um
no vax talk today i don't well the the
only vac stock is uh was it united
airlines who's dropped the vac
vaccination requirement so i think the
news on
vaccinations is just going to be that
the mandates are going to start dropping
china lockdown i don't know i'm not
hearing much about it
biden seizing wealth of the uh
yeah we've talked about that
what's this
uh it was a palm strike and not a slap
which can easily ko a man yeah but it
didn't
so
you know i i get i get the difference
so i get the difference that
um
if you slapped hard enough and the
person slapping is big enough you can do
damage but since damage was not done
we might assume that that was
that was the amount of force he meant to
use
hangman's work on mexican bridge what
is the vehicle shortage real yes if
you've tried to buy a vehicle there's
definitely a shortage
how do we know physical damage was not
done we don't know that but
there's no report of it
so it's the absence of evidence for it
is all we have
um
yeah yeah the vehicle shortage is very
real
wouldn't have slapped dwayne johnson
yeah
if smith said if the smith said walk
down it would have been well remember he
was up for an academy award
i guess that would have been more
impactful
but i think you need to go up and get
your
award
somebody's dealership is overflowing
they say
rock's jaw looked askew
well he kept talking
so it couldn't have been that better
look up our gervais reaction ricky
gervais
what did ricky's your face say
i'm sure it was funny i will look up
that
um
when are you starting your stories well
i'll do that
for my evening broadcast
turns out i have a lot of stories
boy do i have a lot of stories
you should hear the stories i can't tell
you
if you think the stories i tell you are
good just imagine the stuff i don't tell
you
coffee okay that's funny
c-o-u-g-h-y
[Music]
okay that's that's good that's good
coffee
uh locals are youtuber both when i do
the evening shows i only do those on
locals
because the content is let's say not as
youtube friendly
as it could be
uh we'd be having a different
conversation if will smith were white
true
true enough
are you ruling out chris rock being in
on it yes i am ruling that out
um in fact if he were in on it and he
allowed him to hit himself hit him that
hard
oh somebody says what if jada did the
slap
now
i well i still would have been in favor
of it i guess
but i don't know it's better if a man
did it
oh gina carano has been brought back for
mandalorian season four
really interesting
mike tyson said
social media made you all way too
comfortable with disrespecting people
and not getting punched in the face for
it
oh there we go
so that's mike tyson
basically agreeing with uh
jordan peterson
did you ever think you'd see that in one
day i mean why not i mean there's no
reason he wouldn't but but the uh the
mike tyson version of it is like the
uh let's say the street version of what
jordan peterson is saying
the implied risk of male violence is the
only thing holding society together
and that's basically what tyson is
saying
in his uh in his tyson way
does robin givens have a statement to
make what
watch the ricky gervase and then do a
report all right i will
uh oh jordan peterson says there's no
cost for rudeness and disrespect well
yes
switchblades are you talking about the
drones the switchblades
how many of you let me ask you this
question how many of you think that the
ukrainians are using some
maybe not widespread but some technology
that we're not hearing reported about
and that it's working
probably probably some
even if the even if it's just
communication or something
yeah it seems likely
um we'll find out about that
all right
a switch way a switchblade is like a
hand grenade that you could throw for
miles
what does the cartoonist think about
tesla stock
uh well
here's what i think
i own tesla stock first of all so full
disclosure i own tesla stock
and i bought it when i heard
the following
um i heard this from adam
scrabble
that tesla is a
an energy play not a car play
and when i heard that i was like oh
shoot
it is it's an energy play and it's the
probably the energy source you know
especially the battery part i think the
battery part and then the solar part
will be gigantic
so
to me it's not about how many cars they
sold
it's about whether he's created an
environment
which makes the battery business
make sense
and does
um
oh
here's the
ricky gervais all right i'll look it up
ukraine is texting russian soldiers to
ask them to surrender
elon has coveted again really
how here's a question for you how in the
world have i not gotten covert
how many of you have never gotten coded
i feel like everybody got it but me
yeah okay a lot of people never got it i
mean statistically
i should be seeing lots of people yeah
now yet makes me wonder um if the
if there's something about me
or is something about the virus
and me
do you think it's just a lack of
exposure
now you know
but i but i i've had enough exposure
since omicron i definitely would have
been exposed to omicron
like you know omicrons everywhere so how
did i not get omicron at least i mean i
understand how i didn't get the first
version i stayed home
yeah yeah i think maybe cannabis is
protective i actually wonder that
all right look let me let me ask a new
question
this is a very specific question
is there anybody here
who's a chronic meaning every day
smoker of cannabis let's say a legal
user
is there anybody who smokes pot every
day and also got coveted
no hold on and also got covered two
things you've got to be
uh okay i got some guesses
lots of yeses okay
i would consider that question uh asked
and answered
yeah okay so it is not protective
anecdotally i mean it's not a research
study but anecdotally there are lots of
people who have
smoked all day and got covered
okay
huh
you're a bit of a recluse well i'm more
of a recluse than most but
certainly every member every person i
talk every person i
deal with
has been exposed to it
somehow
all right that is all
do you know i know i haven't had my
antibodies tested so that's a good point
i i might have had it and don't know
about it that is totally possible
all right that's it for today
bye bye youtube i'll see you tomorrow
