morning it's time for coffee with scott
adams
once again the best part of your day it
never fails
and is everybody ready are you prepared
because you don't want to go into this
without preparation that would be
insanity because all you need is a cup
or a mugger glass a tanker tells us time
to canteen drink a flesh vessel again
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
well everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
who says i have the worst theme song
ever
so cruel you're so cruel
well here's my favorite story of the day
a saudi prince
had 80 falcons that he wanted to
relocate
or possibly take on vacation the story's
a little unclear
but he bought airplane seats for all
80 of his falcons now of course they
were
tied to little little stands so the
falcons couldn't fly around inside the
plane
but here's a question i ask
suppose the plane lost its engines
but the falcons feeling that the plane
was going down
all started flapping in unison
could they lift the plane no
of course not not only because they're
not strong enough
but they're inside the plane and so all
of their actions would be confined
to inside so it wouldn't really work but
do you know how jokes work yeah
this isn't about the joke it's about the
mechanism for a joke
here's what makes a joke funny something
that your brain
feels makes sense
but also knows it doesn't that's a joke
a joke when when there's something about
this situation that
sort of kind of makes sense but the rest
of your brain says no it doesn't no it
doesn't
but you can't get it out of your head
the two of them live there at the same
time and that causes a little reflex
called laugh here's uh
here's a better joke about that uh rocky
manichani
who was uh that little bp here
whenever i'm doing this there's
literally one bird
that walks in front of my same security
camera every day when i'm here
it's the same damn bird i don't know
what he's doing there every day
um but rocky uh manichetti
her uh tweeted about my story about the
80 falcons in the plane and he said
imagine being a bird that died in a
plane crash
that would be the worst way to go if you
were a bird
you know if i were not inside this plane
things would be going pretty pretty well
for me that's
larry david saying pretty pretty well
so i'll just start with that
meanwhile in the law of unintended
consequences
is that roly-poly i need a i need a
sting for that too
the law of unintended consequences
um so megan rapineau
wanted to show her concern
for people in this country who are less
fortunate and or in worse circumstance
and so she has become sort of the the
face of the
professional kneelers the people who are
kneeling
when the anthem is played or the flag is
shown
and the of course her intention
i can't read her mind but it seems that
her intention was to make the world a
better place
to make it uh more fair
i'm seeing a funny picture of megan
rapidow conflated with
joe biden's face that's pretty funny
and she intended to make the world a
little bit kinder
a little bit nicer here's what she
actually did
nbc's prime time coverage of the tokyo
olympics
was down 49
compared to the equivalent night in
2016.
and 53 less than the 2020
12 of the 2012 london olympics
and the opening ceremonies were the
lowest viewership since 1988.
now it's not just a story that
there were fewer advertisers but
at some point the advertising is not
enough to support the event
and i think we're pretty close if not
already there so
there's a really a very real chance that
megan
rapinow legitimately intended just to
make the world a
kinder nicer place that's more welcoming
and
fair for everyone and what she did was
destroy the olympics destroyed the
olympics
so megan uh we call that an own goal
that's that's the official name for that
that's an own goal
speaking of own goals
of all the news today the the thing that
bothered me the most
was lionel messi if you don't follow
soccer
especially international soccer you may
not know who
lionel messi is but consider that soccer
is the most
i guess the most important sport in the
whole world
is that true still and he's
the best player in the biggest sport
now i'm not really a big fan of watching
soccer on tv because i think it's kind
of boring too
i love playing it was my favorite sport
as a player
but watching it now here's the thing
if you watch even the best players in
the world like the best teams play each
other
it's still kind of boring but
if lionel messi is on one of those two
teams
oh my god oh my god is it entertaining
in the same way that michael jordan was
entertaining even if he didn't watch
you didn't even have to be a basketball
fan but to watch michael jordan do
something that humans can't do
that was really entertaining same with
stephen curry
watching him he had a three-pointer from
mid mid court
like that's fun to watch because he's
not like the other players
so when you watch somebody you know your
tiger woods putting etc who are just
sort of not like other people
you know you're larry birds it's a whole
different thing so i'm a giant fan
of lionel messi even though watching
soccer is no big deal for me
but i like to watch his clips just go to
youtube and watch just a compilation
clip
of lionel messi's goals you don't have
to like soccer
to love the hell out of this because
you're watching a person
operate on a level that you just didn't
even know a person could operate
at and and of course the back story if
you don't know
is that lionel messi was always told he
was too small
literally too short to play professional
soccer
and he went from too short to play to
the best player in the world in the
biggest sport
here's the tragic part where he's lived
for 21 years
i think he was playing for barcelona he
has to leave the team
because they have financial problems and
they can't afford it
he has to take his family which has
lived
in this one place it's you know for 21
years basically
entire adult life i think his kids
raised there and everything else
and he has to leave because they have
debt
and they can't afford to pay him he
offered he offered to play for
half his pay so he didn't have to move
his family
do you know how much that gives up it
was like a difference between 1.5
million dollars per game
and 700 000. i mean still ridiculous
amount of money
but he offered to play for half they
couldn't afford him
he's got to leave i i got to tell you
that of all the stories i read today you
know the news is full of tragedies and
death and stuff i don't know why but
that bothered me the most
[Music]
here's a story that i was i a little
made a little note to myself that this
almost made me cry
but that's not true it actually made me
cry
um i saw a couple of people on twitter
today
giving me some at least partial credit
in one case for
helping somebody quit drinking
ed latimer was mentioned and as famously
a non-drinker as am i
and i have to tell you you know most of
you
know my story i've told it too many
times my stepson died of an overdose
in 2018. fentanyl um was in his system
and you know that that sort of
radicalizes you
as that has that effect and when i see
that somebody quit
an addiction because of anything i did
or said
you know even if i was just a little bit
of that you know
because people make their own choices i
don't think other people
cause you to do things i think you make
your own choices
but if i could help even a little bit
that's really meaningful to me it's
really meaningful
because it gives meaning to my stepson's
life
if if there's something that you know
his tragic ending
caused and it caused other people to
have
maybe more success in quitting their
addictions and then somebody else was
saying that
he had he had drank i won't give their
names because privacy reasons even
though they tweeted it
it's not it's not my business to tell
you their names
um another one said that as of today he
was going to stop
drinking 10 beers a day which he'd been
drinking
forever and today is the day that he's
going to stop drinking 10 beers a day
now that's pretty tough pretty tough
but i tweeted him so you can cheer him
on
uh lauren beaubert you all know lauren
she's a gun-toting new member of
congress republican and quite
interesting
quite interesting person she i did tweet
it so you'll see it
um she
she says the say she tweeted the same
people that thought lollapalooza was
just fine
meaning in terms of the covet uh are now
saying that sturgis will be a super
shredder disaster
do you think that's true do you think
the same people that thought
lollapalooza was just fine
are now saying that sturgis will be a
super spreader disaster
those people don't exist find me
somebody who said one of them was a
problem and one wasn't
find me that one person in the world who
says
that one group is a problem and one is
not that person doesn't exist
so much of our politics is about this
imaginary person
the imaginary person who's a hypocrite
doesn't exist
it's a whole political opinion about
imaginary people
why are we spending our time on
imaginary people could it be because we
don't have that many real problems
are we so far out of real problems you
literally have to make up an imaginary
person
describe them you're saying
you're saying obama yes yes i hear what
you're saying about obama and his
birthday hypocrisy
i usually don't do the hypocrisy topics
have you ever noticed that
have you noticed that even if the news
is just buzzing with the hypocrisy
topics i usually don't talk about them
because there's nothing to say
yeah you used to say this now you now
you say this now you're a liar
what else is there is there any depth to
that
would you learn anything nope
um so jim acosta went on what they call
an epic rant it's not a regular rant
it's epic it's an epic rant so jim
acosta on cnn
he went on his epic rant and
mocked desantis for desantis's
uh stand on the coronavirus and said
that
maybe we should call the next variant
the desantis variant
wow zing zing
you know who taught jim acosta this
technique who taught jim acosta
to cleverly brand people
to make their political careers less
successful who was it
i'm getting an image somebody orange
somebody that jim acosta doesn't like
that much that's right
jim acosta just became trump
he knew it was going to happen did let
me ask you this
in the time that you've known both
president trump and jim acosta
has trump in any way
become more like jim acosta i'll wait
i'll wait for your answer no no
but in the time that you've been
watching them
has jim acosta become more like trump
yes he has
talk about the ultimate revenge is
making your worst enemy
turn into you that's
that's a complete defeat that's that's
sort of uh
that's like killing somebody and
skinning them and wearing their skin as
a
as clothing that's as hard as you can be
somebody
turning them into you you can't win any
harder than that
but uh there's more to this story
why not call it the desantis variant
it's not very good is it
so you know when uh when trump does his
linguistic kill shots
like you repeat them and they're they're
kind of funny on the surface and they
they sort of like they hate you where it
hurts you know like
uh like low energy jab i mean that was
just
that was just like edward scissorhands
giving you a haircut kind of situation
and then jim's best play here is
about the dissenters variant
that's my dr evil
um how about that
the descent is very here's a little uh
linguistic trick for you things have to
sound right so this is one of the things
that trump gets right
that you don't know he's getting right
because you don't even know it's a thing
one of the things that trump gets right
is he uses words
that sound good together now you'll
never notice it
because he doesn't do it wrong if he
ever did it wrong you'd notice it
but because he never makes that mistake
he uses words that sound together
sound good when you put them together
you just don't notice how well he does
it but here's a cost of not doing it
well
the desantis variant
oh that's going to be viral it actually
was viral but only because
jim acosta said it but there's nothing
clever about that
the words desantis and
variant it doesn't they don't really fit
together do they
it's just one of these little things
that trump does perfectly all the time
and then you don't even notice it's the
thing you don't know it's a skill
because he never does it wrong but this
is obviously a skill because you
you can't imagine in any world that
trump himself
you know let's say he was on the other
side from desantis you can't imagine
that he would have come up with s
let's call the de santos variant it's
just too lame
because the words sound a little too i
don't know technical or something they
just don't have that
that populist punch but cnn's playbook
looks like this here's a thing they do
like to do
they like to identify a top gop
contender for the president
so they find out who's the most
dangerous republican
at the moment that's either trump or
desantis
would you all agree you know ted cruz
has been you know
sort of in that conversation and they
attack him but at the moment
desantis is i'd say the top contender
who's not
uh trump so they identify a top
contender and then they attack the
contender as
either being anti-science or racist they
have two arguments
and they will make those arguments no
matter what the facts
doesn't matter how many facts you have
they're just going to call you a racist
and anti-science no matter what
and then the third part is to produce an
epic
takedown get one of your hosts to do
something that's quote worthy in this
case
acosta so the cnn becomes the news
instead of the reporter of the news
that's right cnn makes themselves the
news
and then they report on it so basically
they're manufacturing news
so it's not really fake news it's more
like
manufactured news but
here's uh roly-poly user roly-poly
sent me some uh auto files
that let's see if i can play one of them
now i was trying to get a
like an introduction to my sections on
fake news so here's one
if i can play it
fake news
all right let's let's try another one
here
fake news tweet of the day i don't think
it was quite there it needs a little
work
needs a little work all right how about
this one um
this is for the desantis news
pretty good pretty good good start
thank you roly-poly um
user he's tweeting at me right now
isn't it freaky seeing uh yourself
mentioned
on on the live stream when you're
watching it and then
your name comes out so i've had this
happen to me a number of times
i'll turn on the television i'll just be
watching television and they start
talking about me
it's so freaky it's like no i'm watching
you
don't talk about me television so that
just happened to roly poly
so how many of you have heard the theory
that the therapeutics are being under
let's say under-appreciated officially
because if therapeutics existed for the
covent
legally we wouldn't be able to do an
emergency use
for some other drug if we already had a
drug that was
you know really helpful how many of you
heard that
and believe that that's true
how many of you are of the belief that
the reason we don't talk about
ivermectin
or hydroxychloroquine or now there's a
new one
a cholesterol drug cuts coronavirus
infection in a laboratory
by 70 and it's i guess it's an existing
fairly safe drug that's off the shelf so
it'd be a big deal
if it worked just like it would be a big
deal if any of the others worked
right so yeah regeneron is
isn't it regeneron approved i thought it
was
i mean as opposed to an emergency
approval
so i'm going to call fake news on that
i'm going to call that a conspiracy
theory that is not
backed up now i don't know and i'm going
to put odds on this right
so this doesn't mean i'm 100 sure
sometimes i act like i'm completely sure
what i'm not so
i'm trying to moderate that a little bit
so that i don't do that so much
here's my take on it let's say there was
a
law or a rule that said you can't get
your emergency
authorization for the vaccines if
therapeutics exist
and let's say in this scenario that
therapeutics did exist
let's say they did does that mean that
in the context
of a global pandemic
there's nothing you could do because the
the rule says
you can't authorize something for
emergency use
so you're done right you just can't do
it is that right
so you just can't do vaccines no
nothing works that way nothing works
that way
now there might be there's there's a
variant of this in which the
pharmaceutical companies are you know
bribing the government
but do you think that in the trump
administration
do you think trump took a bribe from the
pharma companies
that nobody's even suggested it right
and it would have to be trump
because he was the one beating up on the
fda to get the vaccinations through et
cetera
let me tell you this let's say there was
a rule
or a law or whatever it is i don't know
what the situation is it's either a rule
or a law
that you can't do the emergency use
thing as long as therapeutics exist
if you went to trump during the um or
any president
could be biden to you go to the
president whoever it is during a
pandemic and you say we've got this rule
that prevents us from doing this thing
that would be really really important to
do
how long does the rule stop you
it's it's over in a pandemic
that kind of rule doesn't mean anything
how many how many
rules did trump change just by signing
an executive order
did anybody question them no it's a
pandemic
i mean it's a different situation at the
moment right but during the
the worst of the pandemic we kind of
stand aside and say okay
leaders we understand this is not the
time to debate
this is the time to do something and we
know you're not going to be right every
time
like that would be unreasonable but but
do something because it's an emergency
you got to do something
under those rules there's no way that a
law
or some guideline or rule would have
stopped us from doing what made sense
so i'm going to call
on the on the idea that the reason
therapeutics are being
under undervalued by the government
is because they just had to get this
rule for the vaccinations
and maybe the farm big pharma was
pushing or bribing somebody
i'm not buying it i'm not buying it
because i don't think trump could have
been bribed
by pharma does anybody disagree with
that
does anybody think that trump
specifically trump
because he was the one there during the
time this was all happening
do you think he could have been bribed
by pharma
just i just don't see it right i just
don't see it
and and was there ever a rule that trump
didn't like breaking
i mean most of his act was tell me the
tell me the rule that's in the way and
then i'll break it
remember you couldn't do tele telehealth
having a doctor call you across state
lines and i was a little involved with
that
what did trump do he said oh here's a
law that's in the way
it's goodbye it's gone i don't believe
for a second
that trump was affected by big pharma
wanting
not to have therapeutics look good i
just don't think for a minute that
affected him
if it had been a different president
maybe maybe but i just don't see it
affecting trump
he's the guy who who just blows through
rules
he doesn't care yeah i mean trump
screwed the pharma companies during his
presidency
in a variety of ways and he did it right
in their face
so i don't think he was going to do it
because they wanted it that's for sure
here's one of those rules that i'll say
a million times because it's
so important you only manage
the things you track this is one of the
biggest deals in all of management in
fact
there's no such thing as management if
you're not tracking
because otherwise you're just flailing
around you don't know if the things you
do
are working or not working it's not
management
unless you can track oh we did this and
i got this result
so we should do more of it or less of it
based on the result
so um at this point
the way we track the covet stuff will
determine
what we do about it let me say that
again
you don't decide what to do about it and
then figure out how to track it
ideally i suppose you do it that way you
end up tracking whatever you can track
and then whatever it was that you could
track works backwards and then that's
what you managed to
which is a bad way to do business you
don't want to manage
to what you can measure because it's the
only thing you can measure
now in our case we're reporting i saw
this again california had
13 deaths yesterday from covent
allegedly
they did not report at the same time how
many of the 13
were
i just had a technical glitch on
locals platform but it's going to come
back in a second so
sorry youtube just a moment and i'll get
back to this story
i believe i can go right back to it
all right i'm back sorry locals a little
technical difficulty
uh that's the second time that's
happened um
so california reported 13 people died
yesterday of covid
but how many of them were vaccinated
don't you want to know that
like if the public is part of this
process
and should be i mean i don't think the
government should be making
decisions alone the the public opinion
and
the public feedback is part of the whole
process right that's
that's the way we run this stuff and if
the public doesn't get good information
or let's say
information that they can act on
productively
then you're not managing it's not that
you're doing it right or wrong you're
not doing it
let me say that again i'm not saying
that the government is managing covid
right or wrong
i'm saying they're not managing it
there's no stated strategy
and we're not we're not even tracking
the right stuff
because if you tracked how many people
died
who were vaccinated versus unvaccinated
that would tell you something
if the only if most of the people dying
are unvaccinated
why do i care
right in terms of you know living in
free society of course i care about
people
you know it would be individual
tragedies of course
but why would i care from a policy
perspective if these people
had access to the vaccinations chose not
to take them
got the result that you get if things go
wrong under that consideration why do i
care
i'm vaccinated i had access to it they
had access to it
as long as they have access to
vaccinations
i need to know how many died vaccinated
now
mark cuban you all know mark
tweeted at me he said scott period
you do realize that if say we got to 90
of people have vaccinated that it's
likely that around 90
of the hospitalizations and deaths would
be vaccinated
but the total number of hospitalizations
deaths would be about 90
lower than had people not been vaxxed so
he said do you realize this
yes yes yes i realize that i say it all
the time
and that doesn't change the request
to have accurate numbers right
so you all understand that if a hundred
percent of people were vaccinated
then every person who died from covet
after that point would be a vaccinated
person
and you would not conclude from that the
vaccinations don't work
you would say thank goodness it was only
five people
could have been thousands right so
mark your point is good but of course uh
i say this all the time
however if you had all of these numbers
you'd be in good shape
if you knew how many were vaccinated of
the deaths
and how many were unvaccinated and then
you also knew
you know what percentage of the country
or the state was vaccinated
you'd have everything you needed right
so yes
mark's point is good and you should all
be aware of it that's why i say it all
the time
if everybody's vaccinated then those are
the only people dying it doesn't mean
the vaccination doesn't work
so um tell me how many are unvaccinated
or don't let me
or don't imagine that i care um
cairo omega on or kira how do
you pronounce k-i-r-a kira
or kyra anyway sorry i'm mispronouncing
your name
kira but
she tweeted i'd frankly also like to see
stats for the different vaccines
administered
wouldn't you wouldn't you like to see
that
and why haven't you because it does seem
like a reasonable question
i would think that every person who gets
hospitalized with covent
should be asked are you vaccinated and
which one
and and how recently you know those are
the things we should be asking
i'm guessing we asked that but is it a
is it a
federal regulation it should be there
should be some federal regulation that
says you have to ask that and report it
now i would say that maybe there was a
reason we didn't report that before
because remember you you only get
in terms of managing you only get what
you measure
suppose we had measured that from the
start
the differences in vaccination results
what would that have done because that's
what you're measuring and what you
measure causes you to act differently
i think it would have caused fewer
vaccinations
in the beginning because there was a
availability
problem so if you could get any one of
the vaccinations you'd get it
you didn't want people shopping which is
sort of what i was doing
i was kind of shopping that's why i
waited so long i was waiting to see if
any of the vaccinations were duds
or if there's any surprises so i waited
as long as i could to get as much
information you know a few months
but at this point now that anybody can
get a vaccination
you could probably shop couldn't you
don't you think that
maybe you'd get a few more people
vaccinated if that was your goal
by telling them okay we've got different
vaccinations we did find this one's five
percent better
and maybe some people would say oh okay
i feel
i feel like you know more about the
vaccinations so
i'll give it a shot i'll give it a shot
wrong um dr eli
david not a medical doctor but another
kind of smart doctor
was tweeting there's a new peer-reviewed
paper showing the aerosols play a major
role in covet transmission
and fine aerosols constitute 85 of viral
load detected
and he says that masks can drop can
block
droplets not aerosols so it's time to
abolish all non-scientific
mask mandates to which i say
the same things i always said if you
have data
from a laboratory experiment which is
what this is i believe
and you also have laboratory from the
field or you have data from the field
which one do you look at you got two
sets of data
in the laboratory they say huh we're not
sure these masks are working
but in the real world they're working in
other words where there are masks that
can measure that there's
more of a benefit now is
any of that data accurate who knows
we're in a world where you can't trust
anything you can't trust that the masks
work you can't trust that they don't
work
you definitely can't trust a laboratory
study so here's what i would tell you
i would never look at a peer-reviewed
which is different than a randomized
controlled trial
i would never look at it just a
peer-reviewed paper that said that we
tested something in a laboratory
and found out that there's a lot of
aerosols
that matter we kind of already knew that
that the aerosols matter
and we also knew that the mass were
never intended to stop a hundred percent
of anything
they were they were they were supposed
to stop some
some amount of it during the worst of
the pandemic
now i'm anti-mass mandate
just to be clear because it sounds like
i'm being pro-masculine
but i think you can have the nuanced
opinion the masks make some difference
but overall they're not worth it because
your lifestyle would be so
affected by it so that's my my point of
view
i believe that mass almost certainly
makes some difference
let me put it this way if you knew you
were in a room with people who had
coveted
let's say you knew there was one person
in the room and you're going to talk to
all of them one by one
would you want the person who is talking
to you from three feet away and facing
you to be wearing a mask
or not yeah
right how often before the masks were a
big thing
were you talking to somebody and you
could feel their spittle in your face
you know what i'm talking about you can
feel the spindle hitting you in the face
i feel like if somebody has covet i
don't want their spittle hitting my face
and the mask would make some difference
right so i think you can be
uh scientific enough to say masks to
make a difference
at the same time you can say maybe we've
reached the point where if
unvaccinated people want to take the
chance let them do it and vaccinated
people too
so remember vaccinated people are
getting the virus now
so don't forget that
um
let's see barnes posted a link on a
randomized control trial
that should statistically give rules
that ivormectin was effective at
treating covet
interesting so um somebody's saying that
uh
uh barnes has posted a and
you can see uh viva and barnes uh their
podcast is great by the way it's one of
the best ones
you should watch on youtube and or
locals i think you can see it on both
platforms
twitch too maybe um
but this is news i haven't heard before
so i'm just seeing it in a comment on
locals
that uh there might be some new news on
ivermectin
all right um
all right is there anything i missed
i said uh viva and barnes
um i'm going to look at your comments
here for a moment
corey bush yeah i don't have much to say
about her i know what you're talking
about but
um yes there's a story about
a police officer who almost od'd on
fentanyl without taking any
was just around it and just sniffed it
that happens to
drug dogs too if a drug dog sniffs
fentanyl
dog's dead um
how did a guy like you get a girl like
christina
you know you're not the first person to
ask
but why isn't anybody asking how a girl
like christina got a great guy like me
could it be my looks could be
all right that's about all i got for
today and i will talk to you
tomorrow
