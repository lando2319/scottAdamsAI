hey everybody
i'm going to be listening to
the vote with you whoops
i wonder if you can hear me
anybody there
seven people well i'm just going to be
listening to the vote
which just died on my phone
maybe i'm not going to be listening to
it the moment i turned it on my uh
my source for this died so see if i can
get it back
you're going to have to listen to it
yourself
because i can't oh there we go
so they're they're just reading the
charges right now
the votes will be in a moment
uh i'm not going to be talking too much
just be drawing my comic
so
god lee is like a thousand years old
so
it's kind of exciting
three to four
i love how exciting this is if it's four
to four
now it's five to four
now it's five to five this couldn't be
better
do
oh guilty 12 not guilty sex
mr creepo
laughs
it's so predictable you should just ask
them what their party is
guilty
you
um
um
romney romney votes romney votes guilty
so
well nobody named scott thinks he's
guilty
there's a lot of senators i've never
heard of
food
i love that there's a senator named
white house
you
so
so
uh
well i suppose there wasn't much doubt
about where this was going
i guess it could have could have taken a
negative turn but it ended up just as
provided
just the way we thought it would uh go
now are there going to be any
be any riots because of this
you know prior to any of this i thought
that
it would be a mistake for trump to run
for reelection
but specifically because they tried to
impeach him for this
maybe he should maybe he should the
the strangest thing that we learned from
all of this
is that the uh the media is stronger
than
the president wouldn't you say we
learned that
because i would say that the media
removed the president
if they had not created the environment
that they had i
don't think he would have been removed
so
now that the most powerful person in the
country
allegedly the president has been shown
to be
less powerful than the press and the
news making part of the the business the
opinion people
what would be his best play his best
play
would be to go into competition in the
news and opinion business
because he would have more power than
that he would as president
the president has to bow to the will of
the people
who do the will of the people bow to
whoever whoever does the best job of
brainwashing
so right now the the business or the
model of our country
is that the press decides what the
policy will be
they brainwash the public and then when
the polls show that the public is on one
side or another
the politicians sort of have to follow
that or at least follow what
you know the their base wants them to do
so eddie thought that what's happening
is that uh
politicians are making decisions and
then implementing them
based on their wisdom is not exactly
what's happening
it's more like the fake news creates
opinions
they assign them to the public the
public then
forms you know a a polled opinion
that is one way or the other and then
the politician
has to follow it to get reelected
so the press is running things
would uh would trump want to take a
second position
meaning being president again when he
can have a first position
and be in the news business because
don't you feel like his odds of
succeeding
in the news business would be
close to 100 right i mean you'd have to
do something quite wrong for him to fail
in the news opinion business because he
knows everybody
you get plenty of people to show up you
know it would be interesting
he knows how to put it on a show
it could be a good move if he builds his
uh
his network now but i do love the fact
i love the fact that he still has the
option of running
just because it makes everything uh
it just makes everything more
interesting when he's at least
potentially still in the game
so i don't think he should run it would
be a mistake in my opinion
but uh it's nice that it's out there i
like that he didn't lose the right
i think that was to me that was more
important than whether he runs or not
what kind of uh what kind of network
could have tds as its initials so it's
not trump derangement syndrome uh it
would be like the trump
uh data service or something
that's right we all were acquitted we we
all who
might have been associated with
supporting trump at any time
yeah but you know you were only
acquitted by republicans
for what it's worth and then and not
even all the republicans
that was probably the impeachment trial
was maybe the most ridiculous thing i've
seen in a long time
because you know there were no no rules
of
uh behavior pure lying
uh ridiculous stuff but what was my
favorite part of the whole process
it was today when van der veen referred
to
the find people hoax as
did you hear that he actually called it
the fine people hoax
he actually used the word hoax i think
that's the first time
that the lawyers called it a hoax
and i like to think that
i might have been some small part of
bringing that to the let's say at least
branding it
and bringing it to the attention now of
course uh
most valuable players have been uh
steve cortez joel pollock greg guffeld
and and i and they and lots of others
have
done what we can to uh to tweet about
this and
boost it and so if it made a difference
i feel like i had a really good day
today i don't know about you
but it feels like a good day
and i'm not going to complain about the
fact that stocks are
up under the biden administration
i'll find plenty of other things to
complain about but
if if stocks stay high i'm not going to
complain about that
all right um
you know it it's a strange kind of
victory isn't it
i'm not sure it's a real victory but
it's the opposite of losing
at least at least if you didn't want to
be part of associating with somebody who
got impeached
and removed but impeached twice is some
kind of a record right
is that the record does trump hold the
record for
most number of impeachments while having
no removal from office i think the
democrats have made
impeachment just ridiculous now just
ridiculous
so i was saying during the trial
that once the trump defense had debunked
in front of the whole world the fine
people hoax
isn't that grounds for impeachment for
biden completely serious
all right with it without trying to like
make a point
you know without trying to make this
purely argumentative
serious question if inciting violence
is the standard for according to
democrats
a standard for impeachment if
republicans said
let's try that out and they tried to
impeach
biden for basing his campaign the moral
heart of his campaign was fighting
against the charlottesville
uh situation which we now know
i mean we knew it long long ago but
others are just learning it
was never real that the president in
fact had condemned the neo-nazis
and white nationalists in direct
language
at that time without being prompted
and until you saw the rest of the video
you didn't know that
so now the country knows it so now that
the country knows
the fine people hoax was a hoax
i feel as if it's somewhat
clearly obvious that that caused
violence
the the belief that this president
had had ever called neo-nazis fine
people
which we know now didn't happen
that had to make people more worked up
during summer riots etc it had to make
it
an effect and so i would say that in all
fairness
you
