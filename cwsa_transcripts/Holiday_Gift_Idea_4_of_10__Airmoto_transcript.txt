here's one of my favorite garage
instruments it's the Air Moto you can
just Google that and find where to buy
it and it's for uh inflating tires it'll
do uh it'll do balls tires uh bicycle
tires car tires electric bike tires and
the interface is pretty
simple um you just hold it down to turn
it on and you can set it for what kind
of device and then you have a variety
adapters for the different things you're
attaching it to and you just push a
button and walk away it charges so it's
rechargeable no batteries required and
it seems to be good for I don't know a
car tire or two um and certainly more
than enough for bicycles and balls so
good product I use it all the time
