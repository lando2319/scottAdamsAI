good morning everybody and welcome to
the 2000th
2000 coffee with Scott Adams the best
thing that's ever happened to you
obviously and could it be even better I
don't know I don't know but let's see if
we can take a run at it
if you'd like to make the 2 000th
episode extra special all you need to do
is find a cup or a Mugger a glass of
tanker jealous Diane again teen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better including all the crow I've been
eating it's called
the simultaneous step it happens now go
ah coffee and Crow
it's the best
well so here's a little update on this
is a story that just personally makes me
happy
um Robert F Kennedy Jr you know he had
some problems with his voice
and he told me on Twitter the other day
that apparently something I said or did
inspired him to look for Surgical
Solutions
and he didn't he didn't have the surgery
that I had to fix my voice
it was a different procedure one that
gets them up and running much faster
and
I just moments before I got out of here
I found a recent video
to see if his voice was better and it is
it is it's not you know fully up to
probably where he wants it but it's
absolutely better
and apparently apparently he told me
it's improving every month
so isn't that great now I could tell
he's having the problem that I had when
I first got the surgery his his with a
different procedure so there might be a
difference here but
um the first months after the surgery
I had to stop to take a breath because
I'd be exhausted just doing a few
sentences but eventually you get that
back too
so I'm quite quite happy for Robert F
Kennedy Jr
um if he's happy and I think he is it
looks like it looks like a big
Improvement I'd say about a 40
Improvement 30 or 40 percent and and
improving
all right here's a story I just saw
before I went live here
uh on Twitter a user named Jason Storm
Chaser Nelson
is a he's a veteran and apparently he's
running for congress at least once
and here's he did his own research
and here's what he found about eggs
so you probably heard that egg prices
are high because of the
avian flu and a bunch of chickens had to
be killed so supply and demand fewer
chickens Etc
but uh Jason Nelson talked to 25
families in Six States
who have egg production
25 families in Six States
and each of them is finding that their
chickens stop laying eggs at the same
time
25 different families in Six States
and all of their chickens stopped laying
eggs at the same time
and he asked and apparently they all
changed their feed at about the same
time
and he's concluding it's definitely the
feed
the problem is that there's something in
the feed this is his claim I'm I can't I
can't verify it but his claim is that
the one thing they had in common is they
changed their feed and then all the
chickens start producing eggs
do you believe that
I'm wondering what kind of vaccination
those chickens had
mRNA do you think
I think they got into the Pfizer mix no
I don't really think that I know it's
hard to tell when I'm kidding
but uh let's keep an eye on that
um generally speaking is this the
category of things that is likely to
check check out
let me do a the BS test
if you didn't know anything ever about
this story again
and then you know two weeks from now
somebody said all right you're gonna
have to Bet Your Life
whether that was true
Would You Bet Your Life this was true
I don't think I would I think I would
put a pretty big bet that is not true
but I'm keeping an eye on it I'm keeping
an eye on it because you know I don't
think he's lied I think he actually
talked to 25 families and
probably their egg production is down I
don't know that it's the feed I mean it
would be amazing
if he figured it down on the first pass
right if he just sort of looked into it
and totally figured it out that would be
amazing and I'd be very impressed and it
could be
it could be could be true
uh but I've done it against it so that's
where I'm at I bet against
by far the most interesting thing
happening in politics
by far
there's nothing even close to this but
the the mainstream media hasn't figured
it out yet there's something coming
that's really important
and you don't quite see it yet so let me
connect some dots
so you might know that Josh Hawley
introduced a bill
that will uh ban Tick Tock if it gets
passed the band ticked out in the United
States
now I don't know if it'll pass
but here's what I do know
if there's a vote on Banning tick tock
given that nobody's in favor of keeping
it nobody in government nobody there's
nobody on the side of keeping it nobody
thinks it's a good idea nobody
but there will be people voting to keep
it
right there will be people who vote to
keep it
once we have that vote no matter what
happens with Tick Tock once we have the
vote we will know for sure who the
Chinese assets are in our government
think about it
Josh Hawley invented
a Chinese asset detector
because if the issue had two sides where
you could legitimately argue maybe we
should keep it and that it would be good
for the country somehow keeping it if
that were the case it wouldn't tell you
anything because you think well they're
just voting on the issue
because there's an argument on both
sides Tick Tock is not like any other
issue ever
it's not like any other issue ever
because there's only one side
there's literally no other argument
there's no argument that says yes we
should let China have a user interface
for changing the opinions in America
nobody says that
nobody
so we have this weird unique situation
where everyone who votes against it can
be presumed
quite reasonably
to be working for China
just think about that
there will be no pushback in these
comments just watch nobody's going to
disagree with what I just said there
will be no disagreement Josh Hawley
actually invented a Chinese asset
detector
and he's about to spring it on Congress
said it anyway
is that cool
I mean seriously
this is one of the coolest things I've
ever seen
well certainly one of the most important
things I've ever seen in politics
but this will get this will get no
coverage
this will get no coverage
you know it might like who knows if they
even bring it to a bill
if I had to bet
I think it's not going to go to a vote
what do you think
I think it won't go to a vote
because nobody wants to vote on it or
there are too many people who don't want
to vote on it
yeah
so if he can get it to a vote you know
yes no vote will actually know who China
controls in our in our government
for the first time
this will be really really interesting
it doesn't even matter if it gets banned
we're going to find out either way but
only if there's a vote
so I'm gonna I'm gonna bat there won't
be a vote
does anybody want to take the other side
of that bat
well let's make it a prediction not a
bet it's not a prediction my prediction
will be no vote
because Congress can't out all their
Chinese assets they'd know it would be
too destructive
that's what I say let's see
let us see
all right
um
so at the same time that Holly is trying
to ban Tick Tock for all the right
reasons good work Josh Hawley
um Adam Schiff who got kicked off of the
Intel the Intel committee for not being
uh a reliable Patriot
the first thing he did what's the first
thing he did when he got kicked off of
the Intel committee for not being a
reliable Patriot
he made a tick tock video
to ask for funds
he made a fundraising Tick-Tock video
now combined that statement
with what we know about tick tock's heat
button they literally have a button that
they call the heat button and if they
see a meme that they want to promote
Tick Tock meaning the government of
China if they if they choose to do it
they can just push one button
and make anybody who's supposed to go
viral
now just connect these dots it was a
fundraising
post on tick tock
Schiff is raising funds to presumably
you know run for something probably
Senate people are saying in California
now what happens if China pushes the
button
if China pushes the heat button that we
know exists reporting has verified that
then shifts a post will get let's say a
thousand times more attention
what does that do for his fundraising
if a thousand more people will see it
than would normally just in the in the
way social media Works don't you think
you get a thousand times more
fundraising
I mean that might not be the biggest
dollar amount in the world
but
you tell me
if you send a fundraising video
it's not going to raise zero right do
you think he sends out a fundraising
video and raises zero probably not
so do you think that if you know 10 000
people see it he makes as much money as
if a million see it I think if a million
sees it he makes more money
which means that China
has influenced the election
all they have to do is push that heat
button and they've influenced the
election they'll get more Adam Schiff
and less whoever else
am I wrong
you tell me was any part of that not
demonstrated to be a fact they do have a
heat button he did do a video raising
money the more more people see it the
more money he makes
so if Tick Tock pushes that heat button
Adam Schiff has more chance of winning
his election true or false
that's just a statement of fact that is
demonstrably obviously and publicly true
this relied on no speculation no
speculation the only speculative part is
we don't know if they're going to push
the button
but the fact that they could
and that they built a user interface to
control American politics as well as
their minds that's now demonstrated
that's now in evidence
thanks to Adam Schiff
right now
a lot of people say bad things about
Adam Schiff but let me support him for a
moment
you know I like to take the other side
of arguments sometimes a lot of people
giving Adam Schiff a lot of trouble and
I think we should take a moment to
recognize the great value
he provides to the country
Adam Chef
is the most transparent liar we've ever
seen
when he says something's not true it is
confirmed to be true
if he says something's not true or if he
says something's true it's confirmed to
be not true now there's nobody
who has a better track record of being
completely wrong while lying about
everything important
other people maybe they lie maybe they
don't but you can't tell on the next one
the beauty of Chef is that he's so
consistent
you can actually predict
that the next thing he says will be the
opposite
right and does it matter what the next
thing is
it doesn't it doesn't even matter what
the next thing is as soon as he says X
is true you can say with complete
confidence oh at least we know X isn't
true
and that is more transparency than we've
ever had in our government
because before it's people lying or
maybe not how did you know but he's so
consistent he's like this clear Beacon
of what's true and what isn't you just
reverse what he says
now
if this sounds to you like a clever or
humorous thing based on things that are
sort of feel like things but are not
true that's not what's happening I'm
quite literally no joke
saying that he is now a reliable
indicator of what's true and false and
we've never had one
that I can think of
right
we've never had anything that was that
reliable
you know you just have to reverse it
for example
uh January 6. well let's take Russia
collusion Schiff said that uh
Republicans and Trump were were
colluding with Russia turns out it was
the FBI who were who were looking into
it we're colluding with Russia at least
one member of it and others were talking
to Russia in ways that I would call
collusion
but you might not
so Russia collusion perfect example
where Schiff was an accurate
an accurate determinant of the opposite
of what was true
about the January 6 Insurrection which
he keeps talking about
is was the January 6 event and
insurrection
because he says it was
now you know it wasn't
and and in fact it's obvious it wasn't
because
Republicans don't go unarmed to an
insurrection
I'll talk about that in a moment
and
did the January 6 Insurrection tell you
something only about Republicans
that it wasn't a real Insurrection no I
told you more
because he he lies by projection
every liar
has a tell
and by the way once you hear this for
the first time
once you start watching you'll see it
everywhere
all right some people lie only by
omission
you probably know some of those people
you might be one of those people some
people lie
but only by omission
oh who'd you go to lunch with Bob
true
but also Raquel was at lunch you just
didn't mention it
right people would lie by omission
will Lie by Omission again
and again and again
that that will be their pattern for
lying there are other people who Lie by
adding detail to stories actually
introducing characters who don't exist
oh yeah I went to lunch with Raquel and
Bob and Eric and and all the guys
and then you find out was only Raquel
right so a whole bunch of people were
added and a liar of that type would
actually tell you a story
about what one of them said at dinner
like adding real detail once you learn
that there's some people lie by adding
characters
then watch for it because they'll do it
again people lie a certain way and then
they'll always take that pattern forward
shifts Lies by projection
so if he's blaming the Republicans of
you know killing a cow
you can be fairly sure that his team
killed the cow
and you know once you see the pattern
it's unmistakable you see he lies by a
pattern
so
um
by claiming that the uh
that the Republicans were trying to take
over the country with that January 6th
Insurrection I conclude
that's an accurate sign that he believes
I'm not saying it's true
I'm saying that shift believes based on
this signal
Schiff believes that the Democrats
rigged the election
because that would be consistent with
this projection method if he believed
his side committed the crime if they did
or not I don't know I have no evidence
one way or the other but it shows that
he believes that the Democrats rigged
the election because he's blaming the
other side of trying to do an
insurrection
no it's not proof by his pattern is
consistent how about do you think he's
ever accused the Republicans of being
racist at the same time that Democrats
are pushing CRT and equity and other
other things which are unambiguously
racist of course he is right yeah he's
blaming them of racism while he's doing
racism of course he is
um if he said that Hunter's laptop is
not real
that would suggest that there's some
covering up on the side of the or or it
would suggest that the Republicans are
just making stuff up back when he said
the laptop wasn't real I didn't hear him
say it but I'm sure he did I'm sure he
said it right do I even need to do a
fact check
I have no memory of what Jeff said about
the laptop let me guess he said it was
fake
Russian disinformation right can you
give me a fact check do I even need a
fact check on that right obviously did
so because he said it was fake you know
it was real
but you often you have to go faster or
further than that
if he said it was fake
it means that they fake stuff
right in other words accusing the
Republicans of Faking a laptop
suggests that he knows his team fakes uh
fakes evidence
don't know which evidence but it would
be projection so it predicts
all right
um so look for the next thing he claims
and then you'll notice the opposite
um
project Veritas how many of you saw the
latest project Veritas of a Pfizer I
guess you'd call it the executive or
team leader or something but he seemed
to have some Authority
and here's what we saw we saw the Pfizer
person it looked like he was on a date
so this part is speculation
I'm going to guess
that the project Veritas undercover
reporter this is just a guess
is a super good looking guy who can
pretend to be gay if he needs to
do you think that's true just
speculating because I the only thing we
see in the video is the Pfizer executive
who again I don't know like I don't want
to assume his identity that would be
wrong
but we'll we just say what what it
looked like
all right so I don't know what's true
I'll just say what it looked like what
it looked like is a gay man who was very
much interested in the man he was
talking to
so interested he was willing to say
whatever that man wanted to hear
that man wanted to hear about Pfizer's
vaccination program
as one does on a date
so the poor gentleman who was suckered
in was trying very hard to impress a man
who I assume
is probably ridiculously good looking
like if you just looked at the face of
the guy
this guy was a love it looked like they
just met so he was definitely
he was definitely interested in the
other man
that's what it looked like all right now
if it turns out later he says he doesn't
identify as gay or bisexual then I'll
take his word for it but
that's what it looked like
now
the thing that uh
the thing that was most provocative is
he said that in a meeting at least the
subject had come up about whether maybe
Pfizer should create its own viruses
through Evolution you know just take the
existing viruses and evolve them through
animals and so they're extended to
different types of viruses because that
would allow them to make better
vaccinations as they might call them
and the purpose was to sort of
anticipate the virus or get ahead of it
by seeing what kinds of things it could
evolve into to mutate them and then you
know use that knowledge to
creative defenses
now
let me see if I heard it the way you did
because this is one of those cases where
we're all going to hear our own version
of this aren't we like I'm going to have
a version you're gonna say that's not
what I heard that's not what I heard him
say so my take was they're not doing
that
do they that they're not currently doing
that it was only something that somebody
brought up
but there was nothing like a vote or an
executive decision
now I don't know how many times I need
to tell you
that if you ever hear let's say I'll use
my example if you ever hear that Trump
raised a crazy sounding idea in a
private meeting
it probably did happen
it probably did
because private meetings are where you
should be raising crazy ideas
to make sure everything's considered you
would raise all the good ideas the
normal ones but if you're doing your job
at all at all you're also going to say
well you know should we be considering
these crazier ideas and are they crazy
or should we expand our thinking to be a
little more you know inclusive
so yes if you're hearing what's
happening behind closed doors it should
sound crazy and dangerous
but the only thing that matters is if
they're going to do it
it doesn't matter how many crazy ideas
are rejected
it only imagine it only matters which
ones they do
that said
could you pick up from the attitude if
you saw the video could you pick up from
the attitude that it didn't sound like
the worst idea to him
he didn't talk about it in horror
he talks about it with a smile
but he did very clearly say it would be
dangerous dangerous yet
right in his own words he was very clear
about the level of risk that would be
and it didn't seem like he was on board
with it
I didn't get the sense that he would be
comfortable with that level of risk it
looked like he was
almost warning warning against it
however
here's the thing that is genuinely
worthy of fear it actually came up
like it was actually discussed
now I don't think they're going to do it
but we're sort of at a place where we
don't trust anybody about anything
so you never know
you know could they do it with a
third-party company that's not under
their control
could they do it with some lab and you
know Ukraine or some other country and
then say well it wasn't us
we just paid them to do it but it wasn't
us
so
um I think it it's a good insight into
maybe the internal thinking
it might be less of an insight into
what's actually going to happen
but it's certainly worth worthy of your
attention I think project Veritas did
good work in this case so I'll give a
I'll give him a attaboy
by the way remind me to tell you my new
idea for ending addiction
all right because I forgot to make a
note to myself so don't let me sign off
before I tell you my anti-addiction
reframe
um as you know
I'm noted for saying that we our
existence our reality is like two movies
that run on one screen
in the past week or so I wanted to
experience the other movie
so I I've lived in a movie for the last
few years which is sort of my own movie
as we all do right we're all living in
our own movie but in my movie there were
a set of things that were true and
obvious
but in the other movie all those things
were not true
and certainly weren't obvious
now it was the same set of facts but
people looked at me and said oh you're
you're one type of person and it's your
opinion that this and that is true
so there's one version of me in which I
was anti-manda anti-mask and very very
skeptical of
vaccinations and always said so clearly
in public
but that's just one movie in the other
movie I was one of the primary Advocates
of vaccinations sort of the opposite of
the other movie and that was Pro mask
instead of being an anti-mask advocate
so they're they're completely different
opposite movies now what I tried
unsuccessfully
to do for weeks and most of you saw me
struggling is I tried to merge those two
movies and I tried to tell the people
who were not in my movie hey you have
some facts wrong or that's not what I
was ever thinking you're saying didn't
work at all
just made everything worse so you may
have
noticed
that I wanted to see what would happen
if I simply entered the other movie
now in order to answer the other movie
you can't deny their reality because
it's the reality
people just don't change their
reality basically So I entered the other
movie in which I was wrong about
everything
and what I really needed to do was
apologize
now everything in that movie is
consistent
and I'm not telling you that they're
wrong
I'm just telling you I've never lived in
that movie before like none of that is
familiar to my experience
but I thought if I could enter it and
just act like it's all true
I could learn something
and maybe maybe somebody else would
learn something too so I've been living
in the other movie for a while and just
agreeing with everything they say
and apologizing based on their demands
it turns out it made them very happy
I wasn't sure how it would turn out but
the people who saw me enter their movie
said yay somebody watching our movie and
agreeing with us not only agreeing but
eating crow and and acknowledging he was
wrong about everything
which I eagerly I eagerly uh
confess in the other movie
now I got so deeply in the other movie
um
that
I saw that Elon Musk actually uh he kind
of crossed over into my my second movie
a little bit uh and I tweeted because
this is something that only makes sense
in one of the movies
in the movie I came from
I would now this is not a true statement
right because I'm not claiming one of
the movies is true I'm only claiming
that there are two movies and you can
live in them just like they're real I
don't know which one's real maybe maybe
neither of them maybe another but in the
movie I came from the old movie I was
one of the most well-informed people
on all things pandemic
seems weird doesn't it like that's such
an unfamiliar movie to you but in the
other movie the one I've entered for the
last week I was the least informed
person on the entire pandemic
right and and you can see both movies
playing right
one I was one of the one of the most
well-informed people on all things
pandemic that's what I was living in
because I literally talked about it and
researched it every day for years
but in the other movie I hadn't been
paying attention to anything
and so as a real test of the other movie
I tweeted that I was just finding out
yesterday
that the the shots did not provide uh
vaccination effect
so I actually tweeted that I was just
finding out yesterday for the first time
that these shots do not prevent transmit
or that they don't prevent transmission
now in the movie I came from that was
just funny
and everybody who lives in my old movie
would have laughed at it because
certainly the one thing everybody knew
everybody
is that the vaccinations did not prevent
transmission
that's the one thing that a hundred
percent of the world knows is there
anybody who doesn't know that now
so when I said it I thought well this
would be the most obvious thing you
could say
that will really out me and the people
in the other movie will immediately know
that I'm not I'm not from their movie
I'm in their movie and I'm being
compatible with their movie in every way
but they should identify me as a visitor
from another movie
but instead
and and I can't read Elon musk's mind
but he did
he did respond
and pointed out that uh
the government didn't tell us as soon as
they knew
didn't tell the public as soon as they
knew that it wasn't preventing
transmission
now I feel like he might have believed
that I really didn't know that
did anybody see the tweet it got close
to four million views
four million people saw it because uh
Elon Musk responded four million people
let me say this again four million
people were exposed to
believing that I was the only person in
the United States who was not aware
that the vaccinations don't block
transmission
and apparently four million people
probably believe that I really
that that was true
right
so
anyway apparently there's nothing you
can say in the other movie
that will that will out you as a visitor
just think about it now I've told you
this before
but this is the closest you've ever seen
to seeing a demonstration of it
here's what I've told you before
a trained hypnotist
can become invisible
I could actually become invisible
to other people's opinions and awareness
and it's the damnedest thing until
you've done it you can't believe it's a
thing
but the way you become invisible is you
just are not compatible with what they
think is true
and once people's frame is set they can
only see things that belong in the frame
so if you don't belong in the frame
you can walk right into it and you won't
even they won't even see you you'll just
be invisible
I've done it a lot of times in a lot of
different contexts every time it happens
I just can't believe it
it is sort of like a magic trick where
you can do a magic trick where
somebody's looking right at the trick
and even as you're doing the trick
because I you know do some amateur magic
tricks uh even when they're looking at
exactly how the trick is done it's
invisible
because you've trained them not to see
it it's just an amazing phenomenon so I
managed to actually enter an entire
movie that I didn't belong
simply became an actor in the movie and
millions of people
took it as truth yeah the Jimmy door did
an entire show at which he thought I was
in that movie
that was that interesting or no
right I'm coping and clotting coping and
clotting as hard as I can
well I did a little uh then I saw some
argument about when we knew
that the vaccinations did not block
transmission
now this blew my mind are you ready for
this this is going to blow your mind
because this is from the other movie
right this is something I took from the
other movie I visited and now with this
audience I'm back to my original movie
here's here's something I'll bet is
going to blow your mind
um on December 20th
I'm sorry on December 2020.
this would be
um
correct my timeline so that's a few
months after the vaccinations came out
right or just about when they came out
December 2020 when did vaccinations come
out in the fall or the spring
early 2021
right so December 2020 is just before
the vaccinations right
okay
so December 2020 the government told us
vaccinations won't necessarily stop
transmission
did you know that
that there was a I forget which
government entity the government
in December 2020
said Don't expect this to stop
transmission
you know it might save your life but it
won't stop transmission I I never I
didn't believe it but I saw the document
yeah I saw the document you get this
gets weirder are you ready for this do
you all remember that the head of the
CDC
said on March 29th
2021 right so that would be a few months
into the vaccinations
so a few months into the vaccinations
wolensky
said in public that the vaccinated don't
carry the virus
which would suggest you can't spread it
did you all hear that in in your movie
did that happen
are you all aware that that happened in
your movie
you did right you can find the video she
says it very clearly now here's the part
that I'll bet you didn't know
all right I'm going to see how many
heads I can explode
did you know that the next day the CDC
corrected her
and said no that's not true it doesn't
stop back it doesn't stop the spread did
you know that
yeah
so all the time that we were saying hey
the government keeps saying that the
vaccination will stop the spread
the actual Authority was saying it
doesn't the government
so when I think you saw Biden say it
would stop the spread
when the CDC said it wasn't you saw Bill
Gates say it would stop the spread I
don't know if he said it before or after
the CDC said it wouldn't you saw mad out
you know yeah Rachel baddo say it would
stop the spread when the CDC said it
wasn't
now did you know that
how many of you knew that the government
was sending two clear messages that were
opposites at the same time
the head of the CDC and the CDC itself
were sending the opposite messages at
the same time
did you know that
I I somehow missed that I I thought that
they believed it all until they stopped
believing it I didn't know they were
sending both messages at the same time
is that wild
is anybody's head blowing up because my
head blew up when I saw this uh are you
kidding me that both messages were there
all the time
I don't remember that at all
yeah so the news was certainly the
wrongest
and the leaders were very wrong
but the experts the the scientists were
saying from the start
might cut it down a little bit it's not
going to stop it
now and of course there would be a
debate over whether it cut it down
right so
some say it was effective against Alpha
and a little bit against Delta
and not at all against Omicron so maybe
there might have been you know a month
or so where it flattened the curve or
something
it is possible that it um
it kept the Health Care System working
oh let me ask you that
given that it did seem to be more
effective with Alpha and Delta and sort
of useless against Omicron
that's an opinion not a scientific
statement
um
do you think do you think it helped
flatten the curve or at least flatten
the curve in terms of hospitalization do
you think it took some burden off the
hospitals
all right let me see a mix
just during only during Alpha and
Omicron when it did
seem to have the biggest effect they
told us
so they're people who think that it
didn't keep anybody out of the hospital
right
I'm seeing more no's than yeses so most
of my audience is in the movie where the
vaccinations didn't ever work right
is that what you're saying
like it didn't have any impact at all it
didn't protect people and it didn't stop
the spread
they lied about that too somebody says
all right so my audience is the this
movie
so the movie I'm experiencing right now
you you all experienced the pandemic
where the vaccination was just a fake
and it didn't do anything and apparently
a number of people believe that our
leaders took a saline solution
they didn't take the actual vaccination
yeah I'm seeing people confirming they
believe that the a lot of people in this
movie believe that uh the vaccination
was always fake
and that uh
and that the leaders took a saline
solution
now you're aware that there are some
people
like serovich would be one who think
that's bad crazy right
I'm going to say both movies can live
and and probably will live forever so
I'm not even going to tell you what's
true or false because I haven't done too
well on that
but
kind of interesting kind of interesting
you you've gone so far that you believe
the whole thing was made up
now could there be anything that is
easier to prove or disprove than that
statement
what what could be easier to prove with
science and rational thought than
whether people were protected by the
vaccination so-called vaccination or
whether they were harmed by them
don't you think that would be the
easiest thing in the world to know
but it doesn't work in our world it
wouldn't matter how credible somebody
was or how much research they did or if
it were a randomized control trial
there's nothing that's going to change
your mind
am I right it wouldn't matter what kind
of evidence you saw at this point you
just figured the evidence was faked
you might be right
might be right
what was it oh
this just made me think of the Epstein
situation did you see uh Tucker
Carlson's
uh episode about the Epstein death
it was really kind of brilliant
you know I say this again I don't
I don't agree with Tucker
all the time maybe
I don't know 70 or 80 percent
I agree with them uh
but his absentee intake but let me say
this even when I don't agree with him
he's always brilliant
like his presentation the topics he
picks just the skill he puts into it
it's just incredible he's just the best
in my opinion he's the best person
working
at that you know doing the the one
person opinion thing
um
but when he talks about Epstein he talks
about the things we don't know
and how much
Bill Barr knew here's something that I
always wondered about but he's the first
person who mentioned it
now here's the mind blower
nobody's ever told you this before you
ready I remember Bill Barr saying he
knew it must be suicide because he
watched the entire video
of the entrance to the area
the general area not the entrance to the
cell but the entrance to the general
area
where Epstein was kept and therefore
since nobody entered the general area
he had to have done it himself
and I always said to myself
well weren't there other people in the
general area why are you calling it the
general area unless other people were
there
otherwise that would be his cell and
when I heard it I kept waiting for
somebody to describe you know the cell
block or the area in which it was in
so that I would know everybody was
definitely locked locked in their cells
and there were no guards wandering there
either
and then then I'd know that it made
sense that you saw that video but
instead
the most likely people who killed
Epstein if you were if he were murdered
the most likely people are the prisoners
who are right next to him
who were told may have had full access
to each other
it's entirely possible that within their
cell block for at least some periods of
time all of their cells are open and
they can hang out with each other in the
the center areas
now
Bill Barr
never spoke to the possibility
the possibility
that somebody who is already there
killed him even though those were the
most likely people to do it because
that's where you put people who kill
people
you put them in that area
you put them with the other worst people
the worst people are all going to be in
the same place
now what can you conclude by the fact
that bill Barr didn't even mention
the most important thing you'd want to
know it's the most important thing who
was there and we know he lied about it
now he didn't lie in the sense that I'm
sure he did look at the video and nobody
was coming or going
but it is a Lie by
what kind
what kind of lie is it is a lie where he
added characters
yes it's a Lie by Omission isn't it
now here's your homework
go find any other situation in which
Barr is known to have lied by omission
I'll bet you'll find it
I'll bet you'll find it
because people lie the same way
right the people who think they're not
such a big liar will Lie by Omission
it's like well I didn't add anything I
just didn't mention the things you might
be interested in
yeah
so I'm gonna I'm gonna go with Tucker's
implication
which is the way it was handled signals
clearly that the government knows who
killed him and was in on it
that the Deep state was in on it
I would say that's confirmed
it's confirmed by omission so when they
leave out the most obvious question in
the story the most obvious question who
else was in the cells nearby and were
the doors open
most obvious question
if they leave that out and by the way
there were a whole bunch of other things
like about the there are some real
irregularities with the autopsy that
look obviously like they're hiding
something
yes yes the reporting is correct
so I'm gonna I'm gonna go uh fully on
the side that uh Epstein was killed by
the government of the United States
or with not by the government but at
least with the um
let's say with the collusion of the
United States
right now
I hate to you know accuse somebody of a
crime in public so let me just put it
this way the only smart interpretation
is that bill Barr is part of the deep
state and that he's part of the cover-up
and that the United States is either
involved in
helping it or covering it up
I I would consider that as close to a
fact as you could as you can make it
right nothing's 100
if you could all agree that nothing is a
hundred percent this is as close as you
can get to 100 I would say I have
certain knowledge now
that bill Barr was part of a cover-up of
the upstate thing based on what he
didn't tell us now he could change that
tomorrow right
tomorrow he could say oh I didn't
mention that but you know now that you
mention it
we do have information about who is the
cells and we know for sure that they
didn't get out
I'd listen to that I would listen to
that for sure
but as long as he's not telling us that
you you have every uh right in fact
responsibility I would say as a citizen
you have a responsibility to assume that
they did it do you know why
because your government
is guilty
until proven innocent and how hard is it
for a government to prove it's innocent
not really hard all they'd have to do is
give you some a little more information
that would not be private
about what was going on in the jail
that's all very easy just tell us more
about what you know about the people in
the little block that's all
so you know at the time so here's the
only thing that's new at the time
it was obvious to me that something was
left out you know what was happening
locally there it was obvious
but I didn't know that we did know and I
guess Tucker Carlson's show did some
research to find out what it looked like
that there were in fact other cells and
that they might sometimes have the doors
open
that's the new information
what I didn't know before somebody said
that I'm two years behind Joe Rogan
here's the knowledge I didn't know
before
I didn't know if seeing the larger
entrance would in fact tell you
something
about what happened in one cell
because Bill Barr was letting us believe
they're looking at this one entrance
would in fact tell you all you needed to
know
but as soon as Tucker did the extra work
to show what it looked like in there
it's clear that that was a misdirection
yeah so based on that alone Boop
I'm going from well and by the way I've
always heard the theory that he was
killed and it always sounded the theory
that he was murdered
always sounded more reasonable after
some initial
initial nonsense
I don't know if I've ever said it before
have I
have I ever said it before directly
because I usually argue the week I
usually argue the weak side
of every argument and the the weak side
was that it really was suicide
right that was the weak side so I did
argue the weak side
but I don't think I ever said directly
that and I would have said until
yesterday I would have said
80 chance of murder 20 chance of suicide
until yesterday so Tucker pushed me to
99 murder
99 who I think the uh the answer of who
was obvious
let's see if you don't the answer to who
is obvious go
all right uh all right let's see lots of
answers you know the Deep state
prisoner CIA
Bill Gates blah blah all right here's
the here's the obvious answer
you all have different answers and now
watch me make you all agree with my
answer do you think I can do it
watch every one of you is going to agree
with my answer
this is who did it
everyone
in power
everyone
right so you're saying well was it you
know this foreign country was it Great
Britain was it Israel was it the United
States the answer is yes
yes it was it was all of them
because they all had risk
they all had risk so you know maybe one
of them did more but they're all in on
it you know I think that's that's clear
pretty clear
all right
so that was fun
um
Trump's back on social media or at least
he's loud he's not back on so as you
know he's already allowed back on
Twitter and now Facebook and Instagram
are going to allow him as well
now there's no indication he's back but
one assumes that he would be if he ran
now this is part of a larger trend
which goes like this
Trump's path to the White House
is really clean right now
there's nothing in his way is there
because you're going to say but Scott
January 6th no he's going to turn that
to his advantage
you don't think he could turn January 6
into a political advantage
I think he can
I think he can totally yeah all he has
to do is convince you that your
government is locking people up for
political speech which is exactly what
happened
in my opinion
yeah he could totally sell that
how about
um
you know I told you on immigration if he
frames it better he can own that now
he's saying that we that he could end
the war in Ukraine yeah he goes uh end
this crazy War now so easy to do
do you think that Trump could end the
war in the Ukraine
I think he could
I think he could because Putin would
actually deal with him
am I right
yeah he's basically Nick's only Nixon
can go to China
he's kind of that's a terrible analogy
because it's almost backwards from this
but
he's the only one
that I could even imagine
Putin would do a deal with
I can't imagine him doing it with
anybody else do you think Putin's gonna
deal do a deal with Biden
I don't think so
yeah so you know it's a Gussy claim and
what would it look like
I see I think if Trump did a deal
he would do exactly what I suggested
you would bring extra elements into it
that are not strictly about the war
you'd make a more you know Omnibus deal
that just covers all of our complaints
so that Russia can make money
uh but nobody will be beholden to their
energy they'll have options and that
Putin can go off and you know be happy
and have some kind of a whim
I I think Trump could make that happen
but everybody would be unhappy about it
I think
you know everybody would be unhappy but
that's how peace works
well
um Biden now of course is up the ante by
proving these Abrams Tanks which are
offensive Vehicles which makes Russia
say okay now it's just a war with the
United States and us because the Abram
tanks are like tipping the scales now
Biden
is trying to soften that by saying oh
we're never gonna these tags will not be
used to invade the territory of Russia
no no defensive we're not going to use
offensive weapons against the territory
of Russia and then what does Russia say
to that uh the whole dispute here is
what what is part of Russia
that's the whole point of the dispute is
which part is Russia and which is not
and then Biden says oh I'm not going to
use the tanks in Russia
no I won't use them in Russia
guess what we call Crimea
not Russia
don't worry
just because you think it's part of
Russia we don't so when we invade those
parts of Russia that we say are now part
of Russia but you say are
don't blame us for invading Russia
because we say that's not Russia
that's what Biden is actually selling
does that feel safe to you
that doesn't feel safe
that feels exactly like we're using our
tanks to invade Russia according to
Putin however does it mean we shouldn't
do it
I don't think so
I think we're at a point in the war you
know maybe we shouldn't have gotten here
but I don't think escalating is worse
because it doesn't look like there's any
level of escalating that's going to make
any difference
it looks like escalating might make a
difference you know on the ground but I
don't think it's going to make Russia
nuke us it looks like that risk is
almost nothing
and it looks like the strategy of the
Biden Administration is to just forever
grind on Russia
and use this as an excuse as long as we
can if if the Biden Administration
didn't have Ukraine
as their reason for grinding on Russia
sanctions and everything else they would
invent a different reason
because it looks like they just want to
degrade Russia no matter what the
Democrats have been trying to do that
forever
am I right ever since Hillary Clinton
the Democrats have been just crazy about
trying to
suppress Putin so I don't believe they
want to end the war I think I think the
Democrats want a Perpetual reason to you
know send money into a money laundering
uh Zone
surprise uh at the same time they just
want to grind on him and and keep him
suppressed
and it might not even be the worst
strategy in the world I'm not even
opposed to it
I don't know if it'll work I'm not sure
I would have done it
but I don't think you could say at this
point it's not going to work it might be
the cheapest
um geopolitical rearrangement we've ever
funded it might be or it could be you
know World War III two possibilities
all right
um
I would like to offer a reframe for
ending uh drug overdoses
and I tried this out with just my local
subscribers and they liked it so they
said yeah try that in public it goes
like this
uh let's take fentanyl overdose deaths
so we're trying to fix that with a
reframe in other words looking at it in
a different way
to try to open up some options if you
look at it as a medical problem
we've tried everything we can try if you
look at it as a legal problem
well
you know the War on Drugs has never
worked from a legal perspective
so the two ways that we look at it is
Medical
or it's legal don't really give us
options for doing anything or we would
have done it by now right
um
let's go off the the Epstein thing I'm
seeing some Epstein comments yeah I
never mind it's not worth talking about
so the idea is this if we found another
way to frame it
could we have more uh more options
somebody says the supply problem but
we'll never be able to end the supply
and
uh then also willpower
some people say it's a freedom and
willpower thing you got to get those
people to just you know user
use their willpower to stop doing it uh
some say it's a poison problem or a war
problem but so far all of those frames
have given us nothing so here's the new
frame I'm going to suggest what if we
treat it as an information problem
and here's what I mean by that
the reason people die from fentanyl is
they don't know what it is they put in
their body they think it's something
else or they don't know how much they
took
if you could solve for that
just information
no the very few fentanyl users would
intentionally overdose
and so if they knew exactly what they
were getting and it was definitely
fentanyl it was definitely a certain
amount and they had learned you know
what they could handle
would it reduce the overdoses without
changing addiction right the same level
of addiction
but could use you change the information
so that when somebody had a pill in
their hand they would know for sure what
it was
now
here's the thing
if you knew that
and there might be a variety of ways to
do it wouldn't that open up other
options
doesn't solve it because it doesn't get
to the addiction itself but it would
solve maybe immediately the problem of
uh
well here's another information you want
to know exactly what's in each pill
or a line right you want to know what's
in it and
uh
yeah you want to know what's in each
pill but you also want to know where the
closest Narcan is you know the the thing
that uh saves somebody if they're odd so
you can buy this product but take my
neighborhood for example if one of my
neighbors you know let's say their kids
were having a party and something
somebody started OD
would my neighbors know which neighbor
has Narcan
that they could borrow they wouldn't
they wouldn't but suppose they did
suppose you solved for where's the
closest Narcan that I can get to
suppose you do and I'll just put this up
suppose you knew that every Starbucks
had one well they're not open at night
so that doesn't work suppose you knew
that every
uh Uber driver had one
they don't some do by the way some mover
drivers do carry Narcan I I talked to
one the other day
but what if you knew where the closest
Narcan was you just open up an app go
 somebody's oding like oh
okay the neighbor has one and also
there's an Uber so you call the Uber
right away emergency
and Uber drops everything and starts
driving over with a Narcan but also you
run over to the neighbor knock knock
knock knock you wake him up Narcan can
we borrow your Narcan of course
right how many people would you save if
you knew exactly where the closest
Narcan was
and the people who took the drugs knew
exactly what they're taking
now I don't know the
the way to solve for that information
but doesn't it seem solvable
does that not seem solvable
at the very least it opens up options
all right let me give you a bad version
of solving it
now the bad version is for brainstorming
purposes and it's not very too far from
what Pfizer was doing
so I give you the bad version and you
find all the holes in it but it might
make you think oh hey wait your version
is bad but if you just tweaked it this
way it might work here's the bad version
the government provides free fentanyl
free
but it's so regulated you know exactly
what this pill is going to do exactly
and you have to get an app you have to
have a doctor approve you for this
system and so it's voluntary it wouldn't
be wouldn't be mandatory and if you got
the app you could use the app to let's
say unlock
one pill per day or however however
often you and the doctor decide
and you can guarantee that you get
something safe
and you can guarantee that let's say
you've got Narcan nearby
so let's say the doctor says we're going
to put you on this app
the app will help you track what you
took and how you feel maybe we'll be
checking your vitals maybe you have to
wear a Apple watch
so that we the app can tell you if
you're going to OD by the way would this
be possible is there anybody who knows
could an Apple Watch if I had the right
app could it tell if you were oding
could it could it determine if
couldn't tell if you're Odin
I'm saying a yes and a no
I see another yes do we know
low pulse
so you'd see it by the you you should
see a major change in a degradation in
the vitals right
low oxygen
yeah so you could you could imagine a
system
that again this is an information
problem right if the information of what
your body is doing
was transmitted
to somebody who could call for a Narcan
just imagine it's automated imagine
you've got your watch on and you've
registered this is the important part
you've registered as an addict
so what do your app says oh your pulse
is going way down if that's how you
identify it
then just automatically the Narcan is is
it starts coming towards you so people
just get a Boop they get a notification
this address possible overdose you just
run out the door with your Narcan and
you go to the neighbor's house and you
knock you say all right I gotta notice
there's somebody here nodding out and
the people at the party go I don't know
let me check and they find somebody in
the bedroom who's nodding out
now remember if you're criticizing the
details of the idea that's fine because
this is brainstorming the only thing I'm
trying to sell you today
is that if you frame that as an
information problem it might open up
options
that's all
and that ladies and gentlemen
is what I needed to accomplish for today
they would sell the watch to buy drugs
yeah they would have to buy the watch on
their own I don't think you would
provide them with the watch
yeah they'd have to be motivated now the
second thing I thought
and let me tell you how dumb I am
I thought well if the government just
provides you one pill a day couldn't we
do this
have the government label each of the
pills with the percentage of
Effectiveness so on day one it says 100
on it it's like 100 exactly what you
think is fentanyl
and it's an amount you think you're
getting but after a few weeks you still
get free fentanyl but the next bill says
99 on it
is 99 as good as the one you were taking
you wouldn't even notice the difference
a few weeks later 98. so basically you
would try to wean them down to like you
know a fraction of what they were using
and then once you've got the quantity
down maybe talk about detox and and
Rehab
but you probably need to like get them
down to some reasonable number
but so here do you see what's wrong with
that idea
does everybody see what's wrong with the
idea and I missed it until somebody told
me
have you ever met an addict
do you know what the addicts would do
they would take the free government
Fentanyl
and they would sell it
or they would buy they would buy they
would just add it to the illegal
fentanyl they're taking
they would just say wait free fentanyl
of course I'll take it I'll add that to
the illegal fentanyl I'm also taking now
now it's cheaper yeah so you you would
never get an addict to voluntarily cut
down their Fentanyl
you would get lots of addicts who would
pretend to cut down so they could get
more fentanyl they would just get your
free stuff and add it to the stuff they
already had that was twice as much
fentanyl half the price
yeah so by the way that was completely
invisible until an addict described it
to me
it had to come from an addict so you
know the first thing we do is keep your
free pills and then go get some more and
I was like
I am so freaking dumb
like if you think if you're thinking
like a non-addict you cannot know what
to do
right you have to be an addict to know
what would work period so so I I'm
really aware that I have this gigantic
blind spot gigantic blind spot of how an
addict would act and remember we all
have this blind spot with the homeless
so many people said oh the homeless if
we just get them in homes
you know that'll be at least a start to
getting them back to where they want and
then you find out that the drug dealers
want to live on the street it's a choice
and you go okay I didn't know anything
about addicts I really didn't know
anything about this situation
all right
um
that's why an X addict is a good drug
counselor agreed
I'm not sure I would want a drug
counselor who had not ever been an
addict that feels like they'd be Flying
Blind
now here's another possibility all right
this is just brainstorming and I'm going
to suggest something that's really
unpleasant
something you never would want to see
happen to any person but remember all
the choices are bad
they're all bad
so
no never mind
I think I need to back off from that
all right
um
that is all I have for today I'm going
to go talk to the locals people and I
will talk to you or I'll say it because
it's not fair to bring it up and then
I'll say it one of the possibilities is
that instead of
jailing addicts you take away their
privacy
that's the idea
they don't go to jail they don't even
have to stop taking drugs
but you take away all their privacy
you track them you you know you check
their blood anytime you want
and
yeah
so it would be one way to sort of
have some kind of system control over
people
without taking away the reduction
now remember this is brainstorming it's
just brainstorming because we know jail
doesn't work right we know rehab barely
works
but we don't know if people would like
their freedom so much or their their
privacy so much
that they would want to get off drugs
just to get their privacy back
so I'm just thinking of all the things
that you could do that would be pressure
or friction
now the uh Michael schellenberger have
and I have a uh I'm not I'm not even
sure if it's a disagreement but a
different let's say
filter on legalization of drugs
I believe that legalizing drugs in some
way is just is going to be part of the
solution it's not the solution
but I don't like as as sheldonberger
also agrees I don't like the open-air
free needle exchange kind of stuff in
the city that just attracts all the
zombies just ruins the city you don't
want to do it that way
but there may be some way to manage
people who are not going to quit
uh without putting them in one place
with free needles which is the bad way
to do it so so
I'm less of an advocate
for discontinuing those tests
because I'm generally afraid in favor of
testing things but yeah you also have to
be willing to unwind it right you don't
want to implement that unless you're
willing to quickly unwind it if it
doesn't work
and it didn't work in San Francisco so
if they did the same thing that would be
done but if they thought oh the reason
it didn't work in San Francisco is
because they made XY mistakes and we
won't do that that's worth testing
uh did you see Bill Gates say he's dead
and laugh who's dead oh about abstinia
yeah Bill Bill Gates
uh his answers about Epstein were really
uncomfortable
they're really uncomfortable
all right bye for now on YouTube
and I'll talk to you tomorrow
