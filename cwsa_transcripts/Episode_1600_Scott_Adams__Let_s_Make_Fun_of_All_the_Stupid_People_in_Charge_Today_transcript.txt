good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you in your entire lives yeah yeah i
know i know you think the birth of your
children
your wedding day you think those are
special but they are nothing compared to
the moment you're about to experience
it's called coffee with scott adams
uh it's sweeping the world faster than
the omicron
but far more powerful
and all you need to take it up a level
is a copper mug or a glass of tanker
tells us time to canteen drink a flask
of vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine here today
you know it's going to be good
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen now go
okay
i almost spit my coffee on my notes
because i saw a meme go by the locals
platform of
people
[Laughter]
i don't even know what that meme is
about
but it's
so damn funny i can't look at it anymore
i can't look at it
all right
i saw a little uh
news item that uh
fossil hunters have found a
fossilized human skull
or was it human
was a human that's the question it might
represent an entirely new
species of humanoid-like creatures
thus rewriting everything we know about
the
the history of humankind but i caught
this little uh note
sort of just
sitting in the middle of an article that
said
uh that we know that neanderthals had
bigger brains than we do
wait what
why neanderthals had bigger brains
that would explain everything
do you ever wonder why it is that we
don't know how to make a pyramid
i mean we could do it with modern
equipment
but we wouldn't know how to make a
pyramid if we had to do it with you know
the ancient tools
and i've always speculated that you know
maybe it was aliens that taught him how
to do it maybe maybe i can't rule it out
but i've also speculated the other more
obvious uh explanation is that people
used to be smarter
and they were just getting dumber every
year
why do i say that
because i'm not sure intelligence is
quite as related to
uh i don't think it's related
to fitness
right are humans more fit than let's say
an uh an oyster
well i don't know
fit for what depends what you want to do
go to space yeah i would pick the human
over the oyster but for just living a
life and
reproducing which is sort of the goal of
life to reproduce
ah
oyster does fine
it's doing fine
so
um
i think intelligence is overrated and
largely unnecessary for
uh evolution
i i don't think that the smartest people
necessarily are the ones that are the
most successful
if you look to look at earth today
and you were to divide the people by the
smartest
all the smartest people and you put them
in one bucket
and then take all the people who are
less than the smartest people and put
them in another bucket
which one has the highest reproduction
rate
am i right
yeah the low iq people have a far higher
reproduction rate
because once you get smart i don't know
maybe you get
selfish or something
once you're smart you're richer
especially if you have money you end up
having fewer kids
so uh everything that we witness would
suggest that we're evolving dumber and
that whatever it was that made us smart
at one point in our human evolution or
whatever made neanderthals have bigger
brains
now here i'm making a big assumption
that the bigger brain makes you smarter
am i okay with that assumption
does the bigger brain make you smarter
pretty much all the time
i guess it would depend how many folds
you had right
but i don't know of uh is there an
example of the opposite
is there anything that has a bigger
brain humans can somebody tell me fact
check me
what has a bigger brain than a human
somebody says dolphins
whales
elephants
is that true
somebody says elephants have bigger
brains than humans
yeah
interesting
all right so maybe the neanderthals were
dumber than us but i think it's funny to
think that they might have been smarter
we're just getting dumber every year
so i wouldn't call it a theory on my
part
more of a humorous observation
over in japan they're going to start not
selling
large size mcdonald's french fries
because of the shortage i don't know if
it's a shortage of potatoes or
whatever the hell they make the french
fries adam
if it's potatoes i hope it is
but now only small fries
so if you go into a mcdonald's in japan
and you happen to
get the omicron virus while you're there
and a small french fry
they now have a branding for that
that's called an unhappy meal
yeah omicron plus small fries
that's a that's an unhappy meal
tm
um
weirdly cnn did a story today about
their own fake news
without labeling it as incorrect news
somehow they covered their own fake news
here's what they did so you know the
story from yesterday
jesse waters was giving a speech the
other day
and referred to a rhetorical kill shot
meaning saying something that would shut
somebody down or or end their career
that of course got taken out of context
by cnn
who who showed the kill shot part as if
it were a physical kill shot like
you know do something bad to dr fauci
which you should not do
and of course cnn reported that like
that actually happened
now it didn't take long for people like
me and people on
on social media and then later fox news
itself
to debunk cnn
and to show the full video that shows
that their news coverage was completely
fake news
right so now you've got cnn showing
obviously fake news
and it's clear how they did it they just
edited out the beginning part
and then
uh
fox news completely debunks it
by showing the part that was kept out
and you know and talking about it
so what what is cnn's move after that
they've been completely debunked
so what do you do
do you ignore it
well it turns out that ignoring it isn't
good for clicks
because i clicked on it it was the first
thing i clicked on this morning
so instead
they cover
the story about their own fake news
without actually labeling it fake
so they showed what they said
and then they showed what cnn what fox
news did to debunk it
so now they showed their own fake news
they showed the debunk which is
completely
complete
like there's no ambiguity whatsoever it
is debunked
and then
those weasley
they bring on a law enforcement expert
and they asked the expert
you know what he just saw and heard and
the expert is like oh i don't know
i'm not so sure that that's safe
or words to that effect and they and
here's here's the best part
they refer to the expert
without showing what the expert actually
said
because the expert didn't say anything
except more fake news probably in other
words in other words what the expert
really said
was probably not the way they they
characterized it they didn't show it how
would i know
so somehow
this is like so mind-boggling and i
think this is only possible
because cnn saw that they got away with
the fine people hoax
right if you can convince
50 or more maybe 60 of the public at one
point if you can convince i'll bet even
higher about 75 percent of the public at
one point
believed cnn and
and their their peers
that the president of the united states
went on live tv
just think about this imagine if you
were thinking about this like 20 years
from now and somebody told you the story
that the fake news convinced the public
that an american president
went on tv and praised neo-nazis who
were marching with tiki torches and
chanting anti-semitic things
and that cnn convinced you
like actually convinced not maybe not
you but 75 percent of the country i
would guess
that that actually happened and here's
the weird part
all you had to do was look at the video
yourself to see that it didn't happen in
fact the opposite had happened he had
condemned them not praised them
now once they got away with that
do you think there was any limit to what
they thought they could get away with
that was sort of the ultimate test case
because if that hadn't worked you know
suppose the fine people hoax had been
debunked by more people than you know
three people working hard at it
basically is what happened
if it had been debunked they would do
the same thing they did with this jesse
water story
they would just say ah blah blah blah
blah go to the next story
it wouldn't matter at all
so they didn't have any downside
for trying this fine people hoax
and then it worked
against all common sense it worked
how in the world could that work
you just had to look at the video but
because there were so much so many more
fake videos the edited version
then full videos it actually
probably still half of the country
thinks is true now i do think that we
you know we collectively a lot of you
helped
uh you know knocked it down from 75 to
i don't know 30 i don't know how many
people still believe that
but man once that's true you can dude
you can just make up stories
because you've proven
that it won't matter
if it's true just didn't matter at all
so that's just amazing it's just
mind-boggling to watch them literally
make up news
and then show the video that shows that
it's fake
and then go on with it like it's still
real
unbelievable i mean i don't even know
what to say about that
it is so extreme
that your brain almost can't hold it as
a problem
it's like too big
all right
you want to hear the best news that or
no the best idea that i've heard in a
long time
because you always think to yourself
well how would you replace the news
what would be a model
that would be better than the news and
my my big problem with the news and it
doesn't matter if it's left or right
same problem
is that they tend to bring on people who
have one point of view and then somebody
who doesn't really understand much about
the topic asks a bunch of questions
and then we're done
and all you get is some misleading one
person's view with no sense that there's
a counter argument
so the the model of the news
completely broken
what would be a good way to fix
the news so that people were actually
informed
and wanted to consume the news because
you don't want to make it boring
if you make the news boring like the old
days nobody's going to watch it
so it's got to be interesting
and it's going to solve that problem of
one expert talking with no counterpoint
and there is a solution
so i'm going to i'm going to describe to
you a solution
that once you hear it you're going to
say i think you're going to have the
same reaction i did you're going to say
to yourself
wait a minute that would work
not only would it work
it would work great
now i built it up do you think i can
deliver
all right i just told you that i'm going
to give you an idea that would virtually
replace
you know 60 of what the news does which
is help you understand the topic so it
wouldn't replace breaking news
right so it wouldn't be acquiring the
news it would be helping you interpret
it
which is
80 of what the news does all right are
you ready that's my challenge to you i'm
going to give you an idea that would
replace the news
is completely practical
completely practical could be done by
the end of the year completely changing
the landscape of news you ready
all right this is not my idea
all right this is from paula collider
paul i know you're watching right now
because i saw your
comment
so paul suggests that someone should
start a crowd
debate platform
in other words if you raise enough money
you can say uh scott adams will debate
i don't john dvorak
or
sam harris will debate
joe rogan
whatever
and neither of the participants has to
agree to this right
they could just be people who exist and
you think you know i would love
to see a debate between bjorn lomborg
and uh greta
right
or uh michael schellenberger and
anybody who has dumb ideas
basically about about either climate
change or how to fix you know the
homeless problem in the addiction
problem in san francisco he's got a lot
of topics
but i would watch him
i would pay i would actually pay
i would put in serious money
uh to
watch a debate
of two people that i actually thought
would be a good point and counterpoint
all right
did i deliver
did so i made a huge a huge promise
that i would tell you something that
could deliberately
virtually
overtake the entire news industry in a
year
that would work wouldn't it so um paul
collider you should follow him
he's at
paul collider so it's paul the normal
spelling
c-o-l-l-i-d-e-r
uh he has lots of good ideas so you
should follow him
i don't think i can think of anything
wrong with that idea can you
i literally can't think of one thing
wrong with it
can anybody
have you ever seen an idea they had
nothing wrong with it
that's completely practical and you can
do it overnight in fact one of you could
do it today
is there anything that would stop you
from
i don't know if there are existing
fundraisers that do that
um
and the idea needs to be dumber or
people won't accept it somebody said
all right um
the platform and moderator will skew the
direction of the debate
maybe but you could have as many debates
as you want if you're not happy with the
debate they got funded and happened
then
make your own debate
come up with your own
i know dollars too much influence
is that the worst we can come up with
you know i don't know if the dollars
would have too much influence because
the crowd funding is small donations
right
so there's no donor who would be able to
influence things
i suppose some whale could come in with
a big donation
yeah i don't know it seems like a
amazing idea to me we should try it
all right um
so i guess jack dorsey made a big
prediction he says that uh bitcoin will
replace the us dollar at some point
what do you think
how many of you think bitcoin will
replace the us dollar
well
the u.s dollar
is almost a digital
currency
is it not
if you pay somebody today are you likely
to write a check
hand them cash or use something like
venmo or zell
don't you do most of your payments
digitally
i mean young people do
so i mean some of you are aren't there
yet
but
what would be the difference
between the functional difference
between bitcoin and just a digital
version of cash is it just the tracking
part
is that the only difference
well if the us decides to accept bitcoin
in payment for taxes
then
that's the point at which i'd say
oh we're heading in that direction so if
you want to see if
jack dorsey's
prediction comes true i don't think it's
going to happen
this year
might take a while
but i would wait to see if the u.s
starts accepting
bitcoin for tax payments
i'm guessing that they that's a tough
sell isn't it
because bitcoin could fluctuate so the
government wouldn't know
if it's
getting 30 more than it thought or 30
less that might be a little
they might have to
feather that in
you know try it a little bit with five
percent of the revenue or something see
what happens
um here's my prediction on bitcoin
bitcoin has now reached a point where
money professionals will start
recommending it as a small part of your
diversified portfolio
would you say that's happened yet
maybe in some
circles it's happening
how many of you hold bitcoin already
uh just as a small part of a
of a bigger
portfolio lots of yeses
plenty of no's but i'm seeing lots of
guesses
so here's what i think i think if i had
to guess
and this is just a guess if you're
watching me here on this
this platform you're probably a little
bit more advanced than a lot of the
country
in terms of technology you're you're a
little more comfortable with it because
you're watching a live stream right that
puts you in the top 50 percent of
people who are comfortable with
technology
but we'll reach a point fairly quickly
where it would simply be irrational not
to hold any bitcoin
how many think that's true
how many think it's a fair assumption
that sometime pretty quickly if we're
not already there you're going to have
to hold a little bit of bitcoin
so if i had to guess what's going to
happen with the price of bitcoin
i would say you're going to have to
include this once ever shift
right so in the life of bitcoin there
will be one time
and i think we're in the middle of it
right now
where it shifts from risky
to wait for it
is it's going to shift from a risky
asset
to one that reduces risk
the only way it reduces risk is being
par a small part of a larger portfolio
because then you know you've got balance
about your risks am i right the bitcoin
is right on the edge of moving from
risky asset to an asset which
common sense might not get you there
right away but actually will reduce your
risk
by being a good part of a portfolio that
that moves in different ways depending
on what's happening in the world
right so that's why i own it i own it
because i think that's
a one-time ever
gigantic shift coming where just
everybody has to have a little bit of
bitcoin
all right
and of course there's a learning curve
how to
how to open up a wallet you know how to
manage your crypto et cetera but i think
that will also get solved by the market
i think you'll get better wallets and
you'll get
uh you'll get more trusts
or or some version of a trust
where somebody's holding your bitcoin
for you
maybe it's insured against lost you know
you get that sort of thing
i think
i i don't think i don't think bitcoin in
its native form
the way it is now can quite be a
replacement for
the us dollar
you need a whole bunch of supporting
structure around that i think
that's what i think all right
i saw the funniest horrible meme today
and it's so horrible i'm gonna tell you
about it
but funny
so this is really uh
it's really a bad bad thing and
if you laugh at this well i think that
says something about you
and what it would say about you if you
laugh about this is that you're a lot
like me and we could be friends
because this is horrible
funny
but horrible
all right this is from a meme i saw
today
it was about kyle ridden houses this
this man proved you can't even fire into
a crowd of democrats
without hitting pedophiles women beaters
and illegally armed felons
if you laughed at that
you're a horrible horrible person
and we can be friends
we could be close friends
and it's funny because it's sort of
trueish
i mean it's not true true but it's
true-ish which is what makes something
funny
all right uh
biden was talking uh yesterday talked
about the supply chain
and there's some improvement there
and he there's something he claimed
that i wondered if it's true
and i'll run it by you he said that even
though there are you know supply chain
problems with ports
he said the ports of los angeles and
long beach that handle 40 percent of the
nation's containers
moved 15
more containers
between january and november this year
than
the previous record
in 2018.
i don't know why 2018 was the record i
guess
what was wrong with 2019
but in 2018
that we had a record and we moved more
than that
so
is the real problem just that there's
more stuff
is that is that pretty much the whole
problem there's just more stuff
and that's it
i see karen saying
he's right
i wonder if that's right
yeah i mean i imagine it would be a
pretty bold thing to say in public if it
wasn't if it were not true
but surprise me
so that changes my feeling about the
the bottleneck
you know a bottleneck that's based on
incompetence alone
is really bothersome to me
because i'm like ah
you know fix that incompetence but a
bottleneck that's caused by
unprecedented
greater gdp
activity
i'm willing to wait that out a little
bit
you know what i mean
it's the difference between waiting out
good news and waiting out bad news
if it's just a bottleneck neck because
we're all incompetent and we didn't plan
well i feel bad about that
but a bottleneck because we're so we're
shipping and selling more stuff than any
time in the history of the civilization
probably in civilization but in the
united states
that's not as bad is it
i mean i still don't have the shampoo i
want
and i have to search the world to find
the protein bar that i used to get
usually so it's still a big pain in the
ass and you know i bought a i bought at
least two items that i won't see for
months
right and i know that i mean i was told
it would be months
so it is inconvenient
but if i have to suffer an inconvenience
this is the one i want i want to suffer
the inconvenience where things are going
so well we can't handle it
okay
it does change how i feel about it
well here's some potential good news
after nearly two years
the scientists at walter reed
have come up with what they think
will be the vaccine of all vaccines the
vaccine that will be the one vaccine you
need
to ever be protected from covid and all
sars variants
the vaccine of all vaccines
and it looks like
they're going to announce that pretty
soon
would that be amazing because i kind of
think it's going to happen
it would be amazing if what came out of
the pandemic was a cure for all of these
respiratory problems
i feel like we're almost there
i think we're at the verge of curing
the common cold
what would the world be like if your
nose didn't run all the time
like mine you know i have allergies as
well
so like what if they just cured all that
like i wouldn't even know what a life
would look like without continuous
respiratory problems
like to me that's just part of the you
know the baseline of living is
respiratory problems
but maybe it's all going away
all right
i always ask this story how many how
many national stories do i become part
of
it's weird i i got dragged into the
whole jessie waters
linguistic uh kill shot story
because there were so there were stories
about that story that brought me into
the story because of my comments about
the story etc
and
i want to do a little experiment
because
while many of you know what things i
have been involved in
there's a lot of things you don't know
about
use your imagination
just use your imagination
and
you know if you've been watching me
since my first
prediction about trump
and i talk about persuasion all the time
now
what kind of projects do you think that
attracts
because there's a lot of people who
think you know i can't predict the
future but maybe this guy can or maybe
you know something about persuasion
that somebody else does know so trust me
when i tell you you'll never hear the
whole story
there there are things that have
happened in my life that literally no
one will ever know about
and i i have to tell you it's
frustrating
uh i will live and die without anybody
knowing who i was
in any in any complete way
and
i get i'm trying to figure out how to be
okay with that because i don't think i
can outlive
all the other people in the stories
if i did then i could tell you the
stories but there's a lot of stuff i
can't tell you while there are other
living people who are younger than me
and will outlive me presumably
so you're never going to hear them
and
so i want to do a little test
uh i want to see
if you can name a story that i'm not
i'm not involved with a national story
so just just name some national stories
and i'll tell you i'll tell you which
ones i'm not involved with
cnn pedophiles
okay you win
oh actually i actually know something
about cnn that isn't public so i do sort
of know something there
uh now assange i don't have anything to
do with oh well
okay
i we immediately got into territory
where i can't i can't answer your
questions because i don't want to go too
far all right
but let's talk about mass formation
psychosis
i was
i was challenged
by somebody who said i hadn't
defended why i say that's bs okay
here's why
so a lot of a lot of the stories i
simply know about the real story behind
them that you don't but i can't tell you
which ones those are
sorry
um so mass formation psychosis here's my
complaint with it in case i have not
been good at expressing it
mass formation psychosis says that
there's a conditions that form
that would lead to totalitarianism
etc
and the conditions are that there's
confusion and you know
stress in the public so if you're
confused and you don't know what to do
and you're all stressed out
you will sort of accept any explanation
that gets you past your mental confusion
so that's when you can be easily
manipulated
now all of that's true
right all of it's true
um
all of it's true
but it's still
so things can be true
and still be because here's the
 part
that you don't need all this
complication to explain
what we experience all you need is to
know that the news is fake
and it's aggressively fake if you have
fake news and everybody's confused and
you can sell anybody any story
but you don't need any
you don't need a a ton of background
explanation
and the thing i hear the things i
have a problem with mass formation
psychosis the first thing is
it misdirects you from the problem
it makes it seem like it's just sort of
in the air
it's like oh just events events happen
that make us feel unsettled and you know
there's the pandemic and it makes it
look like it's nobody's fault
this is absolutely somebody's fault
the fake news
it's a 100 percent
completely
fake news
if we had real news
our or the way we're even interacting
with science would be completely
different
all right so everything would be way
better
i imagine we would all either have
vaccinations or not
or we wouldn't you know be talking about
it or something but everything would be
different if the news were real
and i think this whole mass formation
psychosis
just diverts your attention from the
problem that the news is fake
so uh and i also say that we're always
in hypnosis
so we did not get tripped into a zombie
hypnosis state by this weird collection
of activities in the
you know that form this mass formation
psychosis now we're always there
that's my other difference with it to
imagine that we went from one state to
another
is not how the world works
we walk around in this dream state of a
subjective world all the time
we're always
uncertain and easily hypnotized
always
so i there's there's something
let me take a little bit further
i've told you that i can spot the people
who have my skill
you know meaning persuasion
you know i spotted trump early that's
why i knew he would win because i could
simply see something that
was invisible to people who didn't have
the same experience
and i told you that when
back in the
clinton trump election
cycle i told you that
when everybody in the democrat historic
side kept saying it was a dark vision
everything's dark everything trump does
is dark
and i said wait a minute that's a
professional
and then i i said that was childini or
somebody maybe influenced by him and um
and at the moment that's still the
working theory because he hasn't denied
it and a friend of his apparently
confirmed it for whatever that's worth
so
i would say to you that i can
i can identify
professional work
compared to amateur work
and those are two examples
that i would use to make my case
when i look at this mass formation
psychosis
i'm not going to say that you know the
author who came up with it or anything
was in on any kind of plot
but
the more you see this in the public
consciousness this idea of the mass
formation psychosis the more i am
convinced this might have been a
professional diversion
meaning this may have been introduced
into your
psychology as the explanation for
or the cover
for the fact that the fake news is
really the source of all problems
so i'm concerned that this is
professional
because it has that smell to it i don't
know that this story came up
naturally because some journalists
sniffed it out and it got popular
because oh yeah this explains everything
it doesn't feel like that it feels like
a professional
by whom
well it would be somebody
presumably on the democrat side
more likely
right so i'll just put that out there
uh here's a tweet from a doctor
imrani who according to his twitter name
is an md medical doctor
um and this is what he says he's seeing
with omicron
there are five things he's seen
which he's numbered one through four
there are two number fours
so
uh number one everyone everyone will be
exposed in the next few weeks
no he means everyone
everyone
so this is a medical doctor
based on his experience and what he's
learning from omicron
everyone will be exposed in the next few
weeks
right number two almost everyone gets a
mild form of common cold trivial
hospitalization trivial oxygenation
needed
number three omicron replaces delta it's
already over 75 percent of the
inflection infections are omicron
and number four omicron acts as a
natural vaccine herd immunity and then
the other number four
is it's the end of the pandemic
all right that's from a doctor
maybe the first time you heard this was
for me
by the way am i i'll just ask this i'm
not the first person to say it but
am i the first person who said it that
you heard
that omicron was going to be like a
vaccine a vaccination
i know putin said it but he said it
after i did
putin didn't say it first i said it
first
this was our opinion yeah lots of people
have the opinion i'm not going to claim
that like i was first that's not what
i'm saying but i am going to claim that
i was first
to maybe say it to this crowd
styx said it a while ago
but uh
i would do a little fact checking
because it's actually possible i was the
first person to say it publicly it's
possible i doubt it
um i'd like to interview uh dale now
that we know that there's exactly one
person who has died of the omicron in
the united states
52 year old with some heart conditions
so 75 percent of the infections in the
united states are omicron
and we got that one death
so i'd like to uh interview
dale if you haven't met dale dale is a
democrat
who
explains things to me that i don't
understand
so dale
could you explain to us uh
why we should be panicked about the
omicron
absolutely
happy deal what's your question
well
if 75 of the the infections are omicron
that would be like a really big number
and we only have one confirmed death
that actually
maybe he died of his heart problem we're
not even sure it was the omicron exactly
so why should i be worried
about one death
don't think you understand how pandemics
work scott
that one death
by tomorrow
that could be doubled
yeah yeah that could be doubled by
tomorrow but that would be two
that would be two people
oh you're thinking short sighted down
think about the day after
that would be four
that would be four people why should i
be worried
in a world of 7.8 billion people
that four of them died in my country
well
science
science
and
infections
okay that didn't even say anything those
were just words
i mean i would give you the reason that
i should be panicked about the omicron
get your vaccinations
get your vaccinations and you'll be
safer
okay i get that you know maybe you would
be a little safer but i'm asking why
should i be panicked
i feel like you're not
answering the question exactly
why should i be panicked
about the omicron virus
don't be so anti-science
don't be so anti-science
have you heard of the delta
and c
into a weird
weird world now
where the news
quite clearly knows the omicron is not
going to hurt us
but they can't quite say it can they
why is it that the news can't tell us
the actual truth about the omicron
because we don't have real news we've
got fake news who feels it's their job
to manipulate us
and the way they'd like to manipulate us
is to keep us doing what we're doing for
a little bit longer
now it could be the most
generous interpretation
is that it's a little bit too soon
and we'll know more about the omicron
and you know two weeks we'll know more
but in two weeks we'll all have it
in two weeks when we know more
it'll be over
i mean if it's really spreading now let
me let me uh give full agreement with uh
a rogue doctor
you know i always make fun of the rogue
doctors the ones who are saying the
opposite of what others are saying so dr
malone one of the quote rogue doctors
uh said about the omicron that if it's
really as spready
as all indications say it is
your mask will be worthless
and i agree
i agree
i've long been on the side
that we don't know for sure if the masks
are helping but all common sense says
that
you know your your plumes would at least
be decreased
that was always my argument you know you
might get the same amount in the room
but at least the plume of directly into
the face of another person would be
dispersed
maybe they had some benefit
hard to measure but it looks like it
might
so i was always in the risk management
camp
which is yeah there must be places where
masks make sense and other places where
they don't
but
the omicron just blows that argument to
if the omicron is as spready as
everybody says the experts as the
experts say then i'm completely in
agreement with dr malone
that i don't see how a mask
it makes a good cost benefit anymore
all right
john says thanks for being a day late
and you are blocked for being that guy
does anybody else want to say
uh
finally
you're coming around
so i block everybody who says i'm coming
around
when i come around because of new
information
right if new information makes me change
my opinion
i'm not coming around
i'm not finally getting it
i'm a person who has new information
all right
um
what else is going on
so there's two things we know about uh
coveted tests
one is that we're running out of them
and there are big lines and shortages so
there are not enough coveted tests at
any price
you couldn't buy them even if you wanted
to pay more they're just not enough of
them
so that's the first thing we know about
uh kova tests they're not enough of them
second thing we know is that biden is
going to spend 500 million dollars
buying more of the tests
that don't exist
that's right
the tests don't exist
but we're gonna buy a lot more of them
let me uh give a little uh economics
lesson
to the government
goes like this
if you can't change the
number of
of tests
but you throw a whole bunch of money
into the
system those tests are not going to come
down in price
they might go up
i mean i don't know how they're going to
spend that 500 billion but
the problem is not
that we don't have money to buy them
there's a line around the block to buy
the damn things
the problem is they don't exist
so getting them to exist would be good
and they would exist because the free
market would have already had plenty of
them and they would be very cheap
if the fda had approved them
in a let's say
in a manner that doesn't look like fraud
to me
so or a manner that doesn't look like
crime to me
now i can't say for sure
that somebody in the fda or somebody in
the chain of command
was uh doing something for money that
killed hundreds of thousands of people
in the united states
but it does look exactly like it
so it's my operating assumption
that there was corruption somewhere in
the government the fda somewhere in the
approval process there was corruption
that probably killed hundreds of
thousands of people
and got us into this situation where
uh rapid tests would be exactly what we
need for christmas
and they don't exist
because
probably
there was corruption
and i also like to reiterate that if we
ever find
such corruption and can confirm in a in
a court of law that it existed and that
it killed 100 000 people or more then i
think the death sentence is warranted
so i've been watching this uh special
called dopesick
about uh oxycontin and uh
and perdue
now i was aware that there were some
allegations of bad behavior by purdue
i was aware that those had been alleged
i was not anywhere aware
of how bad it was
if you want to be shocked
at the
corrupt and evil practices
of a pharma company
watch dopesick it's first of all it's
well made so as a as a form of
entertainment is quite good it's just
it's a well-made piece of content and
it will blow your freaking mind
that that stuff really happened and
we're talking about current times we're
not talking about you know ancient
anything
they they literally killed 100
they killed hundreds of thousands of
people for money and they kind of knew
they were doing it
that's right a drug company killed
hundreds of thousands of people in my
opinion
through addiction and overdose hundreds
of thousands
for money
and knew it
that's sort of what the documentary
tells you
now if you know that
do you think that there's no chance that
the reason we don't have cheap
tests is because everybody did their job
well it was just
you know the bureaucracy it takes a
while do you think that explains it
because i don't there was way too much
money going around to not be able to buy
somebody off pretty easily
so
i think corruption will be the primary
story of the pandemic
when everything's done
there'll be the medical story but i
think the corruption story will be the
biggest story that comes out of this in
the long run
i think
um
all right uh biden apparently gave trump
credit for getting the vaccines going
quickly
trump actually asked about that and he
said quote i'm very appreciative of that
i was surprised to hear it trump told
fox news i think it was a terrific thing
and i think it makes a lot of people
happy
um then he repeated that he was a little
surprised
i think he did something very good
trump said about biden you know it has
to be a process of healing in this
country and that will help a lot
so that's one one way to look at it
one way to look at it is that biden um
tried to close the divide
and gave trump
credit for getting the vaccines going
and that this was a move toward toward a
reconciliation and a little that lust of
divisiveness what do you think
do you think that's what happened
is that how you saw it
well
well here's another interpretation
what would be worse for trump's
political future
than for biden to make sure everybody
who doesn't want to get a vaccination
knows that trump was the one who created
this situation
i feel as if they may have tested this
one
you know what i mean
i i feel that this may be part of the
suppression technique to keep trump from
running
by giving him a compliment
for something that a large percentage of
his base hates with a passion which is
the vaccinations
so i've got a feeling this was more of a
way to torpedo him while appearing to be
a peacemaker
i think it was kind of clever actually
now i'm trying to use the same standard
of looking at biden's persuasion
that i did with with trump
which is if it looks clever i'm going to
call it out as clever and that looked
clever to me
in a political way it looked clever i
don't think it was what you think it was
i think it was clever
uh and if trump had done it i would have
said the same thing
well um what is going to happen in a
very short time if the following
scenario comes about and i think it
might
so this is hypothetical
but i kind of think we're heading in
this direction and it goes like this
what happens if science tells us that
the omicron is better than a vaccination
because you know as of this morning it
did
apparently the
the known death rate from the omicron
virus
is less than
the number of people killed by
vaccinations themselves
which even the official numbers would
say
some people
die from vaccinations we know that right
that's not a surprise
every vaccination is going to kill
somebody
but
what we know now and of course this
could be revised easily could be revised
but at the moment
you would be safer to get omicron than a
vaccination
if the numbers hold
but i wouldn't necessarily expect them
to hold you know we're still in a little
bit of fog of war phase you know we
could find out tomorrow that omicron is
the biggest killer there ever was
i'd be surprised
but you know i've been surprised a lot
this year
yeah
so
um what happens when
science tells us that omicron is better
than a vaccination
but the government is working with
entities that have trillions of dollars
on the line
to vaccinate us
three times a year forever
there will be trillions of dollars
in private industry
which will be directly opposed to what
could happen very soon hasn't happened
but it feels like it's gonna
where science says the omicron is safer
than a vaccine
what will the people who have trillions
trillions of dollars at risk
do them
will they say thank goodness
there's something even better than
vaccines we'll cancel our vaccine
process and
you're all infected we're good bam
no they can't do that
if you if you don't believe me watch the
watch the dope six special
there are other moves and the other
moves would be to tell you that you need
the vaccinations anyway
even if you don't
do you think that a pharma company would
just make up data purdue did
they actually just made up data
that really happened
they just made up data
and they acted like it was a separate
company that made up the data so they
formed a separate entity then had the
separate entity
come up with some fake data that was
just their data
and then they said well look at what
this entity says this independent entity
over here says it's safe so go take it
they were actually selling oxycontin as
uh non-addictive
i don't know if you missed that
but purdue actually was selling it to
doctors as the first opioid that's not
addictive
there was never any evidence for that
that was completely made up
right now that's the world we live in
where a completely made-up data
set of data
determined
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
people and nobody caught it fda didn't
catch it and i think the fda was
actually bought off
according to the uh
documentary that literally there was a
specific individual
who apparently was bought off
according to the if you believe the
documentary
so
anyway
we're going to have quite a battle on
our hands if science is on the other
side of these trillions of dollars and i
think that's going to happen in a few
weeks
if not by tomorrow
february 1 the public is done
now i told you that it's hard to have
any kind of organizing or leadership
role in anything
because you just get
annihilated
so anybody who just raises their hand in
today's world just gets annihilated
doesn't matter if they're helping or
hurting doesn't matter what they're
doing
so here i tried to do a public good
by setting a target date that we could
work with our government
not opposed to it but work with it to
have some kind of a
you know work together with the public
appreciation that there will always be
deaths after we open everything up but
to hold the
government harmless so that they're free
to make the right decision
you know that they're not making a
decision and a fear for their own
careers but rather making a decision
that considers all the risks and stuff
so i thought that saying uh coming up
with a
negotiating position of the public is
done on february 1
plus it rhymes um
would be an additive thing
how do you think that worked out
how did that work out for me yesterday
do you think that worked out really well
for me
nope nope so the first thing that
happened is a number of people said oh
yeah that means that february 1
we're all going to
you know violate government restrictions
no matter what
no that's not the plan it's not no
matter what
it's not no matter what at all
that that's very much not the idea
the idea is not that no matter what
happens
february 1 we drop all the restrictions
because between now and then we could
have another variant
we could find out that the omicron is
worse in some way that we didn't realize
we could find out lots of stuff
so if you're saying that you would
commit
to a february one date
no matter what happens
you're not part of the rational
conversation
right it's just not part of the rational
conversation you gotta you gotta be able
to work with the government not just
ignore it
right
so
the productive way to do it is to say
based on everything we know february 1
makes sense today
short of any new information is still
going to make sense
but you have to be open to the fact that
it's not no matter what
right because that's just dumb
you know you don't want to start a
movement that's based on dumbness
you got to at least be open to the fact
that new information would change your
opinion
then the second thing is of course uh oh
we'll listen to the cartoonist the
cartoonist says let's ignore the virus
and i'll go die so i got a lot of that
from the left because they also didn't
understand
that a fundamental part of the idea is
that 75 percent of the public is on the
same side
and that if 75 of the public is not on
the same side
well maybe the government should make
the decision
you know i i only think this sort of
non-constitutional process where people
organize and try to influence the
government only makes sense
if the government can't get it done or
is the wrong tool for the job if we were
50 50
i'd say let the government do it
because you know we all are going to at
least grudgingly go along with what the
government comes up with if it's a 50
50.
but if it's 75
on one side and the government sides
with the 25 well then we've got a
problem and maybe you need a little
extra
little push
here's the uh the quote that i was
thinking of with this feb one the public
is done
not as something that we're fighting our
government about
rather
jfk
ask not what your government can do for
you
but what you can do for the government
this is what we can do for the
government
the government actually worked pretty
hard
you know there was clearly some
corruption going on but the government
in general
has worked very hard for our benefit
in general
most of them right
and
i think that jfk's words you know they
influenced me as a child as many of us
were influenced by them and i think this
is a situation where it's what can we do
for our government
the government just doesn't have quite
the tools
to tell people to go forth and live
their life but a lot of you are going to
die
they just don't have that but we can we
can help them we can say we will hold
you free of that risk 75 percent of us
want it it's just going to happen now
jfk didn't say that somebody says
oh uh
give me the your country okay
that is correct ask not what your
country can do for you but what you can
do for your country but i was uh thank
you for correcting the quote
but it ends up being the same thing
right i see the distinction but it ends
up being the same thing for this
conversation it's a question of what we
can do for the country
so you're not battling the government
you're helping it
okay
um
all right
um i saw somebody say a something today
that we used to say
but i don't think you can say it anymore
and somebody said in a tweet that the
climate is going to do what the climate
wants to do and we can't change that
that's not true
that's not even slightly true
we can totally change the climate
humans have that capability now whether
we should do it
you know whether the risk is worth the
reward that's a whole separate question
but yes
uh
the human civilization
can't knows how to seed the clouds it
knows how to you know put some kind of
chemical in the air that would shield
the earth and no it probably knows how
to
start a volcano if it wanted to i don't
know if we have that ability but i
suppose if we nuked an active volcano we
might be able to start one if we really
wanted to so my point is we can do
geoengineering
it might not be wise
but if you're still saying that the
climate is going to do what the
climate's going to do and there's
nothing humans can do about it you need
to catch up
humans can actually change the climate
now it's just not a good idea yet
but we have the ability
we absolutely could change the climate
so just keep that in your bag of tricks
just know that
well
yeah and for a long time we've been able
to do it but it's it's more obvious now
i think
so feb one uh feb one we the public is
done
uh
scott needs to catch up no it's always
been true that we could do it it's just
more obvious today
it's illegal yeah i mean there are
reasons not to do it
but it's physically possible
um how do we stop school and airport
masking
i think you do that with the help of the
omicron
and the help of feb 1.
i think the government needs to get
focused on an open date but probably
needs a week or two more
to feel comfortable that they're talking
about the omicron accurately
uh
scott we're running low on patience
either join our side or become our enemy
i choose to be your enemy i don't know
what your side is but i choose enemy
because you're an
hide user on that channel
state mandates yeah we've got state
mandates and we've got federal mandates
and i think feb 1
the public has done has to be
the time oh
