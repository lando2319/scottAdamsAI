good morning everybody
and welcome
to another highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with scott adams and
aren't you lucky
to have stumbled upon it or possibly
through your own intelligence hard work
and good looks
you found it on your own
that's called doing your own research
and if you'd like to take this
experience and it is an experience
up to a new level
a level heretofore never known by any
human being in the history of the world
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker chelsea's diamond canteen jug
or flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine end of the day it's
the thing that makes it everything
better and everybody better looking it's
called the simultaneous but it's going
to happen now
go
well i saw an uh comment on locals just
now there's somebody doing this who uses
a cup and a saucer
oh
oh
a mug's not good enough for you
you got your cup and your saucer
all right
all right all right
well someday maybe the rest of us will
come up to your level
saucers it is
just imagine that someday
someday i will have a saucer
well let's talk about the news
i would like to publicly congratulate
brian stelter
as you know he's leaving his position as
cnn
on reliable sources
i guess the ratings were not that good
but i would like to congratulate brian
stelter for being
the only person to ever leave cnn
for a non-penis related reason
so
that feels like a step in the right
um
do you remember a story wasn't that long
ago
about this there was a ceo
named dan price
and he had decided that the lowest paid
person in his company
would get a minimum of seventy thousand
dollars
and so when he made that change
people said my god
you
you are amazing
you're amazing
and so for a long time he was hailed as
a hero
but
there seems to be a string of sexual
assault charges against him
let me see if i can predict that that
was going to happen
famous
young unusually good-looking
ceo i think he's single
what do you think is going to happen
when a young
good-looking powerful guy
gets a lot of attention
i don't know
i feel like some sexual impropriety
accusations are going to come out of
that situation
but
what i say about him dan price is
and i don't mean this to be too cutting
or too cruel but dan price
you're no brian stelter
you're no brian stelter
because he managed to go through an
entire cnn career
without any accusations of sexual
impropriety
now that could be either good or bad
depending on your point of view but
let's say that it's it's good that he
didn't do it
i'm going to say this again because no
matter how many times i say it
it can't be heard
i i love this category of communication
sort of a little hobby of mine
things that can be said
but they can't be heard
what would be an example of something
you could say
but nobody can hear
lots of things
it's basically everything that doesn't
agree with your opinion
i can say it all day long but you're not
really going to hear it it's going to
change on the way in
and
here's one of those
[Music]
the people on the left and the people on
the right don't have much of a problem
with each other
it's just the news
it's just the news
when i say just let's say 95
95 of it is the news telling you that
you're mad at the other side
and then highlighting the people who get
the best zingers in on the other side
and
highlight the people who are getting the
best singers from
their other side
when was the last time you had an actual
you know unhealthy experience with just
a regular person
and if you did
was the reason that you had an
unpleasant experience because you could
tell that that person had been
hypnotized by the fake news
right if you show me somebody who
doesn't follow any news whatsoever
and i don't care what their political uh
leaning is i don't care how left they
are
show me the uh i'll just use an old term
show me some hippie who doesn't own the
television and hasn't watched the news
in 20 years
and i'll show you somebody i can get
along with great
no problem at all
you put me with a bunch of hippies
i love them
i love them
and they would probably like me too we
would have nothing to fight about
then take the same group of people you
know roughly speaking but they've been
watching cnn and msnbc for the last
five years
i can't even be in the room with them
so is there something wrong with the
people
or there's something wrong with the
media it's obvious it's obviously the
media
but the media is also in control of
telling you what the problem is
so the people who are in control of
telling you what the problem is are the
problem
and that's our problem
if the people who were causing the most
problems would also point to themselves
which by the way sometimes they do
and guff held does it all the time
and guff held as part of the news
industry
but
it will tell you right away that the you
know the news is part of the problem
so
you can you can say it all day long but
people don't hear it what they hear is
my team good other team bad
that's all they hear
if you could convince people
that the the real problem was their
believing of fake news
because that's mostly the problem
most of the problem is believing fake
news
here's what we need we don't need fact
checkers
i mean it's helpful i don't mind having
them
you know as long as there's some on both
sides and you can see both arguments
what we need is
logic fixers
let me give you an example
today yet again in the news there's a
story that vitamin d
uh seems to be highly correlated with
good outcomes for people who have covet
if you've got a low vitamin d level and
you go into the hospital with covet
it's probably grim
uh but if you had high vitamin d and you
go you get covered even if you're
hospitalized probably won't be that bad
so what what did most of you conclude do
you remember in
i don't know it was probably early in i
don't know what month it is maybe some
of you know what month in 2022 in the
spring
did i say hey
it looks like all the places that are
having bad time with covid are
coincidentally where they have low
vitamin d
do you remember me saying that i said is
it my imagination there's all the all
the people
in all the places seems to be highly
correlated with low vitamin d
right
but
i want to believe that right
how much do you think i want to believe
that the very first thing i said
i think it was i think it was march i
said the first in may i did a long
thread
but i think it was way earlier
that i noticed the correlation if
somebody if somebody has either a date
on that i'd really like i'd really love
to know but all right consider my
situation right i'm a public figure
and i make predictions and
assertions about reality
don't you think i want to be right about
that
like how much do i want to be right
the vitamin d was really the magic
bullet all along
right because that would make me look
smart
it would make me look smart so i want
that to be true but here's the problem
every time a new study comes out they
show correlation and they don't show
causation they suggest
that the argument for causation is
getting stronger
but it isn't because it's just more
observational studies it doesn't matter
how many you do
because the problem is
that people who have poor health in
general have low vitamin d
so if you notice that all the people
with low vitamin d are dying
it's either telling you that vitamin d
makes the difference
or it's telling you that people in poor
health
often have low vitamin d
it doesn't mean it's the reason the
people are having bad outcomes now we do
know
we do know that vitamin d is essential
for your health i think we know that i
mean i doubt that's going to change
so certainly vitamin d is helpful
we just don't know if these big numbers
are really because of vitamin d or is
just a correlation people who have bad
health have bad vitamin d
right
so i would love to have somebody explain
to people as it happens well we don't
know if the data is right but the way
you're thinking about the data is
definitely wrong
you get that right
there are two unknowns here one is is
the data right in the first place
and then secondly did you analyze it
correctly
and i don't think necessarily either of
them are true
i'm not sure they analyzed it right and
i'm not even sure the data is right so
if you're jumping to the conclusion that
vitamin d has been proven to work
it might be true i certainly want it to
be true
because that would make me look good but
it's not there it's just not there
all right here's a uh
i don't know how to handle this next
situation
so
with your permission
will you give me a little flexibility on
this next topic
because i'm going to confess to you that
i don't know if i'm going to handle it
the right way
right so i'm just going to do my best so
the only thing i'm going to promise you
is i'll do my best
but i think i'm going to fall a little
short
all right
and there's a couple of points to be
made number one if i ever mentioned to
you that every time there's a story in
the news
it comes back to me somehow
like somehow i end up being connected to
stories
and it doesn't make any sense to me i
mean given that i do this and i do this
in public
but even doing it in public i don't have
that much exposure to the general public
but the number of times that i have some
kind of
connection to something in the news is
just weird it's just weird
all right
here's the story
so you know that sam harris was getting
some uh pushback for some things he said
about trump
and
um
here's what happened yesterday i got a
longish message from sam harris private
message
in which he
explained his position better
now here's my problem
what the hell do i do now
it was a private message
it was a private message but i thought
it was an important one
in other words wouldn't you like to know
his argument
i don't know if he's if he's made the
argument exactly that way anywhere else
so here's what i don't want to do
i don't want to read you his message
because it was a private message
but i also don't want him to be sitting
out there
having offered something like a defense
to somebody who's been talking about him
in public
and just leave him exposed
because the worst thing would be for me
to
paraphrase him and then argue against
him when he's not here to defend himself
and by the way i probably shouldn't tell
you what he said to me privately
right even though it was related to a
public discussion
right so i'm uncomfortable telling you
what he said but i thought i would do it
this way so here's the way i'm going to
approach it
do you remember i told you that
one way to see if you're in cognitive
dissonance yourself
is see if you can
defend somebody else's argument that you
disagree with
if you can take the other person's
argument
and give it in a reasonable way that's
close enough to their argument then
you're probably not in cognitive
dissonance you're probably just valuing
things differently
maybe your risk your risk assessments a
little different that sort of thing
all right
so i'm going to argue sam harris's point
to support it
right so i'm not going to debate it i'm
going to try to support it
and then you can see if there's any
holes and i'll do the best i can right
so i'm going to try to actually support
it i'm not going to try to make him look
bad
by giving the weak version
i'm not going to at least i'm not going
to try to do that so if that happens
that would be a mistake all right
number one
does
sam harris think that trump
is like hitler or in that class of
danger
what do you think you've seen his public
statements
do you think that he believes that
now you might remember that prior to
trump being elected
i think it was prior to was it just
after or prior
but there was a point when
when i was talking to sam harris on his
podcast
that he did make a
he made a
let's say an almost an offhand
hitler analogy to trump
so we do know that there's at least some
statement in which he's
made that
reference right
so some of you are confirming that
you've heard him make that reference
now
in his message to me
he said that he does not think that
trump is in that category with hitler
the hitler occupies
a completely different category of
danger
and so i'm gonna i'm gonna say that it
was hyperbole
that he ever compared trump to hitler
but also early on
hold on
early on you could say there's that risk
but now that now that trump has served
one complete term
one would have to reassess that risk are
you right are you with me so far
would you give me this following point
that no matter what
sam harris or anybody else
said about trump early in his term or
before he was elected
that that that could now be discarded
would you would you agree because what
you thought would happen
has to give way to four years of
experience
and i would say that sam harris would be
on the same page
i would say that he would value the four
years that we observed
as a higher truth than guessing what
would happen right
so i would say you all of you and he are
on the same page on that
that you would put a higher value on
actual experience than guessing okay
now having seen trump
perform for four years
i accept
sam's statement that there's nothing
hitler looking per se in that you know
there's not going to be a roundup of
people
he's not going to start a nuclear war
for you know any any obvious reason
and that being tough on crime and tough
on immigration is not really hitler okay
so so far so far would you agree
so his current view is that trump does
not occupy a
dangerous ass hitler situation would you
would you accept that that's a
reasonable evolution of opinion
from
well we don't know what risk he poses
all the way to well we saw four ears
you know i still have my issues but it's
not a hitler problem would you accept
that i do
i think that would be a reasonable
evolution of opinion based on
evolving information
now
what problems does sam still have
well there are two things which he's
mentioned um recently
more than others
one is trump university
as an example of trump's character
the other is
that trump doxed
some citizens
now i have to confess i'm not aware of
those stories
vaguely i can imagine i sort of have a
memory of somebody getting
maybe called out by trump and had
trouble and if that happened
i would be opposed to that
so is there anybody here who thinks that
the president of the united states
should be doxing individuals
no right does anybody think that the
president should do that
no
i don't think that's a good move so we
could agree with him that it's
it's suboptimal right i think some of
you are going to say sure he can do it
if they do it first whatever but
generally speaking
i don't think you want your president
targeting law-abiding individuals who
have or exercising freedom of speech
i think we'd all be in the same page
right
and i don't think there are any trump
supporters
who think that trump
university showed trump in a good light
my personal belief about that is that
trump was just a hands-off manager
and probably didn't know what was going
on there
i don't know that
but it's an assumption
that matches everything i know about
executives who have lots of businesses i
think he had 400 businesses with his
name on it if you count licensing deals
you don't you don't look after all 400
deals i've done licensing myself
right i've had lots of licensees for
dilbert do you think i managed all of
them and
tracked them all to make sure they were
doing what i wanted them to do with my
property
well we required it i mean they had to
report to me but not really
not really that was sort of other people
doing their job and you hope they did it
well
i'm guessing and i don't have any
information to back this
but if you have 400 companies with your
name on it
and you're doing as much business as
trump was doing
you probably didn't watch any of them
too closely
i don't know how you could
so
um
yeah so the question is who did trump
dox but i don't think that's going to be
the critical question here
so
as i understand
um
sam harris's point
and and i'm going to understand it to
support it
there are two examples in which trump's
character is called into question
trump university
and then doxing individuals
would you say that those two tell you
something about trump as an individual
i think so
i think so
yeah
now there
but here's the interesting thing
why would you pick those out
so here's my observation as a hypnotist
as a trained hypnotist
one of the things you look for to see if
somebody is hypnotized
is that their reaction is extremely
non-standard
not completely crazy
just completely non-standard
when was the last time somebody said
that trump has to go because that those
times he doxed people
have you heard anybody else ever say
that
has anybody ever heard anybody
ever say
that a big problem with trump is his
doxing of individuals
so
there's no way to know what's in the
head of other people and so i'm not
going to diagnose somebody
by reading their mind that's not a thing
i'm just saying if you were looking for
a signal for a cognitive distance
that would be a gigantic glaring signal
doesn't mean it is
doesn't mean it is
it just means that that's exactly what a
signal would look like
a highly unusual
opinion
which still has some logical connect
connective tissue
because when somebody is hypnotized and
they come up with
let's say the cognitive dissonance
explanation of why they're doing
something
the cognitive dissonance explanation
also makes sort of sense
in other words they can they can piece
it together with some kind of logical
trail
but you still look at it you say i don't
think anybody else in that situation
would have said that
of all the things you could say
that's an unusual one
so without saying without having an
opinion of whether the doxing
is good or bad i think we'd all agree
it's bad if we heard the examples i'm
not i'm not familiar with the examples
but i'm open to the fact that
if a president docks somebody that's
really bad
shouldn't do that
right
and so
so when you see an unusual opinion
that's a flag
now that doesn't mean that he's
experiencing cognitive dissonance are
you clear on that
it doesn't mean he's experiencing
cognitive dissonance
it just means that if he is
it would look exactly like that
that's all
now the the other thing you would look
for for cognitive dissonance is a
trigger
a trigger is if something that you were
sure would be true
doesn't happen right
so i was i said from the beginning that
trump would be an expensive president
meaning he'd cause a lot of trouble and
he'd break a lot of dishes
but that there might be some big things
that the country wants earliest part of
the country wants
that he would get done
and sure enough he got done you know in
my opinion north korea defused that
you know the abraham accords
you know i think he tightened up the
border better than
you know not as good as somebody wanted
but better than it's been done
you know and and so you could come up
with a bunch of things they did
now in my opinion
my expectation of trump was pretty close
to what happened
so there's no trigger for cognitive
dissonance in my case or at least one
that i can't see maybe you can see it
but i can't see it
because i got what i expected
but now imagine if you were talking
about trump in in the most
let's say
cataclysmic terms before he got elected
and it was just it looked like the end
of the world and you'd really gone out
there saying it was going to be a
disaster
and then trump gets an office and he
does something closer to a good job
not at all what it looked like it was
going to be if you were a critic
that's a trigger
that's a perfect trigger that's that's a
textbook
trigger for cognitive dissonance what
you expected is wildly different than
what you got
and that wasn't true for republicans
republicans expected a set of behaviors
from trump and they got them
for the most part they got exactly what
they expected there's no trigger there
it's only the people who were surprised
who were triggered
so that again that doesn't mean he's
experiencing cognitive dissonance it
just means it would look exactly like
that if he were that's all you can say
but let me take his argument and uh and
finish it because there's something to
it
and he goes on to say that you know
trump's uh what he would say is obvious
character failings
as evidenced by trump university this is
sam's argument and uh as evidenced by
doxing and other behaviors that look
cowardly and or selfish
that those are dangerous characteristics
to have in the president
but nothing like
nothing like the danger of a hitler
and so
and so
when sam says he's not too concerned
that maybe the hunter biden laptop story
got suppressed
for the purpose of
helping
helping trump lose the election
that maybe that's not that different
than
the weiner laptop coming out that may
have helped trump get elected
hypothetically
so if you said to me well those things
are about equal
maybe it would be better if neither of
them happen but but they're not that
different
in
in
an impact
that's not
that's not
uh that's not crazy that's not crazy
if you put yourself in the other
situation
if if you knew
that the only thing that kept hillary
clinton out of office
was some sketchy stuff in the news
in fact maybe that is exactly what
happened we don't know but if you knew
that's the only thing that kept her out
of office and you were a republican
how concerned would you be
you wouldn't be that concerned
now i don't want to speak for you but on
average
people are willing to accept a little
imperfection on their own team if they
get what they want
that's pretty normal
right so i think it's pretty normal for
somebody to say i would have accepted a
little imperfection
to get the outcome i wanted because i
think the the a different president
makes a big difference
now what about the
sam harris also famously
said that he had i forget the exact
words but in some ways more respect for
osama bin laden
than for trump
but this was this has to be
understood in terms of an intellectual
argument
right as soon as you put it into an
emotional argument it makes your head
explode no bin laden's a monster
you know trump's just a politician no
but that's not what he was talking about
he's not talking about you know bin
laden
directly murdering people versus
trump having a policy it doesn't like
the the point was that bin laden was
operating on principle
it just happened to be a principle that
we hate
right but he was sort of internally
consistent with his islamic beliefs
at least the extremistic islamic beliefs
whereas sam's point is that
trump is not
moored to any moral
or ethical foundation and therefore he's
a little more unpredictable and likely
to operate for his own best interest
in any given situation
so do you think that it's dangerous to
have somebody you can't predict as
president
because he's going to sort of go where
where the self-interest goes
that's that's not a terrible argument
now i have you know i can counter the
argument
but i'm not going to do that in this
conversation
because this conversation is to see if i
can explain his argument
in a way that
makes it make sense
without making it sound crazy
and i think that his argument is not
crazy
if you accept the following
clarifications
which he has provided
clarifa clarification number one he does
not believe that trump is dangerous like
a hitler would be
he believes he's unpredictable because
he's not moored to a moral ethical
foundation
i accept that
i accept that if i were arguing against
it which i'm not going to do today
i would say something about the
presidency has more transparency than
most things and that he's offered to
give us
those services on our behalf and we can
watch it happen while it's happening
right but there's not that much
transparency so there's always an issue
and so if i take sam's argument i'd say
there's not that much transparency
there's not enough because we still
wonder what happens behind closed doors
and stuff
but uh it's not a bad argument so if you
allow that the bin laden argument was
just an intellectual exercise which is
what it was that's fine it's just an
intellectual exercise
if you allow that the trump that the
hitler stuff was just hyperbole
and also has given given way to
experience we've seen what trump can and
cannot do in office i i don't think
sam's opinion is as crazy
as you do
let me ask you this
if i said there was some other president
coming into office
let's say it was a democrat and you felt
that that democrat's
history
suggested that the democrat would do
whatever it took
that there was no moral underpinnings
would you be uncomfortable with that
president probably
probably
right
yeah were you uncomfortable with lbj
were you uncomfortable with
i'm not sure about bill clinton i'm not
going to go that far
i have a different opinion about hillary
than i do about bill i think bill
clinton was a solid president that's my
opinion
i think he was a solid president
yeah and i'm not looking for an argument
on that
you know people can disagree on stuff
like that
all right
so how did i do
how did i do
did i you don't have to agree with my
argument but do you think that i've made
sarah harrison's point look reasonable
does it look reasonable
well once you take away the hyperbole
there's a solid core there
i guess some yeses mostly knows you know
we're
we're deep into team sport territory
here
and when you get this deeply into team
sport i know you're not you don't want
to give the other team a point i get
that
but
let me ask you this
did i at least pass the test that i
could i could express the argument
in a full-throated way
would you accept that
did i express the argument in a
full-throated way
i think i did i think i did now that
would suggest
that i don't have cognitive dissonance
and again this this is a rule of thumb
it's not like some scientific guarantee
but the the strong indication is that i
can tell his argument
and i don't have an unusual opinion
about things
all right
so i okay i feel good about that
um
but here's here's my bottom line i think
that the difference between sam's
opinion and mine comes down to one thing
wildly different opinions about what is
dangerous wildly different opinions
about what's important
for example
i would say that the 50 intelligence
agents
lying about hunter's laptop
destroys the credibility of our most
important systems
and also reveals that they're corrupt
and i would put that at a in terms of a
scale of one to ten
that's like a nine
in terms of how bad that is that's like
a nine
how bad is a president doxing
an individual
well on a moral ethical
and preference level it's a it's a ten
in badness
but in terms of how it affects the world
it's a one it's a one
it affects those people and i don't like
that at all
you know any doxing by president i'm
completely against
but you have to put it in perspective
i would say that the the 50 intel people
ex-intel professionals lying is a big
freaking deal
that's a nine
doxing it's a one
except that the individual's involved of
course it's attend to them
so i don't know that sam and i differ on
the logic of anything
i don't know that we have different data
at least that hasn't been obvious to me
but we're definitely valuing things
differently i'll give you another one
i imagine that january 6 would be higher
and well since he hasn't talked about it
i won't put this in his head let's say
me compared to a democrat a typical
democrat would say
january 6 was just horrible like it was
like the nearly the end of the republic
do you know what i say about january 6
again
not counting the violence part which is
if you were a recipient of the violence
or you were jailed because of it
that problem is a 10 and a 10 for you
no question about it
but what effect did it have on the world
or the country in my opinion
stronger
the their theirs well okay i just outed
myself there didn't i
i guess that was a non-standard opinion
wasn't it
so then then i have to ask myself was
that cognitive dissonance
here's why i say stronger i'll give you
my argument
doesn't mean i'm not experiencing
cognitive dissonance
now keep in mind that i've condemned
trump's actions on january 6. so in
theory
that should protect me
right because i'm on record i said biden
one from day one
you know that's not going to change i've
never gone back on that
the system elected biden
so even if there were you know
hypothetically any imperfections
i still go with the system we got to fix
the system
but you got to go with the system while
you're fixing it that's just my opinion
so
um
my opinion on january 6 is that made
america stronger
would anybody agree with that before you
hear my argument
before i give you the argument january 6
the protests even with the violence
which i condemned totally
made america stronger
yeah i think reasonable people can
disagree on this one
here's my argument
it's sort of the jordan peterson
argument about individuals
that you should be dangerous
but learn to not learn to control it
right your nature should be as dangerous
as possible it keeps society
you know
operating here's what i want i want my
government no matter who it is
be they democrat or be they republican
or anything else i want my government to
know
that if i've got questions
and and my fellow citizens have
questions we're going to show up
we're going to show up
well not me i like to have you know i
like to have bathrooms i don't have to
wait for so i won't be there
but
but for the people who like to do that
kind of stuff they'll be there
yeah i'll try to do you know something
useful at home
where i'm more comfortable
but
but the rest of you i love the fact that
you show up
so my take on um
and i'm going to say the same thing with
for black lives matter
all right so here i'm going to show at
least maybe a possibility that i'm not
experiencing cognitive dissonance
black lives matter created some
bad stuff
created you know lots of destruction and
death
i don't mind living in a country where
people are going to hit the streets to
fight for
fairness
i don't hate that
i hate all the violence i hate the
disruption i hate that they may be
confused i hate that they may be
semi-hypnotized i hate that the news
is is brainwashing people
i don't know that the protests were
useful so i'm not saying they were
useful
so i'm going to make a real strong
distinction
i don't think necessarily that january 6
was useful
and i don't think that the blm protests
were useful in the end
but do you want to live in the country
that won't do that
i don't
i want to live in a country where if the
republicans think something went wrong
they're in the streets
and i want to live in the country you
might not like this
where if the democrats think something
is just terribly wrong they're going to
hit the streets
right
so give me the country that protests
thank you very much
and let them let them go wild let them
make their case and let them see if they
can you know prevail
because you have seen cases where
protests turn into something good let's
say civil rights you've seen them where
they don't turn into anything good let's
say antifa
but
i still want to live in this country
i still want to still want to live where
people will take to the streets
all right
so i just value things completely
different than other people and
therefore we can get to different uh
conclusions
all right while i'm defending people
that uh you might not want me to defend
let me throw another one in the mix
jake tapper is getting a bunch of heat
today
because he retweeted ivanka trump's
tweet
uh promoting jared's new book
and people are saying jake tapper
how can you retweet jared are you part
of the you know the elite
what's going on here are you selling
this out say the cnn
observers to which i would like to add
the following context
i also plugged jake tapper's book
when it came out
it's an author thing
that's all it is
as soon as you think this is more than
one author
being let's say professionally courteous
and maybe thinks that the audience would
be interested in the book
it's not an endorsement of the person
it's not an endorsement of all that
person has done
it's more like i wrote a book you wrote
a book about your book is interesting
maybe other people would like it too
that's it
right
all right authors promote other people's
books
it doesn't mean anything
scott is waffling again
what the am i waffling about
somebody says i'm waffling i don't think
i've waffled less on any
livestream than today
so you could have your own opinions
about jake tappers politics and
performance etc but
let the guy promote a book
from anybody
right just let him promote a book
because
um
and i like to say this every
every few months at least
i insist
on the right of association
i insist
as a citizen of the united states
on the right of free association
if i want to talk to the worst person in
the world and get a selfie with that
person i'm going to do it
and i don't care what your opinion is
and i'm never going to care what your
opinion is if i want to if i want to
tweet somebody's book and you don't like
their politics but i think the book is
interesting
i'm going to tweet that book
right there's nothing you're going to do
to talk me out of that behavior so
freedom of association
there is no
wiggle room
that one's an absolute and can't ever
change
all right
um
bill maher continues to be interesting
politically
uh and he noted on the show with 85
percent of the people trump endorsed for
the primaries won
85 percent
uh and he said he said quote say what
you want about mr evil
meaning trump but boy what a politician
i mean that's impressive impressive an
evil evil way but still impressive
so
do you remember when trump first
announced
do you remember what i seem to be
completely alone in the united states
saying i wrote a blog post called uh
um clown genius he was being called a
clown and i said um you better watch out
for the clown
because this clown is a genius
persuasion-wise
and then the clown became the president
of the united states
and then even out of office
uh he influenced
you know an 85 of the primaries
now
can we give me some credit
for calling on day one the first one
at least maybe not the first one but
among the first
to say there's something going on with
this guy
right and i said that he would be the
most persuasive person you've ever seen
i believe that that's now the case
i believe that even his biggest critics
would say okay i don't like what he's
saying
but there's no question about his
persuasion he's got the entire package
he does whole package
bj novak i guess was on bill maher's
podcast and you know he's a writer and
humorist stand-up guy
he wrote for the office and he was an
actor on that bj novak
um
if your initials are bj
you've got to learn to tell a joke
you've got to have a sense of humor
but bj believes what i believe which is
that wokeness is really people
pretending to be offended on behalf of
the people who don't exist
have you ever met anybody who was
offended
by words
i don't never have
if you talk to anybody individually
they'll say oh no it doesn't bother me
it's just some something some jerk said
why would i care about what some jerk
said
but i'm pretty sure
other people are going to be
offended i'm pretty sure other people
are going to be offended
now
let me say again
i'm a fan of oldness
i know i know it sounds weird because
i'm one of the biggest critics of
wokeness but also a fan
and here's how that's consistent
the dilbert comic
for which
you know i'm notorious
is about good ideas that are taken too
far
that's what it's about
because management is a good idea you
can't have an unmanaged company but if
you take you too far you're
micromanaging
if you take it too far you're doing
whatever the latest trend is before
knowing it's a good idea so everything i
talk about is a basic good idea that's
just been taken to some ridiculous point
so what do i think about
calling people by the name
by the name that they would like to be
called
i call that good manners
that's not even a conversation
yeah whatever you want
if if that's how you feel comfortable
i'd be happy to do it now if somebody
said i would like you to call me
king scott
and
i suck before you that's my legal name
whenever you refer to me call me king
scott i suck before you
and i said no no don't call me scott
i prefer to be called king scott i suck
before your great presence
that's my full name
now that would be too far right so
there's got to be some limits on
wokeness
but i don't mind anybody has
he her preference
but as i've said before and i will say a
million times
said before and i'll say it a million
times
in return for my flexibility
and my attempt to have good manners and
treat people the way they would like to
be treated
you're gonna have to give me a break if
i get it wrong
and i'm not going to take any wiggle on
that
if i get one wrong i misgender you
whatever
and you've got a problem with that
if you correct me i will take that under
advisement and hope to do better
if you attack me
 you
everybody makes mistakes
 you if you attack me for that
mistake because i don't have bad
intentions right you can attack people
for bad intentions
you can attack me for bad intentions if
you ever see me with bad intentions
free hip
free punch
let me say it again
if you ever are sure i'd hope i'd hope
you'd be sure about it
don't guess
but if you ever see me having bad
intentions
free punch
come at me as hard as you want
right i tried not to do that i don't i
don't think i ever have
but
try not to
all right
so
let's keep pretending there are people
who are offended when
none of us have ever met any
and by the way if i ever do meet
somebody who's offended by that kind of
stuff
i don't really want to be their friend
i wouldn't spend a minute with somebody
who's offended by stuff like that
because you know it's just going to come
back to you
basically somebody who's offended by
words is just telling you you don't want
to interact with them in any way at all
just run away
all right
uh i'm seeing some graphs again
that uh
people are saying that the vaccinations
are hurting people
because there are more people
hospitalized who are vax than unvaxed
how many times do we have to go over
this
that the population of people who got
vaccinated are by nature the weakest
ones
so of course the vaccinated would have
more hospitalizations
it's exactly what you would expect but
it's being used as proof that
vaccinations are hurting you
now let me be very clear
i don't know
i don't believe any data about
vaccinations
none
there's basically nothing about the
pandemic that i believe
because it's all been we've been fooled
so many times
that as soon as you think you know
something you're like well got
disappointed there
now i don't know if vaccinations helped
or hurt
but i'm going to tell you what i think
my my uh scorecard is all right
this will offend you greatly um i'm
going to say again that i had the best
pandemic predictions by far
in my opinion nobody came close
but i won't get any agreement on that
because people still disagree what's
true
as long as we're disagreeing about
what's true
then you can't say who who who had good
predictions
but
mine are shaping up to be the truest so
far let me give you some ideas
so in early 2020 i said vitamin d looked
like it was
crucial in covet
i just told you that i don't think the
studies have proven it
but they're all leaning in that
direction
right so
if that turned out to be
true or even just a correlation that was
important i'd say i got that one early
and correctly
but it's not it's not it's definitely
not confirmed that
boosting your levels would help you
with cova it might be later
i predicted that uh
the vaccines wouldn't work
right now a lot of people
believe i did the opposite
but when it was first announced the
expert said we've been working for
decades we're not even close
so i said well if the experts think it
can't be done i'll go with the experts
now i don't always go with the experts
but in that case i did
and sure enough the vaccinations did not
work as vaccinations
but i said at the time we that we're
probably going to come up with better
therapeutics
i would say i had one of the best
predictions that the vaccines wouldn't
work
as vaccinations but that we would come
up with strong therapeutics
which i believe we have
then we see the latest studies that say
ivermectin did not work
am i ready to conclude that ivor mechtin
could not have worked under any
combination of when you gave it who you
gave it to or in any combination of
anything else that i would say is
unknown
unknown
but
i said don't don't buy into ivermectin
right away
i said
wait for studies and every day that goes
by without confirmation
you should lower your odds of it working
so i did the same thing with
hydroxychloroquine as with ivermectin i
started with well
there's some indication it might work
and it doesn't hurt you
why not
but then every time some data command
came in that made it look like maybe it
wasn't working i lowered my percentage
likelihood until i got down to about 10
percent and that's where i stopped
so that's where i have it
hydroxychloroquine
and ivormectin
somewhere no more than 10
possibility that they ever could have
worked
in the right dosage with the right
combination with the right people at the
right time that sort of thing
so i think i had the
best ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
predictions
still admitting still admitting we don't
know if they work
are you okay with that
that at this moment we still don't know
but all of the information is leaning in
one direction which is the direction i
was going at the same time
yeah what else let's see
yeah i would say that and then we don't
want to talk about masks but i was the i
believe the only person in the country
who said that fauci was lying when he
said masks don't work
and he admitted he was lying
so i'm the only person who got that
right
and then when masks were rolled out
i said from an engineering perspective
they almost certainly have to reduce the
amount of
spread
but we won't see it in the big numbers
because i told you that you wouldn't see
anything with leadership in the
the state and country level
which is why i was against mandates so i
was never i was never for mandates of
masks but unambiguously if if water gets
stuck on your mask there's some virus on
that water
we just don't know how much and whether
it made a difference but we could see it
didn't make a difference on the state
level
i mean the data doesn't seem to
support it
so i would say that i was by far the
most right about masks nobody was even
close
i would say i was
probably close to
eight or nine out of ten
and i think most people were closer to a
three in rightness on that
now again
this depends on the data that we have
now
continuing to prove out which might
change so i could be let me say clearly
i could be wrong on any one of these
things
because
we never have final confirmations it
seems
but i would make my argument that there
was nobody even in my
general
neighborhood of rightness i wasn't even
nobody was even close
to my predictions in my opinion there is
room for disagreement
all right
so i asked this question on twitter a
few times and i think i have an answer
now about the mar-a-lago
information
and given that a president doesn't have
any requirements for a process for
declassifying
i ask the following question
if a president
signals
that something is declassified is that
good enough and one way to signal it
would be
take these top secret boxes and move
them to mar-a-lago
to me that's declassifying
because it's clear that anybody would
know that taking them to mar-a-lago
takes them away from a secure place
and you know anybody can see them
so in my opinion that would be
declassification and so i asked lawyers
because i'm not one
i said
can a president do any kind of signal
any kind of signal at all
and would that count as declassification
and the lawyer said what did the lawyer
say
what do you think
did the lawyers say that that's true as
long as he signals
by his actions
the answer is yes
the people who identified as lawyers
said yes he just has to signal it by his
actions and it's declassified
there isn't any legal risk here is there
because even if you allow that um you
found let's say you found the lawyer who
disagrees
if most lawyers think it's totally legal
you're not going to get a jury to think
it's illegal
right
if most lawyers think it's perfectly
legal what you did
you're not going to get a jury 12 people
to say it was illegal it's just not
going to happen
there's no legal risk here at all
yes sir
i don't see one unless unless it's a
complete rigged trial and i don't think
that's going to happen because there's
too much
visibility
yeah well we're done with the
declassification talk
all right
lockheed martin is
putting into operation lasers on
warships
so we've heard about lasers on jets
they're testing but now they've got a
laser they can put on a warship
so
that's interesting do you know what
we're going to have to use lasers for
i'll tell you the biggest use of lasers
in the future
shooting down drones
the small ones not not the big military
ones those would be a little harder
by shooting down the small ones
and you know why you're going to have to
shoot those down
because we're probably about a year away
from them being filled with fentanyl
and
becoming the primary uh terrorist weapon
yeah
now i did write a book about that
in
2003-ish when was it
somewhere around there
and it's called the religion war i might
read that
read the religion or into
youtube and or locals
so i might turn that into an e-book just
by reading it
um
but there is no way
that terrorists are going to not notice
the fentanyl is deadly
and is light
and easily available
if it's light
a small drone can carry it and deliver
it anywhere if it's deadly it's better
than dynamite because you can't get
dynamite very easily it's hard to get
you know see
what's the explosive c
c4 yeah it's hard to get c4
but literally every kid can get fentanyl
a teenager can get fentanyl so there
isn't any doubt where things are going
there's going to be fentanyl and it's
going to be on drones
and we're going to need lasers to shoot
those drones out of the air
although maybe that's bad too because
the drone is still going to crash and
the fentanyl is going to get out i don't
know maybe there's no solution
but
um as long as china is sending us
fentanyl and it's going through the
cartels
it's going to us
our our future is guaranteed it's
fentanyl on small drones for
unlimited terrorist attacks in our
population centers
there's no way to stop it
except
wipe out the cartels
and then tell china they're next
i would definitely kill the fentanyl
dealers
in in china on chinese territory
because china isn't going to nuke us
for taking out their terrorists
they're going to get really really mad
about it
but them
it's war
so we we can go into their country and
just take them out now i wouldn't i
wouldn't drop a missile on them
i wouldn't fire a missile into china
you have to do it on the ground
but it wouldn't be hard how hard would
it be to kill a fentanyl kingpin just by
giving him an injection of fentanyl
all right
pretty easy all right all you need is a
blow dart with a little fentanyl and
it's like
and
mr kingpin is dead
now
i don't know how hard it is to get a
chinese agent into china
but i've got a feeling that there might
be a
couple people who are not happy with the
government over there might want to give
us a little help
there might be somebody
yeah blow darts with fentanyl get over
it
as long as the fentanyl is in the dark
okay it's not the safest thing anybody
ever did but murder is never really that
safe it really isn't
um i'm going to make a prediction
there isn't the slightest chance that we
will not attack the cartels in mexico
there isn't the slightest chance that's
not going to happen
because let me tell you what's going to
happen
let me tell you what's going to happen
the number of fentanyl deaths will keep
climbing
and at some point
you're all going to be where i am
well i've been there a long time
and where i am is we're in the middle of
a war and there's nothing i won't do
nothing nope
would i kidnap the president of mexico
yes
yeah i would
if if it would work i mean it wouldn't
work
right
would i would i annex mexico
yep
yep i would annex mexico
yeah you'd you would have a hard time
coming up with something i wouldn't do
to stop this problem
i can't think of anything i wouldn't do
would i would i start machine gunning
uh the
what do you call them the uh the coyotes
yes i would yeah i would start killing
the coyotes where they stand anytime you
can see them from our side of the border
in fact i'd send drones in and just
start killing the coyotes wherever they
are
would it help i don't care
if you if you took out the cartel
operations would have stopped the
fentanyl trade
i don't care
i don't care it might slow down the next
person who wanted to start it
but you have to make sure that everybody
who deals fentanyl dies a horrible death
and fairly soon
i would also start uh executing our
fentanyl dealers
publicly
publicly
i think a fentanyl dealer needs to be
executed publicly
above a certain level i'm not talking
about you know the onesies twosies
street dealers
i'm talking about the big ones
public execution
in fact if if trump ran on that platform
public execution for fentanyl dealers
and i will attack the cartels in
in office
i'd be all in
i would be all in
somebody thinks i'm i support sharia
yeah that's that's a little bit of a
leap
from attacking
from killing
mass murders to sharia law
uh there's a little bit of a leap there
about the mules who transport it i i
think you have to make
um
some
some distinctions
in terms of how much they're involved i
wouldn't kill somebody for maybe
necessarily transporting it across the
border if they're an american citizen
if it's not an american citizen and they
transport
one pill of fentanyl over the border i
would kill them
i'd kill them
if they transported it to sell
yeah
i would say yeah if you're if you don't
live in this country and you take one
pill across our border i'd kill them
too far no there's nothing that's not
too far
there's nothing not too far
right a hundred thousand peop kids
mostly uh well young people dying per
year
yeah for one pill now let me say it
again i would if i do that the pill now
of course nobody's going to bring one
pill
right so that's hyperbole if you're
going to argue about the one pill you're
just arguing hyperbole and that's
useless
i'm just saying if it's obvious they're
bringing fentanyl to sell
i wouldn't care how much
if they bring it to sell kill
all right
looks like uh
oops what's that
uh the secret mice micro lesson yes
all right um
no more pfizer commercials
disproportionate punishment
punishment
yeah
you know um when people are involved in
mass murder
i believe that their own lives should be
used for something useful
not like a regular if a regular criminal
does something you know just let the
justice
thing do his thing but if you're a mass
murderer
i think you should be killed in whatever
way is the
most useful to society and if murdering
you in public make somebody else less
likely to do it
okay
yeah if if murdering somebody in a
horrible way in front of the public i
would hang him i'd hang him actually
because the visual of hanging is just
really good
that's a good visual oh actually i take
it back
now you don't want to hang them because
some of them would be black
so no hanging
no hang
there's got to be something else public
execution but no hanging
guillotine
yeah too clean
[Music]
um
dope six started this yeah maybe
do you own a firearm
i want you to sneak in my house and find
out
yeah my
my uh
my personal defense system is
follows the around and find out
i'm not going to tell you what my
personal defense situation is
it's a surprise
let me just say this
if you get into my house
your problem is getting out
getting into my house or really any
house getting into a house is not that
hard all you need is a you know a rock
right to get through a window
getting into my house no problem
getting out
good luck
that's all you need to know about my my
defense
all right
sounds like a date
all right everybody was this the best
show you've ever seen i think i've oh
let me one more thing
apparently uh
the web browser and tick tock app can
track every keystroke made by its users
how incompetent is our government that
they haven't banned tick tick-tock
what is up with that
how incompetent that tick-tock
which is clearly a military weapon
clearly
is a military weapon that we're letting
the chinese use on our youth
and we're just like oh okay
yeah here you go
so
tick-tock has to be banned i think trump
might be willing to do it but he didn't
you know he didn't get it done i don't
know
what the
limitation is there
um
and uh
oh the big news is that the facebook and
tick tock
have band
controversial figure andrew taint
if you don't know who andrew taint is
you're lucky but he's like the
andrew dice clay
but
he's got more of a homoerotic
vibe to to his stuff he's not gay
but he presents himself in sort of a
homoerotic vibe
uh and
he got kicked off of facebook and uh
and
and instagram same company
for saying things which is fans say
are just the truth
now do you remember that i said a while
ago that no man could say what he's
actually thinking
like you couldn't survive
if a man just said whatever he was
thinking whenever he was thinking
now i'm not saying that i'm thinking
what he's thinking i'm just saying it's
a good example
of somebody who
is trying to say what he's actually
thinking in public
and he's he doesn't have a chance
yeah he got a big following do you know
why he got over 4 million followers
almost instantly
is it because males did disagreed with
him
no it's because they knew he was he was
self-immolating by saying things that
they sort of also believed or thought
were true or rang true
anyway
so uh
well so somebody's saying that uh that
cernovich likes him i don't know if he
likes him is the right phrase
but again
my right of a free association
is not just for me
yeah if somebody i i like or respect
wants to spend some time with somebody i
don't like or respect that's fine
because
cernovich like me
exerts his complete right to associate
with whoever he wants actually is one of
the things i like most about him in fact
he associated with me cernovich did
before before i had much of a following
on social media and i think that was
risky
so uh i'm never going to give somebody a
hard problem for who they spend time
with endorse
prefer
that's that's all just their decisions
um
all right
there we go
hello from nigeria
yeah we have to demand our freedom of
association
there are exceptions um
really
well there would be maybe exceptions for
what kind of time you spend with them
but not for a selfie
i don't have any exceptions for that
all right
there's some entertain taint uh
impersonator videos
all right well
uh
that's all i got for today
would you agree that this is uh probably
the best
live stream you're ever going to see
maybe in the history of all time
yeah
very close very close to the best thing
you'll ever see
all right
uh i did finish i did fix my
photoshop problem there was a setting
that changed
somehow on his own and the setting the
change seemed to have nothing to do with
the brush tool
the brush tool has lots of settings in
different places and you have to find
them all so it's just a terrible
interface problem
