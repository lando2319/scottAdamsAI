um
did you see the uh the Maricopa hearings
about the election
anybody watch the video from that
so in Maricopa there were public
hearings before they certified the
election it was the Kerry Lake versus
Hobbs one where Kerry Lake lost
according to the certification
now they did certify it but not until
listening to the public just rake the
officials for what a bad job they did
and when you when you hear all the
anecdotal reports
of these are unconfirmed things it's
just people talking so it's anecdotal
but the anecdotal reports are just
vicious
I you know if you hear them out of
context you know without the officials
responding to why it's not such a big
problem if you're down a context it just
sounds like the whole election was just
totally
totally just screwed the pooch like
nothing about it was credible but here's
the part that that I want to summarize
ah if you knew
that the difference between a Republican
and a Democrat victory
was how inconvenient it was to vote on
Election Day because Democrats vote by
mail more often
if you could make voting on on the day
of a little bit inconvenient wouldn't
that be enough to throw the election
that's all it would take right
you simply have to make sure that it
doesn't go smoothly on the day of and
and that's it
now you remember those machines that had
been tested and yet it turned out that
they were poorly calibrated for the ink
that was on the ballots
ah
do you think anybody would be smart
enough to know
that if they tweaked that calibration
ahead of time
just make it a little bit below the
level that it might take hours to figure
out what's wrong and correct it and in
those hours a lot of Republicans would
give up and leave the line
that would be a pretty straightforward
prediction when if we can just make the
lines longer on Election Day that's all
we need
because people don't have infinite time
they vote during the work day and some
of them just need say it I'm going
home
so
it looks to me
without any proof of this right it looks
to be like the inefficiency was the
feature not the at the accident and it's
being treated like a feature not an
accident because we're not trying to fix
it
right if you saw some big move from
Maricopa to say my God we've got to
change this system you know we've got to
make sure nothing like this ever happens
so here's what we're going to do to fix
all of this no no as far as I know they
plan to run the next election in the
same way
I'm just going to guess but I'll bet you
the next election has some long lines
and some unexpected technical problems
that don't look like any rigged election
at all it's just hey it's technology
technology sometimes is
is you know a little bit tweaked wrong
no big deal it's sort of normal you'd
expect a few hiccups in exactly the
right place
so we got the most problems
and the place that would actually change
the election
all the other there are other places
that had problems too but
it was kind of a kind of a coincidence
wasn't it that the one place that would
definitely change things
that place had little problems long
lines
and
as many times as they checked the
machines the night before how weird that
they didn't work the very next day
how weird
yeah
I don't know here's my take
here's my take on the elections
guilty until approve and innocent
guilty until proven innocent that's my
standard
and to me they look guilty
so uh you can let's see if I get kicked
off of of of social media YouTube
and the the whoever is watching me on
YouTube and decides whether to monetize
me
uh is my opinion that The credibility of
the last election
is below the level in which you should
accept it
now I don't have any specific Claim
about a specific bad Shenanigans I'm
just saying that the overall situation
with which we've been presented doesn't
appear
designed to make us believe it
it doesn't seem designed
for us to believe it
it's designed for us not to believe it
which causes more problems for
Republicans right what's the worst case
scenario for Republicans an election
they say they don't believe
right that was the Trap
it's the perfect trap if we could trap
those Republicans into doubting a second
election
everybody's going to think that they're
not good citizens
right
so YouTube I don't know who did what I'm
making no specific uh allegations of bad
behavior I'm simply saying that if you
look at the design which is intentional
the intentional design
is to make it less credible
so I accept what I've Been Told
I've been given the officials have given
me a non-credible election by Design
intentionally
by Design and so I accept what they've
given me it's not credible so I reject
the uh
the 2020 to election
in my opinion it uh it I don't have a
specific
allegation it was presented to us in a
way that we're being told not to believe
it and so I accept the message
it would be easy to say
here's here's what we're doing to make
you feel more comfortable with the
result
but I don't see that
you know if you had that I'd say oh
you're designing the system to make me
feel comfortable with the result I get
that now I feel I do feel more
comfortable but if you design it in a
way
the design is very clearly to make us
less comfortable with the results
because they know how to do it the other
way right
do you think there's any doubt among the
professionals how to make the election
completely unquestionable
yeah just paper ballots count on the
same day have witnesses
it's easy there's no question about how
to do it
so it's a choice
and it's a choice that both sides appear
to be making
so if both sides are making the choice
to have
non-credible looking elections you as a
consumer should take the message and say
oh you're presenting us a non-credible
election we'll accept it as a
non-credible election now
having said that
I agree with certifying it
I agree with certifying it
same reason I agreed with moving on when
Trump allegedly lost in 2020.
because you do have to move on
you do have to move on
and that's a separate question from
fixing the problem you have to fix the
problem but sometimes you just have to
move on to
