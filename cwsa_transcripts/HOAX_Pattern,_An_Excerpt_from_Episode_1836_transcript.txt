so the hoax pattern works like this you
start with some anonymous sources
then you add some legal action to to
make it seem real so it has to be some
action
so the action could be an fbi
investigation it could be a special
prosecutor
it could be some kind of lawsuit that
you heard of there could be some kind of
action in the you know the new york area
but there has to be some actual
legal activity
of any kind so then you can say well we
have a story
and then we have some legal activity
this is this is sounding pretty real
you got you got anonymous sources
you've got
yeah
so then
then you go to the amplifying uh the
what if
and as you're saying in the comments
this needs a name
this is the wrap up uh the wrap up what
do you call the wrap up
hoax no the wrap up
smear
it's the wrap up spear
rap
up
smear
so that happens at about the same time
as you get the the what ifs
so the what ifs are how they amplify it
what if
he's talking to putin
what if
he sold his secrets to she
what if
he's working with iran to build a bomb
what if what if
so you can what if this thing into
reality and the people doing the
what-ifing of the deep state fake news
and then here's your real tell
are you aware that
nbc is considered
and i'll say alleged so i can stay out
of trouble alleged alleged
that they're basically just a cia
operation
meaning
that if the and if nbc is telling you to
interpret a story a certain way
you can reliably assume
that the cia is guiding them into that
coverage
now there's one name that i hear
more often than others
as being the most identified with cia
nbc that's ken delanian
now this is not my accusation this is
you know things i read on twitter
but
but uh talk to glenn greenwald if you
want to get a complete picture of how
this works so glenn greenwald does the
best job and i don't want to get into
his turf too much
but basically whenever you see this tell
that the that ken delanian has come on
to say
what if
it's nuclear secrets what if it's the
worst case scenario this usually is your
tell that the cia has joined in this
case
joined the fbi and the rest of the deep
state and the fake news
so the so now you can see the full form
of it
right so there's not really much
question
and as i tweeted today
even if you're dumb enough to not
recognize the pattern this is the same
hoax pattern for most of them if you if
you're double enough direct not
recognize the pattern by now
at least you can recognize it's the same
actors
you got that right
it's the same people it's not every
member of congress or some of these have
some people of congress or some groups
or it's a different group
no
it's the same people but
and uh
the people would be like uh
adam schiff ken delanian
um
you know we've got the same fbi agents
working on january 6 as working on the
mar-a-lago thing at least one of them
and then of course you see mccabe
you know ex-fbi guy mccabe
comes on
cnn to give his opinion
and
it's all the same play
so here's where we are now we're this is
what i call shift in this gif
this gif is a secure place where you can
go look at a secret document but you
can't copy it you can't take your phone
and basically it sits there and you can
be near it
but you can't do anything with it you
can just read it
so schiff has now said exactly as we
expected and remember i called the plays
in advance you know once you see it
developing you can say oh it's going to
take this form
so we're up to the chef in the skef form
so shift has said that he's demanding
a
some kind of defense review of these
documents taken from mar-a-lago
now who do you think is going to look
at those documents
it's only going to be the people with
the top clearance
who would be somebody who has the top
level of security clearance in congress
adam schiff
who has lied to us how many times about
what he saw in his chef in a skiff i
think
how many times has schiff lied to us
about what he personally saw in a skiff
it's happened right that's the real
thing we know for sure
we know for sure that he lies about what
he sees in his gift that that is just
solid
confirmed fact
and that's where we are
now the next phase is to draw down as
long as possible to make sure there's
some kind of an investigation legal
process
some kind of hearings you got to keep
this thing alive got to keep feeding it
stuff stuff but eventually after the
elections are over or after the
primaries or whatever it is that they're
trying to get past i think in this case
the 2024 election period
um they're going to say oops
oops
we finally talked to the people who
packed the boxes
yeah
the gsa employees who actually packed
the top secret boxes
we waited until the end to talk to them
do you know why we didn't talk to them
in the beginning
and when i say we
i mean the public do you know why the
public
doesn't know who those people to pack
the boxes are
doesn't know what their opinion is
doesn't know what they saw
we don't know what trump asked them to
do we don't know if trump was there we
don't know if trump was aware of
anything in the boxes we don't know if
those boxes had only top secret things
in them or some top secret but basically
they were general boxes we don't know if
the boxes got reused
we don't know
anything and
don't you think that would be easy for
us to know
you don't think we could find the
gsa employees who actually packed the
boxes now i don't need to know their
names
necessarily i'd be happy if you know
somebody who's a republican knew their
names just to make sure they're real
people but i don't need to know them the
public doesn't need to harass them or
dox them or anything it's not about that
i just need to hear from them
and the question i ask is this
what right does the public have
to know who these accusers are
because they're not just accusing trump
are they
they're they're doing something that
would change the entire political
landscape of the united states that
affects me
do i have a right to know
that there are some government employees
people that my taxes pay
do i have any right to know what they
think about this situation like right
now
not later
right now do i have a right to know that
i feel like i have a
moral and ethical right probably don't
have any constitutional right
but
why do you think it's going to take so
long to hear from the only people who
matter in the story
the only people who can clear this up
we've not heard from
and we won't
i don't believe you will ever hear until
it's too late
when they do the oops now after the oops
there's another step
where the democrats don't know
that it's been debunked
they will never hear it because their
news will never report it and every time
you encounter them on social media it'll
be like they're in a different world
you know someday in the future you'll
say and remember when that mar-a-lago
thing got debunked
and every democrat you encounter will
say
what
that didn't happen
show me show me the link to that
and then you'll find that there are more
links
that say it didn't happen than did
because the news is
completely fake so there will be far
more news stories saying that this thing
was always real
even after it's debunked so democrats
will be completely lost they'll think it
was true
