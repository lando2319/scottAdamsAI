hey everybody
come on in come on in yeah it's time
the best time every single time
and it's called coffee with scott adams
and i think you're here for that
but if you'd like to enjoy it to its
maximum potential and i know you do you
need a
copper marker glass a tanker tells us
time to canteen jug a flask vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and watch what happens when you enjoy it
you'll feel connected with people all
over the world
doing the same thing at the same time go
hold on hold on i feel that there was
somebody out there who
who didn't participate
boy you're going to regret that
all right so there's been no biden press
conference for
47 days
uh i'm going to make a prediction he
will not have a solo press conference
until he leaves office in one year
here's why i predict one year
first of all it seems obvious that even
his own team
needs to manage that situation if you
know what i mean
and by that situation i'm talking about
the
head area of the president you have the
interior skull part where there's a
a brain like thing you know they're just
as worried as you are right
and indeed i'm gonna bet that his
advisors are maybe a little more worried
than you are
now here's the thing suppose he left
office in
one month what would everybody say about
democrats
they would say you you devious people
you knew he was failing you you limped
him across the
finish line we'll never trust you again
but what if biden goes a full year
and the the history books can record
one full year it feels different doesn't
it
there's something about these big even
numbers that
influence our minds if something is nine
months you're like ah it's less than a
year
but if something is 12 months well he
lasted a year
at least it was a year it feels
completely different doesn't it
so i think for psychological reasons
they're going to have to try to get them
to go at least a year
now i saw online somebody claimed that
if
harris took over and served more than
two years
of biden's uh term then she would not be
eligible to run is that true could
somebody give me a fact check on that
because that would be a factor you know
if if they absolutely had to get him to
go
two years so that kamala harris could
serve those two
plus maybe another four
so i'm going to look at the comments i'm
seeing people saying true
i had never uh ten year max
somebody said oh okay
so it looks like a thing so i'm gonna
stay with my one-year prediction
based on the fact that they're not going
to be able to get him to go two years
like he just won't have enough left but
if it goes a year and a half it's
definitely going to
if they can get them to a year and a
half they're gonna wait
that extra six months all right
have you wondered why it is that a
hundred percent of the public
would like a more reliable voting system
but it doesn't seem like it's happening
there there's not some big
national conversation involving the
politicians
in which the news and everybody's
talking about what's the best way to do
it and
there's a state that's trying you know
trying one way
and we're all trying to improve things
and nothing like that's happening right
there definitely have been bills that
have been proposed
that have been turned down for a variety
of reasons even
by republicans so what's going on
what's going on well let me
let me tell you what i think is going on
and you're going to laugh
at how obvious it is when i tell you
everybody who is elected got elected
with this system
do you see it yet a hundred percent of
the people who are elected officials
got elected with the current system
they're the last people you should trust
to change it
literally if you looked at all 300 what
million people in the united states
and you said to yourself we need to
choose somebody to help fix our election
system
is there anybody we should rule out
yeah everybody who got elected by
that'll
buy that system because they're all the
people who don't want to change it
wouldn't you think why would you change
the thing that's working for you and not
working for your enemies
makes no sense so until we can get to
the point where we can at least admit
that the people who are in charge of
fixing it are the only ones who don't
want it fixed
until we can come to terms with that
nothing's going to happen right we're
pretty stupid
to put the only people who don't want it
to change
in charge of changing it or in charge of
its integrity
what could be dumber than that putting
the criminals in charge of
guarding the loot but literally there's
nothing you could think of that
would be dumber than putting the only
people who don't want to fix it in
charge of fixing it
that's our current system and
in particular i kept reading people's
opinions about
you know this or that wouldn't work or
would work
and i feel like the conversation doesn't
go anywhere
because it's never going to matter as
long as the politicians are in charge of
the systems
um
all right we'll talk more about that in
a minute uh i did hear from somebody who
claimed to be an expert
or seemed to be speaking authoritatively
that using blockchain technology
wouldn't give you the fix that you need
in other words
somebody made the claim was a professor
at stanford so somebody who's got some
credentials claimed that anybody who's
serious about
crypto stuff knows that an election
system using blockchain
is a bad idea well i didn't know that
can somebody tell me why that's a bad
idea now i'm certainly not saying that
that's the idea that has to work it
seems like you could do it without
blockchain
but i've never heard that blockchain
would make it worse
somebody says this is not private let's
talk about that we do have a standard
that says
you should have a uh a private vote
then nobody knows who you voted for but
let me ask you this
let's check that assumption okay when
was the last time you didn't know who
somebody voted for
can you think of a time when you didn't
know
who all your friends voted for
it's kind of obvious anybody who has
social media you know who they voted for
right is he when was the last time you
were surprised
you know now every now and then there'll
be some republican
who you know doesn't write in because
they don't like the candidate or
something
does that matter suppose somebody found
out
that although you're a republican that
one time you didn't vote for trump
are you in trouble i don't know
i don't know um
so i really i really don't understand
why we
really care if anybody knows who you
voted for
so i would i would simply uh test
that assumption that anybody really
cares about
somebody said i could get fired you
think they wouldn't
do you think that you're uh do you think
they'd check
let's say let's say that everybody's
vote
became public just for a mental
exercise and let's say your employer
finds out you voted for
the wrong person do you think they'd
fire you
see here's the problem
first of all if somebody did fire you
for that they're a very bad company and
and they're probably going to go out of
business anyway so it's better you left
but if if you knew everybody's vote
everybody would be in trouble would
would 75 million people lose their jobs
i don't think so now it could be
that companies end up you know getting
rid of the ones they don't like
and hiring more of the people that they
do but i don't see it happening in some
massive way
and it seems like if if a company were
to do that it would be bad for them
competitively
because if there was no problem until
they found out who you voted for
there wasn't a problem they would be
fixing
a thing that wasn't a problem so yeah it
could happen
people could get fired if you found out
who they voted for
but i can't see it being a big problem
i can see it being a small problem but
not a big one
i anyway i won't talk you out of your
privacy if you can
if you can keep it that'd be great all
right um
so i hate that this is the biggest story
in the country you know what i'm going
to talk about right
i have so far tried to avoid
talking about harry and meghan
oh my god is there anything i don't want
to talk about more than that
but
i think we have to because today's the
day we realize
that every story is being viewed through
a racial filter
everything everything's through a racial
filter now
now when i talk about a filter i talk
about
sort of a preferred way of looking at
reality right
it doesn't mean in the the correct one
or the honest one when we choose our
filters
we're making practical decisions like
hey does this filter
work better than this other filter and
the problem is once your filter
gets really really overused
it none of the other filters matter
anymore
all you can see is race now
should we be concerned about racial
disparities in our society
sure of course yes yes we should be
concerned
but does it therefore follow logically
that that should be our almost
exclusionary
single filter on life well if it were
our biggest
problem maybe so right
if if racial problems were the biggest
problem
yeah we should be going at it like it's
our biggest problem
but what happens if going at it makes
the problem worse instead of better i've
said this before
you know if you've got slavery you need
to go out that hard
if you've got let's say the civil rights
problems of the 60s
you got to go at that pretty hard but
what if it's stuff like
you think somebody said something or
they're thinking something
or or maybe it's in their mind but you
can't really tell by their actions but
maybe they're thinking it
when you get to that point and and
certainly a lot of our conversation is
at that point
some of it's still the old-fashioned
stuff which we need to address but a lot
of it is just this
who's thinking wrong when you get to
that point
maybe you should change your filter and
maybe
just ignoring it for a while the smaller
ones
you don't ignore the big stuff right but
the smaller stuff
like this megan and harry stuff i'm
going to put this in the smaller stuff
category all right let me give you an
idea
of what so we had everything in this so
oprah talked to harry and megan and
everything from there's
you know she was wearing blood diamonds
the other day and there's hypocrisy
because megan says she doesn't like
grandeur but she participates in it
but then the biggest thing the biggest
news that came out of that
oh here's the set
here's the second biggest thing so
apparently
there's some question about whether uh
harry and megan's kid
can become a prince now i guess the
rules of the
royal family don't allow that because of
the direction of the
bloodline so until something changes or
their father becomes the king i guess
the kid can't get a title but that's
just the established rules
but of course megan has sold that to the
public as if
it's because the kid is 12 black
all right maybe that's why but here's
the title
that he could have had little archie he
could have been the earl of dumbarton
so instead of getting a title as a
prince the other option was the earl of
dumbarton
now if archie were not 12
black do you think that they would have
offered him such an insulting title that
has dumb right in the name of it
the earl of dumbarton
[Laughter]
but he also could have been lord
archie mountain bar mount baton windsor
so he could have been a lord but i guess
they're gonna wait
wait for the prince thing maybe all
right
but uh then she then megan throws the
royal family into the bus by saying that
there was some kind of conversation but
we don't know who was in
it this is the fun part we don't know
who said this
but somebody in the royal family was a
little bit worried
about little archie coming in a little
bit too brown
and what would they do what would the
royal family do
if one of the royals was ah just a
little bit too brown
so of course racism is all over this but
the funniest part is that they won't say
who said it
which makes the entire royal family look
like a bunch of racists
now i'm not saying they're not i don't
know them
at all but
here's what i say then i think
michael knowles in a tweet summed it up
the best so michael knowles said a
hollywood actress is complaining to a
billionaire talk show host
about how much she regrets becoming a
princess
and according to our insane culture she
actually is a victim
that is the best summary of this whole
situation
i've ever heard the fact that any of
these people are considering themselves
victims
i guess you i guess you never met a real
victim
here's what i think the country needs i
think we need to
be smarter about what filter we put on
everything you're going to see that the
rest of the news is
all about racism racism and i'm not
saying racism isn't important
i'm saying if it's your only filter
you're not going to get what you want
which is you know better life happiness
and all that stuff
so i think the other filters which are
better economics
looking at everything through a money
filter is
fairly revealing right
looking at things through a success
versus failure filter
what works and what doesn't looking at
it as systems versus goals
systems versus goals take uh
the uh george floyd trial which starts
today
black lives matter protesters have
already surrounded it
and they're calling for a certain
outcome
now if you're calling for an outcome are
you respecting the system
or you just want a certain outcome and
it's pretty clear to me that these are
people who see the world through a
racial filter
and so they want an outcome which agrees
with their racial view of the world
whereas other people are saying um
shouldn't we be more concerned about the
judicial system working properly
and then whatever comes out of it is
what comes out but shouldn't the system
be where you're
sort of putting your energy so
i would say let's put the systems filter
on that and also a game strategy
you know you should be looking at life
as to what gives you the advantage
don't look at it just as racial equality
what gives you
more than equality if you're black why
would you settle for being equal
why would you settle for that because as
an individual
you could do better than that you don't
have to be average
you don't have to meet the average of
what white people do
why wouldn't you be shooting well above
that so even having a goal
of equality is the wrong filter
you know do you know what filter my
parents gave me
inequality inequality
my mother said to me directly and often
life isn't fair make sure you get on the
right side of that
she used different words but she would
say it all the time life isn't fair
make sure you you're fighting to get
your your peace
because it's not going to be given to
you because it's fair
you got to go out and get it so when i
see black people
arguing for you know equity equality
fairness i say to myself you're kind of
selling yourself short there
what is it that you're thinking that
would keep you from doing better than
average
right or at least you know uh that
should be a uh
an ambition certainly mine was i
i never started life thinking i'm gonna
be average
if i can only if i can only get up to
the average of what white people do
man i've made it no
no don't fight for equal
if you're fighting for equal you're just
fighting for the wrong stuff
fight for better all right
trump says he's going to work to unseat
alaska's murkowski senator mikowski
calling her
disloyal now what do you think of that
what do you think of trump
targeting somebody who sometimes votes
the other way
it's a really really good strategy
let me tell you why i've told you this
before but every time you see trump do
it
it's worth calling it out if you want to
be influential
it really helps to complement people who
are on your team
oh that's senator lindsey graham he's a
great guy
i love senator graham he's on my team
but that's only half of it you have to
actually
destroy the people who are on the other
side against you
it's not good enough that you just say
ah they're wrong blah blah blah
you want to make the biggest difference
between being on your side
and being against you if you're on you
if you're on his side you get all these
praise and and all that access etc and
if you're against him he's going to put
you out of business
he's not just going to ignore you he's
going to put you at a fricking business
that's the biggest difference between
making him happy and making him unhappy
what other politician does that
none none nobody else does that
and what do we say about trump now the
the data supports the fact
that he's the most persuasive politician
that's one of the techniques i saw my
co-worker
who became the model for the alice
character in the dilbert comic
she used that technique if you did
something for her at work
she would buy flowers for you at work
and give them to you and then tell your
boss
that i just gave flowers to your
employees such a great employee
man you should you should think about
promoting that employee who just helped
me out or maybe giving a raise
do you think that employee would help
her the next time
yeah yeah she got a promotion out of it
and it wasn't even her boss she'd still
get a promotion out of it
or almost
if anybody went against her she would go
to their boss and tell them they should
be fired
literally yeah you should just get rid
of this person they're just slowing
everything down i can't get anything
done
you just fire this person and that was
the trump strategy the biggest
difference between
happy and unhappy all right um
let's talk about the george floyd trout
trial
i don't see any other way this can go i
think there will not be any murder
conviction
of any degree of murder and here's my
take on it we know that he had fentanyl
in his system
and that should be enough
enough cause for uh doubt now
what about the knee that was on george
floyd's
neck well i'd like to do a demonstration
for you because a lot of people said
they saw that on video
and it was obvious to them because you
just look at the video
that his neck was being compressed at
the same time he was complaining about
not being able to breathe
and so i don't want you to be scared but
i'm going to do a little demonstration
for you right
right live in which i'm going to
okay now don't be afraid
i have my hand tightly around my neck
i'm squeezing pretty hard
but i'm not really that close to dying
it looks like it doesn't it because i i
am actually squeezing really hard
but i don't feel like i can't breathe
i've got a little asthma and
pretty good how about if i did it a
different way
i'm pressing as hard as i can i'm
actually literally pressing as hard as i
can
on my neck with both hands and
i seem to be able to breathe just fine
now do you think
that the purpose of the knee hold when a
cop
uses it because apparently the
procedures do describe this as a
an allowed police procedure in some
places maybe not everywhere
do you think that the procedure is to
put your neck your
your knee on a neck so hard that the
person can't breathe
do you believe do you believe that
that's the purpose of the hold
to reduce the breathing because it
doesn't look like it i'm no expert
but it looks to me like putting a
control around something that's hard for
a person to get out of
you're just sort of controlling it so
they can't get up
am i wrong somebody says he was cutting
off his
carotid carotid artery well
um didn't look like it to me to me it
looked like his knee
was simply creating a a cage if you will
for his head
which i i'm sure would be the actual
purpose of the technique
i don't believe the purpose of the
technique is to cut off his air supply
so if he did it wrong well maybe there's
something to talk about
but i didn't see anything that looked
wrong it looked like a standard
making sure he can't get up kind of
thing yeah the knee was acting as a
barrier
as opposed to trying to reduce his hair
if you um and of course floyd was
talking
so the fact that he could talk
sort of suggests there was some air
coming through now did the fentanyl kill
him
well we don't know but we know that
fentanyl kills exactly that way
exactly that way and that he had it in a
symptom
in his system now i'm going to throw in
another wrinkle here that you hadn't
thought of
i talked about filters biasing you to
see
something through the filter but you can
also be biased
by an analogy in other words there could
be something else happening in society
that sort of primes your mind for a
completely unrelated situation
and that's happening right now and it
looks like this
we are declaring that people are dying
of coronavirus
recovered if they have a comorbidity
so we're saying yeah sure you also had
you know some
diabetes and stuff but what killed you
was
the covet that's the cause cause of
death
so you take that analogy which
has nothing to do with george floyd
right let's agree
th they're completely separate right you
should not be using
anything about one to make a decision on
the other
but our brains don't work that way
our brains can't make a clean difference
between
things happening they all just sort of
conflate
we can't help it they just sort of
conflate
and so i wonder if a juror who's watched
half a million people be labeled as
death by coronavirus knowing that almost
every one of them had at least
one other thing that could have killed
them weight
diabetes whatever um
i think that i think that will influence
people
and i think that that would be more
likely to see the fentanyl
as a cause than they would have been if
they had not been primed
by half a million american deaths that
were attributed to the
virus as opposed to the other things
going on
right doesn't make sense there's no
logic to it
but our brains are not logic machines we
see patterns
and we overuse the patterns that's why
racism exists
because we see patterns but we're not
that good at it right
so we got that going on i would contend
that i
although i have never been to law school
i could get
i could get that cop off kind of easily
i don't even think this is a hard case
do you
now there could be an issue that the
jury just they're influenced by the
filters of racism
and they don't really care if he's
guilty or not they just want a certain
result
that's possible but can you get 12
people like that
i don't think you can get 12 people
to to convict this guy now
uh and even the manslaughter sort of uh
assumes that he was acting recklessly
but i don't know i watched the video
and i feel as though george floyd
probably would have died then no matter
what they did
because if he didn't die because of the
pressure on him
if he died because of the fentanyl he
only had a few minutes anyway
right unfortunately now if anybody's
new to this broadcast my stepson
died of an overdose which included
fentanyl of course
in 2018. so unfortunately i know a
little bit too much about this
topic and all you'd have to do is
describe to the jury
how much of fentanyl kills people 50 to
70 000 people
a year dying exactly this way
and then this is sort of a sideshow but
apparently
floyd actually had coronavirus too
so he actually had coveted 19. now
nobody thinks that that killed him
because he was young and healthy
now the other thing that you would have
to prove i think
uh is that there was some reason
that the cops would kill this guy as
opposed to
anybody else they stopped and the reason
of course would be racism right
so the the presumed motive of either
killing him or if you prefer
not killing him but rather being
reckless
whichever it was um
you assume that the reason that the jury
will be presented with is that there was
some racial motive
but let's use a little common sense here
isn't it size that was the problem
well it wasn't the fact that the cops
were all smallish
none of the cops were big guys but
george floyd was a really big guy
like and muscular too like he looks like
um
i saw something that compared him to
looking like lebron james
like he's a big substantial guy now if
he were a big substantial guy of any
other race
and the cops were three small guys and
he was not cooperating physically
isn't size the problem
isn't it and i i've often wondered that
see no but nobody's willing to say this
because it
sounds racist so you have to word it as
carefully as you possibly can
but do you think that
do you think there's any difference in
the physical let's say
physical capability of different groups
who get stopped by the police
i think so i think if you you stop
some people they look stronger and
bigger so they're scarier
and you would use different process to
control them
so somebody said to me um hey you know
he was complaining that he couldn't
breathe for eight minutes
um so therefore it's obviously murder
if he's complaining that he's dying and
they don't do anything about it it's
obviously murder
to which i say what were they supposed
to do
what were they supposed to do what was
the other thing they could have done
remember he was at resisting arrest he's
really big and the next people that
whoever is the next person who gets
apprehended will
will complain about not being able to
breathe how many people who are stopped
and let's say controlled by police like
physically controlled
how many of them complain that the
police are hurting them or killing them
or they can't breathe
how many would say they can't breathe
if all you had to do is say that and the
police had to light you up
there's not like a second way to do this
is there
could they have just handcuffed oh maybe
they could have handcuffed them
i suppose they could have handcuffed
them and maybe put them up
but you have to ask the question what
happens if
we assume police can somebody who's got
some police experience tell me this
don't people who get apprehended by
police
complain about not being able to breathe
sort of routinely
somebody says he was cuffed if he was
cuffed
how hard do you think that they were
leaning on him to stay down
if he was cuffed i mean it couldn't have
been that dangerous so a lot of
a lot of good questions here but i can't
imagine that
we'll get a murder conviction
um so
and then we're going to have riots and
people will die
because you know that's coming right you
know there will be george floyd riots
and people will die who do we blame for
that
racism the cops or the fake
news because the fake news isn't going
to say anything that i just said
and and there's a lot of nuance and
context here that's important
i would say that the fake news is quite
clearly going to murder
a number of citizens right in front of
us
because the fake news could make this
stop just by
adding the right context and saying
saying basically what i said
so you you just see it with a little
more fullness
but they won't because i think they like
their riots good for business
did you see the social media tweets
where
there are some grocery stores that are
labeling some of the products
as black owned businesses so
some food will say this is made by a
black-owned business
and i saw a complaint from an
african-american gentleman saying that
why is anybody complaining about this
because we already label
mexican and chinese food so
how is this any different to which i say
that's labeling the food
if you label the food you're just
telling the person what they're buying
that's different than labeling the owner
labeling the odor isn't even a little
bit similar to labeling the food
what exactly is you know the
the black part of the food that they
were labeling black i think it was just
generic food i don't think it was any
like special cultural black kind of food
and i and then the rejoinder was that a
lot of black businesses were
shut out of getting ppa ppp
stuff and and other benefits and that
this would at least help them compensate
for that
now i don't know if that happened that's
bad right so i don't know the details
but if in fact
black businesses were somehow shut out
of things that other people got
that would be very bad i wouldn't want
to see that but
i don't know if i could support racism
as the solution to that
because it feels not feels it's
blatantly racist
to call out the ethnicity of somebody as
the owner
as a reason you should buy something is
as racist as anything could be
like it's the definition of racism so
uh you could be you could be very
pro-black as i am
super pro-black um
and still see this is a bad idea all
right
so let me ask you this
um there's a story in the news
that makes me really wonder
about something it goes like this
that there's this bacteria called a
cyano
bacteria or maybe it's chiana bacteria
cyan how would you pronounce that
chiana bacteria maybe um
and it converts carbon dioxide to oxygen
and it can and this bacteria could live
in the harshest environments
including including maybe mars
so there's some thinking that you could
dump a bunch of this bacteria on mars
and let it create an oxygen atmosphere
but what would happen if that was done
wouldn't it just keep going and get rid
of all the carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere
and then somebody said if that works
why aren't we using that here on earth
uh if we can convert carbon dioxide to
oxygen
with a bacteria that we already have
um what's the mean temperature on mars i
don't know it's cooler than earth right
but apparently there's some indication
that this bacteria could live in the
harsh conditions on mars
so that we we understand that that's
actually feasible
would we be creating martian global
warming no the opposite
because it would be removing the co2
from the air
trees do that already well
if trees do that already but a tree
wouldn't grow on mars
so maybe that's the whole answer maybe
the fact that the tree does it more
efficiently
than the bacteria is all you need to
know could be
yeah so obviously the problem with trees
is you don't have enough of them to get
it done
but if the bacteria is more efficient
per square inch
could you put a just a ton of bacteria
in a box
put it on your porch and have it
changing the air while you're sitting
there it's just questions
i've got questions but here's the
interesting part
in our lifetime we already have the
technology to terraform a planet
if you don't think that humanity is
evolving into god
we're talking about completely feasibly
terraforming mars like that's actually a
conversation
and it doesn't seem like there's
anything that would stop us from doing
it
because it would take a while i mean
you'd have to put that bacteria there
and
maybe you have to wait ten thousand
years but it looks like we know how to
do it
all right uh yeah if if any of this is
true
who knows how much of this is true but
we'll be terraforming like crazy
and then humanity somebody says humanity
is far from god
well so far so far
humanity is far from god but
heading in the right direction
uh mars doesn't have a magnetosphere so
oh good question so the stability of
earth depends on our
magnetic stuff if mars has a different
situation does that make it less stable
good question i don't know and what
happens to the earth when our magnetic
north pole moves because it is
i don't know so he says we didn't
actually make any of that
so we're not god well
didn't we because in physics we know
that something has to be observed to
exist
didn't we make it all because everything
that exists
was observed right so if existing
if observing makes it exist i feel like
maybe
we did make it or at least the
subjective
part of it
somebody says when i watch this on
youtube there's no place for comments
i'm watching the comments on youtube
right now so i've got two screens up
and one of them is showing the comments
as they're coming in from youtube
uh
putting a magneto generator at a
distance to shield
mars would be comparatively easy it
would
that doesn't sound easy all right i'm
just going to look at some of your
comments
because it does seem that when trump is
not in the news the news just
sort of gets kind of boring for a while
observing something does not make it
exist you are misunderstanding the
experiment
well observing something does collapse
the way you form so it
it collapses the possibilities
i always say that's the same thing and
there's some thought that maybe we're
nothing but consciousness
maybe we are somebody says we're
made in the image of god we are not god
well let me ask you this
to god do you think that time
means the same thing that it does to us
question do you think that time means
the same thing to god
as it does to a human probably not
would there be anything that would stop
god from moving either forward or
backward in time
right by definition no god would control
space and time and so god could
move anywhere in space and time so
how do you know that god is in the past
how do you know that god is not your
future
and that the creation of god is what
you're watching right now
how do you know that the sum of humanity
which started at the big bang as a bunch
of nothing
and is now consolidating in various
places and
the individual human minds are now
connected by a vast internet
so that what was a human species of one
person at a time
is now a meta species where we act as
one
with the coronavirus being a good
example and once you act as one
and your power increases to the point
where you can terraform a planet
and create life you know we're going to
create life
right we will be manipulating the gene
structure and creating new species
now fast forward that a thousand years
everything i described is what we can do
right now we can begin to terraform
planets and begin to
make new species out of combinations of
old ones
what will we be able to do in a thousand
years
it's going to be comparable to god
does anybody think that's not true what
humans collectively will be able to do
will be comparable to
everything that we observe that is
attributed to
god we'll be able to do all of it
on a planetary level i suppose you could
argue that the universe is another thing
now what would if you
if you say god is real
why can't i say god is real but god is
not
limited by time the way you are so god
is real in the future
and god is real now in its formative
stage
because many of you believe that a fetus
is a life
even though a fetus can't do much if you
believe that we are evolving into
a god-like form then we're already god
we're just not
good at it yet like a fetus is not good
at being a person
we're kind of a god fetus not god
so i'll just put that out there that if
god is timeless and not affected by time
you're god
so there you go your theory is god is
not tethered
to linear time that is correct and in
physics we do know that the equations
work
forward and backwards right so in
in physics uh the forward
motion of time i don't think is even
necessarily considered
preferred right
i think i've got a phone banging here
somewhere um
all right that's all i've got for you
today go off and have a good day
i know i'm going to and uh we'll talk to
you
tomorrow
all right youtubers wow got a lot of
comments when i said that i was just
watching the comments they just went
zoop
maybe i should just talk about that in
the future
what was the title you wanted to use
i don't know that question anyway my
book god's
debris which is available free
online you could just google it or you
could buy it from amazon
has a fiction version of this
all right that's all i got for now and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
