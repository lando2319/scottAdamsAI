hey everybody
come on in yeah yeah you made it
good for you so far your day is going
great
but i got news for you it's gonna get
better
yeah because you made it to coffee with
scott adams
a lot of people didn't make it there are
people who are working
instead of watching this do you feel
sorry for them
well you should because the people here
are going to have a great time and all
they need is a copper marker glass
attacker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel with any guy and fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called
the simultaneous set and it happens all
over the world at the same time it
doesn't matter your time zone
really amazing how that works and it's
happening
right now go
now my day can start perfectly
ah deep breath
exhale all right you ready for some fun
well i did a comic uh in february i
think it was
that was based on a real life suggestion
and the suggestion was that
zoom calls should have closing credits
and the reason that somebody suggested
they should have closing credits is so
you know when they're done
because people don't know how to end a
zoom call it's like well
okay so there's no
polite way to do it so somebody said why
don't you just
run the closing credits and every
everybody will just say oh i guess it's
over
well it turns out somebody actually
added closing credits
so that's a real thing now i mean it's
still just a joke thing
but sure enough there's a video of
somebody who added funny closing credits
to a zoom call
so that's uh art imitating life and then
life
imitating art and then i'll make a comic
about it again
and then art will imitate life again
so here's a little coincidence for you
uh
economists at goldman sachs sex
sex they have multiple sacks i said
goldman sachs but that would just be one
sack
but there are multiple sacks over there
uh at goldman sachs
they raised their gdp growth
expectations for the u.s economy to
eight percent
for 2021. now if you don't
follow economics
that's a shockingly big number that's
such a big number
that i'm not sure i believe it it i
think it's you know
other economists are down like you know
under five percent
so to think that we would have an eight
percent gdp
when you know two or three is pretty
good three is pretty good
um coming off the uh pandemic though
you've got a little bit more of a
natural bump so
so here's the first part of the news
goldman sachs
is saying that the economy is going to
be great
under biden okay so it's the first
unrelated fact it's just floating out
there it's not connected to any other
news
okay it's just by itself just floating
now unrelated to this in every way
completely separate from the story
we hear leaks today that biden is
planning to raise taxes quite a bit
but that's a separate story floating all
by itself
not connected in any way to this
coincidentally timed story
from goldman sachs who some people might
say
is in the democrats pocket or vice versa
and so if you were a
skeptical kind of a person and you were
looking at the media would you say to
yourself
huh that's a pretty big coincidence
that this highly respected firm goldman
sachs
multiple sacks um
would be giving cover for the
biden tax increase what are the odds
that those two things happened at the
same time by accident
do you think that happened by accident
because if you say to somebody like me
and i'm actually a good example for this
if if you're a poor person and your
government says we're going to raise
taxes on rich people
what do you say oh good raise taxes on
the rich people maybe a little bit more
money for me
from that if you're a rich person
what do you say to the prospect of
higher taxes
well here it gets tricky it depends
it depends because if you're if you're
the kind of rich person who has
enormous wealth already
and the economy is better than usual
that enormous pile will
will grow in value faster than maybe
anything that would happen with your
annual income so if you have a giant
amount of wealth compared to how much
you make every year
and they raise the taxes on that smaller
part the part you make every year
but let's say the bigger part can just
grow with the economy
you still come out ahead but if you're
the kind of rich person who hasn't
accumulated much
wealth but your annual income is really
high
at the moment but let's say you're young
you haven't accumulated that much yet
well then you're just never going to
accumulate as much because they'll get
it as soon as it's made
so there are two kinds of rich people
one kind of rich person is better off
if you have both higher taxes so long as
this goldman sachs kind of a
optimistic look at the economy is
anywhere near uh
near good then the rich people actually
do the best in any kind of a good
economy
so they could pay a little more taxes
and wouldn't know the difference
but the other kind of rich person who
is mostly income is not going to like it
not going to like it all right
there's you knew this was going to
happen there's a pennsylvania woman who
created a deep fake video
to embarrass the rivals of her
daughter's cheerleading team
and i guess the deep fakes of the
teenage
cheerleader girls were showing them an
embarrassing situations
i think there was some nudity or drugs
or something like that
but somebody actually created a real
deep fake
to basically perpetuate a crime
of sorts i don't know if it's
technically illegal but
there you go there's the first one now
of course the people who do this first
are going to get caught
because the deep fakes are not that good
and the people in them are going to say
ah that wasn't me
so it's not exactly a perfect crime but
you can see where this is all heading
pretty quickly here's another story that
makes me miss
uh let's say the the energy and the
uh the entertainment of president trump
you've heard everything that can be said
about meghan markle and harry right
is there anything else anybody could say
that would feel fresh or
new or interesting at this point
right because everything's just been
said what else is there to say
and then we hear that president trump
had weighed in on this question
privately i guess this is being reported
by jason miller or somebody
who said that he talked to him and this
is what miller says the president said
about meghan markle and i'm gonna quote
it
she's no good
i said it and now everybody is seeing it
now
just think just think of this the first
three words
she's no good
as soon as i read that i just laughed
because you don't realize uh how
i don't even know the right word for it
you don't realize how crisp
trump's communication is until he's gone
for a while and then then you see it
again
and then it you're not used to it after
a while and you go oh
that's that's the thing he does
i don't know why but if you sat down and
thought for a year
about what what would be three words
to say about meghan markle they would
sort of
sum it up and be quotable and would
stick in your head
and it would make you laugh after
everybody said so much already
and then you just you you picture the
trump saying it right
because when it's a trump quote you see
the picture of him
and you just see him saying she's no
good
and you say to yourself i think we're
done here
what else is there to say she's no good
now i'm not saying i agree with that
statement i'm just saying
that the president's communication style
really is
inimitable i i don't know why
he can find just the right words that uh
that
just does something to your brain i
don't know how he does it exactly
but it's consistent so in california
here
some children at least in my area are
going back to school in the
hybrid learning environment you know
what that is right
so i guess here they have a choice if
they want they can just stay home and
continue
learning uh from zoom as they have or
they can go
two days a week i guess locally and do
uh ex you know severe social distancing
a few kids showing up in the classroom
with their own little
stations and distance and masks all day
long and stuff
what do you think the local kids say
about that
what do you think is the opinion of the
local kids now the school has opened up
at least a little bit
screw that
[Laughter]
now i can't say that i've done a poll
but i have overheard
i've overheard a variety of
kids talking about it and they're saying
we might as well just zoom until the end
of the year because we're not going to
be able to see our friends
you know you're going to be six feet
away from them you have to wear a mask
all day
and it's duplicative of what you're
doing on the computer
and so the kids just said uh thank you
but no thanks it's just not even worth
it
and when you hear that they have to wear
a mask all day and can't even get
you know within six feet of their
friends
it doesn't look worth it to me it
doesn't look worth it to me at all
so we need to get to the next level um
china is experiencing or did experience
this gigantic
sandstorm being did you see the pictures
of that
did you know that beijing has gigantic
annual
sand storms how many people knew that
was even a thing
so apparently between deforestation and
their proximity to the gobi desert
when the conditions get just right this
enormous
storm of sand piles up
now do you know what the normal
pollution level is in beijing
okay the normal pollution level is
unhealthy
so they added on top of the normal
pollution a sandstorm
and between the two of them basically it
was an
unlivable city for a while i mean people
did
but it was essentially unlivable
now when people talk about china is
going to eat our lunch and their
you know their economy is zooming and
they're going to take over the world and
all that stuff
it does seem inevitable just because of
population
and they're doing they're moving in that
direction so if you were to just
straight line
okay if everything just keeps going the
way it's been going
china dominates the world eventually
um and i would just add this
straight line projections projections
they never work ever the in fact the
only thing you can be sure
won't happen in the future is whatever
the trend is today
if you just straight line any trend and
you take it long enough
you know the short run trends will will
continue but if you take it long enough
they never do it just it's
almost impossible so we don't know what
will happen but
i remember i'm old enough to remember
when we thought the same thing about
japan
so when i was younger you you youngsters
won't
be aware of this but everybody who's in
my age group
will now be nodding their heads at home
and saying oh yeah
we thought japan was going to run the
world because their
their manufacturing was so dominant for
a while that it just looked like
they would suck up all the business from
the united states and it was just going
to be
the future was going to be japan well
what happened
it turns out that japan's system
couldn't grow so they had a little bit
too much
maybe social or cultural friction
no expert but maybe some of it might
have been cultural
some of it might have been the way their
systems and their banking
and everything is set up that there's
just a little bit too much bloat
uh maybe a little corruption i don't
know exactly what's going on over there
but it didn't straight lines they sort
of hit a wall
and then you know things were sort of
stagnant for years
china has this gigantic demographic
problem
but on top of it the only way they can
survive is by destroying their own
environment so they if they want energy
they have to put in coal plants right
if they want to build as many homes as
they need they might need to cut down
their trees
so there's a whole bunch of ways in
which china
is essentially destroying itself to grow
and the chinese system doesn't strike me
as flexible
they do have some advantages because
it's a dictatorship so
if the whole country needs to do
something like clamp down on the
coronavirus they have some advantages
there but they don't really have
flexibility
within the system they have flexibility
at the top
you know so that the bosses can make you
do anything they want
but they don't have flexibility within
the entrepreneurial system right
is what i'm imagining is the problem
and i i compare that to um
the general statement that's always been
true that every empire fails
right through history we don't have any
example of an
empire that lasted forever right the
roman empire was great for a long time
but there he goes you know the um
uh genghis genghis khan and the moguls
mongols uh you know they took over
a quarter of the earth or whatever it
was but then they disappeared
so every time there's some major power
great britain for example
uh you know colonizing all over the
world but then every year since then
sort of
shrinking in territory at least so
the thinking is that the united states
can't possibly dominate forever
because nothing ever does every system
every system collapses under its own
weight it's just
the way everything works but i would i'd
like to add one bit of optimism
i believe and i don't know that this is
confirmed
but i believe that the geniuses who
built
our system you know capitalism plus the
constitution etc
i feel like they built a self-renewing
system
meaning that what our system is today
won't be exactly what it looks like or
how it operates tomorrow because it can
self-correct
and there's just a whole bunch of
self-correcting
stuff in our system that doesn't seem to
be the case
everywhere else and so i would put this
optimistic uh thought out there which is
the united states might be
the first system that could last forever
and the way it would do it is that it's
never the same system in other words
it's
it's evolving with events so as long as
the system is evolving
with events i think it can renew itself
it can cannibalize itself
you know it can uh it can basically just
reinvent itself as it goes
whereas i don't know if the chinese
system can do that there might be
a little bit too much ossification there
so i think that the united states
because of our system maybe even a
little bit because of the culture i'm
not sure
but does have some kind of enduring
advantage we'll see if that
is enough because china has some big
advantages too
so um
tom cotton continues to be one of the
only interesting
people saying things in the news uh
and we you know we're talking about
immigration being whether it's a
tremendous challenge or it's a crisis
now of course the republicans want the
democrats to use that word
use the word say crisis say crisis damn
it
don't keep saying it's a challenge
that's a crisis so then once it's a
crisis
you know they can make more political uh
hey about it
so tom cotton notes this he says uh and
now the biden administration is sending
fema to the border they are by their own
declaration
admitting it's a disaster that's what it
is when you deploy
fema a disaster
and i thought how come he's the first
person to point this out
it's like one of those things where you
hear it and you say oh yeah
that should be the end of the
conversation once you've deployed fema
you can't argue it's not a disaster
right
because fema is literally the group
you send to fix a disaster
that's what they are it's pretty hard to
argue you're sending fema
at the same time you're saying it's not
a disaster so of course this is word
thinking
because what you call it doesn't change
it you know change its nature it's
it's a bad situation no matter what you
call it but i thought that was an
interesting observation
um there's an article in the new york
times
alan fewer f-e-u-e-r
how would you pronounce f-e-u-e-r
fewer fewer maybe
okay we'll go with that he's
he's asking and trying to answer the
question of why the proud boys
despite their long history of promoting
and committing violence
according to allen uh how were they able
to skirt
law enforcement enforcement scrutiny
prior to the storming of the capital so
what is it about the proud boys
that law enforcement would be completely
aware of them
right they're not hiding so law
enforcement knows who they are
they know their whole deal but yet they
were not
they were not really leaned on before
the
this the storming of the capital i guess
they were visited
so law enforcement did visit some of the
leaders and talk to them
but there were you know it wasn't any
any strong enforcement or
suppression or anything like that and
the question is asked
why did they get a pass why is it that
the proud boys
um were given sort of a you know a pat
in the back and
you know okay you know go ahead and
here's my answer to that
the proud boys don't have a larger
ambition
the proud boys sort of like their club
and they like being in it they like
drinking
that's actually literally a big part of
their philosophy is they like to get
together and drink
and they like uh provoking fights
so that they could have fights they
don't they try not to start them in the
sense of punching first
but they like being in the situation
where maybe they could get somebody to
take a punch at them first
and then then they can finish it and
i think to myself there's nothing about
that
that looks like a coup attempt there's
nothing about it
that looks like a national movement you
know they don't seem to be organizing to
change the world they don't seem to be
trying to elect
officials they're not donating money to
a candidate
it just seems like a a
a club of knuckleheads and i say that
lovingly you know
a bunch of knuckleheads who like using
their knuckles
right they like punching stuff they like
drinking
and you know they have something like a
philosophy
so in my view uh
law enforcement not coming down hard in
them is because
it's not it's not antifa antifa
actually wants to destroy the country
that's different you know um
so you could uh this will sound like a
defense of the proud boys and then
somebody's gonna say why are you a proud
boy apologist
i'm not an apologist for anything right
you can say that things have good parts
and bad parts
and that's just talking about it that's
not being an apologist
almost everything has some good parts
and some bad parts
so if you can be an adult we can talk
about that
all right so i don't see the proud boys
as any kind of a
existential threat to the country
not the way antifa would be or or even
neo-nazis i suppose
so the vatican uh causing trouble
uh by being completely consistent to
everything they've said before
so i don't know why it's news but it is
so the vatican decreed monday that the
catholic
church cannot bless same-sex unions
since god quote cannot bless
sin what
let's go on the vatican's orthodoxy
office the congregation for blah blah
blah um
they said they were asked about whether
they can bless gay unions
now they do they do go on and say that
they want full respect and everything
for
the lgbtq population
so they're saying no no we're not saying
anything bad about
gay people they're saying we're only
talking about the institution of
marriage
and they go on um
let's see and they said they distinguish
between the church's welcoming and
blessing of gay people
which it upheld but not their unions
such
since any such sacramental recognition
could be confused with marriage so i
guess they're opposed to
you know any kind of a union that could
be
somewhat similar to marriage
and it says the vatican holds that gay
people must be treated with dignity and
respect
and then they and then they go ahead and
don't treat them with dignity and
respect
but i guess i suppose that's subjective
but they say
the gay sex is and here's the the money
quote here
intrinsically disordered
intrinsically disordered how long did
they have to think
before they came up with those two words
that gay sex
is intrinsically disordered like you'd
have to work pretty hard for that
wouldn't you
to come up with those two words that
nobody maybe nobody's ever used before
about this topic um
and it says catholic teaching holds that
marriage is a lifelong union between a
man and woman
it's part of god's plan as an intended
for
here's here's the important part is
intended for the sake of creating new
life oh
interesting so if you
take their uh argument i'll do a better
job than they do
of their own argument okay so here's how
the catholic church
could have done maybe a better job on
this
so i'm not going to be backing their
opinion i'm just going to say they could
they could have made a better argument
it would have gone like this
that uh the god
is all about creation and god is
apparently concerned or loves people and
wants them to reproduce
and so god is more about blessing
again this is not me saying this i'm
just making an argument that would be a
better argument
so god would be sort of more
pro-anything that was
conforming to the mating process
and uh he would maybe think it's a sin
to do something that works against let's
say the procreation and the
um the growth of humanity
so for example god would be against
murder
because murder reduces the number of
people
who he loves but god would be in favor
of reproduction
because reproduction keeps more people
now i'd never heard
this philosophy before where the the god
view
was being married philosophically to the
mating instinct
had you ever heard that before and yeah
i'm seeing somebody in the comments
saying that
you know life is sacred being part of
the the catholic
uh belief system so um
so yeah the the life is sacred um it's
about
mating it's about reproduction it's
about you know the biology of the
species
so here's here's the part that uh i'd
never heard before
i'd never heard anybody marry the
philosophy of catholicism
with the biology of the mating process
is that common have you heard that
framing before
because i thought it was actually a
productive framing
except that yeah abortion being another
example yeah
so the the catholic church would be in
favor of everything that promotes
making more people and keeping more
people alive
and so far
sounds pretty good right even even if
you disagree with some of the policies
that come out of that it's hard to argue
against the general idea
that catholicism wants to keep everybody
alive and have more of us
like just that sounds good on the
surface
but that unfortunately the side effect
of that is that it
um i think unintentionally demonizes
gay unions to which i say
what does the catholic church think
about people who can't have children
like you know physically biologically
they just can't have children
are they defective are they
sinning or are they in some condition of
it's not their fault
but are they in some kind of perpetual
sin
situation because they're outside of the
mating process
through no fault of their own how about
people who have
aged out of the mating process you're a
certain age you can't have children
anymore
you're a woman let's say if that woman
who can't have children
but has never been married gets married
what does the catholic church say about
that because that woman is getting
married
in an institution which is designed for
the reproduction of people
but she would not in any way be part of
the reproduction because she's already
aged down
let's say she's 60 not not 40 just to
keep it
easy right so how does the catholic
church
reconcile that some people can get
married and it's just fine
and even though they have nothing to do
with reproduction and nothing to do with
mating
because they can't but this other group
of people according to the catholic
church
they're gay and they also want to have
you know something some kind of marriage
situation which has nothing to do with
reproduction
except that they can adopt right
so so i'm just i'm just pushing the
question right so far i've not given you
an opinion
so if you're looking for my opinion it's
not here yet right
so suppose uh the catholic church is
looking at the following
two situations number one a gay couple
get married
and now they're in a better let's just
say they're a better situation
economically and stability wise to adopt
or to artificially inseminate and have a
child
now compare the gay couple who can find
a way to either
support a child who already is here or
to create a new one with science
aren't they part of the banning process
doesn't that put the gay couple
right in the middle of the whole
reproduction thing
except they may be taking care of a kid
who's already born
that seems very catholic to me compare
that again
to the 2 70 year olds who get married
the catholic church says ah this is fine
but
don't plan to adopt because they're 70
and they don't plan to have children
because they're 70. why is that okay
why is one a sin when the gay couple
hypothetically
is you know taking care of children
maybe creating children
with little science involved and the
others are doing nothing for
reproduction
but yet the gay people are the ones who
are outside of the mating
mating process it feels there's an
inconsistency here
now again i'm not catholic so
is it up to me what the catholic dogma
is
no no so the catholicism shouldn't
listen to me
my opinion should have no weight and i
would hope it would have no weight
but i simply point that out i feel like
the catholic church needs
a little bit more work
needs to do the work as they like to say
all right i guess dr fauci is now open
to the idea there's some new studies
showing that at least for school schools
maybe
three feet of distance is enough
so six feet might be too much and fauci
says he's open to that
and they're still collecting data but
preliminarily it looks like the six
foot thing is less important and maybe
three feet would be enough
maybe just in schools don't don't know
yet
but here's my thing how in the world
could three feet be good
if you're if you're just breathing
and i'm just sort of using my
non-scientific brain here
doesn't it seem like if you're talking
to somebody who's three feet away
can't they actually feel your breath
like if you're only three feet away say
three feet
two feet like this if you're this far
you can feel you can feel somebody's
spindle
like they can actually you can feel like
the the spray hitting you in the face
whereas six feet away you can't i'm
thinking to myself
if the data confirms that three feet
is is good enough i've got questions
because if three feet is good enough
there's
something that we've been told that
doesn't quite
track if you know what i mean right
so i tell you if this three feet holds i
want it to hold of course because
that would be better than six feet but
if it does hold and the data supports it
there's something else that we don't
understand about how this thing gets
spread
all right i asked on twitter yesterday
if there were a private company
that could offer to deprogram your child
from whatever occult
programming they're getting in school
would you pay for it if it were
reasonably priced
and overwhelmingly people said yes
now of course that reflects my audience
as much as anything
but i feel as if this is like a
legitimate market opportunity
for somebody to be something like a
tutor
but to be a tutor on how to avoid um
cult awokeness
and i don't think it would take forever
like i think you could hire that tutor
to come in you know twice a year and
just give your kids a little tune-up say
hey kids
it's just 45 minutes i'd like you to
listen to mr johnson
twice a year and he's going to just go
over what you've been told
and then he's going to give you another
view of it so you can see the
filter to look through and you can tell
what's real and what's not
twice a year just a little bit of a
tune-up
really useful i think the other thing
i've been promoting forever is teaching
strategy to kids life strategy the sort
of things you can get from my book kind
of failed almost everything and still
win big
there are others but schools don't
really teach
strategy like what you know should you
have a system
versus a goal how to build a skill stack
et cetera
and i feel like that's a consulting
business too
imagine if you could again just twice a
year
have a tutor come in put your kids in
front of them it could be different ages
because it wouldn't matter that much
and just have them teach you all right
here's the stuff you learn in school
here's the stuff they don't tell you but
if you use these strategies you're
really going to do well
priceless it would be priceless
all right um
have you noticed how often the democrats
get the same thing
i'm going to say wrong but but you might
say different than
republicans and it's so consistent
and i don't hear people talk about it
even though this would be the way to
describe
everything that's happening is that
democrats don't
understand or don't appreciate or don't
recognize
human motivation as being a necessary
maybe the most necessary part
of any system and republicans
consistently get that right
it's the biggest difference it's like
there's a blind spot
now the democrats think the blind spot
is the republicans have no heart
or they're racist or something whereas
the republicans say
you're ignoring the biggest variable
every time it doesn't even matter what
topic you're looking at
every time you get the same thing wrong
which is human motivation you act like
it doesn't it's not a thing
like it doesn't even exist let me give
you some examples
immigration trump got the human
motivation right
because he made it difficult and
unpleasant to come across the border
and so fewer people did the democrats
say hey we want to be kind
so we're going to let anybody any kids
come in and of course the human
motivation was
too many kids and the system is looks
like it's already
broken it's collapsing so
how about socialism socialism is again
getting the human motivation part wrong
because if you let people make more
money and be greedy
they will build amazing businesses and
if you give them no reward whatsoever
for doing extra hard work they won't do
it
again democrats get that wrong the
teachers unions
the motivation is for them to protect
the union
and that means that the children who are
our most valuable asset
even if even if you don't you know love
children economically they're the most
valuable asset for the future
unambiguously
but the democrats created a situation
where there's no competition in schools
because of the teachers unions
so they they squash the competition as
soon as you don't have competition
what is the human motivation of the
people working there
to not do a good job because the pay is
the same
if you do a good job or a bad job
there's no competition so you're not
going to lose
lose out that way what about the minimum
wage
same thing the minimum wage the the
republicans say
hold on if you make this change you can
predict very easily what people will do
companies will hire fewer people you
know just the human motivation will work
through it and
it'll be a problem now i don't agree
with the republican position on this
just to be clear i'm just describing
them
i do think that the country could handle
a higher minimum wage
um if you do it's smart and you do it
differently in different places etc
but i think we could probably handle it
anyway so in every case
um even foreign affairs
you know even trusting iran to do the
right thing
okay iran we'll do the right thing so
you will too
right again they get the human
motivation wrong because iran says
you're gonna you're gonna let us do
whatever we want and not check
we'll do some bad stuff
i i feel as if this label between
republican and democrat
could be scrapped and there are just
some people who believe
human motivation is real and you and you
could that could describe everything
instead of saying are you democrat or
are you republican just say
hey do you believe that human motivation
should be a big factor when you design a
system for society and if somebody says
no they're a democrat
um i guess bill burr
was one of the hosts for the grammys did
part of the presentation
and a bunch of people are complaining
and when i say a bunch of people i mean
artists artists are consistently the
humorous
the humorless group now
if you hire bill burr to
to be part of your program and then bill
burr
mocks something about your program which
i guess he did because he he wasn't
turned on by the piano music
section uh are you
that's sort of on you right if you hire
bill burr and he says something that
offends somebody
you can't say you didn't see it coming
well i didn't see that coming
by the way there's nothing funnier than
watching people call bill burr
racist because he does everything he
does is a little
edgy so it's like right on the edge of
being
you know sexist but not quite and he's
like right on the edge of you think it's
gonna be a little racist
but it's not quite which is where he
gets all of his energy
by walking right up to the line but i
love this fact about
him which he's married to a black woman
and so he's got this situation where
just he just silently does his thing
and everybody complains about you know
hey are you being a racist
and he just sits there married to a
black woman
and that's it that's that's the defense
now i don't think he ever has ever said
that directly
like hey i can't be racist because i'm
married to a black woman
which is not even a thing because of
course you could be the biggest racist
in the world and be
married to a to a black woman there's
nothing that would stop that
but as an argument it's like the most
elegant argument you could make because
you don't even have to say anything
here's my argument nothing
how about my counter argument is nothing
i'm not even going to count argument
i'll just be me
and that's my argument
um have you noticed that all of the
stories turn out to be continuation
stories
remember when trump would create new
news
you'd wake up and he's like oh what do
you do now it'd be like this whole new
story
about a new thing but today all of the
stories are just
more so we have biden
continues not to give press conferences
54 days
we continue to talk about his declining
mental mental state there's no
news per se but there is more of it
uh immigration is just
getting worse cuomo
gets a new accuser every few days and
more people have been asked about
commenting on it but it's the same story
there's just more of it how about the
vaccination rollout
it's not really new there's just more of
it how about the
comedians say something offensive
well is that new not really there's just
another one so
the biden the biden administration has
turned into
a no news isn't that weird
that that the idea of news just stopped
sharon osbourne got in trouble for uh
i guess supporting pierce morgan and his
comments about megan merkel and that
turned into
you must be a racist and blah blah blah
blah
and then she had to of course do her
statement
in which she said so here's sharon
osbourne
there are very few things that hurt my
heart more than racism
so to feel associated with that spun me
fast i am not perfect
i am still learning like the rest of us
and will continue to learn
listen and do better and i was comparing
that to
chris harrison's public statement of
apology
and i thought to myself i'm going to
need to write one of these
sooner or later i'm going to be doing
one of these public apologies i don't
know for what
but it feels likely right oh by the way
youtube just took down two of my videos
they were both from january but they
took them off
and the reason giving is that the videos
they say
promoted false election claims
now if you've been watching me do you
think that i made
any false election claims
you you've been watching me for a while
right and you know how carefully i word
everything
do you believe that there were any
false claims about the election in those
videos two of them and they were taken
down
no they weren't no because i don't make
those claims
nor do i think anybody should indeed
i could not agree with youtube
anymore i don't think people should be
promoting false claims of elections and
so
i've never done it you'd agree you've
all watched it you've never seen me even
promote anything that was even sketchy
right in fact i do the opposite more
than anything
i tell you that the claims are
pretty much
exclusively i tell you that the claims
don't have substance
i've probably mentioned that the
statistics need to be explained but that
there's no direct evidence of fraud
so and what youtube said in a statement
oh let me
read it to you i'll tell you how youtube
described this to me and i'll tie it
back to
sharon osborne in a moment so
uh here's their actual statement
um says you know hi scott adams we want
to let you know that our team reviewed
your content
and we think it violates our spam
deceptive practices and scams policy
we know you may not have realized this
was a violation
of our policies here's the important
part we know you may not have realized
it
now that's true and the real the reason
i did not realize it is because it
didn't happen
in no reality did this happen in any
reality
now do they point do they point to the
thing i said
so that i could know next time oh don't
say that
because whatever it was that i said
that's the thing they're keying on so
i'd like to avoid they don't tell me
what it is
it's just somewhere in a video they had
lots of different topics
okay and
they said we've uh it says
so we're not applying a strike to your
channel
so they're not going to put it on my
permanent record
because they think i might not have
realized
that i had violated their their policy
that seems pretty good right if if they
admit they don't know i did it
intentionally
so they're not putting a strike on my
record they're just getting rid of the
videos
does that seem reasonable pretty fair
right
if this were the only thing in the world
even i would say
oh i would disagree with that opinion
but that's reasonable i'm not getting
any kind of a permanent strike
they're just doing a little editing no
big deal and they're older videos anyway
but here's the question if i got
these taken down and even they know i
couldn't tell that i had violated the
policy
what happens when i do it again
right because now i've been warned
have i not been warned this is exactly
what this
is it's a warning and they're saying
we're not going to give you a strike
because you probably didn't know you did
anything wrong
but what happens the next time the next
time
can they not say we warned you i feel
like they could
because they did warn me but they didn't
tell me what it was that i did
so i don't have the option of avoiding
it
because i don't know what it was now
do you see do you see what's happening
now add this to the fact that the
algorithm has obviously tightened up on
me as well
so that you know the monetization and
everything from the channel just plunged
so doesn't that look like a setup to you
like an obvious setup i feel as if
they're
they're they're pushing me in a
situation where i will accidentally
cancel myself and i'll never know i did
it
i'll just be cancelled and then they'll
say well this is your third strike
to which i'll say about what
you didn't even tell me what the other
strikes were about i mean you gave me a
category
but you didn't tell me what i said that
violated that category
i have no idea and honestly i don't even
have a guess
i have no guess why i got censored
think about that think about being
censored
and you don't even know why except for a
category i just don't know what i said
about it
yeah and they went back two months to
find it what's that tell you
so every time one of my videos goes up
it gets a
down vote the moment it comes on
meaning that there are people who spend
their full time
just trying to demonetize my channel now
i don't
know that they're anybody except trolls
but there's somebody whose job is trying
to make my voice
less they're spending like time every
single day
working on decreasing my voice think
about that
so i would say the odds of me eventually
getting cancelled from
uh youtube are a hundred percent
unless i stop saying the kinds of stuff
i say
which i don't plan to do so we'll see if
i get cancelled i'll be on the locals
platform subscription platform where i
am now with the stuff you don't get to
see
and by the way i'm gonna i keep saying
do a uh
thing on locals about reframing it's
gonna be the best thing i've ever done
and i i think that's actually true
because i've just been
you know sort of working on the outline
for it and when i looked at it together
it's really going to be life-changing so
not some probably a lot of people who
watch that content
it's just going to completely change
your life it's actually that powerful
anyway back to sharon osborne so she did
her little statement of contrition and
how she's going to listen and do better
i thought i better write mine in advance
so i wrote up a little
first draft so i'd like to read to you
my statement i will be reading
when i get canceled because that seems
inevitable i don't know for what
so uh please help me on the first draft
okay so this is when i get caught
or cancelled for whatever bad thing i'm
sure i'll do in the future
i will say the following it doesn't
matter what it is
uh here's my statement i'm a deeply
flawed human
really just a pile of organic crap
that is barely sentient i must learn to
listen and do better
i am committed to doing the hard work of
examining all of my flaws
as described by my critics and i will
force myself to be unhappy
until my brain is free of all bias
and i can clearly see myself as broken
and unworthy of life itself
i beg my critics who are already
operating at a higher level of moral
standards
to pity me for my wretchedness and evil
and to help me improve by spitting on me
in public whenever they see me
i am committed to a path of
self-improvement that will with lots of
hard work
make me barely acceptable to proper
thinking people
i dedicate my entire life to the mission
of pleasing my critics
who are justifiably uncomfortable with
my very existence
in summary i am a shitty person and i
will spend my days
thinking of nothing else but my
unworthiness which i now
understand extends to the molecular
level of my being
please adjust your opinion of me to be
as low as my opinion of myself
i plan to issue public statements of
apology for being me
until the end of my days which i think
we all agree
should come sooner than later
now uh this is just the first draft i
need to tighten it up a little bit
i don't feel that i insulted myself
enough
um i need to add a little bit more
bagging
right gotta add a little more begging so
but that's a start
and i would suggest that all of you
start working on your your statements
of uh contrition and apology because
it's coming for you
you don't want to be you don't want to
be caught off guard
in fact when i get canceled i think i'll
just have this in my back pocket
[Applause]
and i'll be like uh mr adams
you've said some terrible things uh do
you have any comments
do i yeah here i do
thank god i did all this work and i'm
glad uh yeah i have a statement for that
uh statement begins uh
i'm a deeply flawed human and i'll just
read my statements
and then people say whoa you carry that
with you carry with me yes
i memorize this every day i i read
i chant it i actually go outside and i
chant
my apology that's how serious i am to
doing the work
a lot of you you're not serious about
doing the work
i do the work and that's why
i'm a better person than all of you
because i hate myself
more now you understand that right
i hate myself more than you hate
yourself
which makes me a better person and
if you add to that that i'm white and
male and of a certain age
that self-hatred is really the key to
moral acceptability
so if you can find a way to deeply
deeply despise yourself
that will give you some moral clarity
all right that is my show for today
i think you agree it's the best one ever
until
tomorrow and
i'm glad you like that some people are
laughing uh
can i get a coffee so he wants a copy oh
yeah
maybe i'll post that i may post that
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you a little bit later
all right youtubers good first draft
thank you
i'll keep working on that and
i will see you tomorrow
