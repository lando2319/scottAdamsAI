hey everybody
come on in here you know what time it is
it's time yeah it's time for coffee with
scott adams
let me adjust you a little bit here just
to make you feel comfortable
and if you would like to enjoy
the full pleasure of coffee with scott
adams and the simultaneous hip what do
you need
well not much not much at all you need a
copper mug of glass a tank or jealousy
stein a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip
and watch how good this is go
yeah was i lying no it was just as good
as i told you it would be
and it is every single time
sort of a miracle well you might notice
some bandaging on me
um my cat boo was in the
bed last night and i was awake in the
middle of the night and i thought you
know
you know it would be fun i'd like to pet
my cap
in the middle of the night and it might
relax me
because you know what is nice and
relaxing if you can't sleep
petting a cat oh so relaxing
so i reached over to pet my cat and vu
is a very
friendly cat she she actually laid on
her back like this
and just said ah give it to me and i
put my hand on her belly and i started
scritching it as i
as i do she i think she learned that
from snickers she learned to
expose her belly for belly rubs from the
dog
and i'm rubbing the cat and then for no
reason
except reasons which um
reason which the cat knows the cat
decided to
grab my hand and arm with
every claw in her body and grab it like
this
and now i've got a cat that's attached
to my arm with every single claw
and i'm trying to talk her out of it as
her claws are starting to penetrate the
surface
and i'm thinking i don't know if i can
talk you out of this whatever this
is but it's sure starting to hurt
and i'm thinking to myself how do i get
out of this trap
because if i try to rip my arm away it's
just going to be blood everywhere
if i try to wait it out she doesn't look
like she's getting more calm
she looks like she's getting more angry
and so i tried to talk around of it for
a while
using all of my persuasion tricks hey
kitty
why don't you let go of my arm wouldn't
that be great
hey hey look over there something over
there
you don't even need to think about my
arm anymore but it turns out the cats
are uniquely resistant
to my persuasion really the only only
mammals that are
you should see me with a wood shack
woodchuck or an aardvark
totally persuasive but a cat
nothing well long story short
my sleeping ended at about two am
in a uh in a flurry of bloodshed
uh that would be uh
matched only by the million mega march
apparently uh but i survived
all right um
so here's some potentially good news
michael mina reports this by a tweet
apparently slovakia is going to do a
massive
testing program so they're going to do
rapid tests
which are not the kind you usually see
the rapid ones are the cheap ones that
may not be as
accurate as the expensive ones but if
you do enough testing they don't have to
be that accurate you can still
test your way to the end of the pandemic
that is the hypothesis but they're going
to try it
and they're already seeing huge gains
from this
now why is this important it's important
because
as i tell you a b testing
is always the right thing to do so if
you can test something
in a small way and just find out if that
idea works
do it do it every time if you can test
it
test it and that's what slovakia is
doing for the world and for themselves
so it could be that in you know a few
short weeks
we will know if this concept of rapid
testing with
cheap dispose i assume they're
disposable tests
that don't require equipment i think
that's true
but we'll know that soon so that could
be actually great news
we'll see um
here's the weirdest thing have you ever
noticed
that new facts don't change people's
opinions i feel like
once people uh you know dig into an
opinion you could show them
any counter fact and it wouldn't make
any difference
just people don't change their opinions
and here's here's a perfect example
so a month ago
78 million people approximately
believed that trump's supporters and
trump
were basically fascists and you know
that he's a fascist and
his supporters are fascist supporters
and that fascism would break out after
the election
if trump lost and so the thinking was
from 78 million
democrats that trump supporters would
riot or
try to keep him in office despite
a vote count that went the other way
has that happened yet where is it
now you would think that if
such an important belief that that trump
would never leave
office and you know he's he's uh he's
going to be a fascist and the military
will be called out in that
now that there's absolutely no
indication of that
there's absolutely no indication the
million
the million maguma march
certainly wasn't violent in terms of the
trump supporters starting anything there
was violence but
i think it was almost all started by the
other side and
there's just no evidence that anything
like
some kind of violent militia overthrow
is going to happen
right why are people saying
the word camera
i'm seeing a bunch of people yell camera
on
in the uh comments
why are you doing that
you're saying something's blocked
let's try that is that it
okay i guess you're happier now
all right well i guess we're all good
now
so will the democrats uh reassess their
thinking
when they realized that uh
everything that they thought about trump
supporters being fascist and there's
going to be a
armed militia take over if trump doesn't
win on votes
none of it happened none of it looks
like it's even
slightly going to happen
do they change their opinions
not really they're not really they're
not going to change their opinions
and watching that is fascinating now
a month ago also people were
telling me that
that i was crazy to think that the polls
were way off and the the thinking was
oh yeah maybe they were off a bit in
2016.
but surely they have fixed that by now
and i'm completely right how many of the
many democrats and others who said to me
disgust has got that many polls
they can't be that wrong i mean look at
them if it were one poll
yeah i mean one poll could be wrong but
scott scott scott
the cult that you have you belong to
the kool-aid you're drinking how do you
believe that
all those polls are wrong
you idiot you idiot all of those polls
really scott every one of those polls
they're all wrong right is that what
you're saying
because because i'm gonna check with you
after the election scott
because you're i mean that's crazy
all those polls all those professional
pollsters
they're all wrong
[Laughter]
haha and they were all wrong
except for rasmussen and
uh trafalgar and i think one or two
others right
but the the mass of pollsters
were in fact completely wrong on a lot
of big stuff
now do they notice that
and say well okay we were wrong about
trump getting elected in the first place
2016 and uh and we were certainly wrong
about the polls
this time no
no now what do they say when i make the
following claim
that there was massive fraud
and it's obvious and that
history will eventually record not yet
but the history will eventually record
that trump won
even though i am not predicting he will
necessarily
take office for a second term because
that's a separate question
now and and what do the what do the
democrats and the critics say to me when
i make this
yet another outlandish claim
do they say oh wait a minute this is the
guy who keeps making outlandish
claims that turn out to be right way
more often than we think
statistically is possible because i've
made a lot of outlandish claims
that have that have happened exactly as
i claimed
now do they do that no they say this
time
this time scott you're crazy and here
are the arguments that i'm getting
and they're they're so bad that they're
funny um
here's one where i i've been saying that
people should wait a couple weeks to
make sure that all the
claims have been packaged up and
presented
and what i've been saying is that what
the courts have seen so far
most of it has been rejected i guess
what they've seen so far is not the good
stuff
and that the early initial court cases
in my opinion
probably were stalling tactics to try to
make it
seem as though something was happening
while they get their better arguments
together
together so this is what somebody said
to me on twitter today
that telling people to quote wait two
weeks for data
is something that only cults say
that's right there's somebody who
believes
that by me saying oh we should have the
information in about two weeks
that i have uh tipped my hand because
that's how
cults talk because i know you didn't
know this but
the only people who use calendars cults
the only people who schedule things
turns out it's just cults and i didn't
know that
because here i was looking at my
calendar and making a schedule
estimate and i didn't realize that
that makes me identified as obviously a
cult member
i'd like to show you my tattoo but i
don't want to take off my pajamas
so that was one thing
here's here's another thing that
somebody argued
scott scott scott let me let me explain
this to you
scott because i don't think you
understand how the world works
it's funnier with a little condescension
on it
scott don't you know that all the
democrats
know the following is true if they were
to
if they were to try to do some fraud in
this election
and it was enough fraud to win
they know they would get caught they
know they would get caught if it were
that much fraud
and also scott scott scott
once they got caught it would be worse
for democrats than if they had never
treated in the first place
so the only logical way it could go
for democrats say my critics
is that they would never cheat they
would not cheat
because it's so obvious that if they did
they'd get caught
because they'd have to cheat a lot and
that would be worse for the party in the
long run
pretty good thinking so
here's my counter argument when i was a
bank
teller one of the things the fbi taught
me
is that bank robbers get caught 95
percent of the time
95 of the time bank robbers get caught
do you know how common bank robberies
are
well if i told you that bank robbers get
caught 95 percent of the time
what would you assume about how many
people rob banks
not many right because it'd be the worst
crime you could ever commit
why would you do a crime when you've got
a 95 percent chance
of going to jail and the answer is
crime bank robberies are so common
that if you work as a bank teller in san
francisco
or at least when i was a bank teller
maybe it's changed
that there would be a bank robbery
almost every day
in san francisco almost
every day just in san francisco
as well as almost every other large city
now lots of times the bank gets robbed
and you don't even know what happened
because they just are talking to the
teller the teller hands over some money
you know they have a gunner they say
they have a gun so you don't even notice
if the bank gets robbed now the reason
that 95 percent get caught
even though 95 of bank robberies
do not get solved is that bank robbers
keep stealing
until they get caught they all do
because why wouldn't you you rob a bank
you walk out with a bunch of money it
took you five minutes
and nobody's chasing you you're like uh
that was a little too easy
all right i'll do this again so bank
robbers always do it again until they
get caught
so if you were cheating in elections
and you had ever gotten away with it on
a small scale
do you think somebody's going to try a
little more yeah maybe next time
ramp it up a little bit yeah of course
because
as long as it works you're always going
to get more of it
and we have plenty of examples of local
cheating
where we assume we haven't caught all of
it so
we know that there are people who cheat
now here's the thing
if there were only one democrat in the
world
literally just one would you know for
sure
if that one democrat would cheat an
election
if that one democrat had the opportunity
actually you wouldn't know that because
some people are honest
or some people have more fear of getting
caught
so if there were only one democrat who
could cheat in the election
maybe they do maybe they don't you
wouldn't really know and in fact i might
even give them a
benefit of a doubt and say yeah you know
probably not
but suppose 78 million democrats are
involved
and hundreds or maybe thousands of them
have the opportunity
to cheat do you think that all of the
thousands of people
who could cheat all have the same
mental process and they all say nah
it's not worth it well have you met
humans
humans are very different there's no
crime that
you can you can you can name any kind of
crime
you can get humans to do it if you have
enough
people do do humans not do crimes
because they might get
caught nope they do those crimes anyway
the most human thing in the world is to
do crimes
anyway even though there's a pretty good
chance of getting caught
and then here's the funniest part to say
that they couldn't do something so big
without it being
obvious to which i say
it is obvious it is obvious
do you really think the bill that joe
biden got 78 million votes
that's kind of obvious
did you really believe and by the way
i'll need a fact check on this
so give me a fact check on this that
the only places that joe biden
outperformed hillary clinton
were in the four swing cities you know
the big cities and the four swing states
is that true is it true that the only
place he outperformed hillary clinton
and the only place that trump
underperformed
just happened to be the very same four
cities
that made the difference huh they just
happened to be in the swing states
and that all of them had a uh
middle of the night swing toward biden
now if anybody thinks that the
uh the fraud is not obvious i would say
what are you looking at
because it looks kind of obvious to me
let me tell you what else is obvious
and by the way when i say it's obvious
that doesn't mean it's proven
because you can say well it's obvious
that the covington kid was
starting this trouble and then you learn
more about it you know
okay it was obvious it looked obvious
just wasn't true
so there are certainly things that can
look obvious and just not be true
but if you ask me as a judgment call
purely subjectively without having to
you know show you the votes and counting
them up and
without doing the data analysis in my
citizen opinion it's obvious
so to my critic who says it would be
obvious if they
cheated that much i say oh well it is
i can see it does that mean i'm right
no but it's obvious
it could be i could be wrong but i see
it
i mean that's what all obvious is you
can see it and i can definitely see it
don't know if i'm right for sure
now i also back i also rely for my
opinion on the fact that
it's possible to cheat we know that
because there are lots of people went to
jail for it we know it's possible
and when software is involved is it
possible to cheat
yes yes it's possible to cheat whenever
software is involved wherever there
are paper ballots involved is it
possible to cheat
yes yes it's totally possible
is there a reason that texas did not
buy the dominion voting system software
yes is because texas said if we have
this software
it would be possible for somebody to
cheat that's why they didn't get it
so if something is possible
and not really that hard because you
know we have enough history with
software and with pieces of paper we
know how to cheat
and the stakes are high so high that
half of the country thinks hitler might
get elected
if the stakes are that high and you
don't know a lot of people have gone to
jail for
that particular crime you don't
personally know them
somebody says scott is very good at
fallacy well that's a dumb
comment
do you think you could add a little bit
to that what fallacy
what's that you know you've got you've
got a few more characters there
go make your point see if you can make
your point
because i don't think you have one um
anyway so my argument is that where you
can have fraud and there's a high upside
and a low downside for getting caught
you always have fraud always a hundred
percent of the time
so anybody who thinks there's no fraud
in this election
it's like you've never met humans have
you met
humans uh
all right there was a million million
meg of march
yesterday in dc um
i don't know that they hit the million
mark might have been closer to a
10 000 something like that still a lot
of people
but i feel as though there may have been
three to five million people there
and i say that just because a lot of a
lot of trump supporters like to wear a
camouflage gear
so i don't know if they're going to show
up on photographs
could be there were 10 10 000 people who
weren't wearing
camouflage gear and that's all we could
see in the photographs
so you know could be wrong
did you see the video there's a video
that's uh
fake news that was debunked and then i
then i debunked the debunk and it goes
like this
so there was a some antifa guy with a
bullhorn
uh yelling at uh trump supporters to get
out of here
and one of the trump supporters uh went
over and at least
we see it on the video and pushes him
over
and then pushed him again and maybe he
tried to kick him or something
couldn't tell and
soon after that somebody came and hit
that trump supporter now
andy now has a video of the trump
supporter getting hit
fairly violently from behind you know
didn't see it coming
and then somebody else said hey hey andy
andy no
that's a fake video it's out of context
if you saw the whole context you would
see that guy who got hit
was the one who pushed the guy with the
with the megaphone
and therefore he was instigating the
trouble
right except
the guy he hit was assaulting him
so here's my take on it
the word assault and you you lawyers and
police people can do a fact check on me
the word assault doesn't mean you hit
somebody assault means that you have
threatened them
or done something aggressive and here i
don't know the exact words
but you've done something aggressive and
threatening to a person
short of actually physically affecting
them
if somebody takes a bullhorn and follows
you around in a public area
yelling with the bullhorn which is
you know an unpleasant experience if
you're close to it and they're yelling
you to get out of a public space for
which you have every right to be
is that assault i think it is
right isn't it i would say that the guy
with the bullhorn
was guilty of assault because he wasn't
using the bullhorn
simply to be louder in public he was
using it
to harass because it's an unpleasant
experience to be close to that sound
so i would say that was assault now
the trump supporters uh response to that
i don't know the the legality of where
self-defense comes in or where it
doesn't
so i don't have an opinion of whether
the trump supporter or alleged
trump supporter was in the wrong or not
because what he did looked very close to
being proportionate
meaning if somebody puts a bullhorn in
your face
and you push them over and they fall
backwards you know
onto the ground have you responded in a
way that's proportional
i don't know the answer that so and i
don't know if the
courts would see that as a crime because
i guarantee you that if somebody comes
up to me and gets close enough
with a bullhorn i would push them over
because that would be assault and i
would feel that it was self-defense
people can't walk right up to your face
and bullhorn you
right now you could argue ah well if
he's
10 feet away is that assault
but what if he's five feet away what if
he was five feet away
but now he's ten feet away and he's
heading toward you where is it
where does assault come in you know
where's the line
i just know that if i were on a jury i
wouldn't be convicting
the guy who pushed him over so
uh so that's a fake edit
so andy knows edit i would say it was a
fake edit
because it didn't show how the things
started but even how the thing started
is a fake edit itself in this case i
would say incomplete
because it's just when the video started
i doubt anybody
faked it i think they just didn't turn
it on until that
point yeah there's potential for your
damage as somebody's saying etc
so you can't believe anything that you
see even
on video nbc news reported
that at least two people have been
arrested for simple
assault during today's demonstrations
and they said it's unclear if those
arrested were trump supporters or
counter-protesters
huh i wonder
who would start trouble at a
an event that had antifa and trump
supporters
50 50 you think 50
50 chance it was either one yeah i think
it's it's very unclear
the the lack of clarity in the story is
is quite sensational
i i don't know who i could have been who
would start the trouble
all right att is reportedly uh
although there's uh i don't think this
is official but people are rumored
rumors say that att is looking to sell
cnn so att owns cnn
which can't be it can't be good for your
brand
because half the country hates you for
it and they're thinking of selling them
but the problem is who the hell would
buy it
you know there's talk of jeff bezos
buying it which would actually be
brilliant
because uh if just jeff bezos combined
the washington post and cnn it's a
pretty strong package
just as the wall street journal and fox
news
having the same ownership with murdoch
is good synergy so i actually if i were
jeff bezos i would look at that pretty
seriously
so i don't know if he'll do it but
it would make sense in his portfolio
and so we'll see if that happens um
you know there's uh the big the big news
trending
is that people are saying that uh trump
has conceded
now they're saying that because he
tweeted and he started with the
the words he won talking about biden
before he went on to complain that the
election was rigged
he's saying he only won because the
election was rigged
so he doesn't think he lost lost and he
still thinks that
you know that can be reversed so the
president was complaining that people
interpreted that as a concession but
here's what i think might happen
i think that one of the things that you
can see clearly is that
if trump is prevented from office
whether he gets enough votes or not i
think the press can keep him out of
office
he will realize that the press is the
real power in this country
and the only way he can get promoted
from president would be to be a media
mogul
i saw somebody say presidents come and
go but rupert murdoch stays
you know the idea is that rupert murdoch
is is more powerful than all the
presidents because they can come and go
but rupert murdoch's still there still
doing what he does
and so i wonder if
trump uh either conceded or
you know decided not to be president or
he just couldn't be president because it
didn't work out
would he start a news media entity
i think he would it would make perfect
sense
right people would watch it it would be
a good investment
and i think he would have more power not
less
imagine imagine the republican party
with a trump who's an outside voice
but the actual politicians don't have
the baggage of trump
it's pretty good isn't it you know if
you imagine
let's say just pick your favorite
uh republican whoever that is in your
mind
they don't have any trump baggage but
they might have very similar policies to
trump
and then outside in the outside world
you would have trump adding air cover
and doing all the provocative stuff
so the politicians don't have to it
would be really strong
and it would put trump sort of
in control of the republican party
without the trouble of being the
the president it feels like a promotion
so
i don't know that he would be unhappy
if he doesn't have a second term i think
he might be happy starting a media
empire
that might that might be a better deal
if i were him i'd be thinking about it
all right
um here's uh
all right uh it looks like uh there's a
lot of
assassinating going on over in iran
and if you if you read jake novak's
stuff and you should you should follow
jake novak on twitter
um his his theory is that we have an
insider in iran
meaning the intelligence agencies do or
or israel does
and so they know where the high value
targets are and they're assassinating
and blowing things up
and that iran's having a tough time and
the report is that
there's an assassination in iran of
the number two al-qaeda guy
now the beauty of this assassination
because everybody assumes that israel
did it
that's generally assumed the beauty of
that assassination is that
uh iran doesn't want to admit that they
had the number two al-qaeda guy
free in in iran so they can murder this
guy
and they can't really complain it's sort
of a perfect crime
but i was reading the story and i
thought to myself you know
how do you really know that it was this
guy
because iran is claiming it wasn't this
guy it was some other guy they're
claiming got killed
and i go how do you know it's really
this this number two al-qaeda guy
and then at the very end of the story
they say that the murder came
on the exact day of the year
as this guy was rumored in 1998
to have done a terror attack so it looks
like they picked the date
to be a meaningful date because that's
the date that this guy
allegedly launched a terror attack and
they killed him on that date
so that sure looks like a little uh
a little kiss on the cheek from israel
doesn't it
um did you see the
million mega march people uh chanting
uh f fox news
the uh it does look like the the
pushback
to fox news is uh just it
might be real i don't know we'll see
um i said i see you uh prompting me to
talk
about sydney powell and release the
kraken
so cindy powell i don't know a ton about
her
um i think i noticed that she's
following me on on twitter
and vice versa um but
i'll tell you my impression my
impression is you wouldn't want to be on
the other side
of sydney powell do you get the same
impression
you know you see some lawyers and you
say to yourself well you know they're
probably a pretty good lawyer
but you see sidney powell and you know
if you even see her just talk for
five minutes on tv and you come away
thinking
i wouldn't want to be on the other side
of that all right
there's some serious firepower involved
there yeah so she was
she is flynn's lawyer
and she seems quite convinced that the
evidence exists
that this uh election was stolen
and she's part of that team and she said
that trump is going to
release the kraken
and i even like that i like the fact
that she is
echoing that um
all right here here's the
uh here's something that i've changed my
mind on a little bit
and it goes like this you know how trump
gets blamed for maybe
sort of semi or even not semi maybe
directly
encouraging the physical violence
from his supporters so for example in
rallies he would
joke about roughing up the the critics
at the rallies and people said no
you're encouraging violence and you know
he said
other things that this sort of feel like
he's maybe encouraging a little bit of
violence and then he said this in a
tweet
he said uh uh antifa scum
which is pretty direct he goes anti-foss
gum
ran for the hills today when they tried
attacking the people at the trump rally
because those people aggressively fought
back antifa
waited until tonight when 99 percent
will go on to attack innocent
maga people dc police get going do your
job don't hold back
now doesn't it sound like he's
encouraging
trump supporters to get physical in the
streets
it feels like that right i mean kind of
directly
and there was a time when i would have
said oh that's a bad idea
that's about it you don't want to ever
encourage violence
because that could be so misinterpreted
so easily it could
could get out of hand but i've changed
my mind on this
and i've changed my find this way you
can't control the country until you can
control the streets
and if the police are not going to do it
then whoever does control the streets
eventually they can control the country
so the president has made it very clear
that he's okay
with republicans literally physically
engaging with antifa and black lives
matter
on the streets and
i support that i support that
now i don't support violence i only ever
support
self-defense okay so let me say that as
clearly as possible
only self-defense but
it may be necessary for there to be a
counter force
on the streets and if it's not the
police and of course i
police are first choice right don't we
all prefer the police
but if the police are not there to
maintain some balance in the country you
do need to control the streets
so i think i would agree with the
president
being let's say encouraging of people
who
stood their ground and did not give up
their right to free speech on the
streets
so i guess i'm gonna i'm gonna support
him completely
on that but as long as you don't start
the trouble
i'm on your side um
let's see what else we got going on here
do you think that people would not cheat
in the election
because they would be afraid of getting
caught
it just isn't a thing is it because
there's always somebody who's willing to
take the chance
especially if you think you're stopping
hitler which is what they thought
all right um here's where i think the
democrats might have a blind spot
my guess is that there was massive
cheating
in the election that's that's my opinion
if there was massive cheating i
doubt that it was organized completely
meaning i doubt that all the people who
cheated
if such people exist i doubt they had a
meeting
or you know zoom call where they said
all right you do this
we'll do this because if they had
they would have cheated you know just
enough to win and there would be
you know no extra anything but with 78
million votes for biden
which i don't think anybody believes
really i don't think anybody believes
that number
but that's what's reported uh
it's really obvious that uh
that something happened here right with
that many votes
i mean you don't know for sure
maybe maybe people disliked trump so
much
that they came out in those numbers but
here's what i think
i think that all the individual pockets
of cheaters
not knowing how much anybody else was
going to cheat
dialed it up on their own little
cheating to whatever they could get away
with
and it would be more than they'd ever
done before so i think what happened is
nobody knew
what would be the total number of all
the cheating
and when it got to 78 million i feel
like all the people who were involved in
cheating
allegedly hypothetically
are saying to themselves oh the higher
this biden total vote gets
the more obvious it is that everybody
cheated everywhere
so i feel as though they over cheated
and it's because they couldn't
communicate with all the cheaters
there wasn't any safe way to do that or
any practical way
and everybody just cheated to the
maximum and the way you see that is in
the
the cumulative number that's what i
think
there's a report that joe biden's cancer
charity
spends all of its money on staff
salaries
and zero money went to
research grants now that's the story
but if you've ever seen a story that
just screams of fake news it's probably
this one
all right now you know that if there was
some big embarrassing story about joe
biden out there i'll tell you
you know i'd report that but this feels
like
maybe bs as in i don't know the details
but i'll bet
that if you looked into his cancer
charity you might see
that they never intended to do research
grants and maybe
the staff was doing the work of whatever
the work is supposed to be
and maybe this is exactly the way they
set it up and maybe it's operating
exactly the way it's supposed to
and maybe they never intended this
charity to give research grants
i don't know do you know
i mean i don't know so it could turn out
that this is exactly the way it's being
reported that there's something sketchy
going on
but probably not
probably not if i had to bet on it
i'd say 70 chance you'll find out later
there's no problem here
just guessing and that's because it
falls into this category of news
that when you first see it it looks
terrible but probably you're going to
find out more and it's not
quite the way it looks so you know i can
be wrong
on that or anything else
what's the link to the bill whittle
analysis don't know bill whittle
um are all charity scams
no i don't think so
all right just looking at your comments
somebody says it's believable it's
believable but it doesn't necessarily
have to be
fraud or crime it could be just the way
they set it up
we don't know what they're doing there
yeah the
dominion software thing is looking
interesting so i saw
reports and the reports i'm seeing i
don't know that you could trust them
but there's reports of dominion people
key employees being you know antifa
friendly
or clinton friendly or some democrats
have an investment
i'm not sure any of that is too solid at
this point
but i'll tell you what is fair it is
fair to say that whoever are the key
employees
at these election software places they
have strong opinions about who should be
president
and that alone should should make them
eligible for maximum
scrutiny and apparently that's not
happening
uh where is bobilinski yeah he just sort
of disappeared didn't he
uh bill maher got somebody says bill
margot owned i don't know about that i
haven't seen the show
but uh i did see bill maher
uh trying to encourage democrats to be
less
stupid which was fun to watch
and i was watching bill maher rip into
the the democrats
and i thought how much would i enjoy
having democrats you know in the
presidency
so you'd have somebody to uh criticize
all day long
because criticizing's easy criticizing
is the easiest thing
so i feel like it would be easier with
the biden presidency
yeah so my guess is that the vote
has been stolen history will report that
it was stolen
but that trump may not be able to serve
a second term
he may choose not to or he may just find
this now possible
because the fake news may would just
make it impossible
where is the report of the mobile ballot
printing
feature don't know about that
how do you audit software and hardware
well there are people who know how to do
that stuff i can't give you a detailed
answer but
you could look at logs that you could
run test scripts
and you could do basically that
all right um that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers somebody says should
trump
leave twitter for parlor you know i have
a parlor account
but i spend some time over there and the
energy is so low because it just doesn't
have the fighting and the
you know just the numbers of people so
i suppose you know it could grow over
time until it's
something but i don't want to be where
they're
where there's not both sides the thing i
like about twitter
is that both sides are there somebody
says
dr shiva got debunked somebody in the
comments says that
if you have a link to what you are
alleging
i would like to see it i don't know if
he's been debunked but
i'd like to i'd like to see it if
somebody thinks he has
and again if i see dr shiva's claims
or i see somebody saying that they're
debunking them
i don't know that i could tell the
difference
um the media academy are real political
power the cathedral they call them yeah
i'm saying the same thing as that
comment uh i'm saying that
the presidency isn't the real power
anymore
that it is the media
um
would i do coffee with scott adams on
trump tv
if he starts his own network um
you know i always i will listen to any
offer
but i kind of like not having a boss
don't you prefer me without a boss
because there you know i've noticed that
there are lots of things that
you that one could say but you do
you do filter yourself if you have a
boss and you might not even always be
aware of it but you do
um and not having a boss as is my
current situation
i do feel free to say what i think i
want to say
i'm not sure i would if i had a boss
and and by the way following me on
youtube
because that's monetized or being a
member of locals the subscription
service
are the ways that keep me independent
because if i have
lots of supporters and no boss i can say
anything i want
and that's the current situation so i do
appreciate all of you
very much all right
yeah i hear people asking about these
cycle raid the societal scytl
a company that i think was in has a
database in germany
and some of the or some or all of our
voter data goes there
to be counted and there's a rumor
that i don't think is verified
which is that our military went in and
went into that office and took the
servers or something
but i think that we don't have good
good data on that so i would not assume
that that is what you have heard it to
be
it could be but i wouldn't assume that
it's true
uh judge jeanine tweeted it well people
have tweeted it
but it doesn't mean it's real you know
that
that's the problem with twitter and also
the benefit of twitter
is that it doesn't check that kind of
information
what's the worst case scenario probably
what you're seeing
i i think the worst case scenario is
actually pretty good
honestly uh well let me let me put this
worst case scenario would be
um the senate also goes to democrats
and then biden becomes president and
then you get this full green new deal
higher taxes et cetera so worst case
scenario
is uh republicans lose the senate
but if the republicans keep the senate
i'm not
too worried about a president biden you
know there are less things he can
ruin if he's got that control on him and
i think that the net effect would be in
2024 the republicans would
sweep congress they'd already have
they'd either pack
or have the supreme court they'd have
the presidency
they can do whatever they want at that
point because
uh i think the democrats are going to
run stuff into the ground
where is the cat cat's at the
veterinarian's office
uh he's uh maybe got some internal
bleeding
we're talking about the hypothetical cat
not a real cat
golden age could be common corroded
virus
took us off schedule for that but i
think it might be coming all right
that's all for now and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
you
