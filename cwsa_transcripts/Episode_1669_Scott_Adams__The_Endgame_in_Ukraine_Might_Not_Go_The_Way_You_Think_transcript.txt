ladies and gentlemen
and welcome
to the only positive thing that's
happening in the whole damn world it's
called coffee with scott adams and
aren't the people who are not here
missing it
probably
people who were you know say on
airplanes or whatever for whatever
reason they couldn't make you here
imagine how bad they feel
but not you
you're a winner today you made it in
time for the simultaneous sip possibly
in a recorded version
won't matter to you at all
and now
can you join me in taking it up a notch
and
all you need is a copper mug or glass on
tanker chelsea cyanide canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
[Music]
fill it with your favorite
beverage i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
makes everything better it's cold
the simultaneous sip
go
you know no joke
this was one of the finest sips
i've ever enjoyed in my entire life
you would think to yourself you know
there can't be one sip of coffee that's
the best one you've ever had but then
then you enjoy it and
and then suddenly you realize i've been
wrong all of these years
there would be one sip
that would
be the sip that bound them all
the sip of all sips the sip the
siptastic
that's right
and that was it i'm glad you could be
here for it
well did any of you see the uh there's a
clip from saturday night live
in which the cast is uh
sort of mosque mat
you can i can't say mocking and masking
within the same paragraph they're too
close
they were mocking
the masking
yes they were mocking masking it was a
lot of masking mocking as well as a
booster
booster booing
so there was booster booing and although
they weren't really buoying them they
were basically making fun of the social
conundrum
that people have when they just try to
have a social
social event and somebody brings up any
of the pandemic stuff
and it was really good
i have to i have to commend them it was
actually some of the best work
honestly some of the best work i've seen
on saturday night live
in in their entire run so take a look at
that if you if you get a chance
did anybody
notice any cyber attacks on any uh
american used websites today
or was it just my wi-fi was bad
i was having troubles with amazon
no no trouble
i might have just had a local problem
okay
just me
just me
never mind
just
just rewind and forget that
amazon's working but it was really slow
this morning i wondered if it had some
kind of denial of service problem but i
guess we're all good so
yay
um
california and i guess a few other
states
like california are going to lift their
school mask
requirement
after march 11th
because as you know everything will be
different after march 11th
i don't know
and i think there's at least one
district in california that'll keep
masking and
some of the schools i think can still
decide to do it or not
but
for those of you
who were worried we'd always be masked
and i think there were some is there
anybody who thought we would always be
masked just perpetually
does any of you some of you did right
or at least you were worried about it i
was never worried about that
uh but
but i can actually see how you would be
you know it in retrospect in hindsight
as the masking does disappear
it's going to feel a little bit
ridiculous that you ever thought it
would be permanent
on the other hand
to support your view
almost everything that's happened in the
last two years has been ridiculous
am i right
so when you say something that sounds
ridiculous to my ears
which is that masks will be permanent
even after the pandemic's over
to my ears that just sounds ridiculous
but you know what else sounds ridiculous
everything that happened in the last two
years
so there's just nothing that's too
ridiculous anymore there's just nothing
that's over the line
you know putin going into ukraine
i didn't see it coming
i mean two years ago that would seem a
little ridiculous i think
not to smart people smart people saw it
coming for 15 years
but i was not among the smart on that
topic as it turns out surprise
all right
biden's going to give a state of the
union tonight what are we expecting from
that
uh probably
i don't want to
get ahead of things but
orator
oratory
genius
perhaps
um
soaring
rhetoric um inspirational
you know i feel as if when i watch biden
speaking tonight
my mind's eye will see eagles flying
and freedom breaking out everywhere
because he's exactly the kind of leader
you need
in anxious times
the kind of leader who inspires
confidence in fact one of the ways that
you can know
that the man is squarely in charge of
things is
body language
body language says a lot
a lot of people think body language is a
pseudoscience but not me
not me
i can read into body language just like
a fingerprint i can i can get certainty
from body language in fact yesterday
there was a
video that a lot of people were talking
about a biden walking across the lawn to
get to the
helicopter
and some people were making fun of the
way he walked
now i'm going to do an impression of the
way he walked
just to show you that
i think you're out of line a little bit
it might be the simulation winking at us
a little bit but nothing to worry about
and now
without further ado
i give you
my impression of biden walking
if you'd like to
be able to do this at home
it's not very difficult
what you want to do is you want to
stretch first stretch and stretching is
important for everything not just bite
and walking
yes
this
little that all right now you're ready
for bite and walking
you you want to get into the mindset
okay now remember biden is thin and
lanky
so
get you get yourself into your thin and
lanky
thin and lanky all right
now you're stretched you got your thin
and lanky on now the last part is
important
imagine that you're a marionette sort of
like pinocchio
and you've got a string attached to your
knees
and also to your arms
and so when you walk
you want you want the string to be
picking up your leg
so let's see the biden walk
just imagine that you've got marionette
strings
it goes like this
oh oh i didn't stretch enough
didn't stretch enough
okay i'm okay now
so
the uh there's a name for that walk
um
they're in the medical literature
they're i think they're at least two
different names for it
in the medical literature
uh one of them is inspires confidence
that's actually the medical name for it
inspires confidence
and
leadership
leadership
all right
so here's a mystery
which is probably because of the fog of
war and the mystery has to do with
ukraine
and the soviet soviet
whoops
not soviet the russian invasion of
ukraine
um
and how is it that there could be a 40
mile long
convoy of heavy military equipment and
troops
40 miles long
on an unprotected highway
heading straight for kiev
how do you explain that
somebody says four miles but i did read
40.
i did read 40.
i'm sure of it
well
let me let me propose
two possibilities
number one
russia already has complete error
superiority or almost complete
you'd need that right otherwise you
would see lots of attacks already on the
convoy where at least they try to blow
up
the front of the convoy at least slow
them down right but you're not even
seeing attacks on the front
it's it's as if noah is happening
now how do you explain that
like i said
the the number one explanation would be
russia already has complete air
superiority the convoy itself
has anti-aircraft capabilities
they probably have an umbrella of you
know their own aircraft they've got you
know radar they've got electronic
jamming for drones they probably have
everything you could possibly have
for defending itself
and maybe
maybe that's all they needed and they
could just go in with impunity because
wherever you've seen the losses
wherever the ukrainians got some
advantage
they were usually lightly
lightly armed right
they were up against um sort of sitting
duck
weak
kind of forces low end tanks
so the ukrainians got the ukrainian
resistance got
you know all kinds of uh we think good
results against weak elements of the
russian army
but if they pull it all together can
they just completely control the air
around where they are anyway
maybe
i mean it seems reasonably likely right
so that's one explanation
the other explanation is way more
interesting
and i'll put this in the context of
it doesn't seem like anything
predictable ever happens anymore does it
well let me say that again it doesn't
seem as if
anything that's predictable actually
ever happens anymore it's like whatever
you can't predict is what the thing that
happens
so what would be a thing
that would be
not predictable
yet consistent
with everything we've seen up to now see
that's the trick
come up with something that's not
predictable
but would also be completely consistent
with everything we know about the
situation so far and it goes like this
it's a trap
and it's not just a little trap
it's a decapitation strike
against
putin and i think
that if you think that zelinski
is performing better than you thought
were you surprised
and why were you surprised
because he did make it to the you know
he made it to the presidency so you
don't make it to the presidency without
some skill right
some intelligence
but then you say to yourself well but
really he's a a humorist and an
entertainer and maybe that was the only
skill that got him elected maybe he
doesn't have any depth
but
did you know it's not really easy
to succeed in entertainment
i don't know if anybody ever told you
that but
if you look at my profession for example
there are a lot of people who are
cartoonists
who if a cartoonist speaks out on any
topic that's not cartooning
you the public immediately says well
cartoonist right i mean you've seen it
with me a million times but
how many of my cartoonist friends
have advanced degrees for example
some of the top cartoonists
are literally
trained
in physics
uh some are
have law degrees from top schools
uh some of them are you know ivy league
graduates etc
um i've got advanced degrees
so it's actually fairly common for
people in the entertainment industry to
also be smart
not all of them i'm not saying that
cartoonists are smarter than the average
or anything like that i'm just saying
that it's not unusual for somebody to be
in the entertainment field and also be
bright it can happen
i mean it can happen
but the bias of the bias about anybody
in entertainment is that they can't go
too deep
now do a fact check on me
wasn't zelensky's father a military guy
was he a general i may be i may have
that part wrong but his father was a
military guy right
and
somebody will confirm that in a moment
but i think he was
uh or grandfather
somebody's saying colonel anyway he has
he has some military uh
you know genes and influence
now
were you surprised that he's done as
well as he's done so far
probably yes right
so in terms of the the marks he's
getting from the world
in handling the the attack he's getting
pretty high marks
um
all right
so
here's what could be happening
um and i'm gonna do some speculating
here and then people who know what
they're talking about will correct me
okay
what would be the easiest way to attack
a bunch of uh troops like a a full army
an invasion army
where would you have the best advantage
for attacking them well it depends on
what weapons you have right
if you have lots of weapons maybe the
best way to attack them is when they're
in convoy form they're lined up
in theory and i was hearing from people
who know more than i do yesterday about
how you would attack a convoy
some people said you attack your you
attack the front
and you know and that gets you pretty
much what you want because it's hard for
them to back up
some people said you attack the front
and the back
and then trap them and then pick them
off but that only works
if you have really good weapons
you know on the other side
if the if you're attacking a big convoy
with not enough people and weapons the
convoy can still be you because it's
still bigger than you are
right
so
the strategy you use depends on what
weapons you have
and how big you are and how capable your
military is compared to the convoy does
that make sense so it's not like there's
one strategy
there's a different strategy depending
on the terrain
the strength of the convoy what they
have there compared to you the distance
they're going to travel you know all
those variables
so the smartest person who answered the
question
based on the fact that it sounded right
to me
that's the only way i'd judge it the
smartest person said
just take out the
the fuel trucks
that's it
you just take out the fuel trucks
and let them run
and if you see another fuel truck coming
you take that one out
because if you take out their fuel
how long can a tank go without fuel you
know so if the the distance is long
enough you just have to take out their
supply line and just let them bleed
themselves and then you attack when they
when they're out of fuel
now again there are a million variables
so there's no one right answer
but
here's what i think
if you have limited size military
compared to your opponents
and that's the case right the ukrainian
resistance is smallish compared to the
russians
but
you had access to
the most advanced weapons
do you think ukraine has access to
as of today
the most advanced
normal weapons obviously not nukes or
weapons of mass destruction but do you
think they have the most
advanced
traditional weapons
probably
probably some nato country has said you
know
we wouldn't normally sell you this stuff
but we'll sell it to you today
so we don't know this and and if you
think that we wouldn't provide that the
weaponry
for lots of good reasons you might be
right
but let's just take this let's just game
this out
there is a kind of munitions and people
who know more than i do can now can fill
in some blanks there is a kind of
missile i believe
i think it's a missile
that you could shoot over a battlefield
that's full of tanks
so let's say the enemy has amassed a
cluster of tanks
there's one kind of missile
that can
that can separate above the tanks into
lots of different
kinetic
elements
and just destroy the entire battlefield
full of tanks all at once with one
missile
now would that be as effective on a
convoy
well it would do a lot of damage to a
convoy but the convoy is too spread out
my assumption is that they're going to
mask their forces around kiev
so is it true that at some point the
tanks will be clustered
or clustered-ish
maybe
so it could be that all this all that's
happening right now is that uh ukraine
is cleverly letting their entire army
end
until they cluster
and then they just take them all out at
once
now here question number one
if the united states
was fighting this war with our own
military and our own weapons
would the united states
have weapons that could take out an
entire battlefield
with the right kind of missiles yes or
no
would the united states have that
weaponry
just for ourselves
i'm seeing lots of yeses right now if
you go to youtube you can actually see a
demonstration of the actual weapon
i'm not i'm not inventing this
i didn't i didn't make this up that's an
actual missile
right
and there's a name for it uh somebody
will
somebody will tell me the name for it
but basically it's one missile that
breaks into
a bunch of little missiles
that gen just spread havoc and destroy
tanks for you know a very large
perimeter
now
let's take it all the way
if you thought that
zielinski
was fighting to not lose
you should be ashamed of yourself
because as zelinski demonstrated
that he would fight to not lose
i don't think he has
i think he's demonstrated he fights to
win
and winning in this case is taking putin
out winning is now surviving
winning is not surviving winning is
taking putin now
if
if and this is a gigantic f
because the most likely thing is that
russia's army is superior and it's going
to do whatever it wants that's the most
likely possibility
but since we live in an unlikely world
i'm just going to put this out here
if nato has provided certain types of
weapons to ukraine
those weapons could largely destroy
the biggest part of the russian invasion
army in 48 hours
and then what happens to putin
because at that point the russian public
says wait a minute you not only started
a war but you lost it
that's what it looked like you not only
started a war because remember putin is
playing i think
i think he it's a life and death game
for him
i think putin knows that if he loses the
war which i imagine he thought would be
unthinkable
if he loses
i don't know if he can hold power
you know i think some internal coup
would probably take him out at that
point
so
do not rule out the possibility
that zelinski is playing the same game
putin is which is a decapitation strike
but the way zielinski would do it is
surprisingly
with unusually good weapons
take out the entire russian invasion
force in 48 hours
and that might happen this week
now again
again
it's not the most likely
if we were just to game it out based on
common sense and you know ordinary
military assumptions you would just say
well the the gigantic army is going to
beat the smaller army at least at kev
i mean if the if their only thing
they're trying to do is take over the
capital
you would bet on russia
in the long run i mean they might level
it to do it but you'd bet on
right
so and uh and somebody's saying could we
do any of those things without air
superiority i would think that those
missiles that destroy all the tanks in
the zone
probably
if you shot enough of them
it's going to get past
any air defense
i would think
all right so that's the biggest question
to me
at the very least our
i guess the alternative to that is that
the reporting is all wrong we're out of
date
if um
wake up people russia is defending
itself
says
chuck haney
wake up people russia is defending
itself
okay that's what's happening
chuck
all right
uh consider the success of the colonies
against the british yeah i mean
every analogy fails because that would
be the last war right
we don't know what's going to happen in
the next one or even this one
you know i keep thinking that uh putin
will someday be called the uh
the the dumb ass of the donbass
i just feel like somebody's going to be
called the dumb ass of the dunbass it
doesn't quite make sense but
i like how it sounds
well the restrict the uh financial
restrictions are in place and russia is
going to have a tough time
jp morgan thinks that their economy
russian economy might contract 20
percent quarter over quarter
but they also say there's gigantic
variability it's it's not predictable
so how would you like to be a russian
citizen
who has been completely cut off from the
news or at least accurate news maybe
just like us we don't we don't know we
don't know if it's worse frankly
and suddenly your economy is tanking and
you do notice that and and you can't get
cash from your bank and you do notice
that
are you gonna start asking some
questions
will the russian public uh rapidly
educate itself
because they have access right they have
access to the internet not everything is
banned
so will the russian public figure out
what's going on here like really quickly
because the only way we can talk to the
public in russia is through the economy
isn't it
i feel like we found a way to
communicate with the russian public
through interest rates
and inflation
it's like hey
read the inflation
we're sending you a little message here
hey why does my
vodka cost so much this week
um well maybe somebody's sending you a
message because you can't get it the
normal way
i also wonder
in in a world in which everybody can
communicate
i'm not wrong that i can pick up a phone
and call anybody in russia that i want
to right
that i'm not wrong about that am i
don't no phones
connect to russia
it makes me wonder at what point
could
people in the united states or ukraine
or any place else just don't start
calling russian citizens
you know i guess we can't speak the
language so it would be a problem but
you know isn't there isn't the
information getting through just you
know by family members who live in other
countries
i feel like the information would be
getting through by now
and you know they wouldn't have enough
the russian public wouldn't care enough
until it starts costing the money and
that started today i guess
ish
um shell oil is pulling out of a russia
deal with gazprom
crypto is rising because the russians
are starting to put money in crypto to
protect it
their interest rates are up
so we don't know how long we can
sustain this
but
putin really has a timing problem now
doesn't he
there there's a theoretical amount of
time that ukraine
could hold out
that would end putin wouldn't it because
it would just be too much of a strain on
the russian economy
so it seems to me that there's going to
be some russian leader who says look hey
world if you'll take the sanctions off
we'll get rid of putin
and we'll get out of ukraine
there's probably i would bet you there's
some oligarch
or russian military person who's already
having conversations with nato or the
united states
saying hypothetically
i'm just going to float this idea
if something were to happen to putin
say falling down the stairs
and hypothetically
uh
my friend uh
alex and i were became the new heads of
russia
just
theoretically hypothetically just
spitballing here
would that work out for you guys
would you drop the sanctions
i feel as if somebody's going to make
that conversation
because
do you think that putin is the only
person in russia who had ambitions for
power
i doubt it
there must be a few people over there
who want some power
all it would take is one of them talking
to somebody
in the cia and saying
look if you'll agree to these things
i'll agree to take him out
you just got to cover my ass
you know once i take him out because all
hell's going to break
uh you know that conversation's
happening it's got to be
all right
um
if putin were to
hold the ukraine
you know conquer it and hold it in some
purely military fashion
how long can he do it
so
imagine the russian
economy being on the ropes
and then in addition to that
he got himself into a second afghanistan
yeah
see here's the problem
putin is thinking about
um
the the birth of the soviet union yeah
putin is thinking about
the part of russian history
sounds like it's a little bit cyclical
where they're gaining land and
influence
what he should be thinking about
is that ukraine is his afghanistan
now i'm sure it's occurred to him but in
in the way afghanistan
some say
was you know one of the reasons that the
soviet union fell right do i have that
wrong that
don't the historians say that
afghanistan was
some big part of why the soviet union
fell apart
can you give me a confirmation on that
i see people say yes all right
so
that's that's the idea you want to put
in putin's head you want to put in his
head
that this is his afghanistan
and all if the western press just
started reporting that
you can make it clear that winning would
be losing
you know what i mean
the the best way for putin to hold power
already
is to lose
is that too far
so let me say that again
if you were to game it out you're putin
and you're playing this chess game
and you're starting from today so the
history doesn't exist you're starting
from today
what is putin's best way to hold power
if he keeps ukraine and and wins the war
ukraine will bleed him dry and probably
end and his rule
if he loses
he might be able to gracefully lose
you know keep keep a couple of provinces
and claim that something good happened
and maybe hold power
so i think he's already in a position
where his best play is losing
because because if he wins he can't hold
it without bleeding himself to death and
and turning it in turning it into the
fall of the soviet union
by analogy
well here's the weirdest story
um
how many of you are familiar with nick
fuentes
i want to see what level of awareness
his name has
give me not just the yeses i want to see
the no's how many how many would say no
all right so it's a mix of yeses and
those people who are listening to this
are probably more keyed into social
media and stuff than other people
all right i'll just tell you what other
people say about him
which is uh let's say
um
so this is what the press says about him
and i forget where i read this might
have been
it was either on fox or cnn i forget
which one but
they say he has been labeled a white
supremacist by the us department of
justice
and the anti-defamation league
and he has been banned from most major
social media platforms for his white
nationalist
rhetoric all right so the thing you
should know about him
is that
that's his reputation
and he organized this uh gathering
of
people on the right i guess what was it
called let's see um
america first political action
conference
so nick fuentes organized that and he
actually got representatives marjorie
taylor greene
and paul gosar to to attend i think one
of them was recorded
um
and i'm thinking and of course you know
the usual
the usual uh outcry that you would
expect
and
i'm wondering
what what exactly were they thinking
what exactly is going on here
i don't i don't even have a
like a commentary about it
my commentary is
what
is it fake news
somebody says they weren't
um
chuck
you believe that
i've got most of my comments are for one
troll
oh yes uh ed right and fuentes was
uh last week he wrote on the messaging
telegram this is a quote from nick
fuentes i am totally rooting for russia
while also referring to putin as quote
mizar now
um
i don't know i don't even know what to
say about this story
like this is one of those stories where
you just read the story and you just go
i don't know i don't have anything to
add to that
that story just sits there like just
what it is
yeah and you just use your own opinion
on it
i don't know what to say about it
what is the simulation telling us with
ukraine well the simulation loves a
three-act movie
uh the siege of ukraine in theory should
be the third act
if we haven't already seen it
and the third act
if it's like a movie which would
indicate that the simulation likes react
plays which i think it does
then somehow
ukraine would survive the siege by the
entire russian military and it could be
because there's the real story is that
there might be some weapons that are
already there
or some weapons showing up
but
i have a i have a tough time believing
that the russian army
is not going to suffer some insane
casualties no no matter what regardless
of what kind of weapons there are
all right
um
as the biden administration done
anything to instill confidence they are
capable of winning
well we're not in it
the biden administration can't win this
war we're not in that war
they can't win the war they're not in
all right
everybody's in this war in a sense yes
all right the uh
state of the union today
um i think they're writing and rewriting
it
uh
i don't know what they have to talk
about do you think they're gonna go to
the
uh to the trump trump is a racist well
because i feel like that's all he has
lately
that's all biden has
it's just his old you know talking
points that have been discredited
um all right
so there's nothing going on except
ukraine and there's no new news about
ukraine that you can trust so it's a
little hard to talk about the news
like that
now
a lot of people are saying why is it
that the covid went away
at the same time that this war started
does it mean that all of our big
problems are artificial
and the answer is
somewhat
the the way the news covers things is
certainly artificial because it's driven
by the
business model of the news it's not
driven by events per se
so
yeah it can it can look like
we go from one emergency to another
and that they're almost timed or
scheduled
but it is true that we simply stopped
talking about the last thing because it
was boring and the new thing was more
interesting because finally it was
something new and it wasn't damn masks
and you know i certainly understand
everybody who is tired of the topic
i get it
but it was the topic so
um
china is sanction proof
they don't have to be sanction proof to
keep them away from taiwan that was the
comment i was just reading
um
i think
taiwan just might be unconquerable
because of being an island and modern
modern equipment
but we'll find out
we may find out
all right that's all i got for today and
