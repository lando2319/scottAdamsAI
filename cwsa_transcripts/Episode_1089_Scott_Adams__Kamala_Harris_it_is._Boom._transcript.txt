yep i did predict this one
see how much money i made and predict it
[Laughter]
you're never going to hear at the end of
this
all right for those of you who don't
know the back story
let me uh let me fill you in
so as some of you know in 2018
just about exactly um two years from
from today i was sitting in president
trump's
office i i just just sort of absorbed
this
it's 2018 two years ago
i'm sitting in trump's office literally
i'm in the oval office
and the president says to me two years
ago
who do you think's going to be the
nominee
and i said come harris
and he said joe biden
and i gave you know my argument
and then when kamala harris dropped
out of the race i doubled down
the dumbest thing anybody ever did
right you don't call somebody to be the
nominee the head of the ticket
if they've dropped out of the race
unless the head of the ticket
is a hollowed out puppet
in which case getting the vice
presidential
nomination might make you
the nominee in a practical sense
so i'm not going to say this is the
greatest prediction i have ever made
i'm going to shout it's the best
prediction i've ever made
because if you remember how much of a
risk i took
most of you do back in 2015 when i said
trump would win it all do you have any
idea
how much of a reputational risk that
that was
that was a very very unlikely outcome
in 2015. in 2018
i may have i may have called the nominee
out of what a hundred possibilities
i i gotta say you're never gonna hear
the end of this
how many of you thought i was a freaking
idiot
for the last well probably a year how
many thought
i was the dumbest freaking guy
that ever made a prediction you didn't
believe me did you
[Laughter]
you didn't believe me
so here we are hey eric
glad you could join us i'm just here
gloating for those of you who are
joining in
uh late uh this is my finest prediction
and i i should just i should never make
another prediction
i should just i just should never make
another prediction if i go out
with this one now let me remind you
of my other very contrarian predictions
and by the way
i'm not going to claim i get all of them
right right i got the vice presidential
pick wrong for trump for example so i
get plenty wrong
but when i hit one that's it's really
unusual
i like to call it out and i'll remind
you that
when the vegas shooter was killing
people in vegas the mass shooting there
that i said it would not be isis
and then isis took credit for it and
after isis took credit for it
i said no it's not isis
it wasn't isis when the cuban
embassy was attacked by the sonic weapon
what did i say
only person in the world as far as i
know
only person in the world who said
they're not going to find a sonic weapon
well they can look pretty hard but
they're not going to find a sonic weapon
and if you're hoping that that little
smudge that you think was an
alien spaceship that was moving really
fast on video from the
cockpit uh you know the the military
aircraft
nope i'm afraid you're not going to see
any aliens
so let me predict that that was not an
alien spaceship
closer to some kind of reflection now
somebody says i was wrong um i was
technically wrong
about kamala being the uh
the top pick or was i
we're not done yet right is it election
day let me check
let me check my the dates nope
it's not election day is it the
convention has the convention already
happened
nope it hasn't
now whether or not joe biden
literally steps aside i don't think
there's anybody watching this
who thinks that he will be in control
and when you pick a strong vice
president and one that
was legitimately in the running for
being the
you know the president the normal way
when you pick somebody that
strong you're kind of picking
the person who's running the country
and i got news for you
she helps the ticket a lot
i know it doesn't seem like that but
one thing that wouldn't hurt joe biden
at all would be to have a
tough on crime person of color
woman pretty strong choice
somebody says am i cia
if i am they're not paying me so
you know i want a paycheck if i am um
is she not better than biden though and
the ticket is unbalanced
yeah so i've often said that the perfect
vice president pick
is somebody who's a you know a grade
lower
in persona and magnetism and
you know ability even maybe compared to
who's on top
because you want to very clearly see oh
yeah
you know trump trump is technicolor you
know trump is
a thousand watts all the time and and
mike pence is a 60-watt bulb
a really good one i'm very pro-pence in
terms of his
capabilities and the job that he's done
as vice president
i i think he's the most underrated i
would say pence is one of the most
underrated civil servants
because he has a job where you just are
supposed to not make mistakes
and he does that really well he does
that really well he doesn't cause
trouble
and he's just a solid solid person but
in this one specific
case you because the head of the ticket
is a little wobbly shall we say shall we
say he's a little wobbly
if you had somebody who was below joe
biden
you would have the problem that they
would be two levels watered down
because remember biden is still the same
biden
who didn't look good compared to obama
right
obama picked a perfect vice president
didn't cause trouble and definitely
didn't look as
interesting appealing as obama did as a
as a as a person as a politician as
anything really
so if you start with obama as you know
somebody who could solidly win
and you say well his vice president's
not he's no obama
he's a level below which was perfect for
being a vice president
and if he picks somebody that's below
him
now you're two levels below obama
your vice president's gonna look um
like what like like what would be one
level
i think people are gonna be texting me
to uh
to note my accurate pick but if you had
a vice president pick who was two levels
below biden
who the hell would that be right
it wouldn't even be you'd have to go sub
mammal
you'd have to say um joe we've been
looking for somebody who's
you know low a level below you and
we've exhausted all of our mammalian
possibilities
we're thinking of extending our search
into the rest of the animal kingdom
maybe an anteater i don't know
we got to look around so joe biden was a
special case
he needed a stronger vice president than
he is as as a candidate and and kamala
gives you that because she's got the
senator experience
it would have been a huge mistake to go
karen bass
but but
here's the scariest part and i can't
remember who said this
it was somebody smart greg gefeld it
might have been greg guffeld who said
this
but i remember thinking oh god that's
true
i think he was the one who said if the
democrats had won
god was it him or was it somebody else
somebody helped me on the
because it was just on tv the other day
help me with who said this
but if the democrats had run two women
on the basically the anniversary of the
suffrage and getting the vote
it would be a home run two women
and i think to myself oh yeah that would
be
a double woman ticket would be
really hard for trump it just the
matchup would be terrible
it would be the worst case scenario and
if biden drops out
well if biden did drop out before the
election
you've got yourself a double woman
ticket
and it's it would be a real problem it
would be a real problem for trump i
think
just because a double woman ticket
almost just guarantees you get
pretty much all the women and then they
just gotta get
somebody else and they're done
so not all the women but you know what i
mean
um so there you go um
somebody was mentioning george conway in
an unflattering way
and i'm not too proud to say it made me
laugh
i really didn't have much to say but i
didn't feel like i could not
share this moment in public do you know
how long i've waited
to get the final answer because i was so
far out there
like you know so far out on the plank
there just weren't a lot of people
agreeing with me until recently she was
leading in the
she was leading in the the betting um
until very recently so at least maybe
maybe a quarter of the people agreed
with me
oh i'm getting uh i'm getting the
well some saying it was greg guffeld
some said trey gowdy it wasn't trey
gowdy
i think it might have been greg gutfeld
said it on the day that trey gowdy was
on the show
on the five i think that's what it was
well
anyway it was a very insightful
comment because it would be a killer
ticket and
uh it does however ruin the pawn i had
all
you know all cued up are you ready
if biden had picked bass
as his vice president and somebody
accused her of lying
because eventually every politician gets
accused of lying
i have no reason to believe that she
lies because i don't know much about her
so i won't make that claim i'm just
saying
if you're running for president you
might get accused of a lie
and i was going to break this out on
twitter
vast lies matter come on that would have
been pretty good
uh probably would have been cancelled
for it but totally worth it for a good
pun
totally worth it so somebody says it's a
hollow victory
is that a pun i can't tell
all right uh that's enough gloating for
me i'm going to get back to doing
something else
but
somebody says great guess great guess
this is skill
oh no no
oh no i just saw a comment that i can't
unsee
all right i don't even want to say it
but geo payments
[Laughter]
can can you also is it too late i
stopped it on my end but i think the
comments are going
by to your head all right if there are
children in the room
you should send them away okay all the
children
send them away there's there's a parting
joke
courtesy of geo payments
at geopayments here's the
this is just devilishly good uh
and his joke is that the the ticket will
be joe blow
[Laughter]
joe blow 20 20.
joe blow 2020
[Laughter]
all right now i have to be honest
i do not approve and i mean this
seriously this is a serious statement
even though i'm laughing when i say it
i don't approve of any of the uh you
know
kamala harris sexual insults about
her past i just don't like it i don't
like fat shaming i don't
i don't like you know any kind of
mocking people for their sexual
preference i don't like any of that
stuff
and i don't like it when women
especially are
are being piled on for you know whatever
experiences they've had in the past
that's their business not mine
that said all of that said
and i mean it sincerely it's not a place
that i think is appropriate for joking
that said joe blow 2020 is one of the
best jokes ever
and that's not my fault it's not my
fault that i laugh at that
i'm a victim i'm a victim just like you
are
if you're laughing at that you're a
terrible person just like me
uh you're deplorable uh i just saw
george tikai who's a big uh
trump critic
who said that you know whoever the vice
presidential candidate is that they
should stop
piling on each other as democrats
because
you know as soon as that person is
selected uh
george takei said that trump and his
goons
would be coming after her and i tweeted
back to him and said we prefer to be
called deplorables
but it would be a great band name you
know trump and his goons
it would be a great painting but how in
the world
did we not say how in the world did we
now see joe blow
all right i'm not going to tweet that
because i'm quite serious
about i don't think it's a fair line of
attack you know when
when bill clinton was in office and he
was having his
his stuff i was adamant that we
shouldn't care
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna change that
as standard you know i don't care what
they do
i don't care about their personal life
it's just it's just not
it's just not my business and it
shouldn't have an effect on them doing
the job
so that's all i have for now i'll talk
to you later
