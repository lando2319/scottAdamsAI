hey everybody
yeah i'm a minute late
stop here complaining
the price is right
sure i might be coming to you late
but the price perfect
just perfect
now with any luck i've situated my two
cameras here to my two flat platforms
so that my eye contact will be
approximately where it needs to be
and
we will do something called the
simultaneous sip in a moment after
youtube gets through all of its
advertisements
but let's talk about
some of the things happening today
uh in the irony alert department aoc's
dress designer
you remember aoc's dress for the met
gala said tax the rich
well it turns out that the person who
designed that dress
has not paid their taxes
that's right the designer of the dress
that says tax the rich
is behind her taxes or his taxes i don't
know who it is
but uh
you know that the simulation had to give
us that right
just had to give us that
thank you simulation
and this is why you should show your
gratitude to the simulation
yes it's a recurring theme
hypocrisy
well here's a good
sign of things to come and the golden
age
i keep telling you that this pandemic
looks bad
i know it looks bad
it does
but
it was required to kick off the golden
age
because it reset everything and people
rethought everything and suddenly
there's a whole bunch of better thinking
and new ideas coming here's one
california
just change some legislation
to make it easier to get approval to put
a second
home
on your lot that's only zoned for one
home
that's a really big deal that's a really
big deal
because
if you're trying to get affordable
housing
there's nothing more affordable than
free land
it's free it's already there and if
you've got a big backyard or you get a
little extra
land on the side you can add one of
these little adus or
small units
so here are the things that you'd save
so land would be free
because now you can put a second home
where your one home is
you have free land
wouldn't cost anything
well it wouldn't cost much extra to
bring in utilities from the street
property is probably already you know
graded and everything for uh
for a home because there's one on it
you wouldn't need architects or
engineers or contractors if you get
these prefab homes you take all of that
expense out of it
and
because they're prefab and they're built
in factories and you just sort of unfold
them in some cases once you get to the
site
should be able to drop the cost of a
pretty good home
by
i don't know
eighty percent
or more it's a pretty big deal
so keep an eye on that trend
all right
i believe it's time for a little thing
called the simultaneous sip i know
you've been waiting for it and i know
your life will not be complete
without it
and so
i would invite you now to grab your cup
or mug or glass of tanker chelsea stein
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
everything it's called the simultaneous
sip it's going to happen now go
i feel my immunity to covid
increasing every moment
because it is
well um more
more news from the golden age
or is it
the following news
comes in two forums one an optimistic
look at the future and what technology
and the potential of humankind
uh holds for us
very very good looking sort of a story
but there's a second part of the story
that i will announce in
ominous tones every now and then and the
story goes like this
uh the very first child born from
polygenic screening as an embryo
has just happened so a live human has
been born
who was selected
for her good quality embryo
specifically her genetic components
and the idea was
that a company named genomic prediction
did the work in this case there are some
other companies i guess that do this
and they will uh basically make sure
your
your artificially inseminated
baby
uh is the best quality baby you can get
now
that's pretty good right because you get
yourself a better baby
baby's happy you're happy
lowers the health care costs
more productive workers
pretty good pretty good right
or is
it or is it
or is it
one step to eugenics
and a hitler-like
future
or
is it a way to get everybody happier and
healthier and
have a more competitive world in which
your national defense is much aided by
your many inventions and innovations
that sounds pretty good
or
somebody's gonna make a master race
and the world will be destroyed in world
war
three
it's definitely going to be one of those
two things
but i'm an optimist i like to think it's
the good one but let me ask you this
question
true or false
all right
hold your hold your ethical and moral
uh outrage we will stipulate that you
have it we stipulate that you're morally
outraged by the story
but here's the question
are we gonna have to make super babies
for national defense
think about it
your economy drives your ability to
defend yourself if your economy is good
enough you can buy all kinds of good
weapons and you can bribe people and you
can do everything that you need to do
so you need a pretty good economy you
need lots of innovation lots of
invention
to stay ahead of your adversaries
and military development
what if
china let's just pick china as an
example what if they decide to make a
bunch of super babies
with high iqs and high ability to invent
and innovate
and suddenly all the inventing and
innovating moves over to china
and their their economy is screaming
because they got the super babies just
starting startups and unicorns like
crazy
yes or no
it's a defense homeland defense
imperative
to make super babies
in the long run you know not much
difference this year
but in the long run
let's say the hundred year future of the
republic
do we have to make super babies to
survive
to be competitive
define super super would be
let's say you could crank out an elon
musk
or a bill gates at will
because you can
now not necessarily their personalities
but you could hit their iq
you could hit their iq and you could
probably know some things about them
um
somebody says we already are yeah in a
sense we're already practicing eugenics
because we have more mobility
what's the difference between a smart
engineer working for microsoft
who searches for a mate
and finds another smart engineer working
for some other country or company it
could be another country
and then you know they get together
well it's sort of selective breeding
isn't it
you're gonna get a pretty smart kid
if the two smart engineers from wherever
they were in the world
get together to make a baby
probably that kid's gonna have some
potential
right
and so we're already practicing eugenics
just because we have mobility and we
have the internet so it's happening on
its own but what happens if we take it
to the next level and make super babies
um i would say that we have all kinds of
moral
hazards here
obviously but might be necessary
might be necessary because without
enough super babies
i know can you compete in the future
i wonder
speaking of uh the future that's looking
good there according to saul of united
who alerted me to a tweet or a story
that there are two of the four
contenders to become japan's next prime
minister
are so pro-nuclear
that they're pushing for small new
modular reactors and nuclear
fusion reactors of course you'd need to
develop that technology
but the small modular reactor idea two
out of four japanese candidates for
prime minister
now
maybe one of them won't win
but
um you'd have to think that japan is
pretty
nuclear shy right if anybody had a right
to be between fukushima and of course
hiroshima and nagasaki
which had nothing to do with nuclear
power per se but you've got to figure
it's
it's all in the psychology somehow
but even japan
can't come up with a reason not to do
nuclear
think about it
even japan
doesn't really have an argument against
it and i keep telling you that the the
anti-nuclear people just disappeared
it's one of the biggest stories in the
country but because it's a story by
subtraction you just don't notice it
you know most of the stories we notice
are something just added to the
atmosphere hey that wasn't there before
but when something just sort of drains
out of the atmosphere you don't notice
it because it happens slowly
there are no
there are no anti-nuclear energy
protests
are there
i don't think they exist anymore it's
because the technology and the knowledge
about the necessity of nuclear power
especially if you're worried about
climate change
it's it's beyond debate now
i feel like it's literally
one of the few topics i've ever seen in
my life
that's now beyond debate
when has that ever happened
think of one other example
i don't maybe you could come up with one
but i can't
well there was some kind of conservative
rally
was it yesterday
uh
and i guess the organizing theme was
about the january 6 protesters who were
still in jail
and they seemed like political prisoners
to many of us
but insurrection too was
a disappointing sequel
it turns out that without
trump's direct involvement
there is not much energy
there just wasn't enough energy so it
was lightly attended because people were
smart enough to know it was probably a
setup
in some way or at least dangerous
without enough benefit
and of course they were under undercover
cops and there were photos of them
looking obviously like undercover cops
and
humorously so
i mean they're
oh trump somebody says
i'm seeing on locals some trump said it
don't go because it's a setup
is that true did trump advise people not
to go
oh i'm saying i'm saying yeah fact check
true
okay well that would also explain why
there's low attendance
and that was smart of trump i think
um
but trump also knows that energy is what
matters
probably the smartest thing about trump
is his understanding that energy beats
facts
and if you can move energy where you
want it
getting attention for example
putting a focus on something for example
then you win and
and uh trump is an energy monster
like he just eats energy and then he
spews it out in a different direction
um but this
this event didn't have any energy
all right um
and one of the things that came out of
it was a lot of people online were
mocking the
the very white looking
the people who were dressed in their
supposedly undercover clothing and they
looked like every white person in warm
weather you know the t-shirt and the you
know khaki like shorts and there was one
guy wearing dress socks with his
sneakers
they look
so
so white
but
i of course took some of this personally
because
they were being mocked for dressing
exactly the way i dress
it took a little personally
but i would like to defend
my people
my people being
poorly dressed adult white men
now it's not limited to white men but
it's the only category i can speak of
with some authority
do you think
those of you who have noticed that i'm a
poorly dressed adult white man
do you think that i do this
intentionally
do you think i wake up in the morning
and say
you know
you know what would really work for me
to be poorly dressed
that's what i like
do you think that when i
walk past the
the clothing store of really sharp and
stylish clothing that's made just for
adult white men
do you think that when i walk by that
store i say to myself
you know
i couldn't go in that store and i i
could afford those clothes and
if i bought some of them i would look
stylish and attractive at least the
clothing part
i choose not to
i'm just gonna walk on by
no no i don't do that do you know why
because that clothing store
doesn't exist
men
men can you back me
that clothing store i just described the
one with the stylish and
really sharp clothing for men like me
doesn't exist
if it did
would i look like this
seriously
would i dress like this
if there were a store
that i could go to
to buy clothes that don't make
me look like
a tornado in a thrift shop
would i
no
no
i would not
give me any option
to not look the way i look
i'm going to be taking it i'm going to
be taking it
what's the best advantage of being
black in the united states
come on what is it alright there are
disadvantages obviously what's the
biggest advantage of being a black man
in the united states a black man what's
the biggest advantage
you don't have to look like this
right
you don't have to look like this
you can actually wear
stylish
fashion-forward footwear
you could wear a shirt that i could
never put on
and you look great
you know on average everybody's
different of course but on average
they've got options
where's my option
well
and i would like to protest because i
feel that the fashion designers for my
segment of the market
i feel that they're just trying to match
the boringness of my
lifestyle
and personality
with the clothing
so i feel like the fashion designers
look at me and my people
and say
not too much glitz there we we want to
we want to tone it down and give them
something
modest and unattractive
because they think
that i'm boring and uninteresting
but let me tell you if i were boring
could i play air guitar like this
[Music]
[Music]
no
no
that is not the look of a boring person
that's the look
of somebody
who should be well dressed
stylish
to bring my
clothing appearance up to the coolness
which i just demonstrated and i think
that data is incontrovertible
incontrovertible
all right
according to the wall street journal in
a few years
two women will earn a college degree for
every man
i think it's already 50 percent more
women enrolled in college
did that sneak up on you i mean i think
i think we all knew that women were
enrolling in college
at a greater percentage
but did you know
women are like
like 60 of college now
it's like you know 50 more than men
when did that happen
what the hell is going on
um and in a few years it'll be two to
one
i have a hypothesis and let's see if you
agree with me on this
whoever society educates the most
is who they value the most
yes or no
whoever society
educates the most
is whose society values the most
yeah i'm seeing a lot of people agreeing
with me on locals because it's a little
faster than youtube
i'm singing now seeing some no's on
youtube but mostly yeses on
locals
interesting a little a few more no's on
youtube
well i mean you could make some
exceptions you could say oh you know was
the
yeah you could find some exceptions to
that but i think as a general rule
the people that we
allow to be the most educated
and when i say allow i don't mean it's
necessarily intentional
it's just the
the organization of things causes some
people to be more educated than others
for a variety of good and bad reasons
but i think the net of that is you find
out who who is valuable
right
and and i don't mean valuable in my
opinion
and i don't mean valuable in some you
know
god-like
judgment way
i mean just society itself deciding
who's valuable
and i think it accidentally decided that
women are twice as valuable as men
roughly speaking
all right
um apparently the biden administration
is
rounding up and sending a bunch of
haitian immigrants home that came across
our southern border with the the other
immigrants from south of the border
and
here's my question to you
why are we sending all of the haitian
immigrants home because i think they're
going to send all of them home
but
i don't believe we do that with all of
the let's say mexican or central
american immigrants coming across the
border do we
now i understand that the law allows us
to do this you know the trump
administration out of law the biden
administration is using it to send them
back
but
are we going to ignore the fact that
they're sending the black people home
and not the not the people who are brown
i mean
uh
what's the reason
i know
so
it feels to me
like there's a little bit of uh
explaining that the biden administration
needs to do because if this had you know
shoe on the other foot test you know the
alan dershowitz test if this had
happened under trump
wouldn't all the conversation be about
well why are only the black people being
all sent home
what's up with that
right it's a fair question
to me it looks like unequal treatment
and i haven't heard the
explanation
if there is an explanation that has
something to do with i don't know the
country being different in some way
i'm open to that
but
are you okay
that
your country is treating the black
people coming in differently than the
other people
you shouldn't be
you should at least be asking the
question
right if they get a reason they have a
reason but i haven't heard it so let's
hear it
um did you hear about this clinton
lawyer guy
who got indicted i think for do a fact
check about this i'm not sure i got all
the facts on this right
because all these lawyer stories are a
little
confusing for us non-lawyers
but i guess
we now know
based on an indictment we can piece it
all together
that hillary clinton did in fact start
the russian collusion
fake news
she paid a specific lawyer to go start
that fake news and he succeeded
and
it could have made a big difference not
only to have trump not get elected but
to maybe potentially kick him out after
he got in office
and here's my question to you
how is that not a coup
because
what law is it that says you have to be
firing bullets
for a coup
have we not agreed that cyber war
is war
everybody you all agree with that right
that if you do a cyber attack and it's
you know big enough kind of attack is
war
it doesn't have to be bullets
so if somebody tried to overthrow a
government
with a designed lie
that's part of a organized plan and it's
organized we're not talking about a
conspiracy theory that grew out of you
know organically and people believed it
and isn't
isn't that too bad
we're not talking about
you know entities reporting things that
they thought were true but they got it
wrong
are we no we're talking about an
organized
attempt to change the government
based on a lie
a well-developed choreographed lie
and that's not illegal
how is that not illegal
if it could be demonstrated that this is
all true and that hillary was the
primary
architect of all of it
shouldn't she be in jail
i mean actually literally i'm not even
talking politically at this point
how is that not illegal
i don't really understand i mean i
actually don't understand
it does
does the law about treason
specify bullets
it doesn't right
does it even specify violence
does treason require
violence or a coup does a coup require
violence
i don't know
i mean i think they're good questions i
don't know i don't know what the answers
are
and here's another coup attempt
apparently it's now matter of fact that
pelosi uh dur after the election
uh where biden won
pelosi was so concerned about uh trump
being quote crazy
that she called general milley and now
of course this is according to bob
woodward
so what are the odds that bob woodward
is reporting this correctly
who knows i mean not not high
but um
supposedly pelosi said that uh
even millie knows well here's the actual
alleged quote that i doubt is a quote
but allegedly
um
said uh
he's crazy this is pelosi to general
milley around after the election he's
crazy you know he's crazy he's been
crazy for a long time so don't say you
don't know what his state of mind is
now given that this is in a transcript
of a call between pelosi and millie
it suggests that she actually believed
this
right
that she actually believed that trump
is actually crazy in a literal sense you
know not just hey he's wacky
but crazy
she actually believed it
did
did you think she believed it
i found that a little surprising
you know it's possible she was lying to
millie too i guess
but it sounds like a call you wouldn't
make
unless you actually believed it
check me on this it's more of an opinion
would pelosi have even made this call
unless she believed it
would she
would you make that call unless you
believed it
because i don't see there was an upside
really because trump had already lost
the election
once he's lost the election
you don't have to worry about the
politics of it i feel like she was
worried about the real thing
right
i mean she could be lying but what would
be the point of it what would be the
point of lying
so given that i don't think there was a
point to lie i think she actually
believed he was crazy in the risk to the
country
now
under that context
if once you knew that millie had talked
to uh the chinese counterpart general
and assured them that you know there
wasn't going to be an attack
it makes more sense now doesn't it
so if you know that millie
was aware that pelosi was talking out
loud
about trump maybe having a nuclear
attack and who else are you going to
attack really
i mean you can attack france yeah who
would you aim your nukes at
um
given that china has many sources
what were the odds that china would find
out through its own sources
either spies or other
that pelosi
literally believed there was a risk of a
nuclear attack
literally
what if china had found that out
on their own
that's a dangerous situation
right if they'd found out that pelosi
was really talking about a nuclear
strike risk
what would they do
well i think they would have to
go on some kind of alert status wouldn't
they
now i don't know enough about the
military to know if any of the what i
say next makes sense so give me a fact
check on this
i think they could have raised their
alert
now if they had would we have noticed
would we notice if china went on war
footing just for defensive reasons
i feel like we would
they'd have to move some stuff around
right they'd have to do something
different that we'd notice
and then what happens if
you we've got this chaos of the you know
the changeover in politics and somebody
notices that china just went on war
footing
what was it that we were afraid of
right
we were paranoid paranoid that china or
some adversary would try to take
advantage of us during chaos
now i don't think there was much chance
that they would do that militarily but
it was on our minds
so you could easily see how
misunderstanding would escalate can't
you
let me ask you if you can did i paint a
picture in which there was at least a
risk
that the pelosi talking about nuclear
strike
could have caused china to find out
about it could have caused them to
respond
could have caused us to respond to the
responding and then god knows what
happens next
did i make my case
i'm seeing mostly no's
then if i didn't then what part did i
uh miss
let's let's break it down
do you believe that china could have
found out
that pelosi was literally concerned
about a nuclear strike let's just start
with that
do you believe that china could have
found out on their own with their own
sources
okay i'm getting yeses for that
do you believe that if they heard that
they would have responded in a way we
could detect
so that's the second question
would china have responded militarily
like just preparation
in a way we could detect
so that's where i'm seeing the nose
oh really
you think we wouldn't be able to detect
a
a war footing
well i think maybe the people have less
confidence in our
intelligence than i do
i feel like our intelligence would know
that right away
i feel like it because it would be it
would be too big
too many wheels would be put in motion
for us to not catch it with one of our
sensors
you know meaning human or
or satellite or something
okay well i'll just put that out there
but if it turns out that uh
milly knew that that was a risk and he
made that call and he cut it off i would
say that's just doing his job
and doing it well actually you know i'll
criticize him on
afghanistan all day long and wokeness
etc
but
i just don't see what's wrong with that
call i really don't
i mean i want to because so many of you
do see what's wrong with it
i can't see it it just looked like he
was doing exactly the right thing
to me now some of you said but wait
scott
wait
what he did was tell an adversary we're
not going to attack
which gives that adversary an advantage
because now we're not unpredictable
anymore
and any and worse
really worse
millie said that if we were going to
attack
he would have called and warned them
do you think that really happened
do you think that millie actually said
that
remember quotes
in a book
almost always are made up
almost always are made up so i think the
odds of him actually having said that
twenty thirty percent tops
so i first of all don't believe he
actually said
secondly and when i say actually said it
i mean
said it in those exact words it might
have been something in that domain
secondly
if millie said that if we were going to
attack i would have called you
what did that mean
did you take that to mean that he would
call you right before the attack
to get you get you ready
i will think so
that doesn't sound like anything you
would have said
how about this for a more reasonable
interpretation right you've all worked
for well not all of you many of you have
worked for big organizations you know
how stories get morphed over time
so what if
millie was really trying to say
that you would know
long before we were actually going to
launch an attack
you and i would have had lots of
conversations about whatever it was that
was the problem
to try to avoid an attack
so since you and i have not had lots of
conversations personally
about how to avoid you know the
escalating risk of an attack
you can be pretty sure
that there's no talk about that
because you'd know it long be i mean
there would no there's no scenario in
which there would be a sneak attack
let's put it that way
so if the context was
that when millie said i would call you
it could mean not one phone call but
rather we would have been talking about
this for a long time there's no scenario
in which we're going to surprise you
with an attack
you would see it coming for a year
because we would be threatening you for
a year to try to get you to back down
from whatever it was we thought was war
worthy
it's never going to sneak up on you
now suppose he said that
and the way it was reported was
i would have called you
because that's exactly the way things
get misquoted
you know a a fairly
you know nuanced
thing just gets called into gets turned
into i would have called you
right so we don't know what happened
here's here's the second part
suppose millie said exactly what was
reported and said if we were going to
call if we were going to attack i would
call
you would he mean it
because you would have to assume that he
meant that literally
in order to be angered at the way he
handled it
when i read that i said to myself
no that means if we're not going to
attack he'd probably tell you that to
avoid any misunderstanding
but if we were going to attack
and it was going to be a sneak attack
i think he just lied
because he's allowed to do that
he's allowed to lie
you know in the military you're allowed
to fool your adversary
so what if he just said that he would
have called them
so that we maintain the uh you know a
little bit more advantage if we
surprised them
which we're not going to do we're not
going to surprise china within jack
yeah
anyway i'll just put that out there
because i think there's i think we have
to give millie a whole bunch more
benefit of a doubt
because i think woodward is the least
credible person in the story
i have my problems with millie
but not compared to woodward
and woodward's a big problem millie i
don't know
but one of them i trust a lot more than
the other one it's not
it's not woodward that i trust
so
i mean milly made it that far
i mean he had to he had to be trusted by
somebody to get that far
all right here's my question where are
the economists on this whole border
immigration problem
where are the economists telling us that
each
let's say the immigration cost each of
us x dollars
or benefited each of us x dollars
wouldn't you like to know your share
what if the economist came out and said
you know once you look at all the ins
and outs of this immigration
we don't have enough
birth rate
naturally in this country to keep things
going the way we like we actually need
to bring in people especially young ones
that are willing to work etc
and that
will actually come out ahead
i don't know that that's the case by the
way i'm just saying that you don't
either
do you
do you know if we come out ahead or come
out behind
there are some things we can measure
but that doesn't mean we know the net
we can measure for example the impact on
health care
right
uh but we don't know what happens in 20
years when these kids grow up and become
you know members of the workforce you
know they're driving the economy etc
don't know
i know would it is it helping or hurting
so
the thing is that if the economists
can't help us we're just guessing
we really are i mean we can measure the
crime
and that alone would be enough reason
not to let people in
but here's the system that i think we
should have for the border we should
stop treating it like a goal and treat
it like a system
here's the difference
a goal
would be to only let in people we want
uh but also be uh kind and
um
yeah i mean we would be kind
and let's say empathetic and we would
try to treat everybody with dignity and
uh and humanity so that would be a good
goal
to let enough people in to keep our
country healthy but also treat the
people coming in with the maximum
dignity and
humanity that we can
keep everybody safe
those would be goals
now
problem is some of them are
contradictory
and it's not a system what we need is a
system and i would suggest that the best
system
would be this
you get a panel of economists
you know get make it bipartisan get some
dems get some gop
put them on that panel and say all right
you economists tell us what is the right
amount of immigration
that helps the economy
and then we will let that many people in
and then when we reach that limit we'll
say all right that's enough for this
year and we'll do our best to secure the
border after that and then next year
we look at the economy again and we make
a separate decision
okay
this time
well as bipartisan as you can be i mean
i i would go for something like a
supreme court model
where they're definitely partisan even
on the supreme court but they're still
credible
you know there's definitely a majority
in one party but still credible because
you do get to read the minority opinion
etc so the process works
better than you know the alternatives
so if you had a really secure border
with a door
that could open and close you would let
people in based on the economists and
you would seal the border based on what
the economics look like
and you would depersonalize it
i mean why we're talking about it's
racist or not racist to allow
immigration is ridiculous
we should take all of that personal
stuff out of it and just say it's just
money
and we should say that this is not a
question of fairness
right
because if you try to be fair to
everybody
you just can't really balance all those
interests because what's fair to the
immigrants isn't what's fair to the
citizens of the country etc
so
i don't think you should use fairness as
your standard what would be a better
standard than fairness
well maybe a glurpin a glurpin
so i think it's sort of a glurping
situation and
if you haven't heard that word it's a
new word
and it applies to a situation that
isn't fair
but it's better than it isn't
capitalism is a good example capitalism
is not intended to be fair in terms of
outcomes
but we're all better off because it's
not because that's what makes people
work hard and makes enough money so that
everybody can get at least a taste
so i think the
the border is another one of those
situations where if you try to make it
fair you really couldn't balance
everybody's interests
so instead let's just treat it like the
glurpin it is a situation in which
fairness isn't really desirable in this
case you just want the most efficient
system that keeps the united states
healthy because keeping the united
states healthy
is really good for a lot of other things
right it's really good for a lot of
other things
so
whoa hello
that fell
over um
apparently the covent hysteria is the
highest in blue states i saw zoo bee say
something about that
on twitter and uh bill maher was talking
about bill maher was talking about how
democrats in polls
are completely wrong by orders of
magnitude about how dangerous the
coronavirus is
now
given that the democrats are the party
of data
ike that is entirely too
generous
but thank you
so we've got this big difference between
the dems and the republicans in terms of
what they think
is the danger of hospitalization
and i
i mean it's really off like the
democrats are way off in understanding
it
so
why is there no
republican who is making a big deal
about the fact that
that democrats don't understand the data
why are we only talking about
republicans
being anti-vax and you know why aren't
they believing the science
the science
when in fact
the biggest reason that the democrats
are getting the vaccinations
is that they don't understand the math
that's the reason they don't understand
the math
and so a lot of the you know the
mandates etc are driven by a lack of
understanding
or at least a support for it by a lack
of understanding
so i think some republican needs to make
hay with this about their lack of
following the data because it's so
demonstrably true i mean the polls show
it overwhelmingly clearly
it's a claim that you can't argue
it would be really hard to argue
that democrats don't have a wildly
incorrect idea of the risk because
because we know the risk
and we know what the polling says
it's pretty clear
um
as naval said
yesterday on twitter the masks will come
off not once everyone has been
vaccinated
but once everyone has been infected
now i would only add the obvious that
you know nothing is an absolute
so it's not really everyone
but let's say most everyone is going to
have to get infected before the masks
come off i think that does make sense
now
are you ready for my best idea the other
day to open up everything
i have an idea
that i think
could get the country back to normal
even with an endemic
it goes like this
correct me if i'm wrong i have a lot of
engineers on here is there a device
that can measure air flow in a room
fairly quickly
where you can just sort of hold it up
and you could tell if there's sufficient
air flow in the room
that things are blowing around right
uh so i'm saying yes
yes that's that's a device now
is it such an expensive device
that you couldn't get one that would be
available at least to occasionally test
as many rooms as possible
i feel like you could
let me ask you this if you did a study
of rooms that have air flow now i'm not
talking circulation
right because you're all going to jump
to circulation
not talking about it we all know
circulation is good we all know an open
window is good so forget those things
this is not what i'm talking about so
i'm not going to talk about an open
window
and i'm not going to talk about how well
it circulates from inside downside i'm
only talking about whether the air is
moving
my hypothesis is this
that you don't get covered when the air
is moving
that's my hypothesis now i feel like
you'd be able to test that
because you could find out what spaces
were getting people infected and you
could find out if they have more airflow
okay
oh i'm so mad right now
i was trying everything i could
for somebody not to make a comment that
says circulation works and i just saw it
go by please dear god
can we all agree that opening a window
works
you don't need to tell me that
we all know circulation is good
stop saying that in the comments
we're not talking about those things
just airflow that's it
and
so if you have a device where you can
test it and you can find out in most
cases you have an idea where somebody
got infected could you not find
every space that's safe
and every space that's knocked
and as soon as you knew
which spaces were safe
and which is which were not
okay on locals you're doing the same
thing to me
please dear god
stop telling me about how you can
fix your hvac system to filter out the
coronavirus
not the topic
that's not the topic
i i get it that it's good stuff and we
should be doing it
but uh it's completely off topic
um and here's my my why my hypothesis
goes like this you've seen smokers you
know they they exhale and the
plume of smoke is is like intense for a
while and then it seems to dissipate
well wouldn't you assume
that somebody who was standing in the
middle of a
intense plume
is going to get a larger viral load
than somebody who happened to be
standing in the same room
but away from
like a temporary plume that got formed
or even just by chance there might be
some pockets that are a little denser
than others
maybe the virus tends to float down
instead of up so maybe the top of the
room above your head
doesn't have much virus
maybe there's a lot of virus you know
below the waist i don't know after a
while
so the question is if you were to take a
room that had maybe some plumes or some
denser areas and you were just to
distribute it by just airflow
not by opening a window
not by modifying your hvac
not by turning on the circulation just a
fan
just fan
could you
spread it around
more efficiently to the point where
maybe there's same the same amount of
covet in the room or coronavirus in the
room
but nobody can get a big enough dose
it just got spread out too much so
that's my hypothesis
hypothesis is that you could measure the
airflow in spaces because devices exist
and that you would find there would be
almost a perfect correlation
between how much the wind is moving the
air
and how often people get infected there
just a hypothesis
but all of it could be easily tested
right
would you agree that this is all
testable and not really hard
i see your pun and it's pretty good
all right
that
concludes
the best part of your day
well maybe you'll have some other good
parts
i i feel good about your chances today
but
until trump gets back into the game we
have to dig a little deeper to find some
interesting stories
and i hope that you've
you've learned that
this presentation is more about keeping
you company
than it is even about the content i mean
i try to make the content interesting
but this is more about meeting every day
here and having having a moment even if
it's recorded
maybe you maybe you consume this while
you're exercising maybe taking a walk
maybe doing some housework or something
but uh i'm here just to be your virtual
friend
um how many of you
have noticed either in yourself or in
others people close to you
a loneliness crisis
how many of you
how many of you are seeing a loneliness
crisis
wow i'm seeing a lot of yeses there
on locals it's just boom boom boom boom
boom yes yes yes yes yes yes
mostly yeses
uh yeah
there's something's happened hasn't it i
don't know if it's just social media i
suspect it's mostly social media but i
feel as if almost everybody feels lonely
now
even if they have social interaction i
don't know how much is the pandemic i
don't know how much is just
where we are as society i don't know
it's because
you don't meet your neighbors
i don't know what it is it could be all
of those things
but the the loneliness thing is just
through the roof
so
as i uh evolve whatever this live stream
is i mean it just started as me turning
on my phone and saying something about
trump years ago
uh
ed how do i persuade my depressed 14
year old daughter who left liberal
public school for a small catholic
school
that's good for her and it'll be okay
because it might not be
we left a liberal public school for a
small catholic
how do i convince her that it would be
okay all right so she's depressed
because she she left her friends right
and
now she has to go somewhere where she
doesn't have friends
my understanding of kids and school is
that all that matters is their friends
back me up parents
nothing else matters right
for somebody in school
a young girl in school
how many friends they have is all that
matters so there's
the only thing you can do is work on
that
and you have to work on the fact that
she'll have friends she'll make friends
she'll make new friends
um you know so basically
help out on the making friends part of
the equation and that's all that matters
and
unfortunately she's not going to be
convinced right away
because until she makes the new friends
it will feel like it's impossible
because it's really hard to break into a
new group
now i would also take the opportunity
um
to educate her on technique
for making friends the dale carnegie
stack how to how to basically walk up to
a stranger and turn them into your
friend mostly by asking questions about
them and not talking about yourself too
much that's that's the short version
so if you were to teach
your child how to make friends
the actual
let's say the components of
friendship
reciprocity sharing a secret
being active inviting and uh you know
making sure that you're
including people you know there's a
number of things that you could probably
throw in there and kids don't have that
skill automatically
if you could teach
your daughter
that that's a learnable skill that she
can just take into this new school and
then acquire a bunch of new friends
because she can
all right
by the way if if you can get your
daughter to listen to this part of it
which i know would be a big ask
parents are have no credibility with
their kids
universally true
but i might have credibility because i'm
a person appearing on a screen so just
show your daughter this and tell her
that
making new friends is a learnable
teachable skill everybody can do it
doesn't require any
native ability just some technique
and once you do it
the world is yours you just go and make
a bunch of friends it just takes so it
takes a little work
but once you have that skill you never
have to worry about not about having a
friend
because you'll learn how to make new
ones and you'll just get new ones all
the time
old ones will fall off
and new ones will come back on just make
it a skill
all right that's all i got for you today
and
um
and i'll talk to you tomorrow see you
youtubers and thanks a lot for the
the tips and stuff i do see them all i
can't read them all because of the flow
of things but i do see them all and i
appreciate it
