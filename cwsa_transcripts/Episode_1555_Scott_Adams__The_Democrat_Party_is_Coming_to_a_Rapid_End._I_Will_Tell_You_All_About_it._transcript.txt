[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever going to
happen to you
until possibly tomorrow i have high
hopes for tomorrow and beyond but for
now this is the peak of your existence
the best day of your life so far
uh and what are we going to do to make
it even better yeah we're not going to
be satisfied don't be satisfied
no
if you want to take it up a level all
you need is a cup or a mug or a glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine end of the day the thing
that makes everything better and
stronger and especially your antibodies
watch this go
ah
yeah that's good
yeah
i don't mean to sound racist but my
white blood cells are
just charging up
all right
is everybody good
how are you all doing
enough about me i mean
really i'm sick of me but are you doing
well today
because i might be the only person who
asks
how many of you think we you'll get a
compliment today from anybody
in the comments tell me how many of you
would expect
to get a compliment today about anything
about anything
me okay
i will every day somebody says
yes
interesting
interesting a number of you expect a
compliment today
now i usually get a compliment just
because i'm a public figure
but i'm kind of surprised that so many
of you expect a compliment many of you
said
no but i'm wondering if the if the
people who said yes are all female
you know
have you ever thought about the uh
we have a standard in society
that women must be complimented on a
like just a continuous
schedule
you gotta gotta compliment women
especially your your significant
other or spouse whatever
and
but it doesn't work the other way does
it
have you noticed that there's no
requirement for complimenting men
that
that
that women are automatically expected to
be complimented that is just the
standard
but man no no in fact
men expect to be insulted don't they
men how many of you expect to be
insulted by the significant person in
your life today like actually just
insulted
some of you all right i won't cause any
more trouble
so i have a strategy for dealing with
climate change and uh
i think it's time to roll it out
um as you know
there seems to be some kind of division
between the young and the old and uh the
younger generation believes
that the older generation has
essentially screwed them
with climate change and they're pretty
mad about it
pretty mad about the boomers
and i thought uh we should take the
fight to them
rather than just being you know boomer
victims if any of you are boomers i'm
just speaking for my people now
but i think we should start
brainwashing the kids
into thinking that the cause of climate
change is
them leaving doors open while the heat's
on
now
remember they're kids so they're not
going to do a deep dive into the science
they'll believe anything you tell them
if you get them young enough that's
that's the trick you got to get them
young
believe anything
really anything
so forget about the science just tell
them that the problem with climate
change is their own damn fault for
continually leaving the door open
while the heat is on
now you don't think that this is a good
idea
what do you think they're going to do to
your social security payments once they
realize you destroyed the planet and
you're planning to die and leave it to
them huh well they're not going to be
happy about it
so i i recommend a preemptive strike
i feel it's inevitable
that the youth of today will get so mad
they will take your social security away
and watch you die in your own
degenerated state
so i think we got to get them first
who's with me
we've got to target the children
and brainwash them into thinking it's
all their fault we can do this
if we all band together
all right we'll work on that
so uh i did a joke on twitter that some
people didn't think was funny
some people didn't think this was funny
but
i believe
that those who didn't think it was funny
have a few things going on that is
different from other people number one
most of them were artists
yes yes they were artists
coincidence probably not
but the other thing is i don't think
they understood the joke and let me tell
you the joke that i tweeted and you tell
me
is this the unfunniest horrible thing
you most horrible thing you've ever
heard
or is it kind of funny all right
which is it going to be
horribly horribly
tasteless or kind of funny
it goes like this i said i hear pfizer
is working on a vaccination that
prevents concerts
now in the comments
can you tell me
what is the point of the joke because
it's a joke with a point
what is the point of the joke anybody
anybody
what is the point of the joke
am i
making fun of people who died at a
concert
is that what i'm doing am i having fun
at the expense of
tragic loss of life
was that the point of the tweet
i see yes
from somebody who obviously works in the
arts
anybody else work in the arts
and think that that's about
no the people on locals especially who
who probably know me best
are kind of shouting the answer it's
about the pharma
it's about the pharma companies
looking for any you know any situation
to sell some drugs
no matter how reasonable it is or no
matter how good it is for you
that's what the joke's about
the joke is about big
pharma now if you're an artist
you think hey
i think he's against music
i think he's against concerts he doesn't
want us to get together and have fun
what's wrong with that cartoonist
no i'm not making fun of tragedy
i'm making fun of the pharma companies
who would make money on any tragedy if
they could
okay
so yes i'm using the event
why
take it to the next level
why
because it was a tragedy
you realize the joke doesn't work
unless we all agree it's a tragedy
right
that's the only we that's the only way
it works is that the person telling the
joke
and the person listening to it
all agree
that the concert was just a tragedy
there's there's nothing else you could
say it was just a tragedy right
so
anyway for those who don't understand
jokes that could be important now here's
the the best thing that came out of that
there was a comment i saw in
the comments to that joke
uh and one of the comments was just one
word
dog bert
just one word
dog bird
now
how many of you get that reference
now i know you know that dog bird is the
character that i draw on the comic strip
but who gets who gets that reference
yeah i wrote it in dogber's voice
exactly
it was written not in my own voice it
was basically written in the voice of
dogber
now who would be smart enough
to make that connection
like what kind of observer would be
smart enough to say oh you just wrote in
dog bird well i had to check the
the profile of the person who said that
because it was just one word and it was
perfect just dog burp
and it was uh brody gupt gupta
b-r-o-t-i broti
gupta who at least in the
it looks like she's a writer for the
simpsons
she's a writer for the simpsons so i'm
going to give her a pass
for being an artist
because if you're if you're writing for
the symptoms simpsons
you're really smart
you're really smart they they only hire
really smart writers
so uh roti
was smart enough not only to know that
it was a joke but that it was written in
dog birth's voice
so she's operating at a whole other
level
that than even the people who got the
joke
and that was correct that was dogbert's
voice
so i called out a potential mass
hysteria i think i think i got this one
right
when the
travis scott concert tragedy start
happened and it was still in the fog of
war we didn't know what was happening
how many of you heard an untrue rumor
that somebody was stabbing people with
fentanyl
or that it was fentanyl deaths and that
in fact they
one of the security or police i forget
was stabbed with a needle
and had to be revived with narcan how
many people believed all that was true
all right
when i was asked when i first started i
said
nope i don't believe that's true
um and i want to give you a uh
a trick for deciding what's true or not
goes like this
imagine you hear a story and you say to
yourself
well there's only one
there's only one explanation for this
and here's the part of the story that
you probably said there's only one
explanation for it
there was a i think it was a police
officer i think it was a police officer
who
collapsed at the concert
and was taken to the emergency room and
revived with narcan
now narcan is a drug you use to revive
people who have fentanyl overdose
so
based on the fact that narcan was used
and seemed to have worked
you could
you could conclude there was probably
fentanyl
but i'm not sure you would know for sure
and maybe people just pop back to life
and you don't know why sometimes i don't
know um i'm not a doctor so i don't know
but that would be the implication that
it must have been fentanyl and then the
medical team
found what they thought was a needle
mark in the neck
and then when they asked them he said
yeah i think i felt something on my neck
so
putting
two plus two plus two together
people thought that the other deaths
might be fentanyl and this guy was
stabbed with a needle and maybe there
was a crazed needle fentanyl guy running
around
all right here's why i knew this wasn't
true
number one
nobody would put a
fentanyl in a needle
deadly amounts
i don't think anybody would do that and
not expect to die themselves
because it's pretty dangerous just to
work with it
so i don't know that anybody would put
it in a needle and that's
because the alternative would be easier
suppose you wanted to kill a bunch of
people with fentanyl how would you do it
well if you had the raw fentanyl you
could put in a needle
it means you have some
some wherewithal right you have some
ability
to manage something with fentanyl
it would be much easier just to buy
pills
fake pills just put a little extra
fentanyl in them
press your own pills
but
you know we didn't see that happening
so here's my little tip
suppose you said to yourself i can't
imagine any other explanation for how
that police officer had a hole in his
neck
it collapsed the fentanyl and was
revived by narcan how can you explain it
any other way anybody
does anybody have an imagination in
which they can explain those facts any
other way
go
it took as it took one second for
somebody on locals to have the right
answer
i'm not i don't want to make an
accusation because there's no evidence
for what i'm going to say next okay so
here's that clearly
what i'm going to say next has no
evidence
i'm just saying that there are different
ways to explain what you observed
let me walk you through one i'm not
suggesting this is what happened
i'm suggesting that if you couldn't
imagine this was a possibility then you
could easily be fooled
it goes like this
how many police officers are taking
drugs
on the job
some right you have to assume that some
drug police officers take drugs
because some of everybody does
there i don't think there's any
profession in which there aren't some
people who come to work high or stoned
or drunk
how many police officers would be more
likely to take let's say a drug that put
them in a good mood if they were going
to be working a concert
probably slightly more what do you think
if you were somebody who took drugs
anyway and you were a police officer and
you thought you were going to spend the
night at a concert just standing around
you might
pop a bar
a bar is a
little uh usually a fake xanax that has
fentanyl in it now you might not know it
has fentanyl in it and you might have
taken it before and said well i'll just
pop a bar it'll take the edge off and
i'll have a good time
good time here
no it's not mind reading it's we're
speculating what another possibility
would be
mind reading is if you actually think
you know what somebody's thinking
i'm just saying there could be another
explanation for the facts that's all now
uh
unfortunately i know what it means to
pop a bar because that's probably what
killed my stepson
so i got too educated on this all right
so let's take the possibility that you
had a police officer who was uh who
took a bar
a little pill
that he thought was going to be safe
enough but it had fentanyl because they
almost all do
and maybe this one had too much now
imagine that this police officer simply
had an overdose
just
popped a bar
had an overdose
that would explain why he collapsed
it would explain the narcan revived him
now explain the hole in his neck go
again i'm not alleging any of this
happened i'm saying it fits the facts as
other explanations also do
why would the uh
why would he have a
a little needle mark in his neck
from the narcan shot somebody says from
the i oh my god
i hadn't thought of that
i don't know where you give the narcan
shot
do you give it in the neck
i don't i don't think that's the answer
but as soon as you said that i thought
to myself oh my god that's actually
possible
totally possible yeah i don't think the
narcan is a needle that you put in the
neck so let's rule that one out what do
you think it could be
exactly the right answer on locals again
that's what you say so you don't get
fired
so imagine you're again i'm not alleging
any of this happened so i don't want to
cast this persians
something happened to a cop
that's all we know we don't know
anything else
but imagine he had taken a bar got
caught had an overdose didn't want to
get fired
so what would he say
he would say
i don't know how that got into my system
but i felt something on my neck you know
it was like a little pinch
and then once he told people that maybe
there was a little something on his neck
do you think they could find it
yeah if you tell somebody that there
might be a needle mark on your body
somewhere not necessarily in the neck
but if you told medical professionals
there might be a needle mark somewhere
in my body
do you think they could find something
they thought was it maybe a needle mark
but not quite sure
yes because it would prime them to look
for something
so the alternate explanation is that the
cop was an addict he took some fentanyl
and he lied when he got to the hospital
and maybe they did or did not see a mark
on his neck but probably it was a
coincidence or confirmation bias
right
now here's the trick
just because you can't imagine
another explanation for a thing
doesn't mean it didn't happen
do you know how magic tricks work a
magic trick works because you the
audience can't imagine
how it got how how it happened
is it's your lack of imagination
that makes magic tricks work
likewise when you see these situations
if you think well there's only one thing
that could have happened
you're you're you're a perfect audience
for a magic trick
because there's always another
explanation that you didn't think of
always there's always another one you
didn't think of and you know i i run
into this too it's not like i don't make
the same mistake all the time
saying well there's only one explanation
i can think of so a better way to say it
is put odds on it
just say well
i don't know that looks like 75 chance
that that's what happened
that'll keep you a little bit out of the
trouble
so trump has basically told us he's
running without telling us he's running
because he says a good time to announce
his intentions would be after the
midterms he's already talking about vice
presidents
he's already decided
if there's anything that i can say with
complete certainty
trump has decided to run
why wouldn't he
why wouldn't he it looks like he can win
right i mean that would be the best
reason to run he would get his revenge
he would get
you know maybe vindicated
he would be
back in the news it would help his it
would help his startup because now he's
got a social media platform he kind of
has to run just for the social media
platform to work because otherwise it'll
just go away
if he doesn't run
so yes he's running unless something
weird happens
right away
he's definitely run
in the meanwhile the democrats are
scared i saw cnn touting the
infrastructure bill as a big big win for
biden
big big win
what do you think
how how many americans think the
infrastructure bill
is
that's the thing
you know i was a little undecided about
biden but we got that infrastructure
bill
nobody
nobody even knows what's in it
the news is going to try to push this
infrastructure bill
as if people care about it
do you know why it took so long to pass
it
because people didn't care about it
if the public really wanted that thing i
think it would have happened sooner the
public didn't care
i mean the few people who follow this
stuff cared
but not the public
you know i don't think more than five
percent of the country even knew there
was an infrastructure bill do you
if you did a survey and said
did you know there was a big vote with
an infrastructure bill
how many people would say oh yeah i've
been following that
five percent
maybe
yeah five percent of most
so
uh if that's what they're they're
holding on to as their victory
good luck because you got
you got parents who can't afford to buy
gas
to drive their little masked
masked up kids
to the place where they are taught that
they're racist and or white people are
racist
think about the things that real people
are concerned about the mandates the
vaccination the mass the schools
crt
gas prices
right inflation
they're not worried at all about the
infrastructure bill
now you know when explained to them they
probably would say oh that's you know i
guess that would be good
but i don't think people care they care
about the crime they care about the
drugs and
none of that's good
right now
so
no surprise that uh well we'll talk
about biden's
ratings in a moment his popularity
so thomas uh massey
representative
massey
says this about the i guess biden wants
to have a
mandate for vaccinations
for any company that's got 100 or more
workers and as thomas massey correctly
states
this is absolutely unconstitutional
is there anybody who disagrees with that
now i guess that way it would be in
forces through osha
but who gave osha
who gave osha the authority to put drugs
in your body
or to require it
who get what part of the constitution
says osha can make you get a vaccination
or anything like it
no
no
and no
so here will be a good test
of what i've been telling you for a
while
that the government is not in charge
this will be the test case
i say that people are in charge
and when the people want something by
enough of a majority if it's 50 50 then
the government is in charge or anything
close to even but as soon as the the
public just totally wants something
then the government will just give it to
them they have to
do you think
the public is going to put up with this
seriously
you think the public is going to put up
with a vaccine mandate
for companies as small as a 100 workers
nope
nope
they are not
this is the red line
so you wondered how far things could get
pushed well you just found it
you just found it this is as far as it
can get pushed
this is the end of the road
this won't go
this isn't going to happen
there will not be an enforced mandate
for vaccines for people with a
hundred workers it's just not going to
happen
now that's my prediction
so either this will be withdrawn
or it will break the system
so i can imagine it would get
implemented
but i think it will break the system
meaning that the system will
just come apart
over this and
uh irma says it happened in australia
what do you say to that americans
now i know you're not all americans
watching this but somebody said it
happened in australia
give me the answer
second amendment
second amendment
do you know does the australian
government have to do what the
australian public tells them to do
nope
they don't
because they have the guns
now i'm not saying that the you know
armed civilians can
have more military might than the actual
military
but that's not
that's not even who they're going to
fight
that wouldn't be the fight because i'm
not even sure the military would be on
the government side in this case and
they're certainly not going to turn on
the public over this
do you think that the military
would mount a response like the american
military do you think they would put
bodies in the street
to support an unconstitutional rule from
the government
would our would the american military
and force an unconstitutional one that's
obviously unconstitutional
i don't think you have to be a scholar
to know this is unconstitutional
no
oh
so australia
might learn the difference between
america and australia
and i think they're going to learn that
because
there's a reason
so many americans have guns
it's this
i mean lots of other reasons too
but this is a big one
because when the americans want the
government by enough of a majority when
a majority of americans want the
government to do something it's going to
do it
it's going to do
it so
my confidence is unfounded
well that let's let's make it a
prediction
okay
so my prediction is that this will
either be withdrawn
or modified in some way that makes it
more palatable i suppose or
um
[Music]
or
it'll break the system so it might
temporarily
you know be implemented but it's just
not gonna work it's gonna break the
system
and um
this is just purely a red line you know
it's one
let me say this
as often as i need to
in the context of an emergency
i'm comfortable
giving power to the government because
you need quick decisions and i'm even
comfortable knowing they'll make
mistakes
because in an emergency everybody makes
mistakes so you're just doing the best
you can
but we're now informed enough and enough
time has gone by we're not really making
emergency decisions anymore
so this is not really the time for the
government to be making these decisions
i mean it needs to be started to be
delegated down to other citizens
and this is the time it's time for the
citizens now i think what's going to
happen if i had to make a guess i think
the therapeutics will come online
we'll have new therapeutics and then
that will be
the cover
for them to back down on this
i think the cover will be oh we got
these new therapeutics
well i guess this mandate isn't as
important as we thought it was before
so i think the therapeutics will give
them the exit ramp to back down from
this i think
all right
glenn greenwald is living my personal
nightmare
do you ever have the nightmare where
you can see the monster but nobody
listens to you
yeah have you ever had that one
can't everybody see there's a monster in
the room why am i the only one who can
see it why aren't you acting worried
have you had that one
all right well that's the sort of a
classic one i've had that one
and i think glenn greenwald is
experiencing that because he keeps
talking about the fact
that it is now obvious and a matter of
fact i would say
that the
the the american intel agencies
department of justice
democrats and the media
colluded to
run a coup
against trump
and maybe succeeded
trump's not in office
and and greenwald just keeps tweeting
and writing about it
but it's not it's not having the
response you'd expect
meaning that the public is just like
yeah
i think i'll buy some christmas presents
no way didn't you hear me
that there's this most awful thing
that's happened and it's still happening
and there's nothing that would stop it
from
continuing it's the worst most terrible
thing that's ever happened to this
country far worse than watergate and it
really matters because it's affecting
you right now
and the public says
i didn't see anything about it on cnn
so we've reached a point
where
the the news business can disappear
not just any just not just an
embarrassing story
but the biggest story of the last five
years
they're making it disappear right in
front of you
that's actually happening
now what does that tell you about all
your priorities
that come from listening to the news
they're all assigned
how long have i been telling you that
your opinions are assigned to you by the
media
not every one of you right some of you
might be exceptions but
probably not
probably not
and so the media has decide decided that
it won't assign the opinion that
something bad happened
they will only assign the opinion that
there are lots of
details coming out
and do what you want with them but we're
not going to tell you that it's
important or that it's the biggest thing
that's happened in i don't know 10 years
if you don't count wars
or terrorism
it's the biggest story of the last
five years 10 years 20.
it's bigger than watergate
so it's the biggest political story by
far
right january 6
if you were to compare the january 6th
event
on a scale of 1 to 10 that's like a 1.
and the russia collusion hoax was
attempt
because one of them was an actual
genuine attempt to overthrow the
freaking government
and it looks like it worked
looks like it worked
because it wounded trump enough that he
lost the election
so i think it was a successful coup
attempt
and that's not even in the news
and i don't think there's anything
that's going to change it because even
the right-leaning media isn't treating
it
the way i would treat it
so maybe everybody's waiting for durham
maybe there's some confirmation
somebody's waiting for i don't exactly
know what's going on
but i have some theories about why the
the public
uh finds us invisible
number one
the story is too big
to grasp
so i'm going to give you a few different
explanations but one of them is the
story is too big to grasp
not just complicated that's another
problem it's complicated so people can't
hold it on their heads but it's actually
too big
it would be as if we found out that all
along
the the presidents have always been
lizard people from another planet
you almost couldn't deal with it your
brain wouldn't know what to do
wait you're telling me that all of our
past presidents have actually literally
been lizard people from another planet
and we now have proof of it
your brain wouldn't be able to process
that
you just couldn't handle it
and so you would just go do something
else
you would just go on with your day
because you can't handle it
it's only the little outrages that we
can handle it's like oh
there's a there's what you think is a
man in a dress when the restroom so
you're all worked up about that or
somebody now
they were kneeling for the flag or
stop kneeling from my flag
afghanistan withdrawal was bad for her
these are all tiny
compared to the news that's being hidden
from you
so one is it's just too big we can't
wrap our heads around it and the other
is and it's complicated
and the other is the news simply decided
it wasn't going to be the news so they
just told you it wasn't news and now it
isn't
just not news
amazing
all right well i don't think we should
call it the
russian russia collusion coup or russian
collusion hoax it was a coup attempt
i think
all right rasmussen uh
tells us that uh 57 of those polls say
they don't want any
settlement payments to immigrants who
are separated at the border
so do you think anything can happen
if 57 percent of the public doesn't want
it to happen
can it happen
this one could
because this is not quite passing the
pain level
this could actually happen
57 is on the border of being enough
people against it but it's not enough i
think you need around 70 of the public
to hate something before it won't happen
but certainly 57 is enough is is enough
to guarantee that the
democrats won't win any elections
anytime soon
i'm pretty sure that this issue is a
really good one
and
how many of you saw the peter ducey
uh question and answer at the last press
conference uh so it was
whoever is the stand-in speaker for uh
jen saki i don't know her name but
whoever the current fill-in is for that
peter ducey esser is there any
discussion of giving money to uh
immigrants who come here legally
a brilliant question
because you know the the whole point of
these press conferences is to get the
is to get the the sound clip
like you want to be the one who says the
clever thing
this is really clever
really clever all right here's how it
goes
he says is there any discussion of
giving money to immigrants who come here
legally
and the
spokesperson looks at him and says
why would we give money to people who
come here legally
and peter ducey without missing a beat
says
why would you give money to people who
come here illegally
that's really good
oh
my god that's so good
now is it fair
no
no it's a totally unfair statement right
because it
uh ducey's comment
it's a it's a 10 out of 10 for
public zingers
but you know it doesn't really
pass any uh any kind of
rational analysis
um
the the reason that the illegal
immigrants uh
would get money is because you know some
crime was done against them
uh meaning the the separations
so since that didn't apply to the legal
immigrants the whole question didn't
make any sense but
it sure sounded good on video
so if your job is to look good that you
asked the right question he just nailed
it
and it was a setup right
i assume he had he had that answer like
uh locked and loaded right
like he knew what her answer was going
to be and so he he already had the
answer that was really good
anyway
um cnn's sounding the alarm again
according to a usa today's suffolk
university poll
uh biden's approval
rating is 37.8
he's got a 59 disapproval
that's pretty bad
really really bad
and 46 percent of those said
biden has done a worse job well that's
probably just lines up with
political uh parties
and 64 said they don't want biden to run
for re-election but i think that's more
to do with this age
you know that's all of the republicans
plus a few democrats who think he's too
old
so that doesn't mean much
so here's my
bottom line
given biden's popularity level and given
that the democrats in congress have done
nothing but fight with each other and
get us an infrastructure bill we should
have gotten three years ago
i don't see how democrats could
keep control after the primaries or
sorry after the
midterms
and i don't see how they could win the
presidency unless
they come up with a new hoax
so one would imagine
um
that even now
they're concocting they meaning the
media plus our intelligence agencies
plus the doj
you know plus the dems there it's
obvious they're probably cooking up a
new
attack against trump but here's the
problem
every attack that they've used on trump
so far
wasn't enough
so everything he's already done
apparently had no
influence on him doing his job as
president
right so if you said to yourself hey
what about that trump university thing
well before he was president in the
first place before he'd ever been
president that was a fair question
right i mean i didn't even bother trying
to defend him on that one
that was a fair question
but if you've served as president for
four years
does that matter anymore
i mean it didn't matter to the first
four years of his performance
why why would it matter for another four
years
so all those things that were pretty
good points before he had ever been
president don't make any sense after
he's done the job because once he's done
the job you just say well
how do you do
that's the only thing we care about and
how he did
was better than biden on everything that
matters
now biden's going say the stock market
went up
all right
i'm not i'm not sure that's the home run
that everybody expects given that you
know spending is out of control and
inflation and all that
so i think that uh um
we don't have really
there's really no mystery left
is there you know how the at this point
we know how the midterm elections will
go
here's but here's how trump could lose
it
he could say or suggest something that's
just too far
now
i'm not going to be the idiot
who who says you know
all trump needs to do is just
cool it and he just walks back into the
job
now and by the way
that's completely true
if trump and this will never happen so
forget about dreaming about this
if trump simply decided to cool down the
rhetoric
and said you know i don't need to be on
twitter and i don't think i'll put out
these statements unless it's policy
related and he just played it straight
there's a hundred percent chance you'd
be elected am i wrong
is there anybody here who thinks that
trump
wouldn't get elected if he just you know
played it right down the middle
because that alone would be hilarious
because cnn would go crazy
they're like oh he's playing it down the
middle
when he ran the first time he needed to
be outrageous to set himself apart
right
so all of his outrageousness fit
perfectly
with strategy
and the thing that trump doesn't get
credit for that i think maybe his
strongest feature
is he is really strategic
and he knows people and how people you
know the psychology and stuff
so he's really good at that
he knew he needed to be outrageous the
first election
does he know that that wouldn't work as
well
if he runs a second time
does he know that
and if he knows that
can he change
i don't know trump is trump the the the
reason people like him is they know
exactly what they're getting
there's no mystery there at all
and
uh so i don't i don't believe that he
can calm down his rhetoric i don't think
that's an option
but he wouldn't need to use rhetoric to
get elected this time
let me ask you if if trump didn't run
and ron desantis did
could ron desantis get elected yeah
yeah
kind of easily i think
i think ron desantis would just stroll
into the job at this point because the
democrats have done such a bad job
the only thing that could keep trump out
of that job is either not running
or to
do something that can be turned into a
new scandal and make it easy for them to
turn it into a scandal because they got
nothing else
by now the all the opposition research
must be exhausted on trump what else do
they have
all they have is his record and it looks
pretty good compared to biden
yeah so he says the sociopath is
authentic
well i would say that um the interesting
thing about trump and i'll remind you
for those who've forgotten is that he he
may have been the
president who violated the fact-checking
the most
of any president i don't know if that's
true but let's say it is he may have
violated the fact-checking more than any
president
at the same time
i think he did
he tried harder to keep his promises
than anything i've ever seen would you
agree with that take
even the things he didn't get done
the effort was clearly there
i mean the wall i mean he really pushed
on that
didn't work
you know in the end
yeah
um
so anyway we'll we'll see what happens
elon musk
was some interesting talk because he
changed his twitter
handle
so instead of saying elon musk it now
says lord edge
and lord is spelled with an e on the end
of lord
lord edge
why'd he do that
why did he do that well he's always
interesting so it could have been
you know he was just stoned and he
thought it'd be funny
but
of course everybody said ah it's
uh it's an anagram or something if you
arrange the letters you can find out
what it really is how long did it take
you to arrange the letters and find out
if there was a secret message there
well it didn't take me long
and i'd like to think
that elon musk is giving everybody an iq
test
to find out who to hire for uh tesla
and anybody who can solve this this
puzzle
get a job offer that's not true but it's
fun
so
here's what you can rearrange these
letters into so the if you want to do
this at home it's lord edge
but lord has an e on the end
if you arrange those you can use all
those letters and
it spells
elder doge
d-o-g-e elder doge or doge elder either
way
now you might know that uh yulan has
talked quite a bit about doge coin
d-o-ge
more typically just called doge
and
um he seems to be sort of the
the doge elder
so is it a coincidence
that these letters could form elder doge
and that there's no other obvious reason
why it would be
or edge lord
yeah edge lord is funny it's good too
doge not barking
all right
i don't think there's any importance to
this maybe he's signaling that he's
going to accept doge for
teslas or something but um
i think i think he's just having fun and
he's good at it
all right that
um
that
is my message for the day
now if i can give some uh campaign
advice to
uh mr trump it would be this
stop
saying the 2020 election was stolen
you can still believe it and if somebody
asks you directly and you still think
it's true yeah say yes
but
including it in the rallies now is a
mistake
because here's what that should turn
into
they should turn into i'm gonna do i'm
gonna make the elections uh auditable
all right so 2020 is over it happened
we're running we're running it for a new
election
this system picked to the system picked
and we must respect the system but we
can improve the system
and well he would never say he respected
that system i'm sure
but
if he if he simply promises was what we
want
which is not really to live in the past
i don't really need i don't even need
i just don't need to know if 2020 was
rigged or not
even if you could find out even if it
was i just don't need to know it it's
the past
i want to know what he's going to do in
the future and if in the future he's the
only one promising to
fix the elections
not fix the elections but fix the
election process so that they could be
instantly audited which they cannot be
then he would have my full support
but i'm gonna i'm gonna mess with you a
little bit harder
if he doesn't do that
but some democrat runs against him
who promises to fix the elections and is
credible about it i don't know who it
would be
i mean maybe bernie
i mean he's too old to run but somebody
like a bernie i would say to myself you
know i think bernie actually means it
like you could imagine somebody running
as a democrat that you would actually
believe it's like holy cow
that that democrat's making a big deal
about election integrity i might i might
actually vote for that
because you got to save the republic
first
right
like all all of the other
policies and stuff are very important
but you got to save the republic
and if you don't have an election system
you're not going to keep your republic
very long so that's that's sort of where
we are at the moment we need somebody
who would just go in there and say i'm
just going to fix this election thing
somebody said tulsi
well that's interesting now i don't know
if she has enough support from
democrats but that would certainly make
her popular with some republicans
that would be an interesting choice
yes
and
if uh trump has also been asked whether
desantis would be a good vp pick and he
said he likes desantis
but there are other good people
and uh
so he's i think he's leaning in that
direction again
all right
um
blockchain a blockchain election system
yeah i don't know if we need our
presidents to tell us what technology to
do i think they need to set a direction
maybe fund it help fund it
maybe report on it that sort of thing
tulsi and crenshaw the i don't know
is that really the dream team
i mean they both have a lot of good
qualities but i don't know if if the two
of them together i don't know if they
make each other stronger
all right um
all right uh
just looking at some of your
uh comments here
um i think i'll get andy here
go do some other things
and
go have an amazing amazing day
and by the way if somebody ever forms a
competing party called the middle party
it would be a winner
that's all for now goodbye youtube
