hey everybody
come on in gather around grab a chair
it's time for coffee with scott adams
the best time of the day dr drew glad to
see you
come on in well today is a special day
full of interesting news but most
importantly i'm going to tell you how to
fix
everything and before that we get to
that
let's enjoy it to its maximum potential
and all you need is a copper mug or
glass a tanker chelsea steiner canteen
jogger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the day the
thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous hip it happens now go
what's the slaughter meter somebody says
well you know it's interesting
if you make a prediction about the
outcome of the election
but you're not entirely sure
if everything's been audited as much as
it could be
is the prediction wrong or is it hard to
measure
so let's talk about all the things big
news today
i think you heard trump got impeached
for a second time
you know i don't hate that at all
it has nothing to do with what trump did
or didn't do
i kind of liked the fact that he got
impeached twice
it feels better than once am i the only
one who feels that
because if you get impeached once
what does history make of it i think
they say well
probably did something to deserve
getting impeached that would be the
first thing you'd assume right
because impeachment's pretty serious if
you're gonna impeach somebody
you probably put some thought into it
and you know made an argument etc
so if you're impeached once that feels
really really bad on your record
but if you're impeached twice
and especially if the last one is a week
before you get
leave office does that say something
about
trump or does that say something about
impeachment see where i'm heading
i think he came out ahead now i know i'm
the guy
everybody mocks for spinning things
pro-trump no matter what it is
no matter what it is but i'll just put
that out there
if it were me if i were in his position
i would much prefer being impeached
twice
because the second one is so obviously
it makes the first one look like
 see where i'm going here
two impeachments obviously just
political one impeachment
um maybe he did something worth
impeaching
it just makes the credibility of the
whole thing so much less
so and and i also like the fact that
trump is a sort of a
person of extremes and a person of
records
good records bad records but records
he's a guy who sets all kinds of records
i kind of like the fact that he has the
record for impeachments
because it does tell the story better
than if he only had one
if he has the record well then he's
truly a
uh let's say a disruptive character
if he just has one maybe he just did
something wrong
all right uh jack dorsey made a large
largest statement on twitter about the
banning of trump from twitter and i like
to look at these
ceo statements about controversial
controversial items to see how they did
just to see how the communication went
whether it's persuasive
so separating from the topic i'm just
going to talk about
whether the communication was done well
uh skipping to the final vote it was
done well
it's an impossible situation meaning
that
um twitter and the others
they really didn't have a a clean
winning path
so anybody who thinks oh just take the
easy path why didn't you do that
there was an obvious solution but you
did the wrong thing
that's not really what's happening here
but twitter basically had two bad
choices
and had to pick one they didn't have the
choice of not picking
because not picking a choice is a choice
to so here's how
jack does this and here's i'll read some
of the highlights from his
uh thread and i want you to see the
technique
because it's really good all right now
if you can separate from a moment
what you currently feel about twitter
and what you think about
jack dorsey what you think about trump
just separate from that for a moment
we'll just talk about the persuasion
part just the skill all right
forget about the politics we'll just
talk about the skill
the skill in this is extreme it's really
good
the first thing you need to do if you
were going to deal with
something this controversial is you have
to acknowledge
the complaining side it is not good
technique
to say something like somebody is
complaining
therefore we're going to do x y z it's
not good enough
just to note that there are problems or
complaints
you need to describe the complaint
in your own words as clearly as the
complainers
describe it right so if you can't put it
in your own words
what the other people are saying about
you it doesn't look like you understand
it
or accept it or treat it as valid so
that's the first thing you look for
and jack did that perfectly actually in
a few different ways let me give you
some quotes
he says you know he goes i do not
celebrate or feel pride in our
having to ban uh trump so the very first
sentence is
he's telling you he's not happy about it
that's pacing
because he knows the people who are
looking at this are not happy about it
so the first thing he says is i'm not
happy about it either
that's good good good technique he's not
happy about it either
his his reasons may be different than
yours but we'll get to that
he says that they made the decision with
the best information they had based on
threats
threats to physical safety blah blah
and then he asked the question was this
correct
now have i told you the uh the technique
of saying what people are thinking the
moment they're thinking it it's a really
strong communication technique
it binds you to the listener so at the
very moment that jack says in his tweet
thread
was this correct is exactly the moment
you were thinking it
see so he says you know we made this
decision based on our best information
and the moment you read that you're
saying yeah but was it correct
and then he says was that was this
correct
it's exactly the right sentence in
exactly the right place
if you don't sort of study this stuff
you don't see how well this is
constructed it's actually engineered
really really well so we'll get to some
more
he says i believe this was the right
decision for twitter
the right decision for twitter that's
very transparent
because what he did not say he did not
say
i think it was the right decision for
the country and later he goes on saying
maybe it wasn't the right decision for
the country maybe we need to do better
but he says directly i believe this was
the right decision for twitter
now was it are you a ceo
do you know if this was the right
decision for twitter would twitter as a
company
pursuing profits within a capitalist
system which is their right
was this the right decision and i i feel
like
maybe maybe yes maybe now
i'm not really sure but i don't take
that decision away from twitter i mean
it's their decision right
what i don't have a better idea i might
have played it differently
but i don't know if that would have been
better for twitter
so i think it's very transparent and i
appreciate
that the first thing he says is i think
we made the right decision
for twitter which is his job
his job is to make good decisions for
twitter
maybe he did maybe he didn't i don't i
don't feel i have insight into that
and he talks about the an extraordinary
and untenable circumstance meaning there
wasn't any way to
do everything right that wasn't really
an option and that they
basically took um the reduction
of harm as their highest priority
pretty good right now if you were making
the decision
you might have said you know free speech
it has some rough edges you know maybe
i'd prefer free speech even if people
get hurt
maybe i free i prefer free speech even
if people get killed
i still might prefer it but that's
something you can say
as an individual right that's not
really something you can say if you're a
leader
exactly because you can't be in favor of
anybody getting killed under any
circumstances
so they had an untenable
situation and and he says they have to
reflect on their operations and the
environment around it
um he acknowledges that it's um
has a negative impact on the public and
that
it's a pretty big one so he's not he's
not
minimizing whatsoever that
this has an impact on free speech that
could be a big big
big big deal so he's saying it directly
that's good technique because that's
what you're thinking right you're
thinking it's a big
big big deal and he acknowledges it so
that's good technique
um and he says
and this i think this part i like the
most
because just listen to this how well
this is constructed he says the check
and accountability on this power
the power of twitter to you know ban
people or not ban people
has always been the fact that a service
like twitter is one
small part of a larger public
conversation happening across the
internet
if folks do not agree with our rules and
enforcement they can simply go to
another internet service
now you don't agree with that right
here's the second part
the second part is he doesn't agree with
it either he's going to agree with you
now
watch how good this is he says this
concept
meaning the concept that you could just
go somewhere else if you don't like
twitter
was challenged this week when a number
of foundational internet
tool providers the social media
platforms meaning also decided not to
host what they found dangerous
i do not believe this was coordinated i
agree with him that
you know there wasn't like a meeting to
to talk about it
more likely companies came to their own
conclusions and were emboldened by the
actions of others
i think that's actually the way i see it
i don't think they needed a meeting
because you don't need to have a meeting
and collude on something that you all
kind of are gonna just go the same
direction anyway
so um so he's basically
debunking the argument that
twitter could ban you and then you could
just go somewhere else
because now we've seen in the real world
that if there's something big enough for
twitter to ban you you're probably going
to be banned on the other platforms
or at least they'll be emboldened to do
that so he's
acknowledging that that argument doesn't
work and that was always their best
argument
so what have you ever seen the ceo
respond
to a major public uprising
by saying that their own argument
doesn't work
i've never seen it before i've seen
people admit mistakes
but i've never seen anybody say our own
argument doesn't work
here's why it's kind of remarkable
and again try to separate from what you
feel about twitter or feel about
trump feel about jack dorsey just look
at the technique
it's kind of extraordinary um
and then he talks about what they're
going to do about it which is the next
part of a good
ceo response so they've got some kind of
an
effort that they're ramping up for uh
some kind of a service that
they would be a client of their own
their own entity
well i don't know who owns the entity
that might be
uh there's a question there but the
point is there's some
plan that twitter's doing to address
directly the free speech
things so that everybody can get their
free speech
but twitter could also be protected and
you as a user can see what you want to
see
so they've got something they're working
on i don't know how long that's going to
take
i'd like you know be better to have some
transparency on that
but as a response i thought it was
excellent uh
it's a complete acceptance of the
situation that's about as good as you
can do
completely accepting the complaints and
telling you what they're going to do
about it
right you can hate you can hate
everybody but this is good technique
all right um i tweeted yesterday that
this was the low point
in the biden presidency yesterday
and he hasn't even started the job what
do you think about an incoming president
uh biden who won't stop this impeachment
when he knows it's going to lead to
division he knows it has no purpose and
he said so basically
he basically said out loud he's not
really so much in favor of the
impeachment
he's just seems like he doesn't care but
that's not too much leadership i feel as
if biden could have stepped in and said
look it's time for healing
my entire proposition was healing and
getting rid of the division
so we're not going to pursue this
because there's not enough of an upside
but there's definitely a downside
there's just not much of an upside
so let's not do more division for that
little bit of gain you think you're
going to get
that would have been presidential and
indeed
i would have been a little bit impressed
not going to lie if biden had done that
i would have reassessed his entire
starting presidency i would have said to
myself huh
that actually is what's good for the
country
but he didn't do that is clearly what's
best for the country
is to not do the impeachment and try to
move on because all the impeachment does
is it guarantees that you're going to
get more and more trump
past the inauguration because now the
senate is going to give him a platform
so i would say it's the worst day of the
biden presidency i don't know if you'll
ever do worse than this i mean it's
pretty bad
and at the same time well we'll talk
about that later
um so
what is the price to the country of the
congress
focusing on impeachment well here's a
little report on twitter
that uh secretary gene scalia i guess
he's a
must be in the cabinet or something he
asked for recently asked for two billion
dollars from congress
to fix the state unemployment system
and they were not able to persuade
congress so we asked for two billion
dollars recently to fix this system
didn't get it now that's not too unusual
right
it's not terribly unusual that you'd ask
for two billion dollars and somebody
would say no
except that there was a strong case that
spending 2 billion would have saved 10
billion meaning that it was a new system
that would get rid of the fraud
and they can measure the fraud and it's
around 10 billion
so just think of this your congress if
you're american
your congress didn't have the capacity
to say yes
to spending two billion dollars to save
ten
didn't have the capacity now is that a
hard decision
do you want to spend two to make ten
that wasn't even a hard decision neither
was it political
is there a democrat position to saving
10 billion no
is there a republican who's opposed to
it no
your congress is so obsessed
uh that's a persuasion word i'll take
obsessed away
they're focusing on uh
impeachment at the expense of doing even
things that everybody agrees on
that is as incompetent as you could
possibly get
you how could you become more
incompetent than that
that's what they're giving you
so i it feels like the the impeachment
of trump is really an impeachment of
free speech
wouldn't you say it feels like a
continuation of impeachment of free
speech
uh yeah patrick byrne didn't he get
kicked off of twitter recently too
so there does seem to be an impeachment
going on but it doesn't feel like it's
so much about trump
it feels like it's a free speech thing
because when you say that if you say
what you believe to be true
is incitement and you're going to get
impeached for it
because you think it's true your meaning
is election
fraud claims uh that really is
impeaching free speech
that's not so much about the person it
is working
free speech is actually going away while
we watch
funniest story is that whoever stole the
lectern
pelosi's lectern during the capital
assault
twitter user john henry humerusly notes
that
they got it back and he says breaking
florida man's reign comes to an end
gainesville florida the power of the
united states federal government
has finally been wrestled out of the
hands of a florida man
marking an official end to his brutal
reign
so all the people who think that there
was something like a coup
or an insurrection was pretty much
limited to taking a lectern as a
as a souvenir now
a lot of people think that if you get
the magic lectern you actually run the
country
but no it turns out that having the
lectern
did not give him the nuclear codes now i
don't know if you knew that
came as a big surprise to the democrats
that having full control over the magic
lectern
not as important as you'd think turns
out you can't
can't order the army to do anything he
probably tried
so um all right
uh i was i was mildly in favor of
impeaching trump
for inciting violence that led to the
you know the capital
assault until i heard their argument
after listening to the democrats argue
why he should be impeached
i thought to myself uh you already had
me
you already had me and how hard is it to
get me
i mean for god's sakes if you can get me
to say that trump should be impeached
stop selling you've already made the
sale
stop selling but did they stop selling
they did not they kept selling
and in their selling they proved beyond
any doubt that i have
i mean you might have a different
experience but they removed any doubt
i had that is just revenge
and it's just political i was completely
on board when they were talking about
real things
should the pres this is sort of the
geraldo view which i share
which is although the president's words
had nothing in them
to incite violence directly
he should have known that just being
involved the way he was
created a dangerous situation and i
and my opinion was well that's true i
feel as if he should have known
that the way he played it created a
little more danger than was necessary
even though his words did not incite
violence
and directly said be peaceful
very directly he said be peaceful but
still
should have known i would have known
i think you would have known i feel like
he should have known that there was a
little danger involved in that
all right so if that was the argument
that they had used they already had to
be sold
now i had said before that if it were
the beginning of his term that i might
think differently but i don't care if he
gets
impeached three days before before he's
gone anyway
you know it makes it funnier two
impeachments is funnier than one it
helps them more than rehearse them i
don't care
but as soon as i heard them sell it it
was so obviously
demented evil poorly conceived
revengey emotional
now i'm fully against it now he got
impeached anyway so it doesn't matter
what i think
but uh don't this is a good example of
why you don't
keep selling after you've made the sale
because
everything you say after that might hurt
you like you did here
but it's not going to help you you
already made the sale
extreme incompetence by the democrats
just making their arguments in public
i saw a cnn piece that
in which a person on the street was
talking to trump supporters
and the cnn's person asked this question
quote what if you found down trump was
lying to you about the election being
stolen
and they asked that hypothetical
question what if you found out trump was
lying
now correct me if i'm wrong cnn and the
other
news sites that are anti-trump don't
they report
that trump is lying about his election
fraud claims
they don't say he believes it but he's
wrong
they say he's lying which was such a
tell for propaganda
because uh my take on it is that all the
evidence suggests he believes it
all evidence suggests he believes that
the election was stolen
just like tens of millions of other
americans
also believe it and when they say it
they're not lying they believe it they
could be wrong
they can be right but they're not lying
it's what they actually believe
now when you change somebody's honest
belief which might be right
might be wrong into their lying
that's just propaganda because you're
not a mind reader and there's no
evidence of lying
there's plenty of evidence that he
believes it
as in all of it a hundred percent of
everything you see
suggests that the president absolutely
believes it
just like tens of millions of other
voters believe it as well
so cnn decides that they'll just try to
get away with calling it a lie
and you won't notice there's no evidence
that there's a lie
there is evidence that it might not be
true that's not a lie
so here's the little thread that i did
people liked it a lot this morning so
i'll just go over it
here's how you can tell you're in a
propaganda
bubble as opposed to being in a world
with real news
and i go here's six reasons fake news
tells you trump is lying about the
election stolen as opposed to
actually believing it the way tens of
millions of people do that's an obvious
tell
for that's an example where the news
is not even really trying to be anything
but propaganda
because if they were trying they
wouldn't be calling it a lie
they'd say it's just he's saying it and
it's not true
in their opinion if that's what they
believe to be true number two
um the fake news tells you all of the
election fraud claims have been rejected
by the courts
but where is the master list have you
seen it have you seen the list of all
the
election fraud complaints and then
a list of all the courts that have ruled
so you can see that all the
all the complaints have been ruled on
and rejected
have you seen it well if you haven't
seen it
and you watch the news as much as i do i
haven't seen it
wouldn't you assume it doesn't exist
right now soon after i put out this
tweet
i was contacted by let's say a
prominent member of our government to
say that that list does exist and
he he could provide it to me now
i haven't looked at it yet but i do know
that whatever that list
includes it does not include we looked
at the
source code of the digital systems
involved in voting
because i know that didn't happen and if
you didn't look at the source code
do you really know what did or did not
happen in the election
now not looking at the source code
doesn't tell you
there was any problem it just tells you
you don't know
so apparently there is some kind of a
large list
i'll look at it and i'll let you know
how many of the claims it looks like it
did address
but we know it didn't didn't address at
least
i don't know three quarters of the votes
which probably were went through so well
a hundred percent of the votes went
through some kind of digital system
at one point so
uh that's an open question i have all
right so here's some more of the uh
six points that oh here it is
[Applause]
so then i also said you're in a
propaganda bubble if uh
if knowing you are inciting domestic
violence is a standard
for impeachment and that's what's
happening
what happened with trump is that they
said well he knew that what he was
saying would incite violence therefore
he's guilty of it but that
that that standard needs to apply to
everybody or else it's just propaganda
if you applied the same standard to uh
harrison biden
pushing the fine people hoax and uh
supporting the blm
riders harris actually started helped
start a fund i think
to bail out some of the bad actors in
antifa
and black lives matter so if it's
if inciting violence is a standard that
we accept for impeachment you have to
impeach
everybody who did it otherwise it's just
propaganda
so given that there's no interest
whatsoever on the democrats
of policing it within their own ranks
you can't call that news that's just
propaganda
um if there's no acknowledgement that
the fine people hoax
is still the most damaging fake news in
the history of america
that's not any attempt to be a news
organization that's propaganda
because the the fine people hoax is the
most uh
well-documented easy to debunk hoax and
cnn still reports it like it's real
that's how you know you're in a
propaganda bubble um
in 2016 when trump won the fake news
said definitely
russia interfered and that interference
definitely made the difference
and yet when biden wins suddenly russia
doesn't have any role
that whatever they did didn't make any
difference
so that's how you know you're in a
propaganda bubble because either russia
is trying to change things or they're
not
either it's working or it isn't but it's
going to be the same
ish or at least you would have to
address why you thought it was different
nothing it's just that russia was a
problem now they're not
blah blah don't look over here
propaganda bubble
and of course the big one is when the
fake news labels the capital
assault i'll call it an assault uh a
coup
or when they call it an insurrection
how did they think these protesters were
planning to
conquer and hold power from a superpower
by occupying a few empty rooms and
stealing
a lectern did they think that those
plastic ties would be enough to
secure the entire military of the united
states
or do they think the military was going
to join them
exactly how is this supposed to be a
coup because i don't think i've ever
seen a coup that didn't bring
weapons yeah too many people did have
weapons but it's obvious they were not
planning to use them
offensively they were you know they used
some clubs and stuff and they did kill
people
and they need to go to jail for that
anybody who was involved in that
that does be treated with extreme
prejudice but
it didn't look like they were preparing
to take over a country
i didn't see that because if they did
they're really bad at planning and i
don't think that's the case there were a
lot of military people there
ex-military etcetera if they wanted to
take over the country
if they wanted to do a coup if they
wanted it to be an insurrection
it would have looked a lot different a
lot different
somebody's prompting me in the comments
that the uh
the trouble there was planned long
before trump had made comments
i don't totally buy that that matters to
the argument
i think it's true i just don't know that
it matters to the argument
because whether or not they had planned
something
trump was still saying things and the
things he was saying a reasonable person
could have said yeah
you could have told them to stay home
right
so there's there's a room for judgment
on that
all right here's the important part uh
i'm going to tell you the one and only
way
that republicans can get back something
like a country
in other words how can they get out of
the wokeness
cycle how do they get out of the end of
free speech
what would be a strategy that the
republicans can use
strategy they're trying to use is the
hypocrisy or
argument you just saw me use it right
now
the hypocrisy argument lindsey graham
also has
used it he says if you want to end the
violence end impeachment
now lindsey graham i would say a
credible person even if you don't agree
with him
he's a credible person who understands
the world he has just stated to
democrats
that pursuing impeachment will incite
violence
they did it anyway now
does the hypocrisy claim move the needle
does it solve anything no claiming
hypocrisy
and blaming somebody of being a
hypocrite has
no persuasive power it has no political
weight
nobody in the history of the world has
ever won an argument or changed anything
because of claiming even accurately
claiming hypocrisy on the other side
it's a complete empty strategy it can't
work
it's worth noting so you shouldn't
ignore it
but don't think it's some kind of a
strategy it's not going to change
anything
if you want to change something i
believe we're down to one choice
you know and i'm here i'm ruling out
anything like a like a coup
i'm ruling out any kind of violence i'm
ruling out all the crazy stuff
if you want to live in a real world with
real rules
and you don't want one side to be
beating the other side
like a like a seal
there's only one strategy that could
work
and i've mentioned this before in the
context of my first job as a bank
teller and the strategy is aggressive
compliance with the rules and here's how
it worked when i was a bank teller we
had a whole bunch of rules about what we
could or could not do
in terms of dealing with the customers
so you know if they didn't have two ids
you couldn't cash the check
if they didn't bank here you couldn't do
this if the amount was over a number you
had to get signatures
so we had all these restrictive rules of
what you could or could not do
but they were so restrictive that if you
actually followed them all
you couldn't do anything you wouldn't be
able to do your job at all
you're just every single customer you'd
have to call a supervisor
so you quickly learn to bend the rules
when
let's say it's a customer that you've
waited on 15 times
and you've seen their two ids before
well
you don't need to ask for the second id
if you've checked the same person and
you know them personally
because they come to your window all the
time it's like okay i'll just check one
id
i literally know your last name as soon
as you walked up here
now would that be a security problem
obviously not
obviously bending that little rule was
just good for the customer
good for the bank good for me
but what happened when i got in trouble
for doing
some other bent rule well as soon as i
got in trouble
i and the other teller said you know
it's a good idea we should follow all
these rules
and so i would call a supervisor for
every transaction
because that was the rule i wasn't
making up stuff
the rule was oh i can't do this i'd
better call it
a supervisor at the same time all the
other tellers in the line
were also calling the supervisor for the
same reason
there was only one supervisor what did
the supervisor
fairly quickly learn to do change the
rules
because we proved that following the
rules
couldn't possibly work all we did is
follow the rules
aggressively we aggressively complied
and it broke the whole system and
immediately forced a change
all right now the democrats have said
wokeness is important fairness is
important
and freedom of speech should be limited
if we can make an argument that it
incites
violence those are their rules
they're using them like a club to beat
the living and of republicans
what are republicans doing in response
ow
ow you're a hypocrite ow ow
stop hitting me you're a hypocrite ow
why isn't this working i keep saying
you're a hypocrite
but you keep hitting me ow ow
that's it that's the whole
strategy
is to get hit with a club and say stop
hitting me with a club
the whole strategy is to get hit
with a club
that's it here's a better strategy
adopt their techniques more aggressively
than they use their own techniques use
their own arguments
and never break character for example
they should republicans should close the
entire government down
don't let any work get done until they
handle the important things
wokeness fairness and making sure that
everyone who incited violence is
impeached
that's big work and they shouldn't do
anything else until they get that work
handled
so they should immediately do articles
of impeachment for every democrat
who supported black lives matter
harrison biden of course pelosi of
course
and this would be a much bigger task
than you could actually handle and still
do the business of government
so you should stop doing the business of
government
just let it go don't let any checks go
out
don't let any don't let any laws get
passed
don't do anything else except
try to get some fairness in the
democrats for example
does it seem fair to you that pelosi a
white woman
is the speaker i don't think so i think
that there should be a lot of
pressure on the democrats to get a
person of color
to replace nancy pelosi why
because i don't want to live in any
racist country where a racist
white person can be in charge of the
democratic party which isn't even
catering to white people
how is that right right
so instead of instead of arguing your
own side
let's say you're republican and saying
hey how about everybody has free
speech and hey how about we don't pick
ourselves to death over this wokeness
stuff
doesn't work you need to embrace it
harder than the other side until it
shuts down the whole government now
when you say scott isn't that a little
dangerous to shut down the whole
government
it's not as dangerous as the alternative
which is to
let one side dominate the other because
one side has a club
you know this wokeness and the
impeachments and the you're not fair and
you're all racist
and the other side doesn't have a weapon
they're not even looking for one
they don't have anything so if you want
that to persist
keep doing what you're doing if you want
it to end
you've got to impeach every one of the
democrats
who believe the or push the fine people
hoax
that would be a minimum anybody who said
that in public the fine people hoax that
was inciting violence
they got to be impeached and you should
close down if you're
republican you should close down the
whole government just say i'm not even
going to work on other stuff
if you think this is the important thing
if you think that stopping the
incitement of violence
is your top priority it's my top
priority too
and we're not going to go we're not
going to do a thing
until we get this handled and how about
the fairness
let's take a look at all those
republican
committees and appointments does that
look like america
well probably pretty well compared to
republicans but i don't think it's
nearly good enough
do they have enough lgbtq representation
i think we ought to look into that
because they ought to have a lot more
i think they ought to have a lot more
black people in their cabinet
i think they need a lot more
islamic folks in the cabinet and i don't
think we should
allow this not a bit we need more
fairness
we should call them racist for
everything in fact
we shouldn't even talk about it any
other way every single thing they do
should be called racist because this not
because it isn't
because it is what i'm suggesting is no
lying
no exaggeration just take their own
standard
and use it aggressively until it closes
the government because it would
and then see if they get flexible if
that doesn't make them flexible
that's the end of the country and that
would be okay with me
because living under the current
situation is untenable
meaning it can't last it will either
push people to violence
no actually that's all it will do it
would just push people to violence so
violence is pretty much
guaranteed in the current system so
if you tell me you know that
shutting down the government leads to
bad outcomes i say
yeah not as bad as the other way it's
the only way that you have
actually you know some chance that you
might be able to fix things
so if you don't see aggressive movement
toward impeaching every democrat who
pushed the fine people hoax
i would say republicans should not be
supported anymore
i'm not republican by the way um just
for full disclosure
uh i liked a lot of the things that i
thought trump could do
because i thought he could do some
things that other regular politicians
couldn't do
and sure enough he did uh the middle
east would be the best example of that
so um i feel that republicans have just
they've just basically surrendered
because if all they've got is argument
and all they've got
is hey stop hitting us with that club
they don't have anything and i don't see
any reason you should back them
whatsoever
if they're not willing to fight to get
rid of the
these weapons on the other side the like
the wokeness and the racism stuff and
the fake news and the
the fake impeachments the fake
incitement of violence and the
getting rid of free speech and the
banning you on social media
if they're not fighting against that
stuff
then everything's lost anyway so it
doesn't matter what else you do
so let's see if some republicans can get
a spine
and shut down the government because i
think we're at that point where they
just need to do that
just shut it all down because this this
impeachment
is so aggressively offensive to the
public
obviously some people like it but it's
aggressively offensive in the sense that
they're not even trying to do the job of
the people
because this wasn't it this was the job
of the politicians
all right they just wasted all of our
time doing something that had no benefit
except to what their own feelings
that's it um
scott you said they have to fight
where's the rest of your comment
yeah and you should you should also
approach the mba
uh now i think it would be a mistake
to go at it like oh white people are
being discriminated against
you still need to say that if you think
it's true but that's not
a strategy that's more the hypocrite
thing
it would be better to make them live up
to their own rules
and biden has to go because he's an old
white guy i mean
those are their rules it's not our rules
um all right
just looking at your comments
covered 19 vaccinations or m.i.a
i read something disturbing that i guess
israel has vaccinated 20 percent of
their population
i'm guessing that that 20 is in the
the people who have the most uh risk but
they're not yet seeing any reduction
in the coronavirus you know outcomes
so if you could get if you vaccinated 20
of your population and it happens to be
the 20
that matter the most the ones that need
the most protecting
um i always think that within the week
the statistics should start to reflect
that right
if we don't see that reflected really
soon i'm going to have some questions
i don't quite understand that
all right um
adults are so woke just looking at your
comments for a moment
all right that's all we got now yeah we
might have to wait a few weeks for to
know if the
vaccinations are already making a
difference
there's some reporting lag as well
all right that's all i got and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
see you tomorrow
