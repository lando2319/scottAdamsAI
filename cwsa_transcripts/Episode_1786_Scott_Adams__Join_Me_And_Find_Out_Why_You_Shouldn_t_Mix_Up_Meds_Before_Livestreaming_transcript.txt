good morning everybody
and welcome to
well i think i usually say the highlight
of civilization
but today
well anything could happen today you're
going to find out why in a minute
and before we
delve into that
let's jump right into
the simultaneous step and all you need
is a copper mug or glass tank or tails
to sign a canteen jerk a flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
go
now i need to start with a confession
because i don't know what you're going
to see
this morning i really don't
um and the confession is this
in order for you to understand this
you you have to have some background a
little context some of you don't have
this context so i'll just fill in the
gaps
there's a big difference between
somebody who's a chronic marijuana
smoker let's say somebody who has a
prescription for health reasons and
somebody who dabbles with it and does it
occasionally and the difference is
that one of them will get a real
you know
head high i guess you could call it
and the one who does it every day will
just say oh i had a good day today
but it won't be you know
weird i'm so high i can't do things kind
of high
so that's the first part of the context
the second part is that there are two
main
types
of marijuana
one is called sativa and that
can lift you up
and make you a little bit smarter and
more creative for a little while
especially for the first
hour or so and it can actually make you
better at what you're doing if you're
doing something that's creative right
don't try to operate happy equipment
necessarily
but the other kind is the opposite
and most people don't know this it's
basically you could almost think of them
as two
completely different
medications
the other is called the indica
and it would be best used by somebody
who
needs to chill out and somebody who
wants to go to bed just have a good
night's sleep
so one one lifts you up and makes your
brain work a
million miles a minute
uh for a little while
and another one just slows you down
well here's my confession
so i'm i have a prescription so i'm a
completely legal
medical marijuana user
and because i'm chronic
i can do what a let's say a weekend user
couldn't do
which is
i can smoke a ton of marijuana
right before i go on a live stream
and you wouldn't know the difference
if it's sativa
but
if you were to make the tragic mistake
of having a show that has to go on every
day at the same time no matter what
whether you're sick
or you've got covet
doesn't matter
nothing nothing will stop the show and
then on top of that
you mix up your
your your two lids
and uh
you mistakenly take the indica
when really what would have been the
right solution
would have been the sativa
now i don't know what it was going to
turn out this morning but i'm pretty
sure it's going to be less professional
than usual
that feels good
um
and right after i made this tragic
mistake i have this recollection of
tweeting
and i want to see if i tweeted anything
embarrassing
but did i tweet anything embarrassing in
the last few minutes
let's say
checking my
twitter feed
so i tweeted that the show that's good
and below that
or here's a tweet um i guess i sent this
18 minutes ago glass half full
the supreme court decision on roe vs
wade is a huge victory for oral sex
okay
well let's
just continue with the show
um
first item
now i tweeted this the other day and i
think it's an awesome idea
and
it's based on the fact have you heard of
these adus
it stands for uh
what's it called additional dwelling
unit or something
but it's it's the laws have changed so
that you can make a little bit of a
tiny little house or a tiny little
office in your backyard
and accessory
accessory dwelling unit so you can put a
little
extra house in your backyard but it's
tiny and there are a number of companies
that make them
and i had the following thought
because
a number of people throughout my life
have said some version of this
i'd love to start my own business
doing some kind of personal service
doing nails or doing hair or massage or
acupuncture or something like that
and always the problem is where to do it
because rents would be high
or
you know there's just always a problem
with where to do it
and i thought to myself why couldn't you
make these adus
some of them
specialty made for
a certain profession
so for example you'd have one
that
would be just for people who want to do
nails they could just put it in their
backyard and they're in business
and nobody has to go in the house
and i thought to myself that's going to
happen right
because
well let me ask you in the comments let
me ask you in the comments i'll bet
there's somebody here just watching this
right now
who knows somebody or is somebody
who would be able to immediately start a
business if you only had like a cheap
little
nice little office or
service area how how many
yeah and now let's let's assume that the
zoning laws are going to allow it
look you're you're already saying yeses
go by so i think the
the market
yeah a bunch of people are saying yes
actually more than i thought
i figured there would be a smattering
but there are quite a few people saying
yes
yeah because it seems like everybody
knows someone
who needs an office
and in many cases that's uh you know
getting the capital to
or even you know the credit i guess to
rent a space
it's kind of hard if you don't already
have an income or you're not already in
the business
so
couldn't you do pop-up businesses
and if you think about it there really
are a ton of businesses
that people could do immediately
if they just had a little space
and i guess would have to be a zoning
law change as well
meth lab
somebody's suggesting a meth lab i love
my audience
all right
here's a thought that i was smart enough
not to tweet
because it requires a little bit of
conversation so you know i'm not
completely serious but maybe i am but
sort of
but maybe it's
the bad idea that makes you think of the
good idea
how about that
so don't think that this is 100 serious
maybe it just makes you think of a
better idea
so the conversation going on now is
about whether the
you know the supreme court is legitimate
and whether this decision is
democratic you know and whether it
whether it makes sense to have
judges
make decisions on things that maybe the
majority should be making instead
those are good questions
but i would like to toss this thought
into the
mix i suppose you said
or suppose the supreme court had an
internal rule
that if there was a decision that was
primarily about one
let's say gender's body
that only the only the supreme justices
of that gender would make the decision
now the first thing you're going to say
is wait that would change some decisions
well maybe you would
in the short run but it would also tell
you you better nominate some women
right
now
you wouldn't get the decision you wanted
probably on
on abortion
so it doesn't work in terms of getting
you what you want right away but if you
were if you were going to fix
i'm seeing people i'm seeing a woman
commenting on locals
that she's a woman and women are the
worst
so you can't let them do that
no i i think for credibility
all right so here's the modified version
of that it seems that people don't like
that idea
right so you don't like that idea that's
okay let's back off that we're just
we're brainstorming so we just back off
that one
how about this
if it's a decision about a woman's body
you let the decision both the majority
and the minority opinion be written by
women
and vice versa if it's something that
only is only about a man's body let's
say because it might be something about
that
how about that
so even if
j just has to come from a woman
no
somebody says shut up stoner boy
yeah maybe we'll go to the next issue
yeah i think anything that would change
anything that would risk
this audience thinking that they would
get a different result would be
you know it would look bad for you i
guess
and what is a woman you ask okay
did you see the kabbalah
harris uh tweet and the photo of her
standing next to a tv on the private
plane
so there's this horrible photo
i think maybe i have to show it if i can
find it quickly
oh yeah i can
look at that so if you can see this
so there she is
and she's on a private plane and she's
looking you know
all serious because she's looking at the
uh
the roe vs wade decision protesters
and
what she says is
in the tweet
i know there are women out there who are
afraid
to those of you who feel alone and
scared i want you to know the president
and i are fighting for you and your
rights
so here they are fighting
fighting away
kamala is fighting and the way she's
fighting is by riding a private jet and
watching tv
so look her in the fight there
now my favorite part of this is that can
you see
can you see that there's a some kind of
an aide who's running out of the door
and
some of the the bad rap that kamal
harris gets is that she doesn't hire
good and smart people
but i think this proves that she hired
at least one
because it was somebody who knew not to
be in this picture
as soon as the camera came out you could
see this aid saying yeah scurry scurry
so the aid is like don't get me in this
picture
but nobody stopped to tell kamala
that uh first of all she looked like uh
uh who is the
she
so nobody told her that the henny
youngman pose is not your best look
is anybody old enough to remember hedy
youngman
or is that ed sullivan
don't do the ed sullivan
sure so
we've got a very big act there they're
coming in out of england they're called
the beatles
don't do the ed sullivan
somebody should remind her
second thing
and this is possible
um
i'm gonna do a close-up on the
the assistant running out of the room
so it's a female assistant that's all we
know we don't know who it is but it's
possible that the assistant is a
terrorist
and the reason i say that
is that there's somebody who does calmly
hair
and as she's running out of the room
look at look at cobbler's hair
so is it possible that this was her
hairdresser
who had committed this
obviously a domestic
terrorist act on her hair
was she running away
so that she didn't get caught on camera
and
so that's what i see i mean
i see ed sullivan
the
victim of a terrible domestic hairstyle
attack
possibly
all right
so the news is that uh gelane maxwell
has been placed on suicide watch
just days before her sentencing hearing
but her attorney says that she's not
actually suicidal
which sounds a lot
like a monte pipe monty python skit am i
wrong
does that
does it sound like a monty python skit
here let me let me do this in monte
python talk
uh this this would be the warden talking
to galen you know so the warden's
outside the cell and he says uh miss
maxwell
we've decided to place you
on a suicide watch
and galen says
suicide watch
i'm not suicidal
yes you are yeah you you're looking a
little down lately
no i'm not
i'm feeling perfectly fine
i don't think so we've noticed you a
little restless pretty sure you're
desperately sad and suicidal
i'm really not in fact i've been digging
a tunnel look under the bed i'm halfway
done
i've got two three days left i'll be out
of here i'm feeling great i've never
felt better
no
i think you're just on the edge of
hanging yourself or possibly beating
yourself to death with a heavy object
i actually feel fine and i'm going to
escape why would i beat myself to death
with a heavy object
that's the kind of bad thinking that
makes us think you're suicidal
or something
but i'd call that foreshadowing
foreshadowing
[Applause]
um
do you believe in the slippery slope yes
or no
is the slippery slope real or as i've
been telling you forever it's the worst
way to think about things
now my opinion
is that the slippery slope
is subjective
and therefore useless for decision
making
because
if there's something you don't want to
happen
you say it's a slippery slope
but if it's something you do want to
happen what do you call it
progress
progress
so your slippery slope might be my
progress and vice versa
so it's such a subjective standard that
i say don't use a slippery slope but if
you do use it i wonder if you're using
it in this example
so their
protesters are saying this
supreme court ruling on roe versus wade
is a slippery slope and the next thing
you know
you'll see bans on same-sex marriages
you'll see contraceptive bands and you'd
see
criminalized homosexuality
now
if you believe in the slippery slope
do you believe these are next
most of you are slippery slopers
what do the slopers say
is that a word
what do you what do you think
is uh
is this decision
the first step and what will surely be
the criminalization of same-sex
marriages and maybe homosexuality itself
well let me tell you something that the
left doesn't understand about the right
here's something the left doesn't
understand about the right
i don't know the last time if ever
i've talked to a republican
who was very concerned about
what you put in your various holes
you know who put what and whose body
hole
as long as you don't do it on their lawn
they really really don't care
and i would say even uh gay marriage
which at one point was you know a
sensitive thing is there any republican
now who's saying oh
that gay marriage ruined everything
are they
i don't know i've never met one
i don't think i've see i've never even
heard a republican even talk about it
it's not even a topic
when was the last time
when was the last time you heard
like a republican
know complaining about or even caring in
any way about somebody's sexual
preference it's just not even a thing
so to imagine that the slippery slope
would go to there would be
i don't know
you have to have a good imagination to
get to that point same with
contraceptive bans and
um i i just can't see any of that
happening
can you
i mean legitimately can you see any of
that happening
no
well
believe it or not max boot had a
fascinating
tweet thread
with some context
but i'm going to put some context on his
context
i'm going to i'm going to high-ground
his contacts like hell
so we're gonna start out showing that
max boot is making a good analysis it
actually is pretty good
and it goes like this
max boot tweet thread
and the point of it is he's saying that
the
supreme court is illegitimate
um
as it's formed and here's his argument
he says bush versus gore
elevated george w bush to the presidency
after you lost the popular vote
all right and the that in turn led to
the appointments of roberts and lito
so the first thing is that a person who
was not elected by the majority of
voters
put two conservatives on the court
next when scalia died republicans and
senate denied even hearing from the
obama nominee in a historic break from
norms and that allowed a president trump
who lost the popular vote so here's the
theme
to make three appointments
so in both cases now we've got five five
appointments
by presidents who are not elected by the
popular vote
yeah yeah yeah we know it's a
that's not how our system works we'll
get to that
and then max boot says it cannot be
repeated enough this extremist uh scotus
majority was created by presidents who
lost the popular mandate
one of the one of whom won the
presidency in part
uh through the activism of the
supreme court right wing in bush for a
score
another who got to a point an obama
vacancy
and then max says this is an extreme
version of the minority governing the
majority
that has been the gop playbook for some
time now
and these unelected right-wing judges
could be on the court in in like 2060
thanks to lifetime appointments
he says this is totally unsustainable
it's not just an election cycle issue
it's a functioning democracy issue
and then he says that the court has to
be reformed but he doesn't he's not
specific about how to do that
now
that's kind of an interesting context
isn't it
because
really a lot of things had to happen
coincidentally to be where we are
am i right
i mean these were really close elections
you had to have a
system that would allow
a person who lost the popular vote to
win anyway we had that
but
didn't we reduce our government to
chance
is that what we did
because i feel like that's what we did
we took this really good idea you know
the constitution and
and
it had a lot of merit
but somewhere along the line it probably
had to do with the news you know
dividing us
somewhere along the line everything uh
went to hell
and now we're actually a point where
when we observe
why roe versus wade was overturned
the only reason that makes sense to me
is it was just chance
it was just chance
because it was chance they got us you
know trump at the exact year that the um
there was there were justices up for
uh nomination it was kind of chance
i mean who saw it coming that mitch
mcconnell could hold open you know could
break precedence and get away with it it
was kind of chance
and even
and even as max boo correctly says
if it was because the court was already
had some leaning people on it that's the
only reason
things went the way they went from now
i feel like we took this great system
and because we're just all
as humans we divide divided into two
teams
and then we ruined the whole point of
the supreme court
by nominating people whose votes we
already knew in advance
we're just basically
we took this great system and we broke
it and the only way you could possibly
break it by knowing in advance how
everybody's going to vote before you put
them on the supreme court
which defeats the whole purpose
you could actually just get rid of the
supreme court
because they've made themselves obsolete
by always voting the way you think
they're going to vote i mean
not every time i'll give you that but it
feels like it on the big stuff
i mean
you know big surprise roe versus wade
went this way because the judges went
that way
so
we should not be proud of the fact that
we figured out how to take the greatest
system ever devised and because we're
basically all
we found the only way to break it by
guaranteeing that we never put together
a credible supreme court and that they
would always just vote with their
political bias and then they would paper
it over with some rationale over the
fact after the fact because that's what
you got
that's what you got
now i blame the
you know the news business mostly
for dividing us but we let it happen
like we watch it right in front of us
and we still let it happen
right we couldn't agree with each other
it's an option
like we could work things out it's
happened before
you know we were more reasonable before
but for some reason we all
we all took the lead from the news and
decided that being completely
unreasonable is the only way to go
because that's how you win
but yeah maybe it maybe it is maybe
that's maybe that's why the right one
because they they fought it like it was
a genuine war
well watching bill maher turn into a
republican is my favorite hobby now
and
this most recent his friday show
i didn't see it all but i saw the
relevant clips
and
it's just a classic
and i'm going to try to summarize his
argument he's saying that
basically what's wrong with the
democrats
as a as a party that can get enough
people to vote for them
uh what they're doing wrong
is that they're not
supporting
their own base they're not acting like
lawyers
for their base
so this is how bill maher said it
what you want is a lawyer
like uh johnny depat
if you have a good lawyer you get good
results
and he said
the democrats are not acting like good
lawyers for their clients which are the
democrats
what does that sound like
he's not he's not treating
so they're not acting like a lawyer who
would treat their own client as their
number one priority
what's that sound like
it sounds like america first
literally
it's like
somehow somehow he got all the way back
to america first but had to go through
like a lawyer thing
to get there
and
i'm just amazed
and bill moore also said this here's
some quotes
he said trump could win 2024 so easy
if you just let go of 2020 now
probably every republican agrees with
that right
if you just don't make it easy for the
other side to call you an
insurrectionist
just don't make it easy it's like the
only thing that can go wrong
just don't make it easy
and mars says that trump is the only guy
who can lose to biden
which i think is true
and points to desantis as a strong
candidate right bill maher is saying
desantis is drunk he doesn't agree with
him he says he's way too conservative
but he says not nuts
so this is bill maher saying
that uh
that desantis is way too conservative
but not nuts
he is this close to voting for him
and
and the way to conservative part
is probably stuff that the supreme court
handles anyway but you know i guess
you'd get more more judges like that if
you have more republican presidents
so
um that's it's just fascinating watch
that happen
uh the national review is writing that
uh just because trump got lucky you
basically and it was in the right time
uh it doesn't mean it gets credit
so they're trying to remove credit from
trump
for essentially
you know being the main reason
that the court is uh conservative and
therefore roe versus wade got overturned
now
can we say at this point that he is the
most consequential
president
i mean he's right up there
now that was always my prediction as he
would be one of the most consequential
presidents
now and then the jokester say oh he was
consequential in a bad way
but i feel like
i feel like at this point
whether you like it or not
he said i will deliver a set of things
to republicans he came pretty close
i mean
you know everybody complains about
the border
but
you know i in my opinion he tried pretty
hard
it was just hard
and you know the things i wish he had
done more about like healthcare
but he didn't promise much on that so
maybe maybe he did maybe he did over
promise on that actually
so cnn found a way
well let's just tell the story you'll
see
so if you saw anna navarro she was
passionately
arguing
in favor of abortion rights
and
part of her explanation about the
importance of them is that not every
family
uh has the you know the mental health
and the resources
to handle a special needs child
now
what do you hear when you hear that
do you hear that the way i hear it
and the way other the way other people
heard it
now i guess
i'm going to try to be consistent and
say hey 48 hours to clarify
but i feel like she said directly
exactly what she was thinking
that
if you knew
somehow early on that your
your potential child was going to have
some special needs
that some people in some situations
would be better off having the option of
terminating
now
there are plenty of people who have that
opinion but i'm wondering if she
actually meant to say it
what do you think
do you think she meant to say that out
loud on tv
i feel like we need to give her a day
because she might want to modify that
and you know i've been
a big critic of her in the past but i
can't i can't release on my standard
just yet
i feel like give her two days
see what happens yeah i mean maybe
yeah then somebody
i saw it was a brendan strzok or
something said that she was saying the
quiet part out loud
you know that's an overused
um
saying
but i felt like it fit this time
it's uh
it was kind of shocking and even that
essie cup who works also for cnn
who apparently has a
autistic kid she says
and uh you know disagrees with anna
navarro's characterization so essie cobb
took it the same way i took it and she
works on the same network
so
but still
but still give her a day she might want
to modify that never know
but maybe she doesn't
you know i i would respect her
i would respect her if she said yes
that's exactly what i meant
like you know you could agree or
disagree with it but then you could at
least
respect that she said what she meant
and directly but i think she did
i mean i actually think she said what
she meant it looks like it oh we'll let
her see
all right there's a huge spike in google
searches for how to move to canada
have you
of course because canada has a
very liberal
abortion laws i guess you can get
abortion for practically any reason
that's probably an exaggeration but
they're very
very
let's say very flexible in canada
and
i wonder how could that ever make sense
economically could it ever make sense to
move to canada
versus to fly to california to get an
abortion
i mean just the economics of it don't
make sense it was like
like
is that how you're going to make your
stand
by doing the least economical thing you
could do
all right
but i think canada is always our
universal escape hatch mentally
every time something bad happens
it's like the vietnam draft
i'm going to canada
if trump's elected i'm going to canada
roe vs wade gets
dropped go into canada
i wonder if canada has anything to say
about this
i wonder if canada watches our politics
and they say we don't do that
oh no
no no or
i can't do a canadian accent but it'd be
like no no
don't do that
don't make that ruling supreme court
is that that's that's a terrible accent
isn't it
uh because they don't want people to
like storm into canada see that would
that would be the point of that
um
cnn had some uh
fakeish news
you know i'm watching them now to see if
they're serious about their turn toward
the center and maybe they are maybe they
are
but
the way i would have uh the phrase the
story was
a bunch of protesters surrounded a truck
on all sides
and they were beaten on the truck and
trying to prevent it from doing
something
and the truck
you know kept going forward somewhat
low speed you know just to try to shake
them off
and maybe some of them got hurt
attacking the truck
so to me this is a story about
protesters attack truck and get her in
the process
cnn says truck hit
truck hits abortion rights protesters
which
i guess from a physics standpoint the
truck did hit the protesters
so from a strictly you know
physical perspective yes
but wouldn't it be
more appropriate to talk about the
intentions of all people involved
the intention of the truck
driver was to live
the intention of the
protesters was to do something bad to
the person or the truck
i mean i feel like the story should be
more about the intention of the people
involved a little bit less
about
the vehicle
i recently had a situation where i had
to move a person away from my car
so i'm a little sensitive to this
and uh i just moved him with my car
so
it turns out
that if you press a car into a person
they get out of the way
and i actually had to
i had to do this the other day don't ask
why
some people get mad about some things
it wasn't anybody i knew by the way
um
here's a probable fake news alert
probable fake news alert probable fake
news alert
meaning
meaning
that uh here's something that's on the
internet but not on regular news
when you see something that everybody is
passing around on the internet but not a
single regular news big outlet wants to
touch it
is it real
because at least you could get you know
the people on the left
or the people on the right to like it
even if it's not real usually
no it wasn't any it wasn't i said it
wasn't anybody i know it was literally
literally somebody i'd never seen before
all right
um
i was just in the wrong place at the
wrong time that's all you need to know
so
what do you think about this story that
there's a massive drop in babies being
born in germany
after the pandemic started
which was around
the time of vaccinations
now i don't believe
that we have scientific
evidence
that vaccinations changed
pregnancies
in terms of something that you see in
terms of the entire
rate of birth
i'm not saying that there are not
individual cases
because i'm sure that you always have
those
probably with every vaccination
but
in terms of larger statistical you can
really see the top line a gigantic drop
in births
now this is going around the internet
do you think that's true
do you think it's true
that there's been a gigantic drop in
births in germany since
around the time of the vaccinations
which doesn't mean the vaccinations are
the cause by the way so even the people
who are passing around
are not saying it's definitely the cause
they're saying uh what's going on here
and shouldn't we be looking at this
well i don't think it's real
what do you think
i know i would i would keep an open mind
on that one but i'm i'm guessing that's
not real
um i believe that the uh country is
suffering from what i'll call ukraine
fatigue
are we done with ukraine
because the news is treating it like the
permanent news now it's like and some
missiles landed in kiev
so and let's talk about something else
wait that's the capital
i thought they were done with the
capital
well
looks like putin is doing exactly
what you would do if you were putin
he consolidated the
uh important strategic parts of ukraine
and now he's grinding down the ukraine
military that had to be there
so he had concentrated the ukraine
military he's grinding it into dust and
then he'll take the rest of ukraine
does that look like what's happening
and it doesn't look like he's going to
be crippled by the economic stuff
but there is a there is a rush against
time
in my opinion
the sanctions on russia
when it starts to affect their spare
parts
will be crippling
but it won't be crippling
uh for a while because they can always
move things around and make new and
you know things but in the long run i
think if if the sanctions stay on russia
all of their important industries will
fall apart because they just want parts
unless china jumps in fast enough i
guess that's always a possibility
but
it depends on which parts yeah
so
i feel as if there's a race against uh
time
so that the russians need to you know
finish with ukraine as soon as possible
so that they can act like good players
and try to get the sanctions dropped
eventually or at least sooner than later
and
we're hoping that the sanctions slow him
down i guess
now here's what it seems to me
we could say was
the biden administration strategy
because i think they said it down loud
didn't they
do me a fact check on this
because i may be almost right but not
right on this
it seems to me
that at this point it looks like the
biden administration sacrificed ukraine
to
damage
russia
and to degrade them militarily and
economically and if we could degrade
them militarily and economically
then if as long as there wasn't a
nuclear war we would come out way ahead
because we'll be
basically competing with them all over
the world
and so we want them to be as suppressed
as possible
and that
we never we never meant to help ukraine
although if ukraine had just won the war
outright we would have been happy
but i think from the united states
perspective we had two ways to win
and this is not my definition of winning
because i don't think there's any
winning going on here
um but one way to win is ukraine just
pushes russia back
and just wins flat out
now i don't think there was much a
chance that they would win like all of
it flat out
but
that would be one way the other way is
to lose
but lose slowly
and lose in a in a way that there's like
a permanent resistance
because i think russia's military will
just be bogged down
for a long time with this like permanent
resistance every time they send some
heavy equipment in
will
some american bill equipment will be
fired by ukrainian and destroy the
russian heavy equipment
so i think we found
we basically created a
a sinkhole
that putin will be just driving his
military into it for years
so are we trying to take down the soviet
union by
bleeding them to get to death in
afghanistan
is it is it basically the same
strategy is to get them involved in a
war they can't win but don't put our own
soldiers in there
that's what it is right
did
not somebody says you were wrong again
um
wrong now or wrong before
i'm pretty willing to say that i'm wrong
on ukraine stuff i i don't have any
special skill with military
you know predictions
russia is slowly using artillery to
destroy said sinkhole yeah it's a race
against time
but the thing is that
no matter how much russia destroys
ukraine
it's a big enough place that there will
always be resistance right
so as long as there's an active
well-funded well-armed well-trained
resistance it's just going to be really
expensive for russia in a long time so
it looks like we're trying to spend
russia
and not go bankrupt before they do but i
don't think that part worked
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the worst live stream in the
history of live streams
or possibly the best i don't know
could be the best
uh you be the judge
uh one of the best okay
all right
scott looks like he's about to cry over
roe vs wade
do you think you know my opinion
the the thing i say the most is that
as long as i'm not a
chest feeding birthing person
i'm not going to give you my opinion
if i were a woman you'd hear my opinion
about abortion i wouldn't shut up about
it
but i'm not
so
i'd rather take myself out of that fight
and talk about it
all right
please discuss covid survival
strategies that old topic
comments about where elon is oh there's
an interesting question
did elon musk sort of stop tweeting for
a little while
maybe maybe they're just trying to
complete the
twitter deal or something i don't know
or he's on summer vacation
oh a heart
um
he hasn't tweeted in four days somebody
said interested
have you ever been involved in an
abortion
that's a personal question
now
let's say in involved the the only way i
know i've involved been involved is i
once accompanied somebody
like if
if ever something of mine was aborted
i'm not aware of it but
but i once accompanied somebody
um
you were not notified
you know elon musk was working on
escaping earth
in his rocket
all right i think we've done everything
we need to do today and so this
concludes
the youtube portion of coffee with scott
adams the best show you've ever seen in
your life
bye for now
