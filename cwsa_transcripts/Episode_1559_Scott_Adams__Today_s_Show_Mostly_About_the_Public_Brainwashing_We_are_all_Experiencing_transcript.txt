good morning ladies and gentlemen and
everything in between
which we value equally
this
is the best thing that could have ever
happened to you
yeah it's called coffee with scott adams
and how lucky that you either stumbled
in here by luck congratulations to you
or you're so smart that you know you
know you should come here every day
either way it's a great great way to
start the day
and if you'd like to take it up another
notch yeah it's possible i know i know
it doesn't seem like it could get any
better right but watch this
it's called the simultaneous sip
and no matter how good your day has
started it takes it up another level i
know you won't believe it until you try
it yourself but let's try it all you
need is a copper mug or glass attacker
challenge design a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine here of the day the thing
that makes everything better
including your antibodies don't believe
me watch this go
can you feel your antibodies
bristling
they're bristling with power now
the only way you can tell is you feel a
little bit extra friction
is from the bristles that's science
well um as marty balartefest
pointed out in a tweet today
that elon musk was very clever
to do a twitter poll asking people if he
should sell a bunch of his tesla stock
why was that clever anybody anybody
i'll tell you
why it was clever
it was clever because he warned the
public ahead of time and framed it
he framed it as a
as a citizen trying to pay taxes
how much better could you do
you couldn't do any better than that
because if he had simply just sold it
and i think he had to maybe to pay off
some
uh
obligations from some other tax thing
and
imagine if he just sold it and didn't
tell anybody
that the stock would dive it would look
like he's lost faith and of course that
would be ridiculous
because it's only 5 billion which is not
much for him
but it wouldn't look bad
but because he he did this little
twitter
poll he made it made us think that the
issue was paying taxes
and we all kind of went along with that
it was kind of genius
and he's very if you watch uh musk he's
very consistent
in
in uh understanding the room you know
able to uh work the room and and work
your impressions of the room you know
tesla famously doesn't do
advertising
they don't do
advertising now do me a fact check on
that i think that's true right they
don't do advertising instead they just
make good products that
people want to talk about
and then elon musk does things that
people want to talk about
every time elon musk does something you
think is a little crazy and provocative
and maybe he shouldn't have done it
if you're not simultaneously thinking to
yourself
oh they don't do regular marketing
they they draw your attention in
non-traditional ways once you realize
that it's a little more transparent what
he's up to
um
have i told you that i was expecting a
hit piece on me
because it's the political season
starting to heat up again as we get to
2022.
so how many how many thought my
prediction would be good that there
would be a hit piece on me
well yesterday on twitter a journalist
for sf gate
so this would be
a local left-leaning publication
asked if i would
like to
be the subject of a
profile a profile
do you know what i do you know what it
means when a journalist asks
somebody who talks about politics
if they can do a profile on them
well
i'm i'm sad to say that i used to be
dumb enough to fall for this and and did
and when i say used to
i'm not talking about when i was in my
20s and that you know i didn't have much
experience i'm talking about i fell for
this trick
five years ago four years ago
i fell for this with bloomberg so
bloomberg had a journalist was hey we
want to do a big feature piece profile
on you and i thought to myself
wow
you know bloomberg's pretty big
publication
and they want to do a feature piece on
me this will be great i can mention my
website and
sell some books
i know this couldn't be better
that wasn't two years ago no that was
like
2017 maybe
somebody do a fact check on that the
bloomberg article on me 2017 i think
no no
was it before the election
2016 maybe
anyway
the point is that
bloomberg clearly was playing on the
democrat team
clearly sending somebody to take me out
did not count on me retweeting it
because i'm a little bit
anti-fragile
meaning that the more you attack me the
stronger i get
and i don't think they quite
counted on that
and so indeed my profile went up instead
of down
but they took a run at it they took a
pretty good run at it and if you were to
google my name
the the fake news uh
industry would would put their article
at the top
so if you do a search for me now i don't
know if it's still the case but if you
did it on on google
and you and you did it um oh march 2017
is when the bloomberg article was but if
you did search on that today i don't
know if it'd still be there but during
the election it was the top result
so if anybody saw something i said and
said i better check out this guy
see if i should listen to more of what
he says or not they would have seen that
top result it was just a hit piece i'm
just a ridiculous hit piece
so
when the sf gate asked if they could do
a profile piece on me
i of course said
thank you but no thank you
so
they're common coming
they're coming now this won't be the
last one
and i would expect that at least
somebody will write a piece without my
involvement
it's far more credible if you can get
the
uh the topic of your hit piece to be
part of it
which is what i used to fall for oh i
think this will be good i'll just i'll
just say good things and then that's all
they could write about
nope
they could just make up anything they
want
and they do
all right um
here's more on my theme that democrats
uniquely don't understand human
motivation
every time i give you one of these
examples
put it in the bin in your brain with the
other examples
of democrats not understanding human
motivation
it's the problem with all of their stuff
all of their policies have the same
whole
the humans don't act the way they hope
they do
conservatives typically get the human
part right consistently consistently
now it might look like the the
conservatives are being more cruel
because they can be more harsh in their
their world view
but it's because it works
there's no other reason
the only reason is because it works and
the other things don't work
i'm almost positive if you could if you
could find out that let's say socialism
worked
you know i don't think you could prove
that but let's say pure socialism not
not the little bit like the europeans do
but if you could prove that pure
socialism actually worked
i think you could convince conservatives
too it's just that it can't be proved
because it doesn't and it violates
everything you know about human behavior
but here's here's the new example and
greg gotfield
tweeted this about cnn's coverage
so uh
the uh the subject was the written house
uh trial kyle rittenhouse on trial for
self-defense uh that they call murder
and the chiron on cnn and don lemon was
on there with two other people the
chiron said conservatives embrace kama
celebrate white vigilantism
what
is it is that the the most on
let's say unaware uh
interpretation of
of conservatives
let me just give you a thought
experiment
just a thought experiment
imagine that kyle rittenhouse had been
black
and then
imagined that exactly everything else
was exactly the same
and that the people he shot were three
white people just like kylo ren house
um
how would conservatives
see this
this do you think the conservatives
would say oh wait a minute
i didn't realize that the shooter was
black
and now self-defense doesn't matter and
i don't like the second amendment
anymore
are you kidding me
are you kidding me
see if i'm wrong
i believe a hundred percent a hundred
percent not even 99.
i believe 100 of conservatives would say
under the same facts right that the
facts have to be identical i think a
hundred percent of conservatives would
say
yeah that's still self-defense
that's still self-defense
i'm looking at your comments so you're
all agreeing with me right so anybody
who has even a little bit of
understanding of the conservative
philosophy
there's no question about this one and
to imagine
as cnn does to imagine in their usual
you know mind-reading way to imagine
that conservatives are seeing this to be
about race
this is so not about race
let me ask you something if a
conservative sees an issue it involves a
gun
and it also involves race
which one which one's bigger in their
mind
yeah there's a racial component maybe
it's not that important to the story but
there's a racial component and then
there's a gun and they're both important
to the story
the conservatives care about the gun
the gun
right
the constitution
this is easy stuff but the the left i
don't know if they don't know it or they
pretend they don't know it it's always
hard to tell
all right uh so as greg gupfield pointed
out the cnn is uh
that has for months if not years
cheered on the uh
the violent protests the antifa the blm
and in direct language chris cuomo said
directly
that you know who said our riots have to
be peaceful
essentially supporting the fact that
some forms of protest
are going to get a little uh violent
and then when the most obvious thing
happens which is you you rail against
the police forever and you defund the
police and you say yeah it's fine to
have these peaceful protests that are
actually
violent
how did you not think
a vigilante would appear
before kyle
did i not tell you that vigilantes would
appear
now i don't think he was a vigilante so
that so first of all
don't buy their frame because he wasn't
a vigilante or anything like it
but i did tell you the vigilantes were
guaranteed
and i don't think kyle is one of them
but he's getting thrown into that that
group
so it should have been predictable
that somebody would uh you know you
could call him a vigilante but i would
call him
just a patriot who maybe made a decision
that shouldn't have been made
but certainly his intention was in the
right place it looks like it to me
so uh democrats you got you got what you
asked for a world without police but you
got to take it all you don't get just
the good parts
you don't get the part where there's not
you know fewer police shootings without
the part where there's more crime
at least if defunding the police is your
only technique
all right uh
i have a rule that you should never be
taken seriously if you have a porn
mustache
can we all agree on this
if if you've got like a goatee or a
beard maybe
you know i'll take you seriously if
you've got a full full goatee or a beard
um
but can we take people seriously who
just have a mustache like a like a big
big old mustache
i would say now
and is it my imagination or is
kyle rittenhouse being prosecuted by
gary oldman in batman
am i wrong
right the prosecutor that's just gary
oldman in the batman movies right
i think you're bright
but there's new mustache news
i said the same thing about uh
oh i can't remember his name never mind
but uh biden is nominating a new head
for the fda
uh the presumably corrupt
group in government i say presumably
corrupt
based on what we've observed in the last
year
i can't prove it so i don't have data
but um
the the smart assumption is that the fda
is corrupt
uh and that money's behind it
and i say that because the experience
with the rapid testing you know the slow
approval of that if you look into that
you'll see
there is no explanation for it
which means there's one explanation for
it
now i'd love to be wrong and i'd love to
find out that all the members of the fda
are great patriots and doing the best
they can and there's no monetary
anything
but i doubt it so anyway the guy who's
being nominated dr rob khalif he's got a
big old porn mustache
he's being put in charge
of the
you know maybe the entity be besides the
supreme court that we should take most
seriously
right this is one of the most serious
jobs you could ever have have it head to
the fda
and we put porn mustache guy there
now
porn mustache guy we only know one thing
about him well two we know his name the
second thing we know about him is the
one thing we know he decided on he got
wrong
i wonder if i should have a big old
mustache
if the if you're wearing a big
error and judgment right on your face
how are we supposed to take the rest of
it seriously
now i've said that uh trump had the same
problem with his unusual haircut boris
johnson too
although i've come to think that uh a
an unusual haircut might actually be an
advantage because people can't look away
but the mustache is different
the mustache is
too normal
right you having having wild hair is is
far less normal
so
i don't think you put the mustache guy
in charge of the fda that's all i'm
saying and by the way this is speaking
in terms of persuasion
you know i'm sure he's very qualified
but persuasion-wise it's a bad look
let's talk about kyle rittenhouse and
what's happening are you all aware of
what the fake news industry the fni is
doing right now
so the fake news industry i include
i can reach over here
hold on
audio problem
so the fni or fake news industry that i
i include the social media networks
and part of that
this is the play they're running on the
country right now
which is
there are several narratives that can
come out of the written house trial
one of them is white supremacy
even though
there's no white supremacy anywhere in
the story
there's no white supremacy
anywhere in the story there's nobody who
was juan nobody did anything racial it
was something that white people did to
each other
no trace of white supremacy
but
the narrative is that the country is
full of white supremacy
so kyle is being tied to this the briden
even called him a white supremacist
which he should be sued for if not
lose his job biden that is he should
lose his job for that
he should be kicked out of the
presidency for
for attacking a citizen
and not not even correcting it
i suppose if he corrected it if biden
did i'd be willing to say uh that was
just a terrible mistake
but you don't want to lose a president
over it
not correcting it
not correcting
that biden called this young man a white
supremacist with no
no evidence whatsoever that that was the
case
you need to be fired for that if you're
the president
that should be the end of it you they
should just walk you out of the office
you should put your in a box
and get out of the office
because you are embarrassing the country
at that point you're so far from the
the uh let's say the culture of the
united states and what is right and what
every single person thinks is right you
need to go
all right and being mentally incompetent
that's not good enough
you need to be out of that job right
away
here's something that trump never did
attack voters
he never did that
right he attacked people who attacked
him that's that's different but he
didn't go after like an individual in
the news and call him a
something like a white supremacist i
mean that's so far over the line
that that should be
immediate lose your job anyway the other
narrative is that uh white men are bad
of course so there'll be more of that
he's a white man look at all these white
men doing bad things
the other narrative is about guns
gun control you know hey if you have
guns people are going to get killed blah
blah and then there's the unequal
justice one which will pretend that this
case is like other cases where there's a
black defendant
is this case anything
like any of those other cases
it's so
so com yeah we're
saying it in the comments on locals
these cases are all unique
there are no two two of these cases that
should be compared
and the moment you you make an analogy
of these cases you've abandoned all
all rational
disorders because they're just different
things there's nothing in common with
them
so
here's the play
the cnns and the fake news industry of
the world will push these narratives
which will cause riots and conflict and
lots of things to talk about
that will get them lots of clicks and
they will make more money and it will
increase their political power
now
you can see this right
you all see this forming
because now that we've seen the cycle
enough times you can see it early
i i feel like there was a time
we wouldn't have noticed this right
there was a time you wouldn't have
really known this was going on but now
it's all transparent i don't think they
try to hide it anymore because it's
clear that they don't need to
they can just do it right in front of
you
there's no
there's no penalty
all right so let me talk some more about
uh kyle rittenhouse how many of you who
watched it think he was fake crying
this will be an interesting question i'm
very interested in your answer to this
how many of you think he was
fake crying
i'm saying all knows on locals and on
youtube
i'm seeing uh nobody thinks it was fake
50 50.
somebody says ptsd
well i saw lebron james uh mock kyle
rittenhouse because he thought it was
fake crying obviously he said there's no
tears
now if i told you there were no tears i
don't know if you noticed but i looked
at it again i didn't see any
if there were no tears
was it real
well i don't i mean we can't read his
mind but let me give you uh
lebron knows how to cry yeah
uh let me give you my take on this
i put myself in his position
suppose you were kyle rittenhouse how
would you feel
about the fact that you took two lives
and you were being blamed as a murderer
and a white supremacist in public
how would you feel about that
you'd feel really shook
and i think the word that
captures it best is shook
ptsd maybe
but just shook to your core
now let me ask you the second question
do you think he's sad
that he shot those
nope
nope why would he be would you be
would you be sad that you killed those
particular people in those particular
circumstance i wouldn't be
do you think that do you think that if i
were in this situation
that i would act shook
yes
would i have trouble even
forming words
maybe
probably
would i shed a tear
not one
not one
there would not be a tear because tears
are with sadness
and i don't think he has to be sad about
who he killed
in fact they were people if i may speak
frankly
that nobody's going to miss
i mean there's nothing to be sad about
so crying would look down at the crying
would look fake to me honestly if he had
cried i'm not sure i would have bought
that but being shook to the core
yeah that's human
that's human
all right
um follow the money so that's what this
is about have i told you many times
that even when people are not
consciously doing something for the
money
and even if they could pass a lie
detector test you put somebody in the
light detector and say are you doing
this for the money and they say no i'm
doing this because this is the right
thing to do
and they pass the lie detector test
it's still about the money
because people will always rationalize
and even even to themselves they'll
convince themselves it's not about the
money and they'll really believe it so
if you ask people
no matter how credible they are no
matter how much you believe them and
they say no it's not about the money
you can predict
where things will go by following the
money even when it's not about the money
so that so that's my take
follow the money always works when
people are doing things for the money
and they tell you they are if you if you
could ask them it always works then
but it also works and this is the part
i'm adding to the the existing theory
it also works when nobody involves
believes
honestly believes that they're doing
anything for the money it will still go
in the same direction as the money would
would suggest
all right
now
um
so here's here's the way the written
house story will go
the way that everybody can make the most
money is
he gets acquitted at least of the the
murderous charges gets acquainted there
might be some lesser charge there
um
and then there's riots
and then the fake news industry gets
everybody riled up and there's lots of
clicks and then everybody gets money if
you if you took the cnn analysts
and put them on a lie detector let's
imagine that light detectors work in
truth lie detectors don't work you all
knew that right
lie detectors are fake technology that's
that's why they're not allowed in courts
because they don't work
but if people think they work
you can learn things because people will
act you know anyway there's a longer
story about that but imagine
hypothetically
that there was such a thing as a lie
detector that actually worked
and reliably i'll bet you could put all
the cnn staff on it and say are you
doing this for the money
this is really about the money isn't it
i'll bet every one of them would pass
the lie detector no it's not about the
money i wouldn't do that it's about the
news
but the predictor
says follow the money
so it's definitely going to go to
acquittal because that's where they get
the most money because i would be the
most outraged
and uh
so here's more on that so cnn was trying
to make a story and of the judge
which now they're going to paint the
judge as a white supremacist
uh and there's no evidence of that
either right of course but they're gonna
make him look like he's part of the
problem and i guess he made a joke about
uh the asian food might be delayed
because of the supply chain problem you
know and he
he was obviously making joke
and uh cnn is saying that some asians
were offended by that
because it makes it seem as if the
supply chain problem is the fault of
asians
what
what
i'm pretty sure there's such a thing as
chinese food
now he said asian food because maybe it
wasn't all chinese
it could have been you know vietnamese
or whatever but
if you say a joke about maybe your food
didn't come because of the supply chain
problem
that's saying that the people who make
the asian food
are victims of the supply chain
he's saying
that the asians like all the rest of us
might be victims
of the supply chain problem
there's literally no thing here
about them causing the supply chain
problem
oh my god
there's literally nothing here
now there were some activists in the you
know asian community who made a thing of
it
but i don't think that needed to be
reported because activists will take you
know any any reason to connect to the
headlines to make their case
so i don't think you can listen to the
activists in the story like this but
really cnn do a little bit of
a little bit of filtering
a little bit of filtering
that blows my mind
um
and then here's a
another
this headline is on twitter you know
twitter puts their own little uh
they call out different stories on the
right-hand side of the web browser
version
and here's what they said today
overwhelmingly white juries will decide
both the kyle rittenhouse and amud
arboree cases
the system isn't perfect legal experts
say
now do you see what they're doing here
they're making you try to think that the
kyle written house case and the ahmed
arbury case
are equivalents
right they don't say it
but that's the clear suggestion that
these two cases have something in common
and they don't
they really don't
now
uh why why do you imagine that uh
overwhelmingly white juries are the ones
that got picked in both cases
with uh
why do you think that is
i don't know
i don't know
but
uh
certainly
both the alter
don't all the attorneys have the same
amount of challenges
am i wrong
don't you have exactly the same amount
of challenges if you're the prosecution
or the defense
so the jury is whatever the jury is i
mean it's not it's not because they
picked it that way
i mean they might try but there's a
limit to how much they can they can game
that system
so of course just framing the story in
this way and by the way i think this is
a good question
don't you it's a perfectly good question
i think you should be asking questions
about the you know the
racial um composition of your juries
so there's nothing wrong with the
question and i don't think we should
ever take our eye off of that it's
useful we should keep an eye on it but
it shouldn't be the the one factor right
it shouldn't be the one factor and when
you frame the story like this you're
just
you know playing to the narrative that
this is a racial thing in which it
wasn't
um
all right uh
apparently some uh progressives are just
learning
that uh kyle's victims were not black
because there's some tweets where people
are saying wait a minute wait a minute
this whole time you're telling me that
he didn't shoot black people
that's actually what a number of people
in the
left community believe
they've watched this story all these
months and months
and they thought the victims were black
sorry i said victims didn't i
good good catch
that's a good catch
the victim was uh
was kyle
kyle rittenhouse was the only victim in
the story the others were people who had
bad things happen to him
but the the victim of the crime was kyle
reynolds okay thank you for that
correction that that is a good
correction
so apparently progressives are just
learning that there that their bubble is
not getting real news uh and i saw some
compilations of tweets to that nature
and so i tweeted that and i said
to progressives
after you find out that you've been lied
to
about kyle rittenhouse
go google this phrase find people hoax
the find people hoax do it first on
duckduckgo
and then do the same search on google
and compare them
and then i advised them to wear a hat
because their head is going to come
right off
now i was asked
why is it that i keep going back to this
fine people hoax like why am i so
obsessed
with this above all other things
and the answer is it's the tent pole
hoax
do you know what a tent pole refers to
so the tent pole is the the biggest pole
that's the most important one holding up
a tent let's say a circus temp situation
if you can take the tent pole out it
doesn't matter how many other smaller
poles there are the tent's gonna
collapse
so
on the find people hoax i've been using
the andre agassi strategy
now andre agassi had a strategy playing
players who were usually were lesser
players but sometimes not so much
and usually everybody you play has at
least one strength
but they might have also at least one
weakness let's say the backhand is a
weakness and the forehand is the
strength
almost every tennis player would try to
hit more balls to their opponent's
weakness
because obviously that's where you're
going to get your points
you get to their weakness not to their
strength
andre agassi did the opposite
now not probably not every time but it
was one of his big strategies was he
would go after their strength
do you know why
because their best shot
is their tentpole
if if he goes to their tent pole shot
let's say it's the forehand they've got
a blistering forehand and they hit a
blistering forehand
what happens to the confidence of both
of you
not much change
not much change because you expected the
person to have that blazing flow
beforehand you expected them to make
some points off it and that's what
happened so your expectations were just
about where they belonged
but
what if
andre agus and the agassi can win two
well then you think oh crap
my best weapon doesn't work against
andre agassi and it could be he just got
lucky
it could be he just had you know two
points that you know the bounce went his
way
but in two points
he can destroy a player
completely
two points
that's the strategy
now you have to be as good as him to be
able to pull that off but the risk
reward is really good if you can take
out the tent pole
you win
and the rest is just you know the
details because once their confidence is
gone you just dismantle them
so the find people hoax is the one that
makes all the lesser hoaxes believable
you see that right if if you were on the
left and you believed the fine people
hoax you believed it actually happened
it would be easy to believe
that all of the smaller suggestions of
racist-like things could have also been
true
but if the tent pole is removed and you
find out that the press had lied to you
about something really important
and really basic you're going to
question all the rest
all right so this is an andre agassi
play
i don't know that i can take the tent
pole out
but when i saw people uh start to
abandon ship over the kyle written house
thing i saw an opening
and if i can make the kyle rittenhouse
story
connect it to the find people hoax and
get people to just google the two
sources duckduckgo and google and see
that they're completely different
one says it's a hoax and one says it's
real
if you
i'm pretty close to the tent pole
now if you also noticed if some of you
have been watching me now from for years
actually
going after every suggestion about the
fine people hoax you know i go after
pretty hard on twitter and have you
noticed that the uh replies
have changed a lot since the beginning
remember in the beginning i'd say it's a
hoax and i would just get slammed
by people saying that wasn't a hoax we
saw it with our own eyes heard it with
our own ears
now i still get that
i still get that
but one or two
right and they get slammed by the other
commenters who just show them the
transcript and and slap them down pretty
hard
so
at this point
that fine people hoax tent pole is in
jeopardy i'm not going to predict it'll
come down
but this is the closest it's been to
being wobbly and it is what i'm going
for because i don't think i can make any
progress
chipping away at the lesser the lesser
poles
i'm going for the tent pole
if i take out the tent pole it's all
over
so that's the strategy
all right uh biden's got some fake news
about him he was talking about satchel
page
who had been a member of what was called
in its day the negro league for baseball
now that's what it was called in its day
so in this day it wasn't considered an
insult because the the the folks who
were on the team
used the same language didn't mean
anything back then
so when biden was making reference to
satchel page uh he said
um
he said he was a great negro player
uh and that he
clarified that he was talking about the
negro league
and they use a player in that league
now of course the uh the right
took that out of context immediately and
you know says hey
he's calling black people negroes and
therefore he's really a racist
now do you think there's even one person
on the right who actually believes that
this is some kind of racist talk
i don't think so i don't think there's
even one person who thinks this is
racist but
uh i think
the right is having fun with it because
it's so similar to what the left does to
the right
so i think people are pretending as if
they're
you know they're gotcha because it's the
same game that's played in the other
direction so i think i think it's fair
is sort of fair game you could argue to
take this out of context just to make
the point
but
correct me if i'm wrong there's there's
no conservative who thinks this is
racist right
he just was referring to a historical
language
yeah
olinsky says make them live by their own
rules yeah it's a good strategy it's a
good strategy to attack it like it was
as if it were true but it's very much
not true
all right um
this is a story from the ap
and here's the story that you'd have to
be deep in the bubble of you know news
bubble
to to read this story and not and now i
have the reaction that most of you are
going to have all right listen to this
this is actually a quote from an ap
story today this is mind-boggling
it says one of the nation's two major
political parties appears increasingly
tolerant of at least some persistent
level of violence in american discourse
or at least willing to turn a blind eye
to it
which party are they talking about
is that a reference to democrats or
republicans
because there's one party they say one
party
all right let me read it again
and you tell me this is democrats or
republicans one of the nation's two
political parties
appear increasingly tolerant or at least
to at least some persistent level of
violence in american discourse or at
least willing to turn a blind eye to it
this is written as if
anybody can see
it's obviously we're talking about the
republicans and january 6th
and you know and related conversation i
suppose
now
how could you be blind to the fact that
the entire left has been cheering on
riots for for years
and that even political members like you
know maxine
uh maxine waters
is saying you should go you know harass
people
in public
or harass politicians in public and how
and even you know chris cuomo saying
that you know who said riots need to be
peaceful
how in the world
could your readers be so dumb
as to think that it's the conservatives
who are tolerating a little bit of
violence how could they possibly think
that like you would have to be so deep
in the bubble
that uh
it's just shocking that that's even a
thing anyway
um
here's a here's a persuasion tip
trying to change somebody's mind
directly almost never works so if
somebody says x is true you say no it's
not and even if you show all your
sources
it doesn't matter you're not going to
convince anybody of anything most of the
times
but sometimes you can trick people into
discovering the first clue on their own
and if they find it on their own
then they can change
so
here's a persuasion tip
don't just say you're wrong
give them some breadcrumbs
and see if they can find the path there
so you notice i said uh do
search on duckduckgo
and then search on google because if i
told them what was there it wouldn't
work at all
they have to have the feeling that they
found it down on their own
so i'm giving them the opportunity
to generate a feeling that they that
they learned it on their own by
searching for it
right that's your persuasion tip of the
day
um
i made a claim yesterday which i'm going
to stick to
that is uh one of my books had failed
almost everything and still win big
is the most influential book in america
right now
true or false
and by the way i'm not this is not
hyperbole this is my actual honest
opinion
based on all the feedback i'm getting
and the influence i can see on other
books etc the most influential book in
the country
i don't know about other countries but
in this country is my book how to fail
because systems over goals has taken
over i mean
pretty much it's almost universally
understood
the talent stack idea you see everywhere
and the number of people who have
read the book and changed their lives is
through the roof at this point
you know if i asked you in the comments
how many people read that book and lost
weight
have anybody seen me do that
let me do it here i'll just to prove
this i know the people on locals have
seen this before but for the people on
youtube
um how many people who read my book had
failed almost everything still went big
either
had a big win in in business
economically or a big win in fitness
big wins in fitness
or economics
now watch the comments
it's a lot
it's a lot
yeah
i can read them to you it changed my
life i lost weight
fitness both economics yes health
name one other book that could do that
i've never even heard of it
i've literally never heard of any book
that's done this have you
now there are lots of books they have
great stuff in them for example uh
back in the day there was you know the
seven habits of highly successful people
but that sort of aged out you know it
was it was great 12 rules i would argue
that uh my book is far more influential
than the 12 rules as as good as those
are
um now somebody said to me atomic habits
is sort of uh based on my book
or at least part of it is and what and
the author the author uh
author will tell you that by the way
all right um
i actually feel bad for scott well don't
we'll make you go away
all right
so the reason i mention this
is
shouldn't it be taught in schools
i i feel like something like this should
be taught in schools because it's
already proven itself
as as directly useful to everybody's
life in in the most important ways
um i was asked uh to defend my statement
this most influential book in america
um because somebody said no i think
that's the bible scott ah duh
i think the bible has you beat
does it
does the bible have me beat
now i'm not saying my book is more
important
i didn't say that
i'm saying it's more influential
have you ever tried to convince a muslim
to change to christianity by giving them
the bible
works sometimes
sometimes
but in general
it's not going to change your religion
is it
and i would i would argue that by the
time you you come to the bible most
people are already convinced you know
it's sort of a
sort of additional to it
and i would say also that the bible is
do a fact check on this isn't isn't
christianity shrinking
in the united states
fact-check me on that
is christianity growing or shrinking in
the united states i think it's shrinking
right
shrinking a little bit
um and is are my ideas uh growing or
shrinking
they're growing
right
so i'm i'm just being provocative and
nothing should be compared to the bible
you know there's some things that
nothing should be compared to don't
compare anything to
you know the holocaust
don't compare anything to hitler
don't compare anything to the bible
they're just they sort of stand alone
so i'm just being provocative when i say
that but
um
it is the most influential book in
america i believe at the moment
um
there's a politician who's trying to get
medical schools
to beef up their curriculums for
teaching nutrition
so that the medical professionals could
train their clients in nutrition and
there would be you know gigantic
benefits in health what do you think of
that idea what do you think of the idea
of better training
um
and i wouldn't be a law it would just be
some kind of recommendation i guess
do you think that would be good
to better train
doctors on nutrition
i feel like it's a total waste of time
correct me if i'm wrong
is there anybody who doesn't know how to
eat right
really
because i don't know anybody who's
overweight who doesn't know why
they just look at their plate
look at my plate oh here's a lie
it's right there
do you think there's anybody who doesn't
know you should eat less cake
maybe a little more sushi
something like that
i i don't know that the doctor
is even the right person
and and and do you have a doctor if you
went to the doctor and you've got
obviously you know you have a weight
issue that would
have an impact on your health do you
have a doctor who doesn't tell you to
lose weight
and and if they told you that could you
not figure out how
now again back to my book had a failed
almost everything still went big what i
teach is a system
for how to develop your own system
so in other words it's how to how to
figure out the easiest way to lose
weight to learn about it etc so that's
what i talk about i don't say use a
specific diet
i say
your process should be to learn as much
as you can about diet choices and what
what healthy things taste good and how
to season them and basically you use
knowledge
to substitute for
willpower
does that make sense
i teach you how to use knowledge
as a substitute for willpower
does that make sense
let me give you an example
if you didn't know how to make uh
food that was uh good for you also
tastes good
would you eat much good food probably
not right because in the long term
you're gonna go for the flavor so if you
didn't know how you lacked knowledge on
how to make
how to make healthy food taste good
then you would eat the wrong food over
time but if you simply had the knowledge
you would eat more healthy food and it
would be just as good as the other stuff
because you knew how to season it
so i say that you can use knowledge as a
substitute for willpower and that most
uh diet plans and even probably what
your doctor would tell you would be
willpower related and those always fail
because what why do willpower uh diets
always fail
is there anything i said already today
that would tell you why
will power diets always fail because
they don't take into account human
nature
human nature just doesn't have willpower
human nature is you go after the biggest
attraction that's it
if something is more attractive than
something else you go after and you
rationalize it later but you don't have
any willpower
willpower is not even a thing
this is a complete illusion
willpower is sort of the result it's not
something you have
so
if you simply knew that let's say eating
pasta
was a little bit better for you than
eating a white potato
and you like them just as much
then the knowledge that the pasta
doesn't spike your glycemic index as
much as the potato does if you just had
that knowledge
you could be
used no willpower whatsoever and just
say oh well i like them both the same
i'll have the pasta
knowledge is a complete substitute for
willpower
also because willpower doesn't exist
all right
so i think that uh instead of having
doctors
um
tell people about nutrition which i
think would just be redundant with what
people already know that my book should
be required in schools
because people who read my book lose
weight
because they're not using willpower to
do it i take willpower out of the
equation
all right
so that's the good way to teach
nutrition
all right
here in the category of can you believe
this person got elected to office
uh do you know representative
jayapal
i may be pronouncing that incorrectly
which i do not mean any disrespect by
but j paul j j paul
representative
anyway um here's what she actually said
this is an actual quote i swear to god
i'm not making this up
she actually said what i'm going to tell
you quote
she said that her constituents are quote
are not talking about inflation
by the way
they're talking about hey
i don't have enough money in my budget
to pay for the things i need to pay for
what
they're not worried about inflation
they're worried that their money won't
go that far
i don't even know what to say about that
like normally when i read the news and
somebody's being dumb i'll add something
to it to like you know round out the
story
there's nothing to add to this
this one you just look at and you go ah
how did she get elected
anyway
i saw that in a joel pollock tweet
anyway thomas massey
tweets in response to a foyer request
the cdc literally just admitted they
haven't documented a single case
of an unvaccinated individual with
natural immunity
spreading the virus so in other words
the cdc does not have one documented
case of somebody who got the virus
recovered
and then somehow
spread it later
which you know
certainly asks the question why uh
people with natural immunity don't have
the same rights as the vaccinated
now
the fact that the cd cdc does not have
that documented does that mean it
doesn't exist
does that mean it doesn't exist
because i'm not sure that's the same
exactly so i'll just put a little
little yellow flag on this one
it could be a really good point that
would lead us to some deeper knowledge
or it could be
that maybe the cdc just
i don't know
saw some studies but they didn't
document it themselves i don't know
something like that
so i'm not sure this means what we think
but it's certainly uh
it's certainly a flag
um
so here's something to make you lose all
uh trust in your government if you
haven't already so you know about the
fba fbi raid on project veritas right
so the project veritas guys were raided
by the fbi quite aggressively
and uh over nothing as far as we could
tell i mean it was over
biden's daughter's diary
but when you hear what project uh
veritas did with the diary oh here's
something really clever
i forgot to tell you about this
so project veritas is given this diary
apparently they didn't steal it somebody
gave it to him
and they could not verify that it was
real
and therefore decided not to use it
do you hear that
the people most reviled
for being you know
illegitimate by the by the fake news
industry
they wouldn't publish this
because they couldn't verify it was real
that's i mean
think about that
okay but here's the best part
here's the best part
so then uh apparently project veritas
uh offered to give it back
to
the bidens
maybe
either to the the rightful owner i think
to the rightful owner
through an attorney
and the attorney said no
and did not accept it
but also didn't
debunk it
oh actually i don't know if they accept
it or not but they didn't debunk it
do you know what that is
that's how project veritas confirmed it
was real
they confirmed it was real
by giving it back
how clever is that
because if if they had said oh yeah
that's ours
we'll take it back
then it's confirmed but also if they
said
no we won't take it back
and they don't say one way or another
whether it's theirs
then it's theirs
right
think about how clever that was
he actually confirmed it
by giving it back
or attempting to give it back and
whatever the response was would be the
confirmation
it's really clever so now that you know
that project veritas
did this and you also need to know that
project veritas was suing the new york
times over um some i don't know alleged
uh
wrong statements about them
and
now we find out that uh
i hope my story is not lost here and now
we find out that um
from harmeet dillon who's attorney i
guess she's an attorney for project
veritas and other things
and uh
and suddenly the uh
they the new york times gets tipped off
by the feds
about
uh
well anyway so so what are the odds that
the
the new york times would be
getting sued by project veritas and then
the feds would tell the new york times
almost immediately about the raid on
project veritas so in other words
there's a new york times
connection with the
feds
that is very disturbing
so that's that's the story
that
and it doesn't seem to be for the
benefit of the country right it's not
like they're they're both patriots it
looks like something super weasely is
going on here
and uh massive corruption
here's my mystery of the day bill gates
said
that vaccines only quote to slightly
reduce transmission
to which i said
wait what
the official story is that they greatly
reduce transmission like a lot
you know not like 20 i'm talking like
you know 800
times we're talking about a lot
but bill gates
who i i would imagine is one of the most
well informed people in the country and
smart
seems to believe the opposite of the
official story
why would that be
i don't know the answer to that and we
can't read his mind but let me give you
some more on this story
so then when i asked that uh somebody
sent me a study this seemed to indicate
but from september
they indicated that there was uh no
correlation between vaccination rates
and
lowering transmission
so there's an actual study of different
countries
and they they look at the vaccination
rates and they say there's no
correlation
the more vaccinated you are it doesn't
seem to have any any impact on
transmission
so is bill gates right
so he says so and you know he's pretty
well informed
and there's this serious study
of a number of different countries that
showed there was no correlation
and that would indicate
exactly what bill gates said that the
vex the vaccinations don't
reduce transmission
do you think that's the whole story
right there do you think i'm done
nope nope because it took about a minute
for uh jason lewis who is also a medical
researcher phd smart guy knows what he's
doing and you know he does medical
research so he's he knows how to do this
stuff so he looks at it and
basically he shows you the data that is
exactly the opposite
right in the united states for example
and the other thing said that in the
united states there was also no
correlation but according to jason lewis
who seems very credible at least as far
as you can tell on twitter
shows us the data that sees the opposite
it's the exact opposite and strongly the
opposite
what do you think of that
so what is true
we've got one study that we can't verify
that says there's no correlation
we've got another study that says oh
yeah it's really strong here it is
well
let's say a few things about the study
that said there's no correlation
do you think that anybody can compare
countries different countries and
determine uh that one variable in that
country
worked it's not a thing
if you wanted to find out if the
vaccinations were reducing the spread
you would need two countries that are
exactly the same
not sort of similar in your mind but
exactly the same
and one with vaccinations one without
then you might have something especially
if you did multiple countries with
multiple scenarios like that but
if you're just looking at
an apple and an orange which is what any
two country comparisons are because
there's lots of stuff different in every
country
if you're looking at an apple in an
orange and you say the apple did better
than the orange
you really haven't said anything
because there are all kinds of
differences between an apple and an
orange and why are you picking out one
variable and imagining that that nothing
else is changing let me give you a hint
of what else could be wrong do you think
there's a correlation between how
vaccinated a country is
and how aggressively they test
there is right
the
probably the most
advanced countries with the best health
care systems the ones who would
vaccinate the most
probably also have the best testing
so if you test more do you find more of
course you do
right so you should expect
you should expect
that the more vaccinated you are the
more testing you're doing too and you
should have the most cases
where they're the most vaccinations
because they're looking for the most
cases
right
doesn't that make sense to you
all right here's another one
how many of you had this experience
after you got vaccinated you changed
your behavior to riskier behavior
anybody i did
did anybody change their behavior to
riskier behavior after they got
vaccinated
yeah look at the yeses
all right there's still some no's
but
it looks like most people did i
did
let's say you had been single
if you had been single
and you were unvaccinated
do you think you might sit it out
and say ah i don't even think i'm gonna
date
now let's say you get fully vaccinated
and you know you say i'll only date
somebody who's fully vaccinated well
then you're going to go nuts right
because you're going to say well that's
close enough i got the risk down to
where i want it i'll do that
so the other thing is where it's where
people are most vaccinated they should
also be the least cautious
how do they how do they calculate that
um how about this
and do the places that have the most
vaccinations also drop the restrictions
well of course
of course because if the vaccination
rate gets high enough it's harder to
keep all the restrictions on
so so there's that too
all right
so i don't believe that bill gates is
necessarily right on this and i'm going
to take a stand against him
on this question
now
remember i taught you that if i sort of
make a statistical
argument it doesn't mean i'm wrong if it
doesn't happen it just means that that's
how statistics work
so
here's my thinking
here are the parts i think we do know
about the vaccination it makes it far
less likely that you'll get it in the
first place true or false
would you agree that being vaccinated
has a big impact on whether you get it
in the first place
seeing some differences of opinions so i
think separately from the infection rate
i think that we do know that
that you're less likely to get
now
so so vaccinated you're less likely to
get it do we also know that it will
clear up faster if you're vaccinated in
other way in other words if if a
vaccinated and unvaccinated person get
infected at the same time
won't the vaccinated person recover and
say half the time
i think so
so i would say that common sense
which is you know often wrong
uh and logic dictate that if fewer
people are getting it and they're having
it for less time even if they said the
same viral load
vaccinated people would spread it way
less
even if they had the same viral load
because they have it for half the time
and they only get it maybe 20 percent as
often
so um i would say this is one of my
opinions that you've got to put a really
big
question mark on
because i have a question mark on my own
opinion i could easily be convinced in
either direction at this point i could
easily be convinced
so something some to watch for
um
john kerry is giving china a pass you
know he's the main climate guy so he's
not making trouble
in china about the uyghur situation
ethnic genocide and so i tweeted that
hitler's biggest strategic failure was
not making germany's economy essential
to the world supply chain
before he embarked on ethnic genocide
but china did it right
if you're going to do ethnic genocide
you need to make the world dependent on
you first
and then they'll let you do it
so i always thought that never again
was not just specific to the jewish
community
you know i suppose it is though i mean
when i see this happening i guess i
guess the never again is just
for the jewish community because it's
happening
there's an ethnic
cleansing going on right now so you
can't say that didn't happen again
because it's happening right now
and uh
john kerry doesn't seem to care as long
as china has a supply chain
all right um speaking of supply chain uh
joshua steinman who you should follow on
twitter also
um expert in cyber security as well as
other things he said he used to
coordinate uh under trump he coordinated
the u.s supply chain policy
when he was on the national security
council
and he had some ideas that i tweeted you
can go see him you should follow him
joshua steinman s-t-e-i-n-m-a-n
and his you you'll find him easily and
uh
he was talking about creating american
manufacturing hubs
so in other words you pick a region
that's the perfect region
transportation-wise and energy-wise
and you just build um all the parts
for let's say microchips
or some other zone might be you know the
full supply chain for some other
industry and apparently
you know it works in some asian
countries and it's just a good model but
i don't know that we have anybody in
this country who could organize
something like that you know maybe we
need more of a totalitarian
government to pull that off i don't know
but it's a good idea and we should um
try to study a subject first
scott
james let me talk to you
james james first of all
if you and i
so james says try to study a subject
first scott
number one james
the odds are
i know more about these topics than you
the odds are you're wrong
and i'm right and it makes you think i
didn't study enough
why do i say that
this is my my usual experience
doesn't mean i'm right all the time but
the only the only reason that uh the
only reason i get to do this
is because i'm right more than most
people
so statistically speaking if i didn't
know anything about you
i would say i'm probably right and
you're probably just wrong and it looks
like i'm wrong because we disagree
number two
try to understand what this live stream
is
if you came to this live stream for
science
well you're pretty dumb
because this isn't science
if you came to this to see uh what
questions
the public has
because the the fake news is not giving
them everything they need this would be
a good place to come
because i try to approach the news like
a consumer
i'm not trying to approach the news as
an expert
if i were approaching as an expert then
yeah
i'd do a deep dive in everything i'd
have to before i talked about it but i'm
doing it as a consumer who looks at the
news and says i'm not getting any news
here
why don't i have any news why is the
news lying to me
right so that's
that's the point of this live stream is
to be basically on your side asking the
same questions that you would ask
but on top of that i have one expertise
maybe two if you count business but
persuasion and
risk management decisions are areas that
i do have expertise in
and
uh so in those cases i'll go deeper but
for everything else
um i'm taking a consumer's view and i
and i think that we need to lean on the
media and science to answer these
questions
yes and detection i think i add
that to the mix as well
so
uh
i keep being asked about norm mcdonald's
fictional autobiography review
um i gotta tell you i'm not gonna read
it
so you could ask me every day and
and you do
you ask me every day and i'm sure it's
good
i just
i'm i just i'm not going to read any
books
i don't know when the like next time i
read a book the only time i read books
is on airplanes and i'm not flying
anywhere
so i have no no plans to read a book
anytime soon
and i also think that in the world of
the internet
reading an entire book
is um doesn't make as much sense as it
used to
so
if you're entertained by it sure but uh
if you're doing it for information
you can find the summary somewhere
oh somebody says bill gates is uh
increasing the
the demand for therapeutics
maybe
maybe
um
yeah there there have been years where i
wrote more books than i read
i don't know if anybody could say that
besides me
um audible books are still good yeah
especially if you're doing something
if you're exercising all right that's
all for now
and uh
oh i ran long

to you
tomorrow
