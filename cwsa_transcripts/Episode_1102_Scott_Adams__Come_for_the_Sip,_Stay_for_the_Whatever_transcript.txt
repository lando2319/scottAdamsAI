hey where is everybody
come on in it's time it's time for
coffee with scott adams
this will be one of the most
unique and novel dare i say novel
uh coffee with scott adams you'll ever
see
yeah it's a new look and if you'd like
to
engage in the simultaneous sip i know
i know you do all you need is
watch me do this for a memory a copper
mug or glass
a tanker chalice or stein a canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the dopamine of the
day the thing that makes
everything better except possibly this
hotel room
and it's called the simultaneous sit it
happens now
so um i'm out of town
although i may be returning to town soon
sooner than i hoped the uh the fire
that's near where i live in california
in the east bay
as now uh the evacuation zone is
extended to
right next to my neighborhood so the
next time they extend it
i will be taking an early flight back
and uh
clearing out my house and grabbing the
animals and making a run for it
um i'm hoping that doesn't happen i
think it's a 50 50 at this point
but the it looks like they're going to
make a stand
uh the fire department's calling in lots
of out of
an estate and other help and it looks
like they're going to make a stand
on a certain road that if they succeed
would be a really big deal so they'd
save a lot of houses
um but enough about me do you want to
hear about the news
yes my house is in danger not not at the
moment
but i'd say the odds of losing it or
maybe 25 do you know how hard it is to
enjoy your time
away from home if you think that there's
a 25
chance you'll come back to a charred
ember very hard
very hard to enjoy my time off let's
just say
if you're going to plan some time away
don't do it when your house might burn
up that's just that's my
vacation advice for you now you're
probably asking
scott why are you laying on the floor
well i'm in a very high-end
hotel situation here it's actually sort
of a
kind of a home and somehow they they
designed this
so there are no um there are no outlets
in any place you would have want to use
an outlet
so the only place in this whole place
that i could figure out how to set up my
situation here
was lying on the floor in the corner
next to the waste basket
so that's about as good as i can do
because my computer was
low on power let's talk about all the
fun things
so the funniest story of the day is that
richard spencer you all know richard
spencer
most famous well maybe second most
famous racist in the united states
and one of the organizers of and here's
the fun part
the charlottesville uh
tiki torch guys all right so get this
one of the organizers of the
charlottesville racist
event richard spencer just endorsed
biden
could that be any better that's right
spencer is endorsing biden now a
spokesperson for the biden campaign has
has denounced him and you know said we
don't accept that
but where is biden himself
is that good enough for you you know is
it good enough that a spokesperson
denies the endorsement i have to ask
myself
if a racist likes biden
doesn't that make him a racist joe biden
doesn't it well i think it does i
learned this from democrats
i learned that you become whoever
endorses you
which is weird because all the people
that who endorse you are different
but you become all of them
simultaneously that's what they told us
with trump that if anybody bad ever
endorsed him
then trump must be bad because those are
the people who are endorsing him
right totally uh it's logical
so if richard spencer endorses biden
i don't make the rules that's their own
rule
ah excuse me why roll on my stomach here
trying to find a way to be comfortable
so
that's going on and
i can't think of anything that's funnier
than that now the beauty of it of course
is it's all ridiculous and nobody cares
what this one person
you know thinks he may be trolling
we don't know but it puts him in the
news
do i hate the fact that the organizer of
the charlottesville
event which later the media turned into
the charlottesville
fine people hoax do i mind
that he's in the news again no i do not
somebody says did i get a chance to see
the vice special on charlottesville i
did not
but i wouldn't trust device for anything
so
i would i would expect that whatever
they came up with
might not be that credible
so anyway the the rules that the
democrats have taught us
and i think we should play by their
rules because they're very clear and
they make so much sense
one is that biden is a racist because a
racist
endorsed him that's i mean i think
that's just obvious
you know qed and then the other is that
he confirms that he's a racist by not
denouncing him
now you say to yours now you're saying
to me scott but his spokesperson
denounced him right away
oh no that doesn't count no
spokesperson denouncing i want to see
joe biden denouncing him personally
and when he does do you know what i'm
going to say because he will
do you know what i'm going to say i'm
going to say i'm going to look at my
watch that i don't
have on my hand and i'm going to say um
that took a long time how long does it
take
to denounce richard spencer
i mean should that take a day
i mean you've got twitter you know you
know what twitter is you have a phone
just tweet it out joe biden i denounce
him
um so those are the rules
somebody says so you're confirming david
duke and trump
are racist i'm just saying that the
rules need to be the same
so it looks like the only people running
are racists this time
so if you want a non-racist i'd
recommend kanye
really you know if that's your thing so
all right enough about that um so
speaking of biden who i like to call
 joe biden
because as i've described
too often by joe biden making the
charlottesville
find people hoax the centerpiece of his
campaign
that's maybe stupid maybe he doesn't
know it's a hoax
but by now somebody's told him by now
somebody's told him it's a hoax by now
he's certainly
read the transcript okay probably not
but uh in any way he's either really
stupid
or he's really evil those are the only
options if you're
making that the centerpiece of your
campaign but abc interviewed him
david muir david muir has been in my
home
it's one of the small worlds sort of
thing david muir interviewed me
years ago when i had my voice problems
nice guy but he interviewed biden and
he asked him about the allegations of
his
cognitive decline and this was
if i can do a my best impression of joe
biden
when asked on camera about his cognitive
decline
here was joe biden's answer
no i don't have any cognitive decline
i think that my impression was right on
pretty pretty close in fact if somebody
tuned this in
and they just saw that impression of joe
biden they would probably say oh look
it's joe biden doing another speech
they probably wouldn't even know it
wasn't joe biden until this part where i
say i'm not joe biden
i'm not joe biden i'm just doing such a
dead-on impression of him over
laughing now here's the thing
the overlap is really a tell
all right uh let me give you another
example
of where the overlap can tell you
something
hey uh scott did you murder that puppy
murder the puppy
who would never think i'd murder a puppy
not me so always look for the overlap
as your confirmation of the thing being
true
now the other thing that biden said
which which might
which might get him poisoned by kamala
harris by the end of today
is he said during that interview that he
would consider running
us for a second term if he wins the
first term
yeah oh yeah he said come on man come on
man
so biden is saying that he would run for
a second term
maybe he's not ruling it out if he wins
the first term
what do you think kabul harris thought
about that she was she was probably
you know watching the interview for the
first time like everybody else was like
oh let's see how
the top of the ticket did joe biden said
he
might run for a second
term
[Music]
and then she called putin and asked him
who his poison guy is
who's your poison guy putin send him
over here
um kellyanne conway
is announced she's leaving the white
house you all know the story her husband
george conway
from the lincoln project anti-trumper
and then
her 15 year old daughter got involved
in social media and was calling on her
mother for being a trump supporter
and kellyanne decided to step away from
her job
one of the highest profile jobs in
america
and at the same time her husband george
decided to step away from the anti-trump
stuff the lincoln project
and concentrate on the family and i have
to say
i gotta say i respect that
um i also have this weird respect for
the whole family
i i know i know i'm probably all alone
in this
but there's there's something there's
something awesome
about uh not only how brave they all
are because they'll all do everything in
public
so they're really brave uh they're all
smart
you you assume the kids are probably
smart too and
they've all got incredible guts and
they'll put just put anything out there
it's like they they just operate on some
different level
where there's no filter it seems all
three of them have that
at least the ones we know of including
the daughter
they all have that no filter thing which
i don't hate
i don't hate that you know
they've got some stuff to work out it
sounds like but
i just kind of like their spunkiness the
whole family if they ever did a reality
tv show
when you watch that can you imagine a
better reality tv show
than the conway's i'd be all over that
alright so the president
gave his uh gave his little press
conference yesterday and announced that
uh i don't i forget i don't know the
details on this convalescent blood
plasma thing
i was traveling when all that happened i
didn't catch up but apparently he's
he and the fda have said that that's now
on the table
so i don't know what it means yet in
terms of the
blood plasma because it took about one
minute for jake tapper
to tweet that it was an unproven
possibly ineffective treatment
have you ever heard that
somebody says you mocked the child a few
days ago i did not
i did not and you get blocked for that
so
mischaracterizing my opinion in public
always gets you blocked um
so i did not mock the the 15 year old
not not at all
um so what was i saying oh yeah so
 me excuse me i gotta plug in my
laptop before it dies on me so
um the cod pleasant plasma
stuff so every everybody knows that's
you take the antibodies in the blood of
somebody who's recovered
give it to somebody who needs it and you
know about half of them will do better
or something
but there's some dispute about whether
it works or whether it's lasting or
whatever
but don't you think that all you need is
a commercial market for that
and it would be huge because right now
it's sort of a volunteer sort of a
situation isn't it
do you know fact check me on that but i
think that
we don't quite have a structure set up
that there's one
way to get blood plasma it's just sort
of on the table now
here's what i'd like to say i'd like to
see a bounty
that rich people would pay to find
somebody who's got the right kind of
antibodies and to
donate them so that that rich person can
actually get those antibodies
if you make this a free market situation
and i don't know if you can
because of there may be some medical
ethical reason you can't do that
but if you could that would be enough to
make it widespread because the rich
people would overpay
and that would subsidize the people who
couldn't afford to pay
so you'd have to have some kind of a
situation where it doesn't go only to
the rich
but a typical situation is that the
people who can pay
overpay that subsidizes some people who
couldn't afford to pay at all
might be a free market way to make that
work it could be big
uh trump also stirred the water by
tweeting
um tweeting an interview that uh
levin did with dr harvey rich of
yale and dr r-a-s-c-h is it rich
rich he's a
highly qualified yale kind of guy and
expert and he thinks that
hydroxychloroquine
is in his words the most the most
obviously
proven effective thing of all time i'm
exaggerating a little bit
but in his view the the evidence is
unambiguous
uh i don't know if that's true i'm still
putting hydroxychloroquine at
30 percent chance of being a big deal
and that there's some conspiracy to
cover it up which is pretty big
30 chance that it's a conspiracy does
not give you
much confidence in the system
so but i like the fact that trump hasn't
given up on that
and that there's there is evidence that
he's right
so i tweeted a uh a very smart looking
article from rob henderson
who's on twitter and he he talked he
wrote an article about
luxury beliefs which is totally worth
reading
it's like a really good read and so
you'll see it in my twitter feed this
morning
and the idea is that there are some
beliefs
that are purely impractical for other
people
but you look good if you adopt that
belief so an example would be
rich people in favor of uh lots of
immigration
because if you're rich that sounds very
big of you yeah we
you know all people let them in but it's
not you will pay
you just get you know maybe a gardener
and a chef
because you have cheap labor so it's
really easy to be a rich person
and be in favor of immigration because
the people who get
you know get the shaft from that are the
people who are competing for the jobs at
the lower end
so he talks about it as luxury beliefs
and uh he does a good job of tying it
into
other crazy things we do for example the
reason that
luxury brands exist at all is so that
rich people can overpay for them
right it's the overpaying for something
that's not really that much better
that makes it a luxury brand and it's
the overpaying
that other people can notice they'll be
like oh wait a minute
you've got one of those 25 000 handbags
if people can recognize it hey you've
got this expensive watch or this big car
and people know that the person who has
those things is maybe not getting that
much extra
utility out of them except for the
signaling that they have so much money
that they can buy dumb ass stuff and
if you look at the the black lives
matter protests
you've got you know a full range of
people at the
you know at the street level if you will
the people protesting
probably lower income for the most part
and but the people who are a higher
income
also in many cases are in favor of the
protests
but they're not the ones who have to pay
for any of this right they
they don't have to worry about the
schools being bad they can
send their kid to a prep school or
whatever and
they can they have the freedom to be in
favor of something that's just
nothing but bad for black lives
but act like they're being virtuous even
though their belief system is just
terrible for the people that they think
they're
supporting so anyway he does a better
job in his article i'll just point you
to that
um one of the funniest things that's
happening right now is
you know you all know brian stelter on
cnn and he wrote a book
that many have said i'll use i'll use
trump's
phrase when trump wants to distance
himself from an idea but
still get it across he'll say many
people have said
that brian stilter's new book is a
is a rip-off of mike cernovich's
film hoax now hoaxed is one of the best
things i've ever seen
it's actually really really good for uh
for any kind of a film documentary
or or other uh is one of the most
enjoyable
pieces of content i've seen in years
actually
and of course i'm biased because i'm in
it but it's not the part that
that i'm in that's the good part it's
just the whole
the whole way it's organized and the way
it finishes is just amazing
but anyway so brian stelter has a book
with a similar title
without the ed on the end just hoax and
he has somebody on
i guess yesterday this uh peter
parmarensive and he likened
president trump's frequent use of the
word hoax
to an information war game and this
guest said
he says it's a tactic used for
undermining people's faith in anything
and in the long term what this does is
it makes people feel helpless and
passive
because if they can't rely on anything
out there that means you can't change
anything
which means you need a strong leader
like trump or putin
like trump or putin really those are the
only two strong leaders he could think
of
the first two that came to mind were
trump and putin
this ridiculous ridiculous
propaganda network anyway for
for brian stelter to be on the hoax
network the network that does almost
nothing but push hoaxes all day long
it's primarily it's like their main
business model is hoaxing
and he has the guts to bring people on
and talk about how it's bad for
president trump to call out the hoaxes
now here's my view
if there were no hoaxes and the
president was calling things that were
real
hoaxes that'd be pretty bad
wouldn't it wouldn't you agree that if
the president
were looking at things that were
actually true
and he was saying in public that these
totally true things were hoaxes
that could be destabilizing for a
country couldn't it
or it could look like politics as usual
if you
unless you were born yesterday but i
like to think that calling out a hoax
is actually better than not calling it
out
it seems to me that calling out
falsehoods in the news
actually is a public service
so that was hilarious
uh so trump's use of the worst word of
hoax is poisonous was the
the title of the piece uh at least
online and i'm thinking to myself it is
poisonous
for cnn it's only poisonous for cnn
because they're the target of it
all right portland is
uh getting a little worse because the
action in the
cities the protest spilled into the
suburbs
now there was no violence but
there will be because apparently now
that
the right wingers know that they can go
there to punch people
and they can get away with it i told you
the story of the
the gigantic right-wing guy who punched
the
85-pound i don't know what he was he was
smaller
uh antifa person but the anti-far person
punched first so i think i think the uh
the right wing
have realized that because antiphon has
been so bad at punching
that they can go down there and they can
take the first punch
as long as somebody's filming it because
if somebody films you taking the first
punch
you can kind of just take them out
that's the law
literally it's the law if somebody
punches you in the face
it doesn't really matter
if they're smaller than you i think
you know i think if somebody who's a
let's say for
my example 125 pounds
punches directly in the face or attempts
to
somebody who's say 200 pounds
it's completely legal for that 200
pounder to take that
take that person out right that's not
illegal it's not like they're a
professional boxer or something
they're just bigger so
i would not be surprised if right
wingers start to see this as a sport
oh somebody says it was a girl it might
have been
um it looked like it could have been
when i looked at
when i looked at the video i was like uh
i can't tell the gender but i don't want
to be that
misgendering kind of a guy
all right so there's going to be more of
that
and and then when uh
ken uh what's his name the
oh cuccinelli when he when cuccinelli
was asked
about this whether trump intends to send
federal officers back into the city
guccinelli said this president hasn't
taken any actions off the table
i always tell you that the thing that
makes trump
in many ways better than other
presidents in this particular way
is that he never takes an option off the
table
even when you're sure he should he
doesn't
he just never takes an option off the
table and that makes him very
unpredictable
which is what he wants he tells us that
you know specifically
it totally works so um
there's that at the same time there's
another wisconsin shooting
of police shooting a black man in the
back
and now when you hear that you say
please shout a black man in the back
what what's your first thought
oh my god there it is again the police
are out of control
they shot somebody in the back there's
no way to
justify that right right there's no way
to justify
somebody being shot in the back unless
you watch
the video in which case i think i would
have shot that guy in the back as well
because here's what happened the if you
watch the video you'll see that the
police
stopped a guy he's outside of his car i
didn't see what happened before that
but the the person they stopped ignores
police telling him to stop turns his
back to them
and walks toward his car now they follow
him
yeah they're not shooting him in the
back just for walking toward his car
but he opens the car and he reaches
inside
and he refuses to do anything the police
are telling him to do
now if somebody is refusing to comply
to police and then they go and they
reach into their car
and you can't see what they're reaching
for
and and you know that it's nothing good
because you know he's obviously
resisting rest
do you have the right to shoot him at
that moment
because he's created a situation in
which he may or may not
come up with a gun
i feel like you know
it's a it's a gray area i feel like a
lot of people would have shot him in
that situation
now the police were not in imminent
danger
but let me give you this um you know
hypothetical
let's say there was a somebody they just
stopped in the street
and he's facing him and the police say
put your hands up
and and he puts him up at first and then
he starts to reach down
and he reaches in his pocket really
quickly
all right and then the police officer
has a gun on him
and he says get your get your hand out
of your pocket get your hand out of your
pocket
and then he doesn't is the police
officer allowed to shoot the person
who has not shown them a weapon all he
did is reach in his pocket
maybe he was reaching for his wallet how
do you know
i mean maybe there was something he
wanted to show the police officer that
was relevant
and he just thought it would be okay
could the police officer
shoot somebody who reaches in their
pocket
during a stop i don't know but i think
so
now somebody said a shot seven times
yeah because
i think they weren't shooting him in the
head they were shooting him in the body
because they weren't trying to kill him
well i don't know if they were trying to
kill him but they were certainly trying
to stop him
if they'd wanted him dead his head was
right there it's not like they would
have missed
because he was it was literally point
blank so
uh but it looks you know once the
shooting started i think maybe the
he wasn't the only one shooting so i
guess the seven bullets pretty quickly
i don't think they remembered every shot
they get pretty worked up in those
situations i would think
all right here's the most interesting
story
i would say the odds of this being true
or not very high
so put your skeptical hat on
because this is the most skeptical
topic you could ever have kim jong-un
is rumored by a south korean diplomat
have you ever heard of this before a
south korean diplomat
who said something about north korea and
then later it turned out not to be true
don't think this is necessarily true but
it's interesting
he says that north korea korean leader
kim jong-un has fallen into a coma
and his sister is poised to take over
now is it um
is it true
is it true that kim jong-un
is in a coma because if it is
i want you to hark back harken back
think back
to the time when it was rumored by a
south korean
diplomat i think that kim jong-un was
dead or in a coma
do you remember that wasn't too long ago
and what did i say
i said huh they showed video later
to show that kim jong-un was not only
alive but he was doing great he was
walking around touring some facility
and what did i say when they showed that
video to prove that he was up and
finally he was healthy
i said i don't think that's a current
video
i think that might be from some time ago
and so i challenged the world to show me
a living kim jong-un
from that day forward that wasn't on
video something we could confirm
was definitely really him alive and
maybe there has been i may have missed
it but
the bigger picture is i don't think the
south korean diplomat
is necessarily credible
so i wouldn't i wouldn't assume that we
know anything that's happening there
all right um
i believe that's what i wanted to talk
about
yeah there's a kim jong-un rumor every
30 days as somebody saying there
kim jong-un is on the roof
so i do wonder what would be different
if his sister took over
because partly you think to yourself hey
maybe the sister will be less of a a
hard ass
you know maybe she'll be more willing to
work with other countries and stuff
maybe totally possible you you know it
could be the sister is
you know the big break that makes
everything possible that's totally
possible
the other possibility is that
she has to be even more of a hard ass
than her brother was because she has to
prove herself
you know she has to try harder to prove
herself so i would worry
that at least on day one if she were to
take over
hypothetically if she were to take over
on day one i think she would probably
come out hard against
the united states and probably try to
you know rattle a saber or two
um
all right so we'll we'll wait on that
there's doing the same thing with joe
biden so
so biden's answer on the video the where
he laughed too hard that i talked about
his answer was watch me just watch me
and you'll
and therefore you'll know that he
doesn't have any cognitive decline
and i'm thinking that's what we
that's where we got it from watching you
is why we're asking the question so it's
sort of like
you know i won't do a bad analogy
but it's sort of like something that's a
bad analogy
so so i'm being
called my attention has been called to
hawke newsom on
martha mccallum and black lives matter
um i haven't seen that but apparently he
made some news
was he being extra radical because that
seems to be where he sort of
ended up i assume that he was being
extra radical
wondering what my weight training
program is any pointers
well i'm certainly not a role model for
weight training
but i just do it regularly if you read
my book
have failed almost everything and still
win big
you will you will see my
my description of using a system instead
of a goal
and if you use a system whatever one you
develop for yourself
that's your best situation oh what's the
next hoax
coming before the election well if you
could
if you could predict them they wouldn't
be good so they they sort of have to be
unpredictable
but if you if you wanted to say all
right what would be the
category that would be most damaging to
the president
so if you were going to invent a hoax
you would find something that people
are already primed to believe is true
and you just want to give them some red
meat that it is true
so they'll either go it'll either be
fake racism
fake sexism uh at least
at least the allegation will be fake you
know uh
i think it'll be one of those
all right uh what do you think of kamal
harris's uh
surgery on her it looks like she had
cosmetic surgery of some
type have you noticed it because
i guess she when she appeared on camera
before it was fully healed
and she looked a little a little not
herself and my
expert told me that that's going to look
really good pretty soon
and i would do i would say that uh
she she did take some years off of her
appearance
so i would say uh
it uh it did make her look younger and
so i think that's good but it also made
her look different
which is the whole point to look
different i'm not entirely sure
that it was an upgrade but what do you
think
probably was took a few years off her
all right yes a hundred thousand teach
black person now
so hog newsome says that uh every white
person owes every black person eight
hundred thousand dollars
well with all due respect
i don't know if hawke newsom is
as good with accounting as he is with
activism he's good with this activism
stuff
but this is an interesting question
if you were going to calculate
how much your reparation should be how
would you calculate that
because what would you compare it to
because that's the the key right
the accurate comparison would be
if slavery happened versus whether it
had not happened
so you'd have to say for those people
who were put into slavery
and then therefore their descendants who
were in the united states
what would happen if that had not
happened would they have been better off
so you would compare to what their life
would have been
had there been no slavery and what their
life would have been would have been
life in the african continent because if
there'd been no slavery that's
where the descendants would be so the
proper
analysis which is not very popular
the proper but not but not popular
analysis would be
how much money would you have made if
you'd if you'd still been there
now there's the second thing which is
the pain and suffering of
slavery itself but typically we don't
compensate people who have long passed
so if you look at the japanese
internment situation
i believe the reparations for that only
went to
living people who had been in the the
camps
when in world war ii when the japanese
american citizens were rounded up and
tragically put in camps
by the way my an old uh girlfriend of
mine
from years ago her brother had been in
one of those camps
so this this the issue of the japanese
internment stuff
is really close to me because i i
personally knew
i don't know i probably personally knew
10 people who were in those camps think
about that
i personally knew personally spent
lots of time with them 10 people who
were put in prison camps by the
government of the united states
for exactly zero nothing they were just
japanese
japanese americans they weren't even
japanese they were americans
um that's a that's a hell of a thing
now in that case i think reparations
were
completely understandable but they were
far less than they should have been
because when when the japanese citizens
were put in the internment camps
they often left a property behind
with nobody to take care of it because
it was their family
home or family property and when they
were in the internment camps
white people just stole it they just
stole it
so there were people who owned property
when they got out of the camps no longer
owned it
and they had no recourse it just wasn't
theirs anymore
so when they got their little checks of
i don't know
fifteen thousand dollars or whatever it
turned out to be it wasn't really
it was not really close to compensating
what a lot of them lost
now if you go back to slavery and
reparations
you see if you take the standard that
you don't compensate people who are
already dead
like the japanese internment camp
situation
and you only compensate the living then
the calculation
is how are those people doing in the
united states in terms of standards of
living
income wealth etc compared to what would
have happened
if they had just their family from long
ago
had been in africa so that would be the
proper analysis
in which case and then the second thing
you'd have to do is you'd have to
calculate any social benefits
that were let's say beyond the average
you'd have to figure out what was beyond
some normal amount
but you probably have to figure out that
and then you'd have to take the cost of
i don't know would you would you have to
calculate the cost of
the prison system the cost of
any welfare payments or any property
crimes
would you calculate the cost of the
riots
would those all be in the calculation
they should be
now so if you did it right and by right
i mean not socially right
this would be socially completely wrong
but economically it would be it would be
accurate to say
that there's probably no no money owed
if you did an
actual thing now in terms of the evil of
it
the evil of slavery is uncontested right
well i mean nobody's arguing that it's
evil isn't evil
so that part is true it's just that we
don't compensate
people who have passed it just doesn't
work that way you couldn't really have a
civilization
where everybody who is already dead
gets compensated for something that
happened while they were alive
because how far back would you go would
you go back i mean
you know we have a civilization where
people are living on lands that were
conquered three four or five times
uh somebody says a friend got 21 000 but
wished his parents had lived to see it
yeah not just live to see it
well you know actually it wasn't even
about the money
exactly it was more about the
acknowledgement and i think that meant a
lot to the japanese
american community
um by the way hawk newsom should not be
underestimated
because the fact that you were begging
me to say something about him
is what makes him effective meaning
that he he triggered you so that you
just
needed me to say something about him
yeah and that triggering is what makes
it good
so in the same way that i can
consistently praise you know trump and
even
kaepernick and aoc i give the same props
to
ognusom he does know how to get your
attention
and that's that's a really big part of
what he's trying to do
so if he got your attention he did his
job
and that was obviously what he was
trying to do
now if and he's also making a big first
offer
uh you know if you hear that number 800
000 per person
and then someday it got negotiated down
to 15 000
wouldn't you say to yourself 15 000
doesn't sound so bad i was worried it
was gonna be a hundred thousand
so making a big first you know
first offer and also being provocative
uh that's all good he knows how to do
this
none of this is an accident don't don't
confuse a hawk
with maybe some protester in the street
who is less sophisticated and just
spewing crazy stuff when hawk says
something that sounds crazy
he knows it that's different
if it's a person on the street who's
spewing crazy stuff
they may not know it they may not be
sophisticated enough to know that what
they're asking for is
unreasonable mohawk knows i mean he's
he's
you know trained attorney he's he's
lived in the real world he knows what
he's doing
so in terms of capability you know don't
underestimate him that would be a
mistake
all right um that's all i got for now
i'm gonna go
uh go enjoy my day and keep an eye on
the fires and
see if i gotta go home but thanks for
joining me
uh i might see you on the floor tomorrow
or not
that's all for now
