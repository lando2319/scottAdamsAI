[Music]
yo i woke up today and i thought to
myself i wonder if
chicago is ready for the simultaneous
sip and then i saw a comment
go by just as i was thinking that says
chicago is ready
good work chicago
well
today
is an amazing day
for all of you
not only are you lucky enough
to join us all here for the best thing
that's ever happened it's called coffee
with scott adams
but the rest of your day is going to be
pretty good too
pretty good
and if you'd like to make this
a little extra
no i know you do i know you i know you
you like a little extra all you need is
a copper mug or a glass a tanker jealous
a steiner canteen joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah
yes i see a comment on locals
wondering if in chicago when you do the
simultaneous sip
do you time it to the gunfire
or do you just do it
plain and let the gunfire do its own
thing sort of syncopates
i always wondered about that
well and possibly the biggest news in
the entire world um
although i might be biased
uh a hotep jesus on uh twitter has
suggested that i need new cakes
uh for those of you who are not up on
the latest language
kicks means
footwear
i need some new footwear because
apparently
i'm unfashionable
and if we start from the ground up
well i could be 100 years old before
we're done
but
let's get the footwear right first
now here's the problem
do you know who makes a stylish clothes
for old white guys
anybody who makes uh can you give me the
name of the company that makes stylish
clothes for old white guys
that's right nobody yeah that's that's
correct nobody
nobody
it's not even a thing
but
uh because i identify as black i'm
hoping that will give me some style
advantage
which i can say because i identify as
black if you said it it would be racist
but
um i need all the help i can get so
let's work on that top priority for the
country
rasmussen had a poll
about gun ownership
and
can you guess what percent of households
have a gun
now when i say households i mean at
least one person has access to a gun
within the home
what percentage of the total population
do you think
or we could do it separately what
percentage of uh republicans do you
think
so republicans were only 51 i thought
it'd be i thought it'd be a lot more
wouldn't you expect republicans to be
you know 75 plus
but even if you look at the whole
household
only 51 percent
had guns dems are at 38
this was the most surprising thing
there isn't really that much difference
between 51 and 38
when you're asking yourself you know who
likes guns
democrats have a lot of guns
i'm not sure i quite understood that
democrats were so gun heavy
but it explains a lot doesn't it it
explains why uh
why gun ownership or gun rights remain
uh robust there's just plenty of people
who have guns
um
and then rasmussen asked
people's opinion is that if the federal
government had a list of gun owners
how likely will they someday use that
list to confiscate your gun
32 percent said very likely and
this is of all voters
and 21 percent said somewhat so that's
53 percent think it's very or somewhat
likely that their guns would be taken
away so over the half the country
over half of the country is concerned
that if they're on a list their gun will
be taken away i feel like that's a
pretty reasonable
worry
you know there's a lot of stuff that
i'll push back on but i do feel like
this is quite reasonable
and it's part of a larger trend isn't it
which is the more the government knows
about you the more control they have
you know how uh knowledge is power right
the more knowledge the government has
about you the more power they have for
you
and the less you can get away with
right
um if they knew exactly how you did your
taxes they might
they might want to talk to you
um
so
and i i think there's something about
humans
that we don't like to admit
but i'm going to admit it on behalf of
all humans
there are a number of perfectly
legitimate reasons to want privacy from
your government you don't want them to
have too much power
you just don't want people in your
business freedom etc right so there are
just plenty reasons to not want the
government in your business
but one of the big ones we never talk
about
is that most people are crooks
we don't say that one
but the fact is if the government knew
what everybody was doing all the time
we'd all be in jail
pretty much everybody's breaking some
crime
you know even if you're just speeding
you're doing something
probably you've probably defamed
somebody i mean the you know although
that would require a lawsuit but
um yeah
if you if you took it to the level of uh
cheating on taxes
pretty much everybody be in jail
pretty much
um
yeah ken says he celebrates the right of
liberals to own guns but it doesn't work
the other way yes that's true
um
all right
so there's that um apparently school
according to axios had a report that 40
percent of school districts
uh in more than a thousand districts
they use federal money to upgrade their
hvac systems or their air handling
systems
and the filtration because of covent
so 40 of schools did that
but they have no idea if it makes a
difference
and apparently some of the schools are
saying wait a minute wait a minute
before we finish installing this
can somebody tell us if this works
is there any evidence whatsoever that it
changes the covid situation and the
companies putting them in of course
don't have that evidence
and apparently the
the air filtration industry is totally
corrupt
did you know that
i guess we could have guessed
there are some industries
that you don't think about as being
corrupt
for example the food
food distribution industry
grocery stores grocery stores are just a
criminal enterprise you just don't know
it now i'll talk more about that in the
future but the whole food industry is
just
thoroughly corrupt
you know i spent enough time there to
see things that were just jaw-dropping
and i'm talking about normal big
companies that that you would know the
names of the company doing things so
unethical
or maybe illegal i don't know
but it's a really corrupt industry but
it turns out that the air filtration
industry is also just garbage
and they just make up
they make up test results or they they
test in a way that's completely
you know unrealistic so that they can
get good numbers so uh
so i guess billions of dollars have gone
toward this thing that nobody knows if
it works i still think it probably does
even if all it does is uh circulate the
air better
so i'm going to be on the side that says
or the prediction i guess
that in the long run we will find the
airflow is all that mattered
anybody want to take that bet
here's my bet
in the long run the only variable that
will that will be predictive of who had
who had coveted and who was at risk will
be airflow
and that everything else will be
and then vitamin d will probably be the
most predictive of outcome
but in terms of transmission i'll bet
it's just airflow
i'll bet it's that's it about it that's
it when was the last time somebody got
covered in a place that had good airflow
can somebody tell me
because these days we tend to be
fairly good at guessing where somebody
got something right
when was the last time you heard
somebody got it outdoors
like never
when was the last time you heard that
somebody got it eating at a restaurant
restaurants are actually
pretty good airflow
right they tend to have higher ceilings
you know they're built for lots of
people in them so i would imagine they
have pretty good airflow
the restaurants in california nobody
wears a mask
during eating
and you're all packed in this room
but have you heard of
a big problem with restaurants
you haven't right
we would know by now if people are
getting this in restaurants wouldn't we
apparently they don't
and the only thing that i can think of
that would make sense for a restaurant
is that the airflow's a little bit
better
i mean if nothing else people are coming
and going so the doors open a lot right
but i think they they generally have
pretty good airflow
um
so i that's that's my prediction it will
be all about airflow
because of the uh the aerial the
airborne nature of this compared to
other viruses
um
article in inside sources by kenneth
raposa
he talks about the climate deal and how
china basically wins
and until he laid this out
i didn't realize how bad it was
but i'm just going to give you the facts
without much spin that i don't think
there's any spin on this
just the facts
trying to
agreed to
basically reduce some coal use right so
china agreed
to reduce coal use by 2030.
do you think china will do that
so that's china's part of the deal
is that they would re reduce coal use by
2030.
what happens if they get to 2030 and
they decide not to
no penalty right
no china can just say they'll do it and
then just not do it
there's no penalty
so did we get anything from china
except their promise which is worth
exactly zero
mean laughably zero i mean we don't even
think there's any chance that we keep
their promise right
but it gets worse
so while china is going to do basically
nothing that's what that's what they
agreed to do
effectively
the united states is going to go really
hard as solar panels
so we're really going to you know
increase our investment in solar
do you know who makes solar panels
china
[Laughter]
basically
biden went over there and negotiated a
deal where china would give us a promise
that they're not going to keep about uh
coal but we're going to keep our promise
almost certainly
to vastly
buy more stuff from china
now here's the thing we buy the the
solar panels from china
but who pays for the disposal of them
because they're pretty toxic and hard to
get rid of that's us
so china gets the money they do nothing
in return
and then we get the the pollution and
the unreliable source of electricity
now when i say uh
solar is unreliable there are at least
two technologies that will change that
number one would be something like the
tesla giga plants
apparently if you build enough of these
giga plants you'd have enough storage to
use these less dependable sources
and still have a bad resource to you
know work at night and stuff
the other is hydrogen
apparently there have been some pretty
big
advances recently in hydrogen
and hydrogen stores stuff fairly
effectively better than batteries
actually so hydrogen storage can last
longer
than a battery storage
and some big stuff happening in hydrogen
hydrogen so we might actually um by
brute force
get to a point where solar actually is
more practical than it is right now
but at the same time
nuclear is already there right
so nuclear is where
solar wants to be i know can solar get
there maybe
but nuclear's already there
uh alex jones
i guess you'd say he lost by default
this sandy hook family's lawsuit against
him because
i guess he had been claiming that the
sandy hook shooting massacre
was actors and
it wasn't really
a real massacre that the people were
actors
so the families that lost people in the
actual real massacre that was not a
giant hoax at all
sued and i guess alex jones did not give
them the documents they need
so he wanted to keep his i guess
probably private or financial documents
private which means he he defaults so he
loses the
lawsuit just by not cooperating
but they haven't decided on the penalty
yet
what do you think the penalty will be
and do you think alex jones would be
able to pay it i don't know if there's
any insurance that would cover this i
doubt it
how much do you think he's gonna have to
pay
and will it put him out of business
have they taken alex jones completely
off the table
and
is it obvious to you that one by one
every trump supporter from 2016 is being
cancelled
no i'm not saying that they don't
deserve it all right it's not my job to
defend somebody else's speech
you know they said stuff
they got sued it's their problem not
mine
but it does seem fairly consistent that
everybody who is a trump supporter is
being targeted one way or another
now let me ask you something has has tim
poole ever been targeted recently for a
by hit piece
i bet he has because i don't know that
can anybody tell me has there been a hit
piece on tim poole recently
because if there isn't there will be
right
oh yes i'm saying uh yes yes big yes
yeah so tim poole has also been targeted
so we've seen joe rogan now i'm not sure
i would call him a trump supporter but
just the fact that he's willing to
you know deal in the middle of
you know the reasonable middle it makes
him look dangerous i guess to the left
um
what's fake news
what is fake news
somebody's saying that's fake news but
tell me what you think is fake news
oh he says he has
oh what do you mean whether tim poole
has been targeted
now of course bannon's been targeted etc
um oh not true about alex he provided
everything
well the court doesn't think so the
court says he didn't
that's all i know
okay
um yeah rogan is not a trumper for sure
but he can see
you know he sees things
through a non-political filter which i
think by itself is is dangerous in this
world
all right here's what i would like to
see um just to cause trouble i would
like to see a graph
of which liberal pundits match which
conserve the pundits
do you know what i mean
like who who on the left
is there alex jones
who do you think that would be
who on the left somebody on msnbc right
who's who's the guy on msnbc
there's a black guy an nbc msnbc who
um
is an expert in maybe cyber or security
or something like that
what is his name
and
somebody will come up with it here in a
moment
uh
you know who i'm talking about right
nance yes nance
so nance maybe is the alex jones but
what here here's the graph i'd like to
see so try to picture this
imagine a graph that's sort of a big
upside down u shape
right at the top of the u
would be any pundits on the left or
right or maybe the middle who basically
are pretty close to center
right so i would put for example
smurkanish
from cnn i know you're thinking wait
that's cnn he can't be unbiased but he
he's relatively unbiased if you watch
his content you don't you don't pick up
anything that you pick up in the other
the other cnn content so i'd put like
murkonish at the top
and then maybe maybe you'd put a few
other people maybe maybe uh joe rogan
somebody else so it'd be a little bit
subjective of course but then uh oh dave
reuben dave rubin's a good example
um
but then as you go down to the more
extremes you know with the alex jones
here who would be the one on
on the left you know joy reid
but anyway wouldn't you like to see that
yeah i guess greenwald would be at the
top at the top probably
anyway that's the graph i want to see
so let's talk about this written
written house situation i think you're
all following it and you know that the
jury went home
i don't know if they've started again as
the jury started again
so my understanding is and i would say
this would be unconfirmed report
would you agree this is unconfirmed
but uh we're hearing you know
we're hearing the whispers
jack pasabic is reporting on this
that
there are two jury members who are
holding out because of concerns over
their own safety
how many first of all how do you think
that's true
do you think it's true that two jurors
are holding out because they're
concerned for their safety
now be careful
be careful because you want to believe
it's true right
so as soon as there's something that a
story that's a little
a little too good
you should automatically be a little
more alert that maybe it's too good for
a reason you know
so i'm going to say you should remain
skeptical about what's happening in the
jury room because i don't know that we
there's any way to have a reliable
report
this early
uh but
i will say that uh jack's sources are
better than most
so if i had to guess
you know if you said you know
uh you just have to put a bet on this i
would bet it's true
that's where my bet would be but you
know i'm going to remain 40 skeptical i
guess
now
what do you think of those two jurors
choice let's let's call it a
hypothetical until it's
confirmed but suppose
there were two jurors who
presumably were going to vote to acquit
can we make that assumption
can we make the assumption if that there
were two holdouts
it probably meant 10 wanted to acquit
and two also wanted to acquit but didn't
want to take the chance
is that your interpretation
we don't know that to be true but that's
sort of a reasonable interpretation
right
now what do you think of those two
jurors
in the comments
do you do you back them
meaning that their choice was right for
themselves that's the only standard here
was their choice right for themselves
i'm seeing some yeses i see a no
some people understand
i see yeses cowards
cowards
okay
can i make a confession uh which i don't
think will land me in jail
i hope not
uh i once got out of jury duty
for the same reason that the uh
alleged two people are holding out
imagine me on a jury
now imagine that um you know i was well
known at the time and it was it was a
case in which the
guns were involved i'll just be generic
so guns were involved it was a dangerous
situation that's what the trial was
about
now
if i convicted somebody as part of a
jury
what are the odds that my name would
come out as one of the people who
convicted a guy and it was a third
strike
so this was the one that puts him in
jail forever
what do you think
it now all the other jurors could be
reasonably anonymous
right
so if i had been also reasonably
anonymous i wouldn't have any problem
with it
that's
the benefit of being anonymous
but i can't be anonymous i don't have
the option of being anonymous
so in my case
should i have been excused just
automatically
and the answer is yes i should have been
excused because it would have put me at
risk
and the system doesn't require me to
take that kind of risk when there are
other people who could do it without the
risk
so what do you think i did
do you think i waited for the court
to decide how safe i would be
 no
no
no i'm not going to listen to the court
to tell me
how safe i'm going to be
right that's my decision
that's it there's no there's no debate
that's just my decision same with say
the same reason i'm against you know
vaccination mandates
you you can't decide what my safety
level is that's up to me now if the if
the if the government
is trying to keep me too safe you know
like being a little too cautious well
maybe i'll have some pushback on that
too but if the government is telling me
to take a personal risk
that is unnecessary
in other words you could get the same
result for the public
with somebody who's not me right just
some other juror
um
i'm sorry that's where the government
and i part ways
that that's when i say i'm sorry i don't
support this government because you
can't put me in danger personally
not personally
right if you ask me to volunteer
well that's different
you know suppose the government said you
know look you're going to be in a little
bit of extra danger because people will
know your identity
so you know if you don't want to do it
that's fine but if you volunteer we'd
love that
okay then i'll be okay
because it's me volunteering but the
government making me
give up my identity because that's what
would happen
no so let's just say that i got out of
that trial on a uh
let's say that my reason for getting out
of the trial was true
but it wasn't the only reason so i did
give a reason for to be excused which
didn't go over well with the court
well i'll tell you my reason
i told the court that i favored complete
drug legalization
and since drugs were part of the part of
the thing they were like okay you're out
of here
so
um and that was true enough that i
wasn't lying
all right
um apparently the written house
prosecution
did not give the defense the high
quality version of the drone footage
which
would have looked very different from
the enhanced version or the the low
quality that um
that was shown in court
now
i don't know where the line is
apparently uh
prosecution has something like a total
you know total protection they can't be
prosecuted that's true right
the prosecutors have absolute immunity
can somebody
confirm that i saw that on twitter it
looked drew
um
they could be disbarred sure but there's
no legal
uh recourse right they can just lie they
can introduce fake evidence right
am i wrong about that is there
i don't think it's qualified immunity i
think it's absolute
so that's actually the the question
whether it's qualified or absolute
i think it's absolute
so i i think the prosecutor probably
knew he could just make up anything now
i would say that what the prosecutor did
by any normal standard would certainly
qualify as a horrible crime
does anybody disagree now it might it
might be a protected category if he's
got immunity as a prosecutor and by the
way i think prosecutors probably need
immunity
you know i don't like it in this case
but
you know if you had to if you had to
create a system
i think the system's better when the
the attorneys are not worried about
going to jail
so i i get why we have that law but it's
certainly bad in this case
anyway
i uh i completely back the uh two jurors
and i think they're heroes frankly
because i think those jurors need to to
stand up
to uh a system that apparently they're
being doxed or they will be pictures
have been taken of them etc
there have been threats
um i i have a little problem with the 10
who stayed or the the 10 who are willing
to make a judgment
i think the two who are refusing are the
heroes here has anybody did anybody
disagree
now i don't like the fact
that this will hurt a written house
i don't like the fact that ridden house
might not get an acquittal outright
because i think he needs an acquittal
to navigate the rest of his life right
if if the only thing that ends this
trial is uh what's it called a
mistrial uh
with prejudice
meaning that they wouldn't retry it he
couldn't be retried
but if you hear that somebody uh was
convicted of murder i'm sorry if you
hear somebody was accused of murder and
the only way they got off was a mistrial
are you going to hear the with prejudice
part
i mean you don't want to hear those
words right you just hear this mistrial
you say to yourself my god he got away
with murder
right
i mean you're going to think he got away
with murder or at least everybody in the
left will
and that's not anything like what's
happening that's the opposite he's that
he
instead of calling it mistrial with
prejudice you know what they should call
it
extra innocent
am i right if you call it a mistrial he
sounds guilty
in my mind
even though it doesn't mean anything
like that
but in my mind he sounds guilty am i
right am i the only one who thinks that
if you hear mistrial don't you think
guilty
yeah
here's what they should call it extra
innocent
he's so innocent you don't even need a
jury to decide
he's so innocent
that the judge can just say you know
i'm just going to take care of this
myself
that's how innocent he is
he's extra extra innocent don't call it
a mistrial with prejudice
because that is prejudice and that's
basically
going to screw this young man for the
rest of his life
he can't have this hanging over him
and so that's my only problem with the
jurors but
let me back the jurors completely
the jurors have the option because they
are americans living in a free country
to put their own safety
above the benefits
to the defendant
and while i hate it
i hate it that they're in that position
they have an absolute right to put their
own safety above the defendant
agree or disagree
they have the complete right
without any criticism
they will not be criticized for this
to put their own safety above the
defendant it's not their job
it's not their job to protect this guy
he's a stranger
right it's sad but true yeah i see some
of you disagree and i respect that
so
those who disagree and think those
jurors should just you know
man up or warming up whoever they are
and uh give us a verdict and take the
risk i i get where you're coming from
like i'm not going to reject that
but
my personal preference is that those
people have their absolute freedom to
protect themselves
and that the core system is less
important than that as important as it
is you know protecting the core system i
think is really important as i've said
the court system is the jewel
in the republic
if you don't have a court system the
rest doesn't matter
uh you got off a jury yes i did get off
a jury but i also served on a couple of
juries
so when i was a little less famous
but still famous enough but people
didn't recognize me by by my face
i did serve on a couple of juries and i
recommend it by the way
if you've never served on a jury
i think that you're missing out
because it's an experience that binds
you to the country in a way that i've
never i've never felt i suppose if you
join the military
you feel you know maybe psychologically
bound to the country in like an extra
way seems reasonable
but doing jury duty just just the fact
that you're serving your
citizen
duty and seeing how the whole thing
works like actually you know breathing
it and and feeling it and being part of
it gives you a really different feeling
about the whole thing
and the thing that i like best
is the seriousness with which every
person
took the process
everybody from the spectators to the
judges to the defendants everybody
were buying into a system that they
respected
even if they wanted you know get out of
jury
service of course you know people need
to take care of themselves too
but you do get a new respect for the
system and you see everybody else
respecting it too including i think even
the defendant
so
uh i have a lot of respect for the legal
system warts and all
well joy reid is going full racist of
course talking about something called
there's a thing for white male tears as
soon as they get caught they bring the
waterworks so this is more of the white
fragility and white people are defective
racist
uh joy reid you're a racist
and
i
i think you should be
disrespected everywhere you go
so i don't think uh i'm not really
willing to like defend any of this
anymore in terms of
you know free speech and opinion stuff
when stuff is just flat out
just flat out
racist let's just call it what it is joy
reid
racist
i told you yesterday
that
that i've been challenged about cnn's
reach
and i said if you think the cnn's
ratings their ratings on tv
has anything to do with their reach
you were mistaken their reach is the
website
the cnn model as i understand it this is
my interpretation of it is that they
create content on live tv
and that's sort of just marketing
for the website it creates content and
it's the marketing for the website the
website is where they make the money if
there's any money there i don't know
but here's some numbers they have by far
the the most visited news site
by far
and even uh fox news is way behind
so their website gets 379 million
monthly visits so that's not people
that's
that's visits but there's still a lot
uh msn gets 329
so they're up in that category but
not quite and then fox news is 266
million
so fox news is quite a laggard on the
website
now
correct me if i'm wrong
yeah i am wrong about that never mind
cancel that
um but here is uh
here's the sort of thing the cnn is
spreading with their 379 million monthly
visits
there's a clip
of one of their pundits bakari sellers
and he it's a 15 second clip
talking about ridden house
in 15 seconds
bakari sellers told
four lies
about the trial
and by lie i don't i don't know that he
knew the truth so let's just say it's
inaccurate because you can't read his
mind right we don't know his intention
but
but the facts are fairly clearly he had
you said four things about it in 15
seconds and all of them were untrue
now why do you think a pundit for cnn
has four mistaken impressions
in i don't know how many more he has but
four of them in this many seconds
and i think the answer is that he
watches the news on the left
presumably
so he basically he's a victim of fake
news so he gets fake news and then they
put him on tv
to spread the fake news that he got from
his own fake news
so he's not really making news he's
repeating the fake news which they can
treat as making news and make a clip out
of it so this is like circular fake news
engine they've got built here
pretty impressive
all right uh here's some uh fake news
about uh bill gates but this is a this
is a double fake
the news is fake
and so is the fact check
that's a it's a double fake news all
right
you won't believe this unless you read
it yourself
i'm going to tell you something so
jaw-dropping
yeah maybe not in today's world but
you're going to have to read it yourself
because you're not going to think i'm
interpreting it correctly until you see
yourself you'll think i'm making this up
so reuters does a fact check on bill
gates
and they they set it up this way
they say in a recent interview
that's circulating on social media the
gates said that vaccines quote only
slightly reduce the transmissions
and that became viral because it sounded
like you were saying the vaccines don't
work
but
this is fact checked as a false because
it's out of context
all right so so watch watch the trick so
you got to pay attention carefully or
you miss the trick
which is why it's a good trick because
you have to pay attention carefully and
people don't so what gates said
and this part is not in dispute
he said that the vaccinations only
slightly reduce the transmissions
now
that was fact-checked as
as basically
not false
but here's how they fact checked it
they said it is true that current
covalent vaccines do not halt the
transmission of the virus
okay
was bill gates talking about vaccines
halting or not halting the virus
not really i mean
he says that
only slightly reduces the transmission
so he thought it
so he agreed
that the vaccines do not halt the
transmission so so far the fact check
just agrees with him
they both agree
that
that it doesn't stop transmission and
now here's their punch line and the the
fact check
summary
they say
this is reuters however they are highly
effective at preventing severe disease
wait a minute
that's not the topic
that's not the topic
bill gates said nothing about uh severe
disease he talked about transmission
and to support bill gates
instead of backing him say oh yeah it's
true what he said
or that is false
they actually changed the topic for the
at the end
they changed it from reducing
transmission to
preventing severe disease and then they
fact check the preventing severe disease
part
what the hell
if you didn't read the whole article you
wouldn't know
that they didn't fact check it they they
made up something to fact-check and then
they fact-checked the thing they just
made up
uh unbelievable
like i
you know of all the fake news fake crap
and fake fact-checking i've seen this
one just like really stands out as as
not even trying
now if you go to politifact
can somebody tell me does politifact
lean left or right
uh is political politifact do they lean
right or left you're saying left i'm not
sure that's right
you all think left
oh okay maybe
but now is that just because you think
all fact checkers lean left
all right i don't know the answer to
that so i'm going to say i'm skeptical
that they lean left but maybe they do
um but their fact check says that a
vaccinated person is significantly less
likely to pass the coronavirus so
another whereas political politifact is
saying that uh bill gates was just wrong
and as fact so bill gates says it only
slightly reduces the transmissions but
politifact says the opposite that it
greatly reduces transmission
so
who are you going to believe
are you going to believe writers that
failed to say he was wrong or politifact
that didn't say he was wrong
so you've got two fact checks
but they're different
so
do we need a fact checker for the fact
checkers
i feel like the fact checkers themselves
need some kind of a rating but then that
would just put a fact checker above the
fact checker and then who checks that
person's facts and we're we're kind of
really flying blind here aren't we
i think politifact was the one who got
to find people hoax right
i think it was the other fact checkers
that got it wrong but i'm not positive
about that either
well representative corey bush
tweeted something that
something never happened
she says quote when we marched in
ferguson white supremacists would hide
behind a hill near where michael brown
jr was murdered and shoot at us
they never faced consequences
and then she said something about kyle
ridden house except that none of this
ever happened
none of it
she just completely made up white
supremacists shooting at them
who makes that up
who makes up white supremacists were
shooting at us
well corey bush did
do you think she will lose your job over
that
no
no
so corey bush is sort of the alex jones
of the left in this case i guess
um
all right and uh there is one story in
the news and i'm not going to tell you
which one
but this is just context
all right so there's one story in the
news and maybe one i talked about it may
be one i haven't mentioned i'm just
going to say that one of the major
stories in the news is totally wrong
and well totally wrong in the sense that
the context is completely missing and
they did they don't know the context but
i do
so there's one of the stories where i
know some context that would completely
change
what you thought about the story
but
as in many cases i can't tell you how i
know it so
um
well just one story that i happen to
know the background that apparently the
news industry doesn't know
so
um
it's time to drug test congress all
right so
uh what do you think is going to happen
with written house
oh then why say anything the reason i
tell you that i know things that are not
in the news is part of the context is to
tell you how fake the news is
it was part of the gel man amnesia
concept that if somebody knows something
about a topic they know it's fake news
but if you're not an expert in the topic
you can't tell you're like oh that's
probably true
it's funny that all the ones that i know
about are fake but this wasn't so i'm
just giving you another example
that there's a major story that
literally maybe only a handful of people
in the world know is fake i just happen
to be one of them
um
all right uh
so what do you think will happen with
rittenhouse
how much
rioting do you think will happen
because i feel like the left might know
that this is uh too far
what do you
think i i'm gonna go with very little
that's gonna be my take i think it'll be
mostly pundits talking about it and
lying about it like
you know like uh
like what's his name bukari sellers i
think just the pundits will lie about it
i think that the 500 national guard
threat
will be enough and i also think that the
writers don't want to make
written house look right
if there's rioting
rittenhouse looks more innocent
you know what i mean
the context of writing would simply make
his actions seem more justified
and i'm not saying i'm justifying them
i'm saying that
persuasion-wise it would look more
justified so i think the left would be
smart enough at least the organizers i
don't think any organizers would be dumb
enough to organize around this
because i think they know this would be
too far
just too much of a bullshitty thing to
to take
uh and i think they could use the excuse
that there's you know 500 national guard
there and
do it now i do think there will be a
smattering of just people independently
saying hey i think i'll go down there
and complain
but i don't know that it will be
organized by anybody smart
not the way blm is organized not the way
antifa is organized because they do have
some kind of leadership
that seems to be you know at least smart
enough to know
when to
you know when to play and when to hold
them
i give the left too much credit well we
have that's how we can find out
now i've told you since the beginning of
my
political commentary that the only
credibility you should give me
is what i earn through prediction and
that everything else is just
entertainment
and if i can predict better than other
people
um then you should give me a little more
weight
than people who are bad at predicting
and that's all that's that's sort of
that's the best i could do
so that's my prediction that the uh
um
the organizers of riots will be too
smart to organize this one so whatever
happens would be in unorganized and
smallish maybe opportunistic and that's
about it
how does follow the money apply to the
jury verdict
well there there's no motive stronger
than fear
so fear beats money
maybe it's the only thing i can't think
of anything else can you
i think fear beats money
uh and there may be some identity stuff
that does but not as much
lust and sex
peace money yeah maybe
does baiden want riots i don't think so
i think riots would be bad for biden
um
i i'm seeing somebody on locals saying
that i live in the california bubble
so i give the left far more credit than
it deserves
nobody deserves any credit
nobody deserves anything
but i would look but if you have a
specific example
that'd be great now if you're saying
that i give the left more
credit than they deserve i feel like
that's exactly what i'm aiming for
if you're detecting i'm giving them more
credit than they deserve that's exactly
what i'm shooting for
because it's the only way i can be
credible
when i disagree with them is by starting
with giving them more credit than they
deserve
so i guess i guess i would accept that
criticism as true
but i think you're wrong that it's a
negative
it's it's intentional
um
soros yeah i think
who knows how much soros is behind
anything i'm not one of these soros
conspiracy people but it's certainly
true that he donates to causes that you
may or may not like
exactly
somebody wisely saying on youtube
that if you if you can't land on a
target exactly you have to decide
whether you're going to overshoot or
undershoot
and when i'm giving credit to the left i
would prefer to overshoot
and give them more credit
strategically
um
all right is wokeness just mass hysteria
drummed up by the left media
i think wokeness is a power play
and that's the only way i see it
a lot of these things you know we we
couch them in terms of you know what's
fair and good and who can get away with
what but some of these things like
abortion and gay rights and a lot of
stuff is just a power has nothing to do
with what's right or wrong
if if the people who
believe that they're oppressed
have enough power
then they change things
so i just see stuff as power dynamics
and nothing else
woke is boundary seeking behavior
infantilism
hmm that is an interesting intellectual
comment
which i'd have to think about
i feel like that wasn't
i don't know i have to think about that
sounded smart
um blind spot scott what's my blind spot
so that's the kind of comment that
uh just doesn't help
now i've told you before that it's more
exciting to be wrong than right
does anybody else have that feeling
you know if it's about money you don't
want to be wrong or health
let's say two categories if it's about
money or health you don't want to be
wrong if it's going to cost you money or
cost your health
but isn't it more exciting to find out
you're wrong about something you thought
was true all your life
i i find that exhilarating
because when you find out you're wrong
about something you thought was true all
your life you just got smarter
not only about that thing but about how
easily you can be duped
that's kind of important
um
or marriage
so how many of you think uh changing the
topic because i saw a comment there how
many think that um
china is in for a big economic reckoning
uh for any variety of reasons they've
got a bubble they
they close the border
i don't know
yeah i feel like
china's
got a big economic bubble
and
here's a dog that's not barking
can somebody tell me what progress there
has been
for by americans
meaning specifically about creating
manufacturing plants in the united
states
can anybody tell me if anything has
happened
well and here's the way i'd look at it
how many let's say manufacturing
operations moved into china before the
pandemic
and how many american manufacturing jobs
have gone to china
since the pandemic
what do you think
i feel like the number of companies
going into china may be zero
but i would love to know what it was
before the pandemic
you know was it was it a hundred a month
and what was the number because a lot of
them would be smaller was that you know
three big ones a month
that could really be important
you just don't know
but don't you think that that story is
lacking in any kind of coverage
i would say that maybe the biggest
you know security thing that's going
is how much we can pull our
manufacturing out of china and our
supply chain stuff so if we don't have
any reporting on whether we're at least
slowing down our china business
what do we know
if you don't know if we're slowing down
or
sending manufacturing to china
and reversing it ideally if you don't
know that
we don't know anything
because everything depends on that
really just everything
uh yes if we don't know it it's not
being managed that is correct
um
china is number one in slavery
uh yeah you'd have to be an idiot to
invest in china at this point
i actually saw an article recently in a
major publication
arguing that investing in the chinese
stock market might be a good deal right
now because it's it's depressed at the
moment to which i said
what actual american would write that
article because i think it was written
by an american
what american
writes an article that says investing in
china seems like it might be a good risk
reward at the moment
uh
that sounds like somebody paid by china
doesn't it
i mean it
definitely doesn't sound like something
an american would write
um
i've already seen articles like that
yeah
all right
that is all i have for today
i'm gonna go do some other things
uh
huawei is just a foreign intelligence
operation yeah you know i invested in uh
i think i told you this
when huawei was having his problems i
invested in ericsson because erickson is
a competitor for the
telecom equipment
and i thought that was a no-brainer
i thought that investing in huawei's
competition would just be the easiest
investment of all
because huawei would be prevented from
competing in europe
erickson would not be
there aren't many competitors so
erickson would just make a ton of money
but it went down
my
my erickson investment just like went
down
what's happening now i don't have
visibility about that industry at the
moment so it was a dumb investment it
was more of a political investment than
an investment investment
but
uh
no
oh can i return live if the verdict
comes down today
i will consider that um
but it depends where i am and what i'm
doing i get a big day
today um
invest in nokia
is nokia the other uh
the other one
all right everyone who's thinking like
you
all right um
somebody's saying
look into the concentration of lottery
winners in sandy hook that should give
you enough to learn how wrong you are
about the situation
no i don't think you know me that well
i don't think the number of lottery
winners
in sandy hook is going to convince me of
anything
but
i don't think so all right i think i'm
going to go
slow news today until the ridden house
verdict uh oh erickson was kicked out of
china somebody says interesting
all right
uh and i'll talk to you again
tomorrow maybe today
