dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I'm pretty sure there's never been a
better time this morning
and if you'd like to take this
experience up to
levels that you can only get with a
prescription all you need is a cup of
micro glass so take your choices diet
again teen Jugger flaska Festival kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous set
up go
oh good lord that's good
that's some good good coffee
all right well you might to be aware
that Florida Florida's new College of
Florida
I didn't know how to say that without
saying Florida twice but it's Florida's
new College of Florida
apparently they're floundering and a
huge percentage of their professors quit
because Mino DeSantis Governor DeSantis
and
some Republicans told them that they
couldn't teach uh
some kind of brainwashing to
kids so they all quit
I feel like I just don't feel like the
details of this story are necessary I
mean basically the summary is the
governor said they can't teach
destructive to children and so
half of the teachers quit like we really
really do want to teach them destructive
 like my career was really based
on this so
that's the whole story
there's nothing else to say about that
correction
do you like it when I admit I'm wrong or
stupid
if you live for those moments
where I'm wrong or stupid
well take a sip and settle back because
you're going to have one of those
moments where I was wrong and stupid
I rather hastily several days ago
uh told you that there was a study and
that Dr Jordan Peterson had tweeted it
that showed Remarkable Health outcomes
from people who ate just meet you know
sort of the all meat diet
that's a diet that I think is what Dr
Peterson has been on claims great uh
success here's the part where I was
stupid and silly
um it wasn't so much a randomized
controlled trial as it was a thing on
Facebook
[Laughter]
now
in my defense
and it's a very weak defense right so
I'm still all bad but just to give you
some context if I see something tweeted
by Jordan Peterson and it seems to refer
to anything sciency I just sort of
automatically think he's checked it out
like I don't really feel like my
checking it out would add anything to
him checking it out because he would
have a better filter on that stuff but I
think this is a case where uh the
non-scientific study agreed with his his
own experience so let's call it a uh a
number of anecdotal reports that seem to
line up
which is fair
so I mean I don't mind that he tweeted
it I just should have I should have done
a little more a little more digging you
know just one maybe one click would have
been good for me
so let that be a cautionary Tale
sometimes that one extra click will save
you for some some ridiculousness
all right
my favorite topic topic is backwards
causation science
I think this might be like a whole
segment that I do on a regular basis
backwards causation science
all right there's a study that says
night people don't earn as much money as
morning people
they're trying to untangle the causation
I don't know
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that
uh people who tend to be awake during
the work day
might make more money than people who
were asleep during the work day
or even people whose best energy is
during the work day
probably get more done than the people
whose best energy is not during the work
day so I don't know that there's a lot
of mystery to this I feel like the real
thing is some people are night people
and some people are morning people
but do you really need to study why the
morning people make more money
do we need more information about that
where do you where were you were you
sort of on board with that at a time
now I get that if you're a night person
and you're a writer or you work at home
it might work fine
but no there's not much mystery to this
one
let's do another one
um
apparently a good marriage reduces the
rate of psychopathy in the marriage
okay yeah it's the good marriage thing
that makes your mental health better
what would be another way you could look
at this
oh good to be the Psychopaths don't have
good marriages
anybody anybody
I might be on to something there let's
see a normal person marries a psychopath
I think that would all go fine as long
as they start with having a good
marriage it would fix the no this is
ridiculous
that this is what is passing as science
in our world today this is not science
these are ridiculous
all right
there's a study that says uh young
people are far less likely to say they
want to grow up and be parents and have
babies
uh let let's look for all of the all of
the many social reasons for this
all right let's look at all the the
things that are causing this
it's just muddy
hello it's money
Matt may I may I ruin your let's say a
sense of romance about children by
pointing out that for most of human
history children were either an accident
or an economic investment
because you know back before there was
Social Security and stuff like that
retirement packages you pretty much had
to have kids or you were going to be
dead when you're 40.
or you wouldn't be able to defend
yourself you wouldn't be able to collect
enough food you wouldn't be able to farm
so basically children have always been
to make money
now I'm sure people love their children
too
and you know I'm sure people also had
you know feelings about you know just
natural biological urges but mostly
have I ever told you that follow the
money works even when you're sure it
shouldn't
perfect example perfect example if your
romantic mind says people have children
because they're I don't know glorifying
God or
they they're bringing more love into the
world or as Elon Musk says they're
extending the light of human
consciousness sure sure there's that
there's a little that but why is it that
whenever the economics of having
children is bad we just stop it we're
just like well I'm out I'm out you know
if it's going to make me less likely to
retire
amount
I think people are just looking at it
that way so you could spend all day long
looking at all the other reasons but
they would only apply to Elon Musk right
Elon Musk has lots of kids
he's not doing it for the money
doesn't need the money he's actually
doing it because you know the larger you
know higher higher purpose kind of
thinking but plus some biological urges
I'm sure
so he's probably doing it for something
that looks like exactly the right
reasons plus biology but the average
person doesn't have that option
so there's no chance this will change
while the economics are the way they are
do you think there's anything you can
tell people
or teach them
that would make them want to have more
babies when economically it's a disaster
I don't think so I don't think there's
any way to fix that
um why is there a higher rate of kids in
let's say immigrant or recent immigrant
populations
possibly because they're still in the
situation where having children
is a better guarantee that their older
years will be comfortable and they'll
have people around them for support
there's no mystery to any of it it's
just economics Larry Elder is on this of
course saying that you know whatever
happened in you know the Johnson
Administration the grace Society you
change the economics so you could be a
single mother without you know dying of
starvation I guess
so no no mystery there here's one that
might be mystery apparently uh wine
drinking in Europe is plunging
so the European commission looked at the
data and said that wine consumption has
fallen seven percent in Italy 10 in
Spain 15 in France and 22 in Germany 34
in Portugal what in Portugal drinkee is
down 40 34 percent
wow
uh while wine production was going up so
they were making more wine at the same
time demand was plunging
I wonder if there's some kind of meme
that's spreading the world that's
reducing the amount hmm
alcohol is poison
is it a weird coincidence that whenever
I tell you I'm going to make something
happen
it happens globally how is that possible
am I am I just guessing right
I mean I I'm not taking any I'm not
going to take any credit for you know
wine consumption in Europe obviously had
nothing to do with that but no I'm
saying I had nothing to do with it so
before before you mock me wait till the
end of the sentence
there's no way that I'm affecting wine
consumption in Europe let's be honest
about that but
um
how do I keep guessing right
I mean I feel like I end up accidentally
on the right side of stuff
I don't know how that happens really I
mean it just feels like a weird
coincidence again so who knows it could
be just that again follow the follow the
money by might be the entire explanation
they might just feel that there's a
bench and there's gotten back it might
be marijuana it might be just greater
understanding of Health consequences was
it 10 years ago that we all believed
that drinking every day as long as it
was moderate was actually good for you
do you remember that one of the first
big things I debunked before I was doing
it publicly as much you know debunking
for 20 I don't know 30 years I've been
debunking that alcohol is good for you
in small amounts but now the science is
quite
has quite dramatically turned right so
wouldn't you say that the science is
saying that it's not good for you maybe
maybe that's having an effect
all right
uh here's an update on a technique I've
been using with great success and I
recommend it
you've heard of luxury beliefs right
luxury beliefs it's the idea that say uh
bragging that you recycle
is a luxury belief Michael Schellenberg
says that the worst thing you can do for
the planet is recycle your plastic
because they don't actually recycle it
they throw it in the ocean in Thailand
or someplace and basically basically
it's a whole scam the whole plastic
recycling thing isn't even real it never
has been it's never been real
just one more thing that you thought was
real That Never Was
but anyway there are such things as
luxury beliefs and they're much like
especially for women
uh let me go full Sexes here
um I'll make an analogy
if you if you're let's say a reasonably
good-looking guy and you think you've
got some value
and you're going to date a woman
and she's maybe about equal to you and
you pull up in a embarrassing automobile
what is that woman's opinion if you
immediately go to even if otherwise
you're just great you know your income
is fine everything's fine but your car
is a little embarrassing yeah that so
that's that that's a necessary
long ago I realized that at least
heterosexual women
um treat the man's automobile as their
accessory very much like their earrings
very much like their purse very much
like their clothing right it's something
they're associated with in a style sense
so if you know if they don't want to be
associated with your automobile you're
going to have some problems and by the
way I've had that exact problem you know
if my 20 side of the car that was called
the Bondo car because like the paint was
all coming off and that you use it you
use like a quart of oil every time I
drove it because it just left a stream
of oil on the street yeah it was just a
disaster and let's just say I wasn't
doing too well
in the in the lady slaying category not
with that car
anyway so the general idea that women in
particular
see the things that are associated with
them as accessories
men could be a little bit more let's say
resistant to stuff you're resistant to
style especially men can often say you
know forget your style I'm just going to
go for a function and you know you can
have an opinion about that I'm just
saying it happens
and so extend that into beliefs the
luxury of beliefs
people want the same way that you want
an automobile or your jewelry or your
purse to be a good representation of who
you are or what you want to protect your
beliefs
become also an accessory
so if you've got a good belief like
climate change you know that would be a
a luxury belief independence of what's
true or not that's not the argument but
if you say you're on that side that
would be the good accessory that's that
makes you look good
uh there are a number of number of uh
issues like that
but
I found that there's a technique I use
that will ruin people's accessory
and make them stop arguing in any way
that bothers you they might still keep
chattering but it will stop bothering
you immediately
and it goes like this
I'm sorry your news sources have done
this to you
it's total killer
because if you take somebody's accessory
their luxury belief and you reframe it
as a victim story oh I'm sorry that they
did this to you that's a that's a bad
look
it's a bad look
I'm sorry they did it to you
there's nothing wrong with you you're
good
I have no complaint with you you were a
victim of something very powerful and I
wish I wish you the best if there's a
way that I could help you recover from
it I'd like to do that now who wants
that as their accessory
oh I'm sorry that you believe that if I
could help you I would
you immediately get on a combat level so
on on X this happens a lot you know I'll
tweet something and then some weird
luxury belief person often a woman will
will come in and say blah blah blah you
know everything you say is untrue
because they haven't been exposed to
anything like actual news they've just
been victims and I actually don't see
them anymore as my
combatants
I used to I used to frame internet uh
you know arguments as combatants
but sometimes they are like sometimes
you actually have a real disagreement
and maybe that is a combatant situation
somewhat
but mostly
98 of the time
the people who come at me are coming at
me with wrong information because
they've been poisoned by their news
sources and I'm not saying you know I'm
the one who has all the answers but it's
really easy to tell when somebody
doesn't right it's hard to know who has
the right answers
but it's really really easy to know who
has one that's completely wrong
because you've seen more contacts than
they have right if you've seen more
context you're not wondering if they're
wrong
because you've seen more than they have
at the very least they should say they
recognize the context and maybe they
don't agree with something but if they
don't have never never seen the context
they're just victims
so think of this instead of framing your
combatant as somebody who's an enemy you
must defeat
treat them immediately as somebody you
have sympathy for and you'd be happy to
help if there's something that they
don't understand
Watch What Happens
you can actually make them hate their
own luxury belief
try it you'll like it
all right here's a clarification because
I believe that we whities have insulted
our black American citizens
uh and I would like to clarify
now this is not me personally I I
personally have not made this mistake
but I've seen a number of people do this
and by the way I don't think it was
exactly a mistake so much as could have
been clearer all right
so this is a could have been a clearer
situation no but nobody's really the bad
guy this is just something that could
have been cleared
I saw both uh Adam Coleman and Jeff
Charles make the same comment now both
of them are black and they both said
that in I'm paraphrasing but basically
they pointed out that it's a little
sketchy
these are my words a little sketchy that
conservatives are saying
that that Trump might get the black vote
because he got arrested and might get in
jail
and you know two voices that I would
respect both Adam Coleman and Jeff
Charles both smart people
uh decided wait a minute wait a minute
are you saying the black people are
going to vote for them because they're
all criminals
is that what you're suggesting
that you get the black vote by being a
criminal are you really saying that
and the answer is no nobody is saying
that
clarification it's not the jail part
it's the falsely accused part
it's the falsely accused part that
that's the point people are making
nobody's saying they're going to jail
makes you get the black vote
don't hear that nobody's saying that
literally nobody is saying that they're
saying it's a falsely accused part that
if there's any if there's anything that
anybody could relate to it's the falsely
accused
anyway so apology
for anybody who have heard that
differently because we could be a little
bit more clear about that so just a
recommendation
if you're going to press that point and
I think it's actually worth pressing
because I do think the falsely accused
thing might might actually strike a
blood or strike a chord but make sure
you're talking about the falsely accused
word all right
uh I remind you that it masks are
threatening to make a comeback we're
still looking for the first Fortune 500
company
to require masks so we can attack them
quickly and put them out of business
now the first one has to be hard the
problem will be if there's a whole bunch
that go at the same time because the
government told them to do it at the
same time that could be a problem
but it but if somebody makes the mistake
of being in the news first
you have to hit them as hard as you can
with consumer action you know just just
stop buying for as long as you need to
if you can now we did see like Kaiser
Healthcare is masking their employees
but they clarified that did not include
customers
now but they're also not exactly a
for-profit entity it's more like a
member run situation so that's not
really the great boycott situation and I
said Lion's gay had just like one floor
of one office because they had an
outbreak there this is just too trivial
but if somebody goes big
like an actual Fortune 500 and they say
we've decided that for the good of the
nation we're all going to be masks and
all of our customers too you got to take
them out of business right away like
actually just demolish them because
otherwise you're going to wear masks for
the rest of your freaking life so you're
gonna have to go hard
all right
um
Tick Tock one
so I hate to admit defeat but for
several years I've been trying to
recommend that Tick Tock would be banned
and I got a lot of support a lot of
voices on the same side
saying that Tic Tac is a mass
brainwashing device it's so powerful and
destructive that the country that makes
it
China
won't allow it in their own country
because it would be too dangerous for
their children
but they're happy to give it to us and
of course Tick Tock may be the reason
that people are uh
confused about their gender not just one
reason but it might be a big part of
that
and probably a lot of other
anti-American stuff yesterday I turned
on Fox News and apparently they are
accepting advertising from tick tock and
they had this commercial about a veteran
who used Tick Tock to get money so that
his life was not sad and pathetic
because he was a disabled veteran and
elderly
so Fox News is gone
I did a Google Search and Fox News has
been anti-tick-tock really strongly for
all of this year
right if you look at the stories it'll
be Fox News tick tock's bad band Tick
Tock band so now watch what happens to
the coverage after yesterday
do you think Fox News is going to go
hard at their Advertiser
do you know what personality on Fox News
was probably I think the strongest
anti-tick-tock person who is the
strongest anti-tick dock person
Tucker Carlson
Tucker to Carlson he was the strongest
anti-tick-tock person
so
um
in my opinion the only the only
possibility for tick tock to be banned
was if Republicans got enough control to
do it
if Fox News is taking advertising from
Tick Tock you're not going to see
I don't think I don't think you'll see
much in the way of any pushback on Tick
Tock because it would be bad for a
business
at least it's transparent I mean it's
not like the commercial is hidden it's
actually featured so you don't have to
wonder
what that might do to coverage have I
ever told you that follow the money
works every time
now
in my opinion there are no hosts or
opinion people who have been instructed
to change the story
right can you imagine I don't think that
there was like a meeting that would be
very unusual I don't think that anybody
said all right tick tock is our new
sponsor so don't say bad things about
Tick Tock anymore I don't think that
happened that that doesn't strike me as
something that happens in the real world
but rather
everybody knows that if the money's
coming from a spigot you don't turn it
off it's just natural
it's just natural
all right
so uh I lost I lost on The Tick Tock
thing it's it's over Tick Tock staying
and we are now being essentially managed
at least the the youth are being managed
by China
I I'm seeing something in the comments
that I'm pretty sure is not true
all right
um
here's a couple things that uh I've
tried to teach you
and one of them is actually in my brand
new book bestseller best thing you've
ever seen reframe your brain out now in
softcover audiobook
narrated by somebody else uh and uh and
Kendall
so let me give you an example of one of
the reframes from the book and then I'm
going to show it to you in action all
right so I don't get to do this too much
but here you get to see one in the wild
the way it was correctly used
all right the reframe is this
uh the person with the best idea is in
charge
you know how normally you think that
your boss is in charge
or your president or your leaders right
you think they're the ones in charge but
if you had the best idea it was kind of
obvious your idea would get implemented
no matter who was in charge
so you should stop seeing yourself as
not in charge you're always in charge
all right I've lived my whole life this
way when I walk into any situation no
matter what my role is you know just
visiting customer you know just
observing critic anything no matter what
my role is I say I'm in charge
and what I mean by in charge is I don't
mean I must be the boss and get the
credit
I mean that I can influence the outcome
but
only if I have the best idea would I
want to influence the outcome if I
didn't
no no if I didn't think I had a good
idea then or at least you know the
potential for a good idea I would stay
out of it
so I live my life thinking that every
every environment I walk into I'm
effectively in charge in two different
ways
one is you make people feel the way they
feel because of the way you present
yourself
right if you come into a room all happy
with high energy you could raise
People's Energy if you come in all
complaining you can bring them down
right you could cause people to be what
you want
and you can be in charge by having the
best idea
so those are two reframes that I carry
with me all the time
so when I walk into an environment I
walk in confident because I can make the
people do anything I want
by extension of my own behavior
and I can get anything done that I want
if it's a good idea
if it's not a good idea it doesn't get
done now the opposite would be the tick
tock situation that's so clearly a good
idea about you know money money has
apparently ruined that opportunity
so here's here's the real world example
of that yesterday
I tweeted in or asked in frustration
that I've endorsed Vivek ramaswamy but
every time I tweet about him the
comments are full of people who have a
variety of rumors or accusations which
to my ears sound all completely like
but I don't know exactly what the back
story is I don't know what he said about
it you know I don't I don't know the
details and so I always felt exposed
supporting somebody who I couldn't
really respond to a number of vague
rumors
and so I somewhat exasperatingly
suggested on Twitter and also I think on
Livestream that Vivek and Trump has the
same problem too Vivek should create a
page just a web page in which the half
dozen rumors are there and then you've
got one link that every time somebody
brings it up I'll just say well why
don't you look at his explanation see if
you still feel the same
now is that a good idea
you tell me is that a good idea that
there's just one Link in one place that
every criticism about him the ones that
aren't real they're just in one place
so I say that on Twitter
about an hour after I say it I get
contacted by vivek's
his campaign team
and they say oh we heard we heard your
idea we'll have that up on Monday
see what I mean
now that idea is just unambiguously a
good idea
so am I am I in charge of the ramaswami
campaign no of course not the people who
are in charge of it are in charge well
he's in charge
but did I have the ability to change
something
with no power I have no power right no
organizational power but the best idea
just wins
and I think you've seen that a number of
times I mean it's not the first time
you've seen something of this nature but
keep this in mind if you've got a good
idea you are in charge
you just have to communicate it make
sure that the right people hear it and
make sure that there's not a money
interest in the other direction that's
the other problem
all right
I would also like to give you this
this little reframe tip
if you're trying to figure out what kind
of a product is going to be successful
let's say you're trying to do a startup
or maybe even looking to invest
uh this is one of the most reliable
indicators of a product that's going to
be big in the future
if people take the product the way it is
it is kind of crappy it's not really
good yet but they like it in its bad
form that's a really good symbol
um but that's not the one I'm talking
about there's a second one the second
one is people take your product and
extend it
in other words they start with your
product and they add something to it
and I noticed that there are now four
fake books of my book online two of them
are from I think the old publisher so if
the if the thing you think you order
doesn't look like this you did not order
my book but Amazon did take your money
right they did take your money but no
book will be coming to you unless it
looked like this it's the only real one
so there's a purple one that's not real
there's one that's just text and no
picture that's not real but a lot of
people have bought it I don't know where
their money went they can get it back by
canceling because there's there's no
shipping taking place but here's but
that's not this is not to my point those
those two were just bad links
but within hours of the soft cover being
published there are already two rip-off
books
called workbooks so they just take my
book
the content from my book they cut out
with some of the you know this
backstories and stuff which are
essential to to it being a good book uh
and they and they try to make their own
book instantly that they call a workbook
but but I already reported them for
copyright violation
but apparently I can't do that unless I
find the same text which of course has
because it's a book of reframes I mean
just just
consider the fact
that in the back of my own book
is my own workbook kind of summary I
mean I have all the reframes in summary
form
and a reframe by its nature is a summary
what exactly is the summary of my
summary
right yeah the whole the whole thing
that makes us a a useful book is that
each of the reframes is very tightly
explained
if they summarized it more than that
it's useless because it is a summary
and if they didn't summarize it more
than that it's just a copyright
violation
but somebody's tried to turn it into a
different form now
if if what you think is happening is uh
I'm complaining about it it's a little
bit of complaining
it's a little bit of complaining but
there's a larger Point here when
somebody tries to rip you off
immediately
uh that is such a good sign of what's to
come because nobody rips off something
that nobody wants
right so on day one somebody said oh
shoot this is going to be big and they
ripped it off as soon as possible I
don't know how much of my money they're
getting some
apparently I have to buy one in order to
get them taken off because I have to get
their taxed and give the you know the
exact
and then how am I going to do that
retype it I think I'd have to like
retype a chapter
because I can't I can't cut and paste
from Kindle can I I don't know so I've
got this whole problem I have to solve
that's none you know none of you are
concerned
but always look for somebody taking your
product and trying to steal it right
away that's going to be it
it's pretty guaranteed all right
uh Wall Street Journal is starting to
wonder if the uh
if the accident on the Wagner pagosians
plane they're starting to think there
might be something not quite right about
this
they're suspecting it might be
some kind of bad action by Putin or
somebody
I know what do you think is that
possible
well I'm glad they're I'm glad they're
catching up to the obvious
we don't care do you care if it was
blown up with a bomb or it was shot out
of the air how in the world does that
make a difference
I mean really is that different I don't
think so
uh Fox News had an exclusive with that
uh prosecutor that Joe Biden had fired
from Ukraine his name is shoken
now
here's my take on that shokun guy
so so the the two versions of reality on
the left and the right are as follows
on the right
Joe Biden fired the prosecutor because
he was going after barisma hard
and Hunter was on the board so Hunter
got his father to take the heat off of
the company that he was on the board of
so that's the rights version so that
would be consistent with what shokin
says which is oh yeah he was a good guy
he was totally investigating them and
then he was removed because he was
investigating him not because he wasn't
now on the left I'll give you the
Jessica tarlive take on it
removing him had to be legitimate
because there were so many other
International organizations who wanted
him gone
there there were a number of them
internationally so that would prove it's
not about just barisma it's not about
Hunter that proves that you know other
nations and entities International
entities we're all on the same side
may I teach you a new way to spot
in 2023
when Democrats tell you everybody's on
one side or 97 are on one side ninety
percent seven percent of the experts or
or everybody we asked about it in the
geopolitical field
that's always a lie
do you know why
they would just tell you the reasons
if they had reasons
they wouldn't tell you that other people
say there's reasons they just tell you
the reasons
it would have nothing to do with other
people's opinion if it were real
do you need other people's opinion about
gravity
we're trying to convince you that
gravity exists
but you know the reason you should
believe it is 97 percent of experts say
gravity is real
you you don't need experts for something
that can be demonstrated with arguments
or data now granted you might not be
able to look at a scientific study and
you know know how true it is but
wouldn't you understand the basic idea
if the climate change people come to you
and say we measured the temperature of
Earth
and you're not a scientist when you have
a question like just a natural ordinary
person question how do you measure how
do you measure the temperature of the
Earth
they'd say well we have these
thermometers you know in the ocean at
various places and I would say you have
thermometers like the same kind of
thermometers everywhere like the whole
Earth
and they say no no we don't need the
whole Earth
we you know we put them in places we can
get to easily and yeah we try to cover
as much as we can but not not like the
whole earth or anything but you know
good scientific average and I say so it
wouldn't be true that
the the heat sometimes moves through
different areas of the Earth but stays
the same in other words you couldn't
have extended years
where there's a portion of the earth
that gets warmer while another portion
is getting cooler and then if you just
wait
you know it evens out over time is it is
that possible well so if you were just a
person who is not an expert would you
have a lot of questions about it
and then you'd say what about those
climate change models are the models
science or are they something adjacent
to science
they're adjacent to science there's
something scientists do they're not
science and if anybody tells you that
they're science they're lying
they might be useful and they're done by
scientists but what assumptions they put
into them and which ones Survive by luck
after they throw the ones that had bad
luck and didn't match you know the
today's temperature
looks sketchy as hell
that's not to say there isn't a problem
that I don't know
I mean I'm not not smart enough to know
but I'm pretty sure nobody else knows
either
that's my take I don't know I don't know
how much danger there is but I'm pretty
sure nobody else knows that part I'm
sure about
so whenever you see all the experts on
one side that's almost a guarantee of
fakeness
um remember I told you about the alcohol
being good for you in small amounts
what percentage of experts do you think
agreed with that until they found out it
was complete um 97 probably do
you remember the uh food pyramid that
was complete what percentage of
dietitians and experts believe for years
that that was
yeah about 100 you know not a hundred
but maybe 95 percent right
so
do you do you see the pattern
the 97 argument exists when it's
 usually as soon as somebody
says most people agree your reaction
should be oh what are they hiding
because it turns out you can get all the
experts to agree easily
do you know who the easiest people to
fool are
so I'm speaking here as a hypnotist
the easiest people to fool are academics
and scientists do you know why
because they believe Dana
so you just tell them there's some data
and they'll be like all right I love my
data you just tell them that 97 of
scientists agree
you want you want to get the other yeah
there's a new scientist comes on you go
all right 97 of scientists agree
so maybe you should too if you want to
give some money
um
and uh last thing I want to say about
shoken is I I guess I guess all of that
sort of suggested to you that shokun was
telling the truth that was an accident
on my part what I was trying to do is
show both sides in my opinion shokun
looks like the biggest liar I've ever
seen in my life and has anybody
mentioned that he's Ukrainian
so he might be the biggest liar in the
country that's famous for being the
biggest lying country and corrupt
there's nothing he said that sounds
credible to me he just looks like he's
lying
on the other hand the the opposite
argument
relies on the everybody's head which I
believe is also a signal for lying so in
my opinion you've got two sides that are
lying I think they're both wrong
I think whatever the truth is is
probably not either of those things I
mean it must be true that he's either
corrupt or not but there's something
wrong with both stories they both have
the lowest level of credibility one's a
fired Ukrainian guy
even even if it were America if you talk
to the guy who got fired and he's
talking about his old company
come on who believes the Fired Guy
nobody should believe the fire guy even
if they're right their their credibility
is the lowest they could be
so we have nothing to believe on that
story really
um I have no idea which it is I don't
have any idea but can you give me a fact
check
wasn't there a hunter or a hunter
Associates email
the suggested that that barisma really
did want him gone isn't it in writing
give me a fact Jack on that am I
imagining that because I might be
imagining it
does anybody remember I swear to God I
I'm seeing some yeses trickling in but I
I was sure there was a story where it's
documented that Hunter and Verismo
wanted shoken gone
I thought that was documented
then that would have been the response
to Jessica Tarlov but I didn't see
anybody give that response
so sort of a Jesse Waters thing he needs
to get on that
all right
um do you know what Rico is
so Rico is the law that they used to go
after the mafia
and I guess the idea was if if they're
organized and they're organized for a
common criminal purpose that would be
something you could use the Rico laws
which give you I guess a little more a
little more of a hammer to go after
people
so
so the the general you know
situation for saying something's a RICO
situation is if it's organized and
Criminal
so I sent this tweet yesterday see what
you say I said I'm no lawyer but the
entire Democratic Leadership looks like
a criminal conspiracy to me from the
Russia collusion hoax to the laptop hoax
to the January 6 Insurrection hoax to
the fine folks hoax to the Ukraine
Ukraine and Hunter to the Department of
Justice and therefore
indictments to the media puppets
Now isn't the only thing that would make
that not Rico is if they hadn't
coordinated right if none of them had
coordinated and they just sort of
independently decided what they're doing
well it's not Rico that's just people
who see something to be in their
interest and act in a coordinated way I
would say Republicans are like that
Republicans act as similarly you know
after the after a new issue comes up
they end up acting similarly
but I never see coordination
have you
I mean it seems like Republicans read
the news and they're influenced by the
news like everybody is
and then they make their opinions but it
seems like it's just that it's just I
watched the news I formed an opinion if
I didn't watch enough news maybe my
opinion's not good but that's the whole
story
there's news
and then people and social media and
then people make opinions
correct me if I'm wrong but the Russia
collusion hoax was a
multi-entity coordinated up
the laptop hoax was a multi-entity
coordinated up
the j6 you know Insurrection
was a multi-entity
coordinated up you had the politicians
you had the media that I'm sure they
talk to do you think that nobody talked
to the media and said here's the message
we're going to be putting out maybe they
didn't need to because they're so
obvious in what the right message was
but what about here's here's the thing
that that finally tripped me
there are four prosecutors
and four indictments against Trump
can you confirm because I saw some
disagreement on that are all four
Democrats the prosecutors or is there
some question about that
I did a fact check on that
I'm saying cbs's but let's uh I'm gonna
that's my operating assumption right now
here's a big question
we did hear that at least one of the uh
indictments
was a result of somebody in the
Democratic Party
possibly rumored to have contacted the
prosecutor to say this is the timing to
do it if you do it now it's the best
timing for our cause
now
um
what about the other three
here's what it would take to prove Rico
in my opinion if you could find that
anybody in the Democrat Party had
contacted any of these prosecutors
any of them
that would be a coordinated criminal
activity
and I was criminal because the charges
are obviously the reason
anybody thinks the charges are true is
because the media is part of the
coordinated op
the media told people that he said find
some votes in his best gangster way the
truth of course is that if you saw the
whole context he's saying he thinks the
election was not legitimate and a closer
look would prove him to be right that's
all that happened January 6. why does
anybody think that was an insurrection
because the media told them do you think
the media operated independently to call
it an Insurrection or do you think that
they talk to anybody in the Democrat
Party who said you know we're going to
go with this being an Insurrection this
will be good for us of course they
talked about it
so what standard do you need to meet is
it because there's no money being made
well it's all money
it's all money you got you know the
Democrats you may be supported by the
military-industrial complex that's all
money
there might be people who think that
they will lose their jobs if they don't
you know make sure there's a Democrat
leadership that's money that's jobs
uh the uh Hunter and uh
and his dad and his Partners they were
making money from Ukraine
there are rumors that other major
politicians who shall not be named may
be involved in exactly the same kind of
dirty business which might be illegal I
don't know if it's legal or illegal but
they might be involved in similar
sketchy things that the public wouldn't
like if they heard about it
what part of this
is not a criminal Enterprise that's
coordinated
to me it looks like a coordinated
criminal Enterprise trying to Jail the
opposition Trump so that they can have
better jobs and careers and continue
making money you know in their Fair
violating ways
so you got your money you got your
massive coordination which I think could
be demonstrated pretty easily I mean if
you check if there was if you had a
let's say legal Authority
um to check all the phone records of the
prosecutors you don't think you'd find
that they were talking to Democrat
leaderships do you think that any of
these prosecutors are lined up for a
promotion when they're done do you think
any of them already have promises of a
better job or already have promises of
funding for anything they run for
do you think there was any quid pro quo
at all it's just a coincidence that four
prosecutors who might be looking to
improve their situation all have these
 charges at the same time
now you might say to yourself us God is
just politics it's just Politics the
Republicans they're no different really
what what was the last full
multi-department op brainwashing up that
the Republicans did
I don't think they do I mean I would
have noticed wouldn't I I'm in a pretty
deeply embedded I think I would have
noticed
and certainly if I saw it happening I
wouldn't be happy about it like if you
think I would if you think I'd be in
favor of brainwashing up because it came
from one side versus the other you'd be
very very wrong
brainwashing up
no bueno wouldn't support it coming from
anybody for anything
well the school is brainwashing up if
you do it right that would be a that
would be different yeah if you'd have to
go back to the Iraq War
to find Republicans but I think the
Republicans actually were somewhat
fooled as well
by the bad Intel yeah I'll I'll give you
the Iraq War I'll give you that but that
was a long time ago
that was a long time ago
so I think there is a RICO case to be
made
um for at least the leadership of the
Democrat Party and the media and the
prosecutors and George Soros and and the
Soros money
you don't think that's all connected
if you see like you know Soros Jr
meeting with the very Democrats who
benefit from all this and he's funding
the prosecutors in some cases I suppose
so he's supporting prosecutors and
having meetings with them that we can
see because they're public
what would it take to make that Rico
is there any can I hear from the lawyers
I know there are always some lawyers
here now I don't think there's any like
realistic chance that something will
happen but but isn't this meeting all of
the requirements of a RICO prosecution
anybody who's an actual lawyer if you'd
like to identify yourself I I saw only
one or two people who are lawyers
agreeing with me earlier
come on you can you can give me an
opinion
yeah it is true the first Iraq war was
um nearly unanimous
not unanimous no I guess but I think
I think even
um
Al Gore voted in favor of the first Iraq
War
all right well you're kind of quiet on
this
so I guess I would be two Pie in the Sky
hoping for it all right in other news uh
only fans reportedly has 238 million
paying users
so uh
follow the money
will the reproduction rate
go up or down
Oli fans I hate to say it but only fans
is what men are using as a substitute
for human women
or women in person
238 million users and they've had one
billion dollars in Revenue
follow the money there's no way that
that reproduction is going to be the
winning economic model this is the
winning economic model
every one of those women who made like a
good living just said to them I don't
need a husband
why do I need a husband
if he doesn't make as much money as I do
I'm just basically paying a guy I can
get a guy anytime I want why would I pay
one
so but a lot of them are single
obviously
all right CNN is setting us up for the
next wave of uh major or at
least it looks that way here's what they
say U.S intelligence agencies the people
they collude with in a RICO sense
allegedly
um the U.S intelligence agencies believe
do they really that the Russian
Federation Security Services is
attempting to influence public policy
and public opinion in the west by
directing Russian civilians to build
relationships with influential U.S and
Western individuals
and then disseminate the narratives
so they're sending out Russians
to befriend influential people
influential people
influential
well it would be like an influential
person
so it doesn't sound like they're talking
about politicians
it sounds like they're talking about
me
doesn't it
doesn't that sound like me
now let me ask you this
have I ever had a conversation a
friendly conversation with the Russian
I don't know maybe
maybe
is anybody that I regularly talk to
about politics you know privately are
any of them Russian and I don't know it
Maybe
Maybe
possibly
do you do you see the danger here do you
see the foreshadowing I think Mike
cernovich pointed it out they're
creating a way if you if you buy into
the narrative
they're creating a McCarthy situation
where people like me can be removed from
the public conversation if I ever talk
to a Russian citizen
they're going to say oh you talk to a
Russian citizen so now we can check all
of your Communications
right if I ever had that conversation
with a Russian citizen even if I didn't
know it maybe I just dm'd him or
something
do you think that they could then say
well uh this person is talking to a
Russian agent Maybe
we don't know but you know Russian
citizen Russian agent maybe same thing
so now I've got a suspicion about this
person that's being influenced well we
better find out if they're like a
totally owned Russian puppet or not huh
we better check all their Communications
whoops we didn't find any Russian spy
stuff but my God look at this other
we better put him in jail right away
you see what's happening right I don't
think this could be more obvious
it's a setup
to take people off the court off the
board
wait wait for the first one
how long will it take before somebody
you know
is accused of talking to a Russian
and then all of their communication was
up up for uh exposure
and then they got him for something else
it's like oh nothing about the Russian
thing so look at all this bad stuff here
yeah
this is the scariest
thing you'll ever see
now is it possible that it's just a
story and they're just telling us yeah
it's possible
but it's kind of convenient isn't it
that it looks like exactly right on the
nose for what you would do if you were
trying to set up a situation for
to me this looks like glaring I
mean it couldn't be glaring any harder
all right
um or as uh cerno calls it the new j6
trap right so watch out for you know not
just this but watch out for new traps
so the idea would be if you can get a
bunch of Republicans to even support
verbally any conservatives who do bad
things because they get all worked up
because of the news and because of trump
being jailed perhaps that it's just
going to be another January 6th thing
where they can prove that all of the all
Republicans or white supremacists
because they trying to get this white
supremacist out of jail if that's what
happens and they will just turn it into
a thing they can jail anybody who's on
the other side
is Russia selling uranium to the USA I
don't know I haven't heard anybody
complaining about a shortage for uranium
um the dumbest story let me say this
again remember the story about uh
there was a Canadian uranium company in
the U.S I think that sold their company
to a Russian entity
and and then everybody said no if we
need this if we need this valuable
resource
we can't have the Russians own it
and that I laughed at them and said
it's in the United States
the mine is in the United States
if we need it
we just take it
who's not understanding how anything
works
what what's the difference what the
corporate entity says on the piece of
paper if it's a national emergency and
we need the uranium because let's say
Americans are dying because they don't
have enough for medical use we just say
all right well we're going to take all
your uranium
what do you think we're just going to
let them ship it up and ship it off to
other countries while we have a national
emergency
that's not going to happen not in any
world could that happen
yeah we would just take it
that's that's another one of those
situations where you don't know who has
the power
Russia has no power over the uranium
that they own in the United States
you do you own that uranium and if you
want to take it from the Russians
tell your Congress people and if enough
people do we just take it
all right
uh here's the scariest thing you'll hear
in the news Biden when he was asked
about
the Trump mug shot
he gave this smile that is chilling and
said hey he's a handsome guy
laughed about it
he's the president of the United States
and he literally laughed
that his people are jailing the
opposition
right in front of you you just laughed
at it
at the same time now I'm not going to
blame Biden specifically for this
because we know he doesn't run his
social media right no nobody thinks that
Biden is tweeting we know that our
people do it but this is a proof that
Biden doesn't have command of his
faculties
tell me you don't think that Biden would
have fired his social media person
if he had his faculties all right so
here's what his social media person sent
at the same time as the mug shot so it's
the timing that's the important part
apropos of nothing meaning the mug shot
but they're cleverly referring to it
apropos of nothing I think today is a
great day to give to my campaign so it's
a Joe Biden alleged tweet and a big part
of the graphic on there is the
handwritten let's finish the job
so making a direct reference to Trump
being put being arrested
in their own handwriting of one of their
handwriting it says let's finish the job
and they make sure that you know that
it's associated with the arresting of
trump because they say apropos nothing
that's that's your signal that they're
really talking about
just imagine those two things on a tweet
that apropos of nothing a great day to
give to my campaign in other words he's
fundraising over jailing his opposition
is fundraising over jailing his
opposition
and and he says let's finish the job
which in my opinion is a cult of
violence
to me it's a call to violence both sides
let's finish the job says we're gonna
we're gonna rub you out
and it with basically everything we have
and anybody who hears it is going to say
you're going to rub me out I'm going to
rub you out so to me it looks like a
cult of violence a dropping of norms of
American you know presidential treatment
and in my opinion a younger Joe Biden
would have immediately fired the person
who sent the tweet and apologized to the
country
because without the tweet he's he still
gets Trump
you know where he wants them right
so he could still be privately happy
that things are going the way they're
going
but I don't think a Joe Biden with his
faculties would have allowed this tweet
to go out as a fundraiser with such
such provocative language does anybody
think that a younger Joe Biden in
control of his faculties would have
allowed this tweet or not fired the
person who sent it
what do you think
because I you know I don't think he was
always dumb
but at the moment he's just he's
dysfunctional it appears yeah I think I
think what we're seeing is a complete
lack of you know Biden leadership this
is just such a clear example in my
opinion this is Crystal Clear
all right well maybe it's maybe it's
just that the days are different and
something this provocative is no longer
totally ruled out
if you're joining late I don't know if
you know that the best book in the world
that's already changing lives everywhere
is uh
is out
so I've got a bunch of podcasts
lined up I'll tell you more about those
when they're out
and some of them are going to be real
fun and real good
so wait for that
all right uh
it's not well it's number one in this
category yeah number one in this
category
uh you're taking the high road Scott
he's always been a bum no he's always
been a bum but he's never been stupid
not not stupid at that level I mean you
know maybe he wasn't a top of his class
but he was a capable capable politician
he knew what was a bad move and what was
a good move I mean he knew that but he
apparently has lost that ability
all right
uh
all right we have agreement
yeah Fukushima is releasing radioactive
stuff I don't know what to think about
that because I'm not a scientist
uh uh Rico prosecutors well you know I
think that maybe there needs to be some
kind of mutually assured destruction
you know under normal circumstances I
would never ever suggest a RICO
prosecution about a political party
right I would never because I would be
so disruptive
even if I thought maybe there was
something there I think I wouldn't
recommend it but in the situation where
a political person is being potentially
jailed I say under those conditions the
person being jailed can say it looks
like a RICO situation to me you better
hope I'm not president because that's
what it's going to be and you're all
going to jail
I do think that most of the Democrat
leadership uh should be in jail
I mean that not as provocation not as
hyperbole but it's my observation that
it appears to be a criminal Enterprise
at this point I think it's just sort of
drifted into a criminal Enterprise
are are Republicans any better I don't
know I don't know they just don't seem
organized in a RICO sense I I think I
think they may have their own bad apples
of course you know if Tomorrow there's
some Republican who
you know gets accused of something
terrible don't say I didn't tell you you
know don't say I said all the
Republicans are good people that's not a
thing
all right
um
yeah yeah the the worst argument I hear
from the Democrats about
um Trump's indictments this is a Jessica
tarloff Point she says that that Trump
was not indicted by his political
opponents he was indicted by ordinary
Americans who were in a grand jury
do you know what's wrong with that
can somebody give me a fact check
is it true or false
I believe it's true that the defense is
not offered is that true
a grand jury has no defense right
right now it's 2023 and you've seen my
hoax list
the reason that there are so many hoaxes
you know from the fighting people hoax
so they're drinking bleach Oaks to the
j6 Insurrection hoax to the laptop folks
the reason that so many hoaxes can exist
is because
half of the country
only hears the accusations they never
hear the context
that they they believe that Trump mocked
a guy with a disability
they actually believe that's true
now he made that motion but he's been
using that same motion for other people
for years there's a compilation clip of
him doing the same thing for Ted Cruz
now if you didn't know that
so suppose all the things that Democrats
think are true have been presented to
you
without any Counterpoint
do you if you never saw the other side
and somebody just described Trump from a
Democrat perspective how many of you
would say oh my God he's terrible all
these must be true of course you would
if you only hear one side
so again
what is what would be another way to
describe a grand jury
that had decided to indict somebody
it's very much like oh 97 percent of
experts agree uh yeah it's just like
that every time you hear
all the people agreed that we're
supposed to agree that is
right that is if if Jessica
tarloff had said this would be an honest
presentation well uh ordinary citizens
are the ones who decided
but to be fair they only heard one side
of the argument
and what we've seen so far suggests that
the argument's pretty sketchy
that would be fair
I would say that oh yeah okay that's
both sides
but what is the public here the public
hears every single person who heard the
the evidence thinks he's guilty so of
course you have to have a trial that's
what they hear if you did a poll of the
General Public
what percentage of the general public
know
that a grand jury doesn't hear both
sides they only hear the prosecution how
many know that
two percent
tops
oh well maybe everybody who's been in
legal trouble knows it so it's probably
higher than that yeah anybody who's ever
been indicted knows it but the rest of
us don't
I mean I think I found that out
you know well into adulthood
you know it's not something I knew when
I was 25.
but I know it now
yeah
yeah and again the the RICO charges
against Trump
are in my opinion a strong evidence that
the Democrats are Rico organized
situation that that pretty much is that
that pretty much is the the last nail in
the coffin there I would say that's
confirmation I don't have any doubts
that the Democrats are organized in a
RICO criminal fashion I think that's a
given it's just so obvious
but whether that's anything that anybody
would act upon I think it's unlikely
I think they'll just keep consolidating
power
all right
hardcover should be pretty soon yes I've
just got to do one more quality check on
that and then we can push push the
trigger on it
I should get a hard copy of myself today
I think and if I like it you know I want
to make sure everything the production
quality is good and then I'll just just
give it a thumbs up
all right
why do people wait for the hardcover do
people wait for the hardcover because
you think some books are more keep on
the Shelf collectibles
or is it better it was a better gift
for travel you like a hard copy for
travel
put it on the coffee table so I can sign
in feels more valuable all right
you know I just you know the the normal
way that Publishers work is they do the
hard copy first
and then maybe a year later or longer
they'll do the soft cover
I always thought I hated that like as a
producer of books I I felt that was
manipulative
because it seemed better to either make
them all available at the same time
but not to not to take advantage of
somebody's you know interest in a book
to chart to up charge them because it
has a better cover
like that just felt manipulative to me
like I'd never liked that so as soon as
it was an option that we didn't have to
do that we just sort of did things in
the order they were ready and the soft
cover was ready first
um
that made that just made more sense to
me that feels better to the customer but
ideally they would all be available at
the same time all right well it could be
that the book will take off when the
hardcover how many were waiting for the
hardcover
tell me if you were waiting for the
hardcover
some maybe 25 percent
all right good to know all right ladies
and gentlemen I got some more work today
plenty of work
boy have I been working hard lately I've
been working crazy hard I hope it pays
off for you as well as me
um
that's all for now I'll talk to you
tomorrow thanks for joining YouTube
