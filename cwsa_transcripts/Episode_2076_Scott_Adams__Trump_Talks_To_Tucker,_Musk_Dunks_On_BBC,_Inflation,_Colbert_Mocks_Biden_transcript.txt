do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlighted civilization it's the
best thing that's ever going to happen
to you in your whole damn life
and it's lucky that you made it here
some of you for the original some of you
for the recorded version but both
awesome
and if you'd like to maximize this
experience and I know that's the kind of
people you are you do not settle for
ordinary experience when you can have
the good stuff all you need for the good
stuff is uh copper mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea Stein the canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopa being
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now
go
oh yeah that's good
yep The Wizard of Oz
that's right
well
um the funniest thing that happened
yesterday how many of you were lucky
enough to catch these spaces uh audio
event so it's a it's a Twitter feature
where you hear just audio
and Elon Musk
uh had a Twitter spaces event in which
he was having a conversation with the
BBC
let's call it the British Broadcasting
Corporation
let's call it that
um
and it was the most entertaining thing
I've seen in a long time heard so I put
in my earbuds and the here's the fun
part you put in the earbuds and you hear
people just having a conversation it's
like you're in the room
because it's not it wasn't technically
an interview it was molecular
conversation
and when you hear like a a personal live
conversation with Elon Musk just you
know talking to some BBC guy and having
having a lot of fun with it and I'll
tell you how much fun he had he had a
lot of fun with it it was just so
entertaining I know it was better than
the movie better than most scripted
anything really so here's what was good
about it
and I will uh borrow from David sacks uh
tweet in which he summarized the most
interesting part of it
so this is a summary version but it
captures it pretty good BBC why is there
so much more hate speech on Twitter now
Elon Musk can you give me an example
can you give me an example of some of
the Hayes speech you're seeing now
uh
well just one just one example
uh well
people say
people say all sorts of nonsense you
don't know what you're talking about
now this is the uh and then the BBC is
let's move on
[Laughter]
let's move on now this was the
abbreviated version if you heard the
full version
oh my God
you've never heard a reporter get
squashed in a live conversation that
hard
somebody who is uh who knows Media stuff
better
commented that the biggest mistake you
can make would be letting your interview
subject also record the call
but to also do it live
that the reporter was taking a big
chance when he decided to be at a live
event and challenge Elon Musk because if
there's one thing we know about Elon
Musk he doesn't get embarrassed
you don't ever want to be in a live
conversation with somebody who's not
happy with you and also and also this is
important
doesn't get embarrassed by anything
now
here's how here's how it went it wasn't
just that when musk asked him for an
example of the Hayes speech he couldn't
come up with it musk put his boot on
this guy's head and just drilled him in
front of all of us while we listened and
it was so good it was sort of like this
it was like wait a minute you're saying
that you've noticed that the hate speech
is up but you don't have one example
just one example all I'm asking you is
for one just give me one example of
anything you saw that looked like more
hate speech what would be one example
well you know people say
no but can you give me one example
because if it's a big story it's a big
thing and you can see it personally you
could give me one example
couldn't give him one even General
example
and musk just ground him into the dirt
for that it was glorious it was so much
fun to listen to
but it got better
so
this next part you're not even going to
believe
I love the part after this you won't
believe so then musk starts grinding
this guy down for the fake information
that the BBC reported about coven masks
and vaccination side effects
now do you notice the difference
when when Elon Musk made an accusation
about the BBC
he gave them specifics yeah what you
said about masks and what and what you
didn't say about vaccine side effects
that's very specific
and the guy didn't push back at all he
just tried to change the subject oh well
well yes that subject the the
so
after musk has completely just
disemboweled this guy in public
by by showing that his accusation said
no wait whatsoever
but musk's accusations against the BBC
have well proven weight that they were
reporting fake news on the most
important event in our in recent years
then after thoroughly
thoroughly destroying this guy musk
turns to questions from the audience
but the BBC guy was still there
and he kept trying to sort of chime in
while musk was looking through questions
and musk was just basically dismissing
him like he's not even talking
but he he had so so humiliated himself a
BBC hit guy had that that musk reads the
question that makes fun of the fact that
BBC has two meanings
you all know the second meaning right
one is British broadcast Corporation the
other is big black
in case you didn't know I couldn't say
that I probably wouldn't have said that
except that's the story so mosque says
on this on this audio event after he's
just destroyed this guy's reputation
he says to him so do you like the BBC
[Laughter]
he's just tried to get him to quote
something that'll sound funny when he
says it and the guy won't take the bait
he said well you know I think the
interview is over maybe maybe we should
move on and the funniest part is that
musk didn't quit with the BBC stuff I
think he asked him like five or six
times
he is so demolished this guy that
talking about anything serious was
complete waste of time because he just
clowned him completely and then he just
starts forcing this guy to admit that he
likes big black
and the guy doesn't know what to do
because it's not supposed to go that way
it's just not supposed to happen
oh
oh my God
I I fell asleep to that you know
conversation after the BBC the BBC guy
liked
I fell asleep to it and the best part of
it is
uh every time
every time somebody tries to accuse Elon
Musk of having a sophomoric sense of
humor
he just doubles down on it and it just
makes it funnier
every time he doubles down on his eyes
what would you call a pure Isle or
whatever is the word for it a sense of
humor it just gets funnier
and the funny part is that he's he's not
embarrassed by it
that by far that's the funny part that
that he doesn't mind putting it right
out there it's like well well deal with
that now let's see how you do I'm going
to put that out there let's see how you
do in public
oh that was funny
but the other things we learned which I
did not know
is that as you know Twitter staff went
from almost 8 000 people to closer to
1400 to 1500.
and it's still running
and apparently they closed one of three
data centers around the year end and it
was a huge problem apparently they
thought one was redundant but when they
went to close it they realized that
there were a lot of hardwired
connections with the three so it almost
destroyed Twitter but you never heard
about that until until now
so that was actually one of the biggest
problems
for Twitter's future and you never heard
about it they just made it work somehow
uh but the other thing is that he was he
was he was bleeding a few billion
dollars a year
with the old cost structure
and he says he's uh
gotten it down to they should be cash
positive actually making more cash than
they're spending
within the year
now that is pretty impressive
that is pretty impressive
can you believe that it went from wildly
on unprofitable
and of course he bought it for twice as
much as it was probably worth
and he talked about that as well
basically he didn't want to buy it once
he found out what it was really worth
but by then it was too late he'd
committed so he ended up having to buy
it anyway
so he wasn't really crazy about the deal
but he's trying to make it work and he's
actually turned it profitable
in in a few short months he expects it
to be cash positive
now that's amazing
you know as much as Tesla is impressive
as much as SpaceX and and uh neuralink
and all those things and start like as
oppressive as all of those companies are
individually
the fact that he turned around Twitter
in one year
he turned around turned around Twitter
in one year
that's incredible
now he says that
advertisers are coming back
now of course I couldn't get off the
call
because
I was wondering if the BBC guy would
blame me
because you know that's been happening
in the Press lately people have
literally blamed me
for advertisers not coming back to
Twitter like actually just me
[Laughter]
can you imagine waking up into that news
like I one day I woke up into the news
that I had personally destroyed Twitter
because one time musk said something
about Dilbert shouldn't get canceled
and therefore he was agreeing with me
and therefore he must be a racist and
therefore all the advertisers were never
going to come back
that almost was my fault
now
according to musk mostly advertisers
will probably in the long term come back
because it's a good platform
for them to advertise but
that was weird anyway the BBC didn't
mention me
so that felt like progress in my world
yeah
some would say I didn't have anything to
do with it but that doesn't change
anything
all right
I guess one of the uh the groups I just
learned this this morning the BBC
mentioned a group that had talked about
more Hayes speech on Twitter and I guess
that group is the institute for
strategic dialogue
and they said they saw more Haze speech
on but I learned this morning
from a an alert Twitter user
that the same group that says there's
more hay speech they're primarily a
climate change advocacy group and they
don't like that Twitter has anti-climate
alarm stuff on it so it turns out the
least credible organization because they
have a clear bias against musk and
against Twitter's handling of climate
change stuff they're the ones who say
there's more hay speech but I think
they're looking at anti-climate change
stuff as hate speech too
so nothing the BB said BBC guy said was
credible
it was it was just a total dismantling
of of The credibility of the uh The
Entity it was awesome
right uh
so the Democrats in looking at where
they would hold their 2024 convention
they decided that in the entire United
States the place that would make the
most sense for a democratic convention
would be in Chicago
which Joel Pollock and Breitbart
hopefully points out is the murder
capital of the country
they're literally having their
convention in the murder capital of the
country
now
does that not tell you that they don't
care about anything because they must
have the elections rigged already I mean
this feels like a group who isn't trying
to win
just consider that they're seriously
looking to run Joe Biden for president
and they're going to hold their
convention in Chicago
you tell me they're trying to win
they're not trying to win an election
they either have it already rigged so it
doesn't matter what they do
or they stop trying
what's the other possibility
I don't see another possibility it's
either already rigged
or they just stop trying to win and the
stop trying to win wouldn't make any
sense at all
so I'm going to use my
technique which I've recommended now
my working assumption is that they
believe they've already figured out how
to rig the upcoming election
I don't have evidence for that I have no
no facts to back it up
I have only an observation of something
that can't be explained another way
you cannot explain this level of
incompetence in the Democrat Party
unless they know it doesn't matter
unless they know it doesn't matter and I
think they know it doesn't matter I also
think that the real reason that they
want Trump to run
I think I'll be the first person I've
heard say this
the real reason they want Trump to run
is not because they think they can beat
him with Biden
it's because they won't believe Trump
when he says it was rigged
boom
that's why
because he's the only person they can
rig the election right in front of him
and right in front of you and it won't
matter
because you're not going to listen to
Trump saying an election is rigged again
you won't listen a second time
but imagine for a moment uh Mitt Romney
ran for president again as a Republican
and imagine for a moment just
hypothetically if Mitt Romney said wait
a minute this doesn't look right I don't
believe this election was rigged was was
proper
if Mitt Romney tells you that the
election was rigged the Democrats have a
big problem
because people are going to think uh
Mitt Romney doesn't exactly just always
agree with the Republicans
he would actually have to actually
literally believe this must be true
or he wouldn't say it
you know that's sort of impression you
have now you can imagine a bunch of
other Republicans that you would put in
the same boat
if Tom Cotton ran for president
and he didn't like the result of the
election and genuinely thought he was
rigged
you'd believe him
because he doesn't have any history that
would suggest he would lie about such a
thing of that importance
um if uh
and you can name I'll bet you could name
five other Republicans Chris Christie
take Chris Christie if Chris Christie
ran for president
lost but thought the election was rigged
genuinely thought it you'd believe him
you would believe him there's only one
person who could claim the election is
rigged and you wouldn't want to
necessarily back him because you're
going to get in trouble and get thrown
in jail and lose your job
and that's Trump
Trump is the only person they can cheat
right in front of you
everybody else they would have to be way
more clever and I don't know if they
know how to be way more clever
so let me be clear I have no evidence of
anything being rigged no evidence none
zero
however
the Democrats are sending a signal
that they're not trying to compete under
normal circumstances it looks like they
have something else
going on
something else
whatever it is yeah let's let's take a
Vivek as another example Vivek ramaswamy
If he if he lost the election but
legitimately claimed it looked like
there were irregularities
you would believe him
why because he's gotten this far and he
didn't tell you any lies right so why
would this be the first one it would be
weird for that to be the first one
but Trump's a different animal you know
Trump plays fast and loose with the fact
jacking always has so if you put him in
the office again you make him lose again
the one thing you can guarantee isn't
going to happen
is an Insurrection at the Capitol
you know why
because they put you in jail for
protesting because it's not really a
free country the way it used to be and
honestly it's not it's not a free
country the way it used to be
so that's that that's my hypothesis my
hypothesis
is my my working understanding without
evidence without evidence but my working
assumption is that everything is leading
in One Direction
which is they plan to cheat they know
they can do it and Trump is the only
person you won't believe when he says it
happened
that's what it looks like
well more to that point but indirectly
even Colbert has mocked the president's
cognitive ability
yes this really happened
so you may have seen the interview where
Biden was talking to Al Roker
and Al Roker is not what you would call
the hard-hitting interviewer right he's
there for the Easter egg hunt and the
weather and fun stuff
and so Al Roker does this you know
softball kind of Hey Joe how many more
Easter egg hunts do you think you'll
have you know trying to figure out if
he's really running
and then
and then uh I'm sorry Biden and then
Biden
trips over his words it is Biden way and
it becomes another viral thing and more
evidence why they don't want to let him
talk in public if they can avoid it
and here's what Colbert did so after
they showed the video Colbert comes back
and he's wearing aviator glasses like
Biden and he does his Joe Biden
impression and I'm going to do my
impression
of Colbert's impression
so that you can get a sense of how much
he was mocking him because I've never
heard Colbert go this hard even in a
funny way I've never heard him go this
hard at Biden so he goes he says uh
that's right Jack I got big Easter news
Joe Biden can lay eggs easy as pie no I
push him right out of my cloaca I don't
know what that is must be a body part or
something serve him up scrambled or sit
on him for a while also a beautiful
flock a little baby Joe's peep
Colbert equipped and then he goes on uh
point is I am mentally fit once again to
run for president of the United States
what's going on where's Jill Marco jillo
so even Colbert
use this example
as someone who is demonstrating to the
world that he's not mentally fit to be
president
he just put it right out there
now
what does that tell you
it's hard for me to imagine
that the Democrats actually expect Biden
to be the nominee
do you think they're desperately trying
to find a replacement and they just
can't get one yet
now how many of you saw Newsome
he's doing some kind of national tour
and
I've never liked him less
than his interview that I just saw when
he was this is Newsome I'm talking about
he is the most arrogant
cocky guy
I kind of hate him when he talks
because of his arrogance
now I don't think he could turn that off
I I watched him he was being filmed just
leaving the White House so he'd visited
the White House to you know make himself
look like more of a national candidate I
guess so Biden wasn't even at the White
House when he visited so who knows what
he was doing but he leaves and he's got
his you know he's got his little jacket
over his shoulder and he's got that
Swagger and that look in his face
and you just want to slap him
yeah he has the most laughable face
I don't believe in violence I'm not
advocating violence but you see as dumb
arrogant face and he's just like oh
there's no way I could look at that for
four years
and I'm I was actually fairly Pro
Newsome in terms of his uh skills
I still think he has skills
but he has to turn off the face
that face is not getting you elected I
don't think I don't I don't see how
I don't see how the Democrat base
can vote for the whitest person in
America
acting arrogant like a tall rich white
guy
that feels like exactly the opposite of
the Democrat vibe
and how would the world
do the Democrats keep running old white
men
or even you know not so old white men
how in the world do they keep doing that
and getting away with it by the way did
you know that black support for
Democrats
just to support what I've predicted that
if you look at Black American support
for Democrats it's at an all-time high
among women
so black women are supporting Democrats
at an all-time high rate black men are
starting to Desert to Republicans did
you know that
that the black vote has has bifurcated
male and female
now this supports what I've been saying
that the Democrat Party is a party of
women
it's it's run by women effectively even
if they don't have the jobs that would
suggest they're in charge but is
effectively run by women because you
can't do anything as a Democrat that
women are not a hundred percent behind
so they control what you know what
happens and I think that the Republican
Party
is becoming sort of the dad party
and the Democrats are becoming the mom
party
and it's exactly what you think in terms
of why some would be important at
different times in history because you
know from your own life if you have a
mother and a father that there are times
when
dad is the right answer
right you got trouble
you got trouble with another country son
call Dad
dad will make sure that little rocket
man doesn't send any rockets at you Dad
will make sure that Russia doesn't
invade Ukraine and that will make sure
that China doesn't go into Taiwan that's
that's dad business
mom will make sure you get fed if you're
hungry
right so she's just making sure you've
got your Basics so if you're worried
mostly about your basics
then you want mom
if you're worried about
destruction from outside forces
you definitely want Dad
so they have become the mom and dad
party and I'm wondering if Trump could
take advantage of that
the first thing I'd wonder is if if I
were Trump
I would mock continuously the fact that
the Democrats want an old white guy for
their their standard Bearer
and I would just joke with the fact that
he was also an old white guy if I were
if I were a trump he could actually say
this he'd go look
does it make sense that we're running
two old white guys for president
I mean I'm glad that I'm in the race
because I have something to offer but
why are the Democrats offering you only
the same thing that I'm offering an old
white guy if you want an old white guy
I'm your old white guy I've already done
this job I'm great at it
but there but it doesn't make sense for
the Democrats to be offering an old
white guy that's the opposite of your
brand why are you doing that
so I think actually Trump could Embrace
himself being an old white guy just say
well I'm unique
you know I was president before you know
what you're gonna get and
and Biden's just a bad choice
because he doesn't represent the the
primary well let me put it this way the
Republicans are all about capability
so if he can demonstrate the capability
he should be president
that would be consistent with Republican
theory it's not about your identity it's
just capability
the Democrats are all about identity
so for them to pick Biden because he can
win
seems outside of their brand
they should pick somebody who's the
right person even if they can't win
that would be consistent with the brand
now of course winning matters to
everybody but I think uh Trump could
tear him apart by mocking them for not
not being true to their own philosophy
if you say you can't even believe them
to be true to their own core philosophy
how can you trust it with anything else
at least you know Republicans are going
to favor getting the job done over
identity you can count on that you can
count on if we have to choose between
looking good and doing the work we're
going to do the work because we always
do
just think think about how strong that
message is
when Republicans have to choose between
looking good and doing the work we
always do the work
that's what we promise you that's what
we always do
Democrats are going to choose looking
good
and even Democrats know that
that's why it works even Democrats know
that they will choose looking good over
getting the job done
you say that
and you're going to give some Democrats
to vote for your Republicans
all right
um
so Trump uh did his interview on Tucker
Carlson and I didn't get to watch the
whole thing but I picked up kind of the
vibe early on
and
as you know when I talk about Trump if I
talk lovingly about his technique it
doesn't mean I agree with all of his
policies or that he's never done
anything you don't like it just means he
might have done some technique that was
good
here again he's doing some good
technique
he talked about what he was being
arraigned that the some of the police or
officials involved were literally crying
because they thought it was so unfair
now that's so good
now I can't prove that Eddie that's true
you know there's no fact-checking that
would know that that's true or not so
that's good it's hard to fact check and
it might have been one person
right but it still in terms of
persuasion you could actually picture
the police crying
because they had to arrest him
it's very good
all right and he led with that that was
like his first introduction to the to
the topic was that people were crying
when he was a rape
I love that that is so good persuasion
wise because that brings you right into
the scene doesn't it that put you that
put you next to Trump
while he's being fingerprinted I don't
know if he was fingerprinted probably
not but whatever they were doing you
know that that he had to be told to do
because he was being arrested or being
arraigned uh you could you're just right
there and you're seeing the people
crying you're seeing them where like
police outfits and like tears running
down their cheeks he is so visual
his visual sense
of communication is just unparalleled he
goes right to the picture
so that was good then he sort of changed
the subject from uh
from the you know the current problem
because everybody I think you sold at
least all the Republicans that it's
um an illegitimate prosecution and he
even used examples of people who are not
his friends who said it was illegitimate
and then he talked about uh the his
other two problems one he calls box gate
what's he called the other one uh
box gate and uh
uh
and although the Box hoax he calls it
the Box hoax that's the Mar-A-Lago
documents and then his phone call with
the uh
with Georgia where he asked them to find
votes he's he's labeled that a perfect
call
so he's got so everything everything
gets a brand
and every time you brand something I
laugh because it always works so he's
got the box hoax which I'm totally going
to use right as soon as you hear a box
of hoax because those words even go
together well because they both have an
x on the end it's a box hoax
now imagine if he had chosen secret
document hoax
if you thought it was a secret document
hoax it would still have secret document
in it and you say oh secret documents
that could be important
but he doesn't do Secret documents he
goes boxed
do you know why box
because a box is visual
you can see a box it's in your head
and now it's about a box
that's so good it's so good it makes you
ever forget about what was in the Box
what's in the box it doesn't matter it's
a hoax it's a box hoax yeah but what's
in the box how would that matter
it's not about what's in them it's about
the box it's Oaks
and then
uh what was the other one oh the perfect
call so he is reintroducing the perfect
call
thing I don't know if that's his
strongest work the perfect call but it's
not bad
all right um
and then uh Tucker seemed to be all in
on Trump
if anybody saw the interview would you
say that Tucker is
clearly
supportive of trump at least as a
candidate
it looked like it and haven't we seen
reports that Tucker didn't like Trump
like secret emails that he was mad at
Trump or something
but they look like best friends
like even the chemistry as they were
sitting there looked perfectly
comfortable
and then what Tucker said was also
perfectly complementary because his so
Tucker's take was that
Biden is the most dangerous of the two
presidents because Biden's the one that
left the Ukraine war happen he's the one
that and travel through the situations
according to Trump
um you're wrapped up pretty tight
now I don't know if that's true
but he does have a good a good version
of events where he had to threatened the
big Powers they were sure that the
threats were real but 10 true as he says
yeah they ten percent believe me and by
the way I love when he says that yeah
Putin didn't believe my threats but he
10 believed it and then he said the same
thing about she he didn't believe my
threats
but he ten percent believed it and that
was enough to stop him cold
and it's funny because even when he
talks about it he's talking about it
like they shouldn't have believed it
like it wasn't even a real threat
and it still worked
all right
um
I'm seeing a comment that says Daniel
Day Lewis is overrated
I'm not sure how that fits into the
topic
but
it probably does somehow
all right
here's the uh
oh and then Trump says nuclear war is
the biggest problem not climate change
and the climate change people have a
problem because the climate is not
acting the way it's supposed to act
according to their narrative now we do
understand that any five or ten year
period is not necessarily telling you
something important
because it's the longer term trend
but it's still a problem
if your narrative is you should be
alarmed by everything is heading in the
right direction instead of the wrong
direction it's tough to get that
argument to land
and California is a perfect example
California doesn't get enough rain and
it's because of climate change
California gets blasted with more rain
than we've ever seen and must be climate
change
yeah so the story is kind of falling
apart a little bit
uh we're worried about climate change
but we're closing our nuclear plants
right none of us it's just not lining up
at the moment so Trump cleverly is
saying the big problem is potential
nuclear war
and then he tells a very scary story
which is also visual he tells the story
of how powerful the uh the atomic
weapons are nuclear weapons and he says
that in Hiroshima
which is he says some people call
Hiroshima
the way he talks is just so damn funny
he said that Granite was uh melted by
the nuclear blast and you can't melt
Granite even with a blowtorch now that
is the most visual
uh explanation of a nuclear weapon it
melted granite and you can't melt that
with a blowtorch you said that they
found the granite looking like it had
liquefied
is so visual just so visual
it's amazing and I would say that Trump
looked energetic and did not look like
he'd lost anything to age yet he did
seem a little tired of the night he got
arraigned but you can kind of understand
that that was probably a bad night
the night before
all right a big headline today is that
inflation seems to have eased to five
percent and that's lowest has been in
nearly two years still alarmingly high
but not nearly as alarming
as maybe you thought it could have been
now
have I ever told you that economists are
terrible at predicting the economy
have you ever noticed that what is the
one thing that a hundred percent of all
economists were sure of
that inflation was wildly out of control
and we weren't doing anything to stop it
at least not enough
but it looks like it's slowing down
now that's not just because of interest
rates is it
or just because the economy is slowing a
little bit on its own
I don't understand why inflation could
ever go down because our debt situation
is worse not better
right this is the death situation is
worse not better
so
I guess this is more evidence that we
can't predict anything this complicated
we can't predict the climate we can't
predict the economy we can't predict
elections
we can't really predict any you know
Ukraine war there's nothing we can
predict
but we keep acting like we can
I I don't know what that means
somebody just said that my wife must use
a diffuser on my head
what
first of all I'm not married but second
of all I don't know what a diffuser is
and I certainly don't know why I'd use
it on my head
but okay
ndr is left Twitter is that true
that's funny
who does that hurt does that hurt uh
Twitter has that heard NPR
I would have to think it hurts NPR more
than hers Twitter
we'll see
all right um
I guess what I would add to this is that
my biggest concern for the country was
inflation
to me that was number one because I
think the other stuff actually we have
under control
but inflation I didn't even know how you
could get it on control I didn't even
know what plan could possibly work
but it seems to be reducing
Peter zehan predicted the Ukraine war no
I'm not talking about predicting that a
war happens I'm talking about predicting
how the world would go
predicting how the war would go people
who did pretty poorly on that except for
me it turns out I was the only one who
predicted that Ukraine would stop Russia
so far I could still be wrong
but so far now who was I listening to
somebody smart was it Zan now somebody
else a CIA operative I guess
was saying that Russia is definitely
winning in the Ukraine
and the the thinking was that they have
unlimited time to just grind on them
and nothing's changing that
as long as they want to keep grinding
they still have money they still have
resources they still make more bullets
yeah Bustamante you're right
um
that if you were to if you were to
predicted forward there's only one
prediction there's one side that's not
going to quit
and they've got a reason not to quit
they've got a pretty good reason
that's a pretty good that's a good story
now I don't think that's going to happen
I think it's going to be negotiated I
think Russia will keep the Russia you
know the primary russia-speaking groups
and there'll be something called Ukraine
that's got less territory than before I
think that's how it's going to end now
it might require Trump to be president
so I don't think it's going to happen
anytime soon but
uh that's what I think is going to
happen I think a lot of people think
that
all right what do you think about these
Ukraine military leaks so the experts
are saying a lot of it looks real
I guess I had stuff to do with Ukrainian
military defense weaknesses and some
other stuff that apparently matters the
experts think that the leaks were bad
enough they could have gotten people
killed
so that's pretty bad but others say that
there there's enough
sketchy looking stuff in the leaks
that at least some part of it
that at least some part of it
looked like it was fake
and then some people say oh it's Russian
disinformation
so the Russians are putting out like
some fake stuff
well maybe
here's my my assumption I think that our
side put it out
I think it's a fake League
and that the Ukrainian weaknesses are
probably not real weaknesses in other
words it might be trying to
convince the Russians to take a
different strategy than the one they
have and it would convince them to take
a weaker strategy instead of a stronger
one
so my guess is
that the documents have some real stuff
in them so that it looks real
but that the things that mattered the
only things that mattered were fake
and that it would basically fool the uh
cope
there's another cope NPC here
you copers are all alike I think you're
all binaries you don't understand
anything except yes or no
oh
oh people are questioning my expert
opinion oh let me let me tell you how
was your expert opinion of how Russia
would do in the war against Ukraine
how'd that go how did the experts do
compared to me
I beat all of the experts
so far
right so you can say um you can mock me
for not being an expert but you should
also accept that I've beaten all the
experts so far
and I fairly consistently beat the
experts on a wide range of topics
in fact
predicting better than the experts is
the only reason you're here
because I can consistently do it
it's the only reason you're here
all right
but not every time of course I've I've
been wrong as well
so
um that's my take if I had to guess and
it would only be a guess like 60 40 kind
of guess my guess is that some part of
it is fake but the faking is not coming
from Russia
the faking is more likely coming from
the Ukrainian side
uh how many would uh would agree that
there's at least that the would agree
that it's at least a working hypothesis
how many would agree that it's at least
possible
at least possible Right
because once you've seen you know how
disinformation works you know the hunter
laptop and everything else once you see
it it's usually not the people you think
who put out the misinformation
usually the people who are complaining
about the misinformation are the sources
of it yeah we see this over and over
what what did uh what did the government
and the FBI and everybody say about
Russia collusion
that it was real and the people who said
it wasn't real were lying but it turns
out that the people who were in charge
were lying
so we we do have a history of the people
who say those other people did this it
was really the people complaining who
did it
so that's my guess
there are a bunch of medical cures
coming which is interesting because it's
the same time that population is going
into a decline in industrialized
countries
and or at least Western countries mostly
no I guess it's industrialized countries
it includes the includes Asia
but uh some of the medical cure is
coming at the same time that we don't
need any more babies because we'll have
robots and AI Michael Milken had an
article on this and
apparently we'll be able to routinely
clean tiny cancers from our body
just normal like if you've got a early
cancer you just be able to you know take
some pills and just make it go away
or maybe get a shot I don't know so he's
saying that that's coming pretty soon
um
immunity from dozens of viruses with a
single vaccine I don't think people are
going to take his advice on that part by
editing genes to eliminate birth defects
that's amazing
growing new organs from patients own
cells and even slowing the aging process
so
if you think we've got a problem with
too many old people compared to young
people
what happens when they don't die
old people kind of have to die don't
they like our entire system depends on
the old ones dying if the old ones don't
die
the new ones don't inherit you know
nobody gets ownership of the companies
the whole system would fail
wouldn't it
I don't know we we have we'd have to
rewrite the system somehow fairly
substantially
but I worry that we'll solve our aging
and everything else but we won't have
any money and we'll wish we were dead
do you think we'll get to the point
where we can live forever while wishing
we were dead
here's why I listen to this I lost a
little bit of respect for Scott Adams
when he freaked out over the coven stuff
you know that never happened right
do you know that
do you know that you you you fell for a
hoax by the Reddit and 4chan people
I I was literally famous for telling
people not to freak out
in fact my brand
the thing I was most well known for is
doing a nightly broadcast telling people
not to freak out about the covet
so you got you got badly hoaxed my
friend
right now I was part of making that hoax
seem real because I played along with it
for a long time
and I even apologized for the thing that
never happened
because I thought it was funny
and it made people like you think that I
had changed my views
so
uh you you need to you need to check
yourself because you fell for a pretty
big hoax
and you should be embarrassed by that
and Lyle says more cope the the NPCs
only have one word
cope
cope
I'm going to call you the the opcs for
the cope Department
uh uh so we know the truth
please stop calling it a hoax
so we know the truth no you didn't you
don't know the truth
if if you think that I was pro-vaccine
Pro Max and panicked about the virus you
do not know the truth
and it's easy to demonstrate that there
are people who have comments here so you
tell me
you tell me was I Pro mask and
pro-vaccination
no they'll tell you they've been
listening to me every single day no see
there so if you believe the the opposite
of reality as all of these people are
telling you the problem is clearly with
you
just look at all the other people who
watched every single thing I said for
two years they watched every word I said
and they all have the same opinion but
the people who disagree
have a different opinion didn't watch me
as much or they only saw selected tweets
and stuff now the
um yeah but still
why do I block block cat turd
do you want me to tell you why I block
cat turd because he also believed the
same hoax you did
and he was pretty pretty vocal about it
yeah so Catherine is an idiot I don't
know if you know that
he's an idiot
so you don't want more exposure to him
he was entertaining for a while but he
was an idiot
uh
so Al says Scott was provax and pro mask
at various points no no there was no
point there were various points where I
told you the pros and cons of everything
that was discussed
there were times when I told you what
the study said
sometimes the studies were wrong
there are times when I told you uh what
was true from an engineering perspective
about masks but I never said that they
were worth using
except in weird situations Maybe
yeah so if you if you know me mostly
from Twitter
you saw people like Kat turd and various
idiots put together the things where I
talked about the pro of something and
then they would leave out the part where
they I talk about the Khan
so you wouldn't see the cost benefit
analysis you would just see one side and
the reason that fooled you do you know
why that fooled you
because you're binaries
it only fooled you if you're an NPC
because the NPC is KFC Nuance so they
would be invisible it would be invisible
to them that anybody could say something
has a pro to it
if there's also a conduit
see so that's why it confuses you I can
say well there might be these benefits
for these people
but there would be no benefits for these
people and then you would see one of
those and you say he says there's
benefits he's pro-vax
nope nope clown show
trust no expert was the Common Thread to
everything I said that is correct
so raise your hand uh I want to see how
many NPCs there are on
on here raise your hand if you believe
that I'm lying about my pandemic views
go ahead
I want you to out yourself as believing
the hoax
okay we've got some people
there's somebody who just wants clown
and emojis that's a dead PC
lying as an NPC CIA NPC
yeah there are a lot of NPCs today on
YouTube
it's the people who literally can't
handle the cost benefit analysis that's
the the idea of cost benefit is just too
hard
let's move on
all right enough of that all right
YouTube I'm gonna uh
talk to you later I'm sorry that 4chan
and Reddit did that to you maybe you can
find a some kind of way to recover from
that damage
bye for now
