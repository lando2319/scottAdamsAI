good morning everybody and welcome to an
experience that i think will be
unparalleled
at least until tomorrow and it's called
the simultaneous sip and coffee with
scott adams
and i don't think there's anything
better in this reality or any metaverse
whatsoever
but if you'd like to take it up a notch
i think you do all you need is a cup
copper mugger glasses tanker chelsea
steiner canteen juggerflask vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing makes
everything better except for
the brandon administration
more
go
oh yeah
yeah the antibodies just coursing
through my body
whoa whoa got a little extra antibodies
in my shoulder
gonna work it out work it out spread it
out there we go
you don't want all your antibodies in
one part
you need to need to get moving shake
them around a little bit
well you also that ron desantis
is
once again following in president
trump's
shadow and footsteps
came up with his own sticky nickname
yes he calls it the brandon
administration as i borrowed his joke
just a moment ago
the brampton administration
always gets a big laugh from the
partisans let's talk about the things
that are happening
uh things are happening
let's see uh vaccination mandates going
into effect
uh january 4th for big employers over
100 people
what is there to say about that
you know i could say i don't like them
you could say you don't like them
but here's the only thing i'm going to
add to this
if you think it's the government that is
mandating this you're completely wrong
that's probably what most you think you
think the government is mandating it
um
and
i would argue that that's only
technically true
it is true that the government is
mandating it and they have rules and
whatnot
but i remind you
as uh rasmussen reminded me today
they've got a new poll rasmussen poll
52 percent of uh 52 percent
of the public
um surveyed
support workers refusing vaccinations
but that means
there's a whole bunch of people who
don't
so
just slightly more than half of the
country
is in favor of you know not doing these
mandates here's the thing you need to
know
if that were 75 it wouldn't be happening
how many disagree with me
so here's the point right now
52 percent of workers
support not making people have to get
vaccinations so they're opposed to the
mandate but only 52 percent
hypothetically if it were 75
would it be happening
anybody
does anybody think it would happen if it
were 75 we're against it
i don't think so
i don't think so now you could disagree
where where that number is 75 or 90 or
whatever but my point is the only reason
the government can do this is because
the public
by enough people are on board
just barely
if it feels like it's sort of a slim
majority but you're not you're not
dealing with the government you're
dealing with your fellow citizens
if you could convince you know half of
the remaining people who were four
mandates
to take your side you'd have 75 people
against mandates and they just wouldn't
happen
does anybody doubt that
that's my take on it so i i think that
we often um
mistake where power is
power is with the people completely
uh in this country that will just always
be the case at least for anything long
term
if we have you know if we need quick
decisions you know such as a war
situation then we actually prefer the
government to do it because it has to be
quick but for these longer term
considered
you know topics
we really have the power
completely
but we have to be on the same side or we
have nothing
so
that's the difference i suppose if the
government can keep us confused and
ignorant they do have the power
um
there are effectively three political
parties now
would you agree
two of them are called democrats you got
your progressives and then your standard
standard democrats i guess but then
republicans are more of a unified so
it's like three
three different parties
and
let me make a suggestion
this has opened up the door
very much though
for a new party maybe for the first time
i don't think that a third party really
had a choice or a chance
uh and maybe they still don't but it's
the biggest opening i've seen here's how
i would do it
this is me running for president as an
independent starting my own third party
or fourth party depending on how you
count them
i would call it
the middle party
i would call it
the middle party
and i would say i oppose the extreme
right and the extreme left
and most people do
unless you're wed
to the name on your
registration
consider the middle party
because i'm going to give you stuff that
makes sense i might raise your taxes a
little
but not a lot and i would do it with the
support of economists and and lots of uh
and lots of support that it makes sense
economically
uh i might
do something that would benefit the
black population of this country
but it will make sense it won't be
stupid
right
so
don't you think that a the right
candidate you'd have to be the right
person but don't you think that the
middle party and the name of it is very
important
if you say you're some other party
then people say oh why do i want to be
that but if you say you're the middle
party
guess what
you can stay republican
you can stay democrat
you're just voting for the middle
a lot of people like the middle but they
prefer to be a republican
they rep prefer to be a democrat
but they might vote for the middle
so give them a give them something to
vote for
and then every time somebody says you
know what side are you on you just stake
out the middle
the sensible middle and say look this is
where the people are
the people are in the sensible middle
take any topic
take any topic
uh
the school system
you could say uh yeah we're going to
keep our public schools but we're going
to keep the option open
for competition
totally in the middle totally supported
and you know you could just go right
down the line on different topics how
about abortion
if you're running for president you have
to talk about it but here's how i'd
handle it if i were the head of the
middle party
i'd say it's not a federal government
decision
and i'm not going to make it one
because i think the authority for that
should be pushed down to the lowest
level you can get it state level ideally
and i just say i'm out
i'm the middle
whatever whatever the country wants
state by state
it's fine with me
i think that could win you'd have to
have exactly the right candidate though
everybody's talking about why did yunkin
win
have you noticed that whenever anything
happens there are lots of explanations
when trump
unexpectedly won in 2016
what was
the news all about the next day
it was all about why he won
and all the reasons were different it
was all over the place i think
cnn had 14 different reasons he won
but here's the thing
with a big complicated thing like an
election
it's never one thing
it's all of the things
every one of the things had to be the
way they were for him to get the result
he did if any of those things had been
different
you were lost so is it sensible to say
there's one there's one
thing not really
because it's sort of the haystack thing
it might be the last straw
but it's just one of the straws right is
the last straw the special one
no it just came last so there might be
something that you know breaks
breaks the log jam there but it's not
special there's nothing about that one
straw
so here are the things people are saying
about younkins number one
it's just a historical pattern
i said this yesterday it turns out that
this is exactly the result
you could have predicted based on
historical pattern
that if you have a president one party
virginia will go to the other party
and eight times in a row it's happened
so that's one way
the other of course is that the focus
was on critical race theory
but i have a uh
and and you know of course young can
want to ran a good campaign etc
and i think he did a good job
of keeping some distance from trump and
it helped that he didn't have any
history as a politician
so those are all good
again you can't say there's one reason
you want it's all of those things had to
happen
but i would like to add another variable
just speculation
i have a hypothesis and maybe somebody's
i haven't googled this maybe it's
already been tested
but
i feel as if i've seen a study where you
can show you can show people who don't
know who the candidates are could be
some other country where you're not
familiar with the candidates and that
people can guess who would win the
election
by looking at their
photographs did you know that
that the public
i and i i need a fact check on this but
i read this a long time ago
i think that that people can tell
who's going to win an election by
looking at the photographs even without
even knowing the names of the candidates
or what they're running for
can somebody confirm that's true i think
that's true
now i would add a second factor
i would i would bet that i now i don't
know if this is generalizable but
probably it is i'm just going to say it
about myself
i believe that if you gave me audio
clips
of each candidate
in a closest race so it'd have to be a
race
where you think that both have at least
a chance of winning you know not not
blowouts
but
in a close race if you give me just the
audio
of each of their speeches for
uh
10 to 15 seconds it wouldn't matter what
part of the what topic it was
10 to 15 seconds of just hearing them
talk
i can pick the winner
that's my claim
now not every time of course but i'll
bet i could get a 75 of the time plus
what do you think
do you think i could get that right 75
percent of the time
i don't know
but if you heard obama talking and
compared him to whoever he ran against i
think you could have picked him
and
and when i heard an audio of
jungkin talking
compared to
terry mcauliffe talking
i said to myself
if this is close
young kid's going to win
because there's something in his voice
or his presentation or his confidence or
i don't know what it is
i don't know i don't exactly know what
it is but there's definitely such a
thing as
command voice wouldn't you say
nobody's going to argue with that right
there is such a thing as command voice
and women have it too right it's not a
gender thing
women can have a command voice if you've
ever worked for
a really good female boss
oh they haven't
they have command voice it's just the
female version of it
but it's command voice
and i thought young kid had command
voice and i thought mcauliffe was weak
there so when i heard it i was like whoa
that doesn't even sound close to me it
looks like it looks like one good
candidate and one not so good just on
that 15 seconds of voice and i said to
myself i think this guy's gonna win and
i wasn't even following the race
command presence that's i guess that's
the better
better phrase for it right
all right
we have some more fun stuff going on
ap
did a fact check today
see if you agree with this fact check
what do you think
ap says posts continue to circulate
online
falsely claiming that coven 19 survivors
don't need vaccines because of natural
immunity
in fact says the ap fact checkers that
protection is variable and not long
lasting so vaccines are still
recommended
here's our recent blah blah
um
so here's my take on that here's the
exact claim
that uh
that if you're if you've already been
infected and recovered
that your protection is variable and not
long lasting
is that true
so before before we get to all of it the
bigger picture is the limited claim
correct
that natural immunity is variable
well first of all just a little just ask
you is it variable do you think there
are people with good natural immunity
and some with not so good
it's true right
so i would say that's true people have
is variable
and it's also not long lasting
well what's that mean
what does not long lasting mean
well it means anything they wanted to so
i'm not going to say it's false
because wouldn't you like your immunity
to last forever
you would right so the standard that
would make you happy is it lasts forever
because there are other immunities that
seem to last forever
and they're saying that this doesn't do
that
so it's not long enough
to make us happy is that fair is it fair
to say that unlike
unlike other uh
types of natural immunity it wouldn't be
as as good
right but now let's talk about the
vaccination itself yeah you're getting
ahead of me
the vaccination itself is that
variable
yes it is
same as natural immunity has everybody
on the same page so far
that there's great individual
variability
both in natural immunity
and in vaccine immunity we're all on the
same page in that right very variability
so no difference there
in the sense that they're both variable
you know it might be a different
variability but plenty enough to say
that they're similar
how about whether vaccinations
themselves are long lasting
well no that's why we get boosters so
you've got vaccinations that are not
that are very variable
they're variable let's say
vaccinations are variable and not
long-lasting natural immunity is also
variable and not long-lasting so
do you say to yourself therefore
therefore i should not get a vaccination
because these are two things that are
the same
they're both variable
and they're both not long lasting
is that is that good thinking now we're
going to talk about vaccine side effects
but for the moment is that good thinking
it's not good thinking right so um
i'm going to just help you on the the
thinking part of it here right your
opinion is your own
and none of us are going to have enough
really information for
in my opinion to have an informed
opinion
there's a little bit of guessing all
right here's what's here's what the
difference is
if you get the vaccination
do you have the option of giving
yourself natural immunity on top of it
well accidentally or i suppose you could
but generally that's not going to happen
right you're not going to
intentionally get infected most people
aren't
some might
whereas if you get natural immunity you
could make the decision to get
vaccinated or not so they don't work
equally in both directions
are we okay so far
they're not equivalent
because in one case you can get both in
a logical rational way in the other case
you wouldn't get both
because you you got your natural
immunity and you say no
no more that's i don't need any more
okay
so so there's a little bit of difference
but here's my argument
when it comes to antibodies aren't more
better
does anybody disagree with that having
more antibodies
would be better
now we will talk about the risks so hold
that i'm not going to forget about them
but when you say more antibodies are
better than fewer
so what would be the argument not to
have both
gives you more antibodies right so
whether you have good natural protection
or not
you get a little extra little little
turbo boost
so is the government wrong in saying
that being naturally immune since they
can't tell if it's a good one
a good immunity or a weak immunity
and they can't tell how long it'll last
would it not be good risk management
if if the vaccines were perfectly safe
and we'll talk about the risk but if
they were perfectly safe
wouldn't it make sense to do both
and that's not the case
there's no such thing as a vaccine
that's perfectly safe
but if it were
wouldn't you say that getting a little
extra would help you
i would say that's just math
that's just addition
you can't you can't argue that this much
immunity
is better than this much immunity plus a
little extra
right there's no argument for that
that's just math it's like money
you know what's better twenty dollars or
a hundred dollars
there's no argument
a hundred dollars is better than twenty
dollars with antibodies
i don't think there's an argument is
there i mean i'm open to it but i
haven't heard one isn't more antibodies
better
right
so it really comes down to the extra
risk doesn't it
wouldn't you say
the extra risk of the vaccination
and i would think that a person who has
natural immunity
should
make their own decision
about whether they get vaccinated
because the government can't tell you
what your extra risk is
nor can they tell you if you have enough
immunity that you're in good shape with
or without a vaccination they're not
testing your antibodies or how long
they're going to last they don't know
and you don't know either
if the government doesn't know what's up
with you and you don't know what's up
with you because you don't know if your
natural immunity is the good kind of the
bad kind you don't really know if those
extra vaccinations would give you any
protection
but you do know there's a risk
you don't know how big it is because
nobody knows
but you got a risk
right
all right
so i would say that the argument is
squarely on the side of uh letting
people with natural immunity decide for
themselves whether they want
vaccinations
and ap fact check
uh might be technically true but i feel
like it's leaving out some variables
here
all right
so there was a twitter twitter user
ward q normal i don't think that's his
real name maybe it is i don't know
but he says uh i will pay you a thousand
dollars he was replying to somebody else
if you can define critical race theory
and point to a single k-12 school in
virginia that has ever taught it so
there's a thousand dollars
if you can define critical race theory
and point to a single time it's been
taught
do you think you could do that well
every every republican thinks they can
do that and get that thousand dollars
you think you'll pay
no he will not because no matter what
you point to
what's he gonna say
that's not critical race theory
you'll say well
but look at this here's the book it's
like totally based on critical race
theory
and what would ward q normal say
when you ask for your thousand dollars
having proven it beyond a shadow of a
doubt
ward q normal would say
no that's not critical race theory no
no you're mistaken that's that's just
history
you're just reading history
so
we have this weird situation where we
have this thing that can't be defined by
ordinary people i do believe you know
experts could probably define it if they
study this thing but for ordinary people
they seem to be confused
and therefore there seems to be some
issue
that the democrats are arguing no no
it's imaginary it's not really there but
let me tell you
what people are really good at
identifying
people are not really good at
identifying
if something fits a definition
so we're kind of arguing the definition
of critical race theory we're not good
at that but i'll tell you what we are
good at
we are good at knowing if the curriculum
is anti-white
i think we'd be good at knowing if it
was anti-anything
because that's pretty easy to spot
i don't care what it's called
you can call it critical race
theory if you want
call it anything you want
but if it's anti-any ethnicity
it doesn't matter which one
you got to get rid of it
there's no
there's no wiggle room there
if it's racist
it doesn't matter which race you're
targeting
got to get rid of it
that's that's not debatable
so
um
here's how cnn refers to it they say the
term critical race theory refers to the
academic concept that racism has been
systematically ingrained in american
society
following centuries of slavery
and i would say that most people would
agree that that's what critical race
theory is would you agree
that the big picture that's what it is
but the issue is when they try to you
know break it down into its lessons
what's it turn into
and what it turns into is something else
when you turn it into action
and
and that conservatives are claiming that
critical race theory teaches children to
think the united states is racist
now isn't that true
these are two sentences both from an
opinion piece on cnn today by manu raju
alex rogers and melanie
zanona
and see if these two sentences and
they're both right together
make sense to you
they say the term critical race theory
blah blah
means that uh racism has been
systematically ingrained in american
society
and then they say but conservatives
are claiming it teaches children to
think the united states is racist
but isn't that what they just said
they just said that critical race theory
says that we have systemic racism
and then they're blaming acting like
conservatives are dumb for saying it
teaches you that the united states is
racist isn't that exactly what they just
said
i mean you could say it's the system
but then that's the united states
it doesn't mean every person is
necessarily racist but
all right
we'll get back to that in a minute so
biden doesn't
think he influences gas prices or no
paul krugman
so nobel winner nobel economic
nobel in economics winner paul krugman
says
voters shouldn't be mad at biden because
he has no control over the price of
gasoline
what
you think the president has no control
over our energy policy
pretty sure he does
as a michael schellenberger noted
um us is the world's largest producer
of oil and by biden froze new oil and
gas leases in january
and he may be open opening the strategic
petroleum reserve to lower prices
so he certainly has control
some control not complete control of
course
and then i would think that any push
toward green
and
penalizing oil would you have a have an
impact et cetera
well we got a great uh i think it's a
drunk tweet from cher
performer cher
i i want to show you you can see her
these are the all caps
craziness and i'm going to read her
tweet
that again is in all caps but i'm going
to read it uh in the character of a
drunk person
because i don't think you can read this
sober i think it needs to be drunk
allow me to get in character for a
moment
and now
i read this as share after five martinis
tweeting in all caps
zhao works tireless to
to number two work with kang and pass
mills to help everyday americans and
he's here from that on right left
because gridlock well gop says some
plans how to
pick our bones clean if we fail geopoly
or nazis and lockstep is different
between democrats
i assume she passed down toward the end
of that i don't know
but never never drink and tweet
uh don't be a cher
here's some fake news that you think is
true
and it turns on the word considering
let me give you an a little primer story
one day in the context of dealing with
some
medical issue of no consequence
my uh
doctor just some somewhat routinely
asked me if i ever
had thoughts of suicide or had i ever
considered suicide
and i said sure every day
and i didn't realize that was the wrong
answer
because it turns out if you say that
which of course is true
i do consider it every day and then i
rule it out
do you know what else i consider
jumping off the roof
just to see if i can fly under my own
power
i think about that every day
and then i rule it out
i consider everything
what the hell do you not consider
do you remember when
trump famously was asked if he was
considering
firing somebody in this administration
as some press release and trump quite
accurately said i consider firing
everybody
that's the right answer it's a perfect
answer by the way
trump does not get nearly enough credit
for the answers that he does that are
perfect because you know the the ones
that are provocative and more fun but
that's a perfect answer yes i consider
firing every person on my staff every
day
that's the only right answer
so here's the fake news
that uh
that the government or the i guess the
doj is considering
considering i say
based on the aclu talking to the dog
they considered
or discussed
paying 450 000 dollars apiece to every
immigrant separated from their families
at the border under trump
now
do you think that's true news or fake
news
that it was considered
true news or fake well when
biden was asked by fox news
if it was true biden says it's garbage
he says no it's not true it's garbage
now the aclu a medial said wait a minute
wait a minute we are literally talking
to the department of justice right now
and we are literally
right now
discussing 450 000 payments
so who's right
biden
or the aclu go
who's right
which one has the right
uh take on it
both
they're both right
biden is 100 right
because he's looking at it politically i
assume
and he is quite correctly saying there's
no freaking way this is going to happen
do you know why it's not going to happen
because it would destroy the democratic
party forever
it would be the end
do you think biden doesn't know that
do you do you think he can maintain the
black vote if he doesn't do reparations
but he pays 450 000 to the immigrants
coming across you think he can keep the
black vote if he does that
it's the end of the democratic party
so when you say scott
but
it's been confirmed the aclu confirmed
it
yeah they're considering it
they're considering it just like i
consider taking my own life every single
day
it's things you think about that never
happen
so
now of course you might say to yourself
but it might be
you know a smaller number
well
they could try but suppose they talked
it down to let's just pick a number 450
000 i saw somebody on twitter said maybe
they could get it down to 80 000 a piece
that still still okay
do you think biden's gonna want
democrats to run again
knowing that the democratic government
gave people who broke a law in this
country 80 thousand dollars a piece
because we inconvenienced them
i mean it's a more than inconvenience
but you know i'm speaking sort of
hyperbolic here
um
no no the democratic party would just be
out of business completely even more
than they probably are we'll talk about
that
but
in my opinion it is so completely
politically impossible that biden was
telling the absolute truth
by i think biden's answer that it was
garbage is the accurate one
politically speaking now of course the
dog doj can act independently right
but it looks like the republicans are
going to do a bill and maybe stop the
payments even if
the dog wanted to blah blah so there
will be plenty of
machinations that will stop this from
happening i don't think you have to
worry about it
so it's a semi-fake news it's true and
false at the same time
um
tom elliott
tweeted a little clip in which former
obama campaign manager stephanie cutter
was talking about the election in
virginia and she said the one thing that
we need to make sure of is that
republicans in 2022
don't become the party of parents
because they
the democrats know they're in trouble
if the republicans
become obviously the ones who are taking
care of children
and the democrats are not is she right
well
too late
too late
uh as mr durr
noted the truck driver who won his race
um as mr durr notes
uh
he said that the democrats went too far
because they were messing with our
children
so the truck driver be uh you know an
established incumbent
presumably on the message stop stop
messing with our children
now he said messing i use the f word
but
again
the democrats have this blind spot about
how republicans think
that i don't know is the same on the
other side it might be you know maybe
it's maybe that works both ways
but
there's a gigantic blind spot
let me give you there are two blind
spots
number one uh and i've talked about this
when alec baldwin had his tragic
firearms accident there
and
people on the left could not understand
why people on the right were saying no
it's alec baldwin's responsibility
period
when logical rational people were saying
wait a minute rationally
he was part of a system in which that
that responsibility was delegated it's a
mature system works all the time there's
a reason they do it
should have been safe he made a
reasonable decision there's no liability
now what's every gun owner say
blah blah blah he had the gun in his
hand it's his it's his responsibility
period
blah blah blah
now the the left can't understand that
because they're like ah
don't you understand
that clearly there can be exceptions
right you can make an exception
use your common sense
and make an exception
and the exception in this case would be
the the
the safety had been delegated to
somebody who's a professional to make
sure it's safe
that should have been good enough common
sense
and then the gun owners say
the gun was in his hand it's his
responsibility that's the end of the
conversation
who's right
well
there's a weird hybrid going on here i
believe that gun owners
are rationally irrational
here's what i mean
the moment you say you know this isn't
an absolute
you know we're going to say there are
gun safety rules and responsibilities
and stuff but use your common sense
so what happens the first time you say
use your common sense
how does that work out
well here's common sense don't leave a
loaded gun
around where there are children
like you wouldn't leave it on your table
loaded if any kids were in the room
right common sense no gun owner who was
responsible would do that but let's say
you use the other standard common sense
does everybody have the same amount of
common sense
[Laughter]
i don't think so
you don't think that that would give
permission for somebody to say yeah it's
available to the kid but it's not going
to happen because i'm closer to the
table than the children are and if i see
the children go for the gun i'll i'll
just get there first i'm just using my
common sense there's no way they're
going to get the gun
you know even though it's just sitting
right out there because i'm closer to
the table
common sense people if my kid is heading
toward the table
i'm going to protect the gun
then what happens
boom
right
you lose your concentration you walk
away a kid picks up the gun in trouble
so
i believe gun owners
pursue something i would call rational
irrationality
because it works
it is irrational to say there never can
be an exception
the reason they do it is because it
works
right
it's an irrational system that's the
only one that works so gun owners know
that
so when you argue no the responsibility
with somebody else gun owners don't even
want to have the conversation because
you don't want to open that door a crack
not even a crack because as soon as you
say common sense
is the standard
people get killed
every gun owner knows that now how many
how many people on the left
could have explained it
with the nuance that i just explained it
not many in fact i've never heard it
right
so
see that was gonna
dovetail into a really good point uh
probably oh here here was the point the
other blind spot that the democrats have
is uh the flexibility of republicans
am i right
because
you know you you can poke them forever
it seems like you know they'll poke you
oh you have to use this word
i hate that word you have to use it
anyway you have to use this word when
you first ah but i don't want to yeah
i'm poking you a little bit and then the
conservatives said you know
i got better things to do i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna die on that hill
and then i say you know i'm gonna raise
your taxes a little bit just a little
bit raise your taxes the republicans say
hey we hate that we hate that ah you
know
i got a lot to work on today
i'm not going to dedicate my life to
this one little area of life
and next to now they're just pushed and
pushed and pushed and that's what's been
happening it seems lately
but here's the blind spot
republicans are not flexible about
children
that's the red line
have you heard of abortion
republicans are not flexible about
children
and their safety and well-being and
their education especially
and as soon as the democrats crossed
that line and said you know how about we
educate your children the way we want to
and by the way we're going to turn them
against you we're going to tell your
children that you're a racist
your parents we're going to tell your
children
that you're a racist and you don't
understand science and climate change
and everything else
that's the red line
everything on the other side of the red
line is different from everything on the
other side
everything on the other side
a little bit flexible or at least maybe
not willing to fight for it
everything on the other side of the line
that's game over
that's game over
so in my opinion 2022 and 2024
are largely already decided
because the democrats you could call it
an overreach
but that really would be minimizing how
big of a problem this is
the the
republicans are now squarely
the party that's going to protect your
kids as well as their own
there's no question about that now and
not only that but they have the perfect
opening to partner with the black
american public
to fix schools because everybody wins
then right so
i you know of course it's always
dangerous to make predictions uh more
than a day in advance and even that's
dangerous so lots of things could change
between now and elections especially if
you know trump
makes some big waves somehow
but
um at this point the republicans have a
death grip on power
it'll take a while for the elections to
you know make that happen but i don't
see how a republican can lose unless
they're trying at this point
because all you have to do is say
they're destroying your children we're
protecting them
what do you care about
it's kind of over
so
here's the question if china wanted to
destroy the west but they had lots of
patience how would they do it
well there are lots of ways they were
doing it to do it but i think the main
way they do it would be to
um
to destroy our most powerful
uh let's say social cohesion
and what is the most powerful social
cohesion in this country
well marriage was for a long time and we
see that falling apart
but the other one is the melting pot
idea
you know when i grew up and many of you
as well
we were really brainwashed into saying
that the melting pot was our strength
and our power and to respect it
and i think i did
i think the brainwashing work i'm happy
about that i mean i call it brainwashing
because children shouldn't be making
their own decisions about the big stuff
you kind of have to brainwash them later
you hope that they can you know to think
for themselves
probably not
but there isn't a system better than
that because children can't really make
big decisions
um if i were china and i wanted to ruin
the west i would fund anybody
either secretly or not secretly who
pushed critical race theory
that would be with the wait for china to
destroy the country because it would uh
destroy the melting pot you know we're
all we're all at least have equal
opportunity
um even if you think that's not true
it's a good fiction to hold a country
together
and
so i would strongly wonder
if china's at all behind it whether they
thought of it
i have to wonder
because china is more ethnically similar
give me a fact check on that i think so
that feels right so it would be an
advantage to them if they could get our
melting pot to fall apart and it looks
like they're working on that or somebody
is or it's just happening i don't know
but it looks like
it kind of is so corrosive it looks like
it's coming from an enemy it doesn't
look like it's coming from within
um
rachel maddow who's complaining about
fox news saying they're building a
campaign platform
talking about crt as a big topic they're
building a campaign platform for
conservative candidates to run on it
everywhere
and then she says even though it's not
actually taught anywhere
even though it's not a real thing
here's the thing
if she has to hide behind the definition
of the word that's her argument
that i define it differently she's not
even talking about the content or the
reality of it just you know
can i define this as crt or is it just
stuff we say that happens to be in the
same topic and compatible with it
i feel that that's
it's like a sign of knowing you've got
nothing
i mean knowing your gun is empty
basically
and
all the gop has to do
to prove anybody wrong is point to any
example of it and apparently there are
lots of them you know you can find the
doc the school documents that show
pretty clearly
things that look like crt to people who
have not studied crt
so the republicans have this total
winning play here
they can just keep hammering on this crt
thing
and i think it's going to work for a
long time
now there are lots of topics where
people are equally
incentivized on both sides
take abortion
the people who are pro or anti-abortion
are really worked up about it right so
i'm not even sure which way that
which way that works election wise
because people are equally worked up on
both sides
but this is a weird topic because the
crt stuff
totally activates the right
but on the other side there's not really
much traction in other words it's an
unbalanced
topic
it can only be bad for democrats that's
it
it can only be bad
there's no sense where they can
motivate their people to get more crt in
the school
do you see people marching in the
streets yes
more critical race training in the
schools now of course there are plenty
of advocates that's why it exists but in
terms of the energy
i would say the advocates are mostly
people getting paid to be advocates
i don't know that the public cares that
much
but the public republicans sure care
that it's there or some version of it
they don't like
so in terms of a political topic it
could not be more perfect
for the
for the republicans going forward
and uh i think rachel maddow is correct
that fox news
either accidentally or wisely
decided that this was going to be the
winning issue and they basically created
a topic
that every republican can win on
and i think that rachel maddow is quite
correct in calling out fox news as
having created a
message and a method that republicans
can use to win
and they would support it with their
platform
all right
i read a fascinating story from a
experienced trucker about what the real
supply chain problem is i'm not sure if
this is different from what you've heard
but he's certainly coming at it a little
differently
it goes like this
the reason that there are not enough
truckers
to take away the stuff
is because the job of being a trucker is
terrible primarily now because of how
long you have to wait
for your truck to be loaded or unloaded
so now you have multi-hour weights in
which the independent truckers don't get
paid you could have an eight-hour wait
to you know get your get your container
on your truck
on top of that apparently there are we
need something like 10 000 specialized
chassis that we don't have
because not every truck can carry a
container you have to have a special
chassis for that and we're apparently
we're way underwater in the number of
chassis
now
why is that
somebody says i told you this for days
i told you this for days
so
why is it that we suddenly don't have
chassis does anybody know
well i think it's because as soon as
things get bunched up everything breaks
at once
we probably had enough chassis when
there wasn't
when there wasn't a big backlog
but as soon as there's a big backlog you
don't have enough chassis
and then if you don't have enough
chassis the backlog just keeps building
up and then you can't do anything so
basically
nobody can move because there aren't
chassis and there aren't truckers to
take things away
but even if there were
they'd have to work 24 hours a day to
move anything
and there are a number of other you know
regulatory problems etc so the
interesting thing about this is it looks
like everything broke at the same time
there's something about this we don't
understand still i feel like this got us
closer but when you say something like
we don't have enough chassis
you have to explain why we had enough
chassis a month ago or whenever this
started why did we have enough chassis
before and suddenly we don't it's not
chassis right
unless
unless we're short just because we have
so much
backup
follow the ownership and the money all
right here's the point that you think
that the trucking companies would fix
this
right economics should work
so the trucking companies should want to
fix this by
kind of raising the salary of truckers
or
doing something but here's the problem
truckers are the trucking companies are
already getting rich because they're
doing all the business that they can
handle
the trucking companies don't need to do
anything
they're also busy making money
that they have more business than they
can handle
so do they have any incentive to do
anything well yeah i mean more money is
better
but if you're making money like crazy
and you're fully busy and you can't hire
new truckers you're not really thinking
in terms of expanding you're just you're
just going to chase the money while you
can
so we have this weird set of problems
that all happen simultaneously to create
an economic incentive where nobody can
do anything
nobody has the economic incentive
to change things enough
they all have an economic incentive to
make it better
but nobody individually not the trucking
companies not the shippers not the
container makers nobody has enough
economic incentive apparently
to like do something big and you'd have
to do something big
yeah and i was also wondering it's kind
of a big coincidence that we had this
problem at the same time we're talking
about decoupling from china because
that's suspiciously convenient isn't it
you know one of the things i tell you
about fake news
is that it's too convenient
this is a little
a little too convenient to the
decoupling story
but could be a coincidence i won't rule
it out but it's a little convenient
all right
climate change summit uh turned into a
joke with their private jets and i guess
60 of their meals had beef and dairy
which is not cool apparently if you're
attending a climate change summit china
didn't even go
so what was the point of the climate
change summit
if china didn't go russia didn't go
the people who attended went in and
private jets and they ate
food that they would not recommend for
the world
i think this turned into a complete
disaster right
i think this is the moment that the
world realized it's a fraud
when
now uh climate change is real in my
opinion
meaning that humans are you know making
the planet warmer at some rate i'm less
alarmed than other people are but i
think the basic science probably right
so the climate change summit which i
think was supposed to be positive pr
for getting something done
turned into the opposite didn't it
didn't show us for sure
that it's a hoax
because if the people who were flying in
these private jets
were even a little bit serious about it
they'd be living it to model it you know
they'd be they'd be leading us by
modeling it they wouldn't be leading us
by taking private jets
to talk to each other
um
yeah so i think this is a huge
failure
i mean that's about it big as you can
get
here's my idea and another somebody
else's idea for reparations you ready
uh first idea is instead of giving 450
000 to each immigrant you could give
each immigrant who was separated at the
border under trump
one hunter biden painting worth 450 000
anybody have a problem with that plan
now i know it would keep hunter busy for
a while but that's part of the benefit
of the plan
keep them away from the rest of people
right
yeah
one hunter by painting to every person
who
got separated at the border
apparently somebody else had that idea
before i did but i don't know who it was
uh here's my idea for reparations
and first i'll give you uh
raul davis's idea so on twitter raul
davis who who you should follow
so look for raul davis ceo branding
expert he'll pop right up
and he said he tweeted the government
should create an nft that's a little
digital piece of art
uh an nft reparations fund
half proceeds to go to black reparations
get together the top white liberal
actors artists and business leaders
they should all be willing to provide
nft artwork for the government program
it's not a bad idea
is it all the people who want
reparations the famous ones they could
create a little piece of art
and just sell it
and then the proceeds
go to some kind of reparations fund but
i'm gonna i'm gonna take it
one step further are you ready to have
your mind blown
ready
i'm gonna blow your mind
we are and i think you'd agree and
facebook certainly agrees transitioning
as a
species
from a sort of organic species into a
better verse
digital virtual reality species true or
false do you accept the premise might be
20 years might be 30 years but do you
expect do you accept the premise that
we're guaranteed to be spending a lot of
time in the multiverse
maybe not your generation but the one
after
i'm going to say yes
stay with me here don't don't argue the
assumptions yet
now if we believe that uh
black americans were highly
disadvantaged in the real world because
of slavery and then systemic racism that
grows from that
what would be the one time in human
history we could fix that
see where i'm going
you could you could make the reparations
in the metaverse
you could give every black american
who uh would be let's say the recipient
of reparations if we were to do
reparations you could give them digital
uh assets
that would have actual monetary value
when they entered the metaverse
so every black american who signs up for
the metaverse whether it's
zuckerberg's version or another one
gets automatic a digital payment and
they start with an advantage
what do you think
here's here's another way to do it
now would this be fair no of course not
it wouldn't be fair
but
i i'd have a conversation about it i
mean i'd at least talk about it
here's another version
give every uh black american in the form
of reparations uh some when
tokens
now the when is my own and my
uh x startups
token the startup is gone but the
uh the token remains because they live
forever on the blockchain you could give
everybody a bunch of when tokens or some
other crypto but i'll just pick my own
and then just say to people hey
if uh
if you'd like reparations to be a thing
buy some when for yourself
because if you buy one for yourself just
as a speculation or investment i
wouldn't call it an investment
speculation if you buy it for yourself
you can make some money if it goes up
you can lose some money if it goes down
but if it goes up
and just the fact that you bought it
should make the when tokens that the
black owners of it have go up in value
so you could simply make yourself rich
and also
black americans who got reparations rich
simply by investing in it
now again it's not really an investment
because crypto i don't consider an
investment
what about it
who loses
nobody right nobody loses because
there's a whole bunch of when tokens you
could just give a bunch away and say all
right everybody gets one when
and then say if you want people to have
reparations buy some when you'll make
money too because yours might go up at
the same time
not guaranteed
but if it does
suddenly black americans have a nice
little uh
little pot of crypto that they can turn
into real cash
so those are my ideas and raul raul's
ideas as well and i don't know that
these are good ideas i like to put out
the bad idea version and then maybe that
makes somebody think well that's a bad
idea but if you change this part it
might work
that's usually the
philosophy with which i do this all
right
that is all i have to do
to talk about today
and i will talk to you
