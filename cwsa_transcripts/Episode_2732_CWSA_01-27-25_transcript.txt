it's popping all around so we'll see how
it

so I can see what you're up
to good
morning can't keep a good man
down or me either
one good man or me hold on
all right here we go
[Music]
[Music]
perfect good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and you've never had a
better time in your life especially
since you missed it yesterday Oho you've
got a whole bunch of pen up coffee
enjoyment coming up it's going to be
better than normal if you'd like to take
it up to levels that nobody can even
understand when they're tiny shiny human
brains all you need is a CER marro glass
a tanker chel Stein a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparallel oh wait I said
that man it was a tough few
days who knows what's going to happen
sip this
well let's start by explaining the
mystery of where I was for the last day
I know it's very very unusual for me to
miss a day of work very unusual so if I
do you can you can assume I'm either
dead or in bad shape luckily I'm not
dead but I know the worst thing that you
could ever hear is somebody describing
their health problems but mine were kind
of funny so I just have to tell you
anyway so about a few weeks ago I had
this problem where I had some kind of
stomach flu not sure what it
was and at the same time by terrible
luck I had this severe injury that I
didn't know where it came from that
affected my left hip so that I couldn't
even walk and it was just screaming pain
whenever I walked so I had two problems
at the same time either one individually
would have be like the worst thing that
happened to you but boy you put them to
together and that's a bad time now this
was a few weeks
ago then the other day on Friday I get
that stomach flew back you know with all
with all the shakes and aches and pains
and everything
bad and my other leg my other
leg got the problem that had now healed
from the first time so how in the world
do I get two probably either Corona
virus or virus us or Nora virus whatever
it doesn't matter how in the world do I
get it twice in a
row that's
combined with the exact injury except
it's the other leg how's that even
possible well I finally figured out what
it
was the leg problem is because the way I
was sleeping so apparently when I laid
on my side I do something with my leg
that puts it in a bad position so when I
wake up I'm in screaming pain and it
takes just hours or sometimes days to
get a normal so I can even just walk so
yesterday I couldn't put anything in my
body which meant that I couldn't have
coffee or anything
else so I've got a coffee
headache I've got all the symptoms of a
flu and I've got screaming pain in one
of my legs now when I say screaming I
mean actually
literally you it would have been bad to
be my neighbor because about every hour
I'd wake up and scream
oh with every
step now you're saying to yourself
that's really bad that's really bad so
I'm I'm I'm uncopied I'm sick and and I
need a
banana because I think a banana is the
only thing I could possibly get down
sometimes you just know what you might
be able to eat and I think if I get the
banana I can get the coffee on top of it
maybe and it wouldn't be so bad and then
I'd at least feel better and I'm like
all right I need a banana so I limped to
my kitchen oh oh oh with every step and
for the one time this is very rare I
Have No Bananas I almost always have a
banana it's like my most basic thing I
keep so I go to order one to be
delivered not one you know bunch of
bananas so I get on Amazon
to get my banana because I'm so out of
it that I couldn't tell the difference
between Amazon and door Dash I confuse
them because they both bring groceries
to me but I forgot the Amazon is the one
that brings it to you the next
day no I needed it right away I need
that banana I really need a banana so I
I get on Amazon I'm like oh banana how
interface wait and I and I put some
stuff in a basket and then it
disappeared
and I'm in some other mode because I
guess Amazon has more than one way to
buy groceries that somehow can mixed up
the two ways so every time I would add
something and then I think I was done
I'd be ready to send there would be no
send button there was no buy button and
then I'd end up in some other mode and I
so I think Amazon has at least three
different ways to buy groceries so I
couldn't figure it out but I finally
figured it out and put in the order and
then it tells me it's going to be there
tomorrow and I'm like what oh
sh I'm on Amazon I need door Dash so I'd
already ordered it so now I've got a
bunch of stuff coming that I don't
need that should be sometime
today but I'm like so I go back to Door
Dash I go all right and I try to order
bananas and then something went wrong
because my brain wasn't working again
but I I successfully put it in the order
and I have to wait if few hours I'm like
oh if only that banana would come my
everything would start getting better if
I could get the banana I just need one
banana that's all I need finally door
Dash comes he delivers my
bananas except apparently I had somehow
ordered one
banana that's right now I know the
difference between a bunch and a single
banana and I was pretty sure I hit the
bunch but apparently I hit the single
banana so I got one
banana which would have been enough
except it was
green so that's like no
banana so I said damn it I am not going
to be beaten so I suffer through trying
to figure out how to order properly
again second door Dash right after the
first one and finally I'm happy to
report that after all that banana
business I finally got a nice bunch of
banana
bananas they were all green so I still
had no
bananas so that was my third attempted
banana delivery all failures but I had
some other fruit that that was along
with it got back in the got back in it
so I thought to myself if I could just
wait this out like the other time that
one of my legs was in screaming pain and
I had a flu like symptoms you know I
knew I weighed it out it's just really
painful just weighed it out and then I
went to sleep
sleep to one of my many naps probably 10
naps that day and I woke up and I had
reinjured my other leg that's right now
I had two legs that gave me screaming
pain anytime I tried to walk basically
totally disabled couldn't stand up
couldn't walk
ow so it just got
worse
anyway but at least I could you know
look at my screens and entertain myself
no there's something about the weird flu
thing that makes it impossible to look
at a screen like I tried but every time
I did it's like oh headache oh so it was
about the worst two days you could ever
have but I'm back I can barely walk but
it'll be fine we're we're 80% better
let's talk about Ben and Jerry's so Ben
and Jerry who are no longer directly
associated with Ben and Jerry it's owned
owned by Unilever I believe
but the the Ben and Jerry themselves
have going full woke and maybe the
company too and uh so they're so they
just dropped a Dei themed ad declaring
they'll never stop fighting to dismantle
white supremacy and end the climate
crisis now are you all having this Trump
uh time Distortion thing that I am where
it seems like Trump must have been pre
president this time for already a year
because he's done so much like like time
doesn't make sense anymore but here's
another
one doesn't it sound like this didn't
come from this era when you hear that
somebody wants to dismantle white
supremacy which two months ago was sort
of
normal but now it just feels like what
what are you from the
past am I the only one having that
feeling that that that somehow just even
reading it like really dismantle was
Supremacy what year is this it's not
2025 Is
It Anyway my question to Ben and Jerry's
is do they still sell
vanilla because I feel like that's a
little bit way supremacist
vanilla you should get rid of
vanilla but uh here's what I think is
going to happen whether it's Ben and
Jers or Costco or somebody else it seems
to me that somebody is going to buy one
share in their parent company uh unil
lever which is a uh it's a it's not a US
company so you'd have to buy something
called an ADR but I think you can do it
I think it works I'm not positive so
maybe Ben and Jerry's isn't the the
first place to start but what's going to
happen is some shareholder is going to
buy one
share just to press them on the Dei and
they're going to say I'm suing you for
these policies that are clearly bad for
stockholders because now that the
government under Trump has declared that
Dei is literally
racist how can a company keep doing it
without being accused of literally being
racist so it's pretty big risk for all
the companies sooner or later somebody's
going to sue one of them and say you
better get rid of this now that it's
government approved or not government
approved but government labeled
racism it's pretty risky to have that
still going on if you've got
stockholders as Cory d'angelus points
out in a article in Fox News uh the next
place for Trump to ban Dei would be the
schools the schools need to stop the Dei
now I assume even though the schools are
mostly locally run that the government
has enough influence through funding or
something else that they could ban it in
schools
that's really really important because
if we don't kill it in
school we're dead because it'll just be
another generation of Dei
idiots so yeah Cory d'angelus is right
on this one school's got to be next in
colleges
too I was watching Mark andreon I think
he was talking to LAX
fredman and uh I am so impressed with
Mark andreon
um let's
say um trans what would you say I think
he's emerging from a business leader
to um maybe a social and political
leader but I knew he was
smart Mark
Andre but I didn't know how smart he was
and now that I'm listening to him talk
oh my God my God he's smart like just
crazy smart and he's smart in exactly
the way the country needs which is he
can explain the most complicated things
in the simplest completely
understandable ways and he seems to have
priorities straight Etc now I didn't
realize that he was he was advising
Trump I don't know if he's advising him
on specific topics or more generally I'm
not sure but wow when you hear that
Trump is being advised by you know Elon
Musk Mark
Andre you know like it this is
crazy this is the best advice any human
ever received like how are we so lucky
it's amazing but anyway one of the
things Mark andrion said he was dumping
on Larry Fink the uh the head of Black
Rock and he said he said that Larry Fink
fell for every idea in the
world those are that's his words of
course I'm much too nice to you that RW
but I'm quoting because apparently it's
semi- approved at the moment so he was
he was saying that the Dei and the ESG
and and the zero point whatever so
uh yeah i' love to see a hugely
important business figure just take a
big old right on Black Rock and
Larry fing head just say and just call
him out as being basically an idiot who
who has not been helping and it's
probably been greatly hurting and doing
it on the backs of the
shareholders
um both in his company and
otherwise so that's a good that's good
uh as you know tulsy gabard is is up for
the dni job head of dni she has to be
confirmed and uh over on MSNBC we're
watching uh we're watching as John
Brennan is saying what a bad pick she
would be for the dni
now as other people noted and I often
tell you if you know the story you don't
know anything if you know the players
well you might know a lot and this is
one of those if all you knew is that
somebody used to had the CIA said that
telsey gabard was not was not the right
one for the job you'd say oh well that
that's a very qualified person and a
serious qualified person at that
so if somebody's serious and qualified
says she's not good for the job you're
like H huh well I should take that
pretty
seriously
however if you know the
players looks pretty different doesn't
it and most of you who are listening
know the players by now John Brennan
he's the guy who pushed the Russia
collusion and the the hunter laptop
letter he
he's he is the signal of what you should
do the opposite of and the fact that he
appears on MSNBC to spew his stuff uh as
uh as somebody on X who goes by the name
gofun gofun gon says quote I love MSNBC
they give us insight into what the
intelligence agencies want us to
believe well not not the agencies in
general but certainly some elements of
them and the worst ones I think
so yes that's exactly what I do when I
watch MSNBC I watch it for the the humor
because it's so stupid literally I watch
it for the humor
and the other thing is that it does
signal to you what the dark intelligence
people want you to believe that isn't
true so it's really useful again if he
didn't know the players you would just
turn it on and you think it was news and
then you'd say oh there's some news but
if you know that they seem to be and I
don't know the details but seems to
be
um all right I might have to turn off
the comments here but we we'll see how
it goes I'll tell you what I'll just
cover the comments with the locals
people that way I don't have to look at
them all
right um so I can still see the comments
but just locals th those of you are
being bad in the comments don't be bad
anymore all
right
um big question for me is when do all
the NOS get defunded is that going to
happen this week now the ngos are the
non-government
organizations which I thought was sort
of a limited sort of thing not that big
but you know they had something to do
with I don't know some secret plan for
censoring America ANS and they seem to
be deeply involved in assisting illegal
immigration and lots of people say
they're some of them are involved in you
know child trafficking sex
trafficking and the only thing I know
for sure
is why are there so many of them and why
do they cost so much and why are we
funding them it couldn't possibly be a
good idea so I'm pretty sure that nearly
all of these need to be shut down
immediately because they seem to be
working against the interests of America
while we're funding them how in the
world did we get in a situation where
we're funding these unlimited number of
of entities that are actually trying to
seemingly I mean if you just looked at
what they're doing it looks like they're
trying to destroy America how in the
world are we letting that go on I I've
got a feeling that Trump's getting ready
to put the hammer down and
[Music]
that
um yesterday apparently Elon Musk
suggested tongue and cheek that the
English Channel the the water between
England and France should be renamed to
the George Washington
Channel now uh I I saw one commenter who
was terribly incensed that he would
suggest that the English Channel would
be renamed to the George Washington
Channel how do you not know he's
joking how does somebody read that and
not know that's obviously just a
meme think about what it would be like
to be one of the people who doesn't know
how jokes work like I don't know that
looks real to me anyway that's
funny well Trump is pushing his idea of
a tariff funed economy instead of just
taxes I don't see any way that he could
get to a tariff only economy but if it
got to a point where
taxes didn't have to go up because
tariffs were handling it maybe but you
know if there's tariffs also your
expenses go up so I don't know how to
net that out I'm not sure if anybody
does but it it is true that we used to
have a tariff funded economy when things
were
simpler um and it could be that it's
easier to raise taxes than it is to
raise tariffs because all the obvious
reasons makes harder to get stuff
there'll be retaliation Etc and then you
have the the separate problem that if
you just become the Tariff
country uh wouldn't it cause other
people to you know find a work arounds
and not sell things to you or would it
cause people
to um there there would be some
confusion if you tried to use it as a
weapon if it was also your normal way of
doing business but I suppose you could
still crank it up if you wanted to turn
it into a weapon so I guess I would say
I'm not 100% sure this is a good idea
but I know that doing what we we have
been doing is a bad idea because what we
have been doing is heading toward a
cliff so we better do something and uh I
would be way more open
to more open to let's say
non-standard and even big changes than I
would have been ordinarily so I don't
know I'd love to see somebody smarter
tell me if this a good idea or a bad
idea to have a tariff funed
economy well Trump is signing uh going
to sign some executive order on
developing AI that is free from IDE
ideological bias so AP news is reporting
that now I don't know what that
means um apparently Trump wants to
remove you know any burdensome
government
oversight but uh and we would ALS he
also wants to get rid of the racism
that's built into the current AIS
anti-white racism
primarily
[Music]
um and this would be good presumably to
help America uh have ai leadership I'm
not sure if we have that right now but
it would' be in better
shape and uh yeah so Trump says we must
develop AI systems that are free from
ideological bias or engineered social
agendas
and we also want it free from red tape I
wonder
though does I think what Biden had in
mind was everything had to run past the
government before it was approved to be
U
released and I wonder if that helped at
all or even would help in the future I
don't know that the the argument for not
having the government get involved is
pretty strong because wherever that
wherever we did it it seems to work
better than whenever the governments
involved how in the world could the
government evaluate
AI that doesn't even seem like make
sense does it like do you think the the
best people are going to be looking at
the AI algorithms in the
government I don't
know so getting the government out of
that seems to make more sense than not
um at one point it seems so dangerous
that we couldn't release AI without you
know the government oversight but now
that there are going to be so many AIS
from so many different places we'll talk
about that um I don't think there's any
way to stop AI so if the only thing we
do is our own
Industries but there's going to be the
same amount of AI out there no matter
what because it'll just come from other
places this makes sense to me to get it
does make sense to get rid of the uh
regulations uh yeah somebody said that
David Sachs might be the adviser on this
one so I would trust him
um you may have seen a clip of Bill Mah
on uh on his show
uh what's he called his show um not real
time the one he does in his man cave
there with Matt
Gates
and this was really frustrating to me
because uh Bill Mah got into the January
6th thing and wanted to you know really
nail Matt Gates on it now Gates of
course is one of the best
communicators in the game and knows a
lot about the January 6 stuff of course
so this was like so interesting to me
I'm like oh finally somebody's going to
give a good argument to Bill Maher about
the January 6 because it's never been
done it's never been done nobody capable
has ever explained January 6 to a
Democrat I've never it and I thought
finally you know you you've got a super
staric
Communicator um this is good and then
Gates made the mistake that is
unrecoverable in terms of a
debate he went your side does it
too that's that's the losing argument
let me tell you why and this is exactly
the way it went with uh with maren Gates
basically I'll just summarize this this
is not their exact word but the way it
went was Bill Mar said January 6 was bad
you know blah blah blah January 6
Insurrection bad Matt Gat said but you
realize the Democrats have also
questioned a lot of Elections he's
already lost the arguments lost at that
point you can't win because then Mar
says yes but they're they're not
equivalent and then this is what the
Democrats do Bill Mor said and if you
say they are equivalent you're a
hack that's right he didn't say the
argument is better this way he said if
you make that argument you're hack and
then then Mara started getting really
mad and talking over him like he
couldn't possibly listen to any
explanation but to be fair to be fair
gas's argument was
terrible and I hate to say it but
getting all over a terrible argument
isn't isn't a mistake it was a terrible
argument say you do it too cuz it wasn't
equivalent I mean you you can't compare
you know what happened on January 6 to
somebody saying I'm not sure this was a
fair election you know or or challenging
it in the courts these are not
equivalent right so let me tell you how
to win this
argument you you lose from the first
moment unless you establish the
following thing here's the way I do it
if it were me I would said you know Bill
I'm sure you're aware that there are two
narratives there's your narrative and
then I would explain it so that it was
clear I understood it your narrative is
it was an Insurrection they're trying to
overthrow the country and importantly
importantly they knew they lost the
election so that's that's bills
narrative then always said I'm not sure
you're aware of what the other narrative
is because it doesn't really come
through and the other narrative is there
is no way to know who won any
election and if you think that Trump
knew that he lost you'd have to explain
why half of the country didn't know it
because they thought that the election
looked rigged they saw too many
irregularities now they could have been
wrong but they were operating under the
assumption that the election had been
stolen and if they were operating under
that they were operating as Patriots
meaning that they were trying to fix
something that had gone terribly wrong
now when look at the American Revolution
the reason that we don't um we don't get
mad at the American revolutionaries for
the violence they created violence they
started it is because they had a good
reason and they were seeking freedom and
Independence and uh if you win then you
get to be the good guys in right history
and say that that violence was totally
justified so the thing you have to sell
is the idea that nobody can tell an
election is fair
now what would happen if you said that
well if you're a Democrat they will
start yelling at you that you're a hack
so you're going to have to somehow
settle them down enough so you can
explain you know there's there's no way
to know that any American election is
fair there really isn't the only thing
you can know is it's complicated other
people were involved and maybe somebody
told you it was fair but in order to
think that the American election systems
are fair you would have to say that
they're the only thing in America that
is because we've seen over the last few
years quite vividly Department of
Justice was lawfare FBI was totally
corrupt at the leadership level we've
seen that our Health Care system was
completely messed up during pandemic
we've seen that science is a
mess there's as much fraud as there is
science in the in the science itself and
you could just go down the line every
part from you know we just talked about
NOS almost every part of American
institutions are clearly obviously
corrupt but the elections are not the
most complicated things that you and I
couldn't possibly look into you're
telling me that that nobody could hack
an election it's the only unhackable
system in the
world these are ridiculous assumptions
so if you want to win the j6 thing don't
talk about j6 talk about whether
elections can be known who
won you can't you and don't leave that
place because if you're arguing about
whether it's good it's good or bad to be
fighting against
cops don't get into that argument if if
you're trying to save a country it's
good right if you're trying to overthrow
a country it's bad so you don't even
have to talk about what happened on
January 6 because it all depends on what
you think they were doing now have you
noticed that it's been how many years
now since January 6 four years
so four years from January 6 and we've
seen
exactly zero interviews with a January
sixer who thought the election was
real
none none 1,500 people went to jail not
one of them has said you know once I
realized the election was really real
and fair I guess I see what bad things I
did not
one do do you think that Trump really
believed that was a fair
election if I had been in his place I
don't think I would have now I don't
know if it was fair or not I just know
that nobody else knows and it looked it
looked like it was sending the signals
that it was
rigged you know if you go if you go to
bed and you're winning and you wake up
and you
lost and you and something like I don't
remember the number is it 18 out 19
bellweather went the wrong direction if
your bell weathers go the wrong
direction and there's a last minute come
from behind hard to explain when yeah
that's every signal in the world beyond
that you don't even have to see the
signals if you know that the other side
had been saying that they're trying to
stop Hitler and you see what things they
did to try to stop what they thought was
Hitler rigging an election would be the
least dramatic thing the lawfare is way
worse than rigging the election way
worse so we know they did things way
worse than rigging election that's
pretty established so rigging election
would just be normal business if they
really thought they were stopping
Hiller you probably heard this story on
if you're on X but uh I I saw a post by
Stephanie Tyler and she describes the
following so there are a number of older
books that that are hard to explain
their existence unless time travel is
real or we live in a simulation so
courtesy of Stephanie Tyler I will
summarize a little bit so it starts like
this Nicola Tesla dies so back when
Tesla was the man he dies and the only
person allowed to access is safe the one
containing all his most secret
inventions is somebody named John G
Trump a a brilliant MIT scientist and oh
by coincidence Donald Trump's
Uncle who who conveniently says Ah
there's nothing to see in
there now if this if this were the only
coincidence it would be really weird
wouldn't it what are the odds that
Nicola Tesla dies and Donald Trump's
uncle is the one who has access to his
secrets that's so weird but it gets
weirder in 1958 there was a something
called track down I think that must have
been a TV show featuring a con man named
Walter Trump and Walter Trump was trying
to sell people a magic wall to save them
from the end of the
world okay now what are the odds that
there would be a book about somebody
named Trump who really wants a
wall okay that's a coincidence too but
we're not
done 1953 uh wner Von braa you the head
of the
rocket program uh the father of rocket
science published a book about humans
colonizing Mars led by a guy named
Elon Elon e l n so the guy that the
father of rockets thought would be the
leader on Mars was named
Elon okay it gets weirder in the even
before that in the
1890s uh ingol Lo wood author writes
about a story about Baron
Trump that's the actual name Baron Trump
a kid from the a kid from quote Castle
Trump going on wild adventures with a
guide named
Dawn
what uh and then writes a book called
the last president where chaos breaks
out in America after the election of an
outsider what
and
then
um so and then you fast forward to now
we have Elon Musk who runs a company
named Tesla named after Tesla and is
obsessed with getting us to Mars and is
not only working with Trump but quite
literally got him elected and and has
even visited his magic wall that's what
Stephanie Tyler says this is really good
thread by the way
Stephanie uh how is any of that real e
even Elon when he commented about the
person leading Mars named Elon even Elon
said how is this real how how could it
possibly be
real now I'll tell you how it could be
real think of all the books that have
ever been
written all the books that have ever
been written don't you think that if you
could search all the books that have
ever been written you would find a whole
bunch of these these meaning not just
stuff about Tesla or Elon but a whole
bunch of
coincidences hey that book predicted
this and that book predicted that and
the answer is this is like the Bible
Code remember when there was a I always
use this example because it's so good uh
there was a claim that there were secret
patterns in the Bible that if you just
did things like look at these second
letter of every sentence and you know
stuff like that that there would be a
secret message predicting the future and
there were a bunch of them whole bunch
of them in the Bible and then somebody
had the idea to run the same algorithm
against War and Peace just random book
and it was full of codes so you could
take any book that's a a good size and
you can find a whole bunch of
coincidences that appear to predict the
future and I think this is one of those
situations where instead of looking at
all the sentences and big book you're
looking at all the
books and if you could selectively pick
just the books you wanted to show people
probably this is one of you know
thousands of different amazing
coincidences you could artificially
create or we're part of a simulation
pick one all right well the big news of
course is moving the markets is this uh
Chinese AI called Deep seek now some of
you watching this are going to say I do
not care about this
technology but this one's really
important this isn't like just a nerdish
story this is civilization altering kind
of
stuff and I think there's still some
mystery about how it was developed but
the uh the things we know is that they
somehow China got a hold of uh a bunch
of Nvidia chips that they weren't
supposed to have access to because they
would be denied to our adversarial
countries but somehow they got them and
but they didn't get many compared to how
many the United States has for its big
AI produ uh
projects um but they had enough combined
with some really clever
engineering that they buil something
that's just as good as the big
AIS now the big part of the story is
that they innovated Way Beyond what the
experts were expecting and
faster it
wasn't beyond what I expected because I
literally predicted that this was going
to happen that there would be a super
cheap alternative that would pop up and
that it would hurt Nvidia stock which is
why I told you a while ago that I sold
my Nvidia stock is because I was
expecting a fairly
quickly um a competitor now you might
say Scott how in the world did you guess
this when seemingly nobody else was
guessing it when I have no skills
whatsoever in this domain and the answer
is just pattern recognition and
economics so if you have a background in
economics it helps but when you see this
many dollars involved the the AI dollars
are beyond anything we've seen really so
there's immense amount of money involved
but also if you don't get in the AI game
soon enough and you're a big country
it's an existential risk so you're
essentially engineering for your
life if you put people in the situation
of engineering for their life to try to
save their country you're going to do
better than somebody who's just working
for money in the United States we have
great Engineers obviously or we wouldn't
have the AI that we have
but they're largely working for money
and they're you're under the impression
that they're leading in Ai and maybe
they are um that's a completely
different incentive and I would argue
that Wars have taught us that when you
get in a war The Innovation goes to the
roof because you're trying to live so
when you're engineering yourself to try
to survive suddenly you get really
clever and you've seen this a million
times in a million different contexts so
given the amount of money involved and
that it's an existential risk to China
and other countries I predicted that
somebody would find a really clever
engineering workaround and they would do
it pretty quickly and it happened it
happened almost exactly when I thought
it would you know not long after I sold
the stock and so what we know right now
is I want to tell you a little bit this
might be a little too nerdy for you but
I'll try to make it interesting I saw a
post by Morgan Brown who was in the AI
space this was on X describing what they
got right so let me just run through
this so and by the way again if you
think this is a nerd story about some
technology you're missing the big point
this is everything if if this thing is
real and it can compete with the big
expensive
AIS we're in a lot of
trouble yeah America just went from
dominance to uh oh like just overnight
so let me give you the rundown so you're
educated on this um first of all in
America at the moment if you were one of
those uh regular AIS like open AI or
anthropic it might cost you a hundred
million just on Computer Resources uh to
train something hundred
million uh and they need massive data
centers and thousands of gpus that cost
40,000 a
piece but if you were uh this little
it's called Deep seek that's the name of
the new AI the cheap one it only costs
them $5
million so five instead of 100 million
and it can match or in some ways I guess
beat the current version of uh the open
AI product and some others a little
better than some others and they
rethought everything from the ground up
so here's some examples traditional
AI uh likes to write everything with 32
decimal places the cheap one said what
if we just use eight decimal places and
to be close enough
and it uses 75% less memory so they gain
75% of memory just by saying huh we
could just take a little off of this be
a little less fewer fewer decimal
places uh then there's some kind of
multi- toen system so normal AI reads
like a first grader it reads sort of in
order the cat sat so it sees each word
in order um one at a time apparently
this new one the cheap one reads whole
phrases at once so if it reads a whole
phrase just like it something else would
read one word at a time if it reads
whole phrase apparently it's two times
faster and 90% is
accurate now do you know what they
copied that's speed
reading they they put speed reading into
the model I think I've described before
because I learned speed reading when I
was a kid you don't look at words you
look at the sentence and you brain picks
out the important words in the sentence
and instead of going ba baah ba each
word you just look at it and you just
know what it says now it takes practice
but obviously the AI can get it a lot
faster so it's basically treating a
sentence like a
word and then it became much more
proficient here's another
trick uh they built an expert system
instead of one massive AI trying to know
everything so apparently it has lots of
expertise built in but it only wakes up
to you know to use the technical term it
only wakes up the expert in needs so
it's not always looking every expert at
everything it just wakes up the part of
the model that's relevant to the
question I
guess
um and traditional models have 1.8
trillion parameters active all the time
whereas this cheap one has only uh 37
billion active at once so that's a big
difference
all right so here's the results so
instead of costing 100 million to train
it's 5 million instead of uh instead of
needing 100,000 gpus it might need less
than 2,000 the API costs are 95% cheaper
and it can run on a regular computer a
high-end computer but one that you could
buy for gaming Etc so that's a big deal
um it's all open
source which is why stocks and the other
companies are
falling and let's
see and they don't need a billion dollar
data
center Etc all right and apparently deep
seek did it with a team of fewer than
200
people and I I read something else
separately this is not from Stephanie or
Morgan but uh separately I saw that they
did something where they cleverly
trained it with incentives and a way
better than regular AI
but anyway those are things you need to
know lots of clever clever engineering
but when you see how clever the
engineering
was that's the difference between
engineering for your life and just
engineering because it seems to me that
every one of these clever moves were
available to all of our AI people
weren't they but I think our AI people
were saying no we you know we have to
hit the maximum so instead of saying
well if I cut some Corners it'll be 90%
as good I I think the American way is
it's got to be the best
one now what are the odds what are the
odds that uh this cheap one will destroy
the entire AI industry in the United
States I think low and here's why I
think Nvidia won't fall to zero um it'll
take a hit and I think it'll just it'll
just make it back eventually during the
year my guess is that Nvidia is still a
good stock that's my guess but you know
I would just be guessing so don't don't
buy it because I said
so there's definitely a bigger risk than
there was last week so if you if you
think Nvidia is the same stock as it was
a week ago it's definitely not
definitely not the same stock it was a
week ago but that doesn't mean it's in
trouble here's why um as the experts say
the very next version of open Ai and and
our other AIS will probably be better
than this deep seek will deep seek be
able to keep up we don't know we're GNA
have to see it might it might be such a
fast follower that nothing we can do
gets out of it but we'll have to find it
out the other thing I think is that um
and I've been waiting for this I think
the government I don't know if a trump
government would do it but I think the
government is going to make it hard for
other AIS to compete you remember Mark
andreon told us he was in a meeting in
which uh some intelligence people said
to the AI uh AI tech people uh don't
bother don't don't bother funding more
AIS because we're only going to let a
few big ones survive in the United
States so we can basically have control
over it well I feel like there will be
artificial barriers put in place that
might even make it illegal to use this
open source one I mean it may be as
simple as that here here's what I
predict
in Fairly short order somebody's going
to find some code in that deep seek
thing because remember it's open that
looks
suspicious or or it has a back door
somehow or or it's got some kind of
thing that isn't completely predictable
and then the rumor will start and it
might not be true but the rumor will
start that it's like a virus and you
can't let it free in America and it
might not be true but the government and
of caution will say all right we're
going to ban it you can't use this cheap
one because you know we're not sure it's
good we're not sure it's safe so I kind
of expect that to happen so if you add
the fact that the us is going to try to
stay ahead and you know we don't know if
deep seek can reach uh the next level of
we don't even know if it can reach the
next Lev of AI which is Agi you know
more of a general
intelligence um but we also don't know
if the American companies can they say
they're going to be there by you know
two years but I'm not so sure so we'll
see so lots of questions about this but
it doesn't mean the end of uh the end of
AI in
America now I make similar predictions
now you probably wonder why do I keep
talking about Battery Technology and the
reason is it's the same as this
AI I'm I'm expecting a huge breakthrough
in Battery Technology
because the stakes are so high the
dollar amounts would be gigantic and it
would be World transforming if we could
just make batteries let's
say 20 times better you know pick a
number uh it would change everything and
sure enough every day there's a new
breakthrough I I don't think any one of
these are necessarily going to be the
one but now there's a according to
interesting engineering there's a new
aluminum battery that contains over 99%
of its capacity after 10,000 Cycles now
that's that's doesn't mean that that's
going into production anytime soon but
that's a Cy that's the scale of
improvements that people are looking at
in batteries I think you could make the
same prediction with batteries that I
made with AI so much money involved so
much at stake that somebody's going to
engineer some kind of battery that you
just get blown away by so something you
didn't even think was possible I think
it's
coming according to the amuse account on
X the uh Trump Administration is going
to go after uh trying to figure out
where the billions that were sent to
Ukraine ended up so the FBI and the doj
they launched this big investigation
into where it
went and I think we're going to find out
some terrible things about where all
that money went it definitely didn't all
go to you know useful weapons and stuff
we'll find out in other news the new CIA
director
Ratliff uh is going to have the CIA
evaluate if China intentionally started
the pandemic according to the Daily wire
now did China intentionally start the
pandemic here's where they could save a
lot of time and money in the CIA by
simply asking
me Scott did China intentionally release
a virus in their own major
city
no and we're done here now a lot of
people have been giving me a hard time
about this on X today after I said it on
X and people saying Scott Scott how do
you explain X how do you explain Y how
do you explain this other thing to which
I say I don't have
to nobody releases a deadly virus in
their own City first if they have a
clever plan to take down the rest of the
world a clever plan to take care take
down the rest of the world would be
releasing it
in
Chicago now that would be a good plan or
London that would be a good plan or or
better yet multiple places at once but
all of them ones who don't have a big
connection to China directly nobody
nobody releases a virus a deadly virus
in their own country to take down other
countries nobody ever ever ever now the
response I got to that is Scott you
don't understand that China doesn't
value human
life okay I don't want to go all woke on
you but that's just
racist that's not an opinion that's just
racist because even if you said they
didn't value human life and they do they
do value human life I'm not going to I'm
not going to accept Chinese are the only
people who don't value human life that's
ridiculous
um I mean that's really ridiculous but
even if even if they didn't value human
life they wouldn't release it in their
own
City there is no there is no no rational
argument for why they do that and then
somebody else said but they're not
rational yes they are they're like one
of the most rational places ever if they
were if they weren't rational they would
have all already made a move on Taiwan
they would have done everything
different if they weren't rational
everything China does you might not like
it but you can see the glaring you know
Common Sense to it from their their
perspective so no you do not have to
study this nobody releases a deadly
virus in their own City first when you
could release it somewhere
else
um now that we know that the virus came
from the lab and therefore was part of a
weaponization or at least gain a
function which sounds like
weaponization
um this might explain some of the
Mysteries that I had during the
pandemic I was trying to understand
understand why but and the problem is
that I knew it was from the lab from the
first weeks you know I told you friend
of mine showed me the uh Google Map long
before it was in the news uh nobody
nobody in the news had heard of it um he
said you know it's right across the
street from the
Wuhan lab of I don't know what with the
perfect name for exactly this and as
soon as I saw that I was like oh
obviously they're just saying it came
from the wet Market but clearly that
would be too big of a coincidence that
the lab that that does this exact work
is across the street so I knew it was
weaponized uh weaponized or at least
gain a function which would end up
looking like the same thing and so when
people said Scott don't get the shots
it's just a
cold if you thought it was just a cold
it would be ridiculous to get a shot
wouldn't it if it was just a cold why
would you take a chance on a new a new
medicine in the form of a shot that'd be
crazy but if you knew that it was a gain
of function and therefore
unpredictable wouldn't it be at least a
toss
up that if you took some kind of
technology that was designed to minimize
its impact on you the shot now again you
didn't know if it' work you don't know
what the side effects are there's a big
risk we all agree that no matter what
what else it was a it was a risk to take
the shot but it was also pretty big risk
to be completely
unprotected and get a weaponized virus
especially since you didn't know what
the long-term effects were the long
so-called long Co
so um if you thought it was a slam dunk
decision probably you thought it was
also a cold and that means you probably
didn't know that it came from a
weaponized lab but what I'm seeing is
people who knew it came from a a gain of
function lab meaning either accidentally
or intentionally weaponized and you
still said it was a
cold you you must have really not
trusted that lab to make some good stuff
if you thought it was just a cold well
they've been working hard they made the
common cold or something no worse than
the common
cold anyway the hoodies in Yemen that
were disrupting all the ship traffic in
the Red Sea by shooting them with
missiles they said that they're they're
going to stop doing doing that as long
as the ceasefire in Gaza
holds okay apparently the ships that
would use the Red Sea have decided
that's not good enough they don't trust
the hoodies to not attack them and they
shouldn't because I don't think that you
know by the time you send your by the
time you send your ship into the Red Sea
it could be five minutes from the
ceasefire falling apart so yeah it would
be pretty dangerous to assume that
they're not going to shoot you because
of a ceasefire that you know may not
hold
but I really made me wonder is that
really what the hoodies care about the
only thing that they care about is
Gaza did we know that before or are they
just pretending that's the thing they
care about so that they have a reason to
stop doing it I I was pretty sure now
obviously they're backed by Iran so
whatever Iran wants is what the hoodies
are doing but did Iran just say to the
hoodies stand down as long as the
ceasefire holds because that would
almost
suggest that they really mostly cared
about Gaza that doesn't seem completely
right does it so there's something about
this that doesn't add
up um but the first thing that makes me
wonder is apparently Trump has suggested
that uh let me find his exact words here
tropus suggested for Gaza that they
clear out the whole
thing um basically take all the people
in Gaza relocate them temporarily or
permanently and then fix whatever is
Gaza and then decide later if anybody
can come back now that's pretty
dramatic but I think he's talking to
Jordan and Egypt about taking the uh
Gaza res
not that the Gaza residents want to go
to either of those places but where they
are now is probably not so
cool but here's what's wrong with that
Egypt and Jordan are not our
enemies am I
right I mean Egypt and Jordan are sort
of to you know Jordan especially is
somebody we work with all the time why
would we send
Hamas because the Hamas people are a big
part of you know they're going to be
part of the gazin who who are uh moved
anywhere why why would we move a whole
bunch of Hamas Fighters into an ally or
somebody that we at least would like to
work with like Egypt that doesn't make
sense does it wouldn't it make more
sense to tell Iran they have to take
them because Iran's the one that broke
it if you broke it you bought
it I would let me just float this idea
so this is in the context of the bad
idea concept if you haven't heard this
before the bad idea is when you suggest
a bad
idea just to brainstorm and then people
say that's a stupid idea Scott but you
remind me of something that would work
so I'm going to give you the bad idea
the stupid embarrassing one you know
because I I have that superpower I have
no shame so I can I can do embarrassing
ideas that maybe just you think of a
better one and then that's the goal all
right suppose
Trump and I guess Netanyahu say here's
what we want to do Iran is the one who's
backing Hamas Iran is the one who is the
main sponsor Iran is the one that broke
it they're all going to
Iran and then Iran then Iran says whoa
hold on hold on uh we're you know we're
Shia and they're Sunni and you know
doesn't work and we say we don't care
you've been backing them they're yours
so if you want them to have a good life
open up some space in Iran take care of
them yeah you're the one who got us in
this situation it's not ours to fix so
why don't you do something really good
for the Gins and build a really nice
safe place for them in Iran we promise
that if we get in a fight with Iran we
won't even bomb them you know they'll be
nice and safe so Iran why don't you take
him back and here's the thing of course
Iran is going to say no at least in
minute one they're going to say say no
of course they're going to say no but
the framing is kind of smart the framing
would be you broke it you bought it and
that's the end of the
story now would this be a terrible
tragedy to the
Gins
yes it would be a terrible tragedy if
they didn't think they could go back but
I wouldn't rule out that somebody
carefully vetted could come back you
know once Gaza is rebuilt into something
I wouldn't take any of the homas
fighters back but it does seem like you
could probably you know do enough
fetting that some people could come back
just not the Hamas Fighters and maybe
you'd have to I you know it could be
that it would just recreate the problem
so if if we decided never to do that not
we but if they decided never to do that
it wouldn't
be you know unconscionable it would just
be a practical decision
um all right so that's the question we
should tell Iran they have to take them
because it's their problem not anybody
else's um the the chief of the IMF the
international monetary fund over at
Davos I think was saying according to
Breitbart that uh Europe should be more
like the
US and I think this is all from Trump
like you know I don't think they would
have even said this before but uh so the
European economy as you know has lagged
behind the US by quite a bit they've
invented practically nothing and uh so
the head of the IMF said the time has
come for Europe to collectively look
across the Atlantic and follow the US
lead as it grows in confidence daily
under the leadership of President Donald
Trump no I think that's maybe
breitbart's take on it but the actual
quote is the United States has a culture
of confidence Europe has a culture of
modesty georgeva said I guess she's the
head of the IMF uh quote my advice to my
fellow Europeans is more confidence
believe in yourself and most most
importantly tell others that you
do okay do you think that the
problem do you think that the big
problem between Europe and the United
States is
confidence do you think maybe they got
that backwards do you know what would
make Europe
confident winning winning winning makes
you confident you know what makes you
not confident
losing losing to somebody else so could
it be that their real problem is
structural meaning that they have red
tape like crazy they have government in
everybody's pockets they don't have
basically everything's wrong uh they
don't have I don't think they have the
venture capital structure that we have
in this country if you fixed all the
structural wouldn't Europe have success
and wouldn't success make them conf
confident probably I I don't think that
we that America somehow raised a bunch
of confident people independent of
success there are people like me who are
confident before they're
successful but I think I was just born
that way I don't think it has anything
to do with
America don't you think there's some
confidence people being born in Europe
like none what they have some kind of
some kind of weird genetic defect that
affects all the all the nationalities in
all of Europe they all have the low
confidence genetic defect or do the
schools teach them not to be confident
it seems more likely that there's a
structural problem and if they fix that
the confidence would follow but that's
just
speculation
anyway um
what else is
happening according to Michael
shellenberger uh the CIA under Biden
broke the law and not releasing its
analysis of the Wuhan lab so I guess the
CIA already had that opinion that it was
probably the Wuhan lab that was a source
of leak but by not releasing it which
would be their job uh if it weren't for
Trump the truth may not have come
out all right that's interesting so we
do need to look into that
meanwhile Britain has a firefighting
robot that can spray 2,000 liters of
water in a minute according to
interesting
engineering huh a robot that can fire
spray 2,000 lers of water well luckily
there was a video so I could see that
the robot was not a humanoid robot
because if it had been a humanoid robot
that could shoot 2,000 lers of water the
question I would ask is where is the
water coming out
of because I just imagine this robot now
never mind you could do the joke in your
own head I don't have to explain
it did you know that John McAfee who
died a few years ago allegedly by his
own hand um he is back in the form of AI
so I guess his ex account which I think
is managed by his his widow uh says yeah
this is real it's really an AI of John
McAfee I guess it talks like him
you know it has it has his attitude and
everything and he's launching a crypto a
crypto coin of course he is um so that's
interesting I wonder what software
they're using for that because I kept
wanting to make an aim me but I don't
think the software is there
yet in other news perplexity the the app
it's an AI app that I keep telling you
is great and it is great you should use
it's it's one of the best things
honestly you know I tried a whole bunch
of AI apps and every time I got
disappointed it's like Oh I thought it
would do something more than that but
when I tried the perplexity app for
searching and asking questions oh my god
did they nail that they nailed that like
just about nothing I've ever seen so in
terms of execution a big shout out to
the perplexity AI team you guys are
geniuses
my God the the just the quality of the
app because I use it I use it all the
time every day I use it several times
and every time I'm impressed it just it
doesn't fail it's just so good
anyway uh their valuation went from not
much to 9 billion and I guess that gives
them the confidence to put together a
bid for Tik Tock and their bid would do
something to um keep the existing
stockholders in it somehow but would
give the United States the government of
the America it would give them
50% of the benefit if it goes public I
guess so there could be several hundred
billion dollars a stake here if it if it
goes public and if it goes public under
the new form so it's more of a merger
situation than a than a purchase I guess
they wouldn't purchase the algorithm so
they'd have to invent their own
algorithm but
again if it was anybody but perplexity
that said they were going to reinvent
the algorithm that was so good you know
you'd say h can they do that but once
I've seen what they did with
perplexity they certainly have the
skill whatever they're doing is really
really right so yeah maybe maybe they
can so I don't know if this is going to
work out but it's a complicated kind of
proposal and they may have answered all
the questions you know that it's a long
ways from it getting done you know if I
had to bet I'm not sure I'd bet for it
but that's a real interesting offer real
interesting
offer did you know how many uh children
are born to illegal immigrants in the
United States according to just the news
Nicholas bazy writes that in 2023 the
were a quarter million children born to
illegal immigrants to use their
phrase um that's a
lot now of course the birthright
citizenship thing is working through the
courts will probably end up in the
Supreme Court and here's what I have
discovered in this two movies on one
screen situation if you're a Democrat
the only thing that you've been told by
your news is that it clearly says in the
Constitution that Birthright citizenship
exists and if you're born here that's
the end of the story would you agree
that if you're a Democrat that's all
you've heard all you heard is it's in
the Constitution done what what else is
there to say but if you're a republican
you didn't hear that if you're
Republican you you heard a completely
different story in which uh the person
who
originally tweaked the language in the
the birthright citizenship part of the
Constitution he said directly and in his
own words it was not intended for uh
aliens or non non-citizens it wasn't
intended for them now here's where it
gets interesting the Supreme Court has a
lot of originalists on it conservatives
who want to interpret it interpret
things the way they were originally
meant to be
interpreted uh Lindsey Graham said that
he thinks there's a good chance the
Supreme Court will uh uphold the Banning
of illegal um of foreign people using it
for let's say gaming the system so I
don't know if lindsy Graham has a good
uh has a good handle on what the Supreme
Court will do but he's a serious guy and
and there's a serious argument for it
the argument against it well let me say
this if the only thing the court looked
at was what was the original intent it's
actually a slam dunk it's a slam dunk
that they did not intend uh foreigners n
to come in and have a baby and make it
an American that seems to be clear if
you go with the original argument um and
it all has to do with what the word
jurisdiction meant and I'm still not
clear about how that's important in the
story but apparently if we know that the
person who wrote it said I mean it to be
this and not that that's pretty clear
so we'll see but the precedent of doing
it uh to include anybody who is here for
any reason is so long that I don't know
if the Supreme Court is going to say you
know it's been too long you know it's
too much precedent
maybe maybe but what's different is the
the risk is completely different
now and I don't know to what extent the
Supreme Court takes that into
consideration so let's say they had a
situation where if they rule one way
they think they're right in terms of the
Constitution but it would clearly be
really dangerous for the country
itself would they do it or would they
say we don't want to destroy the country
so we're going to rule in a way that you
know doesn't Rock the Boat too much I
don't know you know I I don't think that
they would be oblivious to the impact on
the country and just look at the law but
they're kind of supposed to right it's
sort of their job just to look at the
