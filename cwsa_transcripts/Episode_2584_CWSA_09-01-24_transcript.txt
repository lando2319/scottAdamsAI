if you were going to watch the best show
ever for a Sunday morning where would
you go here probably here do you know
why because all the other people who do
this are
sleeping right lazy sleeping
podcasters they should be working like I
[Music]
am good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can understand with
they're tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a copper mug or glass a
tankered cheler Stein a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
of the dopamine h of the day the thing
that makes everything better is called
the simultaneous zip believe it it's
happening now
go thank you Paul good to know the sound
is working I had
to I had to make some
modifications to my system and I wasn't
quite sure I got it all together but I
did look at
that here are some news from Gilmore
Health news there's a
pillow that mimics human breathing
so if you don't have a partner you can
uh you can ug your pillow and your
pillow will give you
oxytocin how about that you can hug a
pillow and it's one more reason for not
having other people in your
life now what it doesn't say is whether
you can hump the pillow I think you can
if it's your pillow if it's somebody
else's pillow let's say you're staying
over somebody's house don't hump their
pillow
I don't know if there's a law against it
but it just seems Bad
Manners now I've got a little tip for
you you ready for
this do you remember when you were a
little kid maybe you do maybe you don't
did you have a blanket when you were
really little you know like a toddler
and it feels so good to like hug your
little fuzzy warm
blanket here's my tip for
sleeping that never
changes the feeling that you get of
hugging a soft blanket is exactly as
good at my current age than it was at
age two so I use a fuzzy blanket instead
of a pillow I have pillows of course but
I like to you know scrunch up the the
softest fuzziest uh blanket and put my
head on that on top of a
pillow oh my god it feels like a
breathing pillow it's so good I
recommend it if you don't by the way
remember when I was uh doing the live
streams during the
pandemic um I would do the uh the
simultaneous swaddle where I would
literally have a soft blanket on when I
was doing the live streams and a number
of you would put on your soft blankets
as well it really does change your
mental health it it absolutely
immediately changes how you feel there's
nothing like a soft blanket by the way
if you don't believe it try putting a
blanket over your pet like if you have a
cat or a dog for some reason they just
love it they just love being under a
blanket I don't anyway here's a big
question the Vigilant Fox is reporting
on this on
X is the sun good for
you put this in the category of every
single thing you've ever been told about
health might be
wrong maybe all of
it the only thing where sure of is
that we're not sure of anything but
here's the question is it better to stay
out of the Sun and not get sun cancer
skin cancer or is it better to get a
little sun and get the benefits of the
sun which would
include it's good for your mental health
it reduces some kinds of cancers it's
vital for your
cardiovascular it's good for your
longevity produces vitamin D it's vital
for immune functions
I have to admit this one's a little
puzzling for me because I have the kind
of skin that if I walk past a 60 watt
bulb I've got to go see a doctor it's
like ah I think you got a little bulb
cancer here from that bright bulb so I'm
not so sure that getting a lot of sun is
good for me
specifically I suspect there's a great
deal of
variability um in how you can handle the
Sun so I'm not going to make any
recommendations or even guesses about
this but it is
notable that we're not entirely sure if
Sun is good for you or bad for you now
we know it's good for you in the vitamin
D way but we don't know how much what's
the right amount of sun how much kills
you and how much is good for you do not
know but I am uh I will tell you that uh
I have added to my habit the the
huberman techniques of getting um
getting in the
sun right after the show usually it's
the first thing I do I go stand in the
sun just because it makes me feel good
and I usually take my shoes off and
stand on the ground so I get
grounded working my breathing the the
hubman breathing you know two inhales in
and one exhale and then I get some sun
and then I take my dog to the park and I
stand in the Sun a little bit more I
don't get a lot but I got to tell you
that when I miss that little that little
bit of habit I've developed in the
morning oh man can I feel it so it
either works really good or the placebo
to it is working but something's working
so let let me put this into a useful
tip if you haven't yet tried this and
I'll explain it again you really ought
to so for the for the investment of
nothing you know no effort whatsoever
there's no work that goes into it's not
like exercise where it's good for you
but it's hard just walk outoors and
stand in the sun before you know before
much of the morning goes away and stand
there stand there barefoot if you can I
mean imagine if it's cold you can do it
in your garage on the garage floor but
you want to do the breathing work on
your posture stand in the sun
barefooted no more than like 3
minutes and watch how it changes how you
feel and then use a soft blanket for a
pillow you'll you'll thank me so
much well here's the important news of
the day there's a sex robot named
Samantha I guess it's one of the famous
ones sex robots it's getting a software
update that it will uh decline to have
sex with you uh if it feels disrespected
or bored and if you get aggressive with
it it'll it'll go limp
well I'm no product expert but if I were
making a sex doll one thing I would not
build into it is the ability to say no
because I feel like that's very close to
the central the central benefit of the
product is that it's good to go and you
are so it feels like a move backwards
and I do wonder if when the real AI sex
robots come online and you know they
will
are they going to argue with you about
doing the deed are they going to have
headaches I mean if they learn
everything they know from a large
language model with patterns there's
going to be a lot of headaches but
here's what I'm worried
about I pay a bunch of money I get
myself a good sex robot it's totally
down for it all the time and then it
joins only fans and I never see it
again it could happen it could happen
people that's all I'm saying you don't
want your sex about to join o only fans
because they can get more money that
way well there's a story that Ford motor
is the latest company that's uh going to
take a fresh look at its Dei policies
got a little pressure got a fresh look
which is interesting because I was
recently at a Ford
dealership the uh there were quite a few
employees I don't know if you've going
to a car dealership lately but there are
a lot of people wandering around it's
it's whole lot of employees everywhere
it seems like and uh I was recently at
the Ford dealership locally and I saw
Zero white
men zero white men none I didn't see any
anywhere working anywhere in the
dealership they might had some in the
back but I didn't see any now you're
expecting me to say something like oh
that Dei made them all inefficient and
they were doing a bad job no actually
they did a great job I I I would say it
was one of my best car dealership
experiences uh zero white men which does
raise some questions but excellent
Service uh very
professional
um let's see uh Mark hbin did a little
poll on uh on the xplatform which as you
know those polls are not scientific but
they're kind of fun uh especially if you
get embarrassed by your own poll so Mark
Cuban asks this question whose Persona
and character would you like to see
young children grew up to have either KL
Harris or Donald Trump so what do you
think people said on X when asked which
character would you like to see your
young children
have
Well turns out that Trump got 67% of the
vote and Harris 33 so by by 2 to one
people would rather have their child
grow up to have the Donald Trump uh
personality in
Persona I completely agree with that by
the
way everything that everything you don't
like about Trump is just sort of funny
and maybe good for him you know meaning
that it's part of his talent stack in
one way or the
other so yeah no doubt about it I would
absolutely
unambiguously rather have a kid who had
Donald Trump as a role
model anyway that's pretty funny uh
there's a yet another video somebody
found of what looks to me like kle
Harris giving a speech while
inebriated now what's interesting about
the story because you're going to say
I've heard this story before you keep
saying this what interesting about it is
it's a new
video uh I don't think it's a
necessarily a recent one but how many
are
there H how many other public figures
could you find I don't know I think
there at least half a dozen videos now
where she's giving a speech in some
official capacity and is clearly
hammered can do you think that there are
other
Professionals in that category I know
some of you are going to say Nancy
Pelosi but I think that that probably is
more age
related I don't know how in the world
could she win it's a mystery okay I know
the answer all right let's uh check into
uh California see how California is
doing as you know California is one of
the most famous Democrat Le States
and Democrats are doing great aren't
they so let's see uh just checking in on
the news of San Francisco uh let's see
Colin rug is reporting that uh the San
Francisco 49ers have a first round pick
Ricky
piol excellent so the good news is the
San Francisco 49ers got a first round
draft pick so good for
him oh he got a shot yesterday in Union
Square he was
shopping and uh somebody just shot him
in the chest he is in serious but I
think uh he's going to he walked to the
I think he was walking after he got shot
so I don't know how bad it is but shot
in the chest doesn't sound
good so I remember when Union Square was
a safe place I've been there many
times and I can't say I've ever felt it
was dangerous before but I wouldn't even
think about going there now I wouldn't
go anywhere near that place but that's
just one one anecdotal little thing come
on let's not mock California because of
one little crime problem can we agree on
that it's anecdotal it's not it's not
showing you any kind of trend or
anything like that it's just a oneoff
so there's so many other good things
happening in California for
example uh Governor Nome uh is looking
to uh get rid of the price gouging in
the California gas industry
because our gas prices are high in
California because all the uh price
gouging
so the uh so there was a new some
appointe uh Vice chair c CA Gunda of the
California energy commission it's
somebody that Nome appointed and he
testified earlier that the commission
has found oh no evidence of price
gouging and says we should increase the
supply in the market and that'll reduce
the price
oh so in other words the person that
nuum appointed says that Nome is 100%
wrong on his way to fix prices so nome's
using that price gouging thing too so it
doesn't sound like bad
policy it's hard to imagine a
less moral or ethical thing to do than
to literally blame companies for price
gouging when it's your
fault this is pretty bold
blaming it's one thing to say you you
know you didn't get something done and
it's another thing to say well I did
more than you
think but to actually pick an innocent
scapegoat someone who's not even in
politics you know the corporations yeah
Kamer is picking the some of the food
companies and now new some picking the
uh gas related
Industries how how evil do you have to
be to so obviously pick an innocent
person to blame for some of the worst
behavior ever when it's your fault and
everybody knows it it's insanely
unethical
incredible do Republicans do anything
like
that I I'd love to know if Republicans
are this unethical in different ways and
I'm blind to it
am I blind to some unethical behavior
from the Republicans probably you know
I've got the same problem of
confirmation bias that everybody has but
I can't think of anything that's this
evil it is there a situation where Trump
is blaming innocent citizens not
politicians but just citizens in the
Private
Industry is Trump blaming them for
anything that he
did can can you think of any example of
that I mean what is worse than blaming
an innocent for the thing that you did
obviously and it's clearly your
fault that's that's as low as you can
get and both Nome and ARS are doing it
with this price gouging
stuff well but everything else
California does make sense and uh
there's nothing you could possibly
criticize about it oh here's a
California bill that would ban voter ID
passes the legislature awaiting some
signature oh so according to
zeroedge uh there's a bill that would
ban local governments from requiring ID
why would you do that what possible
reason would anybody give for that well
the reason has something to do with well
you don't want all of your your laws to
be different in different precincts
around the the
state really really that's the that's
the reason the reason is so you don't
have different rules in different states
that's the reason that you don't need ID
to vote in
California let me ask you this how many
people go to vote and don't bring
ID what is the total number of people
who have ever showed up to vote who
didn't have
ID it's got to be like a really small
number but I would think it would
involve you you know people who are
registered and legally could vote as
well as people who are not legally
registered so yeah that's probably
exactly what it looks like uh Elon Musk
is very clear that he thinks the migrant
situation is bringing in
voters uh I don't know if they're
bringing in voters or bringing in people
who can have a mail and ballot sent to
them that could be Harvest
harvested but uh yeah there is no
legitimate reason
none for not requiring ID to vote it's
the dumbest most transparently evil
thing except for all the other evil
things all
right um but everything else in
California is working pretty
well oh here's a story from just the
news that nearly 600 California
officials have been convicted on federal
corruption charges over the last 10
years
that feels like a
lot
600 local officials 600 of them were
Crooks running local now how many got
away if they caught
600 how many were corrupt but are get
still getting away with it well it's a
multiple of
600 it's not it's not less than 600 it's
probably something like five times this
there might be thousands of local
officials who are just on the take
here's what I think I don't think local
officials should ever have control
over
money they're all corrupt have you ever
seen a small well any kind of local uh
government that wasn't corrupt it
attracts corrupt
people it it's it's a job that's so
unpleasant unless you assume you're
going to get in the job for corruption
it's not worth
doing literally you get in it for the
corruption let let's be honest who's who
looks at the job of local government and
says you know now there is a career
local
government now some people maybe it's a
seems like a safe job or something but I
feel like the very nature of it is that
you know that if you get the job you can
take all kinds of Kickbacks for giving
giving business to preferred
vendors and I think they all do it it
it's probably close to 100% every public
every local um good-sized town is
probably corrupt probably every one of
them is my guess and the reason is you
can't really catch it you don't really
know what side deals have been made so
it's not like somebody's handing
somebody a big bag of money every
time so I think that we need some kind
of
major Readjustment in our political
system so that the question of who
spends money and how is either way more
transparent or the local governments
just can't even be
involved I I just don't think the local
government should have big money
spending privileges period there's got
to be some other process for that you
know maybe an independent you know
bidding process if you keep them honest
I know but definitely elected people
should not be handing out large amounts
of money on
contracts
um so it turns out there is an economist
a professional Economist who likes the
the Kam Harris unrealized tax gains plan
now everybody that I'd
seen um has said it's a terrible idea it
would destroy the economy it's basically
a form of theft and it could never be
implemented there there's no way you
could isolate
reasonable you know gains that won't go
away so but now there is one Jason
Ferman uh let's see who what kind of
what kind of Economist would be in favor
of something that's so obviously a bad
idea well let's look at his profile he's
a professor of practice at Harvard and
he teaches econ
10 oh oh he's from
Harvard I'm sorry I apologize I wasted
your time
for a minute there I thought it was a a
credible Economist but he's just a
Harvard Economist I thought it was
something
real do you remember when Harvard was
taken
seriously do you know what I think when
I see that somebody's a Harvard
Professor this is not a joke my first
thought oh a
idiot a clown that's literally what I
thought and so you know I don't know any
anything about the one individual so I'm
just saying listen to the reason I think
he gave his reasons he says I like the
Biden here's proposal to tax unrealized
capital gains he said this on X for any
given level of capital taxation it's
more efficient and fair to tax uh
unrealized gains reduce lock in and tax
planning and the proposal does a
thoughtful job of addressing tricky
implementation
issues what's that called
that's called a half
pinion I don't believe there's anybody
who said There Are No positive elements
to it it's just that the negative ones
are
bigger if you leave out the negative
part you know the effect it would have
on everything you haven't really given
us an opinion and if you just say you
like the tax proposal is that really
saying that it will work for the country
or is it just something you like because
you like
Democrats I'll tell you
you can't trust economists that went to
Harvard
apparently um but who can you trust well
here's another Economist I guess or or
business person I'm not sure if you call
him an economist or a business Expert
Robert
Reich you know him
Democrat uh he wrote an article in the
guardian that says the title is Elon
Musk is an of control here's how to
Reign him
in really
how to Reign him in you're write you're
writing an article in a major
publication about a reign in an American
citizen who is breaking no
laws maybe maybe don't reain him in
maybe you don't Reign me in maybe don't
re the anybody in if they're
breaking the law let's get the law
involved you know unless it's fake
lawfare stuff but no how about how about
if you're writing an article to say
you're reigning anybody in who's not
breaking any laws and is trying to give
free speech to the country you
are not helping let's just put it that
way how did Elon must
respond um he referred to Robert R as
Robert
rard uh uh rber rubber
rart yeah the funny part about it is
that musk knows that having any kind of
a reasonable conversation on the merits
of the argument it would completely
waste the time because the argument has
no merits the argument is based on this
is from R quote if he doesn't stop
disseminating lies and hate on
X what are you talking about
this is literally Robert R disseminating
lies and hate on in the guardian
article how many how many of the uh
political hoaxes do you think Robert
Reich believes are
true the only place you could find out
the hoaxes from the Democrats are not
true is on X it's the only place well
there are you know Fox and Breitbart I
guess so and yeah I guess there's some
you know the smaller entities just the
news and Gateway pundit for example but
uh you know the mainstream news is all
about the Oaks is being real so it is
amazing to me that the biggest Liars in
the country the the biggest hoax makers
are trying to stop that disseminating
lies and
hate well there's a New York Times
Colonist who's sort of Leaning the other
direction Nicholas
Kristoff uh wrote for the New York Times
opinion piece
that uh people should be nicer to Trump
supporters now he's not saying you
necessarily need to be kinder to Trump
himself if he don't like his policies
but they usually be
more generous with the Trump uh
followers do you know why Nicholas
Kristoff argues that you should be nicer
to the Trump
followers it turns out part of his his
reasoning is that he lives in a rural
place
and he has lots of accidental contact
with Trump supporters do you know what
he learned about Trump supporters which
every single person who has accidental
contact of a meaningful Way Comes to
realize as well they're really nice
people and why does that keep surprising
Democrats how many times have you seen a
story about a Democrat who was surprised
that if they went to a trump rally
everybody was nice even if they knew
they were on the other team everybody
was nice glad to talk do you need a
favor what can I do for you it it it's
amazing to me that we've become so
divided that people don't even know what
a trump supporter looks like or talks
like you know I've said this a number of
times I'm I'm registered as a Democrat
and you know most of my past I've been
more pro
Democrat but I enjoy the company
and interacting with Republicans and
conservatives way more because they're
just genuinely nice people and when they
disagree with you they do it with
reasons they tell you why and they'll
listen to your side they're just nice
people now of course any any
generalization doesn't apply to all
people you know there's bad people in
every group but it is interesting how
consistent it is that the I'll call them
the brain
left that that their opinions of the
world dissolve on contact with human
beings in that reality their their
opinions dissolve on
contact now that doesn't happen the
other way does it I don't really ever
hear those stories it just feels like
that's a one-way
effect ever having been a Democrat makes
me question your intellect Scott well I
would argue that being a Democrat when
Bill Clinton was in office wasn't such a
bad deal I thought he was a pretty solid
president still
do um I think the current incarnation of
the Democrats is just badshit crazy so I
if I had more recently supported
Democrat
views that would be something to
question all
right uh there's a story that the FCC is
refusing funds for starlink I guess
SpaceX which owns
starlink they want a bid for 885 million
to deploy their uh satellite internet
stuff to uh gazillion
places but here's why it's been the FCC
refused to fund them even though it had
been all approved um it says they denied
starl the funds claiming the starl can't
prove they have the ability to provide
the service
can't prove the starlink can't prove has
the ability to provide starlink
service now is that because they can't
prove they have satellites in those
areas or that they would be
overloaded I feel like none of this
looks like it's anything but
political so without knowing the details
of this maybe they have an argument
maybe they do but it's not whatever
their argument is it's was not detailed
it's just that they haven't proven they
have the
ability correct me if I'm wrong I I
thought the satellites were now reaching
basically everything in the United
States is there part of the United
States that can't get
starlink I don't know I've got questions
to me that sounds political like a
political um blow against Elon
Musk all right so as you know there's
this just stupid political news about
which who is more disrespectful to the
military this is so
dumb so dumb so you know Trump's getting
pressure because he went to
the uh Cemetery Arlington Cemetery you
which is not normally done but it was
the the gold star families of the people
who died in Afghanistan in the closing
days you know they had invited him to be
there so the gold star families were
delighted with his contact but the
Democrats are using it as you uh
disgraced that that precious place to
which I
say
boring and then there is the the Trump
The hoax that Trump called the soldiers
ever uh suckers and losers that
obviously didn't happen boring boring
hoax
um and then uh and then there's the
stuff about
walls you know walls not doing and you
let's say not being completely honest
about the nature of his service you know
suggesting he was in a war zone when he
wasn't and Etc suggesting had a higher
rank than technically he did and stuff
like that and I'm I'm going to Triple
down on my opinion about all
this I think this is up to the gold star
families and and Serv as people so I
feel like you know if one of these two
characters is offending them more than
the other then certainly they have every
every right to uh vote against them Etc
but the rest of us those who had not
been in the military I feel like we
should take a pass on this
one and just sort of Take the Lead You
know just just watch what the people
with more direct military family or
otherwise connection have you know my my
personal opinion of who went too far
who's disrespecting who I don't think
that adds
anything I I think I would rather take a
backseat and say all right if you were
in the military how do you feel will it
change your vote be interesting to know
but um here here's my problem I figure
everybody who was in the military is at
a higher level of credibility and
patriotic Behavior than I am so what the
hell am I doing judging any of
them I'm not the judge I shouldn't be
the judge I have not earned any of that
credibility or right or honor so the
people who have you tell me how you feel
about it and uh if that if how you feel
about it changes the vote
that could be important my my feeling is
it's not going to change many votes but
I agree with uh the Mike cernovich take
that this is one of the few places you
might have actually had a a genuine
chance to change a vote very rare at
this stage of the election for anybody
to change their mind but this might be
the one but not 10% of the people maybe
1% which is still a
lot all right apparently a
uh Matt schlap uh is CPAC people are
going to be monitoring dropboxes in
Arizona so they've got a very well
organized uh situation in which they're
going to train people to be uh um let's
say have good manners and be good
citizens and not bother the people are
using the Dropbox which would be
terrible don't do that don't bother any
people who are using the Dropbox don't
threaten them don't but if they if they
simply just are good citizens and they
simply are
observing very good so
Matt if you can pull this off with
whoever else you're working with
excellent job I'll feel a lot better if
the boxes are being watched wouldn't you
I'll feel a lot
better now do you think they'll notice
anything or find anything I don't know
they'll certainly be able to find people
who show up multiple
times but uh yeah I think I think they
have to be a certain distance away from
it and there are some other rules it's
going to be hard for them to satisfy all
those rules because it's hard to get
everybody to you know dance the same way
but I love this so now we got
whistleblowers we've got far more
observers we've got some Dropbox
observers so I remind you that my
prediction for the election is as
follows with all of these
observers you can guarantee guarantee I
mean I think you would agree with me
that this is guaranteed to happen that
whether or not there's any real cheating
in the election and this is important
whether or not there's any there will be
massive reports of them because people
are going to imagine they saw
something that might be important and
then maybe if if you looked into it
you'd find out okay that wasn't what you
thought it was
so I don't have a prediction that any
real cheating of scale will be
found I think the the Trump movie
requires it so it does look like the
simulation is lining up to deliver it so
if if you take the point of view that we
are going to look like a movie for
reasons that are mysterious we just
always end up looking like a movie in
terms of the way things unfold
that suggests that there would be
something that got
found
but with or without any real findings of
any real rigging there are going to be
massive reports of rigging that don't
pan out how in the world are you going
to have an election that everybody feels
good about when there couldn't possibly
be enough time to look into all of them
and they're just going to be out there
and and you'll be certifying ction with
what you know hundreds of thousands of
people who think they saw something
maybe tens of thousands could be a lot I
don't see how we have an
election that people trust when we're
done
um so Harris is again demanding that the
microphones be unmuted because she
thinks that will give people a a more
accurate view of how bad that Trump is
all interrupt and mansplaining and stuff
that men do um some are
suggesting that what she's really trying
to angle for is cancelling the
only the only
debate do you think that she's clever
enough or weasly enough that she'll
she'll go right up to you know get close
to the debate well we're already close
and then say well I really had planned
to but we could not agree on the the
details she might I would not rule out
that she has no
debates here's why debating would be
worse if she has a
debate I think it's two to one she gets
annihilated would you agree it's about
two to one I think the odds say she got
annihilated because she's bad at it and
everybody would agree with that well
she's bad at the whole public speaking
thing and she's
and Trump is good at it so those are two
things we know for sure somebody who is
unnaturally bad at it with somebody
who's unnaturally good at it it should
be a it should be a blowout unless all
she did is just read her little talking
points so I could see the possibility
that she would look to weasy canel it
but I'll bet against it I think she
would consider it too much of a too much
of a Target on her back if she did
that anyway um so Gateway pundits
reporting their new complaint against
the US Postal Service for something
involved allegedly shipping of at least
a million mail-in ballots from a
facility in uh Beth Page New York to
Pennsylvania now I think this is a story
we've all heard a bunch of times and
I've heard the
debunks in other words there's there's a
counter story that says oh there's
nothing to this story it's all been
explained a million times and the debunk
sound if it's the same thing I think it
is the debunk sounded pretty convincing
to
me but so does the
claim so how do you know what's right if
both the claim and the debunk sound
reasonably real but here was a factoid I
had not seen
so I'd love to know if this is in
dispute or if both sides agree to the
following
statement uh that the every every piece
of first class mail is supposed to be
imaged by the post office so regulations
require that they image them before
they're
delivered um it doesn't say if that
means they weren't imaged but I think
that's the implication so that would be
question number one
is it possible that a million things
didn't get
imaged and maybe they have a good reason
for that I don't know but here's the
part that really caught my mind or
caught my attention uh the facility
where the driver allegedly picked up
these million ballots that were
allegedly already filled
out um is not a place where you pick up
mail it's only certified for handling
packages and express mail so in other
words there was no legal
justification to account for the ballots
going through that warehouse at all to
which I said
ping if you can prove that's
true then you you're very close to
having a kraken here because if it's
true that a million ballots went through
a US Postal Service facility for which
no ballot should have ever gone through
then the the argument that something
terribly wrong happened there is much
stronger but remember all of these
voting claim stories have either turned
to dust or they didn't have standing or
they didn't matter or there was some
debunk you didn't know about so don't
assume that any of the stories are
true I'm just reporting them because
they're in the news could it be true
maybe I don't
know um
the uh the publication PM I think
they're calling themselves PM they used
to
be uh something
Millennial
um say that Harris is in a worse
position in terms of her
polling than
uh than either Biden or Hillary were
when they ran against Trump so Biden won
but Hillary did not even though Hillary
was doing better in the polls than KL
Harris is
now
um and the reason
given for why it looks like K is ahead
but when it comes to the you know the
actual election that she might lose now
some of that is the Electoral College
situation so the the popular vote of the
whole country isn't determining who wins
it's the individual places so that's
part of it but it turns out that um the
polling for AA according to Newsweek
might
be somewhat
fake because Trump supporters lie to
pollsters how many of you remember in
2016 when I was one of the loudest and
first people I don't know who else was
saying it but I was certainly if not the
loudest and earliest one of
them um to say that Trump supporters
were so demonized that they don't answer
polls because they wouldn't trust that
they weren't just being you know
identified for later
destruction and then the election
happened and I said well there it is
more people voted for Trump than the
polls suggested there's your shy your
shy Trump voters and then the news
mocked me
again saying oh there's no evidence of
that it was some kind of shy Trump
supporters who don't answer polls but as
of
today it's reported as a a simple fact
that Trump trump supporters don't answer
polls the same way and it's because they
don't trust the
pollsters so I'm going to take that as a
win for predicting it completely
accurately being mocked about it for a
long time and then winning in the end
that's the way I like to do it
remember I told you that if you know
what happens in the news you don't know
anything what you need to know is who
and also why but the who will get you
pretty close to why here's a little
factoid that you can you can store away
in your brain and you could put whatever
interpretation on it you like so I'll
give you the fact and then you interpret
it any way you
like Dana Bash who is the only
journalist who got the
um got the job to talk to kamla Harris
first you know after she was uh selected
as their uh standard Bearer for the
Democrats and did you know that danab
bash's ex-husband is Jeremy bash who is
one of the 51 Intel
officials um who signed that Hunter
Biden laptop fake
letter so Dana Bash it's her not her
current husband her ex-husband is one of
the one of the people on the
51 letters does that tell you
that you have a good feeling about danab
bash being a totally objective
Observer now it's an ex-husband so
that's processed different than a
husband but certainly suggests that uh
she might not be
100% independent
did you know according to bejor lomborg
that even though we're concerned about
Rising temperatures with climate that
cold kills nearly 30 times more people
than
heat and uh you know the food grows
better Etc now here's my problem with
that
argument and V uses the argument too
it's
true so I mean I'm sure it's true that
cold kills way more people than than
Heat but the trouble is I don't like
looking at any of these topics as if
there's some kind of gradual
slope because the the heat argument is
that you reach a drop off point where
everything falls
apart now I'm not saying we will so I I
predict that's not true but the
argument is that things will be all
right until everything until the wheels
come
off so I don't think you can look at a
Wheels come off scenario
uh based on a historical comparison so
historically cold killed more than
warmth but what if the warmth went to
1,000
de I'm almost positive that the heat
would kill more people at a thousand
degrees so everything has some kind of
you know there's a limit and there's a a
cliff problem that doesn't get picked up
in these kinds of comparisons I think
the general point stands very well the
general point is that it's not a
panic so so that stands up perfectly but
just just beware that the argument isn't
that things just get a little warmer the
argument which I don't buy but this is
the argument is that we're getting close
to some kind of cliff and it reaches
some point and the the oceans boil and
the ice caps melt and we're all dead I
don't think any of that sounds even a
little bit reasonable
but just know the
argument well Mike Ben's still doing his
best to help us understand the Brazil
censoring the xplatform situation as
best I can understand it our state
department funds lots of entities around
the globe for reasons that should
benefit the United States so in other
countries there would be these
non-government organizations that are
you know in influencing various
countries in various ways but one of
them or multile of them I'm not sure how
many uh is receiving massive money from
the US state department and some amount
of that money is going to support
censorship in Brazil and probably other
places so we're paying to promote
censorship which of course is described
as stopping misinformation and hate but
it's censorship because nobody needs to
censor things that everybody agrees
with so it's not free speech unless you
can do the things that are dangerous and
insulting and sometimes wrong otherwise
it's not free speech at all
so why is it the US government is
funding the destruction of the United
States Free
Speech well you might be tempted to
think it's some big bureaucracy and
therefore because it's a big bureaucracy
we're not even aware that we're
accidentally funding some people who
were ruining free speech in the United
States but I don't think that's what's
happening I think the state department
is actively destroying Free
Speech because they think it's bad for
America or themselves so it looks like
the reason that the United States is not
intervening in the Brazilian bad
behavior to an American company X trying
to you know ban well they have banned
them um the reason America is not
fighting on behalf of that American
corporation is probably
politics probably they're using Brazil
to kill X and the same way they'll
probably use Europe to try to kill it
because if they could take out
X they win it all X is the only thing
left uh of scale you know there there
there are other smaller entities but you
know just just think about what would be
the reach of let's say just the
news if there were no
x no reach at all what would my reach be
if there were no X I've got 1.1 million
followers on X do you know what my total
number of followers everywhere else is
rounds to zero almost nothing I don't
have a Facebook following I don't use
Instagram for anything but
fun
so um but I wanted to say this here's
here's a I don't know maybe you all know
this already but after I got
cancelled if the xplatform had not you
know lifted me back into some kind of
you know minor relevance by just
massively people signed up to follow me
because they thought there was some
injustice going on and that allowed me
to rebuild my operation but only because
X if Elon Musk had not purchased x uh I
my user count never would have gone up
because it was clearly
suppressed um and I could not have
rebuilt I would have
retired just think about that no
exaggeration whatsoever if I did not
have the xplatform as my main starting
point for rebuilding something I would
have just retired I didn't need to work
I prefer
it so you know if you ever have these
moments where you're wondering what is
the contribution and the value of the
xplatform it's incalculable already it
is the only thing that's keeping us from
Full dictatorship that will you know
look like a fake election sort of thing
like Putin but it would be a
dictatorship essentially it might change
out the people
but the but whoever is in charge behind
the curtain would still be in
charge
so uh so Mike Ben has offered to you
know testify or explain to anybody who
needs to explain that the United States
is behind the attack on X indirectly
through its through its financing of Nos
and their effect on Brazil well Trump
weighed in on the question of weed
legalization in Florida is state where
he resides and he he said we should not
be criminal in Florida when it is legal
in so many other states now that's not a
reason but it sounds like one so I'm in
favor of
it is this a reason it should not be
illegal in one state because it's legal
in others that's not a
reason it's the same thing he's in favor
of of uh with uh
abortion Trump is completely okay with
the states deciding sometimes it's legal
sometimes it's not it's the same with
weed if the state decides it's legal and
one decides it's not that's our
system so that's not really a
reason but does he need one does he need
a reason no not really because the
public the public agrees with him at a
very large percentage now I know Mike
cernovich has been
uh saying quite a bit
anti-weed and I think that's completely
appropriate for anyone who is a parent
of young kids if you're a parent of
young kids you should be
anti-weed
100% because that's the model you're
setting for your kids so if you're in
the job of being a parent yeah be
anti-weed and be strongly anti-weed it's
going to help a
lot um but if you're not in that
situation you might think
differently and uh but Trump is
concerned about people doing it in
public so he want some carouns that say
you can't you can't do weed in public I
don't mind that I don't mind that at all
um yeah because that's not really about
weed that's simply manners so I'm in
favor of
manners so let's let's do better on that
but uh this this is again Trump being
friendly or on the weed question really
gets to the bodily autonomy
argument I think that Trump wins
completely on bodily autonomy it just
seems the opposite so for example moving
abortion to the states means that Trump
doesn't want to be involved in your
bodily autonomy wants it closer to you
and your doctor he his opinion on weed
is that he doesn't want to be putting
your body in jail for weed that's less
control of your body than we have right
now uh he wants fewer migrants to come
in the country and take your job and
kill you which would be less imposition
on your body he wants more police same
thing so that the crime doesn't have so
much you know imposition on your
body um I told earlier in the show I
told you that uh a first round draft
pick for the 49ers got
shot uh in Union uh Union Place Union
Square in San
Francisco now does he have bodily
autonomy well he thought he had bodily
autonomy but now he's got a bullet in
his body so now his body is going to go
a direction that he was not in charge of
so if Trump could get you know get rid
of
crime a lot more people are going to
have bodily autonomy because they won't
have a bullet in their body and they
won't be getting raped so that's some
bodily autonomy right there and of
course keeping guns for your own
protection I would say is bodily
autonomy you know written large WR
large all right in overseas uh stories
um apparently uh Israel has discovered
that Hamas murdered six hostages just
recently one of them was a dual citizen
American Israeli C
and
uh apparently there were over a hundred
left
101 still
held now do you think it's anybody's
fault that these six were killed because
some are saying it's netanyahu's fault
it's somebody's fault for not for not
doing peace here's the
problem this is another one of those
half opinion things if your half opinion
is we should stop fighting and get get
those uh hostages
back you're not really done with the
analysis if you reward people for taking
hostages how's that going to work out
they're going to take so many more
hostages if it
works um should you negotiate with
terrorists who have
hostages well maybe a little bit to see
if you can get them back for free but if
you're going to you know end up paying a
lot for hostages it's not really a
pattern that you can allow to be
set so I would say that uh I blame
nobody for this except
Hamas I think it would be simplistic to
imagine that if some Israeli or American
politician or somebody else did
something differently that this would
have worked out
differently now if all hundred of them
had been killed I would say
H maybe you could have done something
differently there but if six out of 100
are killed all in the same place that's
probably more to do with what their
local situation was you know I I doubt
that was even a an order from the top or
anything like that so I'm not going to
blame anybody in Israel or America for
that I think it's just a tragedy and if
Israel treats the situation like the
hostages are already dead even knowing
that many of them would not
be militarily and strategically that
might be the best play it's as sad as
that is well Russia says it downed over
150
drones uh in uh one of the biggest
Ukrainian drone attacks so the drones
were in various places but
150 they must have been small ones that
they jammed I would
guess so drone War is coming it's going
to be all drones I think we're maybe one
year away from the border of Ukraine and
Russia being just drones because the
soldiers don't have a chance against the
drones so you might as well just have a
drone
War all right ladies and
gentlemen that's all I had
today um I think there's some big news
coming this coming week because things
got a little too quiet it's a little
little too
quiet you missed all the Russian Mass
drone
attacks what do you mean I miss
them it's been nothing but drone attacks
all the time
there
um all
right uh I forget if there's positive
feedback or negative
feedback uh the CO2 thing is being yeah
yeah there's there's yet another study
showing that climate change is not CO2
caused but um you've heard enough of
those all
right there are no hostages some might
be
[Music]
prisoners drones will take out aircraft
carriers Maybe
all right
everybody uh I'm G to talk to the uh
subscribers on locals

people on here today all right I'm going
