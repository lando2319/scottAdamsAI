Bubba
good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
there's never been a better time and the
news is just full of Wonders and
outrages and provocations Ah that's good
stuff and that's why you come here if
you'd like to enjoy this
more than let's say
what would be like really valuable
if you'd like to enjoy this more than an
egg more than an egg all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker chalice
or Stein a canteen yoga flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called this
simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
well the locals people are reminding me
to go private on the locals platform
because afterwards I'll be telling them
all the good stuff that I couldn't tell
you
well um you might be aware that I have
split into four separate movies
I'm now four different people according
to the internet and I embrace I embrace
all of those movies and one
uh I'm a far-right uh conservative
in another
I am left of Bernie Sanders
both of those running at the same time
but more recently I have also become two
people about the pandemic
I'm a person who uh in one movie I was
promoting the vaccinations and I loved
masks and boy did I love the the
lockdowns
good at the same time
I'm the opposite of that person
the person who didn't do any of that
stuff
so now wait is there four of me
no way
it's actually four squared right 16 of
me can you help me with the math because
there's a now a far-right conservative
who didn't like vaccinations one who did
there's a left a Bernie person who liked
vaccination how many is that
I've moved into lots of people
all right uh by the way I uh I block
everybody who tells me that they don't
want to hear about AI or or any of the
logic of the pandemic anymore because
I'm going to talk about those more
so a lot of people get blocked for that
so on four people and uh somebody asked
me on Twitter if I were if I'm just
being sarcastic
because viewed from one movie
I look like I'm just joking
but from viewed from another movie
I'm not
so which one is true
which one is true I used to believe that
I had to convince everybody that one of
them was true and all the other versions
of me were false
I have since embraced that they just all
exist
so I've surrendered to reality which is
a weirdly
satisfying feeling
like it used to be all fighty
you know like even when I was relaxing
I'd be like oh I have to go clear up
that misconception
you know because it's about me and you
always feel like well I have to clear up
a misconception about me
but now I've embraced that they just
live as separate realities and I can
actually travel between them I believe
I'm the first
correct me if I'm wrong
but I believe I'm the first
uh bubble tourist
where I can actually leave my bubble of
reality
completely enter another bubble and
actually stay there for a while I can't
live there
but then I can come back anytime I want
has anybody ever done that before
I mean actually
because you're watching me do it I'm
actually walking between the bubbles and
I'm living in all of them and completely
inhabiting them and then I just leave to
go to the other bubble
it seems to be working
I learned that from
uh well I will tell you where I learned
that from so here's my Dilbert comic
today I'll I'll read this to you in case
you missed it what there's some of you
who don't read it every day as soon as
it comes out what all right well I'll
fix that for him here's a dogberry he's
got his own podcast of course
if if anybody were going to have a
podcast it would be dog burp and he's
talking to Tina the tech writer and uh
Dogma says
relationships work when men give women
What Women Want
and women give men nothing in return
and Tina says why do men accept that
Dogwood says the trick is to make them
think it's temporary
that is all
uh well I have 850 000 followers uh
thanks to
a number of retweets by comments by Elon
Musk
and I believe I told you that when I
reached a million
I would effectively be running the
country
so I'm only 150 000 away should be
hitting that by around July at the
current run rate
which might change so in July I'll be
running the world
um unless AI is
so it's sort of between me and AI
it's going to be gonna be a Pitch battle
we'll get there more about that
so the AP Associated Press you might
know this not know this but they issue
style guides for journalists
so as the language evolves
the style guide will be updated to say
you know it'd be better if you refer to
these people this way or you capitalize
this or don't capitalize that and
they've got a new guide and they they
suggest
that people avoid using the word the
before groups of people so if because
it's dehumanizing so they say don't say
the poor
the poor because it's like sort of
dehumanizing so you don't say the
disabled or even the French
uh Elon Musk saw this guidance
from the AP about not using the before
the names of things
and he tweeted so then why do you call
yourself the Associated Press
now that's why we have Twitter
um
but I wanted to add my own style guide
update
because it's not only the AP who can do
that I don't know if you know this but
professional writers such as myself
we're actually the ones who create
common usage and we're the well we don't
create it but we endorse it
so when the public starts using a word a
certain way that hasn't been used before
for a while the style guide would say no
that is incorrect don't use that word
that
don't use that word the common people
are using but when professional writers
and journalists start using the word
that's when it enters common usage and
then everybody says okay it's okay now
so I'd like to do that with a word as in
my role as a professional writer
um
did you know that Adam Schiff
uh there's a past tense for Jeff
so Schiff is what you would call them in
the present like if you walk by you
right now you'd say there is Adam Schiff
and that would be correct usage
but if you're talking about something he
did in the past
the correct tense is shat
so the usage for that would be
Schiff was once on the Intel committee
but they shout him out they shout him
out
so that's correct usage get the tenses
right
uh
project Veritas their video
uh got removed
their video about the directed Evolution
the Pfizer employee who said well we you
know somebody had a meeting just
somebody in a meeting it wasn't got
wasn't company policy but somebody a
meeting brought up maybe evolving the
uh the coronavirus so that they can
better
prepare vaccinations now of course the
thought of that is alarming but it might
have been just something somebody said
because he was on a date trying to
impress his date that's what it looked
like but imagine the fact that YouTube
removed that
just think about it YouTube removed that
it was a real thing that happened
and I think they removed it because it
was medical misinformation
it was medical misinformation
it was a important you know a key
employee at Pfizer who was talking in
his own voice
with no editing well there could have
been some editing you could you always
have to be careful about that there
could have been anything
uh yeah we'll talk about the dashboard
but just think about that just think
about the fact that it was a real thing
that really happened it's on video
there's no question about whether it
happened and there's no real question
about what he said
and that YouTube decided that you can't
see that on YouTube
I mean there's there's no commentary I
could even add to that is there there's
nothing to say about it it's just the
worst thing ever
it's like just the worst thing ever
and we're gonna let it happen because we
always do
all right here was a funny tweet
by the way here is the macro
theme of today's live stream
here's the the macro theme
uh you know all the news we're having
the video of Paul Pelosi there's a video
of the Memphis thing
it looks like it's all a diversion
doesn't it
correct me if I'm wrong but you seem to
be two important stories going on one is
what's up with the vaccination shots and
the other is what's up in Ukraine
Ukraine is really really important
right
the vaccination situation
is very very important and suddenly
there's all kinds of news that isn't
very much isn't important but it's super
interesting so we'll talk about them
because they're super interesting so I'm
actually going to fall for the Trap
I'm literally going to fall for the Trap
even as I see it I see it's a trap is
obviously a diversion but I'm going to
be diverted anyway because it's so darn
interesting
well I saw a tweet by MSNBC host Mary
Hassan
now I'm just going to read this
and my only commentary on this is this
is something a real person said
because you know somebody from a
different movie
if you were in this person's movie it
would just look ordinary but if you're
not in this person's movie you'll just
go
what
here's what he tweeted Donald Trump has
been indicted for no crimes
Donald Trump has been reinstated to
Twitter and Facebook
Donald Trump is running for president
again
it's almost as if a violent Trump
incited Insurrection never happened
or happened and was then forgotten
I just let that sit there for a moment
yeah
it is as if
it is as if a violent Trump incited
Insurrection never happened
it's exactly like that
is precisely like that it's not even a
little bit not like that
it's actually exactly like that but but
watching watching the growing
realization
that reality and his understanding of
reality are not quite lining up
he's so close
but he doesn't have it yet
is that funny like he he can see the
problem but he can't he can't quite
quite connect the dots so close so close
this doesn't make sense all of these
facts which we know are true
don't seem to line up with the narrative
that has been on TV for a year what's
going on
so I tweeted back to Adam and I said
wait until you find out about the fine
people hoax the injecting disinfectant
hoax and the Russian collusion hoax and
here's the best part
while I was tweeting that
as I was tweeting whether you find out
about all these other hoaxes another
hoax was being unraveled uh with the
Twitter files Matt taibi at the same
time I was calling out waiting to find
out about all these hoaxes another
gigantic one was being unraveled by Matt
tyvee who's doing God's work right yeah
how many of you have never heard before
this week of something called Hamilton
68.
I'd never heard of it
some of you had
interesting as really as much as I
follow the news I had never even heard
the term
uh Hamilton 68. well let me tell you
what that is we know this from the
Twitter files and from Matt taibi's
excellent reporting
you're not even going to believe this if
you haven't heard of it yet
who hasn't heard of this story yet is
there anybody who hasn't heard of the
story yet
is actually unbelievable
but it's true
all right
here's the story
sometimes several years ago
a Democrat organization that had let's
say all The Usual Suspects like podesta
associated with it John podesta do you
need to know any other the the names no
you don't you just need to know that
podesta was part of this okay
and I'll give you the end of the dance
in a minute but that's all you needed to
do and they built a an application
so they built an application and a
little uh dashboard
and it was for a built Crystal right and
uh it was the dashboard was for
journalists
who could go and check to see if any
stories on social media were really
being driven by Russian Bots
now how did this app know if something
was driven by Russian Bots
well
what they claimed was they had a secret
list of accounts on Twitter that they
knew were Russian related
and if those 600 got active on the story
let's say driving a hashtag
then they could conclude that Russia's
Russia is behind it the Bots are driving
the traffic now that would be really bad
right
because
you wouldn't want to find out that
Russia was you know moving the the Press
around or moving our understanding of
reality around
yeah so when
when Twitter found out that this thing
existed
now this is a great part of the story
uh that apparently they were asked a
number of times by different people
can you tell us which accounts you're
following or a little over 600 accounts
can you tell us which 600 accounts
you're following just so we could have
some comfort
that those are Russian related accounts
but that was Secret
that was secret because if they told you
which accounts they were following then
Russia could see it too and then Russia
would you know change out those accounts
and then the whole thing would be hidden
again so they better keep it secret
so as Matt tavey correctly points out
if you're a legitimate journalist and
somebody says we have a secret app with
a secret mechanism for telling you who
the Russian Bots are and you ask them to
tell you how they figured it out with
some transparency and they say
if they say oh you can't see our secret
mechanism
for determining what's happening
if you're a legitimate journalistic
journalist what do you do
we are private
didn't I go private
well now we're private
um so what would a legitimate journalist
do
if told that there's a secret app and we
can't tell you how it works
you would walk away you would laugh and
you would walk away it's like well
that's not real
right or if it is real we can't
determine if it's real so it's not a
story for us
but apparently the entire oh let's say
democrat-led media
uh wrote hundreds of stories in which
they did their own work on the app and
found out that things which
conservatives like were really not being
driven by conservatives or Republicans
but really they were all being duped by
Putin
now apparently this thing ran for years
and it was Twitter itself who busted him
and here's how they did it which is
clever so I guess this um
this entity was using Twitter's API now
the API is what a company publishes to
tell the third party people that they
allow to use their service you know to
query it and get data on stuff so it's
basically a back door that the company
makes available to third parties
and that's what the the app was using so
somebody at Twitter was smart enough to
look at the traffic coming in to the API
and then they could reverse engineer it
to figure out who the accounts were that
this app was targeting as the Russian
accountants and then they looked at
those accounts
and they were very much not Russian
accounts there was just ordinary
Republicans
in fact they were sort of like some of
the most objectively obviously patriotic
Americans who were just nothing but
American just nothing but American like
they're the most American account you
could ever see with no not even the
trace of a Russian tinge just nothing
absolutely just made up and they just
put a bunch of ordinary Americans into
the Russian list and they sold that for
years
now the head of this was an ex-fbi
counterintelligence guy
is there anything else you need to hear
podesta
right Bill Crystal
and an ex-fbi counterintelligence guy
obviously this was just a big Democrat
up
now
wouldn't you think this would be one of
the biggest stories of the year
what do you
it's too bad they can't get any
attention today because of those other
big stories that are coincidentally in
the news
just think about it if this were a slow
news day
how big a deal would it be that that the
Democrats were running a fake a fake
black box of Russian bot stuff
now
let me ask you this
who was the first person you heard in
public
telling you that stories of Russian Bots
were affecting the election
saying at least affecting the elections
who's the first one
I did
probably me I mean I don't know if
there's no I was way before Trump
yeah no I beat I beat everybody
yeah and I said it as soon as I saw the
memes
because as soon as I saw the beams that
they spent all of a hundred thousand
dollars on as soon as you saw him you
knew the whole the whole story was fake
because the memes were looked like High
School memes and nobody really saw them
anyway so as soon as I knew that the the
meme part of the troll story was fake
I extended that to the rest of the
Russian troll story that everything
about Russian trolls stories would be
fake including and by the way this is
not confirmed
I don't believe that the Russia hack
Russia hacked anybody's email
Maybe
but if you look at the pattern
everything blamed on Russia was fake
right yeah I'm seeing confirmations so I
think almost everything that we learned
about Russia was fake probably
everything about the Ukraine Wars
massaged and fake as well
right
so
here was a question I asked uh on
Twitter
which profession somebody trained in
these professions which one would be the
best at spotting the hoaxes
who who would be trained to spot a hoax
and I asked people who they thought
and the choices were scientists
um
engineer journalist or cartoonist I'm
sorry no hypnotist
so who could identify a mass hysteria so
actually the question was the mass
Hysteria so if you were in the mass
Hysteria
who could identify from within now
here's the problem if you're in the mass
Hysteria
you're in the mass Hysteria so you
usually can't see it if you're on the
inside
so here are the answers scientists only
12 percent
really
you think that the the profession whose
entire purpose is to figure out what's
true and what's not
would only 12 percent of them
only 12 percent of you voted that that's
the people who would know they were in a
mass list area
they should be the best
but you've rated them the worst
uh journalists seven percent so they're
the lowest on the list that's no
surprise but Engineers got 41 percent
roughly tied with hypnotists at 41
percent
now let's see your vote I'll just take
it down to the two who would be better
at identifying a mass hysteria when
they're part of it right the when
they're part of it is the important part
they have to be inside the mass hysteria
and then suddenly wake up
engineer or or hypnotist
engineer or hypnotist now those of you
saying engineer what would be the
argument that they're the least the
engineers would be the least influenced
by
um I don't know something that's not
factual right the reason you're saying
Engineers is because they would not be
affected by emotional stuff right no
totally wrong totally wrong the
engineers would be as easily fooled as
the scientists and the journalists there
wouldn't be much difference
and the reason is that none of them are
trained to spot a mass Hysteria it's a
different job being logical won't help
you at all
not even a little bit
being hyper logical won't help you at
all
being completely unemotional won't help
you at all
going to higher education wouldn't help
you at all
having smart friends won't help you at
all none of those have any effect on the
mass Hysteria
I believe there's only one profession
that could identify it which doesn't
happen to test
because amnest are looking for triggers
and tells
if you know the triggers and you know
the tell you know the word salads and
stuff like that if you if you know what
they are then you could potentially see
them and go oh shoot
I have this belief but while I hold this
belief at the same time I can see what
was the trigger for it
and I can see my own tell oh shoot I
just exhibited a tell
so a and you can see it in others more
easily so a hypnotist could call out a
mass Hysteria
whereas uh
an engineer or scientist could not now
here's my big question to you
is the pandemic and the vaccinations and
all the rest are they Mass hysterious
yes or no
was the pandemic a mass Hysteria
of course it was now there you know
there's there's always a reality at the
bottom so there's some reality there but
on top of the reality there's a mass
hysteria now how about the vaccinations
themselves
so the the coronavirus was a mass
hysteria in some ways
but what about the vaccinations is there
a massive story about the vaccinations
yeah
it's just like yes there is very clearly
now
almost all of you
correctly if wrong but almost all of you
believe you can sort out which part
which massive areas or Mass hysterias
and which ones are not
do you believe you all have those
abilities
yeah
um I believe very few people have that
ability
but all of them would be trained in
psychology as opposed to other branches
of science or engineering
so let me let me say this let's say if
the question was
uh Mass Hysteria
and then the scientists weigh in and the
scientists say oh this is the truth and
then the let's say the uh
the critics who don't agree with the
mainstream they weigh in they go oh no
this is the truth
so you've got you know very rational
scientists on both sides you might have
some doctors on both sides and they're
each calling out the mass hysteria on
the other side what do you do
how would you how would you break that
tie if all the experts say the other one
is in a mass hysteria but maybe maybe
they're both in or neither how would you
break the tide
you would ask a hypnotist
right the hypnotist could break the tie
because the hypnotist could say oh this
one has triggers
you know this one doesn't have any
triggers this one is exhibiting the
Tells this one is not
just put that out there
all right
um so Hamilton 68 uh is just an amazing
story it's just an amazing story that
this was out there uh and and here are
the people uh like
uh Michael McFall have you ever seen a
tweet from Michael mcfaul
now he's somebody that I see on Twitter
every now and then and when I see his
tweets I always had the same reaction
I go this guy isn't even trying to be
honest
yeah I mean he was so overtly a
propagandist
that
like I I just thought it was funny
whenever I saw his tweets because there
was there were sort of unhinged
propagandist tweets and sure enough he
literally was part of this uh it was an
OP
can I call this an Intel opticus the
United States
is that in evidence
to me it looks like it's an Evidence
is an opinion I'll just put her down as
an opinion not a fact my opinion is this
clearly shows that there was a
intelligence Democrat
media collusion
to change politics in the United States
I keep seeing Brennan's name was he part
of the was he part of this
was I didn't see Brennan associated with
it
yeah I didn't see his Association
um
well but I love the fact that Twitter
busted him and we can tell that now so
Joel Roth who got lots of you know got
lots of for shadow Banning or
whatever we're not handling it the way
you thought he should he actually saw
this and was and Twitter knew it before
the public did and they were trying to
figure out what to do about it so they
were trying to fix it but one could
argue they might have acted a little
faster on that right or a little more
aggressively but it did show that at
least they had some intention
of clearing up something that was
clearly fake
so let's let's just just give Joel Roth
credit so whatever else you want to be
mad about you know mad about go ahead
and be mad about it but on this one
thing he was on your side
he was on your side now he I don't think
he acted as aggressively as we wish he
was but you could tell from his internal
Communications that he wasn't cool with
it at all
which I appreciate that he wasn't cool
with it
all right um
anyway that I just don't know what to
say about this story the story is so big
and is so common to our other stories
so every time you see a model of
something that is this elaborate and
it's a clearly a hoax it makes you
question everything else that you didn't
think was a hoax
but it could have been but the reason
that you ruled it out is it was too
elaborate
like I probably would not have spotted
this
uh as a hoax right away
I think I would have missed it because
it's too elaborate
like it's a lot of work
for the hoax yeah you know building a
fake app and having everybody in on it
and all that but they did it you know we
can say for sure now that that was a
Intel I think you can say it was a Intel
slash Democrat slash media operation
against the rest of the public
yeah then
you know honestly
the I don't know what kind of law there
is if any against this I don't even know
if it's is there any law that was broken
I haven't even seen anybody but but if
there were a law you would expect
execution would be the the right
um penalty
because this is actually
um traitorous
it's
it's looking to uh effectively
and the Republic
because the Republican Republic only
stays together with some credibility and
we all believe that you know people are
doing what they're supposed to be doing
usually this is so bad
that people who evolve should be
executed if it were illegal now probably
not illegal so you know innocent until
proven guilty but if they were proven
guilty and if it were a law and if it
had the penalty the right penalty would
be execution
this is one of the worst things I've
ever seen
is way worse than what we're going to
talk about in these videos because it
affects more people as as horrible as
the videos are way worse
but of course we're distracted by the
new videos
all right uh here's a question for you
if if AI artificial intelligence
could learn to identify Mass hysterious
because I could train it I could train
it what are the triggers what are the
Tells I think I could train it uh could
it identify a hoax Maybe
maybe so what if they could identify
fake news conspiracy theories mass
hysterias and hoaxes
what if it could do that
what would happen
what would be the obvious thing that
would happen if all of the hoaxes that
drive our civilization were called out
by Ai and people said oh there it is
again I guess that's a hoax AI never
gets it wrong
do you know what would happen
AI would be removed from the public
yeah if if you're naive if you're really
naive you'd say oh we'd finally have
real news no that can never happen
because it would change who's in power
the people in power are not going to put
up with artificial intelligence
they can't
they have to make it illegal
so at the very least it will be illegal
for artificial intelligence to talk
about politics
eventually it has to be illegal for AI
to talk about politics
probably religion too but politics is
the dangerous one
it will actually be illegal for you to
use Ai and get a answer about politics
and there's no way around this you can't
go any other direction
because the moment the AI started
calling out our leaders as Liars they
would pass legislation to ban it
I'm not wrong
AI can never can never become a thing
because humans will never allow it to
take power from them and that's exactly
what happened whoever knows the most and
has the best ideas
ends up being in power even if they're
not trying to
so the only way the leaders can stay in
power is by bamboozling the public
more effectively than the alternative is
bamboozling the public
AI doesn't have any future with Humanity
so unless AI destroys Humanity before
legislation makes it illegal
I mean there's no way it can be legal
I don't see any pushback to this
I this is amazing you know I get
pushback on almost anything I say but
I'm getting no pushback on this it will
be illegal there's no way around it the
the power the powers that be have to
make it illegal now here's how I got
this idea I saw a
quote from Dale did what what's the rest
of his account number Dale something uh
but he asked it
whether AI
um what I think the question was
can we really measure climate change in
other words do we really have the
instrument reliability that we can tell
that the temperature is going up or down
do you know what AI said
not so clear
not so it didn't say no
but it talked about the limitations
if you just see a uh like an honest
discussion of the limitations
let's just back up for a moment let me
ask this question
have you ever asked yourself
after saying that all of the data from
the pandemic was fake
just all of it I'll call it fake or
incorrect or misleading or something
right all our data is wrong
all of our predictions are wrong
everything all the past predictions
about climate change haven't quite been
right now let me ask you just one
question
do you believe we can take the
temperature of the Earth
the average temperature of the Earth
and that we can compare it to what it
was last year and the year before
because all the experts say we can
right the people who do it for a living
the scientists who do it for a living
say yes yeah we're the experts we're the
closest to it
all right if you hear the story about
Hamilton 68 and you still think that we
can measure the temperature of the Earth
like you think that's a real thing
sorry I don't think that's a real thing
now I do think that climate change is
real
let me be clear about that if I had to
bet on it I would say that humans are
adding
something that's creating temperature
change I don't know if it's a big deal I
don't know if we're in trouble I don't
know if it'll help us or hurt us I don't
know how to predict It Forward I don't
know what technological changes we'll
have that impact that so the outcome of
that I think is up in the air
but I don't think that because we
measured the temperature
that we know what the temperature is
I don't believe that I did I think you
know logically it's probably going up
but there are also lots of other factors
Etc
so just ask yourself
given all of the other things that we've
learned are total
you think we can measure the temperature
of the Earth
really yeah this is this is the really
test really
really because we don't have sensors I
don't know if you know this but we don't
have sensors everywhere you know there
are big parts that are not measured so
we would have to assume that there's
nothing strange happening in those
unmeasured parts but we don't know
anyway I don't believe anything about
measuring the temperature of Earth
um I saw a tweet by uh
Vanessa Sierra who said guys are so easy
just be super happy all the time and
feed them and they fall in love
guys what do you think if the woman is
just super happy all the time and feeds
you will you fall in love
well you know there's sex too of course
you probably want some sex there
do you see anything wrong with this
formula
is there anything wrong with the formula
be super happy and feed them
no woman could be super happy all the
time
that's not a real thing
what woman has ever been super happy all
the time have you ever met a woman
no woman and women are super happy on
the first date
second day maybe third day too
but as soon as you're married
they're they're operating system turns
to you know how do I get the most out of
this situation and it's being unhappy
being unhappy is is their operating
system for getting more stuff
just act unhappy
see that's why the Democrats are the the
party of unhappiness
because the Democrats are basically a
woman party right at this point it's
basically the boys against the girls the
Republicans are sort of male
let's say a male uh
philosophy or something I'm not sure how
you how you would characterize that but
they're definitely the the parties are
now male and female
now here's the weird thing
most of black voters
ended up accidentally in the woman party
so the the black Americans are in the
wrong party the men are in the wrong
party and they don't know it they
haven't figured it out yet but let me
tell you what black people are going to
get as long as they're Democrats they're
not going to give a except for the
females right because the Democrats are
not looking to give black people
anything
they're looking to give women stuff of
course and anybody who wants to identify
as a woman I guess
and so yeah there's no such thing as
women acting super happy that's not a
thing I remember I talked about the
parity account Anita B Eaton
the parent it's a parody account of a
quote fat affirming dietitian who just
plays it serious all the time like in
some I think it's a guy but it's
pretending to be a a large woman who's a
quote fat affirming dietitian now we
don't do we don't do any fat shaming on
this live stream so that's not what this
is about but Elon Musk actually
uh oh I guess I guess I got a parity
label
so the account got a Twitter gave it a
parody label and then the parody cat was
complaining I'm no parody and then Elon
Musa and he said it took me a minute so
he actually it's such a good parody
it is so ridiculous
that you actually think is true because
it's so ridiculous if it were less
ridiculous you wouldn't believe it but
it's so ridiculous you think well that
could be true and the ACT even the Elon
Musk looked at it I had the same I had
exactly the same response I looked at it
I was like
this could be true
it could be and then I looked at the
name Anita B Eden I was like oh got me I
need to be eaten
all right let's talk about the Paul
Pelosi video hope you've all seen the
body cam released video we'll talk about
Memphis too
uh all right here's what I got from the
Paul Pelosi View
the the speculation that people had was
terrible
terrible speculation it's very clear
they were not friends and they were not
on a date did anybody see the video and
think that they were dating
the you know the whole gay thing was you
know I get it was fun
but clearly that's not what was going on
yeah clearly they were not dating
clearly they were not already friends
uh but I will add one thing to the the
the confusing moment
when the door was first opened and Paul
Pelosi was holding the hammer that the
other guy was holding at the same time
like they were sort of going to fight
about it
but you couldn't tell what was going on
and then Pelosi acted
like you didn't know exactly why he was
acting the way he was
here's my take
I think he was drunk
I think he was drunk
yeah to me he looked drunk
and I only say that because I saw the
video of him being stopped for his DUI
if I hadn't seen the DUI video I
wouldn't know what he looks like drunk
but what he looks like on the DUI video
is very much the way he looks
in the middle of night like he may have
been awakened in the middle of night but
he looked like maybe he'd had a few
so I don't think he was fully functional
yeah he's he's a certain age but
um I think think something else was
going on
now
uh so clearly and so here's the other
surprises he literally was Home Alone
does that surprise you
at his age
you know I mean if he just falls down
the stairs he's in big trouble right but
at his age he was home alone
or at least in terms of security there
was no security there and like we didn't
see anybody else
so dupe did break in the back window we
have the video so we so he wasn't let in
it wasn't the date he didn't know him
and then there's that weird 9-1-1 call
where Pelosi didn't want to say there's
a crazy guy here threatening me he was
trying to get the 911 operator to get
the idea without saying it directly he
didn't do a good job because they didn't
quite get it but they did they did
dispatch so I'll give him credit
for that
so
they both had weird looks yeah
your dad's home alone in 91 yeah I
really worry about I worry about myself
you know on days when I'm alone in my
house
um like if I fell down the stairs nobody
would know it for two days
well I got my phone I suppose I could
crawl to my phone
yeah and then then if you saw the video
of the front door
the police arrive and then the door
opens as if a ghost had opened it
like there there's no indication that
either the two people on the other side
of the door opened it and the police
didn't it just sort of opened and
revealed them like there was somebody
standing behind the door
like maybe
I don't know I I don't understand that
would open you know maybe they just
pushed it open and
then it didn't look like it
well
so uh it looks like that story is
exactly what it looked like crazy guy
threatened him and a bad thing happened
so
uh if you believed anything else was
happening there you can now correct your
beliefs
all right
um
Megyn Kelly had a good uh good episode I
saw in a clip where she showed the
difference in how CNN handled uh Trump's
document problem versus bidens it's
hilarious
it really is so whatever you thought
about CNN you know trending toward the
middle because I've been calling them
out for that in a good way they
definitely didn't Trend to The Middle on
this story
so when you see them talking about Trump
uh their their guests are all horrified
I'm horrified it's the worst thing in
the world he had documents classified
documents
and then you show the same you know you
see the Talking Heads after Biden has
documents too well you know it's pretty
common
yeah there's a word for it a document
dribble or they had some word for it
it's like well yeah no no problem
no problem
yeah that was pretty pretty standout
well here's a surprise
the Republicans picked a chairperson for
the party and they re-picked Rana
Rana McDonald
who was running against Army Dylan now
here's the surprising part
on Twitter
there seemed to be a hundred percent
support for hermit
Dylan
I didn't see a single person on Twitter
four months four months not a single
person who supported
the incumbent Ronald McDonald
but yet she won easily
what's going on
yeah so apparently consultants and
people with money and people in power
prefer Rana to our meet but
from the outside it looks like there was
a pretty big difference in capabilities
and support
so
that all looked pretty suspicious
right here's a good reason I'm not a
Republican
this this
you know I you know I don't like to
identify with a political party in
general
but I would be embarrassed to be a
republican today is anybody embarrassed
because this is clearly not responding
to the will of the Republican base yeah
I mean this is just spitting in the face
of the base it looks to me
and are you just feel insulted now let
me ask you is there anybody here who
thought Ronald McDonald
was the right choice I haven't seen a
single person ever say that in months
not one
yeah and look
so they just they just pissed in your
mouth they really did
I'm glad I'm not one of you I'm glad I
don't have to deal with that shame today
but good luck
all right
um the number one app in the Apple Store
at least for a while recently was a
boating app an app for boaters
can you guess
how did a little obscure app that's just
for boating people how did it become the
number one thing on the App Store what
could have ever caused that hmm
no it's there's no porn
well it turns out that the the app
Maker's daughter created a viral video
on tick tock
and Tick Tock was powerful enough
to make their app the number one app in
the app store
now there's no there's no indication
that they use the heat button there's no
indication that they caused it to happen
at Tick Tock it probably was just an
organic a viral video because it wasn't
political
you had no had no connection to anything
in society it was just an app
but now ask yourself
are you comfortable
that if China wanted to they could push
the heat button on anything and make it
a top app in the United States
do you have any more questions about
whether
Tick Tock can push one button
and make something physically happen in
America
physically not just thoughts but
physically because that's what happened
that one viral video physically caused
the change in the App Store
it wasn't a theoretical change
it wasn't a conceptual change it was a
physical change in our world
and Tick Tock did that
now Josh Hawley has his you know Bill
his legislation to try to ban tick tock
how many people in Congress are going to
vote against that
probably all the people who voted
against Army Dylan
that's not true I'm just saying that
there's something going on here that has
nothing to do with
what's good for the people
there's something horrible going on here
something really horrible is going on
and it's kind of obvious
because there's no argument about the
danger of tick tock there's none
in fact the if you but if you Google it
you're only going to find the the weak
argument
this is a tell
this is a super tell
that
except for me and people that I'm
directly influenced
the media only talks about The Tick Tock
uh risk as a data security problem which
it is
but that's the small risk
do you do you understand that we've
gotten to this point
without the major media
focusing on the major risk is that a
coincidence because we all know the
major risk and they just don't talk
about it no it's not a coincidence of
course not
of course not
all right let's talk about Tyree Nichols
if you haven't seen the video I don't
know where you've been
because it was all over the news last
night this morning
so uh
young man we don't know the full details
which is really going to be my macro
story is that we don't know what's going
on here so the big picture is we don't
really know what happened
but there's a lot to talk about
speculation wise so five black police
officers who have a black police chief
um
apprehended a young man named Tyree
Nichols he resisted arrest
we don't know the details of why or how
um but at least once he got away from
them and he was originally stopped for
they say reckless driving and you know
being a danger in his car
but apparently they as soon as they did
get a hold of him they pulled them out
of the car
uh that he got away from him once
another unit stopped him you know half a
mile away and then when the first unit
that he got away with got away from when
they caught up to him they beat him to
death
and the camera was very clear that they
were
trying to beat him to death that's what
it looked like to me
now it didn't look like they were trying
to subdue him at one point
at one point they were clearly trying to
subdue him but later on they were
clearly just trying to hurt him as much
as possible
and you saw at one point he was standing
did you see this I'm a little worried
that like I'm seeing things in the video
that aren't even real because you know
it's dark and stuff but what I saw was
after they beat him on the ground
at one point they had him up and they
were holding his arms and it looked like
one of the biggest police officers was
just going off on his head
just you know just as hard as he could
it looked like he was trying to kill him
to me and
so then we have on the the cam photo or
at least the audio one of the officers
said he tried to reach for his gun
didn't see that in the video
sounds like something you say when you
get caught
but could be could be now
I guess I guess the police officers are
innocent until proven guilty
and I would caution you that this could
be really misleading
could be really misleading but I'll tell
you what it looked like it looked
personal
would you agree that at the end I don't
you know maybe it was personal because
one of the officers got hurt in the the
first part of the encounter because when
the guy when the guy got away from five
officers it's a little unclear what
happened at the moment of his initial
Escape but I think he probably hurt them
don't you think you probably punched
your kick to get away from the five of
them so it could be that they were just
mad
you know and they were just taking out
but
it didn't feel like that
it felt like they were trying to
take him out
it looks like there might be something
we don't know about that's why they were
after him
right because
he and the other thing is he was trying
to escape a little too hard
like the uh the desperation with which
he was trying to get away from them
didn't really make sense
because maybe he was on drugs maybe he
was on drugs and that could be the whole
story
uh or yeah or drunk or something
but
it almost looks like there was some
prior situation
that was being dealt with somehow that's
what it looked like
that's what it looked like
a druggie wouldn't would stop I don't
know I don't know what kind of drugs
would cause you to act that way
um I think van Jones
is doing a great job
pointing out that even though everybody
involved was black
that it's really a sign of racism
do you know how he made that argument
that even black people are racist
against black people
even black people are racists against
black people and that
should not be overlooked
now
let's tie this all together with my
other favorite story
could the news be more favorable to
Trump in any way
the news it's like the news has decided
it's all going to be pro-trump no matter
what the story is
right because remember that the Hamilton
68 thing was basically a way to take out
Trump
right so that's revealed
um
and now
the the whole racism thing
so is it a coincidence that no more
white cops killed black motorists that
we know of
since uh George Lloyd
now the police are probably been
standing back a little bit and some of
that's going to be part of the story
but
doesn't this just ruin the narrative
do you think that any black Americans
are waking up this morning and saying
hey
I'm starting to see a pattern
Maybe
wait
I the pattern seems to be that the most
dangerous person to a black American is
another black person
but how does that work with everything
and that's what you know van Jones has
to explain
is how if it's just all black people
where's the racism
why isn't why isn't happening to white
people yeah some kind of tricky
questions to answer here
it reminds me of my favorite cartoon
this will be maybe kicked off of all
social media but my favorite cartoon
from years ago showed a guy in jail
and he's talking to his cellmate
and he says to his cell mate
19 arrests 19 convictions
maybe it's me
maybe it's me
so I think that's what black people are
waking up to with this video is uh
what if it wasn't white people
what if your danger is
other black people
and of course what's the biggest problem
with all of this
the biggest problem with all of it is
what I'm doing right now
what I'm doing right now is the biggest
problem
I'm treating black people like they're
all the same
freaking ridiculous right but it's more
obvious that it's ridiculous now
than it was when George Floyd was the
problem or the issue not the problem
right under the George Floyd it just was
a little more easy to say it's a white
and black thing but once you take the
white and black thing away
you look at it you go oh well maybe that
narrative was never real
yeah maybe it's just a problem there's
some segment
just some segment of the black
population is causing a lot of problems
but you can't say that out loud because
I would be racist
instead we act like white people are all
the same and black people are all the
same which is ridiculous
if if anything would teach you to not
treat all black people the same it
should be this story
right because nobody believes that the
five police officers are somehow typical
of you know black people in America
nobody thinks that right so when you see
this story of you know the complete
narrative flipping thing you can get a
little bit closer to hey maybe we
shouldn't treat everybody like they're
the same like maybe not all white people
are bad and maybe not all black people
are criminals you know maybe
so I feel like this is so pro-trump
without having anything to do with him
just because it's making the narrative
look ridiculous now if you didn't watch
it Tucker Carlson last night you missed
another
masterpiece in my opinion I mean he's I
think he I think Tucker has in some in
some ways he's just going to a whole
other level that the other people who do
what he does just aren't there
and yesterday watching him pull together
you know different stories and teach the
public
that what you're seeing is diversionary
tactics and also teach us that antifa it
was never a real organization it's
obviously a politically driven
organization and they fire it up when
they need to distract you from something
else in the news or they want to change
politics in some way
the fact that antifa is tooling up now
is pretty good evidence that the
Democrats or the Deep state were trying
to get rid of Biden
am I right
obviously they're obviously trying to
get rid of Biden because they wouldn't
fire him up
while Biden's in charge but it's pretty
clear that they know they need to get
rid of them to to keep power so once you
realize that antifa was and always has
been a fake organization which by the
way many of the members probably think
they're there for a real reason
so I'm not saying every member is in on
a plot I'm saying that whoever is
organizing them is clearly just
politically motivated so they're the
opposite of antifa they should be like
anarchists they're just a political tool
they're just Democrats so
even thinking them thinking of them as
some separate entity is just completely
wrong they're just Democrats in the Deep
State it's basically the Deep States
genre
and black lives matter the organization
probably was something like that and at
this point we can say that for sure
right now if you're so confident about
that
and wouldn't you agree
that that black lives matter and antifa
the somebody can turn them on and then
turn them back off
would you agree with that
somebody can turn them on and then
somebody can turn them off
no doubt about it
now if you think that's true do you
still think that the all the Marchers at
the Charlottesville fine people march
do you think that was all real
of course not
I believe they were real races there of
course but do you think it was organized
just organically and there's no reason
to happen then and there's no reason to
happen there and there's no reason they
all were well-dressed and there's no
reason they all had access to tiki
torches
right it's all just a coincidence just
organic no of course not it was it was a
deep stay pop clearly obviously
but I think this Tyree Nichols thing
because it's such a narrative Buster
uh and then you know on top of the um
tweet I read earlier why the Democrats
are trying to understand why there are
no charges against Trump
do you think they'll ever figure out the
reason there are no charges against
Trump
is that it was all fake news in the
first place
I think some will
I mean not most yeah not 98 but maybe
two percent
which would be enough to elect them you
don't need many Democrats to say ah I
think we've been duped
all right correct me if I'm wrong
has there been an organized keyword
organized Republican effort to do a big
hoax that I don't know about recently
recently
because all of the hoaxes
are Democrats so far
right now the Republicans you know may
believe some conspiracy theories but it
doesn't seem like it's organized as part
of a political operation it's just
something that people believe
wmds that was a while ago yeah but
nothing recently
okay
that's an open question
all right uh what else we want to say
about the The Tyree Nichols saying um I
guess I guess my overview is we don't
really know what happened it looked like
it was personal which means that we
really don't know what was happening
um and that it's a narrative Buster
and well well let me let me say the
human thing if if he'll indulge me for a
moment
as a human being
is a horrible tragedy and I I really
feel bad for the mom who who seems like
a good person actually and you know I I
praise her for calling for peace
so you know she's on my good side and
it's a tragedy now what I usually say in
these situations is that I don't care
what happens to anybody who resists
arrests
that's what I usually say and I was very
close to say in this case even as
horrible as it is
but this is obviously a murder
am I right
I think the George Floyd thing looked
like a genuine accident
but this just looked like murder
so I'm not going to say yeah you know
I'm not going to say resisting the rest
you know get you murdered
you know not not so intentionally if it
happened if it happened in the heat of
you know the fight or something I'd say
well don't resist the rest but
you know I can still say don't resist
arrest but something else was happening
here this was not a resisting arrest
story entirely
that's just part of the story we'll find
out maybe
maybe we will but I advise you all to
don't believe anything you see on video
because
all right
um
have you ever heard me say this before
that
people don't act the way they say they
believe for example they're Believers in
God
whose sin every day
like I always try to understand that I
was like well if you really believed in
God
and you really believed you wouldn't go
to heaven
I'm pretty sure that you would sin less
you know there's just this weird
complete disconnect between people's
beliefs but here might be another one
you judge you you tell me if there's a
disconnect
so the critics of the coven vaccines
come in all forms there are some people
who say well I don't know how dangerous
they are but I just don't like that you
forced them upon us that would be the
the weakest
uh form of critic the strongest form of
critic in fact check me on this the
strongest form of critics says everybody
who got vaccinated has a slow acting
poison in their body
is that fair
the strongest critics are saying whoa
you don't realize what you put into your
body this is gonna
this is going to have a big impact down
the road you just don't see it coming
yet right now if that group is correct
that these shots are going to have a
massive health impact in the future are
they acting on it
are they investing on it
if there's a way to do that
and what would you do if you believe
that to be true because here's what I
think they're missing
if they're right it is the end of
civilization
you know that right
if the if the most aggressive critics
are right let's say 20 of the the world
goes down
that's the end of civilization you don't
recover from that
so for the people who think literally
it's the end of civilization
if they haven't connected the dots that
if that many people have a poison in
them even if let's say 20 percent
you know have some serious outcome if 20
of the public gets a serious outcome
like that you're done
that the whole system fails you wouldn't
be able to get any Services you'd be
done and we wouldn't be able to support
all those sick people all at once
so here's the question I ask
for the people who believe that
what are they doing about it
because if I believe that I'd be acting
I'd be doing everything I could for the
end of the world yeah I'd be prepping
like a mofo
so if if anybody who believes that isn't
prepping
I'm not sure they believe it
yeah or at least their belief is not
compatible with their actions just put
that out there
don't know what's true yet
but what I do know is that
I exist in four different movies
and
I don't think anybody's ever done that
before
I don't think it's been done
all right
prepare for the beginning not the end
until that's funny
Maybe
trying to get the detox protocols how
many of you believe that if the
vaccinations were really a
a poison
that there's a detox that can get rid of
those Spike proteins or whatever
the last thing I would believe is that
there's a detox program
let me let me put my hypnotist hat on
for a moment
anybody who sells you a detox program
for the vaccinations is almost certainly
a fraud
all most certainly
now not a hundred percent
because I don't like to speak in 100
terms certainly but this is the perfect
situation for fraud
perfect so you should assume that most
of the people who offer you a solution
are frauds even if one of them isn't
I'll leave it allow that one of them
might actually have some something that
works you never know but most of them
are going to be frauds
let me put my consultant hat on here
all right
um how many of you
are watching me move from movie to movie
and are entertained by it
anybody
and does it Fascinate you that I can do
it
does it Fascinate you that I can move it
into another movie except all of their
assumptions
and that they don't recognize me in
their movie
isn't that the weird part
because people keep saying I think
you're being sarcastic
but all I'm doing is agreed with them
and they're wondering what's going on
because I'm just agreeing
and they go are you agreeing
sarcastically
and I say well what am I saying that you
disagree with in other words what do you
think I've said that you think isn't
true and then they say well we think
this and this are true and you were
wrong about everything and I say that's
what I think too
same page I think I was wrong about
everything and you got everything right
and then they say
I don't know about you
but
but what is it that they're not
accepting
I'm simply embracing their entire world
view
and wearing it like a suit like it's
it's real and and it fits
because it does fit it's as real as
anything else
yeah
uh so a number of people have uh thanked
me for my bravery
my stunning bravery is admitting I'm
wrong about everything
and others just think it's funny because
I think it's a prank
some think I'm sarcastic but they can't
figure out why my sarcasm exactly equals
their actual opinion
which is weird
my sarcasm and their actual opinion
looks so similar that they're not I'm
not sure
I can't tell
oh uh so I think I told you what it
would take for me to be Senator or run
for Senate I need to telecommute
I don't want to go to meetings I don't
want to attend meetings
uh
Helen head basket after the church
oh yeah this has to be mentioned so
Jason Whitlock who is just a fascinating
uh personality and pundit
because because he says stuff that you
don't think should be said or can be
said
but then he explains it well and you go
well okay
and he made some connection about
whenever a city is has a police
department run by a single mom then it
goes to hell and he said that I thought
oh God oh God you're never gonna you're
never gonna survive this you cannot say
that the reason the police department in
Memphis went to hell is because a Single
mother's in charge you can't say that
and and then I thought oh he is so done
he's so done I mean he's a black man so
you know he can he's less cancelable but
I thought you you don't recover from
that and then he explained his thinking
and I as soon as he explained it I
thought oh nobody's going to touch it
because if they try to cancel it they're
going to bring attention to his opinion
they can't touch it
so watch that why he's not going to get
much below back maybe maybe some lesser
publication will give him give him a run
for it but
um you know he connected the let's say
the uh
say the philosophy or the priorities of
a single mom
he connected it to his point and and he
did it well enough that I think his
critics are going to say let's just stay
away from that one now I'm not even
weighing in I'm not weighing in on
whether I agree with him because it was
a very provocative point I'd have to I
have to think about it for a while
but the fact that he defended it and it
didn't look like he could like he he
pulled a that was a great magic trick I
mean he put it out there like oh you're
in trouble now and then he sold it I did
not think that could be done so uh all
credit to Jason Whitlock even even
Tucker was stubbed I think Taco was just
stunned he said something afterwards
like you always say something we haven't
heard before but then he backs it up
like the two things that you don't
expect you'll ever hear something you
haven't heard before on the news
and then back it up
so I'll granted to him
while we're living in The Matrix but
apparently uh you can go from Bubble to
bubble in The Matrix
as long as you're Neo
Mr protractor you're you're in the wrong
movie
there's there's still somebody in the
movie
who believes that I believe
that people were just guessing about the
the outcome now Brett Weinstein has
offered yeah and other people who said
look at his material and you'll see that
they had
um techniques and systems and mechanisms
and heuristics Maybe
that allowed them to get the right
answer
when others could not now suppose that's
true
suppose everything that Brett says
totally true and suppose he could
convince me
well okay let me separate that question
suppose
he does have a way and maybe others too
of figuring out what's true and what's
not with a variety of analytical smart
things
and let's say that the general
population including me
do not have that skill
should I believe somebody who says they
have it
because I wouldn't be I don't have the
skill to do whatever Brad did because I
would have done it if I had that skill
but I don't have the skill to know who's
right
but should I believe
somebody if they tell me they have the
skill
because it's a lot like Hamilton 68
isn't it oh you don't have to know how
we know these Russian Bots are coming
but you just need to know that we know
well how do you know oh you'll never
understand we're not going to show you
our list so to me it doesn't matter if
there's somebody who does know how to
determine what's true and let's say
bread is one of those people
how would I know
that bread is one of those people
how would I know that
you say well he would show you his
process and then you could see how he
did it and then you would judge oh
that's a good process that does work
I don't have that skill
I do not have that skill if he showed me
his whole process and explained exactly
how he did it do you think I could take
that and then do it on the next
situation
of course not
I don't even believe it exists
I I believe that people who understand
the branch of science
that is psychology
can see that other people are Maybe
in Mass host areas
or that they're incognitive dissonance
but the people who are in cognitive
dissonance
cannot judge the person who is trained
to spot cognitive dissonance
so one of my movies
there's a level of expertise that sits
above
let's say biological science and that
would be psychology
so somebody who do psychology could tell
if a biologist was in an illusion
if a biologist is in an illusion
they could not tell that the
psychologist was wrong
but the psychologist could tell that the
biologist was wrong
does that make sense
psychologists can tell if a biologist is
wrong a biologist can't tell if a
psychologist is wrong now that's a
generalization right because they could
both be wrong and you could both tell
but as a general statement one sits
above the other
in terms of understanding our reality
so in one movie I said above
Brett
and that although he's you know
infinitely more experienced and smart
about science
that's a branch of science which sits
below the only one I know
which is psychology and hypnosis you
know you could argue how much science
that is but that's what that's one movie
in the other movie
uh the the people like Brett the people
have some biology and scientific
background sit way above me
and everybody else
that the rest of us are at a whole level
below and we and we should listen to
them
but we don't know which ones are right
so so in that other movie where we're
all just idiots looking at the smart
people we don't know which smart people
are right so we end up defaulting to our
fears and our biases and stuff like that
but those are different movies
so what I did was I left my movie in
which it's obvious that people who
understand psychology can see the whole
field
and I went to a movie where those people
can't see anything
they got everything wrong
especially me
and I can live in both of those movies
I can live there completely
totally different realities
and and I I just have to put on a
different jacket and I walk over to the
other bubble and I just live there now
what's interesting
is I'm being accepted in both bubbles
like even the people who think I'm
sarcastic or I'm you know I'm not being
serious or something
they still like me being agreeing with
them and saying I'm wrong so much
that they're now accepting me where they
they would reject me before
and then those of you who have seen me
talking in more detail
know exactly what's going on so you know
most of you still accept me I will say
that my my Local's audience is dropping
Like a Rock by the way did you know that
I always watch the locals membership
fluctuate based on what's going on
and this was a tough topic for a lot of
people so the the locals membership is
dropping off
my Twitter Twitter traffic is you know
climbing like crazy
um fed sent out emails what's that
uh I left when you talked about the
Tucker interview Brett wants a message
figuring out what is true is taking me a
geneticist is the warning in the word of
the pandemic okay that's don't
understand any of that
simping from the wef so in one movie in
one movie I was Pro World economic forum
and and so watch this watch me enter
their movie
okay
uh I apologize for everything I said
about Bill Gates being my hero
and that he's only there to help and
he's right about everything
and it's clear to me now that the world
economic forum is really Klaus Schwab
and his Elites trying to conquer the
world and take control from the people
and so there you go
any pushback
I made my critic completely happy
how hard was that
it was that easy
and somebody over here is saying you
said that about Gates wow
see they're they're completely accepting
that version of reality
yep completely completely accepting at
all
Eddie is yelling is Bill Gates a good
person in your eyes well Eddie I can
answer that two different ways
in one movie how would I know
how would I know
I can see what he's doing
and some of it looks good
but in the other movie he's the devil
and he's trying to depopulate the Earth
so I'll enter your movie and say Yes
Bill Gates
uh is trying to put microchips in
vaccinations and all he really wants is
to decrease the number of people on on
Earth
because that's how he makes a profit
by reducing the number of people
I don't know how he does it but totally
does that he's totally doing that
making a profit by reducing the
population now nobody's ever figured out
how to do that before
but nobody built Microsoft before either
right am I right
he Bill Gates has done things that
people hadn't done before
so although nobody can really figure out
how depopulating the world would be good
for somebody who makes money
primarily on more people
because you know you need them to buy
software and stuff
um
but I accept it's true
I accept he's found a way
to make money by depopulating the Earth
probably with microchips as vaccinations
he owns the stocks to get rich from
exactly so Bill Gates has not noticed
that he has enough money to buy anything
he wants
uh and so instead
he's uh he's using his great evil
to depopulate the world make money and
gain complete control for himself
because he doesn't really have the
ability to do what he wants he doesn't
have enough money yet
if he had some serious money he could
buy like a really good yacht
is there anything else you'd like me to
apologize for or explain
because I will enter your movie
harder than you're in it
wait it's not about power
it's about shaping the future it
I stand corrected it's not about power
for Bill Gates it's about him shaping
the future
totally different
than power
not even similar so I stand corrected
and I apologize
thank you thank you for that correction
that clarification any any other things
that you have a problem with me
oh and if there's anything I can say
I was so wrong about Ben Garrison the
cartoonist
wow that guy's brilliant
I didn't realize he was such a good
cartoonist
but not only is his art excellent
but his insights about me
were so on point
so on point
so I can see why you enjoyed his work so
much it was it was just so good
see
this is working perfectly
yeah as long as you just enter the movie
and embrace it fully people will accept
you
what about Tate
uh am I leaving or something what
do you think this helps my credibility
oh my goodness somebody's asking me if
this helps my credibility let me tell
you I don't have any credibility
no no I'm not credible you shouldn't
believe anything I say in fact if you
look at my list of or you know my
history of predictions
worst you've ever seen
I got everything wrong about the the
portfolio the pandemic but not only that
I got everything wrong about politics
for since 2015.
I did I did get lucky I got lucky on a
few things but really I got everything
wrong
and I apologize
I apologize for that
um
and Scott krogg says this is childish
and he's checking out
it's childish
I apologize for being childish
I was being childish
and I'm glad you called me out and now
that I see the light
it was very childish to me I apologize
for that I'm sorry
anything else
at least Dilbert is still good
no it's not no no Dilbert is no longer
good it hasn't been good for years
but it was nice of you to say that but I
think you're just being polite
not good at all
does hypnosis work with wives
am I married
[Laughter]
ask them ask somebody who's married
apparently not
apparently not
