good morning everybody and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to you and to anybody not only in the
real world but in your imagination
the metaverse and everyone else
everywhere else you can imagine it's
just the best thing that's ever happened
it's called coffee with scott adams and
it features the simultaneous sip
what do you need for that well you need
a cup or a mug or a glass of tango
chelsea steiner canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
really except china install the
simultaneous stuff it happens now go
yeah yeah that's good
i think that makes my memes more
delicious
all right i have a weird
left field question for you
has anybody discovered that there's an
exact temperature
mostly for indoor living
at which your body shuts down
and your brain doesn't work and even you
can't even you can't even have sex
like your body will move
for me it's exactly 76 degrees
somebody says 58 degrees their brain
shuts down
[Laughter]
yeah now i assume that there's lots of
individual difference but i've been
tracking this forever
and at 76 degrees i can't think
and i i can't even like i can't even
have sex at any age you know it's not
even age-related but it's 76 i can't
function
now i would recommend if you've never
noticed
that there's a temperature where it just
falls off a ledge and here's the
interesting thing
at least in my case
it's not like 74 degrees i start feeling
it because i don't
it's like 76 degrees i'll be sitting
there thinking i can't do anything
and i'll get up and i'll go to the the
thermometer and check
it's always 76 degrees and has been for
years and years
and so anyway i'll just put that out
there as a helpful tip
if you feel yourself shutting down
just go check the temperature
and then check it again
every time you feel that feeling where
you just can't think just can't get
anything done can't
can't do anything yeah humidity would be
part of the answer too so where i am it
tends to be lower humidity so maybe my
temperature is always more consistent
all right i got a little story for you
yesterday
uh
christina my wife and i went to an a
small afghan
food market
locally i'd never been there before
and here was our experience we got our
little ingredients that we're going to
make some
kind of amazing soup i guess
and
christina gets in line and i'm just sort
of hanging around with her
and uh
we're the only ones in line right there
are two cash registers but only one of
them has somebody attending
and
we get in line at the one cash register
and the guy indicates that we should
move to the other cash register
so we didn't really know why but
it doesn't really matter why because
there was nobody nobody in line so we
just walk over to the empty cash
register
assuming that either that man will walk
over and help us or somebody else will
soon be there
but instead
we just sort of waited there and here's
the weird thing
meanwhile
a whole line forms at the other cash
register
the one where he just said he's not
going to help us
and he starts waiting on people
and it's one person after another and
there's like this long line
and he's waiting on them
but he told us not to be there we have
to be at this other cash register with
nobody at it
does anybody know why
yeah some of you already guessed
it was a man at the cash register
and christine is a woman
you wouldn't wait on her
we had to go to the special woman-only
cash register
and
when we were waiting i was waiting you
know shoulder to shoulder with her as if
either of us were
the customer
and when i finally figured out what was
going on because there's a woman in
traditional islamic garb came to our
casual cash register
and as soon as she did i looked at the
other line and i realized it was all men
have you ever been in a grocery store
with a long line at the cash register
that was only men
it's the first time i've ever seen it
and
they literally wouldn't wait on her they
wouldn't take her money because she was
a woman
she had her woman had to be taken by
another woman so now i'm standing at the
cash register and the woman in islamic
garb walks up
and i you know i'm the one with the
wallet you know she christina wasn't
carrying her wallet at the moment
so i've got to pay
but i can't pay this woman
so how do you buy your food
so obviously i gave the i gave the
credit card to uh christina
and just you know backed away from the
situation out of respect and so
christina paid and everything was fine
but i never quite have you ever
experienced that
and i i have to admit
that i didn't feel
put out by it
which is strange
because you would imagine that i would
be yeah here's what i felt
i just felt that i had
entered another culture
and i was actually quite quite happy to
conform to their preferences
so i didn't have any problem with it at
all because i understood it to be
important to them
if it's important to them
it's no big deal for me of course i'm
going to be respectful for it
so it's not my business how they do
their business now
i mentioned that the the the woman
didn't seem to have a problem with it i
i don't know i don't order
i don't know what her private feelings
were
but uh they seemed happy so i didn't
have a problem with it anyway i you
would think i would i imagine if it were
more inconvenient i would but
um
i think people
people can be people and we could
respect that
anyway um here i'm going to add to my
npc spotting list
here's how you can tell you're dealing
with a non-player character
someone who isn't not capable of
independent thought
i've told you before that if they
mention the matrix movie or soylent
green movie
uh they're probably an npc but i'm gonna
add jumping the shark
when when used in the wrong way
which is anybody who has a new idea
anybody who does anything different will
you jump in the show right now
npc
because everybody's doing new stuff all
the time
everybody isn't jumping the shark
sometimes there's progress
i wouldn't even be doing what i'm doing
now if i hadn't jumped the shark right
from cartoonist to
i don't know whatever i am now
i mean jumping the shark is what you
should all be doing looking to get out
of your domain try something risky etc
i'm going to take a little aside here
and give you some advice
that will completely change the
experience of some of you
just a few
maybe five percent
the rest of you just watch just just
watch this experience okay
how many of you
have a problem with uh
sadness or let's say depression but
maybe not the
full clinical kind
for which i don't have any answers
but you know you're depressed as you use
the word commonly but let's say not in
the full medical sense where you
literally can't get out of bed how many
of you have days like that all of you
right you have phases like that periods
like that
let me give you a way out
okay
if you're just in the doldrums there's
just nothing good going on you just
can't find a way to get happy
here's your way out
increase your risk
do something that you wouldn't do
unless you knew you were going to be
dead tomorrow
live your life
like you know you're going to be dead
tomorrow
because if you're unhappy
you might as well be dead tomorrow right
the whole point of life is to get some
enjoyment out of it if you're not
getting enjoyment at life
ramp up your risk
now when i say risk i don't mean
physical risk you know don't don't do
extreme sports necessarily and maybe for
some of you
but do the thing that you weren't going
to do before
walk up to that person that you were too
afraid to ask out
and get shot down
remember
imagine that you're going to be dead
tomorrow
do you mind that you got turned down for
a date
well not if you're going to be dead
tomorrow
no
no it doesn't matter
you can change your frame
from oh everything's bad and i'm in a
bad mood too wait a minute i just got a
free pass
to do all the scary things i couldn't do
before
for about five percent of you that
changed your life
the rest of you were wondering i don't
know would that work without
five percent of you
just changed your life
i guarantee it
just tell yourself you're not sad you
just got a free pass
to do things you couldn't do before
because what's the difference what's the
downside
is it going to make you sad
nope you're already sad
have i told you before that when i have
a bad day like you know you have these
bad days you know it's going to pass but
you're having a really bad day you just
have to get through it
when i have a bad day
i fire people that i wanted to fire
anyway
right now if you work for me i'm not
planning to fire anybody
i'm talking in general
in general i do unpleasant things when
i'm already feeling bad because that's
the perfect combination i'm not going to
feel any worse i might as well do those
things that i knew were going to make me
feel bad because it won't make me feel
any worse it's already a bad day
so same
the same
strategy
if you're sad sad sad and you just can't
get out of it go do something that you
were scared shitless of
five minutes ago
scare the out of yourself see what
happens
one time men of i don't know three or
five something great might happen and
the other times at least you'll wake
yourself up
so
give that a try
anyway um
are you watching the story about uh
congresswoman robert
so she told the joke in public that was
filmed
in which she suggested that elon omar um
you know might be a terrorist
you know that was the essence of the
joke details don't matter
now she ended up apologizing but people
had some opinions about whether she
should have it's a common opinion on the
right to say you should never apologize
because then you'll just be apologizing
for everything all the time and you're
basically giving power to the people who
demand apologies
and i i have some sympathy for that i
think that's a reasonably good
trump-like strategy
you know i'm big on apologies if the
issue doesn't matter
right if you can make a in your personal
life if you can make something go away
with an apology go ahead and do it
but politically
i think apologies probably are just a
transfer of power for no reason
um
but here's my take on this
did we conflate our standard for how we
treat public figures with how we would
treat each other
because that's not the same
if a
if a public figure told a joke about you
a private citizen
suggesting that you were a terrorist
because of your ethnicity well that
would be pretty bad
that would be pretty bad
you don't want your public servants
elected officials
to be you know mocking private citizens
for their ethnicity even if it's a joke
right there's no joke that's going to be
funny enough
this is going to be okay for our elected
officials to make fun of a private
citizen for ethnicity anyway right
but
that's not the standard we use for other
elected officials
you can say basically anything about an
elected official
how many times has trump been called
hitler
how many times have republicans in
general been called hitler
is anybody apologizing for that
is anybody asking them to apologize no
because it's the standard for talking
about public figures if bobert or
anybody else wants to call any member of
congress a terrorist
no matter what
because their ethnicity because that's
why trump is called hitler right that's
why republicans are called hitler it's
because of their ethnicity
if they were not white and male
a lot less hitler calling don't you
think
there'd probably be some
but to be a lot less of it and to
pretend that calling somebody hitler is
unrelated to their ethnicity
is a little disingenuous right because
we don't you know call the black leaders
hitler
i mean sometimes but it's you know
that'd be the exception
um so i don't think that uh uh
bobert did i call her robert i don't
think bobert should have apologized
i don't think it's a big deal that she
did either either way
but
as long as calling trump hitler is okay
we can call omar a terrorist because
she's a
political figure and she has said things
that would make ordinary people suggest
she has some
uh let's say not enough uh
not enough disavowing of the terrorists
let's say
yeah it's a reasonable opinion you could
debate it but it's it's in the
reasonable zone
but here's my take on it just to get you
all mad
i don't see much difference between the
far left and the far right
i think both of them are racist
ideologies and i think
they're not practical ideologies
now
i would go further and say that
everybody on the far left has a
far-right
doppelganger
who's just sort of like the same thing
but is racist against different groups
right so they're not identical
they're similarly racist and similarly
impractical
so you could do your you could play this
game at home
but i think bober is just aoc with a gun
that's all i see
now i'm pro
aoc
as a
as an influencer as a persuasive person
as a powerful entity in the country she
does have the whole package
bober has a pretty good package too
right her
let's say the marketing of herself is
pretty strong they're both pretty uh
persuasive in their different ways
but yeah everybody's gonna say it's a
bad comparison
i'm aware of that right i'm aware that
you don't like this
but i'm giving you my opinion
or you you can't really argue with an
opinion
it's subjective
so if you say hey in my opinion they're
completely different i'm not even going
to argue with you i'd say okay
that would be how you see it
and that's perfectly acceptable
but i'm telling you how i see it
you can you can't argue it it's just
it's literally a subjective
opinion that they're basically the same
person
you know um beau bird sounds you know
like she's tough on immigrants which
some people will interpret as racist
aoc says she's tough on white people
which reasonable people
feel is racist
it's the same person
to me
and in some ways elon omar is just
steve king but with better headwear
by the way
if i if i may give a compliment
to elon omar
um
because you know i'm generally a critic
and i i always advise you that if you
can't give a compliment
to somebody on the other team
you know maybe you're not as unbiased as
you'd like to be here's my compliment to
elon omar
i really like her style
like you're actually fashion style
you know she's always within the
or i don't know if she's always but
within the sort of islamic
western eyes look she's really good
at fashion anyway
um
so i don't see much difference between
the far left and the far right and i and
i think that we're being hypnotized into
imagining that we should be siding with
either of them
um
a daily beast columnist
named wajahat ali
he tweeted that
nothing the squad has said or done is
remotely as extreme or radical as
bobert gosar
marjorie taylor green and trump to which
i say
what
are you kidding me
you don't think
that
they've been uh as extreme or as radical
on the far left
what news are you watching
how could you possibly think that now
again
he's expressing an opinion and it's
subjective so i can't say it's wrong
because it's subjective
but it sure looks the same to me
i mean they look about equally extreme
or radical but just in completely
different ways
anyway
here's my favorite story of the day
uh if you don't follow tennis you've
never heard of this uh gentleman but
nick uh kyrgios
here
i might be pronouncing right wrong here
kyrgios
he's a young male tennis star he has
been in the top 20 but he's struggling a
little bit and part of the reason is
that he's struggling is that he's uh
he claims he's too horny to play tennis
no seriously
seriously he said he was too horny to
play tennis because apparently he goes
on the road and then he's away from his
his girlfriend or wife or whatever it is
for months at a time
and uh you know allegedly is not
cheating on her apparently and uh he he
said it out loud this is not even my
interpretation
he basically said it's really it's
getting more difficult to play i was
going to say hard but then you were
going to make bad jokes
it's getting difficult to play because
he's too horny
now
i'm
really in favor of this excuse
because
most excuses you've heard so many times
and you're like oh yeah traffic was bad
that's why you were late right the
traffic was bad
not because you started out late and
everybody knew the traffic was bad but
because the traffic was bad
right do i have chocolate
damn it
i always have chocolate in the edge of
my mouth i do these things
but the reason i'm so happy about this
story is that i plan to use this for a
lot of different excuses
for example if i fail to meet my comic
deadline for dilbert
and my editor calls me and says you know
you missed deadline
i'm going to say i know i missed the
deadline but in my defense
i was way too horny to draw a comic
way too horny
and i think that has to mean something
all right so let's all uh let's
normalize that excuse i like that one
so there's a poll uh i saw on i guess
fox news
uh was reporting on a poll that said
kamal harris is the top choice for
democrats if biden doesn't run again
top choice
the the lowest approval
in history for for a vice president
top choice
oh but but wait
i don't want you to think that the
democrats don't have a deep bench
because here are the other people who
did who also
did well and by the way the top choice
only gives 13 support on their own team
13
top choice
here are the ones that are not the top
choice
uh bernie sanders who will be i believe
273
years old when the election happens
elizabeth warren
corey booker
michael bloomberg
andrew yang and uh pete butterjudge
also were named
so so that's their bench
now of this group
i would say that uh you know michael
bloomberg
at least looks like you know a serious
person
but he's how old is bloomberg now isn't
he like 107 or something
that's it
give me an age on michael bloomberg
somebody google that quickly
is he 80.
he's a 69 he's not 69
he's got to be older than 69
isn't he
all right well somebody will have that
number in a moment 79 i'm seeing i don't
know
he's too old so anyway the democrats
have absolutely no bench
how in the world is anybody going to
keep trump from being president again
like what would have to happen
there's no way he's going to be beaten
straight up
am i right
so we're seeing bloomberg at 79 almost
80.
um
this is the weakest bench i've i've seen
in a long time pretty weak
because the people on here are proven
losers
or too old
yeah now now look at the republican side
imagine
desantis
strong choice imagine tom cotton
strong choice rand paul
serious choice
trump of course
i mean i feel like you could go down the
line and you could find you know a
reasonable number of uh republicans who
have a shot at it
yeah christy gnome
oh you know
newsome is interesting because he was
not on the list
see you know we're all critics of not
all of us but many of us here are
critics of governor newsom including
myself
but he's a really good politician
you know he's got the look and the play
so if if he got serious about running
for president i think he could make a
dent actually
um
let's talk about china
so my favorite nba player of all time so
far is n.s cantor
who has been dumping on china like crazy
and now he's going after the olympics
yay
and s
uh he says quote shame on organizations
like the international olympic committee
the setting up an olympic games this
coming winter in china so he's going
right after the olympics and china is
kind of weak there because
of the tennis star disappearance
so their top tennis star
has semi disappeared obviously is under
something like a house arrest for
speaking out against uh chinese
leadership
uh specifically
talking about getting raped by a member
of leadership
so and s i am backing you 100 and i
don't think we should uh attend the
olympics
in china or anybody else should we will
probably but i don't think we should in
other good uh anti-china news uh
tele china telecom americas which is a
telecom
services provider in the u.s
is being uh blocked so
the fcc is kicking them out
so they won't be able to do business in
the united states anymore
because they have ties to china and they
lied about where their data was being
kept and
they have
ties to the chinese government
specifically
so they were considered not uh
trustworthy
now when i heard that
america was going to start to dump on
huawei you know the big chinese telecom
company
i immediately bought shares in their
competitor um
erickson
and those erickson shares went down i
think 16
in like just a few weeks
now why is erickson stock going down
when huawei i think its biggest
competitor
should be almost you know
approaching extinct in a lot of markets
what exactly is happening i don't give
i don't give
investment advice and if you were to
take any based on this conversation it
would be a big mistake
but i don't see why the competition
could possibly be down
when their biggest competitor is
sort of in big trouble
anyway
i'm watching that there's something i
don't know about that market that's
happening right now
probably a lot
but seeing the united states shutting
down chinese businesses here
is good stuff but that's not all that's
happening
so i saw a tweet by dan harris he has
some international
experience that makes him look qualified
to say this so there's an article
talking about how
there's a commission that's looking at
shutting down investment from the united
states in chinese government
government-connected businesses
but it looks like
maybe
so this is what dan says he says within
a year at most the us will have shut
down nearly all investment money flowing
to china
is that real
now i'm talking about people investing
in their stock market to prop it up i'm
not talking about uh companies moving in
with production facilities
i don't know about that
i don't know if that's slowing down or
stopped and i'd love to see some news on
that can you tell me why there's no news
on what companies in the united states
have recently decided to do new business
in china
as in manufacturing plants
why is that not reported
maybe the single most important thing we
should know
am i wrong
is there anything more important in the
world
than knowing how many americans are
still moving into china versus whether
or not it stopped
i can't think of anything because even
climate change is going to take a while
but
but the china problem is a little bit
more immediate
all right
so that's happening
and
um the jerusalem post
is reporting that
apparently the
there have been some
math done at the peking university
about what would happen if china opened
up to travel because china is still
locked down for travel
if china opens up for travel
apparently it will be a pandemic
disaster in china
according to some modelers
so they can't open up for travel
maybe ever
what are they going to do
so china's in a world of hurt
so they're losing you know their ability
to compete in any company that has a
government connection in china they're
losing their investment from at least
the united states in their stock market
and they can't open up their country but
probably
countries will be able to open up
so how do you bring new business to
china if you're going to build a
manufacturing plant in china
you know that you would have to visit it
a lot right if you were going to do it
right let's say apple wanted to open a
new or do new business with somebody in
china
they would put an american apple
employee like right on scene
checking stuff out
if you can't travel i don't know if you
can do new business there if there's any
physical part of that business
because you have to see it
to believe it
so
um here's a little uh difference of
experts
so
um
this omicron
variant
do we know if it's more dangerous or
less dangerous yet
we're thinking it's more
virulent or it spreads faster than the
normal ones
but we know we don't know if it's more
dangerous yet right
because we're seeing some indication and
i would say these would be preliminary
reports that it's way less dangerous
than the existing you know big ones
but then i saw this comment from dr eli
david um
he was quoting the chair of the south
african medical association who said
about the omicron uh
variant that it may be highly
transmissible but so far the cases we're
seeing are extremely mild
extremely mild
um
and then dr david says this makes a lot
of sense
because less virulent mutations have
greater evolutionary advantage
makes sense
and this is exactly how the spanish flu
ended he says
wait do we know that
i thought it was still a mystery how the
spanish flu ended
but do we is this a true statement
that we know how the spanish flu ended
and it was because
a variant was more
transmissible but weaker so it basically
was like a
vaccination
how many of you remember
a long time ago
that i was wondering why we don't make a
variant of our own that's highly
transmissible but gives you extremely
mild symptoms so everybody would just
get vaccinated sort of naturally just by
hanging around
and it turns out that
maybe that's a thing
but you have to wait for it as opposed
to engineering it
right the tech didn't exist to test the
spanish flu exactly
so we wouldn't really know what happened
with the spanish flu would we or do we
just assume that's the only way it could
have stopped
because i don't think the spanish flu
ever reached um
herd immunity did it
i don't think it did
it just stopped and we don't know why
right
oh the dark horse podcast went over this
did darkhorse conclude that the variance
the weaker variants were the reason that
the
the
the dangerous variant died out
all right so i'm going to say that
that's still a mystery to me
and then michael amina
gave us a reminder here said it is not
inevitable that the viruses mutate
toward becoming
less pathogenic and virulent
and he says the idea that viruses
inevitably become more infectious but
but less you know transmissible has
manipulating but should really be put to
rest so apparently your virus can go in
either direction
but wouldn't it be reasonable to assume
it goes in both
at the same time
wouldn't a
wouldn't you see
for any massive pandemic
wouldn't you see the virus
having some
variants that are worse and some that
are better
better meaning it transmits but it
doesn't make you sick
very sick
so i'm a little confused about what is
and isn't happening here with these
variants but um i'm tentatively going to
be of the opinion
that there's no other explanation for
any pandemic ends
i feel like the weak
the weak variant
hypothesis has to be the only way they
end right
i can't think of another way
so i would think that if you wait long
enough you inevitably get worse ones
inevitably
but inevitably you would get ones that
would inoculate you forever
at this also
right
herd immunity is the end of the virus
scott
well you're acting and then lol what's
it what's the lol for
because you imagined i said something i
didn't and then you dunked on me in your
imagination
and then you really ha lol
good job
hallucinating and then dunking on your
hallucination
um
dr jews been saying this from the
beginning
all right
um
so i saw an andy no video montage he
didn't make it but he tweeted it
of all the democratic leaders saying
that the vaccine was dangerous because
it was a trump vaccine in the early days
now
how much trouble has the fake news
and the democrats caused by lying about
 i mean how many people have died
because of fake news it's not zero
fake news is killing people
in a variety of ways
all right
um
here's uh
i think that's a here's what i would
call true but fake news you ready
this is now my opinion so the next stuff
i say you need lots of fact checks on
this because it's pretty preliminary
but you have your dr malone a lot of you
have heard of uh he's getting a lot of
attention on the internet
and
i believe his take is that the vaccines
would cause selection pressure
and cause more variants that could be
dangerous
how many of you uh believe that's the
case the vaccinations
uh create selection pressure because if
something gets out
then
you know that's really a super bug if it
got out past the vaccines
seeing a lot of yeses yes yes yes
so would you say that it's true
that vaccinations create an extra danger
of
variance
true or false give me a yes or no in
your opinion
do vaccinations
make the odds of a dangerous variant
worse
yes or no
see lots of yeses but lots of no's
how could we be
how could we be disagreeing on such a
basic question
by now
right now a lot of you are saying hey
stop talking about the pandemic i'm not
really talking about the pandemic
anymore i'm kind of talking about how
we're processing information that's the
interesting part to me
but look how many people are on
different sides of this very basic
question
does a vaccination cause
variants
to become more dangerous
all right
here's why this is fake news this real
news in my opinion
so i need i need some help on this one
but here's my take
it's true the vaccinations make variants
um add selection press
pressure meaning that anything that gets
down past the vaccination
may have a little extra characteristics
that would be dangerous
so i think that's true
but here's why it's fake and true at the
same time
here's the twist
because if you had no vaccinations what
would happen
more virus right
everybody agree with that basic
statement if there are more vaccinations
there are fewer virus
because fewer people have it for you
know a long period of time you can still
get it
but you get it less often and you don't
carry it as long
so you'd all agree that vaccinations
greatly reduce the amount of total virus
in the world compared to no vaccinations
all right does anybody disagree with
that
so if you're disagreeing with that
you're just you're just lost
yeah the there's one thing that i don't
think any experts disagree on
the vaccinations reduce the total amount
of virus in the world
now
here are two things that are true
getting the vaccination might create
some selection pressure
true not having any vaccinate
vaccinations at all
would also create more virus which would
create more variants
which one is the bigger effect
the all the very the virus in the world
you know raging out of control
and all of the variants that that would
create because the more varia the more
virus the more variance
that much science knows
the more virus the more variance that's
pretty much direct right direct
causation
and
so you have two effects
one is the vaccination might make the
chances of you specifically
creating a variant a little bit higher
but if you nobody's vaccinated the the
total risk
of variance is just off the chart
so it's true that vaccinations can
create that pressure but it's also true
that if you didn't get vaccinated it
would be way worse with the variance
that i believe is the current scientific
opinion
so if you see said dr malone say
that vaccinations could cause selection
pressure and variance
that would be true
but doesn't
doesn't answer the question
somebody says on the other hand wouldn't
we reach herd immunity faster yes we
would
yes we would but with what level of
death and damage
all right shoplifting is out of control
in san francisco you may have heard
more stores are going down some
security guard has been killed now
defending one of them
and
the san francisco
chronicle runs a story where the
headline at least the tweet was
we explore what police data especially
numbers from one particular corner in
the city can and can't tell us about
what is happening
seriously
the san francisco chronicle
is wondering why the looting is
happening
like what's the cause of it
seriously
is there anybody who doesn't know the
cause of it
the cause is that the penalties were
taken away
and it became a good business model
it didn't used to be a good business
model to steal stuff because you'd get
caught you'd be prosecuted
but now you won't get caught you don't
get prosecuted or the the odds are so
low that now it's just an obvious good
thing to do you need you really need a
newspaper to do research on this
i'm pretty sure we know what's going on
there
so the democrats have literally
destroyed retail commerce
and won't admit it
they've destroyed retail i think forever
and won't admit it
how in the world can a democrat ever get
elected president again
how in the world
i don't see any way a democrat could
could win the presidency in this context
it seems impossible i mean trump would
have to
declare war on switzerland or something
wouldn't he i mean what would he have to
do to lose this election if he runs
i'm not convinced he's going to run but
if he does
all right
so here's a comment i see a lot so shane
hazel said this today he tweeted
remember when the the vaxxed
people weren't going to need beds
so basically uh
harkening back to the fact that we were
told the vaccinations would be real
vaccinations and blah blah blah
and
that way of thinking is so broken
because you know what we can't go back
it's already done it's history can't
change it
and and what we knew when we started is
very different from what we know now
in the fog of war you're supposed to
make
mistakes
so if in the fog of war the government
made mistakes and they made lots of them
that doesn't mean anything
it doesn't mean anything because of
course they were going to make mistakes
in the beginning
it doesn't mean the next one's a mistake
it does mean you should be very
skeptical about your government but
we're already there
rich says i keep moving the goal post
all right so let me talk to rich who is
obviously a idiot
so rich
am i moving the gold posts or did we
learn new information rich
rich
if you don't change your opinion when
the information changes you're a
goddamn
okay
and if you thought that during the fog
of war people were going to make good
decisions well you're a idiot
because nobody no matter how smart
no matter how much they're like you rich
they can't make good decisions without
data
and we didn't have data
we were guessing
some of those guesses are going to be
wrong do you know what that tells you
about the next decision
 nothing
nothing
so grow up learn that the past is gone
it doesn't tell you anything about the
future
analogies are not thinking you're gonna
have to look at every situation
individually and yes we all
understand that we don't trust the
government about everything and every
decision and sometimes they make
mistakes
and sometimes it's about money blah blah
blah blah so telling us that they got
one wrong doesn't tell us any
useful thing
and it bores me
all right
so
moving the goal posts scott you're
moving the goal posts you thought the
vaccines were going to work well first
of all
probably one of the few people who said
publicly that i didn't think the
vaccines were going to work
fact check me
i said i said that the experts say
that they've been trying for decades to
make a coronavirus vaccination
it hasn't worked for decades
the expert said it won't work this time
i said well looks like it's not going to
work but i think our therapeutics will
probably be pretty good
right
that was my prediction so my prediction
was that vaccines wouldn't necessarily
work but therapeutics would save us
did i move the guy
goal posts rich
no
i was right is what i was
now if i'd been wrong i would have been
like everybody else because we didn't
have data
um
chad asks uh
why are we not doing wide scale serology
to i assume you're you're asking to see
how much
uh immunity we have i'll bet those
studies are going on
um has anybody seen a study on wide
wide scales urology just to see if
people already have antibodies
i assume that's going on right
um
yeah matt that was worth five dollars
for the chuckle
um
how many times have been they've been
wrong
the government
if you're trying to get me to admit that
the government sometimes makes mistakes
or even
shut up
just shut up
nobody needs to know that we all know
that
let me let me tell you how another way
to spot an npc
if they're arguing something that a
hundred percent of the world knows
all right here's here's an npc thing
but scott
the vaccinations don't stop
don't stop the the flu
or the virus completely
right
everybody knows that
you don't really need to tell us that
again
a micro lesson on how to handle trolls
well don't do it the way i do it i'm not
sure i'm the one who can give you the
lesson on that
because you know remember if you're an
energy monster
you you look for conflict
because it gives you energy and i'm a
bit of an energy monster too so when i
uh when i go after a troll it's part of
my business model
if you go after a troll it's probably
just a bad day
so i'm not sure you should bother maybe
you should ignore them and leave that to
the people who
have a business model where mocking
trolls is actually part of the
entertainment
um
energy vampire
have you watched
let me give you some
tv show recommendations
uh curb your enthusiasm is back for
another season
and oh my god it's good
oh my god it's good
it's just so good
um
the other is uh
uh what we do in the shadows
just incredibly funny i think it's it's
off now but you can you can see it see
the ones that have run
um i i hope it's coming back i don't i
don't think it's canceled it's a
terrific show and then there's another
one called uh
wellington paranormal have you ever
heard of it
wellington
paranormal it's actually great
[Laughter]
it's about a two cops in new zealand
who are put on the supernatural task
force but nobody gets to know
and they're both
and one of them is one of them is a dumb
guy
he does the best dumb guy
you know you're used to seeing somebody
play the dumb guy on on movies and stuff
but he does the best dumb guy since dumb
and dumber i mean he's a really good
dumb guy
he's brilliant
um
yeah ted lasso i think maybe
i i didn't finish watching it sort of
slowed down i might get back to it i
don't know
so that's good and uh do you want to if
you want a guilty pleasure
i'm embarrassed that i
i'm even gonna recommend this but if you
want one that's like pure empty calories
uh but entertaining
uh what's it called the
sex life of college girls or something
is it on
i forget which streaming service it's on
but it is
purely for your worst
instincts but the but the show they keep
kind of lively you know so i like
fast-paced shows where nobody is tied to
a chair and uh tortured
by the way that's that's my turn off the
movie point if i watch any movie
the moment somebody's tied to a chair
boop turn it off
because because that tells me the
writers are bad
if you have to tie somebody to a chair
in your movie you're a bad bad writer
sorry
all right
that's about all i've got for today and
i think that's plenty don't you
let's see if we can talk less about the
uh
pandemic in the future
i mean i'd really like to but i feel i
feel as if all the
the psychological
phenomenon is sort of happening in that
domain
so the stuff that i'm interested in is
way less about the science
and way less about the you know the
politics i'm just fascinated by how
we're processing the information
because you saw that you know rich the
troll here
you see how some people process
information it's just shocking
please stop talking about it
uh john i'm not gonna do that
i'm not gonna do that
it is the biggest thing in the world and
the thing that i find most interesting
from the psychology of it the those of
you who want it to go away by not
talking about it well good luck with
that that's not going to happen so i
mean you can have that dream but
you know it's it's a useless dream
um and i also think these are the
biggest decisions we need to make now i
would like to give you this
following reframes
um
and i've said this often but the more i
say it the more useful it is i think
the citizens run this country
we only delegate
when we can't decide
so if the citizens you know are sort of
close to split or even 60 40 that's
pretty close to a split we say you know
it'd be better off if we just let the
politicians work this one out we're kind
of happy with that
but that doesn't change the fact that
the citizens are completely in control
it's only when the citizens don't have
an opinion it's a split opinion
that's the only time the government has
control
so if you're worried about the pandemic
lasting forever
which citizens want that
which ones
there are no citizens that want the
pandemic to last forever
the citizens will end the pandemic when
there are enough of them that want it
ended
now of course it is you know
brainwashing the citizens and that's
part of the problem but i feel at this
point
[Music]
you know we'll be able to directly
observe
you know is it getting worse or is it
getting better do you know people who
are sick you know so i feel like
the public went from completely helpless
it's getting more and more informed
taking a little bit more control
and as soon as it reaches i don't know
what the ratio is 75 on the same team
you know if we reach a point where 75
percent of any place
says get rid of the masks
do you think the government could keep
you masked if 75 percent of the
republicans said no i don't
so imagining that the government has
control over these decisions is a little
bit
misleading
misleading
if you could get your fellow citizens
and whenever i say that it sounds sexist
doesn't it your fellow citizens
um
if you can get them to change their mind
then the government will change its mind
it really isn't up to the government
do you think that california or the
governor newsom is acting the way he is
you know tighter in california than
other places do you think he's doing
that because the
without support of the public
he's not the reason california is
different than florida is that our
public is different not because the
government's different it's the public
so every time you feel helpless
you're not helpless because of the
government
at least on this issue
you're helpless because your fellow
citizens have different opinions
and if you can change their opinions
and you have the ability to do that with
social media
go ahead
go do it
they can take your money scott in all
caps was that
supposed to mean something
they can take your money oh you mean the
government can take your money in terms
of taxes yes
yes but do you know do you know why the
government can take your money even at a
gun
point in terms of taxes
because the citizens are okay with it
as soon as the citizens don't want it it
goes away
but there are enough people who want it
that
we delegate to the government
so and i don't think this is necessarily
like other countries
australia for example
i feel like the government might be in
control there you know what i mean it
looks like the government is in control
but
if the united states said you all have
to stay home
for i don't know a month you can't go
outdoors
well that would be the end of it
that would be the end of the pandemic
because you certainly get more than 70
percent of americans to say uh no
no we're going outdoors
yeah yeah we're done with your rules now
we're just going outdoors
so
i i i think that it uh
well
i'm not worried about the boiling frog
syndrome i see that in the comments
meaning that they'll slowly condition us
to
do more and more
because the problem is there's nobody
who wants it
you need somebody
who's on the side of wanting the public
to be locked down
and wear masks
there's nobody in the government who
wants that
they don't want it for its own purpose
i think that's ridiculous
um
florida baby
yeah the public in florida is different
so they
their government acts differently of
course
but it's not the government it's the
people
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
uh
take my money you said that we can deal
with the age that might be later at
least we can find happiness in china's
poor and uh
okay well i don't know that was worth
five dollars but
thank you anyway i'll talk to
