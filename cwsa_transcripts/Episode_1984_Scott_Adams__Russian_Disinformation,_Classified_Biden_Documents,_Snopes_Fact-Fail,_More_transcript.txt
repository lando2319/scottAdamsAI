for you Erica the excellent
[Music]
good morning everybody
and if I've done my job correctly
I am now streaming on locals and maybe
Rumble
and maybe YouTube
and if you rumble or see me yet
well uh I think I've got a check for the
comments over on Rumble
but apparently I don't know how to do
that so I've got a separate page open
for you Rumble comments
but it's looking like I won't know how
to find them
yeah
see I I can't check for them until I'm
live
and then when I am live I don't know
where to look for them
no idea so if you want to comment uh
Rumblers I won't see you today yeah
maybe I'll fix that next time
I think I've got my camera lined up I
think it's all working today how would
you like to take it up to a level that
you've never seen before
you would and all you need for that is a
copper bug or a glass to take your
Chelsea style and the canteen and jug of
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip it
happens now go
thank you for noticing yes this is a
very nice shirt I'm wearing today
quite a bit better than all the other
shirts I've been ever wearing before I
think it looks good
all right
uh how many of you uh were worried about
me yesterday because it uh the the
internet seems to think I was having a
meltdown
I I was contacted by some people who
care
to say are you okay
everything okay
and how how many other people were
having the same
same experience
did anybody see me interacting on
Twitter
and say something wrong here
all right no there was something going
on
so if you thought it was a meltdown
uh that wasn't exactly exactly what was
happening but it looked like it
so let me let me tell you what was
really happening behind the scenes
every year
a few times a year several times a year
maybe
if I'm locking you four times a year
I enter a manic phase
do you know what that is manic
and what I manic
um everything is more
right so that's the context so for the
last few days I've been in a manic phase
they are amazing
like you know I suppose it's mental
illness right but I don't experience it
that way it becomes a problem for other
people
in other words I become a little bit too
much
because in the manic phase I have
Infinite Energy
I don't seem to need sleep like
literally uh I think I had two hours of
sleep the night before
went all day
had you know great workout uh I did more
work
in the last 48 hours more comics more
writing got more chores done did
paperwork I've been putting off forever
I mean I was just cranking through it
but what but one of the uh side effects
is that on Twitter
by now you know my pattern if somebody
starts a damaging false rumor about me
I I usually go nuclear on it until I can
draw more attention to the correction
than the original claim so what I'm
trying to do is you know light all the
kindling I can get everybody as mad as
possible provoke everybody draw as much
energy toward me and so yesterday I was
just responding to every troll
and you know I was swearing at him and
but I was just having fun
and I can see how from the outside it
would look like I was having a meltdown
but let me tell you if you were to look
at the quality of my day let's say last
day and a half
exceptional
like the the last day of the half has
been some of my like just most enjoyable
productive incredibly creative like you
know I was creating you know micro
lesson three Comics one day I mean I was
just cranking it out it was all pretty
good
now fortunately
you know you you've heard of people have
manic what's the other thing
the manic part feels good but then the
manic
depressive depression I don't really get
the depression part
you know I I certainly have days
where like I'll have a week where I'm
down but not really the kind where you
can't get out of bed you know no nothing
like a clinical depression you know you
just have days that you're not ideal
so if you had a choice of having like
four weeks during the year where you're
a little down
but the trade-off of that is four weeks
of uh Mania
you would take the Mania it's a really
good trade-off in mental health you know
now let me be really clear
my situation seems to be completely
different
than most people who are having some
kind of mental you know let's say mental
what'd I say
uh variability let's call it variability
because the difference between the highs
and the lows generally when you've got
that much variability there's you're not
too happy about it
but I think in my case it just makes
other people unhappy
but you also feel invulnerable
like nothing gets to you so people
people were worried that I was you know
down yesterday and the whole day I was
thinking down
I don't think I've had a finer day and
and months it was a really good day
yeah usually you get extreme lows that's
right so if anybody else tells you they
have Mania you should be feeling
probably some sympathy
but not my case
yeah
so he says I was no I was I was
trying to be as mean as I could to
everybody
because that's by the way the next time
there's the next time there's
you know any major rumor about me that's
untrue
I'm going to do the same thing whether
I'm in Mania or not I'm going to spend
the whole day responding to as many
trolls as possible
correcting the record
and I'll be as mean as possible so that
they'll retweet it and say what's wrong
with this guy
that's all right that's why how I get
the energy all right
um I've discovered that I have
bifurcated into two complete people in
the mind of the public
which is which is kind of fun and weird
so I always talk about the two movies on
one screen right we're all watching the
same screen but some people are saying
the the union is ending and other people
are seeing the Golden Age and we don't
agree on anything
but I think I finally realized
um why the Twitter users and the live
stream users have completely different
impressions of me
so I live stream
I have enough time to do the uh
full context
so on live stream if I say you know I'm
on the same side as this argument but I
but I think the argument that's on my
side is a little weak
so I want you to know I'm on the same
side but I'd like to see a stronger
argument on my side
so that's what I would say a live stream
on Twitter I would just say what's wrong
with the argument
and then then I turn into the opposite
person so on so on locals YouTube and
Rumble I'm you know Scott Adams the
reasonable uh the reasonable voice that
looks at all sides and tries to consider
them fairly
and on Twitter I'm
Claude Adams the the guy who's
indistinguishable from Dr fauci
that's what uh idiot attorney Barnes
tweeted the other day or yesterday he
tweeted that that I was basically fouchy
foreign
now in the other movie
in the other movie people know that I'm
the first person the first public figure
to call fauci a liar in public
I'm the first one and I never changed my
mind once he lied in public I was like
oh he's a he's a guy who lies in public
so that was the last time I trusted him
for anything
so it's like a whole different you know
claw claw Adams apparently trusts him
but live stream Adams Scott Adams never
trusted him from the first time he
opened his mouth
yeah I'm not sure that Robert Barnes has
an opinion
wouldn't that just be uh uninformed
flailing
is it really an opinion if it's based on
obviously wrong data
I guess it's still depending it's just
an uninformed opinion all right I would
like to tell you the weirdest thing that
happened to me yesterday I told you
yesterday was an awesome day
for me
this was the coolest thing that happened
back at around 20 we'll say 2000
five or six
some of you know my life story enough to
know that I lost my ability to speak
so there's a rare disorder called a
spasmodic dysphonia
and I lost the ability to speak for
about three and a half years I can make
noise but my vocal cords were clenching
so that you couldn't understand what I
was saying
so for those three and a half years I
used affirmations
and the affirmation that I did when I
was driving I would do it out loud but
it didn't sound like real real talk
I don't know what it sounded like but my
mouth was moving and my brain was
thinking of the words but I don't know
what was coming up
but what I was thinking was this
I Scott Adams will speak perfectly yeah
you remember
will speak perfectly now
is there anything wrong with that
affirmation
yes
it's literally impossible by definition
nobody can speak perfectly
that that no human being can do that so
I literally had an affirmation
which was not just a little bit
impossible
but actually completely impossible and I
think you would agree that although my
career voice has a you know it's good
enough for a commercial application
which is what I'm doing now
so it's good enough for commercial use
but I'm still nasally and you know I
still clear my throat and you know I'm
blowing my nose on camera and every
other damn thing so I'm nowhere near
nowhere near uh
perfect voice
and then yesterday
quiet
and then yesterday
something happened
and I tweeted it around now I think this
is a real story
I'm not sure but I think it's a real
story
as you know I've offered my
personality and appearance and voice to
anybody who wants to make an AI product
you know a deep fake so anybody wants to
use my personality
uh for AI I've I've allowed a full
public license with no restrictions
so anything you want to do
yesterday there was an announcement by
an AI company
that they decided to use my voice as the
main voice of their AI products
and the reason they did it is because
they'd looked around at all the voices
they could use and they decided that my
voice was pleasing enough
and persuasive enough and they use
persuasion specifically they thought my
voice had a persuasive quality to it
and they're going to build it into their
products now here's the fun part
it won't be a recording of my voice
right the AI will do an impression of my
voice and it will do a really good one
because it has lots of samples to pull
from
and when the AI does an impression of my
voice
is going to
remove
all
imperfections
there's actually a really good chance
that my voice will become perfect
and become you know I don't think it's
going to be as big as Siri or you know
Alexa
but my voice actually might get
Incorporated in AI
and it might be perfect
because they would fix it to be so now
I've actually if you've listened to any
of my audiobooks that I recorded after I
had the voice problem
you might say to yourself well Scott you
did a whole audiobook
and they sounded pretty close to perfect
to me I didn't hear anything wrong at
all the entire book but what you don't
know is that it's very
uh I don't want to say very imperfect
sorry Joshua
but my voice is imperfect
in reality but the audio Engineers take
out all the imperfections
so you get to hear it perfect
even though it wasn't
so of all the unlikely things in the
world
2004 I tested the concept of
affirmations with something I literally
thought was impossible because remember
at the time it was an incurable
condition
it was incurable
had always been incurable
nobody had ever been cured now turns out
a few people had been and I didn't know
about it through a a surgery that only
one person was doing and it was still
experimental and that's what cured me
but I actually used affirmations to
accomplish the literal impossibility
literally impossible and it just
happened where it looks like it's
happening
is that crazy
is it just blowing my mind because it's
about me
or is that actually mind-blowing
because you know I'm I'm fairly well
known for talking about affirmations
being a big part of my story
but that one that one was always the one
that got away
that was always the one that got away
and I've always wondered about it I
thought you know maybe I just imagined
this whole affirmation thing being
useful
I don't know it's so strange it's like
well
let's talk more about Snopes yesterday I
told you that Snopes I wasn't covering
the fine people hoax and if they had it
would have changed history because if
they'd called it a hoax the left would
have believed it presumably and then
Biden would not be able to run on it and
everything could have been different
but
um
I did if I I find out that instead of
the fine people hoax which they did seem
to ignore they instead fact checked
whether Trump was quote refusing to
condemn white supremacy
so that was the angle they took on it so
they took the the larger view that
included the
the debates
so they used the debates
as the point of focus to take it away
from the fact that he immediately
condemned the neo-nazis in
Charlottesville without prompting he
immediately in his own way immediately
said as soon as he said fine people a
few sentences later he said I'm not
talking about the neo-nazis so that was
the hoax that he was but when he wasn't
so
Snopes does this whole thing and they
they say
they actually they actually said
that whether or not this was true or
false that Trump had quote refused to
give them white supremacy
depends on your definition of refused
do I have to say anything else
it was like it's the Bill Clinton
defense well it depends on your
definition of it they actually use the
Bill Clinton
approach and I'm not going to read you
everything they said because if you
start off with it depends how you define
and refused
you know exactly what you're getting
right
and the argument has something to do
with when they asked them to do it
during the debate
he said sure
and then they said well would you be
willing to condemn them he said yes
well would you condemn them sure
does that sound like refusing
and here's the refusing part then
apparently I think Biden and maybe the
moderator or Mike Wallace were both
saying well then go ahead and do it go
ahead and do it
and then he said tell me who
specifically you want me to condemn
is that is that a fair question
tell me specifically who you're asking
me to condemn that's a fair question
right because I'm sure he didn't want to
defend I'm sure he didn't want to like
condemn the right wing of the Republican
Party
right because maybe they would have said
that well well I think all the
right-wing Republicans are racist so
condemn them
don't you think you have to ask
specifically what do you want me to
condemn I think so
now they said the proud boys if you
remember the debate that was the one all
right about the proud boys condemn them
I think somebody else they mentioned and
he said proud boys you know Stand By and
something like that
now why did he not immediately condemn
the proud boys
there's an obvious reason isn't there I
mean besides the fact that they
supported him the obvious reason is I
don't think anybody knew exactly what
the proud boys were up to
because I didn't
you know I a few years before well no
one was it
yeah a few years before that
I did a podcast interview I was invited
by Gavin McGinnis founder of The Proud
boys who's no longer Affiliated but the
founder of The Proud boys asked me to do
an interview
and I didn't know anything about them
that sounded negative at the time at the
time so I spent I don't know 45 minutes
for an hour talking to him and it was
just perfectly fine conversation that
was it
now
do you think that Trump was like in the
details of knowing if the proud boys had
any bad elements or if they'd ever said
anything he needed to condemn how can he
possibly know that
it would be ridiculous to imagine he had
that level of knowledge about that group
at that time now since then
you know they were involved in the
January 6 Etc we we've learned more
about them maybe maybe some individuals
there did some bad things that you could
point out
but at the time
it was a perfectly good question which
is who do you want me to condemn
and secondly
maybe he takes a pass of The Proud boys
because they support him and he doesn't
know what they did wrong
specifically
yeah so uh yeah snopes is uh
completely uh reprehensible for the way
they handle this
uh Bruce Fenton on Twitter
he asked chat GPT the AI
uh what I thought of the uh fine people
hoax and its first take was
not not debunking it
but then uh he was the the AI was pushed
and when pushed it sort of admitted it
was a lie
so the AI acted a little bit like a
human
it avoided the question when asked
directly
and then when asked directly I was like
well yeah
now I think each version of chat GPT
acts a little differently so you it's
way too early to imagine that you're
seeing a trend yet there's no Trend but
it's you know it's achieving
Consciousness and the problem is the AI
might be as biased as we are how can it
avoid it
let me ask you this directly how is it
possible
Chinese room what's that mean
how would it be possible for AI to not
be biased
right if AI mimics humans and humans are
biased by
let's say what what they want to be true
you know they want the new news to be
compatible with what they already know
is true AI is going to do the same thing
if AI has a framework of what is true
and then you presented some new
headlines it will take those headlines
and try to figure out how it fits with
what it already knows
so it should be as biased as people
so we're going to have a super
intelligence
that is super biased
what the hell is that going to do to us
that could be our biggest risk we talk
about the singularity and you know all
the unknowns and replacing human people
for their jobs and it could be that AI
is just biased
and that bias we imagine is intelligence
and it's not it's just bias
so that's problem
all right uh you are you following the
story of uh some classified documents
from the Biden Administration turned up
in some left-leading uh Think Tank
and
this is just a payback story right
this isn't a real story
I mean I'm sure yeah well I'm not sure
the facts might be real
it's a Chinese Think Tank
is it because
I didn't see that in reporting
the story I read about it didn't have
anything about that
all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna call BS
on that
somebody says China funded
all right I'm not going to claim that as
a fact
because I'm just reading in comments but
I I would encourage you to read the
story and see if there's anything behind
it
um here's what I think I think this is
just a payback story
meaning that it's going to be just like
the Trump documents there'll be some
things that were there and you wish they
weren't and they're not that important
don't you think
so it's University pen blah blah
yeah GSA you pack those boxes yeah I
think it's going to be another bunch of
nothing and I think it's just a story
that uh because it mirrors the
Mar-A-Lago documents that's what makes
it a story I'm not even sure it would be
a story if not for the Mar-A-Lago
documents I doubt it's important
if it were important don't you think
they would have told us what the
documents were about
don't you think
because it's not like the Mar-A-Lago
documents where they say there's
something in those boxes and we don't
know what
that's different they actually know what
the documents are they they have
possession of the documents so if they
were let's say nuclear secrets
I think you would know that
right wouldn't that just be part of the
story so my guess is it's just sort of
background context
that was useful and somebody did
something they shouldn't have but
probably not that big a deal
yeah so my guess is just over classified
stuff and nothing there but it's a good
political story it'll get people
yammering about how unfair Things Are
all right I think I mentioned this that
uh Washington Post reported that the
so-called Russian influence operation
uh on Twitter was a big nothing
that it didn't have any impact at all
now
I feel is important
to call out when I made a correct
prediction because predicting stuff is
largely you know part of my credibility
or not
and I would like to claim
that I am the number one and maybe only
person
when the the Russian influence story
first came out and when we saw the memes
so when we saw the memes and we knew the
budget
I said loudly in public oh it's obvious
this had no impact
because I saw the memes
I saw the memes and they were they were
looked like they were grade school level
and then I heard the budget like a
hundred thousand dollars for their
entire operation
it was obviously a nothing
so
those of you who follow me
can you confirm I was the first person
to tell you this that there was nothing
to it
and and there was obviously nothing to
it right and so now the Washington Post
has confirmed what I told you which was
also obvious from the first moment
obvious yeah and the people and locals
are confirming that that I called
 in that all right now
here's something that I can say on live
stream that I would not say on Twitter
perfect example if I said the same thing
I just said on Twitter
people say oh my God you just think you
get everything right you never admit
when you're wrong
no
on live stream I can say well I don't
get them all right
I can list which things I got wrong for
example most notably recently predicting
that Russia would not invade Ukraine
I tell you I got that one wrong all the
time I predicted you know Trump's vice
president pick incorrectly I admit that
I wrote a whole book about all the
things I got wrong
now on live stream I say that so that
it's easier for you to accept oh I got
this one right
because I also admit when I got them
wrong and you say oh that's balanced but
on Twitter I would just say I got it
right
and then they say Claude Adams because
that's the only context they have and
they would all turn into idiot uh idiot
Robert Barnes
so
anyway the Twitter files continue to uh
uh offend us
um
yeah Tucker Carl said a great thing
about how many times the Democrats have
used Russia as their excuse yeah cope
uh
and it's amazing if when you hear the
whole list you forget how many times
um
the Russia was used as a uh an excuse
for any bad behavior
now I made another let's say if you
remember this or maybe I have a false
memory of it so check me I might have a
false memory
I've been saying since the beginning
that every accusation of Russia
uh hacking the DNC or Hillary's emails
or whatever they're hacking I've said
that those are fake
most likely and that our own
intelligence agencies are lying to us
about all of it
I'm gonna I'm gonna double down on that
I don't think Russia hacked anything
I don't believe that
Maybe
but they it seems like they can't even
hack Ukraine and they're pretty
motivated to do that I just don't think
they have much of a cyber operation
frankly
so who knows somebody probably hacked
somebody but I don't know that it was
Russia
um if you if you look at the pattern
you'd have to say it's most likely
untrue wouldn't you
so so far everything our intelligence
agents have told us about Russia was a
intentional lie
right so Russia collusion was an
intentional Lie by intelligence people
current and retired the Russia laptop
was a lie
and the Russian influenced the level of
influence they had in cyber stuff was a
lie now that's three lies that involve
Russia they have our own intelligence
backing
what is the only only information we
have that Russia hacked anything
our intelligence people said so
that's it there's no other information
so the least credible entity in the
United States which is our own
intelligence agencies when blaming
Russia all right and here's another
thing that you can say on live stream
that I wouldn't bother to say on Twitter
most of the intelligence people are
probably just good people doing their
job and their Patriots and we love them
right
but but if I said it on Twitter it looks
like I'm you know blaming all
intelligence people for all everything
it looks like a few members of
leadership
are bad apples and they they were behind
all of these things so it's a very small
percentage of the intelligence people
see the difference
if I say the same thing on Twitter
without the context and so um then I
become a different personality I I'm a
conspiracy theorist and I'm blaming you
know I hate the United States
and nothing like that's happening
all right
um
so yeah I don't believe anything about
Russian hacking of American
anything really
um
did you see that uh idiot Robert Barnes
I forget if I mentioned this he he
tweeted or he wrote in his blog that I
personally
the creator of the Dilbert comic strip
M uh two gullible and believing
institutional data
does that sound like a good analysis
I'm literally the world's most famous
doubter of institutional information
if you were to take all eight billion
people on the planet Earth
and rank them by how much how
prominently they've doubted
institutional information I believe I'd
be number one
out of 8 billion people
now Robert Barnes imagined that
I was believing and I was highly
gullible and I would believe
institutional information
when really I should have been believing
Rogues
I don't know he he's kind of ridiculous
now it looks like he's having some kind
of a meltdown doesn't it
is anybody watching Robert Barnes
reaction to this it looks like a
meltdown because the things he's saying
about me are actually they border on
insane yeah
yeah
and the the clot Birds
um you can tell the clot Birds they're
weighing in now on YouTube the club
birds are all confused why I got
vaccinated right
that's confusing because you don't know
the context
if the clock Birds followed me on a live
stream more religiously than they are
right now they would know that I made
the same decision as uh Dr Robert Malone
the one of the most prominent critics of
the vaccination policies say the same
thing he did it at the same time
and for the same reason
I think he waited until you know we saw
what adverse reactions were right away
that's not all of them there could be
but we you know if you've gone six
months your odds are much better and
then
no not not so he could go on vacation
with my ex-wife but so he could fly
internationally
that's why I did it that's why a lot of
people did it
so if you didn't know that context and
you were on Twitter you say cloud Adams
you must be in favor of the vaccination
if you watch me on live stream you know
that the reason I waited six months when
I could have gotten it right away
I was you know I was qualified early on
because of my age and comorbidities but
I waited as long as I could
until the travel thing became too hard
to resist and the reason I waited was
why why did I wait so long
there's only one reason I waited is
because I didn't trust institutional
data
why else would I wait
if I trusted it I would have signed up I
would have been first in line because
nothing would have stopped me
right
so so I think Barnes is having some kind
of a mental breakdown
um terrible meltdown you should you
should express your empathy
because he's going he must be going
through something in his personal life
that's that's horrible
I'm probably some kind of
you know not a marital problem or
something I can only speculate but he
seems to be acting out in a way that
suggests a terrible mental breakdown
how many people think I'm serious about
that
no I'm not serious
it's sarcasm you can't you cannot
diagnose diagnose somebody's mental
state by their tweets
foreign
but he's doing it to me so I was just
returning the favor none of it makes any
sense do you think I know how he feels
when he's not tweeting of course not he
could be
good Lord the storm is really loud
I'm gonna have to check outside to see
if my
if my landscape blew away
all right um
sad news uh Diamond of diamond and silk
passed away at age 51. no cause of death
but I did read that she had been sick
for a while so whatever it was was not
sudden and that's quite tragic and
not much else to say about that yeah I'm
just we'll just show our respect and
note that I think that they were
the by the way for some reason I didn't
know they were sisters
did you all know they were sisters I
just thought they were best friends
but they did act like they did act like
sisters because they were beyond the
same wavelength yeah is that where how
could I go so long without knowing that
because I I don't remember them ever
being referred to as sisters they were
always just diamond and silk
and I thought they did a great job of
like maximizing their potential and
everything the the David and silk story
is
a real good one to look for Success
strategies
and I would say one of their best
superpowers which I talk about all the
time is I don't think that they ever got
embarrassed
am I am I wrong like they could go on
and just put on like a a really good
like show
because they were never embarrassed they
were just you know put themselves out
there now that's something to be
um respected
and also to be imitated
you know they they put themselves out
there they took a risk the worst thing
that could happen to them
was they'd have a bad day on social
media and then they say oh I guess this
isn't for us right
it was the exact right kind of risk risk
reward that I always recommend if the
only risk is you spend an hour
on social media and then some people
mocked you but not many people saw you
and you decided it wasn't for you
that's a perfect risk right low low risk
high potential payoff and they took that
risk and they get a high potential
payoff so
good work for them good instincts good
good contribution to the to the whole
um
when somebody passes away we're only
we're only going to do the the positive
parts of their life you understand that
right
so we're just doing positivity today
um
here's a strategy I think Trump could
win
the White House on
here's what I knew if I were Trump all
right you know he's uh he's CL and by
the way this would work for DeSantis or
anybody else but it would work
especially well for Trump
um so he's being closed out by the
um the media
so the mainstream media is going to
close them down including probably fox
now that might change if he gets
nominated might change if it gets
nominated but at least during the
nomination phase he's going to have to
play it non-traditionally
here's how I do it
I would say I'm only going to do
podcasts
because everything he does on a podcast
is going to get turned into a clip and
and become viral he'd be on every real
and every tick tock and it would be real
easy to share it and stuff but the but
the content of those
um
those videos
should be partly from interviews he does
in podcasts
because of podcast form is the best form
for him because a podcaster could push
him hard right now I do plan
that when I leave my uh media
um at the moment I'm on a media diet so
I'm not doing any interviews or I'm not
appearing on other podcasts for most of
this year
and
but I'm certainly going to offer to
interview Trump if he's if he gets you
know into the process deeper
now do you think he would say yes
do you think Trump would appear on a uh
podcast or live stream that has only
you know 50 000 viewers on a good day
yeah because the 50 000 viewers is
irrelevant to the reach the only thing
that matters is if he and I created a
viral moment where there's like a 10
second clip or something that's really
good that's all that matters because
that that's the win it's not anybody
watching the interview
then secondly if Trump does anything
interesting on a podcast it doesn't
matter how many viewers the podcast
normally gets it's going to be a trump
number it's not going to be a podcast
number right so he can make anything big
so he doesn't have to go on to a big
platform he can go on a little platform
and then let it and let it expand
next thing I would do is I would create
a series of very short maybe two minutes
at most a minute would be better but two
minute videos on each policy
just two minutes so that nobody could
ever doubt what his policy was
and then I think you need some work on
those policies because if he presents
his policies the same way he always did
I don't think it's good enough
I think he needs an upgrade in his
persuasion
so but if he did that and he made these
little one minute videos they'd be very
powerful then the other thing and here's
the kill shot
the kill shot is he should do a series
of very short videos
you know one minute-ish uh debunking
each of the uh conspirac the theories
each of the hoaxes against them
imagine Trump creating a video that
shows the tweet that was live at the
time and the Wall Street Journal article
talking about light as a disinfectant
and then pick out the parts of his
speech where it was light light light
show how the The hoax was created and do
it all in one minute
because because each of these points is
like a five or ten second point you
could put like six ten second points
together and debunk any hoes so you know
you do the fine people hopes you do the
drinking bleed jokes you do the
um and then he would have to have to
answer the question
for example why did you say you were
just being sarcastic
now he's never answered that question
but I think the easy answer is I was
just trying to brush it away because it
was just a hoax story I just wanted to
make it go away
which I think anybody would believe
don't you
because it obviously wasn't sarcasm
whatever it was it wasn't sarcasm so you
would believe him if he said you know
honestly it was just a stupid story and
I didn't want to be I didn't want to be
the president discussing covet
technology like that's not my role I was
just brainstorming and maybe it was
better I don't do that so I was just
trying to make it go away
that would totally satisfy me
would it satisfy you
if he said yeah I mean honestly
obviously it wasn't sarcasm it was based
on something I saw but I just didn't
want to pursue it just wanted to make it
go away
so
once he's created a one-minute debunk of
each hoax then the next thing you do is
you put him in a compilation clip
so they each would live individually but
also they would be short enough that you
could put them into a like 20 hoax
compilation clip
you you put the hoax videos together
with the quick policy videos that are
really tight and well and better than he
usually says them
put them on podcasts
I think he's Unstoppable
now I think January 6 has to be one of
the hoax the hoaxes
I I think he has to present it as
um the the reaction to it was political
now at the same time the only way you
can do that credibly is to admit that
members of the protest went too far and
some of them probably wanted to do the
worst possible things he can't deny that
you know the parts that are in evidence
but and and I think going after the
rayapps thing
would be
it's going to sound conspiracy theorist
Theory like to the people he's trying to
persuade so that's no good
rather I would rather see him mock the
January 6th thing the way we do
which is just ask this question
do you really believe the Republican
stage and Insurrection and don't take
their weapons out
does anybody believe you can conquer a
country by occupying a room
I mean just he should just make it sound
stupid because it is it was just a show
trial now the things he says are stuff
like show trial it's political but
you're so used to hearing those types of
things they don't really register
I'd rather say something that you don't
hear which is do Republicans try to
overcome a country without weapons in
what reality do you think that really
happened
you know we'll acknowledge that there
were bad people there and they should be
you know the law needs to take care of
that but really really you really
believe the Republicans don't bring guns
to a coup
I think he should mock it away
he should mock it away
you should not even go for the like too
factual you know don't don't uh retry
the you know the public hearings just
mock it away it's like come on
who believes that really
uh
and I think that makes the president
all right here's my updated uh Ukraine
prediction
um
the winter is going to be really good
for Ukraine
here's why
number one uh the ukrainians will be
wintering in their own country meaning
that I would imagine
there would be plenty of locals who
would keep the military warm and we'd be
happy to do it right so there's always
going to be an indoor place for the
Ukrainian military
the Russians still probably confined
indoor places but you know it's a little
harder and if they Clump up too much the
ukrainians will send the high Mars in
and take them all out so it's a little
bit I think the Russians are gonna have
a little harder time over the winter
um but apparently and I was anticipating
this if you give the ukrainians extra
time
what happens
they get extra weapons
right
so ukrainians have a good winter because
there won't be much fighting so they
won't be doing much losing but
apparently they just they're going to
take possession of like 50 Bradleys
which is a whole new level of
Effectiveness if you've got 50 Bradleys
you know these fighting
vehicles uh and you send all 50 of them
into a russian-held territory
you get the territory back
now I know I'm no military expert but
that's just what they you know the
people who know what they're talking
about and say if you send you know you
created a force with 50 Bradleys against
the Russian forces they would recapture
that territory
so now the now the ukrainians are moving
from defensive to offensive forces and
they've got a few months to get all the
stuff in place
um
now Russia also has the full winter to
resupply
but where is where is Russia getting
their resupply from
mostly from Russia
so I've got a feeling that the Russians
don't have as much to resupply like they
would have already been using everything
they had because they were you know not
doing so well so it seems to me that the
advantage is going to wildly turn toward
Ukraine as soon as the snow starts
melting
does anybody have a different prediction
because I think ever let me say it
simpler every day Ukraine gets stronger
and every day Russia gets weaker because
of sanctions and you know running out of
stuff
so I believe that the winter is only
good for the one who benefits from extra
time
so it should be Ukraine
uh
[Music]
yeah I don't think anybody thought that
high Mars were all that was needed
admit that you are very unbalanced on
Ukraine uh here's a perfect example
if I if I were on Twitter right now and
just made that prediction you would say
to yourself but Scott you were so
unbalanced you just always say good
things about Ukraine because that's all
we've seen on Twitter but on live stream
somebody says but you're so unbalanced
about Ukraine
I've also been right about everything
except the invasion which I was as wrong
as you could be now the reason I was
wrong about the invasion
is that it looked obvious to me
that it wouldn't work
and I thought it would be obvious to
Putin
now apparently I was right about the
part it not working
the best best prediction on the Ukraine
war after the worst one so I had the
worst prediction that they wouldn't
they wouldn't go in but it was based on
the best prediction that if they went in
they get their ass kicked
which is what happened
so
if you'd like more balance
allow me to have it here's some balance
can we trust any of the information
coming from Ukraine or Russia that would
suggest who's winning
no
right does that sound balanced that all
of the information is non-credible
that helps right because if you're
saying why are you latching on to this
information and acting like it's true
that's not happening
no no I'm I'm presenting what's in the
news
and I'm doing you know what if it's true
and if it's true this might happen but
the prediction about the winter
is is a straight observation that one
group has unlimited sources Ukraine the
other group has probably more limited
sources
so the one with unlimited sources should
do better if you have more time
now that's pretty straightforward
now does that mean that Russia will be
destroyed
now Russia still has nuclear weapons
Russia has you know weapons they haven't
used Russia could decide that they're
they're willing to take you know massive
losses instead of what losses they've
already taken that are big so yes
and in in war
this is one of those things I always
imagine I don't need to say
but on live stream I'll say it and on
Twitter I wouldn't because I F you are
characters would you agree that nobody
can predict War
agree
so if I tell you wow it looks like
Ukraine is going to win
that's in the context of nobody nobody
can predict the war
but we still predict the reason I
predict is that I predict everything I
can so you can see if my predictions
were at least reasonable even if they
don't work
because my prediction that Putin would
not attack
I think was reasonable
because it was based on
you know a very good assumption that
turned out to be true I was just totally
wrong
but it was reasonable and I think that
that's part of how you judge my
credibility
you see if I can predict right
but predicting well might be
sixty percent correct right
and when it's War I think that's even
the hardest to predict like how many
people predicted that uh Russia would
not win in Afghanistan and the United
States would not win in Afghanistan well
some did Okay some did
yeah actually probably a lot of people
did it's a bad example but generally
speaking you would all agree that war is
unpredictable so does it help you
if I admit that all the information is
not credible there's definitely a path
for Russia to turn it around and win
everything
and that is uh largely unpredictable
but still
uh my prediction is not based on my love
of a Ukraine
does that make sense I'm not I did have
a Ukrainian flag in my profile but that
was ironic I was doing that as a joke
um
are you willing to accept at least at
least in the locals platform are you
willing to accept
that uh is not my love of Ukraine that's
driving anything
because
I'm more just an observer really
but I will say
and
um
I know this is not popular
it's entirely possible that the Biden
administration's handling of the whole
Ukraine Russia thing
will be looked at as one of the Great
American foreign successes
it doesn't look like it at the moment
would you agree
doesn't look like it at the moment
right now if you're laughing I'm
agreeing with you at the moment that
seems ridiculous doesn't it would you
all agree it looks ridiculous at the
moment
I think we're all on that page here's
but here's the part where it could
change
if it turns out that we spend let's say
100 billion when it's all done and the
net result was that Russia became no
longer an adversary
they became weakened and are let's say
our energy industry picks up the slack
that some of the slack that Russia
leaves by not being a good partner
it's going to look like the United
States
played a right
it's going to look like the U.S didn't
lose people Ukraine did we spent 100
billion to get something we easily would
have spent 100 billion on if you'd if
you'd proposed it for example if you
said the United States all right for 100
billion we'll guarantee that Russia goes
from a like a top
a top
opponent to you know somewhere down in
the ranks we'll make them less dangerous
and less important
would that be worth 100 billion
it might be
if you if you could degrade if you could
degrade degrade China
by as much as Russia will be degraded
would that be worth 100 billion dollars
I think so
that sounds like a bargain actually
so I think the thing you're gonna have
to wait for is how it all turns out
there's definitely one possibility and
I'm not sure what I wouldn't put like
high odds on it necessarily but there's
one substantial possibility that this
will look like one of the greatest
foreign policy successes in the United
States
as possible
it's equally possible
it destroys the world
it's equally possible Ukraine is nothing
but the worst thing we ever got into
will you accept that could go either way
but if you're ignoring that it could go
wildly in both directions then I think I
think that's not fair
right
can I get you a degree with this
that it's possible it could go wildly in
either direction wildly successful based
on what we've already seen
but also wildly you know Russia's
unpredictable could it could be wildly
bad
right does that sound balanced or not
I feel like that's balanced
all right so I've got some pretty stuff
now now you can see clearly the
difference between live stream and
tweeting right
everything I said after the first
comments would not have been in a tweet
so so on
on Twitter I'm a pro Ukraine
um I guess on Twitter I'd be a pro
Ukraine crazy person
it would look insane
but on live stream I look like a you
know reasonable person who could be
right could be wrong
but it's not crazy
all right
did England win the war against our team
Argentina yes they did
uh you sound very anti-russia
well
that's that's correct
somebody said I sound very anti-russia
they are an adversary
is it not coming through that I think
our adversaries should be treated
differently than our friends
is that confusing
yes you do that is in pricelessly what's
my imbalance that I'm too anti-russia
well to be clear I'm a I'm pro-russians
pro-russians I've said forever Russia
should be our Ally is there anybody who
said more often than I have that Russia
should be our Ally and we should start
treating them that way and see if we can
make that work nobody said it more than
I am
I've probably repeated that to the point
where you're sick of it
Russia is a natural Ally of the United
States Putin isn't necessarily
so it's I'm definitely not anti-russia
I'm as pro-russia as you could possibly
be because I think the Russian people
are kind of Awesome
kind of Awesome
but and they should be our allies just
need different leadership
how is Russia an adversary
um
they're an adversary in the sense that
they have nuclear weapons pointed at us
and they can make our work harder in
some places
so but um to your point I'm more I'm
more empathetic to your point than you
think because my larger point is that
there are not enough reasons to be
adversaries so you ask the right
question the correct question is
are are the problems we have with Russia
enough
to call them an adversary and the answer
is yes
but I think it's not so much that we
couldn't get rid of it
in other words it's something you can
work with and you can you can manage
that down
because it's not that that bad
uh
uh yeah we made them our enemies I think
I think there's something to that I do
think our actions
change their behavior for sure
yeah we share the International Space
Station you know
that should be all you need to know
right
like you know the fact that we that
we're cooperating on the International
Space Station and and I've said before
that the the pitch to Russia is to
cooperate in space
see this is something that Trump could
say because he's smart and other
politicians just wouldn't say it but
Trump could say out loud hypothetically
you know let's think of the future
the the thing that's going to be really
important is you know military control
of space and China is going to be up
there
do you think China is going to share
their stuff with Russia because they
like them
I don't think so
but I think we we could work with Russia
and say look we already cooperate on the
International Space Station
let's cooperate militarily in space
and make that make that the reason to
cooperate on on earth right to say all
right the big picture is we have to be
on the same side when space is the
Battleground we have to it would be
insane for Russia in the United States
to be on opposing size in space
that would just be nuts
but China is going to go its own way
and threatening or not it's going to be
a force in space that needs to be dealt
with and we're going to be a lot better
off if Russia is on the same team we are
a lot better off so that's the pitch
come together in the future
uh
all right
uh so it's insane to be so defensive
definitive uh yeah it would be insane
uh it would be insane to be
um just anti-russian as a reflex
absolutely but we we should be open to
bringing them onto the team
that that should be the play period no
matter what's happening
our our stated intention should be to
get them on our team
and by the way here's your persuasion
lesson for the day
this is like the simplest persuasion
lesson
if you want something to happen
you have to State it directly
just say what you want
and as unlikely as it is putting it out
there as what you want does make a
difference because as soon as it's out
there as a yes or no proposition then
people people will be drawn to it as a
yes or no and then you've got something
going so so even though everything is
terrible with the United States and
Russia I would love to see our leader
whether it's Biden or anybody else Trump
to say look in the long run
Russia and the United States are going
to be partners
and just say it as a fact
don't say it's a wish don't say it's a
desire in the long run we're going to be
on the same team
we Trump said that
I never heard him say that
I'm going to question that because I'm
sure I would have seen that quote but it
but if there's a quote where Trump said
anything like that I would love to see
it but the the wisest leadership
position would be you know we're going
to be on the same team
there's there's no way around it
so let's start now
now I I don't think you could do that
right now well while Ukraine is Raging
but
I I feel you can even give uh Putin a
win
on paper you're you know one of the
problems is Putin needs to get something
out of out of his actions right he needs
to show that he won and what would be a
better win for everybody involved
than to form a space Alliance
before anybody's got any real spaceships
except for the ISS
right
it would look like a wind wouldn't it it
would be Russia Russia would actually
um establish itself as a space force
and that would give Putin something to
say not only not only did I solve things
on the ground you know maybe we work on
a deal with NATO or something and stop
fighting so you know you know the
Ukraine war is going to wind down
so you could say the reason I'm winding
it down is that we've reached not just
an agreement on Ukraine
but all of space
Putin can sell the hell out of that and
we would be happy if he did right
wouldn't you be happy if Putin could go
to his own people and say look
you know this was all ugly and certainly
was worse than we expected and you know
that's on me but we got something really
good we got a permanent Arrangement on
the ground because I think they'll get
there eventually but we also
have a path into space that's far more
important than what was happening in
Ukraine
uh
you don't watch or listen to Trump since
2020 you said before that too well send
it to me
oh okay let me see
Trump says he would consider alliance
with Russia over an Islamic State and
that's not the same and an alliance over
a specific topic is not what I'm talking
about
so I I do agree with you that Trump said
we could work with Russia on specific
things like terrorism and stuff that's
not even close to what I'm talking about
I'm talking about like literally
treating like Great Britain you know
eventually
uh yeah space force is still around
doing great
oh is that right is one of the reframes
that Russia invaded to stop Ukraine from
going on an offensive
in those same in the contested areas
yeah
by the way there's a uh
I forget where it is is it on Netflix
there's a series on Richard Branson and
the starting of Virgin
which was way more interesting than I
thought it was going to be I didn't
realize that he was he was on the brink
of bankruptcy
pretty much the entire time until he was
rich
like like he was always like basically
he was broke and everything had gone to
Hell a whole bunch of times from the
time he was a you know a record record
store to the time he started an airline
like every part of that was
pretty sketchy but uh he made it all
working then
he lost six satellites
were some satellites damaged last night
with the solar flares or did or was it
just one rocket that didn't work
I don't know anything about any
satellites or there was a launch that
failed a virgin launch
with a virgin
oh it was a virgin launch and it didn't
work
well I guess
I guess Elon Musk has a big Advantage
there you know I don't think we can
discount how important it is
that musk is the engineer as well as the
company owner
because I I can't see uh Richard Branson
being the Right leader for a technical
project
right now you can argue that having the
airline is technical but it's such a
well understood technical that that's
different
but going into spaces inventing
something new and I don't think there
that Richard Branson is the Right leader
for that
but musk is
because you know musk can just say why
are you doing that unplug it if it's
nothing
Bezos and blue origin yet well
um
no
Bezos doesn't have a technical
background does it or does he what it
what is Bezos educational background
he's not an engineer is he
banking Financial
yeah you built Amazon
and that's impressive but I would argue
that uh Amazon is a little bit closer to
extending current technology than going
to Mars going to Mars you have to invent
the whole process
but Amazon was taking something that
existed you know websites and they they
grew as the technology for
the internet grew I think they just grew
with it I'm not sure that they were you
know in some ways like their uh server
farms and stuff
they were leading the internet I think
you could say but mostly they just
followed the technology so Bezos I think
it would not be the right head of our
rocket company
yeah they were brilliant in their
marketing and sales and psychology and a
whole bunch of things
they did some inventing on Logistics
that's true
um but as did Walmart right yeah but
Logistics is something that a smart
operator can do right building Rockets
to Mars is not just not something a
somebody who's good at Finance can pull
off
yeah
all right question for you
as we have reached the end of my
prepared remarks
um I understand that my my image here on
YouTube and probably Rumble is a lower
grade than it should be it looks like a
720.
because I have I have the 1080 1080
um
set
but for some reason it's coming through
a 720. my camera is 1080.
this looks about it is it only because
the lighting I'm going to change the
lighting and see if that changes it
hold on see if I can reach it
I can't reach it
that was that
better
all right so you think it was just the
light that gave it the bad
bad luck yeah the uh
same resolution
all right
all right so maybe maybe it's a lighting
issue when I use the iPads uh the iPad
is so good in low light that I have to
have it dark in here
but it and it looks like on the iPad I'm
Overexposed right I look super white
uh so I'm not sure I can get both of
these devices
uh uh so I might have to
I might have to stream on
a laptop for
both of them
uh well I can't do I can't do the stream
yard stuff on the iPad
and my head is shinier all right all
right that's all I got for now best live
stream you've ever seen
uh let's go see what Claude Adams is
doing the my
my it's like my evil me
like I actually have an evil me
claw Adams
you know not everybody has one
but Robert Barnes is really mad at that
guy my evil twin right my evil twin
uh use a thermal cam
more makeup yeah I'm trying not to do
makeup
I mean I don't even shave I don't know
if you can tell but
because I have light here but I don't
even shave before I do this like I'm
literally in my pajamas
and I think you'll like it that way
don't you
by the way you're all aware that I'm
doing everything I can to not get bigger
right
is that obvious
can you tell I'm going out of my way to
not let this grow any bigger than
than you know I wouldn't want the locals
group to be more than ten thousand and I
think you'll stay well below that it's
like six thousand something
but it's not going to be better if it's
bigger I would make a lot more money
but it's not really the primary goal at
the moment
so I'll just uh I'll just wrap up with
this thought
if you've never had the experience of
going from having nothing to having
plenty
you wouldn't know what this feels like
but I'm at that phase of my life where I
kind of took care of myself
right and the people closest to me
and now I'm looking for something that
makes makes sense for waking up and
pleasure isn't good enough
like I wouldn't
I wouldn't wake up happy every day oh
it's another day of pleasure
I hate to say it but there's nothing I
hate more than too much pleasure like
I'll just be bored to death and I feel
like my life is worthless
so in order for me to feel like I'm you
know
part of life and that I'm doing
something useful
um I do this because to the extent that
people find uh benefit of it for their
life
um that makes me happy
and that that makes it all worthwhile
so that's what's going on
uh but there are people working very
hard to diminish my value
unfortunately they're mostly on the on
Twitter
and somebody oh here's the question for
you somebody said to me
um
that it's my own fault that people don't
understand me on Twitter
and I guess that's a yes or no for me
it's my own fault because I could Tweet
non-provocative stuff
right
but to be useful
as you've seen many times I like
attacking the arguments on my own side
if they're weak and if I do that on
Twitter it looks like you know I'm on
the other team and everything goes wrong
um
you would must seem to have similar
motivations yeah it's what happens when
you get enough for yourself
I mean think of Elon Musk he's a young
man
and he has he's you know at one point he
was the richest person in the world
why do you wake up
I mean it's fun I mean it must be fun
but he fills his day with work
I think work is the only meaning he gets
and the rest is just filling the time
before you do something meaningful
all right
um that's all for now
YouTube and Rumble
