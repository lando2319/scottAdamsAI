[Music]
hey everybody
come on in here well do we have some
stuff to talk about
have you ever noticed that a lot of the
news gets
packed into some days there are some
days when it's just
so much news you can barely stand it
well today is one of those days
i'm guessing that a lot of you did what
i did last night which is
binge on all the uh coverage of the
riots
and we're going to talk about that yes
we will
but first we're going to do a little
thing called the simultaneous sip and if
you've never experienced it
boy are you lucky it's your lucky day
this will be your first one
and all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass attacker challenge to stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better including the
damn
pandemic and the riots
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
i can feel the violence decreasing
with every sip
so raise your hand how many of you
remember the coronavirus
let me refresh your memory it was a
virus
uh that we believe started in china
killed a hundred thousand americans uh
but that was
that was in uh 2020.
oh wait it is 2020. what happened to the
coronavirus
wasn't that a big thing like not too
long ago
well it turns out the coronavirus is
apparently nothing we're worrying about
today
but we are worrying about a different
virus
an idea virus which is
what the antifa folks are spreading
now i would argue that ideas if they're
damaging ideas
operate so much the same as
a physical virus that you have to at
least
consider the same mechanisms for
treating it so in other words if
if you get the coronavirus what should i
do
well what i do if you get the
coronavirus is i stay away from you
so the most important thing that can
protect me from your virus
is information if i have information
i can oh okay you've got the virus all
right i'll stay over here for a while
but what about antifa
antifa is sort of like a virus in the
sense that
if if an antifa person spreads their
uh let's say their philosophy is that
what it is philosophy
that would that would destroy the
economics
of any host that was exposed to it
so right now you saw that these small
businesses many of them owned by
black citizens were destroyed last night
at least in part you know antifa wasn't
the only one there there were lots of
bad actors
but antifa was certainly part of
destroying the economics
of any host it enters now it's trying to
destroy the economics of the united
states
and by the way they say that i'm not
making that up that's
actually the explicit intention is to
destroy the economy of the united states
now how do you deal with a regular virus
you quarantine it
you get as much information as you can
you contact trace you quarantine it
so identifying it and having information
is
is really the primary thing that you can
use to fight a virus
i would suggest that we should at least
consider
a national registry for antifa
now the registry doesn't have to be a
government thing because i don't think
it's illegal to start your own database
and
and have people contribute to it now you
would of course have a problem that
people would put
wrong information in it so that would be
a problem
but if you require that people let's say
demonstrate
that there's some certainty that the
person has antifa they would have to
include let's say
a social media snippet or something like
that
so if somebody let's say somebody put my
name on there
it would only take a minute for somebody
to say all right
let's see your evidence that this
cartoonist is a member of antifa and you
click on it
and there are no social media links that
would support that
so you'd say okay that one that's not
real but
if somebody has social media posts that
say they're anti-fog or there's a
photograph of them at a
anti-far event or something and you post
it
wouldn't you say that's reasonably good
evidence
now i would think people just like a
credit report people should be able to
petition to have their name taken off if
they're not antifa
in fact maybe all it would take is a
statement that says no this is incorrect
you know i disavow antifa that would be
fair
but the question is social scoring
so here's the thing why is it that we
citizens
who are basically we could be infected
by antifa
either by their violence by their
destruction
physical destruction of our businesses
or
by the you know the the idea of getting
our heads and maybe turning us into
entity for ourselves
why is it that if our government our
government can't
stop them obviously uh
so if the government can't act against
anti-far
what would stop these citizens from just
saying all right
it's nothing personal but we have to
quarantine you
because it's an idea virus and
i would ask the following question
antifa
has a an idea of how they'd like to see
the future
is there any reason we can't give them
that future
so long as we keep them away from the
people who don't want that future
because i don't think antifa cares about
other people minding their own business
they only
the antifa seems to be concerned about
living within a system
that's not the system they want to live
in
can't we fix that can't we find
some territory in the united states it
wouldn't have to be gigantic because you
could test it
small you get a few square miles
and you take anybody who's an antifa you
say
how would you like to live here you
could just have whatever rules you want
it could be very egalitarian
it could be a socialism it could be
communism
it could be it could be chaos it could
be
a complete anarchy it could be whatever
you want
but just just keep your philosophy with
you
and just don't bother us
i don't see why we can't give them what
they want
i mean literally create antifa land
and just say look anybody who wants to
live here
and wants to live here without a
government and without
economics is welcome to do it
and we should just run a little parallel
experiment
and then whenever anybody gets you know
arrested let's say for
anti-fa activities we could give them a
choice
go to jail or go live forever in antifa
land or you know five years in anti-fall
land whatever the
whatever the sentence is because i got a
feeling that
going to jail
versus living in antifa land the land
that antifa
would define as the way they want the
world to work
i've got a feeling they would look
pretty similar to the person who was
there
you neither you know but in jail you're
not going to starve to death
that being the big difference
so
did you notice last night that the worst
way to get the news was from the news
and and i think there's an actual reason
for that
because a lot of the good news uh not
good
wasn't good but a lot of the let's say
the closest to the action most accurate
reporting was coming from individuals
with their phones
so if you looked at the reporting of the
professional news crews
they they would generally travel with
enough people you could tell it was a
news crew
i assume they've got some kind of a
cameraman with a proper camera
they've probably got press credentials
everybody knows of the press
but the problem with being a member of
the credentialed press
is that the police recognize them too
and you could when you're watching the
coverage
all you would see is the police telling
the credentialed press
to get farther back from the action so
every time i turned on cnn
cnn reporter was being pushed back from
the police
until they couldn't see anything but
i was just on twitter last night and i
came across jack murphy's
periscope feed so jack murphy if you're
not following him you should just
just do a search for jack murphy and
he was in the middle of the action and i
think the difference is that he could
simply look like an individual who was
attending the protest
so he had a mask on and he just fit in
with everybody else
he had a phone but lots of people had
phones i assume he
i don't know for sure but i think he
probably had some maybe ear buds or
earbuds or something and that was his
microphone slash
um you know when the way he was talking
to the periscope
but if you didn't see him live
in the middle of the riots when the
fires were starting
you really missed a show because so i
put in my own
my own earphones so i could i could hear
the action in stereo
just like i was on the street and then
i'm looking through jack's
camera you know his viewfinder and man
you were you were there
and you could hear his breathing uh and
his
you know his level of let's say what's
the right word
level of legitimate concern for his
safety
as well as for his city and there was a
real drama because there was a smallish
fire that got
set against some construction platform
stuff against a building that if the
fire had continued it would have taken
out the whole building
and given the state of things i don't
know if
fire crews could have even gotten there
and
you know there was a lot of other places
the fire crews were needed
i feel like the whole block would have
burned down so you're watching
um yeah so it's at jack murphy live
if you're looking for his uh twitter
feed so
thousands of us i think at one point
there were like i don't know
3.5 000 of us were watching live
as jack was in the middle of the action
way closer to the action than any of the
professional news crews
and you're actually you were afraid for
his safety
and you were watching a building maybe
go up in flames which could have been
you know
how many tens of millions of of loss
probably people die if you get that much
fire going
and it was you were really there
i mean i could not leave the feed
because he put me right in the middle of
the riot
and i i could feel it i could feel it
viscerally it was
it really it was an incredible moment
in understanding that the traditional
press
has some some built-in limitations
that i don't know if they can overcome
you know maybe they'll find a way to
adjust
but watching watching jack get into the
middle of the story
and then watching the professional news
crews that were kept by the police
so far outside the story that it wasn't
it wasn't worth watching really
it was nothing to see a big difference
there might have been something
important happening in terms of
how we get the news and understand the
news
i remember there was a quote i heard
it was a long time ago it was years ago
now
uh it was from mark cuban and i don't
know it might have been
five years ago or something and he said
a quote that i thought was crazy at the
time
but now it's completely true i think he
was just ahead of his time
and he said that if there's a big
breaking news story
he doesn't check the news he checks
twitter
because twitter is going to be faster
and and hit it from more angles
and you're going to you know quickly get
it and there's no commercials and
there's no
you know the opinion is easier to sort
through
and i remember at the time i thought
well that's not true
because i was using twitter i didn't
have many followers
and i wasn't really being exposed to the
stories the way i have now
but once you have a big account
as i do people start tagging you in
stories if they want you to boost
boost the signal so suddenly this
morning i just opened up my twitter
and i've got just the highest quality
of videos and stuff you know a lot of it
from
andy know and i'm not sure if i'm
pronouncing his name right ngo
how do you pronounce that um but anyway
andy's got
tons of videos so you know i follow him
and so i'm seeing i'm seeing raw you
know on the ground
footage of people being beaten and just
horrible
stuff but i didn't see very much of that
on the regular news
because i don't know if the regular news
is censoring that stuff because it's a
little bit too
too rough or there or they just don't
have it
i don't know so watching the difference
of the quality of the news
from from citizens just doing their
thing
world of difference it's not even close
it's not even close the quality of the
reporting from the citizens
it's just way better than the pros and
there's a reason for it
so let's uh let's call the winners and
losers last night
so the biggest losers were the
african-american community
because they took an advantage that was
really
a gigantic opening i mean
yesterday or this week i'd say
based on the the george lloyd video
we saw this incredible opportunity
where people on the far right and the
far left all had exactly the same
opinion for the first time
which is all right you know the people
on the right who might have been a
little resistant
to the concept that police were
you know at least in some occasions were
being a little uh
not a little but in some occasions they
were crossing the line
and i think even people on the right who
sort of intellectually understood that
was probably the case
there's always a bad apple in the bunch
but
seeing it i'm sorry floyd
i always i i'm being corrected in the
comments
george floyd not lloyd uh
i confuse the trouble is george floyd
has two first names
and lloyd is a first name and i'm just
there's just too many first names to
keep
keep track of um but anyway
i would say that the the big losers were
the
black community because they had such a
gigantic opening
where the entire pretty much close to
100
of the white community and other
communities saw the same thing they did
on that video
of george floyd and we're on the same
side
completely on the same side in that
moment if anyone had come up
anybody prominent had come up with some
actual suggestions
of let's do this to make it better or
let's make this specific change
the whole country was ready congress
left right democrats republicans
just give us just give us a real
suggestion
we're all ready everybody wanted to help
all on the same side and then
antifa got involved and then
black lives matter made the strategic
error of all strategic errors in fact
historians may consider black lives
matter's
strategy in this as to be maybe one of
the worst
activist strategies of all time
unfortunately
because you know they have they have a
legitimate issue
and i think they they had the they
deserved
a legitimate response
they deserved a legitimate protest
and while there were many people with
good intentions there were too many
people with the wrong intentions
and really ruined the whole thing now as
i've told you
hey the dragon is docked somebody says
forget everything we're talking about
elon musk had just docked his
his rocket and nasa of course we don't
want to leave out nasa they're they're a
big part of the process
obviously but hey elon musk's
rocket just docked according to the
comments
well that just makes my whole day better
i gotta say
anyway my point being that we are visual
creatures
and because we're visual creatures if
you put up
one visual and then one concept that
takes some words
the concept that takes some words loses
to the visual so all last night we were
treated to the visual of
african americans mostly mostly
looting stores beating up white people
who we don't know what caused any of
these fights but
you know we see the the outcomes so i'd
say the african
american community uh lost
last night maybe more than i've ever
seen them lose in any one day in terms
of reputation
and empathy now if you're trying to make
things better for your community
the thing you need to do is not convince
your own community
it's not really about talking your own
people
into something because you're already
there the whole point of
activism is to convince other people
you want to change other people's minds
that's the whole point
yeah i i i can't switch switch modes
to watch it doc but uh we'll watch it uh
later
and uh
so my point is uh
my point is that because the visuals
were so overwhelmingly negative for the
black community
that i think african americans lost
just a tremendous amount last night just
a tremendous amount and i'm not even
talking economically economically a lot
of them lost their businesses
lost their jobs you know it was pretty
bad economically
if any of them were the store owners or
work at those stores and one assumes
that
it had to affect a lot of people but
it's really hard to wake up today if you
were
if you were let's say emotionally on the
side
of the african-american community let's
say you were not in that community but
you were emotionally
with them you're emotionally on their
side and you're
you're like yeah you know i saw that
video too
tell me what you need us to do i'll help
you
just tell us how to change something
give us a suggestion
we'll help you and that's all that's all
gone now
that was all squandered so i don't want
to make the mistake
that pretty much everybody's going to be
making from
all day long when they talk about this
the common dumb way to look at any of
this
is that the two percent bad people in
any of these groups that we're talking
about
whether it's the two percent bad police
or the two percent
bad black lives matter people if if any
of the bad people were in black lives
matter they might have just been
along for the ride yeah and then antifa
of course is
is more thoroughly bad that's not a two
percent situation
because they that's by choice that they
they they
they choose a philosophy so you can't
say that
only two percent of them are bad they've
they bought into a bad philosophy all of
them
so i think it was a devastatingly bad
night
for the black community they've lost any
goodwill that they might have generated
lost the biggest opportunity
in black i'd say the biggest opportunity
in black
history that is um
let's say more modern so obviously i'm
not talking about
civil rights or going back that far but
i'd say in the last
10 years perhaps the biggest
opening for the black community to have
a real
like real game just squandered last
night
completely lost completely lost
which is the gigantic tragedy so
basically the
the georgia floyd tragedy
became worse instead of becoming the
trigger that fixed everything and it
could have gone that way easily
so antifa i think has to take some of
the blame
i understand that there are some smart
people
uh including marco rubio who are
suggesting foreign adversaries
might have something to do with this now
in my opinion
if foreign adversaries do not have
anything to do with this
i would lose all respect for our foreign
adversaries
because this would be kind of an easy
one right
if you're a foreign adversary and you
want to cause a little trouble in the
united states and you know they do
this would be sort of a gimme
so if they're not if our foreign
adversaries are not
trying to take advantage of this well
then
they're certainly missing an easy play
so one assumes that there's some of that
but the ridiculousness of blaming any of
this on
uh white nationalists is
is almost laughable almost
so jake tapper was interviewing national
security adviser robert o'brien that
might have been this morning
and robert o'brien was saying that the
riots were driven by antifa
as opposed to any other group that's you
know being mentioned
and the weird thing about this is that
jake tapper
even this week was spreading the fine
people hoax
so is there some amazing lack of
awareness
that cnn is really the ones
i mean largely cnn is driving the riots
as much as anything
imagine if you will a world in which the
news
was just legitimate news just legitimate
but at the same time we got this video
of george floyd being killed on video
would you feel the same if you hadn't
been told
by the news you know that
the your understanding of the world had
not been framed
by the news would you feel the same
about it
and the answer is it would still be
exactly as bad as it
is you know the video is the video
but i don't know if people would have
connected it to the larger issues in
society
so much as they might have said well
that's you know a tragic situation
that involves these people and we need
to look into it but it's probably more
about these people
all right um
did you have the feeling last night as
you were watching all the
televised um rioting and stuff in the
protesting
did you have the feeling that you were
watching a televised sporting event
or maybe the beginning of the invention
of a televised sporting event and not in
a good way
like i'm not even joking about this if
this sounds like i'm making a joke
that's not where i'm heading i'm heading
i'm heading in the direction of
when i watch this i found myself
in spectator mode like i was watching it
like entertainment and
i wanted to try to talk myself out of it
as it was happening and i'd say
no no scott this is not entertainment
this is the opposite of entertainment
this is just
one tragedy after another you know one
injury
one bad thing happened to somebody a
story getting looted
is really just one horrible thing after
another that's what i'm watching
but the way it was produced you know the
way the news coverage handles it
there was something about the production
quality of it
something about the fact that the teams
had uniforms
and the police had uniforms auntie
anti-fog uniforms
black lives matter quite often had you
know black lives matter shirts on and
stuff
uniforms so you had uniformed players on
teams
there were rules of sorts there were
rules
and weirdly uh people seemed to follow
the rules you know the police had their
rules
antifa has a certain set of weapons and
tactics and they stayed within that
for example nobody in antifa pulled a
gun
right it's a country where pretty much
anybody can get a gun if they don't have
a criminal record i guess
and all of these antifa people there
probably most of them are
anti-gun but nobody pulled a gun
at antifa now that suggests
that they have a set of rules which is
okay
sticks and kicking and lighting things
on fire those are within the rules
but we don't use guns so
in a sense they were uniformed teams
uh the the goal of each of them seemed
to be
um real estate like football in football
you're trying to control territory and
the police were trying to control
territory
while the protesters were trying to
control territory
for the protesters scoring meant
destroying a business or setting
something on fire
or you know or being senseless
some some victim and
i i couldn't get past the fact
that there's something about the fact
that we don't have major televised
sporting events and then the way it was
produced
it just felt like a sporting event
right i'm not the only person who felt
this right
and again i it's possible to
to have complicated and conflicting
thoughts in your head at the same time
it's what makes us human right so you
can you can hold two thoughts
that conflict with each other in your
head so you can be watching it and
saying
this is the most horrible thing i hope
it stops right away
there's nothing good about it and you
can still have in your head
it's really entertaining you're like in
a sick
terrible way so i was having that
experience last night i wondered if
anybody else did
um so
that's the main things i wanted to talk
about it looks like
if i had to predict where this is going
i would say that like most viruses
it will burn out
i feel as though the
the idea of protesting on the streets
for racial equality
has been shown to be ineffective
let's see if we learned anything from
this now we did learn that a video
along with lots of social media
pressure is really really effective did
we not
wouldn't you agree that we have learned
that social media plus a
plus a damning piece of video plus
punditry
plus politics and everything that could
work really well
in terms of a cause what we also learned
is that if black lives matter has a
street
protest it will invite
both looters who just want to be
sort of hidden in the the crowd so they
don't get in trouble for looting
and it will also attract antifa who is
there for different reasons
now they might say we're also here
because of racism
but really they're there to destroy
civilization that's sort of their deal
so i think black lives matter should
have taken away from this
that street protests will always attract
those two elements
which will then attract the police which
then makes the black lives matter people
all the more worked up because their
whole thing they're protesting against
is aggressive police action and there
are the police
acting aggressively because these other
groups that are not black lives matter
necessarily have attracted police action
so um
yeah so i think that what black lives
matter
should have learned from this is to stay
off the streets
because that's an old-school way of
protesting
that because of this unique situation
with antifa
and because looting is now considered
just an automatic part of any street
protest
at least of that nature
i don't think street protests make any
sense anymore
so if you're in black lives matter let
me put it
as starkly as i can if you're an
organizer of black lives matter
and after watching this latest
experience
and you still bring your people onto the
streets tomorrow
or tonight let's say let's say today or
tonight
if you still bring people onto the
street organized
it's one thing if it's spontaneous that
people just do what they do
but if the organizers of black lives
matter
organize people to protest on the street
tonight after learning what we learned
then black lives matter i think has to
be
completely disavowed because there's no
way that that level of stupidity can be
rewarded and you can't claim that they
don't know
all right if they do it again tonight
nobody can claim they didn't know what
was going to happen
now here's the other here's the other
strange thing about this we are a
country with
approximately 50 trillion uh
personal firearms
we are a country with approximately 50
trillion personal firearms give or take
you know a trillion or two that's just
my estimate
so we have a lot of guns
did any civilian pull a gun on
anybody other than i saw i saw one story
of a shopkeeper who killed who killed
somebody
but of all those riots in a country
that's just
full of guns where were all the guns
i'm not suggesting that they should be
there that's not what i'm suggesting at
all
but wasn't there something unusual
about the lack of guns
um that and i'm wondering about that
because how long does the lack of guns
last because i would think that every
store owner who watched their entire
livelihood be destroyed
probably said to themselves i think i'm
going to get some extra guns
there's a cnn news scoop as somebody
says
yes and the the police were using these
paintball guns
uh which i thought was actually fairly
creative
because if you get hit with a paintball
gun you definitely
it definitely stings
uh 400 million guns somebody says 300
million guns
yeah did i miss it by a little
300 million not 50 trillion
all right i will accept i'll accept your
revised
uh yeah what was up with bow and arrow
man i've seen that reference was that
was that a reference from last night or
was there a different bow and arrow man
a cop got shot
antifa shot up an oakland police station
and killed the police officer
well i guess what i'm asking is why the
why the good guys didn't have guns
so um
it's one thing that the protesters had a
few guns
that's bad enough but there were no
second amendment people there
in any of them i think it has to do with
the fact that it's urban now the other
thing that we may have learned from all
this is that urban life
doesn't work i think we've learned that
if you want to be
susceptible to terrorism or coronavirus
or rioting or any of these things having
your shop destroyed just because you
happen
you just exist i feel as though if you
had
traffic and pollution and everything
else to it
that city living may be
maybe it's something that we just can't
tolerate anymore maybe it's just not a
way that humans should live
maybe they shouldn't live all crowded up
like that that could be part of the
problem
all right
uh
so in 2004 a college girl was killed
with a
with a paintball gun is that true
uh yeah some celebrities are paying to
bail out
protesters i wonder how embarrassing
that is today
but i also wonder if people on the left
are seeing the same
videos that you and i are seeing because
if i look at my video feed it's just
full of videos of people being
beaten to death or near death by
protesters
if if you're on the left are you seeing
those videos
or are you just seeing the video of
george floyd
and that's motivating you know you
bailing people out of jail
um
the somebody says the second amendment
team was not on the field
i think that's the whole story right
correct me if i'm wrong but all of the
legal gun owners
i'll bet you there were no shootings by
legal gun owners last night
how about that for a story you know i
always talk about the dog that doesn't
bark
how about this for a dog that didn't
bark
300 million guns in this country how
many how many of the 300 million do you
think are legally owned
would you say 200 million are legally
owned
i don't even know how to estimate that
but let's say there are
200 million legally owned guns in the
united states
and we had rioting in all of our major
cities and here's the question
was there was there even one unjustified
shooting by a legal gun owner
even one was there even one
legal gun owner involved in a bad
shooting
and all of this action last night
i don't know i haven't heard of one now
the shop owner who took out
somebody i don't know if that was a
legal handgun but i would call that
i'm not sure i would call that an
illegitimate use of
the firearms because he took out
somebody who was
taking out his life basically so
while i do not condone murder or
vigilantism
i do not condone them it is also true if
i watched
a shop owner kill a protester
if i had watched it with my own eyes a
shop owner killing a protester
to protect his life and his family's
economic situation
because the shop is going to be
destroyed and you know let's say they
don't all have insurance
if i saw that i'd be okay with it i'd be
okay with it
i don't condone it and i you know i
certainly don't encourage it
but if a shop owner killed a protester
to protect his shop
i you if you put me on that jury
i can tell you which way it's going to
go right
i don't even need to know the details of
what happened
if if the fact is a shop owner killed
somebody in the act of destroying their
shop
you put me on the jury i'm not even
going to listen to the evidence
that's it i'm not even gonna listen i i
will decide before the evidence
every single time because i'm gonna side
with the shop owner
doesn't matter doesn't matter the color
of the shop owner
or the color of the attacker irrelevant
if somebody's if somebody is just
threatening somebody's entire livelihood
their livelihood that's that's sort of
your life
right if you're a small business owner
the small business you know it's not
technically your life but it's sort of
your life
and if somebody's going to take that out
just for fun
just just because it's a fun riot and
they want to break some windows
want to ruin your business set it on
fire and that shop owner
ends up taking out a protester there's
just no way in the world
i could allow allow the rest of the jury
to convict that guy
so that at the very least it would be a
hung jury
but if i've taught you anything it's
that if you put a hypnotist
on a jury deliberation
it's kind of going to go the way of the
hypnotist right
unless there are unless there are two
hypnotists in the room
if you put me in a room with 11 other
citizens
and just say all right work it out
it's going to go my way all right it'll
either be a hung jury
or it'll go my way um
because that's how it works all right
um somebody says no one will put you on
a jury scott
maybe not now but i have been on a
number of juries
so i've been a jury four men i've been
on three
maybe so even even though i've been
recognizable
as a you know semi b level celebrity for
years
uh even then i would get put on juries
so they as long as you say you're
willing to do the job
it's pretty much all they need you just
got to be willing to do the job
and willing to say that you won't be
biased
uh so as a federal
service officer that they killed in
oakland so i don't know the details of
that i'll
probably find that on today
uh more killings last weekend in chicago
yeah all right so that's my idea of the
day is to start a registry for antifa
i don't know how anybody can you know i
asked the question on twitter
and this is a serious question how do
how does antifa eat
like actually literally how did members
of antifa
get food and i'm not joking that's a
serious question
because they're anti-everything
that produces economics and food
so do they use those things do they have
jobs
do they have regular jobs because how
can you be an antifa
and have a job it feels like that
doesn't make sense
if you're trying to destroy the system
that would include destroying jobs
why not just start by not having one see
how it works out for you
so let me ask you this if you knew
somebody
if you knew an employer employed a
member of antifa
would you use that company if you had an
option
in other words if if he knew one company
hired at least
one antifa person and he had a choice of
buying from another company that no
antifa employees
who do you shop with so i think
information
is the cure for coronavirus but it's
also the cure
for antifa and i'll leave you on that
and i will i'm gonna go watch the video
of the dragon docking now
you should too and i will talk to you
later
