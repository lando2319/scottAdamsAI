ah one moment one moment don't go
anywhere
i'll be back and here i
am well everybody good morning
good morning the simultaneous sip will
be coming in a moment
but first the first item of the day
are you ready i have some suggestions
for how to know what to trust because we
live in a world where
sometimes you can't trust everything you
hear can't trust everything you see
and i made a list of eight things you
should no longer
trust and here's the list never trust
number one scientist signing a letter
scientists don't need to communicate
by poll they don't need to communicate
by signing a letter if science is real
they might publish some papers they
might give some talks
maybe some interviews but one thing they
usually don't do is sign a letter so if
you see scientists getting together to
sign a letter
that's
case in point uh the
lancet article in which a bunch of
scientists were duped
into signing something that said well
there's no way that virus
could be coming from a lab must be a
naturally occurring virus
so don't trust anything that scientists
sign a letter about
number two don't trust any video clip
if it involves trump now most video
clips can be
edited maliciously
and maybe sometimes you could believe
some
but don't believe any video about trump
do you know that yesterday there was a
big
big controversy about whether trump was
wearing his
pants backwards
that's right much of the news cycle well
not so much the news cycle but the
social media
was obsessed by a video that appeared to
show trump wearing his pants
backwards because the fly area was blank
well it turns out that when you look at
the still photography from that same
moment he has his pants on correctly
and there's a fly there and everything's
fine but if you believed
the video well you violated rule number
two
don't believe any video about trump
number three don't believe any
complicated prediction models
do you know why you shouldn't believe
any complicated prediction models
because they're complicated prediction
models
and if there's one thing you can't trust
it's a complicated prediction model
sometimes they might be right but you
don't know when that time is going to be
you don't know if you're looking at one
that's going to be right how do you know
it's just a complicated prediction model
so don't trust those
even when they're right don't trust any
graph or chart on twitter
because twitter is not exactly the place
you put your good information
twitter is the place you take a chart
without the source
slap it up there without any context
whatsoever and claim you found
causality don't believe any charter
graph
on twitter number five don't believe
anything written by a
journalist i know it's a problem
because most of your news is written by
a journalist
so it's kind of a problem if you can't
believe
the people who report the news but let
me say this clearly don't believe the
people who report the news
that would be crazy there might have
been a time when that made sense
i don't know for sure maybe it made
sense when i was a kid i don't know
you know maybe maybe they were lying too
and we just never found out
but in 2021 if you believe something
because you read it
and it was written by a journalist
that's not good thinking
you should check yourself on that
number six of things you should not
believe in 2021 never believe any claim
made by a government any government
your government your enemies government
your allies government governments are
not in the business of telling the truth
it's not even what they do it's like
saying
hey my lawnmower is failing to fly
yeah yeah your lawnmower can't fly
because it's not really meant for that
your government is not meant to tell you
the truth
it's it's really not even i don't know
if you looked at a list of what they do
for
for you i'll bet telling you the truth
wouldn't be on the list
you're defending the homeland that's on
the list
yeah yeah lots of stuff is on the list
but telling you the truth
it's not even on the list it's not even
in the constitution
find in the constitution the part about
telling the truth
it's not there right it's not even an
expectation
here's the seventh thing you should not
believe in the year 2021
data data
because data is usually wrong if the
topic is
interesting the data is probably wrong
if the topic is boring and uninteresting
and maybe unimportant
well data might be right but as soon as
the important
as soon as the topic is important people
take sides
the data gets fudged don't believe data
now that's not to say all data is wrong
of course some of it is right
but don't just believe it that's a bad
that's a bad take and then number eight
which is
sort of overlapping with some of these
don't believe your own eyes or ears
if you find yourself saying this
statement
you've got a problem with your thinking
has this come out of your mouth in the
last
year or five have you ever said
i know it's true because i saw it with
my own eyes
or i heard it with my own ears or both
if you're saying things like that
you need to check yourself because you
can't tell what's true by seeing it with
your own eyes
fake videos fake data fake graphs
fake politicians you can't tell and you
can't tell by listening to it
because you might not hear it right and
other people are interpreting it
differently
and you may you might not know the
context so don't believe your eyes and
your ears
they're lying to you all day long so
those are the eight things you should
not believe in
scientists signing a letter any video
about trump
complicated prediction models any graph
or chart you see on twitter
anything written by a journalist any
claim made by a governed
yours or any other government data
and your own eyes and ears don't believe
any of that stuff
and now let's drink to that because i
know you're on board
all you need is a copper bungee glass up
tanker tell us a sign that can t
drive a flask a vessel of any kind hello
with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
what what yeah that's right everything
better it's called
the simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen now
go
those of you who got here a little bit
late aren't you happy
that you didn't mess this up yeah of
course you are
well it turns out that uh in our land of
uh
fake news turns out that that old virus
that virus that uh coveted 19 virus that
pesky little virus
which china told us was completely
evolved from
natural means probably some bat
uh bit somebody or a pangolin or
some damn thing but uh it turns out that
there's uh
this pesky little genome sequence
in the covet 19. and if you're familiar
with it it's the
cgg-cgg you all know what i'm talking
about right
yeah yeah i'm talking about the genome
sequence
cgg-cgg
known you we talk about it all the time
and it's one of um 36 sequencing
patterns
the covet 19 has it's one of the
patterns but
there's something about this pattern
something about this pattern which we
just learned
something about it did you hear
apparently there's something about this
virus which has
never occurred in nature never
as in as far as we know the sequence
this one sequence here has never
occurred in nature
but it has occurred it has occurred we
are familiar with it
do you know where it occurs only one way
we know it occurs
an engineered virus
it's the only way it happens that we
know of
now we're still open to the slight
possibility
that this would be the first time it
ever happened naturally
but it would be really really really
unlikely
doesn't mean it didn't happen but really
really really unlikely and so as
of today based on what we know
from additional unreliable sources
because remember all of your sources are
unreliable
the ones you agree with they're
unreliable
the ones you disagree with they're
unreliable too
so you know you get good luck figuring
out what's true but
as of today i believe that the common
wisdom
by all the smart people is that we are
now reversing
our default assumption the default
assumption is now
i believe let's see how today develops
right
but i believe that as of today all of
the smart people will say
the default assumption is that it was an
engineered
virus and there was engineered in the
lab and that it got out
now nobody's saying it got out
intentionally that
i still think that's crazy talk but got
out that wouldn't be a big surprise
stuff gets out of labs
it happens it's a fairly common thing
unfortunately
and so this puts the lie to
everything we had been told and as you
know there was a
uh a letter signed by a bunch of
scientists
that's right there were a bunch of
scientists who signed the letter
saying that no no no this virus
certainly was not engineered in any kind
of a lab
it's a naturally occurring virus how
many of the
scientists who signed the letter i think
who appeared in lancet
how many of those scientists who gave
their opinion in public
had studied the virus and are experts in
this topic
maybe none right
maybe none how many of them had looked
at all the genome sequences
and would be uh qualified to know
that if they looked at the cgg cgg
sequence where apparently the tells
for for being an ngo virus that's where
they live
just think about this for a moment there
was a letter signed by a bunch of
scientists
saying oh this is definitely natural no
doubt about it
at the same time other scientists who
apparently
know what they're talking about which
we'd be different than the people who
signed the letter
people who know what they're talking
about they actually knew where to look
to find out whether it was engineered
let me say this again slowly
and then i'm going to add a curse word
because it needs that treatment
send your children away the cursing is
on the way
so i'm going to say that say it again
slowly so this fully sinks in
there were people in our world who were
experts in viruses
who knew where to look on the sequence
to find out if it was engineered
they knew where to look
and also what to look for
always from the beginning
these people existed people who knew
where to look
and what to look for they were always
with us
are you kidding me
are you kidding me
there were people who knew where to look
and when they looked it was there
is your head exploding right now
my head is exploding is something
so wrong about this whole story
that i can barely handle it
and certainly science has lost us now
and it's not our fault
it's not your fault if you're denying
science
from 2020 on believing science
is stupid
 stupid so the next person who
says hey
i think you're a science denier you
should say
thank you oh my god i guess i've been
paying attention
i am a science denier and if you believe
the science
you are stupid you're a
if you believe science just because a
bunch of scientists told you
they just told you so it must be true
don't vote for though
i believe my science you're a
idiot if you believe science from 2021
on
now before this before 2021 i would say
you know maybe you hadn't been warned
maybe you just were unaware that
scientists could be this unreliable
maybe you just didn't know i think that
was reasonable
but from this day on literally this
 day the day we find out that
this letter signed by scientists
was always always
from this day on if you
if you believe science because the bunch
of scientists told you it was true
you're a there's no
there's no middle ground now that
doesn't mean that the scientists will be
wrong
shawn says is there a deep state for the
established establishment
scientific community well i don't think
so in terms of
you know something controlling all of
science i do think that each
field of science in each pocket of
science
has its influential people so in in the
specific sense
yes but not in some big generic sense
so that's the world we live in how about
that um
apparently according to rasmussen is
reporting today that biden's approval is
in a free fall
since may 31st which is not that long
ago
thank you kevin i appreciate that
um apparently independents have turned
on biden
so of course democrats still love him
republicans have always
disliked him but independents were sort
of split
and they just turned they just turned
this week
yeah michael says remember when twitter
and facebook would ban you for telling
the truth
well you know to be fair nobody knew
what the truth was
to be fair twitter and facebook were
also believing scientists
and again i'm going to say that if you
believed science
scientists up until the year you know
2020
21 that was pretty reasonable
pretty reasonable but if you believe
them from now on
you're just a idiot and you have
no credibility whatsoever
which doesn't mean they're wrong
obviously many times they'll be right
it's just that you can't tell the
difference don't pretend you can
um and they don't have credibility
anymore
credibility being different than being
right or wrong right
credible means that if they say
something
you're you're predisposed to thinking
well it's probably true
it's coming from a credible source but
they are no longer a credible source
and we need to recognize that so i'm
wondering what topic was it
that made bidens approval go into free
fall with the
independence do you know what would be
your
take on this what is it that caused
biden's approval to
suddenly drop in the last week
what do you think it is somebody says
inflation masks gas prices
maybe something about china russia
borders i don't know the debt
tax rates i don't know if i had to guess
i think
maybe tax rates people are starting to
worry about cyber security maybe
is it just everything maybe it's just
everything
um so i don't know too much about that
here's a fun topic um you're most of you
are aware
that logan paul just had a fight with
uh what's his name remind me the name of
the fighter he just
fought one of the best uh why am i
blanking on
who logan paul just boxed what's the
name what's the name of the boxer
yeah floyd mayweather only only one of
the greatest boxers of all time whose
name i could remember
so if you're not into boxing let me just
tell you the basics logan paul was a
youtuber but he trained very hard and
it actually became a credible fighter
changing careers and floyd mayweather is
aging but one of the best
boxers ever alive they just had an
exhibition match
and logan paul boxed them to uh to a tie
and i guess in the exhibition match
unless there's a knockout you don't get
a winner
so now i'm not sure that
mayweather fought as hard as he could i
don't know they both had a
something like a 20 million dollar
payday or some big number like that
and um here's the interesting part about
it
it turns out that logan paul uh
is an affirmations guy and
i i don't know if he believes that we
live in a simulation
i haven't seen anything about that but
he's very clearly talking about
affirmations here's a tweet
from logan paul in which he was getting
ready for the match
the boxing match and he said in his
tweet he said in 2015 i moved to los
angeles every morning and every night i
look myself in the mirror and repeat 10
times
quote i will be the biggest entertainer
in the world
i had no idea how or when it would
happen
but after six years of manifestation
it's happening
life is a wild ride do you believe that
do you believe that in 2015 he literally
every morning and every night looked in
the mirror and repeated 10 times i will
be the biggest entertainer in the world
well maybe not every single day but i
believe it
i believe it would be sort of a weird
lie to tell right
did it work do you think he accomplished
i will be the biggest entertainer in the
world
did he accomplish it you did
you did if only for one day
check your entertainment news for today
he's the biggest entertainer in the
world
today all the stories are about him
now he's not he won't be bigger than you
know kanye or michael jackson
you know in the long run right but today
he's the biggest entertainer in the
world he did it
he did it you know
unbelievable he did it
and um you know you could argue
whether he's the biggest entertainer in
the world you could argue how long is it
supposed to last
but one of the things i've told you
about affirmations
is don't make them specific
because when you make them specific you
might get them
exactly the way you've made them and he
did
he got exactly what he asked for he
became the biggest entertainer in the
world
but what was missing is four years
if he had said i'll be the biggest
entertainer in the world
for years well first of all that'd be
harder
and second of all it didn't happen i
doubt he'll be the biggest entertainer
in the world for years but he was today
he actually hit his mark
and you know when he talked about it
after after he was he was
quite inspirational actually talking
about how you shouldn't believe the odds
now do you think you should stay in your
channel
did logan paul take all the advice from
all the losers in the world
and say look and paul you're a youtuber
yeah you had some wrestling
experience i know you've worked out you
boxed i know you've got a little you
know
weight and height advantage over floyd
mayweather but really seriously
seriously you know is this going to work
out
and he he changed lanes and he made
i think 20 million dollars minus taxes
minus
you know managers and stuff so
um wow i love this story
i also love the sportsmanship you
probably saw logan paul
and mayweather you know going at each
other before the fight
after the fight after the fight floyd
mayweather said wow he was much better
than i thought gave him full respect
full respect oh is it net 10 million
somebody's saying ann marie
is that net for each of them 10 million
or are you just saying after taxes
after taxes would be half that yes um
all right well that's enough of that
i was asked the other day if the
simulation has a null hypothesis
which in regular english means
is there a way to prove it's false
because if you can't
disprove it maybe you can't prove it
so uh i don't have that so in other
words i
i don't have a a way to approve it or to
disprove it
but i want to just put this thought out
there
for your observation it goes like this
in my opinion my life has been
so close to what a video game should be
like
that i can't ignore it anymore and one
of the
one of the things that is very video
game like goes like this
i have a theme my whole life
starting when i was i don't know 10
years old
there's a theme in my life and i'm sorry
i'm not going to tell you what it is
but it's a theme there's a specific
problem
that i have over and over and over again
defeat you know going so far beyond
so far beyond what chance could possibly
deliver
now you might say to yourself scott
scott everybody thinks everything that
happens to them is a coincidence
because in a way it is everything's a
coincidence in a sense
explain it away with all your rational
thoughts etc and maybe you're completely
right
but watch for the following pattern is
there a theme in your life
do you have a theme is there a specific
let's say a character flaw you have or a
or a challenge that just over and
over and over seems to apply to you but
as far as you know it's just not
happening to other people
now of all the problems that i could
have it's infinite right
there are infinite problems that could
just arise that i don't know are out
there
just anything could happen but that
doesn't happen
instead my problems are clustered
and have been since i was 11
years old
one right after another and here's the
freaky part
each time i get a new challenge within
within my theme
and i beat it seemingly against the odds
i beat it as soon as it's beaten
within about no more than
three days usually two a new
problem that came that comes from
nowhere
will appear to replace the one that just
got solved
within the theme you know whatever your
life theme is
and this just happened to me again you
know it's happened to me countless times
but i've started predicting try this
my my belief is that the most accurate
view of reality is the one that predicts
several days ago i predicted out loud
privately
but out loud that i had just solved my
last problem in the theme
and that a new problem in the theme was
going to come out of nowhere
and boy did it wow
wow again you know you don't need to
know the
details of my little problems in life
but
i got i got the supernova of all
problems
solvable you don't have to worry about
me i'm not gonna die or anything
but oh my god
and i predicted it a few days before it
happened
i predicted it so it's the predicting it
that was the uh now your
your guesses are amusing but you're not
going to be able to guess it
and no that's not it but
watch watch this why are you all
guessing the same thing
no it's it's you're not going to be able
to guess it so
i'm just laughing at your guesses but
the point is
follow this in your own life and see if
your problems follow a theme
and if they do does the new problem
appear as soon as the old one is gone
because if it does you might be in a
video game
you might be in a video game here's
another
supposition if you play a video game
with say a friend
the two of you are inhabiting let's say
different avatars
and maybe the rest of the characters are
npcs just robots
how can you how can the two avatars that
know each other
in the outside world make sure they know
each other in the inside world and they
can tell the difference
between a real player and an npc
if we're a video game you probably would
need to be able to tell the difference
within the game
so you know which ones are real have you
ever noticed
that there's some people that seem real
in your life and there are others that
are there but they don't seem real
in other words there's some connection
that you never make with them they're
they're almost like scenery but there
are other people
that you know from the first moment you
see them oh
that's a real one come on you're on the
team
you know your teammate in the game as
soon as you see him
you know that's my teammate sometimes it
looks like
love at first sight sometimes it's
meeting a friend and you say there's
some reason i met this forever
like there's something about this friend
that's not like the other things
there's there's just something about
this person and your friends for life
so i just put that out there nothing
like a scientific proof
but fun here's a uh update on the
ivermectin
dust up so i've accidentally created a
little intellectual battle on twitter
between brett weinstein
and andres backhouse the topic is the
effectiveness of ivermectin
and brett recently did a
very well well done and well
viewed video with a doctor
dr corey was it in which
they talked about the many the many
studies that show ivermectin is
effective but each individual study
might be flawed or too small
or or have its issues but if you do a
meta-analysis of all of them
it becomes clear that ivormectin is
overwhelmingly
useful against the covet
now uh that all sounds very convincing
and as i said if you're just watching
one point of view
you walk away from that video saying
well that's pretty good and i don't have
anything to say about that
it all looks like it's backed by data
smart people did smart things with the
data and now they've got a conclusion
why would i doubt it
and then andres backhouse comes along
whose
expertise is economics and
that gives you the ability to compare
things and essentially be good at
analyzing data and situations like that
and andres points out that meta analyses
are not generally considered
a gold standard i'm i'm paraphrasing
here he didn't use those words
but the point is that there are lots of
smart people who would say
some version of this and one expert said
exactly this
in an article i just read he said that
if the signal is clear
in other words if you've got a bunch of
different studies that aren't that great
in their design but they all say clearly
the same
conclusion let's say let's say your
study
showed 100 success no matter what kind
of study you did
well if every study you do showed 100
success no matter how poorly designed
the study was
well probably it works right
and you don't need a meta-analysis
because you can just look at it and say
well it doesn't matter what we throw at
it
every single study no matter how poorly
designed
no matter what problems we put into it
is such a strong effect that you still
see it
all right when that's the case you don't
need a meta-analysis right
so if the signal is so strong you can
just see it by looking at it you don't
need the meta-analysis
but what if it isn't what if looking at
it is like i don't know
it's a little bit over the all over the
map maybe the results are
are not gigantic but they might be small
we don't know
if it's unclear then it turns out
that when you do the meta-analysis what
matters the most
is what assumptions you made
which which studies you said well we'll
we'll either leave the preprint studies
out or we'll include them in
just one example of the many decisions
you would make
about oh this study well i did say we
were going to include all the studies
even if they had flaws but
gosh i think this one is more flawed
than the other ones
so this one i'll keep out because it
isn't the kind of flaw that the other
ones have
or something so the point is
the meta-analysis is not something that
all
experts say oh yeah you got me with the
meta-analysis
some experts say i don't believe in
meta-analysis
because you had too many choices when
you decided how to do it
so it was your choices and your
assumptions
that created the outcome it wasn't the
data it was the assumptions you made
about which data to use that's all
that's all that happened
now um so there's been some back and
forth i think andres
just posted just when i was getting
going live
so he's making his point that maybe some
of brett's data
is more coincidence and that each time
you see the
the ivermectin come in and you see the
the infection rate drop that in
all or enough of those cases to
to destroy the point in all or enough of
those cases there are also
other things going on and you can't
untangle them
meaning that there's always a change in
the lockdown the weather is getting
better the vaccinations are
are pouring in our ability to do
therapeutics is better
we've vaccinated the and protected the
most vulnerable
we know we know how to treat these
things
blah blah blah blah so how do you know
it was just the ivermectin
because i don't know if this is true
but i'll bet you could look for random
variables that also
correspond so
you've got one view that says it's so
obvious in the data that maybe you don't
even need
a meta-analysis but they did one
and you've got at least one very smart
person saying
don't believe meta-analyses but
this gets back to my original point
right
apparently the data is so strong meaning
that basically
every test says that ivermectin works
do you need to do a meta-analysis
if every study shows it works how is the
meta-analysis going to show something
different
what what the hell kind of assumptions
could you make
if every study shows it works there's
nothing you could deselect
that would turn that into the wrong
answer would it
now again you need the gold standard
randomized controlled trial you need
a huge number of people to make sure
that you have enough of them
and we don't have that yet for
ivermectin
um and so here's the question
uh and here's what uh brett said on a
tweet um and he was concerned that i was
that i'm being influenced maybe in the
wrong direction on this topic
and i asked him what he thought i got
wrong and and brett responded and what i
saw
meaning watching the twitter back and
forth and maybe
maybe the live stream i'm not sure he
said in what i saw you
meaning me correctly found the
reputation hazard
issue but then allowed a credential to
back you off the increasingly obvious
pattern
would you agree with his statement did i
allow a credential
and i assume he's meaning andre's uh
backhouse
uh did i allow andre's credentials
to back me off an increasingly obvious
pattern
well i don't believe i backed off an
obvious pattern
because i never said the pattern doesn't
exist did i
i'm looking at your comments and you're
agreeing with you're agreeing with them
what does it mean to back off an obvious
pattern
define that what's the statement means
that i
i backed off an increasingly obvious
pattern
you know that doesn't mean anything
right
like you're agreeing with a statement
that is neither true nor false it
doesn't mean anything
how do you back off an obvious pattern
did did i say the pattern is not obvious
anymore
did i ever say that have i ever said
that the pattern is not
obvious the whole point of it is the
pattern is obvious
the only reason we're talking about it
is that a hundred percent of the people
who look at it say well the pattern is
obvious
the critics say the pattern is obvious
the proponents say the pattern's obvious
brett says the pattern's obvious andre
says the pattern's obvious
i say the pattern is obvious as far as i
know
the studies are very very very weighted
toward it working and each study has
some some issues
where about where have i backed off so
that's
that's my view it's never changed tell
me where i changed my view
where did i evolve where am i wrong
yeah you got a little you got pretty
 quiet didn't you
so here's my point we can't even tell
what somebody else is arguing
right you don't even know what my
 point is half the time
which is normal it's that's not a
criticism big view
it is completely normal for human beings
not to even understand the point
much less disagree with it much less
have different data
much less have a better analysis much
less have better pattern recognition
half the time you don't even know what
the i'm saying all right
and there's nothing wrong with you right
that's not a criticism in the least
same with me right it's just a thing
people don't always fully understand
what other people say
it's the most common thing in the world
so here's my
point of view uh the the pattern is
100 obvious it's never been less
than 100 obvious but
people can be fooled by obvious patterns
that's all keep that in mind let's talk
about putin and biden
apparently putin is uh putting the
screws on
on biden a little bit here um and
uh i guess uh president
putin on monday signed the law to
officially end the country's open skies
treaty with the us
so that treaty allowed us to fly over
russia and russia to fly over the u.s
to build confidence that neither was
doing things
in a big way that would be you know
militarily
aggressive or something but i don't know
if there was much value in that
because who knows can the satellites see
it all anyway
does it matter if we have an open skies
treaty does that really bias anything
because probably between the you know
the the cyber
means and satellites i feel like we can
see their and they can see our
like i don't know if that if you talk to
an expert would they say this even
mattered this treaty
but the fact that he's canceling now so
soon to when
putin and biden are going to meet it's
kind of a little slap in the face
it's a little bit telling him who's in
charge
interestingly last month i think
fox news reported this that the biden
administration
told russia that had no plans to rejoin
the arms control pact
that trump abandoned so trump had
canceled
an agreement with russia on arms control
and during the
during the election candidate biden had
said that it was short-sighted
so biden criticized trump for canceling
that deal
and now biden agrees with trump that the
deal should not be reinstated
so add this to your growing list
of times when trump was criticized for
being wrong
and has been proven right added to the
list
the list is getting pretty long the
things that trump told us
were true but the news and the democrats
had to just disagree because it was
trump
and now they're just eating their their
words so here's another example
um all right so
he's right again you know there was one
thing that i was most worried about with
this pandemic
and it you know beyond the the danger
and the economics of it
of course we're all worried about the
deaths and the economy
but one of the things i was most worried
about
is that when it was done a significant
number of the public would say it never
happened
because i could kind of see this coming
from a mile away
and when i say it never happened i mean
that there will be a substantial
amount of the public who will say as
tucker carlson did last night that it
was just a severe
seasonal flu because the death rates
were so low
how many of you would agree that now it
looks like we're seeing something like
the end of it
how many would you agree with this
shocking statement that it was not a
pandemic
really we just treated it like one and
that it was nothing more than a pretty
bad
seasonal flu how many of you agree with
that
i'm going to read off your statements
agree agree disagree
no no very bad flu i agree i agree
yes hyperbole but was way over hyped
not a pandemic yes no disagree don't
agree
no no no all right so you can see from
that
that there are plenty of people who
agree with this statement
that a pandemic didn't happen
it makes me a little crazy so here's my
context
to help you out number one
it's not a bad seasonal flu because the
regular seasonal flu
isn't real meaning the numbers that we
get every year
about people dying from the flu probably
have never been real
meaning that the real number of people
who die from the flu
is probably closer to nobody now
the real seasonal flu numbers are
collected by
statistics they just say well it looks
like more people died this season than
usual
so that must be the flu people they
don't count with flu deaths
and what about people who are old and
have the flu and then die
did they die of the flu well
i don't know they had the flu and they
were about ready to die
so the first thing you need to know is
that
there was never a thing as far as i can
tell
it could be wrong right so i'm going to
allow that i could be wrong about this
but based on what i can see so far the
regular flu
was the hoax
the regular flu this is not a bad
version of the regular flu
because the regular flu deaths were
always a hoax
they didn't exist
[Music]
and that means i'm going to have to run
really fast but let me give you this
comparison
tucker points out that 99.5 of people
under the age of 70 would survive covet
19
therefore it wasn't really a pandemic so
99.5
survive so you shouldn't be worried
about that let me ask you this what
percentage of americans
all americans died in world war ii
was world war ii a big deal anybody
anybody
was world war ii a big deal i think it
was
seems like a big deal it's in all the
history books in world war
ii how many americans died 0.3 percent
in other words as a percentage of the
whole country
fewer americans died in all of world war
ii
than died in the pandemic now if you
want to say that didn't happen
then pick a side and say yeah and world
war ii was no big deal
vietnam nothing if that's your view
support it just just tell me that the
civil war was sort of a blip
world war ii was an inconvenience and
uh you know it's about the same if
that's your view
all right i have to run i wish i could
stay but
i do have to run and i will talk to you
tomorrow
