X who has the cutting board cutting
board
view uh you'll probably all see the
cutting board but from a different
View today we're going to be making
some
doll soup or you could call it lentil
soup or stew or God knows what's going
to happen I have no idea but we're going
to have a good time I'm going to add
some potatoes to
it and we're going to figure out how to
do this
uh there's a lot of measuring
involved which is definitely not my
strong
suit I'm not not big on
measuring but I want to get my stuff
ready here I think there's three and a
half of these I if you're on locals I
posted the the recipe so you could
follow
along
sorry so B basically doll soup is
lentils onions
garlic and 700 chiny uh 700 Indian
spices and some vegetable broth and blah
blah blah so we're going to sauté the
lentils
first uh but I want to make sure I have
everything ready
to dump it in there when the sauté in's
all
ready so we got our that all right uh
question for
you uh I'm told that I need a neutral
oil to sauté this meaning no virgin
olive oil a neutral sautéing oil what
would you recommend avocado
oil or the sunflower oil and coconut oil
blend avocado avocado oh a lot of
avocado people sunflower avocado avocado
wsy
sorry so we'll prep
this uh oh it's going to be one of these
it's going to be one of these things
where you can't really figure out oh
there we
go got it and then one of these
things that will fall apart when you do
it kind of worked kind of work a little
bit all right so we got our
oil
we're going to be sautéing up here in a
minute but not until I've got my
tomatoes ready and cut some
potatoes I'm going to do those in the
how many of you have ever seen a
convection oven at work convection oven
anybody they are quite awesome for a
number of
things we've got a rice cooker back
there we'll fire that up in a minute too
but
first
every every time I do the uh The Cutting
Board cam it's the place I put down all
my objects and block their
view it was kind of hilarious last time
that was so
bad so bad all right well we're going to
cut up these
potatoes but not too much I probably
won't cut that one on the ground
now got away but we don't need to cut
them up too much because
they're pretty
awesome take a look down down there you
go but I did notice some of these have
these big black spots in them we don't
need
that do we so did all of you see what
Elon mus said about his advertisers
today
Legend he had uh some Choice
words you're trying to Blackmail me you
can go do something which is
anatomically challenging that's what he
said so he said you can go do something
anatomically
challenging I think this is
dirt can't tell
so this has nothing to do with the doll
soup but I'm going to add it to
it don't you think potatoes would go
well with doll
soup
no no no tomato no potatoes and doll
soup well maybe after 700 years of
making doll soup in India they know
exactly what goes in there and potatoes
not so
much not so
much all right well if you insist I'll
eat them
separately they use rice we'll be making
rice oh you're
funny oh you
colonizers you're
funny
how's everything doing over there you
can use potatoes oh well we're getting a
dissenting view on the potato
question you know it's kind of a
trade-off you can EI either see the
board or see my face and I'm pretty sure
you've chosen
correctly what's that doing there
you
know I feel like our
ancestors maybe would have just pop
these in their
mouths that's what they would have
done now are they eyes they don't look
like it oh you tell me the spots I cut
out do those look like eyes or
dirt eyes or dirt what do you
think
eyes eyes or
dirt eyes or
dirt I just know I'm going to eat
them I hope that's right in in the
pan all right what do you say we make
some uh we'll chop up some Tomatoes I
think you need a cup of
these
they look like Starving
Children is somebody bitching already
somebody's already
complaining do we have complainers here
today this is no no place for
complainers
we do not claim any cooking
ability only I'm just keeping you
company is that
okay Switching to knife number
two I think I need a cou of these guys
so what's that cup look
like you know honestly I think I'm going
to stop measuring and just start
throwing stuff in I'm already bored with
measuring I'm the only one here
today bored with
measuring so let's do
this
maybe maybe another one of
these an immersion
blender day before
payday that that should be a thing it
should be called day before payday
soup don't you think somebody should
call it that yep it's day before payday
soup it's basically whatever was in the
refrigerator everybody still with
me all right all right you're
there X 263 people on
x
I love the fact that the most
entertaining person onx is musk
himself that's just so perfect that he
can be his own marketing
and all he
needs that feels like
enough all right now we got to open up
some
cans how much of this coconut milk do I
need right somebody's talking about
their
length yeah he did use it perfectly the
f word coconut milk let's
see oh coconut milk one cup so I need
one of
these all right
then all right
then you're going to have to relocate
for a
minute okay X you can be over
here cover your
ears coming with a heavy
[Applause]
[Music]
equipment
all right the
hell is is milk supposed to be a
solid it
is
exactly I knew
that totally knew
that all right we're going to put in
some
oil I'll give you the sauté view a
little in a little bit
carefully measured
oil then we've got onions oh we've got
to do this
first I believe I have a uh garlic
press sorry X
sorry believe I have a garlic press I'm
off to find the garlic
press and I would put it in
in this
drawer if I were that garlic
press
yes garlic press in the
house wig of coffee important
ingredient well today the garlic is
precut um but where is
it okay oh here it
is and
then the all important kitchen
scissors I don't know how much garlic we
need what do you think 25 cloves would
that be enough
watch watch me not remember how this
works it goes in
there
y let's let's be
neat now how satisfying is
this
is that
satisfying then I like to put the next
one in before the other one's fully
squeezed
out it's like teaching it a lesson it's
like you were supposed to get all the
way out
no
no a little bit more
yeah
is no company coming tonight so
there we
go all
right so we got our garlic
ready
and I know you think that's enough you
don't know how much I'm making
like you could
tell all right I'm going to turn on the
sauté
situation I've already I've already uh
wash the
lentils red
lentils so step number
one get the rice
cooking
Rex you can
watch all right you can all see oh yes
you
[Music]
go
but this time I'll will actually wash
the
rice

rice washing the
rice so much
better that's some good rice I like this
sound then
two cups of
[Applause]
water
then boom and that's rice all right I'm
going to take you over to the sautéing
area
that
setup that's a setup right
there all right X you can be over
there it's not going to be a good view
for you but that's all I can do for
now
all right uh let's see onions go in here
first we got some diced
onions yeah garlic
glass correcto put a bunch of onions in
there I don't have any
onions but I like onion
so we'll do a
bunch
so I think I'm going to do
Sriracha what do you

or wait what goes in
next chopped
onions then garlic and ginger
Ginger I get my Ginger
ready
Ginger
oh oh God is it going to be one of
these one of these unopen
bles might need
pliers I need
pliers you be very
unhappy

I'm actually going to need a
tool to open
this
oh
really can't break
in wait something's moving
got
it
no don't have
time oh God there's another
layer sh prepped prepped God damn
it
ah

good
now think we're almost
translucent what do you
think uh
ltil
[Music]
sa pour in the vegetable broth
when do you put in the tomatoes the
coconut milk and straighten
Tomatoes all right looks like we're
ready for a
[Music]
garlic we're ready
for
ginger I hope it calls for a lot of
Ginger
now it's Len all
time L My People
Go Oh stick together if you do that
apparently for me cooking and the salt
are largely the
same that's very
inconvenient
some of this in
there there we
go now it's all
working hold
on the lentils once washed Harden into a
concrete like
substance which I'm now
rectifying that's called
resourcefulness all
right probably need a lot more of
that
one of my pep peaves is when the
uh when it doesn't of 32
oz how many cups in 32
o four
cups
probably that's four cups oh that well
wow I
guess that the exact amount that's
pretty luy
all
right cook
covered
great Alexa set timer for eight
minutes then we do coconut milk and
tomatoes
they still haven't put any of the
regular seasons I
me okay there's no step where you put
any of the seasons
in You' expect to see
that oh last add the spices and saut all
right the spices should already be in
there but it's not too late add them now
is anybody watching
this looks like medium
heat yeah it's low heat
now all right one
teaspoon
coriander now hold
on
turmeric ginger
oh I have way too much Ginger but that's
okay
[Applause]
turmeric termeric is
next there one
teaspoon that's one
tablespoon one
teaspoon may you
teaspoon oh no
tablespoons damn it
okay what's
in cumin what are you in for
cumin talk to me cumin one
tablespoon one tablespoon of
cumin where are you one tablespoon of
cumin that's a teaspoon I mean teaspoon
not
tablespoon one
teaspoon God if only that would fit that
would be so
cool red paprika
powder should probably stir that in
starting to look
delicious starting to look like I have
too many
onions you're you're actually finding
this
entertaining
surprised why are none of these big
enough nope we
go
Curry now the
curry every time I cook I think to
myself I'm never going to do this again
why would I ever
cook
crazy
czy all right that's the good stuff
there and
uh try red lentils what ual broth
coconut milk after all
right looks like the spices have been
added now it's time you got time to lean
you got time to
clean
see if I can get the right Tops on
these
gri it is trash night thank
you should I put it in earlier I think
you're right should have put it in
earlier
I have a cooking robot now I need a
cooking
robot so
much oh no got the wrong Tops on the
wrong things
now all right I'm going to change your
view a little
bit
Ah that's hey that's
better yeah I always put a paper bag
coated with butter on the inside the
hell are you talking
about
oh should I add
Sriracha you see no no no so how do you
get it hot I also have chili
oil chili
oil chili
oil
cayen only cayenne
pepper do I have Cayenne Pepper or is it
Cayenne you have how about
that no cayenne
pepper taste the first come
on what do you think I
am I look like a
taster
I'm not going to lie this this really
looks like it's going to be
good it looks like it's going to be
really
good
maybe all
right again it
is I believe there's a little salt and
pepper that needs to go going here
too if I
recall salt and
pepper you know how much is the right
amount of
Pepper too much too much is the right
amount oh looking
good looking
good ghost
pepper did I set my
alarm I think it did all
right I got these in here now if you
want to see
how convection oven
works
Alexa
cancel well I think this is when you put
in the other stuff
right like the coconut milk and the
tomatoes and
whatnot I got po
holders all right so we cooked them and
now add the coconut milk and strained
tomatoes in five more
minutes
how much of
this coconut milk one
cup one cup of coconut
milk oh that there you go one cup
exactly and then we add in our
Tomatoes sorry sorry
X we're back to this
we get all that in
there already put in the salt
and how many of you are so nerdy on
locals that you actually check the
recipe and you're following along with
the
recipe how many are actually following
the recipe that I I posted up
there I knew I knew somebody
would all right well that's a lot of
coconut
o
um now I'm supposed to have an a uh
yogurt
garnish think that's necessary I don't
know it's
optional optional all right I was going
to make
some make some potatoes in the
meantime in my convection
oven so we're going to speed cook we're
going to go to
potatoes which is actually listed
potatoes we look through the
potatoes not
that H not a bit well they're like baked
potatoes they're
small super small like one potato
worth
four minutes it
says we'll find
out all
right how we done how are we doing so
far but we're still in family
hour
what about the
yogurt yeah it's using the presentation
that is correct it's not it's not an
ingredient per se it's a
garnish incidentally gardish sounds like
an Indian
word I call it the
Gish
a little
mango if if V were here he'd have you
order door Dash he probably
would uh I washed them I didn't soak
them
R you're so drunk good for
you you know I don't want to make this
about fashion but I feel like I feel
like this apron is more fashionable than
the white
one I feel this onsal goes together
pretty
good
it look like had
Dexter yeah it's sort of a Santa's elf
sort of a look
uh I feel like this needs to
get needs to get stirred
again it really
doesn't but it gives me that feeling
yeah looks like it was a little heavy on
the
coconut but I think it's going to settle
in pretty
nicely I say it's looking
perfect still a little runny use a few
minutes did I use the whole coconut
seemed like
it it needs to be a little
drier just a little
bit I'm going to move you a little bit
closer
oh way better way
better I'm not happy you said which one
are you I got
it to grow shs okay just looking at your
comments well waiting for the cooking to
be
perfect can't see the lentils
anymore I don't know if it's a
metaphor all right did anybody learn
anything is there anybody here who was
thinking I might try to make some of
that lentil
stuff no probably
not
nobody not a single
person not not even
one all right looks like our uh
rice is ready and to
Perfection oh
yeah be right
back rice is perfect
two thumbs up if you don't know why I'm
doing this um on the other platforms on
the locals it uh reads your thumbs if
you have two thumbs up it goes into
fireworks which is very cool I've got
fireworks going behind me
now I don't think I'll ever get time
tired of that it's kind of
cool I'll let you see on uh on
x wait oh I can't do it now because I
can't do both
thumbs you do one
thumb all right well this isn't good
demonstration I need an extra
thumb sort of I need one more opposable
thumb story my life you know if I just
had one more opposable
thumb things would be going a lot better
for me so we're going to be putting
stuff
away because because we
must do the
fireworks still ready to
be nice we're in a family
hour well didn't say to soak
them they look plenty
soft all right well it looks like
probably I needed a lot more it's more
like a goulash than a
soup that's
fine I think it's
done I think
my potatoes are
done here's where you try not to kill
yourself because let me tell you that's
going to be hot
hot these are literally hot
potatoes
right
now well what do you think should I
should I try
it you ready for the taste test taste
test
first some
rice right put it we'll put down a
little little B of
rice
then tell you it's certainly got a
smell put some of that on there
okay this might be terrible
actually then we garnish
it
then we
dare
we dare to taste
it we
dare no
no actually the the flavor is actually
uh
excellent uh but the the lentils are too
soft overcooked so they're actually
overcooked
but they're really really tasty if you
look at it as a gravy it works really
well all right this is my cooking show
for the day I'm going to eat a little
bit more of
it if you're on the local network
there's a good chance that I might be
back or something that we don't call
cooking well it's kind of
cooking so thanks for joining YouTube
uh I hope you can cook better than I can
bye for
now
