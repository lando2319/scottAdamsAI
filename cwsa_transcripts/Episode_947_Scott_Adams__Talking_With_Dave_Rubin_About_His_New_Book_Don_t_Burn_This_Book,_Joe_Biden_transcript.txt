hey everybody
come on in this might be the best
coffee with scott adams of all time
yes i'm going to be talking to a very
special guest if our technology works
we'll have dave reuben on here to talk
about his book
but that doesn't happen until we do the
important stuff first and you know what
i mean
you know what i mean it involves a
little thing called the simultaneous sip
it's famous all over the world it's a i
would call it a worldwide event
possibly possibly more than worldwide
you never know but let's do this
simultaneous
sip and then we're going to talk to dave
and all you need
um to begin do you know what you need
you know what you need right
yeah you need a copper mug or a glass
attacker jealous or stein i can't think
of a flask of vessel of any kind
to fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better including the damn
pandemic
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
go
sublime well let's see if our technology
is working uh
it is dave has showed up exactly at the
right
time and exactly the right place and if
everything works the gods of technology
will allow me to say hi to dave rubin
dave are you there
dave dave
dave i can hear some noise but i don't
hear your voice are you talking
unmute unmute unmute your phone
if it's muted
well dave you are connected but i am not
hearing your voice
so there might have you might have a
microphone problem
on your device or possibly
um something else
so you should be on a mobile device dave
and you should be talking to me right
now i'll bet you can hear me
but i can't hear you but i do hear
something
all right i see that you disappeared and
you'll probably be coming back in
one moment here would be my guess
yeah i'll look up there is
probably back on a different devices my
guess
dave can you hear me yay
all right i did have the simultaneous
sip with you
good because i could feel the vibes all
the way from here
now uh i have your book which i'm
holding up so the audience can see
don't burn this book hey now was this
your first book
this is my first book so as a guy that's
written like
800 books i i now understand why there's
not a header on your head
because it takes work
very different than just sitting up from
somebody and entering them or talking to
the camera i mean there's a discipline
involved in a book that
that i actually didn't realize i was
going to enjoy but ended up really
learning a lot about myself i think just
through going through the slog of it you
know
yeah and then you get to the uh the
promoting part and you find out that's
harder than writing the book
and you say what what i didn't realize i
was going to be getting up at
god-awful times and talking to people
all over the world
so let's jump right into a few things
i i finished your book this morning i
enjoyed the heck out of it i really
especially liked your personal journey
and
we'll talk about some of these things
but but i have to i have to point this
out
you know you've got a good book when you
look at the reviews on amazon
and there are no two three and four star
reviews you have none
yeah you have none it's all ones and
fives
yeah it's all ones and fives and the
ones are you know you go to the ones
because you want to see
what the haters are all about and it's
obviously just people who
um you know stuck in their little bubble
and they're just angry at you
because you you have a different opinion
so the ones are really just about
how they feel about themselves or
something yeah
well it's funny because so you're
totally right all we're getting are
we're getting mostly fives and then
we're getting this you know burst of
ones and it has nothing you know these
are obviously people who didn't read the
book they don't comment on anything
in the book it's mostly just they don't
like me which is fine but
it's it's funny because as you know i i
toured with jordan peterson and every
time i read one of those ones
i think man these people just need to
read 12 rules for life because
they're not they're not really saying
anything about me they're saying far
more about themselves and their own
sort of their own sort of internal chaos
and and lack of worth or something but
it's fine i mean this is the internet
you know there's something going on and
i should
emphasize this overwhelmingly five star
reviews i just think it's funny
because the same thing the same thing
happens to me as soon as i put a book
out all the people who hate me for
something completely unrelated to the
book
store storm into the reviews to put
finally
finally i've got him he can't go
anywhere people are going to read these
reviews
all right so um i especially liked your
uh your story of your journey because
they had these little turning points
that all had these
these interesting stories so you could
really see your
you know your evolution and one of them
struck me because you and i uh had a
date
in common that something happened
what happened to me was uh i was
promoting one of my books
and it came out on a week that something
else happened
it was called 9 11. and
needless to say 9 11 was not a good week
to promote a book that wasn't about 9 11
so that didn't work out
now something happened the day before 9
11 in
in your life's journey to tell us that
quick story
yeah so i'm 43 years old i was born in
76 which i guess is starting to sound
old especially to these zoomers uh but i
was 25 at the time
and i had been closeted about my
sexuality really my
my whole life or at least you know into
my 20s when i started sort of realizing
where i was which i know is very
late in life people find it hard to
believe especially young people now
because kids
come out at you know 13 14. it's not
it's not thought of as a problem or
something that's
evil or broke about them but you know i
was a child of the 80s it was just a
different
thing and uh and i would say it's sort
of just an inside job you know
people people go how could you be
closeted for so long it's just
life is weird you know it is it just is
and i think the other thing i get into
this a little bit is
that you know because i don't seem
stereotypically gay i never felt gay per
se like i thought gabe meant
oh you like the theater you like to
dance all this other stuff and
you know the type of things that i like
because you you've been in my house many
times i like basketball i like video
games i like things like that in any
event
i had never come out to anybody and then
literally
at about 12 30 a.m on
september 11th 2001. so this is now
about seven hours before the attack
um i was in the times square subway
station which i'm sure many people
watching this have been to
standing by the the shuttle train which
i'm sure as you know all it does is go
from grand central
to times square back and forth so you
sort of feel like you're in purgatory
over there
and i was with my friend mike who was a
comedian who
was uh openly gay and we'd become
friends over the past year
and i i said i told him i was gay and
he sort of didn't realize that he was
like my big coming out so he was like oh
well that's great you know i'll see you
tomorrow and
he walked away and i thought you know in
my mind i had just sort of
released this you know evil horrific
damaging secret into the world
and then i woke up the next morning and
to a phone call from my dad and he he
worked in manhattan and he could see the
the twin towers and he actually uh he
called me between
the first and second one so he ended up
seeing the second one hit but he had
already seen the first one hit
and i know it sounds crazy and i and i
do write about this but i
genuinely thought it had something to do
with me
that uh which is that just says so much
but yeah
i got struck back but struck back at my
own my own city where i lived i lived in
new york city at the time my dad was
as i said was right there my grandma
lived in the city
um and that did serious psychological
damage to me it sounds crazy to talk
about but it really did
you know the the part of the story that
i was relating to that i
thought was the funniest is that this
was like the biggest thing in your life
i imagine based on the way you tell the
story
and the first thing the first person you
tell is sort of like ho-hum
and then there's and then the next day
is 9 11 and suddenly your little problem
didn't mean anything
yeah it didn't mean anything in a way
that i guess sort of helped because you
know obviously we don't have to go too
far into
into 9 11 but you know i had ended up
people got trapped in the city i had
friends
that walked from wall street i lived on
the upper east 90th and first i mean
that's a heck of a walk
i had friends that ended up staying with
me my dad couldn't get out of the city
he stayed with my grandma all that so it
did get my mind off it in a certain way
but i had this you know when you just
have these thoughts behind you
and the thought behind me was my god i i
just
said something and the freaking world
started imploding um
and that really tells you a lot about
the closet because when you're when
you're alone in your thoughts
anything's possible you know like you
can make up almost anything
yeah um um so i have to ask you this
question i've always been curious about
this
but uh you and i have a similar
experience uh not in the coming out of
the closet part but in the
um the being among the conservatives
more than the liberals but not really
feeling like you have all the same
opinions as them and i found
that conservatives are far more
open-minded
yeah than the left and but
as long as you meet these conditions
you must treat them respectfully even if
you disagree
that's just you know that has to happen
secondly if you follow the constitution
meaning you buy into the the principles
i
found that every conservative will
accept you completely
as long as you're living an honest life
you're and you're compatible with the
constitution they're pretty much good
are you finding that the left is
harder on you than the right oh for sure
and i you know in some ways
to get to the second part of that first
i don't blame the left for being harder
harder on me than the right is i don't
blame them for that in that i am much
harder on the left
but the reasoning the reasoning for that
though is exactly what you just said
there i mean i have found look
you know i know you do it every now and
again too where you'll sort of lay out
your lefty cred
i mean look i'm gay married that's
supposed to be a sort of lefty issue i
am
pro-choice and i write about it in the
book i am against the death penalty i'm
for some level of public education i'm
for euthanasia
there's a series of like big things that
are that i believe in that are supposed
to be lefty issues
but i get literally nothing but hate
from the left
and i get nothing but love from the
right so think about it think about the
abortion one i mean that's the one
for i'm actually not totally sure your
opinion on abortion i'd be happy to hear
it
but that's the one for the people on the
right that's like the biggest
no-no like you have to be pro-life and
yet
all of the people who i now consider my
allies who
who have promoted the hell out of my
book and treat me well all the time from
shapiro to prager to beck i was on laura
ingram last night tucker carlson
dana perino gutfeld all of these people
we have all these political differences
we talk about them on air i mean i go on
i go on tucker and i talk to him about
why he's about
about getting the government involved in
big tech and i think you and i might
even have a little
difference of opinion there but it's
like yes you're right
if you treat them respectfully there's
an understanding that
we want to live in a country with people
with different opinions
and if you believe in the constitution
and basically the idea
that we should all have equal rights and
that doesn't mean we're all gonna
we're all gonna make it and it's gonna
be perfect for everybody
but that's the best the society can do
so that's been i think
the the craziest shift for me that i
went from being a lefty
and then all i did was say oh you know
these uh these conservatives aren't that
bad
and i realized maybe they were the good
guys the whole time which is
which is a really weird thing that i
think a lot of young people are starting
to realize
yeah i'm not sure i see it as good guys
or bad guys i just know who's more
willing to
accept me and i just feel more more
comfortable and people are
willing to say i totally disagree with
that but you're okay
yeah well i think there's a reason for
that you know i think there's actually a
fundamental reason for that which is
that if you're a conservative
or someone on the right libertarian you
know something like that
you believe in individual rights like
that's a fundamental
constitutional precept you believe that
everyone should have equal rights
regardless of any of the
immutable characteristics and on the
left unfortunately i don't know what the
unifying principle is anymore the
unifying principle really seems to be
just government
well you know i've got a theory which is
that people on the left have been
bullied or or they they they feel
victims and maybe there's something in
their life that you know led them to
that decision
because i think they're triggered by
people like trump who
because he just has a bully vibe so
let me ask you this were you were you
ever bullied as a kid is that
is that a big part of i mean everybody
was right but was it a big part of your
experience or do you think you
got through it okay you know what scott
i'll show you that i'm not a virtue
signaler here
i was as much a bully as i was believed
that is that is the truth i was 50 50. i
always describe it with my friends like
when i think of junior high in high
school
it's not that i was a bully i was also
not i didn't really have a growth spurt
until
really into college so i was kind of on
the small side of things but
i was i was i remember one day in around
eighth grade
thinking you know right now i could be
one of the popular kids
or i could be a not popular kid i really
remember that and i remember thinking
i just don't want to put in the work to
be a popular kid like i like
like it would be work i'd have to dress
differently and get a different haircut
and all of that stuff and i liked my
friends
we played video games all night we
played basketball all day i
do not i never even had a sip of alcohol
in high school the first beer i ever had
was at high school graduation i had a
sip of a coors light out of a can and i
hated it
um but but in terms of bullying so i was
kind of like i got bullied by the kids
that were more popular than me and
sometimes i bullied the kids that were
less popular than me
it just is i know that you know yet to
feel like a proud human
a proud adult you have to say you were
bullied all the time you were bullied
relentlessly
and that makes you good now but the
truth is it was it was really 50 50 for
me
all right so uh i i the other parts of
your story that i found fascinating is i
didn't realize that you
interned for the daily show when you
were really young
yeah you know it's funny it's hard for
people to remember
what that was like because you know the
daily show at least for the jon stewart
daily show was like this
just sort of um it was this everything
like it started becoming this thing
where you know everybody said that this
is where young people get the news and
it was like this endlessly
sort of cool thing that everyone wanted
to be part of and all that
and i interned there right when jon
stewart took over
so this was in the fall of 99 going into
2000
and john had just taken over and do you
remember craig kilbourne was the host of
the show before that he was a sports
center anchor who i loved
absolutely loved but he was a real like
sort it was all about him and john
obviously was very self-deprecating
so it was a bit of an odd time to be
there because people were getting fired
left and right because you know they
were
turning over the staff and everything
and it wasn't like the popular daily
show that everyone came to know
um on a side note about the daily show
now it's like since trevor noah took
over
that show is just beyond irrelevant i
mean
it's almost and it's almost like you're
not allowed to talk about it because it
makes it
you know they'll call you a racist if
you say it but nobody but
literally nobody watches it and for some
reason that doesn't get written about
anywhere
so so let me ask you this i have a
theory that people who become successful
uh in you know in their adult life often
had brushes with other successful people
when they were when they were young
enough to be uh impressionable
and it gives you a sense that you could
do it too because you you realize these
famous people are actually just normal
now did you have that experience the
famous people were normal and you said
hey i could do this
yeah you know actually we cut out
there's only one chapter of the book
that we cut out and that's where i go
into a little more of my life in new
york city as a stand-up
and the struggles around that i talk
about it a little bit
but one of the things that i cut out um
which is related to the daily show
is right before my internship ended so i
would intern in the city three days a
week i lived with my parents in long
island
and i don't want to brag but on my two
days off i was a part-time video game
salesman at electronics boutique
in the garden city mall um but right
before the internship ended i went up to
jon stewart at a party
and i said i'd only met him once or
twice throughout the whole thing you
know he's the big star i'm the intern so
it's not like we're like sitting down
all the time
but i wanted to make sure i said
something to him before the internship
ended i said
um i said john can you just give me one
piece of advice about stand-up
and without pausing without any
hesitation he looked at me right in the
eye
and he goes don't stop and
to me it encapsulated everything that
stand up sort of is like stand up
sucks like the not not the being on
stage but you know standing out on
street corners hand out tickets
performing in front of three people at 2
a.m all of that and just this
the fact that he said don't stop when
every comic
no matter how bad it gets it's like you
just got to keep going keep going keep
going keep going and
and i know plenty of guys i i can tell
you this for sure and i'm sure you've
seen your version of this
the best comics that i knew most of them
disappeared
and and in many cases it was the worst
ones who survived because
they didn't even know they were supposed
to stop and and
and i think that he just planted that
seed within me that you know
that the only way you make it is if you
don't stop and i think that got in there
and then over the years i
started meeting a lot of people that
were my heroes on the upper west i i
lived a block away from jerry seinfeld
i used to bump into him on the street
often and have some exchanges and i got
to meet richard lewis and a whole bunch
of other comedians
that you start seeing them as humans and
then you're like well i'm a human too
and if they can do it
maybe i can do it yeah i i feel like
that's a big part of a lot of people's
stories
and that it's just so automatic that you
have that association with them
and it changes you now you had yet
another uh
story here about uh the being on the
young turks which i i didn't realize
until i read it in your book that you
were on the young turks for a short
period
and uh that was where you sort of
accidentally got red pill that sounded
like
you know if you go into the belly of the
beast you might find something that can
repel you basically yeah
i lay out i lay out three stories there
but sort of briefly
you know when i got there i always
considered myself a new york liberal
what i mean by that is sort of like a
jfk ask not what your country can do for
you ask what you can do for your country
you know
uh daniel patrick moynihan ed koch that
there were there used to be good
decent liberals and something sort of
happened about five years ago where the
progressives came in
and they started screaming about
everything and they were angry and i
think you are right it was maybe because
they were bullied so that they started
bullying i think there's something there
and you know after about a year there it
started to wear thin on me because i
suddenly thought this can't be right it
can't be right
that we're so morally right we're so
good
and and everyone who we oppose is evil
and a racist and a bigot and and the
rest of it and
you know i tell the story in the book
about how i was on air with them
and they were showing a clip of david
webb who's a conservative commentator on
fox news
and he happens to be black and they're
going on and on about how he's a sellout
and he's an uncle tom and all of this
stuff
and what they didn't know was i had a
show on siriusxm years before
and i had become good friends with david
webb i was a lefty he was on the right
but we used to talk it out on air all
the time
and i knew that not only was he a good
man but he believes what he says
and here they are the quote-unquote
tolerant lefties who see a black man who
behaves differently than they want black
men to behave
and then they're allowed to call him all
the worst things in the book and that's
when i realized that that was just a new
what i would say is sort of like an
insidious or pernicious racism it's not
it's not overt
you can't go to the water fountain you
know it's something much more dangerous
in a way
now this is uh you've probably heard of
the gel
man uh idea gel man was a physicist who
said
uh that if you if you read the news for
a story that you actually know the facts
you see it's all fake but then you re
you read the very next story that you
don't know anything about
and you accept it as true even though
everyone that you know about is fake so
was this your first experience
seeing that the news was fake because
you actually knew the the real story
well not only did i know the real story
then i knew the people who were
delivering the news
so that sort of doubled it as well and
you know
one of the things that i do in the book
is lay out what i think are four types
of fake news and what i find to be the
most dangerous one of them
is the one that we're really really
seeing right now you know people think
fake news is just oh a fake headline
and then and you know just like a
made-up story or a headline that doesn't
match the story
but what i think the most dangerous one
is is what we're seeing with biden right
now which is that
we all heard about any any of us right
scott work we're creatures of the
internet and twitter and youtube
it's like we've all been hearing about
this tara reid stuff for probably two
months
and it wasn't it wasn't until literally
last saturday
so i believe it was five days ago or so
that um cnn finally talked about it
and then apparently this morning i guess
msnbc talked about it
but it's like that's a type of fake news
when they intentionally ignore a story
because it goes against their narrative
that's fake and we know that's clearly
not what they did with kavanaugh so i
think
knowing some of the tips i mean i think
you're probably one of the best
communicators on this kind of stuff
of like getting people to understand
like the basic framework for the
nonsense because we really need it these
days
yeah one of the things that made me
laugh out loud just your your tips for
recognizing fake news there's one of
them there that should never have to be
said but the fact that it had to be said
made me laugh which is to check the
story to see if it matches the headline
yeah and i thought you know you if you
didn't know
that that happens all the time like it's
just the most common thing
that the story doesn't match the
headline you the first time you'd read
that you say come on
how how often i mean really dave how
often does that happen did that happen
once in your general no it's like a
common thing every week
not only is it a common thing but you
know because of twitter and the way we
all ingest news
it's an intentional it's an intentional
shell game you know
they know that that probably i would
guess
i'd love to see some numbers on this but
i'm guessing that something like 90
percent of the people
only look at the headline and they know
they know that they can play that game
yeah you had another tip for funding
fake news that
i i do a version of this you said if it
looks too good to be true
i i say if it's too on the nose in other
words
it says the same thing it's it's it's
exactly what you'd expect
your critics would expect from you
basically it's like it's just too
perfectly the narrative
and you see this so often uh when i was
listening to the
uh the latest story about the president
was mad at brad parscale and yelled at
him on the phone
and was going to sue him as if that made
sense
and then of course it took 24 hours for
the president to say no none of that
happened
yeah it's it's just endless all of this
stuff you know the jesse
one is the is the perfect example of
that one it fit what every blue check
journalist and what every progressive
that was at the time running for
president from
cory booker and and uh kamala harris and
then you know
leaked to pelosi and schumer it fit
their narrative perfectly you know this
black gay man assaulted and it's mega
country and he's got a noose and the
whole thing
and it's like of course i purposely
didn't tweet about it for those first
couple days because i was like
there is this is way too
storybook for the whole thing and then
of course what happens it's all a lie
right and then the close cousin of that
one is uh this scott alexander a
uh famous blogger said this that if
there's something that's
too hard to believe it probably didn't
happen
it's like yeah you know and there was a
conservative who you know
ate a liberal for dinner and something
you say you know
just on the surface i'm gonna say that
probably didn't happen then he waited 24
hours
and didn't happen so then uh sort of
bookending your
journey which which i found fascinating
uh really the whole the whole way
just watching your uh you know a good
movie script
this is like the script read it script
writer's trick
is that it's a journey of the star the
star starts out in a certain way
and then you watch their arc as they
they learn and become a different person
in the end
and you naturally have that in your
story so i made that just made it
come to life but i love the part where
you met your mentor
yeah um let's say that give us give us
the quick version of that
yeah well it's absolutely true when i
write in the book i was doing a show
with jordan
and jordan peterson and ben shapiro here
and that night he was doing his first
tour show so it's sort of hard to
remember because this is over two years
ago now
you know we all think of jordan like
this sort of jesus character or just
that he was always this like massive
you know intellectual rock star but he
was doing his first
test show a theater show here at the
orpheum in la that night
and i finished up the show with him and
ben and and really as a joke it was more
like it was just like a passing comment
i was like hey you know if you want me
to come down with you tonight and and
warm up the crowd i'll tell a couple
lobster jokes and you know we'll see
what happens
and without missing a beat he's like
yeah let's do it i'll see you there
and i went and and i think really this
this moment that i'm about to tell you i
think was the moment that actually like
sort of gave me the confidence to do
everything that's happened over the last
couple years
there's about 3 000 people there i've
never done you know i've done stand up
for hundreds of people but never
done something for that many people
nobody knew i was going to be there
obviously because it was it was our
little secret
and when the pa announcer he said and
now welcome the host of the reuben
report dave rubin
and the crowd went completely insane
and i remember walking on stage and i
was like i was like this can't be real
like
how did this happen i i do a youtube
show out of my garage
like how did this happen and and i
crushed it on stage
and you know i just made all the silly
jokes about jordan he sounds like hermit
the frog and all this stuff
but all this insider stuff that people
want to laugh about because you know a
lot of his stuff obviously is sort of
fire and brimstone and
and serious stuff and immediately the
the agents at caa were there they're
like listen
this thing's success we're sending him
on tour we want you to go
i was like yeah let's do it let's do it
let's do it
and and then we toured we did about 120
stops in about 20 countries
and i'll tell you this the the most i
mean i can tell you a million amazing
things about him but
the man literally gave a different
speech every single night i
never saw him give the same speech twice
which is off the charts insane
and and that and that he lived those 12
rules you know i tell a couple stories
about it in the book
but i he was always kind to people no
matter how tired he was no matter what
time it was
no matter how many hands he had to shake
like he really lived up to it to the
best way that i think
any human being could do and i think i
just through osmosis it wasn't like we
didn't have like a jedi padawan learner
relationship where it was like he was
sitting me down to teach me things
it was just being around that and being
around someone
genuinely changing the world for the
better i remember thinking in the middle
of it i was like if i walk out of this
thing and i'm not better if i'm not
dealing with my demons better whatever's
left
then that says more about me than it
says about him and i'm truly better
since then
yeah i like the fact that he has sort of
a structure
of you know this is the way to approach
life the way to look at it even if you
disagree
it always helps to start with something
yeah it's got a structure that's it
and most people don't by the way that's
why that's why his message has resonated
i think especially with young men but
really with everybody
is that something happened in the last
10 years or so
where just the basic structure of what
the foundation of what young people need
to sort of flourish just kind of
disintegrated
but i i feel i feel like he and to some
extent i feel like i'm filling this
that role by accident yeah which is
there's a whole bunch of younger people
who didn't have
a father figure that did the things you
think of father figure should do
sort of give you your code of life you
know give you your structure and stuff
you know we're a lot of people were
raised as like free-range chickens i
think
they just sort of had to figure it out
on their own and found out that that's
not easy
it's hard to figure out life on your own
so having somebody who can say look
you don't have to accept this but here's
a bunch of rules that hang together
pretty well
you know it could be could be
christianity that could be a set of
rules
it could be jordan peterson and they're
not incompatible you could be another
set of rules
and the reaction that i get is
so you know a small small compared to
jordan peterson
but the number of people who say uh i'm
just not getting this kind of
view of the world anywhere else didn't
come from my father
i don't know what books i'm going to get
it from but jordan peterson delivers it
i'll tell you this i mean i've told you
this in person i've told you this on the
show before
um so you won't even have to say it
about yourself but you were you were one
of those people that
helped me make a little sense of the
world when that when the trump thing
started happening
and i was trying to find somebody who
you know who was an established person
who could talk about trump you know not
just a random twitter person
and then i came across you and obviously
i knew dilbert but then i started
reading what you were saying and then i
interviewed you and you you weren't
crazy you were just trying to make
sense of the world as it is not as you
wanted it to be or
or that you were pretending that he was
some sort of god king or something like
that
and i think that actually was one of the
reasons that when the election rolled
around i was on joe rogan's show the day
the day before the election and i was
like yeah trump might win
because even though everybody was saying
he couldn't i was i had listened to you
i
had cernevich on and i and i sort of
tasted what was happening online
and if you do all that you can sort of
understand the way people think so i i
wasn't shocked because of that
have you noticed uh i think you and i
know a lot of the same people who's
doing a lot of the same stuff
but there's a certain set of people that
no matter which side they're on they're
at least
capable of looking at every situation
individually
so so no matter what you think of let's
say bill maher
sam harris joe rogan mike cernovich
just to name a few i'll put you in that
category and i put me in that category
which is we're at least willing to look
at each situation
without a political filter first it's
like okay does that make sense
is this good for people is it good for
me is it a system that would work in the
long run
you know and then and then somebody will
have to come along later and tell me
which side i'm on
yeah right they'll tell you if you're
far left or far right after you do it
yeah i mean i think i think the truth
about that is that what we're
trying to do here you know i'm really
not rooting for a side per se i i even
always say to people now it's like
look the conservative side and the right
the sort of center right is
way better than the left right now but
that could turn
right these things are cyclical let's
not forget it was only 20 years ago
that joe lieberman and john mccain who
were republicans were attacking mortal
kombat violence in video games and
wanted them banned from stores i was
literally a video game salesman at the
time you know like
so it's it's not that the right has some
like you know total ownership on decency
and openness
that being said at the moment there seem
to be people who are literally
libertarian-minded who are embracing oh
some things can be right some things
could be left and you can
try to make some sense of it if if
you're a decent person
and that's also why i find the
permanently political people i think
you've talked about this a little bit
too
the people that are permanently
political if you look at their twitter
feed can only tweet about the world
through politics
i find them to be the most boring people
because
if you only view the world through
politics through that lens
it can only lead you to misery politics
is a is a miserable game we can all
enjoy it we can
enjoy the wwe cafe version of it now
with trump and the pelosi and these
cartoon characters
but politics in and of itself it's about
controlling people that's not a that's
not a really fun
game for a you know a happy life
yes uh so let me uh let me wrap up here
and then i will
let you go because i know you've got the
busiest few weeks in in the world
haven't
have you been on these promotional tours
so the name of the book
is don't burn this book dave rubin
and uh you can buy this everywhere fine
books are sold it's already out
and i saw it was number one in one of
its categories on amazon
that's always good was it political yeah
we
hit political we did political thought
we did liberalism
conservatism political freedom um so
yeah so it's doing well hey scott i just
want to say
say one other thing you know when you i
found out this week that when you
release a book
um it's probably like doing anything
else sort of high profile that you
suddenly find out who your friends are
and the amount of people former guests
and things um
that have reached out and promoted the
book and you know said nice things about
me publicly and all that and obviously i
include you in
in that you and you invited me to do
this and you join locals this week which
is
freaking fantastic and we i'll have you
on again to to talk about that
but i you really do find out who your
friends are because i've had a certain
set of people that have totally
now embraced me and tried to help me
here and i've had other people who i
think people would be shocked to find
out
you know didn't say a word haven't even
just couldn't even choke out a tweet
and you know it's kind of disappointing
to to that point let me see if you found
this
uh this correlation my my
impression of the world is that uh
republicans and conservatives
are more willing to offer to help than
the left just in your career your life
you need some help
they just don't like it if you ask them
that seems to be the difference
it's like don't don't ask for my money
like
i'm not cool with that you know go get
go get your own money
but if i see that you need a boost if
there's something i can do
i can introduce you to somebody you can
meet a friend maybe you need some
funding
little advice don't you find that the
conservatives are
are so free with that yes i i absolutely
do find that and again it's it's
weird and that's partly what my book is
about that you know
if you come from the left and it's not
just that you have to wake up to what
some of the bad ideas are
you also have to recalibrate that the
people that you thought were wrong the
people that you might have thought were
bad or evil as i said before which is
obviously a bit much but but a lot of
people
on the left do think the people on the
right are evil and vice versa then you
have to recalibrate all of those things
and then suddenly it's like
like why am i having dennis prager and
his wife over for dinner while people
will say he's a homophobe and i'm having
and i'm a self-hated gay why is laura
ingram putting on her show last night
when she knows i'm pro-choice i mean
these people you can't tell me these
these are the bad guys so there is an
interesting dynamic and i and i look
forward to continuing it with you and
truly i'm thrilled you're on locals and
i think you're going to crush it on
there
and we're going to fix the internet as
much as we can dave i talk about locals
quite a bit
separately and i'll be talking about
that some more so they my
my uh audience knows what that's all
about and i send them there
thanks so much for taking the time i'm
gonna let you go to your day and i'll
stay on here and and talk about some
some events of the day thank you thanks
so much my friend
be good all right bye-bye all right
that was fun um so
check out his book don't burn this book
dave reuben
all right here's the best part of the
news today so biden finally made
his statement about uh tara reid
and he said this in an msnbc interview
uh he is uh saying unequivocally
never never happened it didn't it never
happened
now that's part's good if you're going
to deny something
you you don't want to say well why do
you think it happened
that sounds like a liar but if you just
say
did not happen didn't happen you might
be lying
you might be telling the truth but it's
more credible if you just go directly at
it no that just did not happen
but it wasn't all good for joe biden
because he kept talking and you know
that that's never good
and he kept talking until he confessed
but he didn't know he confessed
he didn't know he confessed let me read
it to you
he said this quote
oh he said quote i'm not going to
question her motive he said
i don't know why she's saying this so
far he's okay
all right he hasn't made his mistake yet
here it comes
i don't know why after 27 years all of a
sudden
this gets raised you hear it
i don't know why after 27 years all of a
sudden
this gets raised what's this
is this the thing that didn't happen if
something didn't happen
is that way the way you talk about it
the thing that didn't happen do you say
why did the thing
that didn't happen get raised now 27
years ago
no you do not you do not use those words
if it didn't happen this sentence
is basically a confession
all right i don't know why she's saying
this i don't know why after 27 years
all of a sudden this gets raised that's
a slip
and this means it happened
now you could say you could say he's
just not good at wording things
you could tell me that maybe it doesn't
mean anything it's just a
you know he's not careful with his words
maybe that's all
and that's possible i would not say
anything's a hundred percent but
i'm pretty good at this stuff in fact
i've
you know written in my books about how
to detect lies
and although i've never written about
this particular
you know tell this is glaring isn't it
somebody says isn't that mind reading
well it would be mind reading
if it weren't if i weren't looking at
evidence
so it's the evidence i'm looking at i'm
not relying on imagining what was in the
mind
now it is correct that simply looking at
the evidence doesn't mean i know what's
in somebody's mind so that would be that
would be mind reading
but if if somebody confesses to a crime
you can just read the confession and
maybe they don't mean it
you know maybe their mind is thinking
something different but
if somebody confesses you know you don't
say i'm being a mind reader by accepting
the
confession but your point is taken
then it turns out that the biden
campaign dispatched
operatives that's right they dispatched
some operatives i love the way that
when you're reading a news site that
doesn't like the other side
instead of saying you know some people
from the biden campaign
instead of saying that i think this was
on the fox news site
or was on some site i don't know but
uh they he dispatched operatives that
sounds like it was written by somebody
who doesn't like him
all right to delaware's library because
all of his i guess senate
documents and papers or all in some kind
of an archive that he donated to some
university in delaware and there's some
thought that that might include
the records of his accuser so there
might be some documentation of
her accusation at the time and there's
some conspiracy thinking that
the the biden uh operatives
snuck in and watergate-like they they
removed
they removed the damning stuff uh
i just wonder if there are any
handwritten notes sort of like the flynn
situation
is anybody going to find a handwritten
note in there it's like
remember to sexually harass staff or
something like that
all right so um the speculation is
now up again that hillary is just
waiting for biden to
crash and burn so she can jump in i am
firmly on the hillary is not going to do
that to camp
doesn't mean she won't flirt with it
doesn't mean she won't say it directly
i mean she might even come out of her
mouth but my prediction is
that she can't do it and the reason is
this the risk of losing twice
to trump would be
just too hard and she can't guarantee
that she would win
if she knew she would win let's say
trump's popularity was in the 30s
well then yeah probably she would but
he's
his popularity is sort of in the same
range where he beat her last time
and i don't think that clinton hillary
clinton has become
more popular since she's been gone she's
not becoming more popular is she or i
mean at least in terms of being a
politician
so here's my psychological prediction
that people are more influenced by
potential loss
than potential gain the potential gain
would be
being president and you know winning
after all that's a pretty big game
so you could say to yourself and you'd
be wrong well that's such a big game
gain of course she would head in that
direction
but because she lost once and she knows
how that feels
imagine how she felt can you even
imagine
what it felt like to be hillary clinton
for the first year or so
after trump won i mean that first year
had to be
really really bad and the first night oh
my god that had to be bad
and so my theory is this nobody would
take a chance
on doing that twice because if she lost
to him
twice that's the rest of her life she
has to think about that
losing once you can say hey i won the
popular vote
you know you've got an out
you could say well you know it was a
special case but she loses
twice she can't live with it so i say
that hillary will not do it although she
might flirt with it
i told you the other day that
uh there might be no news left for cnn
to report pretty soon
because if if too much of the news is
positive for trump
they can't talk about it so they the
other they're ignoring the
uh the biden accuser for the most part
or at least downplaying it
and i joked that the the simulation
needs to serve up some positive trial
trial results for hydroxychloroquine
because it would be like
it would be the next thing that the
simulation
should present because you want if you
really want the mainstream media to have
nothing to talk about
just make sure that hydroxychloroquine
actually works
and that there's a trial that says so
you give me that
and cnn has nothing to to talk about
today it'll just be dead air
because because the last thing they want
to do is admit that trump was right from
the jump
because it's starting to look like he
was right from the jump
meaning from the very first moment he
was saying you know
hydroxychloroquine it's already been
it's an existing drug
isn't that dangerous especially for
short-term use
even the doctors say so they're taking
it themselves
you know why don't we just try it seems
to be some early indication
if it doesn't work it doesn't work but
not much gets hurt
and he was just pilloried for that like
that was dumb but of course
he was the smart one in the room because
this was never a health care decision
it was always a a risk management
decision
and part of the risk is is the you know
what the experts are telling you but
part of the risk is the economy too
and as a leader he is not obliged to
take one expert's advice
and live with it he is obliged to look
at all the advice
and make a comprehensive decision i
believe that the president's
risk management analysis of
hydroxychloroquine
from the first day was spot on
meaning that we didn't know if it'd work
but there were some indications that you
know there was a good chance
and we knew the odds of hurting you were
so low
that if it worked it could save the
whole economy of the world
and it would be the biggest benefit ever
so the president was 100
right his critics were 100 wrong
very rarely can you say that but this is
actually math
so you can say that somebody is
unambiguously right
when it's just math and the math of it
was
that it was the right risk management
decision
no matter whether hydroxychloroquine
worked or not
now this assumes you have enough of it
which was the other problem they didn't
have enough of it
so um
the president's anyway this was reported
in zero hedge so that doesn't have much
credibility in the internet world
they've been
i think xero had just been banned from
twitter et cetera
so i can't tell you that zerohedge
reports only things that are true
but they do report that the association
of american physicians and surgeons
the aaps which has represented
physicians and blah blah blah since 1943
is just wrote a letter and saying
basically we should use this
hydroxychloroquine
because there are enough studies if you
look at all of them it's pretty clear
that it makes a difference so
um so that might be the news we were
waiting for
i remember i told you that this this
next two weeks
and we're sort of one week into the next
two weeks i was talking about
would be like incredible that a whole
bunch of stuff will emerge
that we find out we we invent we
discover
so it might be amazing all right
i will ask this question again until
somebody
offers an answer and it goes like this
somebody says uh in the comments scott
you were 60
40 against hydrox chloroquine yes i'm
still there
so i'm still at 60 chance it's not a
world changer
40 chance it is which is slightly
different from saying does it work a
little bit
you know whether it works a little bit
or not i'm not sure that
you wouldn't change anything so um
and let me say this let's say you've got
a leader
and there's a he's got a decision to
make or
she and the leader talks to all the
experts and
after all talking to experts um
finds out that there's a 70 chance if
you make
this decision things will go well and a
30
chance it won't so the leader takes the
odds
the high odds and makes the decision
that is a 70 percent chance to work out
right
but then in the end it doesn't it works
out wrong
would you say the leader made the wrong
decision
so that's your thought experiment if the
leader makes the decision
that favors the odds but it doesn't work
out
because not everything works out did the
did the leader make a mistake
well in our world we say yes the leader
made a mistake
but that's just bad thinking the leader
did not make a mistake
if you were to follow the odds every
time that they are presented
to you over time you're going to get
better results
assuming that the odds were properly
calculated over time you're going to
have more
right right than wrong decisions and
that's sort of the best you can do
nobody can guarantee that you got this
decision right
but it is nearly a guarantee that if you
follow the odds
consistently over your lifetime you're
almost certainly
to get better results than if you don't
you know you could get bad luck and
it doesn't work out but following the
odds is always the right decision
so if president trump had followed the
odds
which were let's try this stuff if it
doesn't work
a few people might die but it's still
worth it that's he couldn't say that out
loud but that's basically the
yeah expected value is the way you
calculate that so there's an actual
calculation for that
all right um
so when the president makes a decision
about opening or not
he's going to be doing it based on
statistics and the
odds as best he can calculate them and
i've been saying this from the beginning
since we're in a fog of war all of our
data is questionable
all of it everything we're finding out
about this virus
is questionable it's changed it's wrong
it's out of context
we don't have much good information at
least good enough
to be confident about the decision but
decision we must make
so i've been saying that no matter what
the president decides
and i will extend this to the governors
so it's not political
no matter whether you're a blue state or
red state governor
i'm going to say this as clearly as i
can and i'm going to be shouting this
in a few months like at the moment i
care about it
quite a bit but i'm going to really care
about it later
and it's going to make me mad and it
goes like this
all of these leaders i believe wants
want what's best
because of course what's best for their
state or the country
is what's best for them politically so
there's no difference
in what and what the leaders want they
want what's good
for the state and the country and that's
the only way it's good for them
period so they're making the first thing
you need to know is they're all making
honest honest decisions
without complications meaning that i
believe their intentions
pretty much universally exactly where
you want them
now somebody's saying hey michigan is
getting a little political whatever
you you could find differences in the
margins
like you could say oh the beach thing i
don't like that whatever
but those are not the big things you
know the big thing is the
the main businesses the economy so
different different leaders are going to
be making different decisions
i believe that all of them will be well
intentioned
informed as best they can be informed
and they'll they'll just have to take a
shot at it
so i would say you should forgive all of
them in advance
some of them are going to get it right
by luck
some of them are going to get it really
wrong but it's going to be kind of bad
luck
because there is a right answer and
there is something that's going to work
better than something else
but we don't know that and everybody who
says they do know that
is the least credible person in the
conversation
so if you're watching the pundits or you
know or you're on you're
on social media and somebody is saying
we must
do this no matter what is
no matter whether we must stay closed or
we
must open up now or anything in between
if you're positive about it
you're not very credible because you
shouldn't be positive
about something so unknowable the
experts don't know
you don't know the governors disagree
and we're all looking at the same stuff
right we're all pretty smart we all care
we all want what's best for the
you know the people in this country it's
just hard
and i think we should give them a pass
in advance
because some number of them are going to
make the wrong decision
don't know who but somebody's going to
be wrong and i'm going to say
be they democrat or be their republican
i'm going to say it just as loud at the
end
you didn't have to make that decision
you
didn't have to make that decision the
governor did
be they democrat be the republican be
they the president
they had to make the decision and i'm
going to give them
as much freedom
ahead of time as i can because i think
that's best for me and best for the
country i want them to
i want them to know that as long as
they're well intentioned
i'm going to have their backs after the
fact even if it goes wrong
even if it goes wrong i'm going to have
all of their backs
democrat or republican because there is
no right decision
and we need to get past that we need to
need to grow up a little
and say this is going to be tough some
of them are going to do it wrong
it's not because they're dumb it's not
because they didn't care it's not
because their intentions were wrong it's
just
hard that's it
all right i keep asking this question
and i haven't heard
an answer why can't we reopen the smart
way
and you know what the smart way is right
now again i don't know that it would
work
you know because nobody is that good at
predicting the future
but there is a smart way the smart way
is to send young people to work
and you know keep the old people back or
protect them or
or give them the option if they want to
take the choice but
why are we treating it like it's
geography
isn't that just stupid
forget about whether it works out well
or doesn't work out i honestly can't
tell the difference
like i don't know if doing it by
geography is actually the smart way i
don't know
but common sense tells me that sending
young people
back to school etc back to work you know
why can't starbucks be open with 20
somethings working the starbucks
is it because the customers will get
infected i mean there's a way to keep
them away from each other that
shouldn't be that hard so my only
my only hypothesis for why we're not
doing it the smart way
which is sending the young back to work
right away
is that the government can't suggest
that
because it would be age discrimination
i don't think anybody can say that out
loud but i can't think of another reason
not even a potential one that somebody
has suggested
oh it's because scott you forgot
you forgot because of this what's this
what am i forgetting tell me why a young
person can't go to work today
i think i think the reason that they
can't go to work
is that the government is the wrong
entity to make the decision
somebody says clay travis has been
saying this for weeks you know who else
has been saying this
every freaking citizen
of the united states every
single one you find me
one person in the united states who does
not agree with this statement
let's send the young people back to work
right away
find me one person who disagrees with
that
i don't think he can and and now it's
not happening so i imagine that if you
asked a politician in public
they would equivocate and answer the
wrong question and avoid the question
so i don't know if you can ask anybody
because they're not going to answer it
directly
i don't think anybody has an answer but
the the government
is the wrong entity because it requires
the kind of decisions the governments
are not allowed to make
your government is not allowed to say
i'm going to kill this
bunch of people to save this bunch of
people
and yet that's what the the this
decision
requires that there's no way around it
the government has to decide who's going
to die
not by name but in terms of category
can your government decide what category
is going to die
no because you can't be your government
if it does that
if the government said you know we're
going to let the people who are weak
and unhealthy die can't
government cannot make that decision and
yet
it has to be made it has to because
somebody's going to die either the
people who died from economic
calamity or the people who died because
they got the coronavirus on their old
or they have a co-morbidity or something
but somebody's going to die
our government is not the right
institution
to make decisions about who dies it
doesn't go well we don't like them to do
that
so people can decide you want to drive
that down to the lowest level
state local et cetera
all right but it seems to me that we
have the wrong government
to solve this problem still the best we
can come up with
i mean capitalism and democracy and all
that stuff the republic
is still the best system anybody's
invented
but it does have this weakness that it
can't it doesn't function
for this specific problem it just can't
and you're seeing the result of that
you're seeing that the president is
really a i would say the president is a
slave
to the medical experts because it's the
only thing that the public would accept
if the president made a decision that
was counter to what the medical experts
say
we would not accept our president
anymore right
if the medical expert said do a and your
leader doesn't matter who it is
your leader comes out and says well the
medical experts say a
but i've looked at the whole situation
if you consider everything
we're better off doing b that's the end
of the presidency
done that's the end the the president
cannot
overrule the experts in public because
that's the end of his
his administration so we don't have a
government that can make decisions in
these situations
and we need one and i think that's why
we're not opening the smart way because
you can't do age discrimination
and you can't do ability discrimination
you can't tell the 50 year old with
diabetes
that he or she can't go to work if you
told the 25 year old that they can
because our government doesn't allow you
to do that
somebody says keep age out of it
[Music]
well i suppose if you just say make your
own decisions
then you've kept age out of it but that
doesn't seem to be a
doesn't seem to be on the agenda do you
see that trump's job approval soared it
just
jumped up it's jumping up all over the
place
it's all over all right um there's not
much to say about that except that
i don't think anybody knows what's
happening with these trump approval
numbers
because it's changing from week to week
so wildly i don't even know what's
driving it
it's probably just people are just
starting to make up their mind about
stuff now before the election
and then the sweden question continues
which is
tucker carlson will tell you what's
working president trump will tell you
it's not
neither of them are true it's just a
different way of looking at the same
data
and if we can't decide if sweden is
working or not working
well we're going to have good luck
making a decision for our country
so that's it for me i will talk to you
tonight at the usual time for your
evening periscope
to ease you into your good night's sleep
for now let's have a fun day let's see
if anybody else realizes that biden just
confessed
biggest news in the country probably the
i'm the only one who will report it
and i will talk to you later tonight
