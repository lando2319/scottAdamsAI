Islands because I hear they have good
stuff all you need is a cup of mug or
glass
a tanker tells us time the canteen
jogger flaska vessel of any kind except
for an alien spacecraft and you can join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine at the end of the day the
thing that makes everything better is
called the simultaneous sip when it
happens now go
that's good that's good
well we are beset with technical
difficulties today
Chief among them I will not be able to
see all the comments on the locals
platform today
but I believe I can see them all on
YouTube
hey ladies and gentlemen
today I'm going to give you a test
it's a quiz
and I'm going to tell you a story you
know what's in the news allegedly
and you have to tell me is it a real
news story or did it come from a Dilbert
comic you ready
is it a real news story or did it come
from a Dilbert comic number one
uh artificial intelligence is being
added to Suicide drones
go Artificial Intelligence being added
to dangerous suicide drones real
real or Dilbert comic
uh only one person got it right only one
person got it right
it's both
by coincidence the Dilbert comic that I
just finished writing is about Dilbert's
company adding AI to a suicide drone
and it achieves Consciousness and
decides it doesn't want to die after all
which makes it a very bad suicide drone
so what are you going to do if you've
got an AI suicide drone that doesn't
want to die
you got to call dogberg
because dog burp
he'll talk it off the ledge
and when I say off the ledge you know
off the ledge so yes it's a true story
in Ukraine they are adding AI in Ukraine
the purpose of it is that when the
drones get jammed
uh they can still attack
so once the programming of where they're
supposed to go gets jammed from the
ground the AI takes over and says oh I'm
jammed but I think I know what I'm
supposed to do anyway
sounds totally safe to me I can't think
of anything that would go wrong can you
Skynet what
all right
all right here's the next one Dilbert or
reality Dilbert or reality right I'm
going to read you
um some
let's see this is a some guidance
that's been giving to an entity
right so this is a some guidance being
given to some entity is it real or
Dilbert comic
uh we will press on the gas and what
look on what works and pump the brakes
on what doesn't we will continue to make
constant improvements as we move forward
we will cut down on an event and travel
costs utilize uh of our staff custom
reinvest in what will win this and okay
yes this is from the Iran DeSantis
messaging
guidance
let me read the first
oh my God it starts with leaning into
the reset apparently they have to reset
because they're not getting the results
they want
um
and here's what they're going to do the
underlying strategic goals for this
reset is to put the candidate his
biography and his vision for the Great
American comeback front and center of
everything the campaign does
was that something they weren't doing
before
was Ron DeSantis not the sort of the
center and the focus of the Iran
descentesis campaign apparently not
apparently apparently one of the
mistakes of the DeSantis campaign was
they forgot the candidate
they must have been focusing on
something else but now they're going to
reset and they're going to make sure
that the actual candidate is front and
center of everything the campaign does
it kind of raises some questions what
were they doing before
um
or about hone in and highlight the Great
American comebacks Central themes
for focusing the campaigns
Communications on what matters most to
voters not the national Media or the
political class
now that's an interesting interesting
idea it's a candidate running for office
and they've come up with this new
strategy of focusing on what voters want
to hear
you know that's crazy enough to work
has anybody tried that before has
anybody tried saying things that their
base wants to hear
because apparently the Ron DeSantis
campaign wasn't doing that but now
they're thinking all right what we're
going to do is we're going to talk about
the fact that Ron DeSantis is in the
campaign we'll kind of focus on that and
we might actually even talk about things
that people care about
so that would be new
so I think they were focusing on
somebody else and talking about things
that nobody cared about except the elite
um what else will they do let's see
they'll Embrace being the underdog and
use the media's ongoing narrative about
the campaign to fuel momentum on the
ground with
okay Mike cernovich pointed this out on
Twitter and oh my God
as Mike points out it's kind of easy to
see what the problem is isn't it
well when we thought he was boring
DeSantis
I didn't know that he was hiring people
who were more boring than he is
and and
let me tell you here's the funny part
labeled right at the top
is messaging guidance
now if somebody
feels that their job is to give you
messaging guidance
is it a red flag that they can't write
maybe maybe the next time somebody says
they're going to give you messaging
guidance you should see if they can make
a message of any kind themselves that
isn't literally laughable
as a joke
it's actually literally being used as
humor
no joke
without any changes to it it's being
used as humor
that's that's not good that's not good
all right here's the next one
uh Dilbert or reality
um
the UF there's UFO whistleblowers we're
going to testify that unknown objects
are quote far superior to U.S technology
or if I could put this in my own words
uh breaking news U.S technology is
inferior to a fly on a camera lens
so we're going to learn that today
U.S technology is far inferior to a fly
on a camera lens is that real
or is that a Dilbert comic
real or a dilber comic oh that was real
that was real it will be a dilbra comic
oh oh yeah it will be a dilbra comic
really quickly but so far it's just real
so far
all right you want to hear the biggest
news in the world
do you think that I will give you the
biggest news in the world next biggest
news in the world
Maybe
or maybe fake news
but it couldn't be the biggest news in
the world
there's a uh some scientists who believe
they have solved
for the creation of ambient temperature
superconductivity
meaning that it doesn't need to be super
Frozen to be superconductive now you say
to yourself but Scott I'm not a freaking
nerd I don't even know what that means
well thank you
you if you're not a nerd you don't know
what that means and that would be pretty
normal pretty normal however
can anybody raise their hand in the
comments
do we have any nerds here who say oh my
God if that's true that changes
everything
it's probably not true so there's one
study they think they can reproduce it
but we'll see if it were true
it would change civilization
fundamentally
you'd have Quantum Computing you would
have lossless energy you'd have you
could build nuclear facilities with far
greater safety and
basically everything would be different
our entire technology
infrastructure would just be thrown out
and you just start over with this stuff
it was like you would just throw
everything away it would be all new
after this
or
is it already retracted
somebody just said retracted
don't ruin it when I've got a whole day
to feel good about it before it gets
retracted
yeah I'm I'm assuming it's not true
you think that's a safe assumption
just assume it's not true
it's probably not true
uh what what are the odds that any study
in science or breakthrough in science is
actually true
it doesn't matter what it is or what
topic it's a big breakthrough in science
and only one group of people has proven
it
less than half
now it's less than half for all science
but what are the odds when it's a
breakthrough change civilization claim
are those about 50 50 everything in the
entire world will change really quickly
about 50 50. I doubt it it's probably
closer to one percent
would you agree with that number
that if somebody makes a scientific
claim based on one group or one test or
one study or one experiment
and the claim is it will just change
civilization like this this would change
civilization what are the odds that that
claim is right
maybe one percent
possibly one yeah
but hey
for about 10 minutes I'm going to make
you feel good that it might be true
all right um
here's a story that was breaking today
on the Bay Bridge the San Francisco Bay
Bridge which is just over there not too
far from where I live it's a bridge I
use a lot traffic was halted after a
naked woman exits vehicle and opens fire
now I'd like to add some commentary to
this about the naked woman exiting their
vehicle and opening fire in the Bay
Bridge
and maybe some of you have the same
experience and you're feeling the same
way
am I the only one who's a little bit
turned on by this story
is it just me
I mean not a lot but a little bit I'm a
little bit turned on and I immediately
wanted to know more about the weapon
thank you
this that was my first because I wanted
to like picture it because if it was a
naked woman on a bridge and she had a
like a 22 pistol
yeah
isn't that it's not really that hot
but what if it was like a AR
am I right I mean what if she was really
just trapped
and she was naked on a bridge
I don't know
I I'm a little turned on by it that's
all I hope nobody got hurt
on another story that uh Larry Elder
running for president
he tweeted a formula to escape poverty
he says it's simple now you've heard
this before it's been studied many times
but to avoid poverty you would only have
to do these four things according to
according to studies
finish High School
get a job and then don't quit that job
unless you have another one lined up
don't have a child before marriage
and avoid the criminal justice system
and you're good
now that's to avoid poverty
now I I tweeted this and they said why
isn't that written above every classroom
door
and I'm not exaggerating I'm not that's
not hyperbole
it should be written
actually literally in actual words and a
real sign
and put it over every door to every
classroom
because you want your kids to look at
the list and say oh shoot
it looks like I'm heading for poverty
because I look at you know I'm planning
to do number three on this list and it
says don't do that
but I'm planning to do it I'm going to
do some crime and
have some unprotected sex
so
at the very least we should let people
know that they're bringing it on
themselves to some extent
so that they'll get off our backs
because I hate it when people don't
succeed and make it my problem
so I would love to say how about how
about this you do these four things
and things don't work out
I'll take that as my problem
deal just do these four things if it
doesn't work out for you I'm all in see
what we can do is there some
discrimination yep see if I can fix it
yeah or at least help right
all I ask is you do the four things you
do the four things and they'll help you
with anything else you need
to upgrade that list from Larry Elder
and again this is other researchers have
said the same
but I think you could take it up to the
next level because avoiding poverty is
not exactly
you know it doesn't get your juices
flowing does it wouldn't you like to be
really really successful
or at least you know had more than
avoiding po poverty at least the solid
middle class life something like that so
here's my list so I've got
um five things
and some of them are duplicative stay
out of jail
stay off of drugs and addictions you
know illegal addictions now that's very
similar to stay on a jail but there are
plenty of people who stay in a jail and
have addiction problems that ruin their
lives so stay out of jail isn't good
enough you got to stay out of jail but
you need to avoid the bad kind of
addictions a good addiction would be
like exercise a bad addiction you know
Fentanyl
um instead of finish High School which
of course is absolutely necessary in my
opinion
um I would say continuous learning and
building a talent stack
right you don't want to get too locked
into must have a college degree or
something like that but you should make
it a habit that you're never not
learning a new skill that makes you more
useful that's the difference between
being not poor
and succeeding just that difference all
right how about uh you know don't I have
a child before you can afford it I think
so Larry said don't have a child before
marriage now don't have a child before
marriage
fits much better into let's say a
conservative mindset but I don't think
that would sell as well
I I think the more General way to say is
don't have a child before you can afford
it
before you can afford it
because Elon Musk
has a number of children he's not
married at the moment
so it really is just finances right if
you have enough money you can hire
you know hire somebody to help you
but if you don't have money having a kid
is a really tough road
so as much as I agree that if you could
find the right partner and stay married
to them forever that is your best
situation
but it's also unrealistic that everybody
can do that we all think we can try it
but you know maybe
maybe 20 succeed so you don't want that
to be a requirement for success
if only 20 are succeeding at getting
married and staying married or whatever
it is but it's not good
um so I just say it's about money make
sure you can afford it whether that
involves marriage or not and then I
would add to the list develop your
systems for fitness and diet
totally underrated
everybody has like a superpower if their
Fitness and their diet are good and they
walk into a room and people look at them
and say whoa there's a healthy looking
person it changes everything changes
your personal life your social life your
business life
everything your health
so I think that should be basic and and
separating your Fitness and diet from
the question of success is a huge
mistake
you know your your exercise your diet is
what gives you energy the energy is what
helps you succeed at anything plus how
you look because we're we're a very
shallow civilization so how you look
matters you should at least do the best
you can do with what you got
so I I think my list is a little bit
better because it has higher aspiration
than just not being in poverty but some
version of that
should be above every classroom
now I will give you a preview that I'm
working on a a success guide uh with
Joshua lisac and we're putting that
together about halfway done and that
would uh
teach people basic skills of success you
know beyond this little list so that
should be available to uh to everybody
as soon as we get it done
all right
um I saw a Vivek appear on NBC News
and it is so funny
watching NBC News deal with the
political stuff
once you've been told that they're
really just a CIA organ and you know
they're not real news organization at
least that's my current understanding is
the NBC is not actually a real news
organization it's sort of a captured one
now that's based on you know reports and
examples and people who are less smarter
than me who've been talking about them
for a long time but it appears to be the
case if You observe it meets the way
they act is consistent with that so
Vivek goes on NBC News and the the very
first question is
why did somebody say something about a
conspiracy theory and you agreed with
the conspiracy theory
it was a real wacky conspiracy theory it
doesn't even matter what it is
just miles he said well that didn't
happen yeah I'm paraphrasing uh you you
may have you know edited something but
no I was not I was not agreeing with a
weird conspiracy theory that frankly I'd
never even heard of I was saying that
you know this or that is a bad idea
about the fathom digital currency and
stuff so
now what would you think would happen at
that point when somebody says why did
you agree with that man about a
conspiracy theory and the person says oh
that didn't happen maybe it's just the
way you cut it I was actually talking
about a different topic
don't you think that should be the end
of the conversation
don't you think the person asking the
question should say okay just to make
sure though you don't believe in this
conspiracy theory to which he clearly
said I don't even know what that is he
wasn't even aware of what that
conspiracy theory was all about much
less much less agreed with it he wasn't
even sure what the details were
don't you think that should be the end
of the questioning on that once he said
he doesn't know what it is and it
certainly wasn't answering that question
no she just got really angry and started
yelling at him so that the viewers would
think he was lying
she actually tried to sell this to the
viewers as there was something wrong
with Vivek because he wouldn't admit
that he had agreed in public to a wacky
conspiracy theory that he was not even
aware of
that that passed as news
if you didn't know about NBC News and
you watched that you probably would have
gone away with the theory that he was
lying and there isn't there isn't a
chance in the world he was lying I mean
none
you just have to have a little bit of
you know media understanding to know
that
you know Vivek was uh telling the truth
and NBC was
I don't know if it was intentional but
it looked intentional you can't tell
all right but again I love the fact that
Vivek is going into the lions den
he goes into the hardest situations and
at least for the base who he's talking
to at the moment because this is the
primaries the bass
likes it I like it when it goes in there
and mixes it up
so um do you remember yesterday I read
you a very amusing tweet from a Twitter
user named Dom Luker
and it was it was about Obama's chef and
uh his tragic death is drowning
and
I read that to you and now he's
suspended from Twitter
for talking about some theories about
Obama's chef
suspended from Twitter
over half a million followers
and suspended from Twitter with I
believe no explanation
is that cool with you
everybody cool with that somebody with
half a million followers talking about a
story that's in the news and I don't
know what he said
but I'm really not comfortable
not knowing what he got canceled for
are you
so I think I think this is a
maybe the biggest
user related concern you know beyond
some technical concerns but as a user
um
this is probably my greatest concern
about Twitter or X the way it's
currently constituted the fact that it
is we'd be bad enough
that the user who gets suspended doesn't
know why that's very bad very very bad
right because we can't even learn what
not to do
if somebody gets suspended and you've
been talking about the same topic and
you look over there like uh should I
stop talking about this
wouldn't it be good if you told us why
the other guy got or other woman or
whoever got suspended wouldn't that be
useful
I'd like to know but um
I think that I think that the importance
of it to free speech goes beyond letting
the suspended person now
the rest of us should know why somebody
got banned that feels like basic hygiene
would you agree
because you know Twitter X is trying to
become a free speech you know the beacon
of light in the darkness and this is
more Darkness this is not this is not a
beacon of light this is Darkness that's
exactly the opposite of what we want and
expect and frankly deserve
so there may be more to the story and by
the way I don't know what he did
um we're speculating maybe it was bad
yeah maybe he deserved to get banned or
suspended Maybe
and how long is this suspension I don't
know
but I'd like to know that too is it
permanent
um
in other news Joe Biden said and I quote
uh in a public forum he said I said I'd
cure cancer they looked at me like why
cancer
because we can we ended cancer as we
know it
now
I guess I'm going to blame my news
source for failing me but I was not
aware that he cured cancer
so good for him good for him
um so he's got that going for him so the
bidens of course are coming under Fire
for a number of allegations
but I think we all have to
put it in context
sure
there might be some misdeeds
by the president maybe he doesn't speak
as well as he used to maybe he's not
cognitively 100 percent
but the man cured cancer
so he's got that going for him
you know
someday when we look back we're going to
say
I feel bad that we ever criticized him
when he was out there curing cancer now
there's nowhere to whether he got
scientists involved or he did it himself
he may have actually done it himself you
know mixing stuff up in the kitchen and
stuff but we don't we don't know a lot
about that but he did cure cancer and he
wouldn't lie about that so so that's
true in other news Hunter sold a
painting
for over a million dollars to a
political donor
a Democrat donor who was immediately
rewarded with a
appointment to a position that was
apparently wanted
now uh
on the surface this would look like a
some kind of a you know bribery
pay-to-play kind of thing and it will
look totally transparent and it would
seem as if every single human being
could see there's something terribly
terribly wrong is happening with Hunters
selling of his paintings but if you're
going to be some kind of a jerk about
that maybe I should remind you that his
father cured cancer
so if you're like blah blah blah his
paintings
put it in context please people he cured
cancer his father did
um then we heard a story that Hunter
Biden's lawyer
said this one is too weird to even be
true
I'm going to say that I don't believe
this story
I feel like there's some details missing
but I'll tell you what the story is but
be skeptical about this one this one's
way too on the nose
this has on the nose all over it but the
story is
um that one of uh some attorneys
associated with Hunter Biden's legal
team so the associated attorney uh
contacted the court clerk's office
falsely claimed to be part of the house
Ways and Means legal team
and asked the clerk to pull the adverse
filing about Hunter for technical
reasons
I guess the court figured out what was
happening
and now they're you know demanding
answers Etc
so
an attorney associated with Hunter
tried to pull it allegedly tried to pull
a trick to get a you know some kind of
filing pulled
now if that were true and if that person
were working for Hunter Biden that would
be one of the most blatantly terrible
things I've ever seen in my life
but
if that's going to bother you
I think you're just forgetting Hunter's
father cured cancer
so what's a court filing compared to
that am I right all right well and then
also I tweeted this today it is the most
fascinating thing
to watch the the story evolve from hey
there's something on Hunter's laptop
that looks a little suspicious
and you're like huh I wonder if that's
really what it looks like
and then you know time goes by and
things are investigated and more and
more comes out and I heard that Jesse
Waters do this spectacular rundown of
all the Hunter and Joe Biden you know
crime family allegations and when I say
allegations I mean the things we know
are true
if you put them all together the the
story is so insanely clear
that it that as soon as Joe Biden would
get a portfolio
you're like okay Joe you're the point
man for China
hunter gets on the plane goes over there
and comes back with millions of dollars
from China
okay Joe you're going to be the part
Point man for Ukraine
hunter gets on a plane comes back with
millions of dollars from Ukraine
because once the point man is is
established the point man can
take bribes you know the indirect way
by uh feeding family members
you know sweet ordeals
so here's what's interesting about the
so this the the story started down as
this set of allegations that even I had
some suspicions about and I thought yeah
maybe
but I mean I'm gonna wait on this one
because there might be more to this
story maybe it's maybe it's totally
legal it just I don't know that
so but more and more comes out and
you've got the partners of Hunter Biden
and then you've got the whistleblowers
and then you've got the documents and
the more documents
at this point
would you say the following statement is
true
the Biden crime family story
is a fact
is it an allegation still or would you
say in your in your personal view
because it's subjective do you think it
has transformed from an allegation to
now a very clear fact
and probably a clear fact than anything
in politics
am I right it's hard to imagine anything
more clear than this or well documented
with sources including people under oath
you've got you know multiple
corroborating people you've got the same
pattern of pattern of behavior in
different countries with the same kind
of timing right so it's all there as
clear as possible is pure fact
but half of the country is unaware
is that fascinating or what
half of the country
is completely unaware that this is true
and that that situation you wonder can
they maintain that Biden's poll numbers
are unchanged as far as I know they're
still about the same his poll numbers
are unchanged and I don't think that the
news is you know they're barely covering
it but even when CNN covers it as they
have
they they don't do what Jesse Waters did
which really makes it really clear he
just goes bullet point by bullet point
of the things that we know to be true no
speculation
just the things that are confirmed and
known to be true
it is completely clear there there's no
ambiguity about what's happening
and what will happen
now it seems to me that this is so big
and so clear
that it just can't be kept from the
public forever I mean half of the public
who is blinded to any news that's
negative to their side
now that that would be true at both
sides right both sides are a little bit
blind to the other but in this case it's
the sitting president so it seems worse
so
what's going to happen
so let's let's do a prediction here
so my thesis which I believe every one
of you agreed with is that the Croc the
Biden crime family story went from
allegation to now fact in all of our
minds that are paying attention and
what happens if the other half of the
country never figures it out
could could this be kept
Secret
because you know I think the Republicans
will do at least they'll try some
impeachment sort of thing and the
impeachment thing would be played the
same way the Democrats did it really for
the cameras and really just to inform
the public of their version of events
you know like the January 16th
except different because you don't have
to lie
the January sixth thing was an OP it was
it was trying to make something that was
a protest primarily into a Insurrection
which of course it never was
but the Biden crime family things looks
like it's straightforward it's exactly
what it looks like
that's different than January 6. that's
more of an interpretation
so
um
the possibilities are terrible because
one of the possibilities is that whoever
is really running the Biden White House
has to just take over the country
so one possibility is totalitarianism
to protect all the guilty people who
would presumably go to jail
so
and then now let me ask you another
question just to blow your minds
you ready to have your mind blown
suppose
uh legal action
started to emerge let's say
hypothetically Republicans win
everything in the next election and they
they start to put the legal screws on
Hunter and maybe even Joe
I don't know if there's anything illegal
by the way it could be totally legal the
way they did it
I don't know if there's anything illegal
but here just work with me let's say
there is
and Hunter doesn't want to go to jail
and Joe Biden doesn't want to go to jail
do they have anything to trade
do Hunter and Joe Biden have anything
they would trade to not go into jail
yes they know every other dirty
politician in Washington all of them
Joe Biden is aware of everybody else's
crime in Washington all bad
you want to bet against it I'll bet he
is aware of everybody who's doing stuff
like this and he would have the deepest
dossier of secrets that he would unleash
potentially I'm just you know sort of
speculating through what could happen so
one thing that could happen is that the
bidens could unravel the entire deep
State as the only way to stay out of
jail
however
If there really is a deep State they
would kill him
so you might find him dying suddenly in
his sleep rather quickly
does anybody want to make a bet that Joe
Biden dies suspiciously
if the Biden crime family story becomes
uh impossible to suppress
so that the rest of the country is going
to find out I think he dies mysteriously
and everybody says well he was that age
I think he would be killed by our own
government
If he if he said I'm going to flip to
stay out of jail he would be killed
immediately
that's what I think
um
so we might have some really interesting
things coming up and although the Biden
crime family story in my opinion is now
established as a fact and that sounds
really really bad because it suggests
that he was selling policy influence
or could have or or at least was
influenced by money but again
if you're bothered by that you have to
put that in context he did cure cancer
Glenn Greenwald was uh laughing about
this in a tweet he said
the next topic that was so funny how
they found cocaine in the white house
probably the most surveilled building on
the planet and after a week they were
like yeah we uh we looked and
unfortunately we can't find who left it
and the media said oh okay too bad
thanks for looking
owned media
that's pretty owned
that's pretty owned now I will say again
I hope we never learn who left the
cocaine
it's it's amazing that they can't tell
us or they're you know they're lying
like they can't tell us but I don't want
to know
I do not want to know because to me
that's that's a single individual's
problem with their employer
and I don't need to know about an
employee misbehaving right
so even if it's Hunter I don't need to
know
do I need to know that Hunter might do
cocaine
what would that tell me
he said he's an addict
so even if he's clean at the moment I
don't know one way or another but if
he's clean at them at the moment it
doesn't mean that he won't do it in the
future
so if he did it wouldn't even be a story
in my mind uh addict does drugs
that's the story that's not a story even
even the president's kid because it's
already known he's an addict once you've
established addict
that if the addict uses something that's
not really news
because you established that with addict
that that's very possible
all right um
China's top foreign Diplomat disappeared
so China making people disappear
don't you wonder what happens to him
so this is the top Forum Minister uh
Quinn yet Queen gang I don't know how do
you spell q-i-n Quinn or Kim
Quan
I don't know how to pronounce it but
he's a he is apparently uh disappeared
nobody and of course China doesn't say
where he is or anything he was
dramatically ousted
but do you imagine that when you get
dramatically ousted that they kill you
right away
or they put you in prison or is it like
Jack ma where he forever will be watched
and never be a free man
is it like that I always wondered
so uh poor guy
and then the other big issue that oh my
god do I not want to talk about this
guess what issue I don't want to talk
about but it's in the news
yeah vaccinations
but I have to because it's just such a
big story so LeBron James son bronnie
um and some kind of
heart attack or stroke or I don't know
what it was but he had some issues that
people are saying hey
could it be because you're vaccinated
but there's no information in that some
singer I never heard of Tori Kelly
had some medical issues and people think
that might be vaccinations but I have no
information on that Jamie Foxx some
people say he had a stroke he's being
private about that and then others
saying it's the vaccination
all right
what do you think
what do you think
do you think these were all vaccination
myocarditis and strokes and stuff
I'm going to say that news about three
people doesn't mean anything
so I'm going to stick with math and
probability
do you think that ever there's ever been
three people in their age ranges
who had unexpected health problems at
the same roughly the same few weeks
well it's not even the same few weeks
because
Jamie Foxx was quite a while ago
so if you said all right let's pick any
three month period would that would that
be enough to capture JB Fox all the way
through broady James and Tori Kelly
so if you took a three-month
period
of any time in our history could you
find three people in this age range and
remember Jamie Foxx is not Young
give me an age on Jamie Foxx
late 40s 50.
how old is Jamie Foxx
no he's not 59 is he he's in his 50s
right
I mean he looks great so he seems like
he's younger but you or at least he did
he was an amazing kid well I think he's
in his 50s so if
so let's say let's say you removed the
one who's in his 50s
let's say you said well that's not it's
not unusual if somebody in their 50s
has a stroke would you agree it's not
that unusual somebody in their 50s
now he was in great shape so that that's
certainly a factor but if you took him
out of the mix you'd have Rodney James
and Tori Kelly
how unusual would it be over a period of
several months that two people in their
age group at a medical event
of this nature
I don't know
to me it doesn't look unusual and
therefore
while vaccines are your first suspect
could we all agree that the vaccines are
the first suspect
because I I don't have any issue with
that
would you agree it's the first suspect
now I would say drugs are not the first
suspect because bronnie James is
involved
if you tell me that Ronnie James was
doing drugs that would kill him
I would say you're crazy
because because I'm going to give LeBron
who's not my favorite you know person in
the world at least in terms of his
politics great player but I'm going to
give broad a little credit here I don't
believe his kid is on any dangerous
drugs I don't believe that
so
um I mean I suppose we live in a
complicated world and anything's
possible I suppose but
I don't know no I so I would re I think
that vaccination would be a higher
possibility somebody's saying steroids
but I saw a picture of him without his
shirt
I wouldn't say steroids
and I would imagine they get tested at
his level
don't they get tested in college
I don't know the answer to that but
now I can't see it I just don't see it
but possible anything's possible so I
would say if you think vaccine is the
number one potential thing
I wouldn't argue with that
I wouldn't argue with that at all
I just don't know that it's true
all right would you agree that at this
point uh every study about vaccines and
masks is
can we say that
would you agree there's none of it
that's reliable
so one today that seemed to indicate
that the uh the vaccines might cause you
myocarditis but the
um
but the long coven would not do you
believe that's true
so a big study
says that vaccination could give you
problems specific kind of problems
myocarditis but that the
the disease itself would not do you
believe that
do you believe that covet is the first
disease that or the first thing of its
kind it's the first one
that amazingly did not cause you to have
myocarditis sometimes
because that would be sort of a weird
Miracle wouldn't it
because I'm pretty sure that anything
that hits you as hard as Covent
can give you a little chance of
myocarditis
right so to me that doesn't even sound a
little bit true
oh actually it might be true
but I don't believe the analysis or the
study
the same way every study looks sketchy
to me now at this point literally
everything looks sketchy so I just don't
believe anything
all right
um
yeah John Campbell
oh great where uh this this is an
important Point gray bear is pointing
out that I'm not a medical doctor
can we all laugh at him
I'm gonna laugh at you for imagining
that a medical doctor would have better
opinions than I do on this
[Laughter]
sorry I just have to do that
yeah because the experts they really
nailed at this time did they
how about your doctor
did your doctor read that study
and did he reproduce it did you
duplicate it because yeah reading the
study isn't going to tell you that much
but did he duplicate it in his office
in his spare time
yeah
yeah I'm glad you listened to your
doctor and not the cartoonist I would
like to remind you that I had the best
pandemic predictions
in the country
not because I'm smart
not because I'm smart
but because I didn't make predictions on
 I couldn't predict
it turns out it was easier than I
thought
just don't make a prediction on
something you don't know anything about
do you remember my prediction
about the vaccinations working
I only made one prediction
that they wouldn't work
before they rolled out
before they rolled out I said they
wouldn't work
I'm the only one well there's some
scientists said it but in the in the
pundit Community I was a little bit
alone say you know all the experts are
saying we've been trying for 20 years
we're not even close so I'm going to go
with the experts who say can't be done
this quickly
and sure enough it wasn't
sure enough
now uh how about uh how about my
predictions on masks
I'm the only person who said that fauci
was intentionally lying when he said
they wouldn't help which is separate
from the question of do they help
I I'm the only person who called him out
as a liar day one who was the first
person in the country to call fauci a
liar me on the first one because his
mask thing was so obviously a lie
intended to reduce the you know the run
on masks now separately
what did I say about the effectiveness
of masks
I said no mandate
right I said that the the overall like
um
you know was City level down level don't
show any Improvement
right at the population level shows no
difference
and I said that from an engineering
perspective it would have to be true
that in the limited circumstance it must
make some difference you know maybe it's
maybe the only difference is it breaks
your grandma a little bit safer if you
only were in the room for five minutes
just the smallest little special cases
but nothing else
and that's exactly where science ended
up
so I was perfect on masks
that was perfect on vaccinations
I was perfect on lockdowns
I got everything right
I was 100 right about everything nobody
else was I got everything right now
here's here's where I did not get in
trouble
so I didn't tell you that there was some
study that was definitely right
I didn't do that
right I told you I told you that 95 of
all the stuff you saw would be wrong
at the very least
and it was
95 was wrong
so
nobody came close to my pandemic
predictions now some of you are probably
wondering why were so many people saying
I got everything wrong
well there was some kind of 4chan hoax
in which they reversed My Views and it
was a famous comic they showed my views
opposite so it made it look like I was
recommending vaccinations for you which
never happened
never happened
never recommended a vaccination never
recommended a lockdown although the
two-week thing I thought was worth
experimenting with that was two weeks
hahaha
uh oh wait wait wait hold on but
somebody says but you took it
you took it
hold on a second
uh do you think that that's a good point
that I took that I took the shot
do you think that's a good point
does it make anything I said not true
but I want but I want to see which one
of you uh believe that your opinion of
my medical choices
should be important is there anybody
here who thinks that my personal medical
choices are your business
oh oh you think that my personal medical
choices are your business
really
you think that
if I had recommended what you do
and it had been wrong that would be a
conversation
but your opinion of my personal medical
decisions are useless
and I don't want to hear from you
ever about my personal medical decisions
and you know I'm not going to tell you
not to make your personal medical
decisions I don't do it in the trans
conversation for adults children are
always a special case but for adults I'm
not telling anybody what to do
I'm not telling them they're wrong or
right is not my business what you did or
did not do with your body during the
pandemic
absolutely none of my business
but likewise your opinion of my choices
completely irrelevant to me
and completely irrelevant to anybody
else
why you think that's important to you is
because you're up
you're up if you think that my
personal medical decision has somehow
some importance to you
you need help like maybe you need a
therapist or a drug or something
but
no we're not gonna We're not gonna have
the conversation about my personal
choices
they're mine that's it
and I was the first one to say you
should take vitamin D and get exercise I
was the first one that made that
correlation and said hey everybody's
having a good outcome has good vitamin D
that can't be an accident I got
everything right I literally got
everything right
but of course because trolls are trolls
it looks different I was right about
Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
completely right because you know what I
said about them
they said we don't know the I said the
the tests are unreliable
right
so I can't be wrong I'm just saying the
tests are unreliable might have worked
maybe not I never said they didn't work
did I ever say that I said the odds of
them being good go down the longer you
go without knowing for sure
so we'll see anyway so that's all for
today's I hate talking about this topic
because everybody flips out
and uh all the comments just went away
on on YouTube for some reason
um
did you see that Dr Drew got demonetized
on YouTube
did anybody see that and I believe that
the reason was
but actually I don't know because I'm
not sure he knows the reason but so I'd
be speculating I think it's because
things is guests said
and that's like shocking
if you're if your show is having people
on who are saying things the mainstream
is not saying and that's why it's an
interesting guest
if that's the reason I got a problem
with that a big one but I don't know all
the details I'm not sure I'm not sure Dr
Drew knows exactly what's going on yet
but keep an eye on that
because if that's what it if that's what
it looks like
that's completely unacceptable
but you know maybe we'll learn more soon
all right that's all I got for you today
and I will talk to you later YouTube
thanks for joining bye for now
