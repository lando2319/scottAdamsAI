[Music]
hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
best part of the day every single time
and today is going to be i don't like to
brag
but it's going to be the best coffee
with scott adams
since i don't know yesterday at least
and what do you need to participate what
do you need
well all you need it is a copper
bug or a glass you need a tanker
chalice or stein you could use a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
well if you can't tell from looking
behind me
i am not in my house in california i've
escaped to arizona for a couple days
uh the update on my house in california
is
that as of last night it's off the
danger zone
so it looks like the fire department and
all of their volunteers
made a stand but also the
the weather miraculously changed so if
the weather forecast had gone
as forecast with lots of dry lightning
and
lots of wind in the wrong direction
my house may have gone up in smoke
would have been happening right now
actually but
got a little text last night that says
the wind changed
and the conditions have softened
and my house will not be burning down
today now i want to give you a little
vacation tip
um it's hard to take any kind of a
vacation arizona's
kind of a free state so we got to pop
over here for a couple days
and if you've ever arranged
to have a massage at the same time that
your house
may or may not be burning down
i would recommend this is just sort of a
travel tip
don't schedule a massage at
approximately
the same time as your house might be on
fire
because those two activities they're not
entirely compatible
it's hard to relax um i changed my uh
yeah all the pets are okay the the house
is fine
uh and obviously i have somebody at the
house watching it so there was
no danger for the pets um
i have changed my hotel accommodations
as you can see it's a little bit better
than it was before
got a great view here today the uh first
place
the first place that we were staying we
always try to get a place that's got at
least
two bathrooms because we we hate to
overlap i like my privacy in my bathroom
and it's just good to have
two bathrooms so it's one of my my
only serious luxuries in life
yeah i'm not too big on collecting stuff
but i like to have two bathrooms when i
travel it's where i'd like to spend my
money
and the other place had two bathrooms
but one of them was like a dog's
shower i didn't realize that until i
tried to take a shower in it
and apparently it was just sort of for
washing your dog
wasn't exactly what i was hoping for but
this place
quite good it's actually a house it's a
rented house all right
let's talk about all the stuff all the
stuff enough about me
there's a big story about jerry falwell
jr
in a sex scandal kind of situation
and for some reason this is national
news
now i don't know why because i'm not
going to repeat the details of the
allegations but they don't involve any
victims
there's no victims there's nobody you
know underage
there's nobody who cheated there's
nobody who
lied there's nobody who broke a
commandment
but there's this little private story
about jerry felwell jr and his wife
and i'm thinking who exactly thinks this
should be national news
i get that it's interesting but making
it national news
that is just so wrong um and if you're
on the left i would think you would be
especially eager not to make this
national news because isn't a big part
of the left's
philosophy and by the way one that i buy
into completely
that everybody's different you know are
we trying to get away from
you know on the left anyway trying to
get away from
everybody's fitting into one box you're
either gay or you're
uh you're either your man or a woman you
know isn't the whole
idea of the left that you could be
anywhere on the rainbow
anywhere on the spectrum as long as
you're not bothering anybody and
breaking the law
i thought that was their own philosophy
so if the people on
the right care about it and i doubt it
i don't know why they would care because
again he didn't break a commandment
didn't break a law there are no victims
there was nothing dishonest
in any of the allegations so under those
situations
why is this news it just it's disgusting
really
um let's talk about the rnc convention
now i sometimes watch the the big events
uh after the fact so that i can see the
highlight clips
without seeing the texture of the entire
thing
the theory for this is that most voters
also will not see the entire event what
the voters will see is the highlight
clips and
whatever whatever comes out of it so
sometimes if i'm trying to evaluate how
persuasive it is
i will skip the event and look at what
highlights came out of it because it's
the highlights that will
persuade or not persuade it's good to
see them without being biased by the
whole event
because the rest of the country is not
going to be biased that way they'll be
biased by
the clips this also assumes that anybody
who watches the entire event
has already decided right if you watch
that whole event
you're really into politics and you've
already made up your mind a long time
ago
so here's what i took from the
highlights
the the rnc is
really good at visual persuasion
like really good and i've never seen a
better
consistent example than how they
paired up now let me tell you all the
things they did right
number one i thought it was clever that
they
went second because correct me if i'm
wrong but wasn't it in 2016 it seems
like
the dnc the democrats went second
with their convention do i have that
wrong and that allowed them
to label the uh the rnc as
dark so you remember everybody says it
was dark
after uh after trump's first
twenty-six yeah 2016
uh convention and this time the rnc went
first
or the i'm sorry the dnc went first and
so the
republicans immediately after the dnc
do you know what they said they said
that
they said it was dark so the republicans
and trump actually used this too
cleverly got out there first and called
the democrat
vision dark you all heard that right and
i laughed every time i heard it because
what they were doing quite obviously
is they were softening up the message
that they knew was going to come from
the other
the other way the republicans knew in
advance
that no matter what they did the
democrats were going to say well that's
dark
that's a dark vision and i think they
don't have expert help this time
in 2016 i said i think godzilla is
helping him because that word dark
just sounds a little bit too well
designed
professional but they're reusing it
it's four years later and they don't
have a better play than saying it's dark
so they signaled it from a mile away the
republicans co-opted it and said you
guys are dark
we're not dark you're dark and then of
course after the republican convention
you wake up and
what did all the democrats say about the
demo the republican
event it was dark
but doesn't it look stupid now don't
they
don't they look like clowns this time
because the whole dark thing is just so
overused
and didn't really fit the content the
the content really
i don't think was dark at all
so here's what um here's some pull
quotes
from the from stuff that the trump
supporter said
and i want you to feel how visual this
is okay
so i'll just give you some quotes that
were uh
important enough i guess that they were
pulled out for twitter and people were
mentioning them
so charlie kirk started out
and he said this line trump is the
bodyguard of western civilization
now think about that if he had said he's
the protector
of western civilization that's just a
concept
not bad but not really good but he said
he's the bodyguard
the bodyguard that's that's visual you
can see him standing there at literally
just guarding
all right so that's charlie kirk opening
i think he was the opening
speech then we get to uh matt gates
this is not in any particular order and
here's something
kate said he said donald trump like all
builders
is a visionary notice that vision is
actually part of it so he's
you know you're activating your your
visual part of your brain just by saying
that word
that which is built in the mind is even
more powerful than the brick and mortar
that holds it together
wow isn't that good writing
that's unusually good writing for
a speech but think of a visual that is
he's saying
what's built in the mind you see the
mind
and then is more powerful than the brick
and mortar and then you see the building
so you've seen the the vision of it in
the mind like a little movie playing in
the mind
then you see another you know visual of
the brick and mortar
very visual hard to forget um
gates went on to say president trump
sometimes raises his voice
into a ruckus now the first part of that
which i love is he's he's reframing
trump's personality if you will
into somebody who's necessary he's not
somebody who's just making a lot of
noise
he's raising a he's raising his voice
and raising
a ruckus ruckus is a good unusual word
it draws your attention to it
because people don't use ruckus too much
so when you see a word you know what it
means
but you don't see it often in this
context as you pause
that's good persuasion making you pause
in the middle of somebody's sentence and
and think about it that's good stuff
just nails you to the
the sentence and then case one he said
he
he says he knows what it takes to raise
an army of patriots
who love america and will protect her an
army of patriots you can see them
you can see them in your head can't you
you know what they look like
they're an army of patriots everybody
has their own
vision so you're not thinking exactly
the same thing
some of you are seeing a militia some of
you are seeing
your neighbors they just happen to be
armed or unarmed it doesn't have to be
armed
in this context um then uh
herschel walker said uh that this is
less visual but it was
it was just well done so hershel walker
apparently has been friends
with trump for decades and hershel
walker said he's personally insulted
that people would think he's had a
decades-long relationship
with someone who is a racist and then he
said he's seen real racism and donald
trump is not it
and i thought that is a really good way
to frame that
i don't know if herschel walker wrote
his own speech
he's a smart guy he probably did but
that is a really good way to phrase that
he is
personally insulted that's different
it's different than talking politics
when you talk personally
people respond to it differently than
when you're talking
politics concept republicans blah blah
i thought that was really strong then
here's more visual persuasion from
donald trump jr and this this one i
think
wins the evening if there's one you're
going to remember
uh listen to don jr's uh quote he said
job joe biden is basically the loch ness
monster of the swamp for the past
century he's been lurking around in
there
okay that is really good writing
because it's funny right anything funny
is going to get your attention
and more likely will be quoted the next
day
sure enough he wrote it funny
it was quoted the next day that's that's
a home run in persuasion if you can get
somebody to quote it
but he has this loch ness monster so
visual
you see the swamp you see the loch ness
monster
and then he uses the word lurking again
perfect writing for persuasion the word
lurking is not normally a again it's not
normally a political word
so words like ruckus and lurking
and loch ness monster when you when you
airdrop those into a political context
they're the things you remember because
they don't belong
it's it's like what thing doesn't belong
with the other things
loch ness monster that doesn't belong
there that's why you remember
it's perfect then how about uh
amy johnson ford she was a nurse
practitioner
and she was applauding uh medicare and
medicaid coverage for telehealth
now think about that they bring a first
responder
so you you when a nurse shows up
you imagine the nurse working right it's
visual
the moment a nurse shows up similar with
a military or a police officer or any
first responder
anybody who's a front line first
responder type
they they take you right to the scene
you know if somebody shows up in
uniform uh let's say it's a a
firefighter
you see a firefighter in a uniform your
brain is immediately transported to the
fire
you see the you see you see a little
movie in your head of
that person doing their thing so having
a nurse
just in general is a good good
persuasion
but she talked about the importance of
telehealth now telehealth is i don't
care what you say
about what you do or do not like about
president trump
with a stroke of a pen president trump
removed a useless and destructive
regulation
that was costing the united states a lot
and it was the restriction against
telehealth
you know having a video call with your
doctor that if the doctor was across
state lines
there may have been some other
restrictions there but
trump ran for office saying i'm going to
get rid of red tape
there is no better example than getting
rid of this telehealth
restriction it is the ultimate example
it never
never had a good reason probably was
just
because of some you know doctor special
interest group
but he just wiped it away and who is
complaining about
it who's on the other side saying oh i
wish we didn't have telehealth
nobody nobody that's exactly
what trump promised when he said i'm
going to get rid of the red tape
he didn't say i'm going to get rid of
things that some people like
and some people don't like he said i'm
going to get rid of stuff that's useless
shouldn't have been there got rid of the
telehealth
restriction who's complaining nobody
he actually launched an entire industry
with the stroke of the pen
let's get rid of this and see what
happens you've seen all the
advertisements for
new telehealth businesses they're just
popping up like crazy
and one of the most important changes in
the country
and it was just one stroke of the pen
and nobody else would have done that i
believe
i don't believe a democrat would have
done that
don't know but i don't believe it
all right um then also visual
trump had uh i guess it was a recorded
package where he was talking to
a number of freed hostages which caused
even the even the press and pundits who
don't like trump
when they when they saw him highlighting
how many um
hostages he's he's freed from various
regimes with
captured americans even his his
critic said okay we got to give you that
we got to give you that when it comes to
freeing hostages
american hostages that's one thing we
just have nothing bad to say about
he did do that and he apparently he's
done it
you know more aggressively and more
successfully than anyone since reagan
which is pretty awesome now think of the
power of this
now first of all that was visual as well
because the
the people who had been hostages and in
unfriendly countries
were sitting in the white house they're
sitting in the white house with the
president who who freed him
that is visual that hits you
right in the in the fields and here's
the important part
you know how important it is in the
military
when the military has this rule that
they don't leave anybody behind
you know if you're dead you're wounded
we're coming for you and
even if even if we get killed coming for
you
we're coming for you so that if you're
you know if you're part of that
you know that you're always part of it
you know you're not you're not the
person who got left on the battlefield
you're still part of it no matter how
separated you are
you don't have to wonder if they're
coming for you
right if you're in the military and
you're missing
you don't have to wonder if they're
looking for you they're looking for you
right so the president has created this
similar kind of thing with with the
hostages
he's made it clear that he will burn
down your whole damn country
if you don't let them let them lose and
i think
he makes it looks like he makes the
threat
look real now imagine you are put
yourself in the mind
of somebody in another country and you
get picked up by an unfriendly regime
and you're jailed you're all alone
you're all alone
in a in a prison cell in a foreign
unfriendly country
what did you think when obama was
president
you thought i might get out he might
care
he might not right that's what you think
you would hope he was trying to get you
out but you wouldn't have a lot of
certainty about it now imagine that it
president trump is in the second term
second term second term right
and you get picked up by another country
and you're all alone in a jail
what do you know here's what you know
that whole damn country is going to burn
down if they don't let you out
he will burn down the whole country
figuratively speaking
i mean he will he will take their
economy out
he'll he'll take their diplomats out
he will ruin them if they don't let you
and you're going to know that
you're going to be sitting all alone and
some sell
in some foreign country and you're going
to sit there knowing that your president
is dismantling that freaking country
until they let you out
that's powerful uh
here's some more stuff the mccloskeys
were
were featured of course that was
brilliant casting
because they they are visual again
there's nothing more visual than the
mccloskeys
holding their guns protecting their
territory
their home that was great now compare
that
to what the democrats offer
you saw spectacular visual excellence
if you compare that to what and the
visual part by the way was often in your
mind
the visual part wasn't just what you saw
on the screen
so what the republicans did right
if i can put this in a tighter package
what the republicans did right
is since the recorded kind of
non-live audience situation removes the
visual
and i don't know kinesthetic auditory
it takes all that stuff away because
there's no live audience
they replaced it with
uh mental visions
think about that they couldn't give you
so much on the screen
because the limitations of chronovirus
so instead
they made you think the movies when the
mccloskeys got up it was
you know because there's no live
audience and stuff ordinarily it would
be kind of a dead
a dead segment but because you remember
them you
imagine them you you see them with their
weapons
it's a movie so somehow the republicans
managed to show
movies while nothing was on the screen
except people talking that
ladies and gentlemen is good good
production so the whoever produced it
you know if if in fact they were
encouraging their everybody to
speak visually oh my god that's good
that's like as good as you can get
for the limitations that were imposed
and now look at one new york times
political reporter
the this would be a a counter
or a criticism of the rnc event last
night
and this i'm not even going to give his
name it's not worth it
but he's an anti-trumper it looks like
and he says if vernon jones quickly goes
to this quote the democratic party does
not want black people to leave their
mental plantations
so what the democrats have for a
complaint
is sarcasm no reason it's just eye
rolling
oh there they go again complaining about
uh black people being not well served by
the democrats
and i'm thinking that's all you have i
would expect something more like a
counter argument if they have no counter
argument they just give you sarcasm and
eye rolling
it's like uh looks like the republicans
are complaining because the cities are
burning down again
those old complaints about it's just
same old thing from those republicans
you're burning our cities you're burning
our cities
i'm thinking you're gonna have to do
better than sarcasm
because the republicans are just
bulldozing you right now
this is not a fair fight at this moment
the republicans have like this army of
bulldozers
coming at you and the and the democrats
are responding to an
army of bulldozers with eye rolling
there they go again that's all that's
typical
that's it they got nothing all right
so we've got one
one side in the political spectrum is
opposed
to burning our own cities that would be
the republicans if you're paying
attention
the democrats appear to be on the side
of the people who are burning the cities
i don't think that plays very well
burning your own cities putting your own
people
out of work doesn't feel like a good
political thing to side with
and yet i was seeing a tweet from joel
pollock
and he was mentioning that uh that biden
did not condemn
the rioting and stuff of last night and
i'm thinking
you need to condemn that or you are not
even close to being qualified to be the
leader of this country
if you can't condemn setting on fire the
stores of innocent people
and breaking cars and setting things on
fire if you can't condemn
that you are not qualified
but worse well we'll get to worse in a
moment
did you see the video of the homeowner i
think it was in milwaukee
who when the crowds uh came near his
his home or their home in the suburbs he
fired a warning shot
did you see that so i guess it was a
black lives matter
riot slash protest more like a riot i
guess
that came into this guy's neighborhood
he walks outside with it
with some kind of a weapon it just fires
off a warning round
and then you watch all the everybody
scurry back into their cars like all
right run run he's got a gun he's got a
gun
and i thought to myself what is the law
on warning shots can somebody can
somebody give me a fact check on that
i imagine it it varies by state
so if you're in wisconsin and you're in
a dangerous situation
you're a law abiding let's say it's a
legally owned gun
and you're on your own property is it
legal to fire
a warning shot yeah let's say the
warning shot is nowhere near the people
let's say you i don't know is it
dangerous to shoot it in the air
because that bullet's got to come down
somewhere right so it might be illegal
to shoot in the air
i don't know if he shot in the air he
could have shot you know he might have
just shot his own lawn just to make a
point
so what exactly is legal because i need
to know that
because i would i would shoot
i would fire a warning shot if my house
was you know was being uh
at risk and so somebody says the warning
shot is illegal
but uh i'd really like a a ruling on
that
yeah because wouldn't it matter how much
danger you're in
because i would think that if you're in
imminent danger a warning shot would be
the
um the preferred method versus shooting
at the people who are
threatening you so i guess it depends
yeah it's unsafe it's obviously unsafe
to fire in air so i would assume that's
illegal
so somebody says it's illegal to
discharge a firearm
in most places but what if it's
self-defense
you know does a warning shot fit under
self-defense
all right i have questions on that get
back to me on that
um now here's
something that's uh caught my attention
and i can't release on it
uh as you know i'm not a believer
in any kind of religious anything
but i can't help noticing
how many satanic coincidences there are
with
the joe biden campaign and they just
have to be mentioned
now again i'm not a believer but it's
becoming a weird
coincidence of how many things look
satanic
for example joe biden is in favor of
what he said bringing the light to the
darkness
and what is happening as he's speaking
as he's speaking
saying i'll bring the light to the
darkness
cities are actually on fire california
is on fire up in arizona and i'm
watching
the entire valley is full of smoke
because
some part of the phoenix area is on fire
so if you were satan
wouldn't you expect the satan would
speak in terms which are
true but misleading meaning
he will bring you the light but there's
a catch
it's fire and it's burning your stuff
that's exactly what satan would say if
satan existed
now i'm not saying that that joe biden
is possessed by satan
i'm just saying it would look exactly
like this now are there any other clues
well how many people or entities do you
know
who prefer to live underground
i can think of satan living in hell
and who would be another person
who prefers to live underground
could it be basement dwelling biden
i only know two people who are famous
for living underground
can you think of even a third one i
don't think so
i don't think so so but that could be a
coincidence right
i mean you know there are coincidences
so if there was anything to this satanic
thing you would see
lots of little hints because don't they
say that that
satan uh his biggest trick is telling
you he doesn't exist
so you would he would be hiding in plain
sight
but there would be lots of clues if you
were not blinded by
the satanic influences for example
um what is joe biden's uh slogan
build back better build back better
bbb if you were going to imagine
6 6 6 and you wanted to
show it to people and disguise it at the
same time
can you think of any letter that the
numeral
6 would fit inside completely
only capital b capital b
is the only letter that you could put a
6
on the inside of it and it would be
concealed
if you put a 6 over the number 1
you'd say hey why'd you write a 6 over
the number 1 it would be obvious
but you could hide a 6 in a capital b
could be a coincidence how about the
name
joe biden well there's no six six six
there right
so joe is that's you know three letters
biden is five you know so there's no
symbolism there
except i was looking at a little bit
closer
and do you know if you took the capital
letter j
just imagine the capital letter j in
your mind now think of the next letter
in joe
it's an o now just move in your mind the
o
to the left until it's on top of the j
it's a backwards six so that's the j and
the o the form of backward
six now suppose the next letter
is these the lowercase e
what does a lowercase e look like
if you turn it upside down well it looks
like a six
so you got the j and the o together if
you combine them it looks like a
backwards six
you've got this lowercase e that looks
like an ups
upside down six but that's just two
sixes
six six wouldn't be anything right but
the next letter is capital b
for biden and capital b is where you
hide your six
so even j o e b
is 666 but then you say to yourself
scott scott you can find a pattern in
anything how do you explain
the rest of the word biden like you know
it's easy if you just if you just cherry
pick
if you just cherry pick you know
you know you can get that but what is
the what what is left
of the word biden if you take out the b
because that's where the six is hiding
what's left of the word biden are you
ready for this
i d e n i d
e n identity
6 6 6 identity
that's what joe biden's name actually is
666
identity now you say to yourself scott
you could pick any complicated situation
and you can find all these random
patterns and it's been proven a million
times and i say yeah
i agree they're like i'm not saying that
he's possessed by satan i'm just saying
there are a lot of coincidences so let's
look at kamala harris for example
kamala harris um
you'd you'd be looking for the same sort
of thing so what how many letters
are there in kamala k-a-m-a-l-a
well six but what are the odds that that
means anything how many letters in
harris
h-a-r-r six
all right so that but that's just two
sixes right
two sixes means nothing and that's just
a coincidence
what is she running for vice president
of the united states
so kamala harris
vice president of the united states is
three sixes
um is that a coincidence
be could be so there's one
there is one uh candidate joe biden
who has a coincidental association with
the number six six sex
in a variety of ways he lives
underground exactly like satan
and he talks exactly like satan telling
you he'll bring you good news but it's
really a trek
of language that it's bad news is he
bringing you the light
yeah yes your house is going to burn
down
you're welcome for all the light
so i'm just putting that out there uh as
i said
i'm not a believer so i don't believe in
either
religion or satan i'm just pointing out
there's a lot of coincidences going on
that's all i've got a final thought to
you
for leaving you today and
it goes like this what happens
when a billion chinese are put on work
by american robots
because oh
i'm seeing a lot of you are getting into
the
getting into the looking for clues on
the biden campaign you're going to find
a lot more of them when you start
looking
[Music]
but it seems to me that the future looks
like this
the us is uh wisely you know decoupling
from china and pulling back
manufacturing
as quickly as it can and
eventually our robots will be replacing
jobs in the united states
but at least we'll have a big robot
business you know the
whoever owns the robots will get be
getting rich
so there might be something producing
money that if you
taxed or had a ubi or something we could
get by
but what happens in china what happens
in china when they lose a billion jobs
to robots
because they can't make stuff for other
countries because we can do that
our robots will be more efficient than
their their humans
so if we replace low-cost labor
with american robots the america is
going to
be looking pretty good but china is
going to have a really big problem
because even if they try to make robots
for themselves and of course they will
and even if they try to use them all
they're going to be doing is putting a
million chinese on a business or a
billion
and a work so i don't know if china can
go crazy with robots the way that we can
in the united states
so my my prediction is
that china is doomed they're largely
doomed
and i think technology is going to be
the cause of that
and decoupling from them so that we can
keep our
intellectual property and our technology
with us
the united states is probably one of the
most important things that will ever
happen
in the united states in the history
maybe in the history of humankind
it will be one of the most important
decisions which
candidate will guarantee that we
continue our decoupling with china
it's not biden biden's been very clear
that's not his goal
trump has been very clear that if we
don't get a lot more than
what we're getting from china and we're
not going to we're not going to get
anything we want from china
um that he'll decouple and he will
he will do it so
uh i think china has got a lot of
problems coming
and it's gonna be robots that take them
out
all right somebody says there's no light
in biden's eyes well he's very squinty
i call him uh angry squinty caring
joe the caring being the part we can't
be sure about but he tells us that
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
