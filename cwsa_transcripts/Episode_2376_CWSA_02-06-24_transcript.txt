good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization oh
we're going to have some fun today and
it's not because the show is better than
usual but it really will be it'll be
better than usual it's because the news
is so delightful today a lot of funny
stories crazy stuff but if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
people can't even imagine with their tit
human brains all you need is a cup or a
mug or a glass a tankered chalis with a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopam mean end
of the day the thing to makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go quite perfect better than normal
above average
well let me catch you up on the news uh
there's a leaked video of uh musical
star
Drake who uh if you were to believe that
the video is
real appears to be pleasuring his a
gigant uh male
member uh while somebody surreptitiously
films it now by coincidence his own
phone is in front of his face so there
is no part of Drake which I recognize
I'd like to go on record and saying that
if I see a video of allegedly Drake and
the only part of it I can see are his
feet and his penis I'm going to say I
can't tell that's Drake now for me I
would have to see a little bit of his
face but apparently for just about
everybody in the media seeing his
exposed penis was enough to identify
him which raises many
questions how many people have seen
Drake's
dick but now that I've seen it I think
I'd recognize him next time I see one so
I'm glad we all caught up on that now
you probably heard a story about uh
Biden uh and the story was told wrong um
I'll try to correct that the story was
that he mixed up the names of the leader
of France and that instead of saying uh
mcon he accidentally referred to Mand
who's been uh dead since
1996 now the way it's being reported is
Biden is old and he mixed up a name and
that's not not so different than things
that Trump's done Trump mixed up Nancy
Pelosi and K Harris or no and uh Nikki
Hy look at me mixing up names it's like
I'm 100 years old anyway I don't think
this is a story about mixing up names I
have a different Theory I believe that
Biden is now so close to death and he's
gone so far toward the light you know
down the tunnel that's what they say you
go down the tunnel toward the light I
feel like he's about three qus down the
tunnel and he could actually see the
dead
people so he didn't mention
deal but I think he can see him so maybe
not forgetting names so much is now
about 3/4 down the tunnel and just
passed the light you can see some of his
old friends back there that's what I
think I mean I'm just speculating but
that's what it feels
like well ex president Trump has offered
to replace Biden for the Super Bowl
interview which traditionally is the
sitting president but we have a sitting
president who heard the opportunity that
he could speak wherever he wanted to
and could say it in front of the biggest
audience in all of America the Super
Bowl audience and the cting president
said no
thanks and it's totally because he
doesn't need to
right no we have a sitting president who
literally can't do a TV
interview it's too dangerous
politically that's a real thing that's
happening right in front of us now
there's no other explanation for it am I
right has anybody offered a second
reason why he might not want to do the
interview which would be the biggest
audience in America who's already you
know at least half of them are in a good
mood H I don't know I feel like they
stopped trying to explain it you know it
used to be well he's got covid so he's
going to stay in his basement you know
there was always a cover story but
there's no cover story on this one is
there this this is just absolutely
transparent he cannot do this interview
he just doesn't have the
ability so Trump cleverly says that he
uh he'll do the interview and he says
it's quote ratings
gold now wouldn't you be
disappointed if you found out that Biden
wasn't going to do this traditional
interview because I guess there was long
history of of this uh and that you'd be
so disappointed if Trump didn't offer to
do it and say it was ratings gold if he'
only just offered to do it I'd be like
and and it'd be like there's something's
missing it's like I think I'll do the
interview
and is ratings gold there it is there it
is that's the Trump we're waiting for is
ratings
Gold All right so there's a new
censorship Scandal I mean there's so
many of these government censorship
scandals they're all starting to run
together in my mind the the stories that
I hate are there's a new twist in one of
the lawfare trials against Trump oh God
am I have going to have to understand
which one it is and which corrupt da it
is and which charges I don't
want to have to figure this out again
because none of us seems real it just
all seems like so like
you know it's like I literally I'm
sifting through to find the
better
 like it's just it's hard to
talk about some of these stories but
there's another big one representative
Jim Jordan's posting about it and I
think Mike Benz is taking a Victory lap
for being uh you know the one who
brought this to our
attention and this is what happened
apparently the National Science
Foundation uh NS
uh they had massive funding from the
government to develop all these AI
automated tools for censoring online
speech as
scale so the US
government was massively funding an
organization to suppress political
speech on the other side now they don't
call it that they call it suppressing
misinformation but the things that we
know they were suppressing were at least
half of it was true you know they may
have actually suppressed things that
were not true as well probably but
probably at least half of the important
things were actually true when they
suppressed them or tried
to so there is a total information that
our government has tried to do the very
thing our our constitution says not to
and the way they did it was by funding
uh entities that we couldn't tell were
doing it or were inside the government
so they did everything they could to
thwart the Constitution of the United
States not for a good reason either it
looks like it's completely political it
doesn't look like there was any even
intended National benefit at
all all right let's talk about uh Comm
Lis and gas lighting on the economy so
I'll give you a very brief economics
lesson here just how to understand when
the government is talking about how the
economy is
doing now I've told you uh even before
the pandemic I think I told you that if
there's one thing you get right you'll
be okay and that's employment as long as
the employment numbers are good it's
really hard to follow into fall into a
recession you know get into a depression
or anything like that so you could have
a lot of things going wrong but as long
as the jobs are looking good you're
going to be in better shape however that
rule just
changed and the Biden Administration is
I think taking advantage of the fact
that people don't know that rule changed
every other time if you said employment
is good it was 85% of the whole story
everything else would also just be
good
but uh in the face of massive
unaffordability which will be the
keyword unaffordability or AFF ability
problem um people are taking two
jobs so if people are taking two jobs
because they can't afford things that's
not a win but it would show up as you
know jobs opening and jobs being filled
and stuff like that the other thing you
need to know is uh if your government
does not tie what the government does to
the outcome they're just bragging about
somebody else's accomplishment so yes uh
there lots of jobs jobs were created
that will get revised down maybe but
lots of jobs were created so what was
the policy that Biden did to create
those jobs go name the thing that Biden
did that you can connect to creating a
job I'm not aware of anything
infrastructure Bill the the one thing
that they talk about what was it uh I
mean seriously what was
it I'm not aware of anything that they
did that would have some direct effect
on jobs so why is he why is he claiming
Victory on something he actually
literally didn't even work on it
yeah so if anything he's made it harder
to get a job for white people for the
Dei stuff
anyway so when you hear that jobs are
good is true it would have also been
true under
trump it will always be true that if
you're coming off a pandemic you know
there's going to be some depression from
the pandemic that takes a few years to
dig out of and you should expect you
know better you know sort of a a little
bump in employment and stuff like that
just because you're coming out of a
situation like the pandemic so first of
all the numbers are weird because of the
pandemic um number two it probably would
have been exactly the same if you'd
replaced them with any president and
there's no there's no particular policy
nor does she claim it the there's no
claim being made that because we did
this we got this outcome they're trying
to make you think that he did
things and they call it
biomics what was it what what was the
thing just name it and then connect it
to the the things you say are going
right and then tell me why that wouldn't
have happened if any other president had
been
there all right um the other thing is
the stock market and the GDP are up do
you you know why the stock market is up
and the GDP is
up probably because of
inflation inflation yeah the stock
market is just adjusting to inflation
and the GDP is just adjusting to
inflation so if you have inflation those
two things go up but it's not good news
but how much of the public knows that if
you were to do a uh you know a survey of
the public how many of them could tell
you that they do understand that the
stock market and the gross domestic
product go up just because the price of
stuff goes up it's not because you're
doing better I mean we might be doing
better but it would go up because of the
you know any price
increases she also says we have the
strongest economy of Any Nation now it
might be true but is that telling you
what you want to know wouldn't you want
to know what direction is moving suppose
we started with the strongest economy
which we had and suppose it got
weaker but everybody else you know was
not doing so well so that weakness
didn't put us below anybody else would
you brag about that no so literally this
could be bad news but it would be
expressed in the same words we're doing
better than other countries we were
doing better than other countries before
we've always been better than other
countries you know economy wise so and
depends how you measure it you know um
I'm sure there small there probably some
small country that is doing better
but that's a that's a spin there um she
says we have historically low black
unemployment do we is the black
unemployment better now than it was
under
Trump what do you
think I I thought that Trump had the the
record and then she also said that uh
historically low
unemployment that's just just untrue
isn't it I thought Trump had I thought
Trump's numbers were better but to be
fair it was before the
pandemic so if I'm using the you know
the same Fair rules I'm using for Biden
I would say that you know Trump's
numbers before the pandemic you know
can't be compared to really anything
else but my understanding
is that's the
situation so let me let me summarize
so she's got uh here are
reasons uh strongest economy of Any
Nation she's leaving out what's
important which is did the gap between
how strong we were and how others were
shrink or grow so that's just
misdirection we have historically low
unemployment and historically low black
unemployment rate I believe those are
just lies because I think I think Trump
had better numbers there uh wages have
outpaced inflation
I believe that's just not
true am I wrong I this is not true um
consumer confidence is up is that true
do you think consumer confidence is
up yeah I think so no I think it is I
think it is not
everybody but you know why consumer
confidence is
up the news and the politicians have
been telling you for months that they
think that the news has not done a good
enough Job saying how great the economy
is so the news that works for the
Democrats decided to tell you how great
the economy was over and over again
until the public said oh well I didn't
realize that but it must be good for
other people because it doesn't look
good for me but if the news says it's
good for other people yeah so she's got
let's see one
misdirection three
lies and one consumer confidence claim
that's based on brainwashing that they
did and that's her claim for the
economy uh misdirection three lies and
uh something that they they gain through
propaganda that's not based on their
reality and inflation helped the GDP in
the stock
market and there's no connection to any
uh any policies so here's a question
tell me if you've ever seen this asked
as Steve Ducey or anybody else said uh
the economy does have some good points
to it as you've mentioned which policies
are the ones that cause those to
happen is it the open borders that help
the employment numbers do so well was
that the open borders that caused uh
black unemployment to be
low I feel like his policies should be
working against all of these things it's
just that they haven't worked against
them long enough and hard enough so all
right so Matt Gates is doing something
very clever that I approve
of he's introducing a resolution to get
people on record uh saying that Trump
did not engage in an Insurrection or
Rebellion against the United States so
the idea is to get members of
Congress especially Republicans to go on
record
officially to say do you think that was
an
Insurrection God I love that I just love
it because here's the thing you're
probably thinking to yourself you know
it's some kind of uh Trump loyalty test
that that's how the news will say it
it's a loyalty test because if you're
not willing to say that you're you're uh
you know orange Cheeto Jesus uh is
innocent of all charges then you can't
be a Republican look in right that's the
way it'll be
spun here's the other way to look at it
this is my way to look at it this is an
IQ
test it's an IQ test if you think that
January 6 was an Insurrection
today
today you're a
idiot that's the end of the story and I
would love to get a list of all the
idiots and this is really useful because
if you can get this you know into
practice you know I don't know what it
takes to make a resolution happen but if
he could get everybody to sign up
whether they they are so dumb
that today they actually think that was
a an Insurrection or Rebellion I do want
to know them I want to know their
names don't you want to know the names
of somebody who would be this dumb
because that's too dumb to be an elected
official that should be the end of your
career if you believe it at this point
that should be the end of your career
and if you vote for the the Border bill
that should be the end of your career
but that's a separate we'll get to that
so yeah I love Matt Gates giving it an
an IQ test to
Republicans um so Nikki Haley is applied
to get to Secret Service protection CNN
reports now you might say to yourself
does she really need Secret Service
protection she might because you know
there's a lot of a lot of
political you know a lot of political
action that could turn physical and so
I'd like to see her get secret service
protection but not unless JFK that or
RFK does if RFK Jr doesn't get any
Secret Service protection then I got to
say no I got to say no you got to do
them both both or none because if you're
going to be this obvious about who you
want to live and who you want to get
shot uh that's no good yeah you're going
to have to at least hide it a little bit
by giving them both protection or nether
of them protection but no way can you
give her protection and I him I mean
that would be
crazy so we'll keep an eye on
that they'll probably just ignore it um
here on the they always accuse you of
what they are doing contest so the AP
has a story about how uh Trump is super
sexist about Nikki Hy and here are the
evidence that Trump is the
sexist against Nikki Hy he called her
bird
brain um he said that she her dress was
not so
fancy and that once unrelated to uh any
of the Nikki Hy stuff in 2016 he was on
recorded video saying that he can just
grab them by the you know
what that's it that's the evidence
that Trump is the
sexist now let's compare that to what
Nikki hilly has said out loud in public
multiple
times if you need to if you need to get
something done call a
woman she said that directly which one
is sexist a normal insult that Trump
uses for every single person in the
world like bird brain or you know
whatever he calls everybody else the
most normal thing does so by insulting
Nikki hilly he is treating her exactly
the way he treats men and the AP said if
you treat her exactly the way you treat
men that's
sexist and they're actually trying to
sell that they're treating her the same
way he treats everybody is
sexist while she in front of everybody
says that you should vote for her in
part because she has a vagina and that
gives her an advantage over men who
people have penises you know knock
counting
trans yeah so this is such a perfect
example of they always accuse you what
they're doing Trump correct me if I'm
wrong Trump has never once said that a
woman would be less good at a job go in
any domain you know maybe you know
playing in the NBA or something but ever
has Trump ever said that uh in his in
his employment at Trump you know the
company Trump has he ever said that he
uh didn't think that the women could do
the job nope he's actually quite famous
for promoting women even way before it
was fashionable is that fair to say that
he was aggressively promoting women in
his
organization way before it was
fashionable true or false I think that's
just true
now and and never once as he uttered a
single word that you could interpret as
thinking that women would have some you
know lesser ability for politics or
running a big organization like his own
never not once but Nikki hilly says it
in public more than
once so this is the perfect example of
they always accuse you what they're
doing I don't think this one could be
any more clear now does Trump say does
Trump say uh offensive sounding things
when he thinks nobody's listening yeah
like every other person I've ever met in
my life like every person I've ever met
in my entire
life that's just how people talk when
they think nobody's
listening all right so the mayorcas
impeachment is going on now or
impeachment attempt well we don't think
that he will get impeached because
it seems to be closer to something like
an interpretation of policy than it does
look like breaking the laws or something
that would be impeachable but the
aggressiveness with which
he's let's say misinterpreting the
policies or interpreting them in a way
that is most negative to the United
States is very
concerning I don't understand why he
would given that you could interpret you
know various laws different ly why would
he always pick the worst
way is that a coincidence why would he
pick the way that's worse for the United
States when his job is to protect us and
I think that alone should be impeachable
if you can't explain why all the things
you do are bad for the United
States it ought to be
impeachable I mean I get that it's not
technically but I do like the fact that
he's going through the process so we can
all talk about him being impeachable
that's something you know at Le at least
it clarifies the situation for the
public yeah it might not be a law but
it's so bad that we think we need to run
him through an impeachment process
that's how bad it is because it doesn't
look like no it doesn't look like
incompetence no if you think this is
incompetence I think that's the last
possibility well Rob Riner continues to
entertain he had two posts
at different times uh one of them was
about Trump and he said uh I don't know
when but it must have been a while ago
he posted uh the only reassuring thing
about a pathological liar is when he
says something you know it's not true
and then he says there is no crisis at
the border now obviously uh Trump was
saying there was a crisis at the border
sometime in the past and so Rob Riner
wants you to know there is no crisis at
the border also Rob Briner later it's
uh it's simple Donald Trump and the
House Republicans don't give a flying
 about fixing our border
problems he said both of those
things now do you remember when you
thought he was just a serious citizen
who is involved in politics and you just
disagreed with
him now you know that's not what's
happening
right you can see it now
right
yeah yeah
you should not take him seriously as
even a person with an opinion it he he
posts like it's his
job like he just works for the CIA your
I think your working assumption is that
he's just an intelligence asset it
doesn't mean it's true but your your
working assumption probably should be
something reasonable if you think that
these are reasonable opinions by just
like a normal citizen it's clearly not
because there's such a disconnect
between what we know must be his
intelligence because he's very
successful with the way he talks it's
such a disconnect that there's no way
he's just being dumb all right there's
something else going on but my
assumption is it's just exactly what it
looks like it looks like somebody's
working for the Democrats or the CIA or
something don't know that for sure it's
just my working assumption
now let's talk about this border bill
that appears to be the worst thing
anybody ever did um Kyle bass and lots
of other people are weighing in on it
I'll just tell you what Kyle said but
you can see I don't know just dozens of
other people say my god did you read
what's in this bill it's the opposite of
what it's trying to do which is
generally the case usually our bills are
labeled the opposite of what they do all
right musk has been talking about that a
lot that we label them the opposite
so apparently part of this bill Believe
It or Not would Grant May orcus the
ability to Grant uh Asylum and even
American
citizenship at the
border without
review by
anybody including the intelligence
agencies so somebody could come in and
literally be a terrorist and may orcus
can say you're a
citizen and that would be the end of it
there would be no
review that's actually in this
bill yeah like like try to wrap your
head around that why would that be there
give me a reason why that would be there
there is no
reason this bill is clearly not designed
to help the United States all right and
and it's not not a Democrat or
Republican thing this is clearly
something else is going
on this is in the category of something
else is going on don't know what but
this is not a policy
disagreement if you think there's oh
we're being a little inefficient you
know it's a it's a or it's a it's an
election year so people being a little
more political that's not really what's
going on I don't know what's going on
but this is one of those situations
where we need to stop everything until
we figure out what's going on right
remember when Trump said quite
provocatively let's stop immigration
from certain countries until we figure
out what's going on his Instinct was
completely right because if you don't
know what's going on the first thing you
need to do is find
out how's that not obvious whatever is
happening with this weird border
bill
it's it's not based on policy
differences it's not based on
politics and I can't even follow the
money is you know I guess if they tie it
to Ukraine and Israel I can follow it
but if you were just look at the border
part by itself it doesn't make any sense
at all it doesn't make sense for
Democrats or Republicans I can't imagine
there would be one Democrat voter not
politician voter who would be in favor
of this bill if they knew what was in
it is that your take on it that not even
a republican not even a Democrat would
if they knew what was in it because
apparently the Democrats are just lying
to everybody about what's in it and
they're treating it like it's a solution
to the Border crisis it's not it's not
even in that realm it's literally making
it worse it's like legitimizing keeping
it as bad as it is it couldn't be worse
so
I think we should stop talking about it
like a policy
difference I feel that's we're as
Citizens if we allow them to tell us
that this is some kind of policy
difference then we've been completely
brainwashed this is not a policy
difference but I don't know what it is
we need to stop everything until we
figure out what's going on and I mean we
should not we should not consider even
voting on it one way or the other we
have to figure out how this happened in
the first place who put this on
paper I want to know what's behind this
because this
is I mean it looks like it's closer to
treason than it is to a policy
difference a policy difference would
have people disagreeing on the details
that's not what's going on they're not
disagreeing on the details they they
literally are being Bamboozled about
what's in it and it's clearly designed
to make things
worse that's not
politics that I don't even know where to
follow the money for that there's
something else going on they need to
shut the whole system down until they
figure what that is they shouldn't vote
at anything they shouldn't pass a budget
for anything they should shut the
government down because I don't want
more of
this you need to stop and figure out
what's wrong and then maybe figure out a
way to fix it but no yeah right now the
the current system would be
what the current system would either be
you know blackmail and threaten and
bribe people to vote for this piece of
garbage right that'd be the normal
process or go back and create a
Frankenstein 2 which will be every bit
as bad as this and then come back and
tell us it was fixed and hope enough
people are now desperate you know they
got to get that Ukraine funding they got
to get that Israel funding that they'll
just give up and vote for
it that's what's going to
happen there there either there will
either be some kind of force making
people vote for it because they want the
other things or they'll go back and
rewrite it
worse you know that right it's not going
to come back making sense it's not even
going to come back looking like a
Democrat plan at least that I'd
understand you might like it you might
not like it but at least shouldn't it be
at least consistent with what Democrat
voters would want I don't see the
Democrat voters
wanting open
borders at least by a majority and the
ones who think they want it are just not
the people who should be in this
conversation they're people who don't
understand it or I mean they're just
they're honestly their limited capacity
people let me say it as directly as
possible the only people who could be in
favor of the current situation on the
border are people have limited capacity
now that's a lot of
people limited capacity by that I mean
the
inability to see the short-term and
long-term of a fairly complicated issue
right immigration is simpler than some
but still a little bit complicated I
think that the only people who could be
in favor of this are low capacity people
this has nothing to do with
politics
um so and I would I would go further um
I know this sounds like hyperbole but I
would cancel the elections the
presidential
elections let me say that again because
I'm serious and I know you won't take me
S we should cancel the elections because
we don't have a secure system and no
matter who wins we're not going to
believe it you know that no matter who
wins the country won't believe it under
those under that one situation you need
to cancel the
election I'm going to say this as many
times as it takes so you know I'm
serious under the specific situation
that you know for sure and we do that
neither side will accept the result
because they won't believe the election
was fair under that specific situation
and on top of that a system which was
designed for for corruption it's not
designed to remove it right if we
designed it to remove corruption the
elections would be the same day no prior
voting it'd be on paper there'd be no
computers and everybody would look at
what's happening and we'd have the
result the same day we'd know how to do
it so if the Democrats don't believe the
system if it goes the other way and the
Republicans won't believe the result if
it goes not their way and we have a
system which very clearly and
objectively is is designed for fraud
obviously I mean it's really obvious we
should cancel the election until we fix
it now you're saying to me but Scott
that would mean Biden or k La Harris are
running the
country
yep that's exactly what I'm
saying because you're watching them
disintegrate right in front of you and
you might need that to understand how
bad this is you might need to watch
Biden try to be president while he's
just literally just drooling on himself
right because you know they're going to
push they're going to tell you he's
still okay I I want to tell them I want
to see the Democrats tell you he's okay
when he's just drooling on the
microphone right that's what I want I do
want that because I believe the Deep
state will keep the country running just
fine and if the worst thing is that we
don't give them money for Foreign Wars
because we're too incompetent and
everything's shut down fine
fine yeah let them work it out let them
just work it
out but we are not in the domain of
politics anymore we're the we're in the
domain of there's something wrong and we
got to figure out what it is it looks
like foreign
influence it's either foreign influence
or somebody is in charge of our country
domestically that we just don't know who
it is and we don't know why they're
doing it if we can't explain
Soros is funding every thing
that's bad for the country and that the
Democrats are just going give us some
more of
that there's something going on and I
say just shut it all down we might need
a constitutional convention in which we
just rewrite this because we
designed a system that doesn't work in
modern times I think the founders were
brilliant and they designed a system
that worked for few hundred years
but it doesn't work now and here's
why I think the media
brainwashing um machine got too
good the the brainwashing function got
too good and that's not something that
the early settlers could have understood
they would never have seen the
mainstream media coming the internet
they would have never seen you know the
massive censorship machine they wouldn't
have seen that so I think we need to
stop cancel the election cancel this
Frankenstein Bill immediately no matter
what happens I don't care what happens
in Israel I don't care what happens in
Ukraine I literally don't because
whatever happens is going to be horrible
it's just going to be some different
version of horrible and somebody else is
going to pay for it so if you're just
making me choose among the horribles
great you pay for it you pay for it if
it's going to be horrible no matter what
you pay for it why am I funding
your horrible choices you go
fund your own horrible
choices so cancel the election literally
literally do a constitutional convention
and figure out if we can come up with a
system where we can still have free
speech without government censorship
working through the Nos and all their
fake fact Checkers and the fake ADL and
the fake you know fake
everything um and just see if we could
rewrite it and May maybe not change
everything you know you don't want to
throw everything away you want to keep
the good stuff but we need something
something that deals with whatever is
happening because whatever's happening
is
new and not something the founders
contemplated and if we keep pretending
that the the problem is a policy
difference we're not even in the right
frame it's the wrong
frame look look at this bill you tell me
in all seriousness you think that the
the Border
bill was a case of policy
disagreement that's not even close to
what we're seeing it's not even in the
neighborhood of of even a little bit
smelling like it could be
true we're in some other different
domain here and I don't know what it is
we're going to have to stop everything
and figure it
out and if that means that Trump doesn't
get elected in November I'm I'm for
that it's just there there's no way he's
going to get elected under a current
system you know that right they're
either going to kill him or Drake the
election I mean it doesn't look like he
has a chance honestly so when I say we
should cancel the election if you're
thinking oh my God maybe Trump won't get
elected if they can't no it probably
didn't change that at all probably
didn't make any
difference you might see today a report
about election
Integrity that
uh could be really
interesting so there's something coming
if you haven't seen it yet so I'm not I
can't mention it because you might not
have seen it I don't know if it's out
but there's something coming
today on Election Integrity in
2020 that you're going to find really
interesting really really interesting
and let's just say it's exactly what you
thought it's exactly what you thought
appeals court ruled against Trump is
that
new what appeal appeals
court DC what they rule which which are
the many
things rejects his immunity bid oh yeah
I expected that though didn't we all
expect that the immunity bid wouldn't
work I know that that's not a big
surprise but I think a lot of the
challenges are just to delay things
until after the election oh actually
that would be a problem wouldn't it if
you cancel the election they have more
time to get Trump well that would that
would be an argument against it that
would definitely be an argument against
it all
right
um
so Kelly and Conway did a uh opinion
piece I think it was in the uh I forget
where maybe New York Times or something
doesn't matter and uh Kellan Conway said
that she thinks that Trump should pick a
person of
color not because of you know weird
diversity reasons but just because it
would help help the election you know
just a practical thing and she says she
would narrow it down so these are the
names that she's she's got in her list
uh
Rubio how many of you think of Marco
Rubio as a person of
color Marco
Rubio do you do you think Marco Rubio
would gain Trump even one vote because
he's a person of
color he wouldn't get one vote for his
ethnicity would he am I wrong about
that I don't think
so
uh
anyway I guess Marco Rubio I guess would
be the perfect example of the way I
think we should do things I love the
fact that I guess technically he'd be a
person of color but I can't think of any
time that Marco Rubio has ever talked
about it has he I mean maybe he has but
he hasn't he hasn't talked that up like
oh you know vote for me I'm a person of
color I mean I think he treats it like
it doesn't exist which which allows me
to treat it like it doesn't exist which
is how I want to treat
it so yeah I'm I'm going to give him
credit for that all right so she
mentions uh Rubio she says uh Tim Scott
Byron
Donald's and Ben Carson representative
uh Wesley hunt never heard of him who's
Wesley
hunt has anybody ever heard of
Representative Wesley hunt
from
Texas
yeah Mike's brother you're funny all
right and then she mentions F ramas
Swami uh now let's look at her list so
here's what I believe kellyan Conway is
doing when somebody randomly Who's
involved in politics writes a uh opinion
piece you might say to yourself oh
there's somebody writing an opinion
piece and I'll bet it will agree with
their side and all that but kellyan
Conway is not your average
pundit I believe and I would look for an
opinion on this from you as well I
believe that when she writes a piece
like this that this has a function to it
I believe that she's testing these names
on behalf of trump to see what kind of
reaction it gets does it look like like
that to you that all she's doing is
doing a focus group by putting it out
there and letting people talk about it
so in my view she would not have done
this unless Trump had already narrowed
it down to these exact
names so I think she's
signaling that it's going to be one of
these and then she's seeing how you feel
about
it now let's look at the list let's go
further Marco Rubio do you think that
that is uh would help Trump to have
another
Florida
guy I think I think Mark R Mar or Rubio
is you know obviously he's a strong
politician but I think he's a hard
no kind of doesn't make
sense yeah I just don't think he's not
going to get enough he's going to get
somebody who agrees with him and doesn't
get any extra votes I say no on on Rubio
even though he's a you know he's a solid
guy
uh Tim Scott another solid
guy you know and he he checks the you
know checks the box so everybody would
at least know he's a person of color I
think he's too
weak um I just think he's too weak I
think if you've got somebody like Trump
who's a certain age you're going to look
at the vice president as a they've got
to have the same power level right this
isn't like like um you know vice
presidents of old where you didn't
really need them to be as good as the
top of the ticket this isn't that this
is the one case where you need the vice
president to be as good as the top of
the ticket sort of like a Gore Clinton
situation which was
rare
um so how about uh Byron Donalds or Tim
Scott I would say that Byron Donald's is
not quite seasoned
enough I don't know what he's
accomplished exactly although he's
strong I mean his future looks right Tim
Scott I just don't think he's got the
gravitas like I just don't think he's
like the hammer that you might
need uh how about Ben Carson I think
Ben's too sleepy I just don't think Ben
has the fire to be a vice president and
certainly not you know he's a certain
age ET not B Carson uh Wesley hunt I
don't know anything about him so that
would
be that would be a pick if you didn't
want your vice president to make any
difference it feels like that would be
just the Larry Elder is a certain age
he's over 70 I don't think you want your
vice president to be over 70 that that
would be a bad choice um then you get to
vake here's what I
think to me it's seems obvious that
kellyan Conway is testing V what do you
think I don't think she's even really
testing the other names I think this is
literally just a test of aake if you put
him in a group of other uh is that
Wesley
hunt I feel like I may have seen him
before so does it feel like and I and I
think specifically she's testing v a
against the black
choices what do you think because the
real question would be uh if if Trump if
Trump picked a black running mate I
think that would everybody would say
okay that's you know to get some extra
votes and it might actually be a strong
play I could definitely see that that
would be a strong
play but you need somebody who's
credible I think Byron Donald's just
needs a little more seasoning you know
we just need to see him accomplish a few
more things he could be great in the
future he might be terrific um and the
others are a little light but when I see
the the boldness with which V you know
talks about what he would do when I see
that he went from nowhere to make such a
big dent in the election I mean for
somebody who was an unknown and when you
look at his
success um you know business success you
look at his Renaissance Man ability to
understand and lots of topics I feel
like this is an Easy
Choice what do you
think does it does it seem to you like
it just jumps out as the obvious choice
or am I just too I mean I am very Pro so
I can't pretend I'm unbiased but it
looks like an obvious
choice because the others are just going
to give Trump either a a
nothing or a little
bit I think V would have the potential
to give him more than any vice president
ever gave a candidate I think I think it
would be a legendary
combination and it would be the most
confident thing that Trump could ever
do you know some of you said that Trump
wouldn't handle the fact that V you know
is is a strong personality and he's so
smart I say opposite I think you're
reading Trump completely wrong I say
that Trump Lov loves Brilliance like he
runs toward it all the time he wants to
work with it he wants to compliment it
he wants to be around it he loves
Brilliance there's no way he doesn't
like V and VI likes him so that's the
other requirement right so to me it's
like a perfect combination really I I
doubt it could be better in my view and
it wouldn't have worked the first
election because Trump wasn't already an
experienced president but now that Trump
is an experienced
president V's perfect it just it just
fits in every
way um Senator
Massie was uh talking about
mayorcas destroying some records so
apparently this whole pipe bomb
situation you know the pipe bomb
situation there was a fake it turns out
fake fake pipe bomb uh near where K
Harris was uh at the DNC headquarters on
January 6 and there's lots of mystery
about why we didn't know things and
there's text messages that were
magically destroyed that would have told
us more and Massie is making the case
that mayorcas was the you know the top
boss when all this happened and it's a
records
retention
violation and that maybe it should be
researched now I'm not one who thinks
that records retention is the biggest
crime and that we need to get really
tough on
that whichever side it is it just
doesn't excite me
um but I have this question how many
times have Democrats destroyed records
and got away with it is is anybody
keeping a
record like yeah we know Hillary's
emails and Hillary's phones she bleached
bits and destroyed the phones but
correct me if I'm wrong aren't there now
several stories like that and they're
all Democrats
and it was all people who were caught
red-handed and then they deleted the
only thing that would get them in
trouble yeah all of the January 6
testimony deleted the the pipe bomb text
messages
deleted yeah the FBI deleting
stuff
yeah I don't know it's sort of telling
me that as a legal
strategy uh you should destroy any
records no matter how legally they've
been
requested it feel I feel like destroying
records is just a smart play at this
point because it keeps
working anyway Tucker is in Tucker
Carlson's in Moscow the word is that
he's already talked to uh Putin now of
course the hill uh is quoting the
guardian saying that Tucker said uh why
can't I root for Russia I rooting for
them do you think Tucker said
that do you think that the hill that
quotes the
guardian that quotes
Tucker said why can't I root for
Russia I doubt it but here's how you
should analyze this so the hill makes
the
claim but they don't support the claim
they port to the they point to the
guardian so I follow the link and the
guardian makes the claim and then I look
for the source so I can you know see it
for myself because obviously if you make
a claim like Tucker Carlson said he
supports Russia and there's a video
right it wasn't
there so the source that makes the claim
doesn't have a
video to show you where it came from
it's the news it's the
news that's a pretty big claim to not
have a little bit of evidence for now
I'm not saying that he didn't say those
words I just don't know the
context now I think at one point he said
he was joking or something I don't
know
but um it also raises an interesting
question why can't he root for
Russia it's actually a pretty good
question now that part he may have he
may have why can't
he I I asked that of myself I said all
right think of all the things that
Russia has done that hurt
me uh now think of all the things that
Ukraine has done that hurt me I feel
like they're very
expensive and I feel like they're the
reason that Russia might be a risk to
me because of Ukraine
so do I think that the Ukrainian
population would be bet would be worse
off under Russian
rule I don't know how would I even know
that now obviously if Russia took over
Ukraine they'd you know kill all the
leaders on day one but have those
leaders done a good
job and would the people in Ukraine find
that their economy started improving
right away because I don't see the
Russians complaining about their
economy Am I Wrong is there a big
Uprising in in Russia of people who say
our economy is bad
I don't think there is I think Putin has
like weirdly High approval so if the guy
with high approval that nobody's
complaining internally about his economy
wants to do the same for Ukraine which
was a corrupt Basket
Case what is worse for Ukraine letting
Russia
win I actually don't know I actually
can't tell if Ukraine is better off
letting their corrupt government steal
other money and drive them into poverty
and create Wars for no reason or would
they be better off if they just said
Peace they had a new leader who may also
be corrupt but it couldn't be any worse
than it is who doesn't start a war
because it's
Russia I mean he wouldn't start a war
with Ukraine because they would already
own it in that
place
um believe the original January 6 hoax
that's true he's already talked about
that yeah what people saw and believed
during the fog of War has no it's no use
for analysis yes people were had wrong
opinions when we didn't know anything
same with the
pandemic yeah you don't complain in
Russia oh we would know we would know
yeah you don't complain in the newspaper
in Russia but we would know you know
so um it's going to be fascinating so
what I would recommend is that uh Tucker
actually negotiate a peace deal with
Putin and
Ukraine does that sound
crazy well well let me ask you this
who's going to do
it you everybody knows it has to be done
am I right 100% of the public knows that
Russia and Ukraine has to talk and they
have to
negotiate what who else is going to do
it
Biden Biden's not Biden's not going to
do it
zalinski no
no I'm completely serious I realize it
would be illegal but we don't have a
real government so something's got to be
done now it would be very illegal for
private citizen to negotiate on behalf
of America but would it be wrong to
suggest what a solution would look
like would it be wrong for Tucker to
invite zalinsky and Putin uh to be in
the same room and work it out it'
probably be
illegal probably but if it was all
transparent I wouldn't care yeah now I'm
being a little bit you know just
provocative I don't think that Tucker
should negotiate a peace deal but who
but honestly no one else is going to do
it until until and if you know a trump
or republican gets office no one's going
to do it so if you want this thing to
end you should be rooting for tuer to
end it and by the way I think he
could because it's not that hard to do
just somebody has to be working on
it just somebody has to be working on it
that's it that's all that's the entire
thing somebody has to be doing it
because we already know what it looks
like Russia's going to keep the stuff
that they already
got because they're they're never going
to give it back so why would he even
have much question about it you know
there might be something about NATO blah
blah blah
but yeah I think T Tucker could
literally negotiate peace because nobody
else is doing
it and everybody wants it like if
everybody didn't want it then you it
would be crazy to say you know some some
news pundit guy could negotiate world
peace that would be the dumbest thing in
the world but in this very unique
case where not only do both sides want
it they want it desperately and they
also know exactly what it would look
like right Ukraine knows they're not
going to get those territories
back but now imagine imagine this
imagine Tucker goes in he goes how about
this you know I can't negotiate a peace
deal but let me just ask you why you
wouldn't do this why wouldn't you offer
Putin why wouldn't you offer to do a
referendum for the disputed areas and
then decide everything based on the
referendum you know make sure it's run
by some third party like Switzerland or
something so it's it's real but if the
citizens want to be Russian how about
they go where you know by majority how
about they get that and if there are
areas that are still disputed where the
population does not want to be Russian
by a majority we just go with
that and then you don't you don't make
the rest of Ukraine
NATO because it's too provocative now
did I just did I just solve the war yes
yes I just solved it now all it would
take is for somebody like Tucker to just
put that idea in Putin's head how about
this why don't you offer that a
independent let's say the UN runs a
referendum for who should be in charge
where and no matter what you don't do
any more NATO stuff because that's just
going to cause the fight now you say
Victoria Newland would not allow that
and you're
right but don't you want it on the
table don't you want it on the
table because if you start polling
America you're going to get a 90% yes on
that American voter do you think that
Russia and Ukraine should end the war by
polling the citizens in the disputed
territories and going with what the will
of the people requires
we might have the world's simplest war
to
end
except for the money launderers and the
criminals who have some other motivation
but you would probably need something
like an
85% public preference before you could
overcome whatever corruption is keeping
things the way they are now it would
just be too embarrassing to go against
85% of the public as well as you know
the publics of the disputed
territory I mean that'd be hard to go
against uh Scott Mings to understand
your history please this has been tried
that's a terrible
comment terrible
comment yeah the history does not
history does not um tell you what's
going to happen in the future history
does not repeat itself that is a myth
and as soon as you believe that you
can't do anything that that eliminates
your ability to think oh history repeats
itself so there you go yeah no
everything's different everything that
was true before you had a major war that
exhausted both sides just doesn't apply
everything that was true before U Russia
had total military control of those
places it's a completely different
situation you know that we we didn't
have a failed government where the our
government couldn't really be
productively involved in anything
everything's different so to imagine
that what would happen when everything
was different is your model for today it
doesn't make any sense at
all that no I don't need to know that
history I know a little bit of it I mean
I know enough to know it doesn't matter
all right um the post Millennium is
reporting that uh Canada ordered their
lockdowns based on fraudulent studies
and by fraudulent I think it means that
somebody did a study and said that uh
during the Omicron wave and this is
important during the Omicron wave when
it was already past the most dangerous
part Canada said they needed to keep the
lockdown because of the unvaccinated
people were causing the the spread of
the Omicron the
unvaccinated now the claim and I'm not
saying this is true or false because I
don't believe any of the science around
the pandemic the claim is that the the
statistics actually showed that it was
the vaccinated people who were spreading
the Omicron the
most and therefore the policy should
have been exactly the opposite and it
wasn't Justified to lock everything down
now the claim that the vaccinated people
were spreading at the
most do you believe
that
you
do
okay all right so here's what I'm not
claiming I'm not claiming that the shots
worked I I want you to hear me very
clearly I'm not claiming that they
worked no no no I'm claiming that you're
believing data that came out of the
pandemic and it's pretty stupid looking
like if you believe this you're really
gullible and by the way you might be
right right you might be right but if
you believed it because you heard it in
the news you really got to check
yourself this is not something you
should have believed it might be
true but don't believe it because the
data the data said
it here's
why almost everywhere where we collect
data when it
matters we can choose ways to collect
that that sell a story and we can choose
ways to collect it they give you the
wrong answer to me this looks obviously
like they collected it and got the wrong
answer now if you told me that there was
no difference between vaccinated and
unvaccinated I'd say oh well that
actually sounds
reasonable yeah that actually sounds
reasonable but if you tell me that the
people vaccinated had more
spreading I'm not going to believe that
like what are what are the odds that it
made it more likely you're going to
spread it do you think it's do you think
that maybe the people who are likely to
get it and get sick with it and know
they had it are the people who are weak
to begin with and more likely to be
vaccinated you don't think there's any
correlation between there's something
about the people who got vaccinated such
as I'm going to spend a lot of time with
other people so I better get vaccinated
what what do the people who didn't get
vaccinated have in
common they spend a little less time
around other
people and if and if you say that's not
true I say to you how do you know how do
you know if you don't know that that's
true or false then what do you then how
can you think that this vaccinated
people are more likely to spread it this
is the most ridiculous I've
ever seen in my life now I'll agree with
you that the vacine the so-called
vaccinations didn't stop the spread
certainly during Omicron it made no
difference at
all so I'm not supporting the science
hear me clearly I'm not backing the
science I'm saying that you believe the
science so I'm saying that you believe
the
science
why like why would you believe
it either way if it told you that the
vaccinated were more likely or if it
told you the opposite why would you
believe it
there is no there's no data from that
era that's
believable and this is opposite of what
makes common sense and it's also fairly
opposite why this number would be wrong
because there's something about the
vaccinated population that is
substantially
different from the unvaccinated they
they have a very different character I
mean if the only thing you did is say
City people are more likely to be
vaccinated than country people is that
true you tell me
true or false City people more likely to
be vaccinated than rural people yes or
no well Republicans are more rural City
people are
more Democrat if that's the only thing
you knew wouldn't you assume that more
Democrat City people are vaccinated
right now what where are you more likely
to catch a a virus in the country on
your
Ranch or in the city where you're
surrounded by infected people all day
long do do you think that this
study adjusted for the fact that they
unvaccinated have a uh more less dense
lifestyle because they're more rural
people if they're
Republicans now are are you hearing this
for the first
time that this number couldn't be
trusted because there's something deeply
different about the unvaccinated
population
yeah
so don't believe anything about numbers
that come out of the the pandemic
they're they're all motivated numbers
even if they agree with you and even if
they're right even if they're right so
keep in mind I'm not I'm not eliminating
the possibility that it's
true but you shouldn't think it's true
because there was some
study if you think it's true because
there was a study or there somebody
corrected a study from wrong to right
it's like you learn nothing during the
pandemic none of the data is
useful at least believable none of
it all right Ian Bremer and some others
were talking about all of Biden's
foreign policy wins uh here's here's the
list of things which Biden could brag
about he kept NATO strong apparently
Japan and South Korea were having a
tough time with each other and uh it was
getting tense but uh Biden
Administration got them to to talk and
it seems like tensions have gone down so
that's good um then also the China
tariffs are still in place the other
Trump tariffs so not much change there
and that's considered good and then uh
Biden negotiated to get China to stop
sending fenel uh precursors to the
United States so that's all good
right right you're not going to disagree
with me are you so look at all these
winds then he also stopped the China
from harassing American aircraft Big Win
there so that's pretty strong look at
this list I'll read it again he kept
NATO strong he got Japan and South Korea
to get together I think Ian bremmer said
you know that was as substantial or
somebody did that was as substantial as
the uh the Abraham Accords you know what
wasn't much in the news but real big
deal so big win there for Biden and uh
those the the fenel you know stopping
stopping the fenel that's a pretty big
deal and then stopping the Chinese haras
so that's that's all of his big wins
it's pretty good huh let's take a look
at this keeping NATO
strong am I wrong or did Trump get NATO
its biggest funding of all
time the argument here is that uh Trump
kept saying is NATO
useful he should keep saying that he
should say that about literally
everything we give money to do we still
need these bases in other countries
maybe but he should ask that question do
we still need to give money to this or
that I don't even care what this or that
is maybe you should ask that question
maybe you should put them on their heels
and say I'm not so sure I should give
you any money you tell me why I should
give you some money to me that's a
better way to handle things so if
somebody's interpreting that Biden's got
the better handle on things things by
telling them by telling NATO they can
have anything they want and we'll back
them that feels like
stupid so are we are we calling his
accomplishment something that in my
opinion looks just sort of stupid it's
bad negotiating to say nato all good
take our money NATO all good no you got
to make them prove it you better you
better make sure that they're doing
something we want to spend their money
on and you should have them on their
heels all the time that's just basic
leadership how about uh that Japan and
South Korea thing see that that's
something that no other Administration
would be able to handle
right how the hell hard was it to get
Japan and South Korea to not start a war
I don't think that was the highest level
of difficulty if you're going to compare
this to the Abraham
Accords
seriously seriously now I know know that
Japan and South Korea have a you know
long long history but I don't feel like
the level of difficulty there was too
high just sort of had to get him in the
same room all
right big deal uh then what about the
China tariffs well literally that's
something Trump did and just Biden
didn't break it but then the part about
he got China to agree to stop sending
fenel you know that didn't happen
nothing like that
happened it's the same thing that Trump
did and Trump said stop sending and they
said oh yeah sure yeah we're trying as
hard as we can yeah no nothing is
happening on fentel so to imagine that
you could just throw this in the story
like it's as biggest
accomplishment none of it's happening
it's not even
real and what about stopping the Chinese
harassing American
aircraft is that an
accomplishment no because they wouldn't
have even done it if Trump had been
president Am I Wrong Trump would have
just said once is too many just stop
that and I think they would have stopped
so these are the this is the weakest
list of
international uh you know and then it
forgets that he's involved in several
Wars
wow
anyway uh I've got a solution for the uh
the Red Sea
it's kind of
obvious so you know the
hoties around there are shooting
missiles and
stuff and we uh think Iran is behind all
of it of
course and Iran has some ship uh called
the bashad that's in that area that we
think is uh part of their you know their
spy bad operation and that is uh giving
some kind of intelligence to the hoodies
to know what to shoot maybe or doing
some other bad
things some have called it a floating
Armory so it's basically a military you
know serious military ship in the Red
Sea H but Iran has said that the purpose
of that ship here's good news is to uh
it's an anti-piracy
ship so the the point of the ship is to
stop all that
piracy meaning the hooes so it's an
anti-piracy thing so good news right it
Ran's on our
side yeah here we thought they had been
funding the hooes and they were all
happy about the missiles coming and and
bothering us but no it turns out Iran
says that uh they they don't like the
piracy either so they got their own ship
there to deal with
it do you see the solution yet or do I
have to connect the dots let me tell you
a little story that might allow you to
connect the dots do you remember once
there was a a Russian Pipeline to Europe
sort of a gas pipeline and then sadly it
blew up it blew up well sad and then we
blamed uh I believe we blamed Putin for
blowing up his own
pipeline well later we found out that
might not have been exactly
true but it makes me
wonder assuming that we take Iran at its
word and why wouldn't they they've never
lied to us before and they say that
there it's an anti-piracy thing you know
who would not like that you know who
would really not like an anti-piracy
ship right in that red sea area the
hooes and imagine if the hoties decided
to fire a missile and destroy that
ship I mean imagine because that was
that's exactly what the hoodies do yeah
that they'd want to they'd want to get
back at anybody who's trying to stop
their piracy and their bad intentions
there so I think you know just in the
same way that Putin destroyed his own
pipeline we might find the hoodies
attacking those Iranian ships and that
would be terrible I mean that would be a
tragedy so you maybe the hoodies can
take out those Iranian ships and maybe
that will
solve the problem we've done it
before no I don't think that's a good
idea but it's funny because we've done
it before it would be totally in
character for us to to syn their ship
and say I don't know it's the hoodies
we're doing what we can but we can't
stop every missile and we and and if you
if you
believe if you think that's going to
happen watch for the cat on on the
roof look for a story that would be a
fake story that says it looks like those
hoodies fired a missile at the Iranian
ship but luckily an American ship
intercepted the missile and shot it down
because we don't want war you know yeah
yeah we don't want war so we're we're
going to protect that Iranian ship from
those damn hooty
missiles that's the way I'd play it so
if you see that it sounds like we're
going to protect the Iranian ship from a
hoodie missile we're going to sync that
ship that that would be the hint that is
coming all right ladies and gentlemen
