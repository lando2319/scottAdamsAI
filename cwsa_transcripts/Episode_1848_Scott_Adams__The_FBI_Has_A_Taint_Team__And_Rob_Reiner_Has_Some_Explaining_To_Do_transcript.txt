good morning everybody
and congratulations
for making it to the highlight of
civilization coffee with scott adams it
doesn't get any better than this
even though it might it might i'm joking
it could it could actually get better
than this it's hard to believe but
possible
now is anybody here uh feeling a little
low on the fascism scale would like
would anybody like to take it up to a
full
semi-fascist estate
then all you need is a
copper bug or a glass attacker chelsea
style canteen sugar flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dope meaning of the day it's
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now
go
have you ever heard that there's such a
thing as too much of a good thing
it's true
did you know that if you take a little
bit of botox which in a larger dose
would be a poison
but if you take a little bit of botox it
can make your wrinkles go away
right so something could be really bad
for you if you get a lot of it
but if you get just the right amount it
could be good and so that's why you
should not dismiss being a semi-fascist
i think we could all agree that being a
fascist would be a bad idea
just as we could all agree that taking
an overdose of
you know
botox would be a bad idea too
but if you get just the right amount
it gives you a little flavor
just a semi-fascist
just enough just enough
well if you didn't know that's what uh
biden has called many of the trump
supporters
he's called them ultra mega
semi-fascists
ultra mega
my semi-fascist
which
again is just the right amount semi
all right
so i read yesterday that the fbi has
something called a taint team
t-a-i-n-t
the taint team
now you're probably saying to yourself
scott you're making that up
they don't really have a team called the
tape team
no they do and they really do
it's called the date team
now if you're wondering what does it
take to qualify for the tape team
well i don't know for sure but
based on the name
uh you don't want to be a butthole
if you're a butthole you cannot be on
the teen team
if you're a dick
now if you're being a dick you can't be
in on the tainting
but if you're somewhere between a
butthole and a
dick you're perfect for the tate team
the teen team is ready for you
now just a clarification
the teens team has nothing to do with
andrew taint
andrew taint uh has been cancelled by
social media and quite effectively
cancelled i would say he's been he's
been erased from history
uh but that's pronounced differently
andrew taint
is pronounced and spelled differently
that's t-a-t-e and that's pronounced
taint and that's different than the fbi
taint team
pronounced taint
so keep those straight
well um you know those mar-a-lago
nuclear secrets that were going to
destroy the world if anybody saw them
it turns out um
it's it's not so much about
nuclear secrets
it's you know we haven't ruled out
nuclear secrets we haven't ruled it out
but it's probably
not so much about that
now today the news is it's more about
because the affidavit got released with
redactions
it seems to be more a problem of
documents
it's a document control problem
not so much a problem that they were
secure documents or not so much a
problem that they were secret
although they might have been we don't
know but it's really a problem of
documents
now
you knew this was bad didn't you
as soon as you heard this story you said
to yourself oh god this is bad
this is bad mar-a-lago documents
but now that we've gotten to a little
bit closer to the bottom of it
people
i was worried about the
pandemic i was worried about a nuclear
war with putin over ukraine
i've been worried about the supply
chains i've been worried about the food
this fertilizer
i've been worried about
inflation
but nothing
nothing comes to the level
of documents
people
i i don't know how to say this
in a way that doesn't panic you
trump
had documents
i know
i know calm down calm down
if you need some um any kind of therapy
you should get it you might need to talk
to a professional but trump
and this is almost confirmed
i mean i couldn't believe it when i saw
it but
he
i'm getting emotional
trying not to
but i care about my country so much
people
people
he had documents
he had documents
[Laughter]
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
[Laughter]
oh i love my country so much and to see
him be destroyed
right in front of me
america
come back come back
documents
yeah documents
[Laughter]
people
let's try to soldier on
be strong
be strong
we can do this if we stick together
documents
well um michael schellenberger is
reporting that the french minister
uh
barbara pompili
uh reportedly she's she said in march
that she told the u.s energy secretary
granholm
so she told grant holm
that
if the united states wants to help
you have to increase your production of
energy if you're going to help us
so france
the french minister asked
our
energy
guru
to make more
make more energy that's the only way to
help france
and granholm said that she would
and then she didn't
then we did not the united states did
not
now i get that yeah that was probably
for uh for liquid gas i'm assuming
now
um
is that embarrassing to you as if you're
american
that's deeply shameful to me
because you remember lafayette
you know lafayette
we are here you know lafayette helped
the americans
win the civil uh
win the uh revolutionary war
and uh
and then was it was a general patton
who when he landed he said lafayette
we're here repaying the favor
you know we do have a special
relationship with france and france is
basically
having a not basically but it's a
gigantic security problem
it's not just
you know food and electricity it's this
war
and we're gonna let france down
in an emergency
what
are we really doing this is the united
states did the united states turn down a
direct request
from france
from france
really are they going to help us the
next time we're we're
would you expect them to
you know reciprocity
is a pretty important deal
it may be one of the most important
things in the world
and we're just getting more reciprocity
as one of the most important elements of
all our security
uh this this is
maybe the worst thing
that i've heard of that we've done in a
long time and we've done some bad things
am i am i having the wrong reaction to
this
because this isn't a this isn't a
regular country that we're talking about
you know we're not talking about oh
ecuador we made you a promise and we
didn't keep it
this is france
france we have a different relationship
with am i wrong
did something change in the last hundred
years that nobody told me about
france and the united states have a
blood bond
we help them in this situation
am i wrong
in this situation
we help france
if that's changing don't expect them to
be here when we need help
good lord
i mean this is the most basic thing you
would do
for an ally they ask you directly
for energy which you could produce
you know we could just produce more
and we we decided not to do it after
promising them that we would
that's just the skivviest thing ever we
should be very embarrassed about that
all right let's get to the fun story
so
bill maher had on his show rob reiner
and have you wondered to yourself what
the hell is wrong with rob ryder
because you've seen his tweets
and his tweets look as if
he's in some kind of weird bubble
where information is not reaching him
except you know from the left
and
so now we have a confirmation
this is a this actually happened last
night
it answers all of your questions are you
ready
now didn't you think
i got a pause here for a minute
sorry i just got a pause for a moment
uh there is a way to identify npcs
everybody who says the word meathead
during this conversation
probably is an npc
why
because it's the most obvious thing you
would say in this conversation
oh that's why they called him me had his
character when he played a character
long ago oh me head
so you can identify all of the
npcs because they're just going to save
me had the entire time i'm talking about
this make a hat meet your head
all right
oh my god you're so boring
anyway
this actually happened on bill maher's
show with rob reiner
so mara was saying um
uh talking about the uh i think it was
about the
laptop being suppressed
so mars said it's a little bit of a
thorny question because once you go down
this road
this is sort of where we are in this
country
the other side is so evil that anything
is justified in preventing them from
taking office
is it
bill maher asked
so bill maher asked rob reiner my
question
remember my question
if you see me tweeting it like a fool
for the last couple weeks
my question was if you really believe
what you say you believe
why wouldn't you do anything to stop
trump from getting in office including
rig an election
and and i've been saying why is there no
there's not even a republican asking
that question
it took it took bill maher to ask the
question in public he's the only one
so bill maher let me give you a sitting
ovation
for asking the only question that was
important i think
the only important question was have we
reached a situation where you would
expect the democrats to cheat on an
election
of course you would
i would
now i'm not saying i have evidence that
happened but under the current situation
of course you would expect that of
course you would because i would
if the situation were reversed and i
believed i really believed
i i was stopping some kind of hitler
monster i would break an election
wouldn't you
wouldn't you i mean seriously and you
have to ask that question because that's
a very important part of the
context of everything we're talking
about
all right so bill maher to his
everlasting credit asked exactly the
only question we should be asking
is if it's gotten that bad you know what
is there that you wouldn't do
and then what did rob reiner do when
asked the only important question
he dodged it and he changed the topic
to that january 6 stuff was bad wasn't
it he couldn't even handle the question
um
and then when mars said they buried the
hunter biden story before the election
because they were like quote uh we can't
risk having the election thrown to trump
we'll tell them after the election
and so now now you all know that that's
true right
there's no doubt in the news
about whether the laptop story is first
of all true it really belonged to hunter
and second of all it's also completely
true that 50 current and ex-intelligent
officials lied
and said it was russian
disinformation
now that's just well-known information
right is there anybody here who didn't
know those two facts
is there any person here who didn't know
those things to be true
that it was really hunter's laptop
and that really the government
colluded to say that it wasn't to change
the result of the election
that's just we all know that right
there's not a single person here who
doesn't think that's true right
because i don't believe that's in
question i believe that's now just a
fact that both sides would say as a fact
here's what rob reiner said to that
and we know for a fact that that's what
they did reiner responded
he actually didn't know that
he was hearing it for the first time
and
and mara yelled of course
you don't follow this
mar was actually finding out that rob
reiter wasn't following this story the
biggest story or one of them in the news
and yeah he tweets about it he's very
involved in politics and the size of
this story and rob reiter had not heard
about it
like heard about the full story
and then
mars said
oh then reiner said i don't know what
they did so he admitted it
he was not familiar with the story
and then mark quipped i know because you
only watch msnbc
which is exactly the correct answer
so mark called the narrow for being in a
bubble and not knowing something that
even other people in the bubble know is
true
like he's within a bubble within a
bubble
i don't think that's not fair i don't
think bill maher's in a bubble i think
bill maher is actually
able to move between bubbles
yeah and zucker confirmed that
the fbi asked facebook to
tamp down on the story
so
now does this not answer your question
so you think you have a political divide
in this country but we don't
you just you just found out what's
happening we don't have a political
difference in this country
we do have differences of opinions
but everything that you think is this
great divide where we're at each other
it's all because
of news bubbles
the news business has created all of it
none of this is real
none of this
none of this is real when you meet your
neighbor
right
you and your neighbor are fine it's just
that people who have been completely
hypnotized by one bubble and by the way
it would be just as bad
if you somehow only watched
right-leaning media right i'm not saying
that the left is the one that's wrong
and the right is always right
i'm saying that whichever bubble you
stay in you're lost
you're lost if you can't get out of your
bubble
and rob reiner
confessed on
a national show that he doesn't follow
the news that he comments on emotionally
it's exactly what you thought wasn't it
or did you think there was something
else going on
did you think he was well informed and
lied
did or did you think this was exactly
what it looked like he didn't he didn't
know the news
you think he knew
so some people are saying he knew what
he was lying i don't think so
because if he knew he would have played
it differently
he would have he would have uh you know
he would have tried to excuse his
behavior but he didn't he just said he
didn't know
that's different
well we now have a very clear pattern
which is when the democrats are going to
do something super criminal
they will
blame the republicans of doing that same
thing
because it makes your own crime
completely invisible
it's a psychological trick to make your
own crime invisible
so when the democrats were colluding
with russia to create the steele dossier
what was the accusation the accusation
was republicans are colluding with
russia
so while the democrats were literally
and this is now a fact
colluding with russians not russia
necessarily but russians
they were literally colluding with
russians
and they created this um narrative that
the republicans were doing
now of course they can things get gray
because manafort was in fact doing a
sketchy deal with a with the russians
basically manafort was selling a rich
russian guy worthless information
how much does internal polling how much
is that worth to a russian
pretty much nothing
and that's what manafort was accused of
giving to russia guy internal polling
there's no value at all
none it was probably just so the russian
could say that he had some information
when he talked to putin so he could be
like more of an insider or something
that's probably all it was
now that really happened and manafort
has to pay for that and he is
um but so now we've seen the pattern so
if they're going to collude with russia
they will accuse you of colluding with
russia
and um
and now
uh
with january 6
the january sex
too many republicans looks like
it was a an insurrection right
because
there was a you know the the laptop
story was suppressed and i would think
you could call that insurrection because
it changed the nature of the vote
probably it probably changed the nature
of the vote
so what do the
democrats say when they stage a
successful inter insurrection because it
was successful
biden actually won
because of the
probably one because the 50 intel agents
said it was russian disinformation
that probably made the difference we
don't know for sure
but so they stage a successful
insurrection and then the first thing
they do to cover their crime is to blame
the republicans of an insurrection
so the republicans who were trying to
stop what they thought was an
insurrection
you know meaning that they thought the
vote was rigged and i'm not saying it
was rigged i'm saying that's what they
thought
um
so now we we see two major cases where
the democrats did a crime and then very
publicly accused the republicans of that
same crime
but if you do the accusation big enough
it actually erases
your ability to see that they're the
ones who committed that same crime
it works
it's worked
we're watching it work right now it
works twice
well let's talk about cancelling those
student loan debts
so remember when biden said that the
cuts would be paid for
and then that got redefined for well
what we mean by paid for
is that we saved money in other ways
unrelated to this and so that gives us
some money to spend
because we would have spent more in
those other ways but we didn't
so therefore
free money
now
isn't this exactly where democrats get
money
let me explain that a republican who
needs money
i'm a republican i need some money what
will i do
what are my options let's see i could
get a job
i could work
i could work and i could make myself
some money that's what i'm gonna do i'm
gonna go work and get myself some money
so that would be a republican plan
here's a democrat needs money i need
money
who who already has some money
suppose i could get that money from them
without working wouldn't that be cool
all right i'll try to do that
i mean it's a totally different
the mindset is that somebody has my
money and i have to go get it
democrats actually believe that other
people have your money
oh i have money it's just that somebody
else is holding it right now i got lots
of money
if you would just take it out of your
pocket and put it where it belongs back
in my pocket i'd have all my money but
you're holding all my money now
give me back all my money that you
earned
and this this feels like more of that
because they're they're trying to find a
correlation be between
it's possible for me to take money from
you
therefore is free
that's that's the summary of what their
actual explanation is they're saying
that since it was possible
to change the budget in other ways
that would have reduced it by 300
billion
more
but now they can take some of that back
so they're taking back the thing that
wasn't real
basically it's all about finding free
money
so they use words
they use words
to create a structure that makes it
right for them to transfer money from
wherever it is
in your pocket to somewhere else
yeah it's called theft
well
and of course you know that pelosi a
year ago or so said that
biden can't do that he doesn't have the
authority
i guess he can delay debt but he can't
cancel it only only congress can do that
so what's going to happen now
what's going to happen
so biden signs the executive order
pelosi is on record of saying that's
illegal he can't do that
what happens
has anybody gamed this out yet
does does pelosi change your mind
or does she go against biden and you
know and try to get it done and she
probably wouldn't succeed actually
because the republicans would hold tough
in the senate
so what happens now
i mean to me it feels like it can't
happen
like i don't i don't think it's going to
happen i don't think this that
cancellation is going to happen
what do you think
and then somebody said that there can't
be a lawsuit unless somebody has
standing
how in the world do i not have standing
don't i have standing
because it seems to me that somebody is
just re taking my money and giving it to
somebody else without legal process
if somebody takes my money and gives it
to somebody else without legal process
don't i have standing for a lawsuit
that seems like the simplest most exact
explanation of what
legal standing would be
i i think so
so how many of you think this is
actually going to happen i'm going to go
on record
with my prediction
that there will not in the end be a
successful debt relief for
and i think maybe they'll be just as
happy
uh
why'd you go all racist on me
what's up with that
i'm gonna get rid of you
all right um
all right well that's happening
is this my imagination or did this
actually happen
did all of this smart democrat pundits
suddenly go silent on mar-a-lago
because i see people still talk about it
on twitter but you know if you were to
take all the democrats the left-leaning
people who talk about politics and you
were to rank them
i'd say i'd put something like david
axelrod
at the top of the rational people
i just like to use him as my example i
don't think he says crazy things
he says things that are clearly you know
for his team but they're fairly
transparent you know when he's doing it
he's not crazy
but but you know there there are some
that'll just say any anything
just any crazy thing
and those are the ones who are still
talking about mar-a-lago being a bad
thing
but i feel like
all of the left-leaning critics who are
sort of in a slightly
a slightly credible situation they're
just backing off
now dershowitz did weigh in and said
there was it looks like there was enough
for an indictment
but you all know that that doesn't mean
anything right an indictment can easily
be gotten just because somebody says
well we think there's something there we
better go look
so getting an indictment doesn't tell
you anything about whether there was a
crime
uh axelrod said obama was lying when he
was uh anti-gay marriage yeah so that's
an example of where
axelrod is credible
all right
um
so what we know now from this affidavit
is that
uh it did not it did not establish that
trump was unresponsive
so the reason that the fbi says they had
to go in there is that trump was
unresponsive now he might have been i'm
not saying he was or was not but the
documents apparently don't
establish that so that would if it's
true it would have to be established
with some other evidence
but then of course there's this enormous
gray area of what does it mean to be
unresponsive or uncooperative
because i doubt it was completely
uncooperative because they gave some
boxes back don't you think it was more
like there was a dispute
as in
we think you should give us these things
back and then they said well we think
that the law says we don't have to
i'm not so sure that that was just being
unresponsive
maybe it was just being i have a
different opinion about whether you
could have this
maybe it was just that i don't know but
i think it's not going to be as simple
as
ignoring their phone calls or something
like that
so i think the story has gone now from
he's got nuclear secrets to um he did
not handle documents correctly and i
guess there's some laws about that too
now i guess it's legal for him to have
photocopies of everything there
isn't that weird
um
that he legally apparently he could have
had photocopies because he could have
declassified the material
so he could have all the information in
any way he wanted he just couldn't have
the originals
so was this really only a debate about
the originals
because i do think the government
probably owns the originals i don't know
so if it turns out that's all it was
was a debate about whether he could have
copies or the originals
that's sort of close to nothing isn't it
that's not as close as you can get to
nothing
i mean i i get that they need to take
care of that stuff
but
it's pretty close to nothing
all right
here's some good news for you i saw this
in a tweet by navin cobra
apparently
we're on our way to very soon having
more stu students in the us studying
computer science
than all of the humanities degrees put
together
how about that
but you didn't see that coming
so between science degrees and computer
science degrees which are both um on a
steep upward curve
the social sciences are on a steep
downward curve
so it looks like things work out
maybe if you wait things just work out
things adjust so that's good news
uh until the computers learn to program
themselves at which point all of those
degrees will be uh worthless
and then you're gonna wish you had an
english english degree
i actually i don't know what the
computers will do
better first my job or
or computing
all right here's a
here's a tweet
that could only be tweeted by a woman
and get away with it okay
so i'm gonna read the tweet but the
thing you have to know
is that it was a woman
right
because if i said this i get in trouble
but a woman can say it right so the
woman is uh
i think
gael
caico
she's got a jd
so this is a pretty serious
professional woman who's got some
credentials
and she tweeted this
the reality is we are living in a
matriarchal society
men are not the leaders women are
we're not going to war
we meaning women we're not going to war
hunting for food or hand building houses
to survive
we exist in a narration
women are the narrators and their
appeals or entreaties affect men far and
wide
so basically uh if i could paraphrase
this
uh women are the actors and men are just
the supporting players
now this is a there's a version of this
that i used to say
which was
maybe men make the money but who spends
it
who spends most of the money in your
household if you have a you know
traditional household
don't the women make most of the
spending decisions
i think most of my money has been spent
by women
yeah i mean obviously both of you are
gonna decide on the house and the car
and stuff like that but isn't it true
that the woman has spending authority
that's not calculated into who who's
getting what
abilities
so
here's why i thought this was
interesting on a meta level
because not only is uh i hope i'm
pronouncing right g-y-a-l how would you
pronounce that guyal
guiller or gael
right i'd say gael
but
her point is made because i couldn't
tweet that so this is something a woman
can say in public and you know she gets
a little pushback but it's fine
but if i said that it would haunt me for
the rest of my days
am i wrong
if i had tweeted that idea
it would haunt me for the rest of my
days i would be practically cancelled
for it
so her point is made she can say this
but i can't
it's a matriarchal society
and generally speaking women have a
greater freedom of speech
wouldn't you say
it's not even close
uh gl you say gl maybe
uh because men allow it yeah
why do men allow women to be in control
let me get that
why do why do men while you say sex
that's
part of the answer
no you're that's almost the answer
partial credit
why do men let women get away with
whatever they want basically
it's because men can't use violence
violence is taken out of the equation if
men could use violence
then men would be in charge in all their
relationships with women
but we can't i'm not saying we should
i'm not arguing for violence don't don't
mistake that i'm just saying that you
take a situation which biology had
created
which is there's a big one and a small
one
the big one's usually in charge
until you develop civilization and laws
as soon as you put in the civilization
and the laws
which have many benefits many benefits
it puts women in charge
so
women in relationships are in charge
women who are not in relationships
far less in charge
now
i know what some of you
so i know what some of you are saying
you're saying devin
demiscott
you just need to get a better woman
and then the woman will
recognize your
patriarchal rule to which i say you're
right
i wouldn't argue that point
if you can find somebody who's
compatible with you in that way that
would be terrific go do that
i'm just saying that the normal
situation not what should be
not what you should do not what i do has
nothing to do with us individually i'm
just saying in general
men are completely
neutered because they can't use violence
and shouldn't and shouldn't
but as long as the situation is that the
men uh their primary tool is taken away
from them
but women's primary tool of
having you know having control of the
sexual resource
that is not taken away
so if one person has a weapon and the
other doesn't who's in charge
it's not a hard question
if only one person has a weapon
it's the one in charge
all right
it's all because of man buns somebody
says yes man buns ruined everything
um
women theoretically protect the family
with men's resources
that's that's true you both protect the
family with both of your resources
what about porn takes away from women
yeah so porn is a way that men
try to regain
power
and what do women say about porn
you miserable loser using that porn do
you know why women hate porn
it's competition takes their power away
because a guy can just say all right
well if i'm not getting sex i always got
bored
so it's sort of a power equalizer so
women reasonably don't like it
um that's it you're describing males not
men
not men
the the whole uh
the whole uh
you know if you're man enough everything
will work out that's not that's not a
thing
if you're man enough and you're lucky
enough or smart enough to find a woman
who
is happy with that situation well that's
great
but you can't just
man your way to make every situation
work
you're not going to alpha every woman
because
they don't need to be awful they'll just
say well
good luck getting sex
and i'll take half your money if you've
got a complaint
and erica says it's because i'm beta
erica you are operating at the lowest
this is a different erika not the erica
we like
this would be a bad erika apparently
there's a doppelganger erica who says
dumb things on on youtube
so not the one who says smart clever
things on locals but there's there's a
dumb one on
youtube
so
dark erika
so the the npc take is that whatever my
opinion is is because there's something
wrong with me
right
the the lowest level of thinking
is that the cause of my opinion is is
some personal problem i have
now i'm not saying that that's not true
but it's true of everybody you know your
your personal situation always
filters out through your your opinions
so that's true but if that's all you
have to add
that your personal experience might have
something to do with your decisions
you're not really adding much
so
if you want to be an npc
here's how to contribute in any argument
somebody says
i think the corporate tax rate should be
lower
what you do is is go into the comments
and say well you would say that because
you're ugly
or uh
five years ago you tweeted something i
disagreed with so
so
duh
yeah that's the npc way to go go after
the person don't go after the argument
because if you go after the argument
you'll be
instantly revealed as being empty and
useless
so you have to go after the person
very important
will you get a picture of the kids loan
you paid off
advice about women coming from you is
hilarious david did i give you advice
did
did you hear oh you mean device advice
about women did i give anybody advice
did you hear that
did anybody hear any advice that i just
gave because david did
david heard me give advice
so you're hallucinating
and and you see how he he phrased it he
phrased that that is something wrong
with me
that's the npc approach
you didn't have any problem with what i
said
you had a problem that it was me
so check yourself nbc
if you thought you were real you just
found out you're not
because the real people would say
something about the argument or maybe
something additive
something funny
but if you're an npc all you can say is
there's something wrong with the person
there's something wrong with the person
who said that
something wrong with the person
all right
um
so did did you see that trump
trump truth or
you know he posted
uh a redacted page and the only thing
unredacted was um
make america great again
you saw some other people do the joke
where it was everything was redacted
except the words orange man bad
where did you see that joke first
where did you see that joke first that's
my joke
i did that the last time we were dealing
with some redaction
i think other people did it too it's not
like i was the first one to think of it
but somebody asked me if that's the
greatest response trump ever had to
which i said
it's not really original
it's funny
it wasn't original when i did it either
all right
what about women and the hot food thing
what about it
all right
yeah the one with biden trying to climb
up the redacted lines on the document
that was really well done
i was just watching uh
who was it jamie
who's the actor
musician played he played ray charles
jamie
why don't i remember his name
jamie foxx
played ray charles i saw a
clip about him talking about how
he said that attractive people are not
billionaires
attractive men i think attractive men
are not billionaires usually
and his reason was
that if you're attractive you don't need
to be a billionaire
because the only reason you would
acquire that many resources is to
compensate for not being attractive
because the only thing people care about
is their mating instinct
and i thought okay that's exactly right
that is exactly right
the the less attractive you are the
harder if you're a man this is for men
the less attractive you are the harder
you work
to have something to compensate for that
i can tell you absolutely
that when i was 11 years old i looked in
the mirror and said i'm going to have to
have a good job
truly
truly
at 11 years old i could tell okay i'm
going to need a really good job
to you know compensate for this
that's a true story
and from about that age i said i'm gonna
really have to kill it in order to
have options
and so i
worked hard to try to kill it
but you don't think everybody has that
realization fairly early
because you do notice really early that
the attractive kids are getting away
with more right especially the
attractive females
you notice that from the earliest age
the attractive ones get away with murder
they notice it too
they know they don't have to work hard
to have a good life they really don't if
they can keep their looks
they can coast that's how it works
being good looking works against guys as
they age really i don't know about that
i don't think being good looking works
against anybody
you've never turned a woman's head
except away in disgust somebody says
do i think joe biden knew about the raid
um
i don't know and i'm not sure i care
i'm not sure that's important
you know you could easily imagine that
they
didn't tell him it was going to happen
so that he wouldn't have to say he knew
you know i mean i'm not sure it matters
um
you know it's possible that there are a
lot of things that joe biden doesn't
know that just might be one of them
um
i'm the best thank you
talk about sam harris i haven't listened
to his new podcast about trump yet but i
think i will do that
i will key that up this morning
yeah
i know how much does it really matter if
does it matter if the biden
administration knew what the fbi was
doing because my assumption is that the
fbi
is working its own game
yeah i don't think that the fbi is
taking orders from biden
i think it might be the other way around
what do you think
because remember the fbi has interfered
with both democrat and republican
candidates
in recent years
they've interfered with both democrats
and republicans which suggests that
they're playing their own game
that they're in it for their own you
know retention of power
so i don't i don't think that they
necessarily tell biden anything
unless it helps them
i don't think it has to do with bidens
i think they
i think that trump was too dangerous to
have in the job for the fbi
and so they made sure he wasn't in the
job anymore
yeah working independently right so i'm
not sure there's that big difference
between having a conversation with
somebody
versus just knowing what they would like
you to do
you know when people talk about the
russian troll farm
they did not say
putin ordered them to interfere in the
election they don't say that they say
it's likely that there was a billionaire
who wanted to put himself in good
standing with with putin and simply had
an idea what putin might want him to do
and so he used his troll farm to
you know do some memes in the elections
then probably went to putin said hey
look what i did for you
you know we're buddies
you and me
i'm helping you you helped me i think
that was the whole game
and and those beams were completely
useless and they actually attacked both
sides hillary and and trump but they
helped trump more than hillary it's just
it was it was no impact really
hey tango i see that call back
[Music]
um yeah zuckerberg said blocking the
laptop story fit the pattern but the fbi
told them that there was going to be a
big russian disinformation dump coming
so when it fit the pattern that wasn't
an accident because the fbi established
the pattern and then said hey watch out
for this pattern
so by the time the facebook saw the
pattern they had been well primed for it
so that was very i think that was a
pretty specific case
of the fbi um
staging and insurrection
i would call that an insurrection
wouldn't you
if the fbi tells social media to
tamp down a story that would change the
nature of the elections
that's an insurrection
what else would it be
or a coup
i mean to me the evidence is right there
now why is it that why is it that you
can't see
that the fbi getting facebook to
you know clamp down on that is an
insurrections
do you know why we can't see it i mean
if you're on the other side the politics
you can but do you know why the the
democrats can't see that
it's because of the trick they use where
they accuse the other side of their
crimes
as long as your accusation of the same
crime is bigger and getting all the
attention
it's literally invisible that you did
the crime even when it's completely in
evidence
so the evidence of
of the democrats
doing something horrible
is not even in question
is there anybody who's who is doubting
zuckerberg's
account i don't think so there's nobody
who says zuckerberg is lying
there's nobody who says no the fbi did
not do that we did not warn you that
there was some disinformation coming
it's all right there
so this is evidence that's not even in
doubt
so just think about this
the evidence that nobody questions
paints a clear picture of insurrection
clear
there's no gray area there at all they
were trying to affect the election
by getting the media to suppress a major
story about a candidate that was true
it was a true story
about probably
a sketchy dealings with ukraine
now compare the story that is absolutely
true and everybody knows is true there's
not even any question about the facts
compare that with
say the january 6th allegations where
everything's
sort of sketchy
meaning that two-thirds of the people
who were there definitely were there to
try to save the republic not overthrow
it
and that nobody brought weapons i mean
i'm sorry there were weapons in
attendance but the but the so-called
insurrectionists did not use guns for
their insurrection
so
what kind of an insurrection is that
so you've got
two competing stories
one is a known fact that the fbi uh
through the election
it's not even in question
there's there's no dispute about that
fact
and yet we ignore that
because there's this bigger thing that's
ambiguous
as long as the bigger ambiguous thing is
drawing all our attention
where it's actually invisible that we
have all the facts we need to put the
entire fbi in jail
the leadership of the fbi anyway they
should actually be in jail
and it's visible to you
so they've created a a cognitive screen
so you just can't see it
now when i say you i don't mean you
specifically some of you can see it
but you need to get a lot more of the
citizens to be able to see it and
they'll never be able to it's just
hidden
behind the
the the look-alike um
allegations that's just bigger and
sexier
it's really kind of amazing
to watch it uh play out in real life
to to see that you can fool uh
what what what did lincoln say you could
fool
some of the people
some of the time but you can't fool
all the people all the time or something
like that
that needs to be revised
to you can fool half of the people all
the time
you can fool half of the people all the
time
anything the republicans say their base
will believe anything the democrats say
their base beliefs and you can do it
every time
when was the last time the democrats
let's say the leadership
had had an idea that was so bad
that even the democrat base said well
that doesn't even make sense
i'm out
all right i like all your other stuff
but this new thing whatever the new
thing is hypothetically this new thing
that's too far i i can't get on board
with that
have you ever seen that
that doesn't happen
it doesn't happen
because half of the half of the public
can be fooled every time
half of the public can be fooled every
time
so
so
lincoln wasn't so smart
i think i i think i've upgraded
lincoln's thing half of the public can
be fooled every time
it's a different half it's not always
the same half
now if you think it's only the left who
can be fooled
you're not really catching the point
here
the point is republicans could say
absolutely anything the leadership
and their base would believe it
because there's no exceptions
you've never seen the republicans say at
least in modern times have you ever seen
a republican leadership say something
okay this is going to be our narrative
and the base rejected it oh my god
that's a crazy narrative even though i'm
a republican i have to reject that
doesn't happen
half of the public can be fooled
every time
uh
i'm not going to argue the definitions
of insurgent versus insurrection versus
coup
since everybody knows what i'm talking
about i'm not going to get into a
definitional
debate
here it is
you can fool all the people some of the
time and some of the people all the time
but you cannot fool all the people all
the time
you can fool half of the people all the
time
much
much shorter
i think mine is better it's a better
summary
all right
we rejected it when republicans said
trump wasn't presidential
why do you think why do you think you
did that
i hate to say i'm the reason for that
but i probably am
you you know that the transition of
trump
from
uh is just a joke to trump as a serious
candidate
that was probably me
you know that right
because i'm the one who framed him as
strategically and persuasively brilliant
which has proven to be quite correct
so if he had not been proved
if i had not redefined him quite
publicly as being somebody who had
skills that you didn't recognize
i don't think it would have happened
because the narrative there had to be a
narrative to counter the narrative that
he was just a crazy clown looking for
publicity and i i reframed that that was
me
well so i see that some of you are
rightly skeptical of my claims
that's the sort of claim where you
should start with skepticism
can we agree
if you heard anybody say what i just
said or any version of anything like
that
your your starting point should be i
don't think so
i don't think so but let me ask you
there are enough people watching here
who watched from the beginning
i'll ask you the question do you think
that i
specifically and primarily the reason
that trump was taken seriously
by republicans
and
so there's going to be a mix of answers
so everything from f no to yes certainly
yes 100 yes yes yes yes there are no's a
few no's probably
mostly yes's right so
while we can't there there's no way we
can there's such a difference here on
the youtube is more now
so the people who know me best
and have followed me the longest or on
the locals platform there's quite a
difference yeah quite a difference in
your answers the on for the people on
youtube you probably have followed less
uh i would say if you read win bigly my
book your opinion might change
um
you're smarter
your ego is very strong today npc
so ralph has
shown himself to be an npc so his
comment to my comment that i influence
things is that my ego is big
what does that mean
it means he's an npc because he could
have debated the point oh i don't think
that made a difference or
or maybe it was something else that made
a difference but instead he had to go
for my ego
there had to be something about me
npc right
so every time you see that just say oh
npc and then don't answer
because anybody who's operating on the
npc level they're just scenery you
should ignore them
you saw ann coulter say it first not not
what i said
i think ann coulter was
uh predicting it based on
illegal immigration being such an
important
topic which she was right about she was
right about that but i was the one who
said he's he's about persuasion and that
i think made the difference
all right let me ask you this how many
of you did i save from tds
is there anybody here who had tds and i
talked them out of it
i'm seeing yeses
i had some yeses and no's
no
all right well a lot of people did get
talked out of their tds
but maybe not you
maybe not you because some of you were
already talked out of it
all right well looks like i did convince
a number of people i did ask once in a
poll
if i change people's vote for trump
and i think 1500 people immediately said
yes that they voted for him because i
changed their minds to do so
and
that's just how many answered the poll
imagine how many people
did not answer the poll
i figured at a minimum i moved
50 000 votes
would you say i think i controlled about
not controlled but i think i influenced
about 50 000 votes
that'd be my guess minimum
could be a bit you know could be a
quarter million
but i think minimum of fifty thousand
all right
diamond and silk i haven't seen them
lately
all right
fbi took the fake because too far
all right um
you're real just looking at your
comments now all right that's all for
now
i'm gonna go uh do something else and uh
i will talk to you all
later
bye for now
