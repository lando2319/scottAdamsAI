hey everybody
well you may have noticed my aborted
attempt
to do a live stream this morning i was
trying to
uh have a guest dr nicole sapphire
i'm going to try to reschedule her i
tried to use the
haps tv app
but it never gave me an option to to add
a guest
so we'll talk to the
people who make that app and see if they
can tell me
how is it that i would find an option to
add a guest which is
the entire point of the app imagine
having an app
whose main point is to add a guest and
nowhere you can find any kind of button
that would do that
so that would be your interface
recommendation for the day
if you make an app that only does one
thing or
mainly is for one thing you should have
some kind of a button
to do that thing but how would you like
to enjoy
the simultaneous sip to its maximum
extent all you need is a cup remover
glass of tanker chelsea's die in a
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous
sip what's it called the simultaneous
sep yeah
and it happens now go
so the interview that i'll try to do as
soon as i get my technology to work
not today apparently would be with uh dr
nicole sapphire
you all know her from fox news you've
seen her
and her new book is called panic attack
playing politics with science in the
fight against kovan 19. and it's
available tomorrow meaning you can order
it today but it's
i think tomorrow is the the official
date but you can order it today
and you should get yourself a copy
all right let's talk about some other
stuff
um you heard the story about the uh
apparently there's some intelligence
reporting now this says that in november
of 2019 there were a few
uh employees of the wuhan lab
who were sickened in a way reminiscent
of covid
and if that's true then it would suggest
that china knew
there was a virus getting out a little
earlier than they told us
now is it true well let's look at the
source
the source is an undisclosed foreign
intelligence agency
and let me tell you if there's one thing
you can trust in this world
it's an undisclosed foreign source
uh-huh yeah those undisclosed foreign
sources
they're right every time for example
there was the steele dossier
foreign source pretty good information
right
there was the world health organization
got a lot of information from china
i guess that was pretty good wasn't it
yeah those foreign sources you can
really trust
so what are the odds that this story is
true
i'm gonna say low i'm going to say
low now that doesn't mean that it didn't
happen
it doesn't mean that maybe there there
were some infections before we knew
about it
but what are the odds that an
undisclosed
foreign intelligence agency is telling
us something true
really i i would just put zero
credibility on it
now be careful when you hear me say zero
credibility credibility doesn't mean
something is true or false
it's just by its nature and the way the
information
came to you this is something you should
give serious consideration to
and i would say well you have to pay
attention to it
i mean it's it's a big enough story you
can't ignore it
but the odds of it being true um
i had a coin flip at best i think
all right apparently uh
new york city is going to open up all of
its schools to
uh in the fall for in person and they're
not going to have these
zoom schools anymore in new york city
mayor de blasio says that
and i think it's notable not only
because it's new york city
but de blasio is kind of a masking
lockdown kind of a guy so if he's saying
schools are opened in the fall i feel
like
i feel like we we did it
we meaning the world i think we're on
the
we're getting a handle on this thing i
think we're going to be on the other
side of it pretty soon
so that's all good news president biden
finally issued a strong tweet he said
the recent attacks on the jewish
community are
despicable and they must stop i condemn
this hateful behavior at home and abroad
it's
uh up to all of us to give hate no safe
harbor
which i like that last part the last
part of the sentence where he puts the
responsibility on the citizens
right where he should be in this case so
i like that he framed it that way
but here's the question if
president trump had waited
this long to condemn violence against
jewish americans
don't you think or really jewish people
around the world
don't you think that there would be a
gigantic uproar
and they would say it's obvious why you
waited so long why did you
why did you wait so long
and here i saw this tweet and then i
looked for the news
where the news would say biden waited so
long
it's proof he's anti-semitic
but i didn't see that story so
are you telling me that you can't read
somebody's mind
based on how long it took them to say
something that's
mundane and ordinary and expected and
does nothing whatsoever
i mean it doesn't really make the world
a better place it's better that the
president says it than
being silent on it i mean it's
definitely better than saying nothing
but it's not going to make a difference
right
is there anybody on the street who said
oh wait a minute
i was just going to hit this jewish
person with a brick
but now i see this tweet from president
biden and well
now i see it's my responsibility not to
do that it's not going to make any
difference
but you still have to do it that's how
leadership works
but what took him so long is the
question we must ask
so it turns out that our greatest fears
about biden
may be overblown just as the greatest
fears about
trump from the other side were a little
overblown
and it turns out that the republicans
are probably going to do a
pretty good job of blocking the the
biggest changes
so and apparently even infrastructure
isn't really
making its way through congress the way
you think it might have partly because
there's a difference in
opinion about what qualifies as
infrastructure
for some reason republicans are hung up
on the definition
of the word if you want to know
what incompetent government looks like
it would be your government arguing over
what a word means
how is that good now
some of the things that i think we're
talking about as to whether or not
they're part of
infrastructure or not i know stuff like
wi-fi
and things like that but isn't the real
question whether the individual things
are worth doing
the question is not whether it's called
infrastructure
is it here's a question that doesn't
help anybody
which one is labeled infrastructure and
which one should be called different
words
that means nothing nothing's changed
because the words you put on it
either the things in the infrastructure
bill
are individually worth doing or they're
not worth doing
why does it matter if we call them
infrastructure
now i'm usually opposed to these big
omnibus
bills where you throw in all the pork
but i don't think that's what this
is this seems to be a whole bunch of
ideas which if you looked at them
individually
you might say that's a pretty good idea
that's different from pork
pork would be let's build a bridge where
we don't need it
pork would be let's put a military base
maybe where we don't need it you know
that that's pork
because it's not really helping
everybody it's helping it's helping one
state or even one politician in one
state
but if you've got a grab bag of
different things
you know wi-fi and i don't know whatever
the other things are in there
i feel as if those are not pork those
are just
things which people think are good and
we could debate them
so why not just debate them one by one
the the argument it's not infrastructure
is just stupid that's just stupid
i mean i get that it might be a
shorthand way of saying
you know these are not uh justified
expenditures
but none of it is really i mean you
don't
you don't have to fix the potholes you
don't have to
you do have to fix the bridges make sure
they don't fall down
so it's a whole bunch of things that we
should be looking at individually and
not arguing about whether they fit the
definition of infrastructure
because that's just dumb so i guess
republicans are also blocking some minor
gun control things
it looks like they'll probably stop the
committee to
look into the capital protests so those
are three examples cnn pointed out
in which the gop is actually
having more success than you might have
imagined in stopping things
now i think it all depends on joe
manchin being willing to
oppose changing the filibuster rule
so so it ends up you know the
republicans can filibuster
to delay things but uh you know as long
as they have that they have a little
more power than
they should for the number of people
they they have elected
all right um do you remember i was
telling you yesterday
and i hadn't heard anybody else say this
out loud
which is that israel has no reason to
make peace
and in fact the pel the hamas
leadership also has no reason to make
peace
they have lots of reasons to make war
but they don't have any reason to make
peace
now the the palestinian people have
reason to make peace
definitely and there are probably lots
of individual citizens in israel
that would like to make some peace but
it's not good for the country of israel
because they have all the power and they
can gobble up land and just dominate the
region and
they're they're so superior to
militarily and economically
that they can just kind of do what they
want and it's hard to criticize another
country
for pursuing its legal and
obviously justifiable self-interest
well self-interest is a little too far
but
pursuing their let's say strategic
safety is of course perfectly acceptable
now fareed zicario who i've noted i
think is one of the
the more useful and productive voices on
cnn
says the same uh largely the same thing
not not exactly the same thing
but he said that israel has no practical
reason for making deals with the
palestinians
uh economically or defense wise because
they're just not a risk
and um
but also there's there's sort of no one
to negotiate with right because there's
no one who really wants this piece
hamas doesn't want it at least
leadership
so who are you going to negotiate with
so there's certainly no point to it but
i didn't expect to see
um cnn's you know an important voice on
cnn
i didn't expect them to say it directly
that israel has no practical reason for
peace
now free does make the ethical and moral
argument
that there's a moral and ethical reason
to make peace in terms of israel
but since when do countries care about
that
never i can't think of a time
can you maybe we can let's think
optimistically here can you think of a
time
that any country acted against its own
best interest
for economics and security
because there was a moral imperative to
do it and it also was
a big thing in small ways yes
certainly in lots of small ways israel
does moral and ethical things
such as warning people before they blow
up a building
right so in small ways yes plenty of
moral and ethical behavior and
some is not but
i've never can you think of an example
where a country
somebody says the marshall plan now i
would say the marshall plan was
self-interest
usa during world war one be more
specific panama
panama i'd need specifics on that
um we got into vietnam and then we got
out for moral reasons i don't think so
i don't think we got out for moral
reasons i think we got out because we
didn't have any benefit to be there
and on top of that there were moral
reasons civil war somebody says the
civil war
no paris accords i guess i guess this
one's kind of a head scratcher right
um i'd love to see an opinion from some
historians whether any country has done
done something that was in a big way
this is the big way that matters in
small ways of course
we make moral decisions but in big ways
i don't know that we do or anybody does
all right well we'll wait for some real
historians to tell us about that
so here's
more on using the rules against them
so i've told you a number of times that
if there's some kind of standard or rule
that the democrats want to impose on
society that the best way to make it go
away
if you don't like it is to fully embrace
it
don't try to argue against it because
that just hardens people asking for it
but instead just do what they do just
fully embrace it and watch it fall apart
and in an accidental way that's what
republican representative marjorie
taylor green did
now i haven't talked much about marjorie
taylor green
because i'm less interested in
individual
personalities and their little dramas
than i am than i am about you know the
bigger picture stuff
so talking about people isn't so
interesting to me
um but she did something that
got a little attention so here's the
story
so she's quoted as saying marjorie
taylor greenus
that we can look back at a time in
history where people were told to wear a
gold star
and they were definitely treated like
second class citizens
so much so that they were put in trains
and taken to gas chambers in nazi
germany
then she added and this is exactly the
type of abuse
that nancy pelosi is talking about now i
think that context is masks and maybe
i don't know vaccine passports or
something but
here marjorie taylor green is likening
our pandemic response to nazi germany
now if someone
if a democrat had said something like
this
that something something republicans are
doing is
just like nazi germany what would be
your impression
well your impression would be no it's
not
do you know what compares well with the
holocaust
almost nothing right almost nothing
so anytime anybody makes any kind of
comparison to the holocaust
it's it's going to be dumb 99.9 percent
of the time
i mean maybe if you're talking about pol
pot
maybe if you're talking about you know
yeah
chinese holocaust etc maybe you're
you're in the right ballpark
the uyghurs the uyghurs
if you're talking about that as a
holocaust they're not quite
executing them in mass but it's
certainly a genocide of some kind
so do i care
that marjorie taylor greene used a
holocaust
comparison to wearing masks
during a pandemic and the answer is it's
so ridiculous
that i think it's wonderful it's so
ridiculous
because using the democratic
theory that you can just compare
everything to the holocaust no matter
how trivial
you know i've been mocking it for years
but when i see
a republican do it exactly the way it's
been done to republicans for years
it's just funny and
you know if there's a way to make this
whole everything is nazi
everything is hiller everything is the
holocaust
if there's a way to make it go away it
would be for
republicans like marjorie taylor green
to use it all the time
just use it on every speech you know
well this uh
i think this uh infrastructure bill is
uh
clearly it's like the holocaust because
it'll make our debt go up
or uh how about uh
if we don't open school in the fall it's
gonna be the holocaust for children
just just make everything the holocaust
let's ju let's just do it
no that's a bad idea we gotta keep the
holocaust
in its own little category let's let's
not make it trivial
all right here's a question which
ironically i was thinking about the
question just when it got answered
which i which i love um and i was
thinking
there's a lot of talk about critical
race theory there's a lot of talk about
the 1619 project
and i note that just about every
conservative
is opposed to both of those things fair
statements so far
would everybody agree with those
statements the republicans and
conservatives
are pretty much universally opposed to
critical race theory
being taught in schools and the 1619
project
being taught in schools wouldn't you say
yeah in the comments people are agreeing
but then i ask myself
what are those things what is critical
race theory
you kind of know in general right like
you've got a general sense of it
what it's about but do you know the
details
i don't so i went looking for them this
morning i thought to myself
well somebody's going to have a little a
little bullet point
summary i just want to get the high
level you know get the general idea
couldn't find it couldn't find it one of
the biggest topics in the world
and i'm googling away and you know you
have to sort through all the garbage
returns maybe it's there you know so
somewhere down
in the searches i don't know but i
couldn't find
just a a good summary of what critical
race theory says you know this point
this point this point
so i could just have an opinion on it
and then same with the 1619 project
i was trying to think okay but what are
the what are the specific complaints
i did get one there was one specific
complaint about the 1619 project
which i guess there's a claim there that
part of the
justification for the civil war was to
maintain slavery which you don't have to
be a historian to know that's not true
because there were a whole lot of people
fighting the the war that had nothing to
do with slavery
you know there were just people in the
south only some of them had slaves
and yeah maybe that meant something to
them
but it wasn't the reason for the for the
revolution
so there are factual um
differences between what historians say
is true and what the 1619 project said
but i'm not sure that's the big deal you
know people get stuff wrong i don't know
if that's
what's the big deal so let me tell you
um my take on this and i was looking at
a tweet from
i have no idea how to pronounce this
name uju i'm gonna say
you who as you
i don't mean to make fun of the name
because i think it's respectful to
pronounce people's names correctly but i
have no idea how to pronounce this i'm
going to say
usu anya and i hope i got that close
um did a tweet thread and part of that
tweet said
tweetthread said now you're thinking
people want to ban somebody's type of
legal analysis
now that's what is talking about the
critical race theory well yes
but they don't even know what critical
race theory is
so now this is characterizing the people
who are against
critical race theory mostly republicans
conservatives
and as this tweet says they're racists
and white supremacists
who don't want public discussion and
legal consideration
of systemic racism and white people's
unfair advantages
well i talked to a lot of republicans
and i talked to a lot of conservatives
and
i've never gotten the feeling that there
was somebody who didn't want to discuss
systemic racism and people's uh
and white people's unfair advantages
let me tell you what i think republicans
and conservatives believe
and in the comments do me a fact check
i would say the majority of you watching
are probably on the right side of the
political
aisle so i'm going to characterize you
now
all right so when other people
characterize you it's always a problem
right
but let me let me characterize you i
believe that you
my audience would say the following and
then you can tell me how close i am
i think you would say that you would
like to see black americans
thrive not just do okay
but thrive for the obvious reason that
it's good for everybody
right if everybody has a job everybody's
doing well
crime goes down you're not paying as
much for social services
economy goes up look at the comments
you know i don't know how many uh
left leading people are on this live
stream
but check your view of the world look at
the comments it's just
thoroughly yes it's just yes yes yes yes
yes
every single person here literally
everyone it's hard to come up with
something that people would
agree on completely but every person
in the comments just hundreds of them
going by right now they're all saying
yes
every one of them want black americans
to not just do okay
but to thrive for it's pure
self-interest
right even if you think people are just
bastards well you know
maybe that's not too far off right we
human beings
have some rough edges but even if we're
all bastards
it's better for me if black people
thrive
like personally it's like i've been
living in a better world
less complaints less racism less
everything
it's all good so why is it
that this presumably left-leaning person
uh usu or i i hope i'm even somewhere in
the neighborhood of the right
name here um why is it that
he or she i don't even know if it's he
or she
why is it that they believe that there's
all these white supremacists who just
don't want anything to get better
that that that is a viewpoint of exactly
nobody
like i don't think anybody in the world
i i think if you even went into
like at the center of a like a ku klux
klan
rally like literally if you could find
one i don't even know where they are
but if you could find one and attend the
meeting and then ask this question
hey hey guys everybody i know you're all
a bunch of
white supremacists and i know you're
racist but i just have this point of
clarification
if it didn't cost you any money and it
didn't hurt you in any way
would you be okay if black americans
thrived got good jobs had good lives
good educations would you be okay with
that
i'm not positive but i think the clan
would say yes
am i wrong about that i think they would
say yes
wouldn't they now i'm not supporting the
clan
obviously you know they have
they have lots to explain but i don't
think there's
anybody who doesn't want black americans
to thrive
and i'm using the word thrive because
i'm not talking about equity i'm not
talking about oh let's all be equal
i'm saying thrive do great exceed
how many how many white americans
even white supremacists how many of them
are bitching
about asian americans doing especially
well
i've never heard it i've never heard one
person about it
do you know why because asian americans
are working hard
following the rules doing the strategy
that everybody knows works
stay in school stand you know stay on a
jail
don't do drugs guess what it works
is there is there some clan rally right
now oh we have to
stop the asian americans from thriving
no
no people are just happy that we have
more technologists more lawyers more
doctors
more scientists i've never heard anybody
complain about it
so here's what i would suggest
that when you're talking about critical
race theory
and the 1619 project
here's what i think the proponents want
and you see how dangerous this is
because when i say
here's what i think they want am i going
to be
any more accurate than uzu
anya is in imagining what
white people want kazuzu is completely
wrong
like complete wrong planet
not even any people think this much less
most of them
but do we make the same mistake we being
let's say
do white people make exactly the same
mistake in a different way
which is imagining what the other people
are thinking but we're imagining it
wrong
here's what i think i think that if
you're black
and you're in favor of or it doesn't
matter if you're black but if you're in
favor of
critical race theory in 16 19 here's
what i think you want
that the truth is
clarified that the truth of the founding
of the country
is clarified and focused on
and that nobody who is a victim is
ignored
and that the the legacy of slavery
and all the way through systemic racism
are fully known to everybody involved as
a key foundational part of who we are
and why things are the way they are
would that be fair
that that the proponents of these things
just want us to really understand it
i feel like that if like they just want
the truth
you know let's just be honest about what
happened now
do you have any problem with the truth
in the comments tell me how many of you
have
any objection to better understanding
of what the actual situation was
historically in america
is there anybody who objects to better
knowledge
now it's a separate question about
whether some of the
some of the facts are right if you have
to deal with that separately
yeah no objection right but um
i do i've got an objection
not to being accurate but that's all
good
but focus here's where
everything went off the rails here's the
important point
right critical race theory and 1619
are like your friend
do you have a do you have a friend who's
an
what does your friend always say
to you when they say something really
cruel to you and they insult you what do
they say to you
they always say the same thing right i'm
just being honest i'm just being honest
so is it good to have a friend who's uh
just just being honest
it's good to have a friend like that
right don't you want your friend to be
honest
you don't want a friend who's lying to
you do you
yeah you do because the off the
alternative is an
you do want to be lied to you do want
your friend
not to tell you your haircut looks like
 you do want that
you do want him to ignore something
that's
no that's not going to help you you do
want your friend not to tell you it
looks like you gained weight
you probably knew it right so the 1619
project and
and critical race theory as the analogy
isn't perfect right so don't get hung up
on the analogy
i believe that they are well intentioned
and they come from a place that we would
all agree on
which is that better information is just
better
but here's the problem
focus and framing
the way you operate in life and the
decisions you make don't have to do
just with what you know it has to do
with how you
interpret it and how you frame it and if
you frame things wrong
you will be strategically disadvantaged
if you frame things correctly
you will be advantaged and have a
strategic path
that's that's like really superior
all right now what happens
if you're trying to balance these two
things
on one hand you want the truth as clear
as it could be
on the other hand you want to win you
want to thrive
you're going to have to find a balance
and here's the balance i would suggest
certainly we want as much you know
stark truth and honesty about
slavery and all that has become of it
yes we want that
but if you frame history that way
you're telling people that victimhood
is their primary frame if you take
victimhood as your primary view of life
you will not do well but if you take
strategy as your preferred frame
you will almost always do well unless
you have terrible luck
right here's what strategy would look
like
okay kids boys and girls some of you are
white some of you are black
tell me what strategies you would use
and they might be different
to succeed white kid says well i'll go
work for my dad
and if that doesn't work out i'll go
work for my uncle
if that doesn't work out i'll go work
for my mom's brother
and if that doesn't work out i'll go
work for my mom's cousin
because they all have companies and
they'll hire people
then you say the black kid all right
what's your strategy
and the black kid says well i don't have
any family members who could hire me
so i need a different strategy here's
what it is
i'm going to get a good education stay
out of jail don't do drugs
and when i go to a fortune 500 company
with my college degree
which i will get financial aid because
of my poor
uh my economic situation
and i'm going to take my college degree
into a fortune 500 company
and i'm going to get any job i want
because they're dying for diversity the
big companies have to do it
there's there's a lot of eyeballs on
them they have to diversify
they have to promote uh you know black
and brown and women and lgbtq they have
to
they don't have a choice so if you're
black
it's just a free ride you know in a
corporate world
and you're not only not only will you
not be underpaid
compared to white people you'll do
better in the corporate world
now i'm sorry
you are still a shill and a half
we'll be talking about you later i've
got a segment about you
narcissist trolls so
i think you could fix the crt thing in
the 1619
by not going into their frame if you
fall into the question of
is it accurate or not accurate you have
fallen into their frame
don't do that that's the wrong argument
that makes you think past the sale
the sale is whether this should be
taught and focused on
and part of the mainframe of history if
you're arguing about the details being
accurate or inaccurate you've accepted
the frame
don't do that you should say
instead of this which will make you fail
how about we teach you strategy which
guarantees success
there's no contest one is smart one is
dumb 16 19 and critical race theory i
believe are well intentioned
and i love accurate information and i
think students should have it
but if you make it your major frame the
way of viewing things
you've lost your strategic advantage and
then you've moved backwards
so as someone who wants black americans
to
thrive thrive
not get equity not be equal
thrive just everybody does as good as
they can possibly
do that's what i want and i hate
that they're being held back by this
framing of
how to look at history that's my opinion
um did you know i didn't know this still
today interesting factoid matthew
sheffield tweeted this i think there was
a bloomberg article
that if you actually looked at all the
different kinds of taxes between
california
and texas that texas has higher taxes
on the middle class if you include all
the different
types of taxes the middle class is
actually burdened in texas
but the rich uh get
get absolutely creamed in california
but the rich actually do well tax wise
in texas now i didn't look at the
details but i'm just guessing
because i have enough you know
experience with this question
then i'm guessing that rich people don't
spend a big percentage
of their income for like sales tax maybe
not as big a percentage of their income
for property tax or whatever the other
taxes are
so that uh texas ends up being a good
place for
rich californians to move to
when i read this i said to myself you
know
maybe it's not just if i move to cal
texas
maybe i have to i mean the difference is
pretty stark
um all right
let's talk about narcissist trolls uh
just an update
um if you were to find a narcissist
individual they would have often a
set of traits which are very predictable
and common and it goes way beyond oh i
think i'm great that's what you think of
narcissist but beyond telling you that
they're great
narcissists have these weird very
specific
behaviors which you can predict and if
you see them from trolls
it will help you to know that you're not
dealing with a normal person you're
dealing with somebody who's very unique
and very damaged literally a narcissist
and here are the ways which you can tell
that your troll is a narcissist
versus just somebody who disagrees with
you right
there are plenty of people disagreeing
with you on twitter
and social media but they're not all
being narcissists and trolls
right some people are just respectfully
disagreeing some of them just giving you
different information but here are the
tells
for a narcissist number one they
attacked the messenger
or the way something was said
so you'll see me get these kind of
comments and you'll you'll even see the
narcissist
pop up in the comments they're the ones
who say something like this
well you can't believe anything adam
said
and no details we don't even know what
the topic is it's just attacking the
messenger
so that's a standard narcissist behavior
there's also what i call the over laugh
at nothing specific
usually with the lots of the emojis
like hahahaha adam says
ha hahahaha can you believe hahahaha
that he would talk hahahaha then there's
not even a point
that's a narcissist because the
narcissist just wants to put you down
and show that they're like superior so
that's classic narcissist behavior the
over
laugh um the other narcissist behavior
and this is
i'm not making this up this is going to
look
this is going to look as if i made these
things up i swear to god
i didn't make any of this up these are
specific behaviors
that are so predictably common to one
type of person
that you can just laugh at it and walk
away it's like watching a show
and here's another one that you won't
believe is common
until you start watching for it which is
uh the narcissist will bring up
something that the messenger did
years ago how often have you seen that
uh happen to me i'll say something like
i don't know something about covid and
somebody will say
well i don't know if we can listen to
you because what about that thing you
said 10 years ago
that has nothing to do with what i said
today why would you even bring that up
yes i said something wrong or didn't 10
years ago
but it's not relevant i mean
only in the most indirect way
so that's a narcissist approach a
narcissist will bring up what you did
years ago consistently
and other people just don't do that
other people will just talk about the
thing you're talking about
because if you can't argue about the
thing you're talking about
and you have to bring up some unrelated
thing from 10 years ago
you don't really have an argument
michael says i don't have any of
friends but my friends do
well that was worth five dollars um
here's another thing that narcissist
trolls do
uh they will misinterpret what you said
no matter how many times you clarify it
have you seen that have you seen
somebody will say
you know for example say the sky is blue
and the
critic will come in and say you keep
saying the sky is red
i'll say oh no i'm sorry you must be
mistaken i've consistently said
the sky is blue saying it again the sky
is blue
only blue never said anything else blue
blue blue
and the narcissist troll will say i
don't think so
no i don't think so i think uh
i think you're saying the sky's red
it is something that only the
narcissists do they won't take
yes for an answer okay you believe the
sky's blue
i believe this guy is blue can we agree
can we just agree and the narcissists
won't the narcissist will say you're not
saying the sky's blue
no you're not and you're an idiot
because you're not
no please let me agree with you i'm
agreeing as hard as i can
i can't agree harder i'm trying i'm
trying
only the narcissist will not let you
agree with them the other thing they'll
do is
uh and this is freaky if you don't if
you haven't seen it
it's freaky they will misremember what
they said five minutes ago
so they will deny what they just said
even if it's written right there like in
the last tweet or post
they'll act like it didn't just happen
and you'll say to yourself
they know they just said this right are
they just lying
and here's the weird part they're not
lying
that's the freaky part they're not lying
they actually have a legitimate
rewrite of memory that happens in real
time
that's a real thing and it's consistent
it's instant and you can observe it you
can
and you can even trigger it like if you
know you're talking to a narcissist
you can actually just trigger a loss of
memory
within the last five minutes you can
make them say
they did not say what they just said and
you can do it over and over again
and if you think that the person is
lying to you
which i always used to believe you'll be
so
mad and confused what you have to
understand
is they don't know what's happening to
them
they don't know their narcissist they
don't know they're lying because
they're not they're just misremembering
and
they're completely oblivious to any of
it they're just acting like they think
they need to act
all right here's another one and then
ultimately
if you were let's say it's an online
argument and you just crush your
opponent
you show some data that's you know
unambiguous
you've just won the argument you have
just
crushed your troll what happens next
you know what happens next they tell you
that the argument was over something
different
how many times have you seen it
again you'll say sky sky is blue
after they've argued that you've really
said it was red
and then finally if you can nail them
down to yes
it was only about the sky and the sky
was blue
they'll say we were talking about
humidity
and you'll say what is happening
that wasn't even in the conversation and
they will
they will go to their grave saying no
no you're you're moving the goal posts
you're doing it again
you're you're you're changing the
subject
i always said it was about humidity and
it wasn't
it wasn't so
when you see those things don't defend
yourself yeah
so the the effect of that is gaslighting
one of the definitions of gaslighting
but not the common one
uh the common one is that you're
intentionally trying to make somebody
think they're crazy the more
modern uses just that people do think
they're crazy
not that you're trying to make them that
way
how do you deal with it the way you deal
with it is knowing what you're dealing
with
let me let me say this if a robot came
up to you
and insulted you what would you say a
robot let's say
someday not too long from now there's a
robot
that can talk to people and the robot
walks up to you and
says something that's offensive to you
do you get angry
probably not because you're like well
it's just a robot
it's just programming right when you see
a narcissist troll
or in person just think of them as
robots
if they had the option of not doing this
maybe they would
but the specificity of how they act the
the going down what you could call the
narcissist well
you know once you prove them wrong
there's a very predictable
path they take into uh into some kind of
illusion
and once you realize it's just
programmed and they can't help it
and they can never help it and it can
never change it just is amusing
and then you just move on with your life
uh on locals a little bit later today
i'm gonna do a
special micro lesson on how to make
friends
turns out that's a big problem how many
of you have problems making friends
or maybe lately because of the pandemic
any of you have problems making friends
i would love to see in your comments
uh yup yup yup people are saying yes
somebody says no good extrovert there
never nope nope yes nope
yeah i think it's maybe 50 of people or
something like that
um
yeah so you'll get a lesson on that how
to make friends i'll tell you some
specific things to do
they're not creepy and they're easy and
anybody can do them
i've got a a reframe for you
that is going to change some of your
lives
like actually literally within the next
five minutes at least one person and
maybe
maybe more watching this will have their
life
completely transformed by this and
this is a it's a brain hack it's a trick
and i call it reframing
and the reframing is simply taking
something you already know
and just reframing it to look at it
differently
but you're not adding any new
information all right so i won't be
telling you anything new
i'll just tell you how to look at a
thing differently some of you
completely changed your life and here it
goes
do you ever have any problems with your
self-esteem
and taking criticism in particular
when people criticize you how do you
feel
it's pretty bad isn't it it makes you
feel
like you're just nothing makes your
self-esteem
in danger it makes your blood boil it
makes you you can't sleep it's just the
worst thing in the world isn't it
because when somebody criticizes you
it's personal
it's you now that's your normal frame
isn't it
the normal frame if somebody criticizes
you personally
you take it personally because how could
you not
like what's the alternative taking it
personally
right well i'll give you the alternative
it won't work for every person every
time but like i said some of you
your whole life will change in the next
minute
here's the new frame ask yourself this
what options did this remove for me
instead of how does that insult make me
feel what did it do to my self-esteem
you say to yourself what options did
that remove from my life
let me give you an example somebody
walks up to me and says scott
you're bald and you're short
now the old frame
says oh my god i feel terrible people
people not only say bad things about me
but
i'm short and i'm bald that's the way i
used to think about it
here's the way i think about it now what
option did that remove from me
did it stop me from getting rich
nope did it stop me from marrying the
most beautiful woman
in any dimension in our reality
nope nope did it stop me from playing in
the nba
well it turns out my talent is what
stopped me from playing in the nba
my height not so much
i could be pretty tall and still not
make it in the nba
so name one thing in my life
that's different because of the
criticism no options have been removed
everything is intact right
now you say to yourself how is this
going to work
just just answering that little question
how's that going to work because it's
still a personal insult how am i going
to ignore the personal insult
this is how reframing works reframing is
not about what's
true it's about what you're focusing on
what you focus on is your reality
if you take a frame that says what
options did this change for me
and the answer is almost always none
then you're taking a utility frame on
life
the utility frame says what's useful
what's not useful
what's useful what's not useful and then
you take the utility frame
and that part of your brain is not the
part that gets embarrassed and shamed
and self-esteem
it's just the utility part of your brain
just spend some time on the utility part
right
there is physically a part of your brain
that's working on all the negative
thoughts you know the shame and
everything else
just don't spend time there the less
time you spend
activating that part of your brain
feeling bad
the less you're there the better and the
more you spend thinking
what difference did it make somebody
said i wore a bad shirt today i don't
like your shirt
and did that make my grades go down
did that is there somebody who won't ask
me for a date
because i had a pimple on my forehead
probably not
let's say you're in high school and uh
the bully says oh you get a
you get a pimple on your forehead
well the old way is like oh no i'm ugly
i've got a pimple on my forehead the new
way is
did the pimple on your forehead lower
your grade point average
no did the pimple on your forehead cause
somebody
who might have liked you otherwise to
not ask you on a date
nope not a single person ever turned
anybody down because of a pimple on the
forehead
it's never happened never will probably
so this won't solve every person's
problem
all the time some of you
your life just changed and these little
reframes
are so powerful that until one of them
gets you
and one of them will get you they don't
all work for everybody right everybody's
got their own little reframe that works
for them
but once a reframe changes your life
instantly
you're going to understand how these
work they are
immensely powerful immensely powerful
so that's your question next time you
get a criticism from an
online troll here are the two things
you say number one that person i have
empathy for them
the troll the critic because they're
broken
whatever it is that makes them need to
criticize you so cruelly
is a flaw in them and you should have
empathy for them you should feel bad
that somebody is so broken
that the only way they can feel better
is through your pain
the pain they're trying to give you but
you're rejecting so that's the first
thing you think
i'm sorry for that person they're so
broken second thing you think is
what option did any of this remove from
me
and the answer is always going to be
zero and then you move on
so that is your advice for today
and we'll try to see if we can
get an actual interview with dr nicole
sapphire about
her book called panic panic attack just
coming out uh tomorrow i think it's
officially out playing politics with
science in the fight against coven 19.
so i'll see if i can get that to work
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
