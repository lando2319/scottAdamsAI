and i'll put the positive spin on the
bad news
because you know sometimes it's good
and
if you think
that i'm leading you toward
the golden age
i am
here's a little tip
i'm not predicting the gold of age i'm
only pretending to predict it i'm
actually causing it to happen and what's
happening right now is that
i'm nudging you onto what i call the
wait for it
wait for it
listen carefully
oh youtube just went offline
is that weird
right before my punchline
so
uh youtube's offline
hey i'm back
can you actually see me on youtube
nope just lost me again
so youtube just lost me again
huh
i'm gonna run uh i know you care so i'm
gonna run a speed check on my
my uh wi-fi
speed check
here you can watch
see how we're doing
well that looks good
so it doesn't look like a wi-fi problem
right
looks pretty good
let's see if youtube's back
that can't be on my side right
it is anybody uh technical enough to
verify that
um
you're only as fast as your slowest
point yeah of course
huh
interest oh hey hello
are you back
uh
can anybody on youtube tell me if
youtube is having a problem or is it
just my my feed
because i have a good feed ish on locals
all right well let's take it from here
you know you may have interrupted my
flow
have you noticed that if i lose my flow
at the beginning of the show i never
recover it has anybody ever noticed that
sometimes i just have to give up
uh anyway losing my flow is actually my
biggest problem that i have
you know working at home
all right
all right it looks like we've recovered
everybody good
you want to pretend like it never
happened well let's go to this
simultaneous set but all you need is a
cover burger gossip technical chelsea
steiner canteen dragon flash vessel in
the guy fill it with favorite liquid
let's hurry before the technology dies
again go
um oh we were waiting for the punch line
on youtube you missed the punch line
let's see if it makes it go offline
again
all right
it goes something like this
you may not
think
your goes like this
you might think
that i'm predicting we're heading toward
a golden age where everything's better
but i'm not predicting it
i'm causing it
and what i'm doing specifically is i'm
trying to nudge the public onto
wait for it
listen carefully
youtube don't go offline don't go
offline don't wait wait for the
punchline
i'm going to nudge you onto the
sippery slope
you're welcome
the slippery slope
because when you take it oh it wasn't
that bad shut up
shut up
talk about a joke that wasn't worth
waiting for
wow
well it's getting harder to brag
i know this is not a problem for a lot
of you but for people like me
if you are a narcissist
it's it's getting hard
let me give you an example
early in my career i did a dilbert comic
in which i made i
included some reference to garfield the
other comic
now there's a standard within the
cartoonist world
that if you mention somebody else's
comic in your comic
there's there's sort of a custom that
happens after that and the custom is
that the person who was mentioned
will often contact you and say can i
have the original because cartoonists
will collect originals from other
cartoonists
and so when i mentioned garfield and
this is when you know i was basically an
unknown i just started cartooning
i got contacted by jim davis now you can
imagine if you're a starting cartoonist
you know just imagine what happens if
you know jim davis the creator of
garfield when garfield's you know
gigantic
imagine being contacted by the creator
of a garfield
and asking for your original
it's like the coolest thing ever right
if you're just starting out cartooning
it's it's like the pope just patted you
on the head or something
so i of course agreed immediately
instead of my my crappy dilbert comic
with uh with ink that probably
disappeared a week after he got it
i didn't use permanent ink in those days
and
uh don't ask why it's a long story but
so i've got so now i've got this
original garfield
probably at the time it was worth maybe
a thousand dollars you know which would
be
more today
and i thought you know
it's not enough to own one
other people have to see this thing
and i'm like what what is the point
of reaching this pinnacle of my
cartooning success at that point
if i can't if i get a show off
show it to somebody so i took it to my
local framing shop
and here was what i thought would be my
first
my first hit of
you know narcissistic supply
i thought wait until wait until the
person i asked to frame this because it
was where you leave it and they frame it
for you
i thought wait until the person i asked
to frame this
figures out what this is
it's like gold right and these and the
person is going to ask naturally i
figure they're going to say is this an
original garfield and i would say
yeah it is it is
ah yeah it is
and then of course you would follow up
like how is it that you've come into
acquisition of this valuable
property and i would say ah you sent it
to me
if you have other questions you might
want to follow up
oh why why did he send it to me oh oh it
turns out that i'm also a cartoonist
yeah yeah i do a cartoon and it caught
his attention
and he liked it yeah top cartoonist in
the world who's
maybe a living he liked my cartoon so so
he asked if he could trade
that's how i thought it would go
in my mind i imagined myself
fake humbly saying how i got it while he
was like impressed and then i'd feel
some narcissistic supply and i'd be like
feeling good for today
that's what i hoped that's not how it
went
here's how it went
i'm standing in line behind one other
customer there's just three of us in the
store
the the person who owns the place
customer in front of me
and me
custerman in front of me
is getting a
framed garfield
yep
[Laughter]
we both had one
[Laughter]
and then
do you know what the uh
do you know what the store owner said to
me when i brought mine
third one today
now it turns out that was a joke
it was not the third one today but the
fact that there were two of them
talk about deflating my god
now fast forward to last night
all right so fast forward you know a few
decades to last night
my new thing that i like to humbly drop
into stories
not really humbly at all
is that i i once visited the oval office
and talked to the president trump
now if that is let me tell you if that
ever happens to you
or something like it
you're not going to keep that to
yourself
right now i'm worse because
i like
bragging
so i want everybody to know
but i don't want to be like i got
invited to the white house so i want it
to be like subtly
you know maybe it just comes up as a
natural part of the conversation i'll be
like yeah yeah as a matter of fact yup
bendy ovals so i'll do things like
if there's a you know
news program and it shows the oval
office
you know i'll drop in something like huh
looks like they changed the rug
you know just leave that in there ah
looks like is that the same lamp looks
like a different lamp
you know just wait for somebody to ask
the question like well i don't like to
brag but i've been there
yep ivanka gave me a tour of the
furniture in the oval office i
probably happens to a lot of people so
like that
so anyway
so so i like to get my little
narcissistic supply by telling people
that i was once in the oval office
last night i'm at a
you know neighborhood gathering in town
and just talking to the neighbors and
and once again politics came up
and i thought well here here's my
opportunity
i'm gonna i'm gonna just drop this in
here because when you're just talking to
the neighbors like literally the people
live on your block
you know this could be a little extra a
little extra impressive wouldn't you say
because you know often i'm talking to
other public figures and they've done
interesting things too but if you're
just talking to the neighbors
you can really
you can really wow the neighbors
so i was talking to uh
a woman who lives
in the neighborhood and i mentioned you
know i i better be over love is it i met
the president
and she said uh yeah i had dinner with
obama
and i just thought well it i'm just
going to give up
like
well i'm just going to give up
is there is there anybody i can talk to
who hasn't done something better
good lord
what do i have to do
what do i have to do
i don't know
so i know lots of you have your own
problems
and your own problems seem big to you
but you know everybody thinks their own
problem
will you give me a moment for some
sympathy
i've been trying to brag for years and
it's not working out at all
so
i'll just keep trying
um yesterday i saw a straight news piece
that made me laugh for 10 minutes
right
now remember i said that parity and
reality have merged
if you can find a better example than
this
now i'm going to read you
the actual straight headline
and you tell me that it's not a joke
right
try to distinguish between the actual
headline i'm not making this up this is
an actual headline from yesterday
kamala harris's speechwriter quit
it's not just me right
and
i i went to retweet it and add a joke
and i couldn't do it
i couldn't add a joke
because you can't add a joke to the joke
like that's just piling on there was
nothing you could say to that to make it
funnier i just laughed for 10 minutes
and every time i kept to i kept trying
to do a quote tweet
where i'd you know add the
add the humorous
the humorous spin on it there's no
humorous spin you can add on that
well i thought
but it turns out that uh one
professional
oh damn it did i not write that down
oh
somebody had a better joke than i did
quoting quoting the speechwriter
humorously anyway never mind
but i wondered if this would uh this is
generating a whole category of jokes
do you know how letterman used to do the
top 10 list
and he could it seems like they could
always make that funny at least a few
items on it because there's something
about a top 10 list
that just naturally is easier to write
jokes to it's it's a format that you can
easily write jokes to but when i heard
that kamala harris is a speechwriter
quit i thought
i have an announcement too
my hair stylist
has resigned
so this is my public announcement
my hair stylist
has resigned
and if that wasn't bad enough it was a
bad day on my staff
my personal stylist quit
yeah my personal stylist quit
one day i wear a white t-shirt because
it's laundry day
my personal stylist says
 it i'm out of here
um i have some other news about other
people
michael morris personal trainer quit
just resigned walked off the door so am
i wrong that this is a genre we can play
with
i don't understand what that means
somebody just said my gynecologist just
quit i don't know why that's funny
you're not even on the right that's not
even the right theme
[Laughter]
it's funnier because it doesn't work
it's funnier because it doesn't work
oh yeah i know it's a guy that said it
but it's funnier because it doesn't work
[Laughter]
uh well i guess if you're saying i mean
that's a little too far
all right
uh
here's a mystery solved
maybe
um i've been wondering why there haven't
been any gigantic forest fires this year
in california
now if you don't live in california you
have not noticed that they're not here
and i'm pretty sure that we were seeing
them by now last year in the year before
no trees left
we got a few left
and it turns out there was a 60 minutes
report that may have explained why
so apparently we have now
although it's not being as utilized or
used i like to say as much as it could
be
there's a helicopter fleet of rapid
response
um types and and there are big chinook
type helicopters you know the the double
rotors that can
lift up anything and they can carry
enormous amounts of fire retardant but
the big difference is they're equipped
to fly at night
i didn't know this but did you know this
that they stopped fighting fires at
night
at least by air
did you know that because i guess the
regular uh
knife flying is too dangerous
but if you if you use the ones that are
sort of military-grade chinooks that are
meant for all kinds of nighttime things
they can do it safely
and it's much easier to fight the fire
because it doesn't rage as much at night
so you get it at its weakest point
but apparently the idea is for an
enormous amount of money
so like one
one flight of these helicopters is going
to be you know millions and millions of
dollars not one flight but one fire
you know fighting one fire would be many
millions for these helicopters but
um
it's because of the low altitude that's
what makes it dangerous for planes
somebody's saying that makes sense
so
somebody says 23 000 an hour that sounds
about right
but apparently the company that makes
them makes the claim that uh even though
they're insanely expensive it's less
expensive than letting the fire get out
of control and on that i think they make
it actually good argument
now
is it solved you know i had an idea that
maybe is the next generation
i thought that we should have a um a
fleet of drones
that's always flying around looking for
any fires now i guess they're using the
helicopters for that and then night
vision but you could use a drone for
that so i think there should always be
drones in the air
and always looking for forest fires
anywhere in california you know as soon
as one lands another one takes off sort
of thing
so if you spot it quickly i guess that's
half the fight right you could put night
vision on the
easily put night vision on a drone
but
then i thought what if you had a fleet
of firefighting drones
a little too soon for that i don't think
we have the technology but if they were
helicopter drones
could they not do what the chinook did
you know
maybe you just need the human pilot at
this point but but at some point that's
what i think it's going to be at some
point i think forest fires will be
spotted by drones
and then the first phase of suppression
will be drones
and maybe their first drones can't carry
as much and but you got lots of them
right it's just you're just black in the
sky
with smaller drones that don't have a
big payload but
there are lots of them and they're fast
i know i think that's where we're going
but it's nice to know that it's possible
that these helicopters might be the
reason that my sky looks blue
um
all right
so that's good news
um i saw a tweet by uh
twitter user machiavelli's underbelly
who is a real good follow if you're
looking for a good follow on
especially on ai and technology related
stuff
just search for machiavelli's underbelly
machiavelli is spelled just the way you
think it is
all right and
he notes um
somebody else was tweeting there are a
whole bunch of ba accounts
requesting that we go hard with new mask
mandates
and the bots are saying the exact same
thing
it's obvious it's a cut and paste and
has all kinds of different accounts
and as machiavelli's underbelly uh
alleges now this is an allegation but i
don't think it's wrong there's a foreign
entity that is flooding us with bots
trying to destroy destroy america by
you know bringing up the mask mandate
thing again
what do you think
do you think and i do think the evidence
was strong there was a list there was
actually a video list of a whole bunch
of accounts that all have the same thing
and oh you know what if you find it just
do a search on some of the terms and you
can see
within twitter you should see all the
accounts just pop up because it's the
same terms they use
now who do you think would be behind it
do you think first of all
well let me state with
if these are if the accounts shown
really exist
then there is a bot problem
and it's a bot problem pushing masks who
would do that
do you think that a domestic entity
would do that
i mean anything's possible but it seems
very unlikely i i don't see a domestic
so what do you buy that if it's a
bot attack is foreign
i think it's foreign
yeah you could argue that maybe you
would help somebody in the election but
that's a little murky isn't it i don't
really see how that's going to help any
american
not really
so i feel as though it's got to be
foreign and who would be the most likely
culprits china or russia
china or russia
china
you don't think russia
isn't russia more implicated in
bots
both
say both well this is a specific attack
so i mean it's
iran
yeah
it feels chinese but that's just a guess
all right
um
so i guess i'm a little late on this
story but
we're still talking about
biden's visit to saudi arabia and he did
a fist bump
with the
saudis crown prince there
and the fist bump
was
even
even adam schiff criticized biden
is that the first time
adam schiff just directly
criticized him pretty
pretty aggressively
and i gotta say
i didn't think i would ever respect
anything that came out of adam schiff's
mouth
but that was exactly the right thing to
do
yeah
i hate to give him credit
but he just went hard at his own party
for something that was perfectly
appropriate criticism in my opinion
can we give them that
let let's see if we can fight with our
confirmation bias and our
and our team spirit duff just to give
them that
right
shift is a piece of he's like one
of the worst human beings i've ever
experienced in public life
just an opinion
but i'll give him that
because he went after his own team and
it was the right goal
now what do you think was in biden's
mind when he did this fist bump
what the hell was he thinking
because the fist bump
it feels to me like that is a clear sign
of
a lack of mental let's say sharpness
did it seem like that to you
i don't feel like that was some cleverly
thought out thing he did
i don't know that it was just a
spontaneous thing and he thought oops as
soon as he did it
i feel like he should have been a little
more prepared for that
and it feels like
um his advisors didn't have control over
that you know it wasn't on a
teleprompter or something
i feel like that was just a sign of age
what do you think
did that look to you like really could
only be explained by his mental decline
you know you have to be careful because
if you're already primed to think that
everything is his mental decline
you know i already debunked that
handshaking thing
where it looks like he wants to shake
hands and nobody's there that's just a
fake video
fake in the sense that they cut off the
fact that he's just gesturing towards
something he's actually gesturing to
where they're going to walk or should i
walk over here or are we going over
there
so if you don't see the whole stage it
looks like he's trying to shake hands
with a ghost but that's debunked
that's nothing
so maybe just like the handshake maybe
we're all just primed to see it as what
it's not who knows maybe he thought of
it
maybe maybe it was intentional who knows
but
it's pretty awkward that we send our
president president over there who said
the khashoggi thing's the worst thing
and they should be treated as a part of
pariah
and then when he gets over there to talk
to the pariah he's like fist bump
fist bump
you know i didn't see it but i'm sure i
wouldn't have liked it
now here's something else in the news
that i want you to shake your head when
this happens i'm going to tell you the
news
and i want to just go
what is happening to us all right here's
the news
that the president went over to saudi
arabia and asked them to pump more oil
and the saudis said that they
they're basically close to capacity so
there's not much they can do
is that the headline you heard
that they're close to capacity so
there's not much they can do right
and then did you read the numbers
so the headline says they're close to
capacity there's not much they can do
what what did the numbers say they could
do where are they they're at about 10
million barrels a day
what did they say they could get up to
because they're right at their cap would
they say they could get up to
13.
they could go from 10
to maximum of 13.
now do the math
that's a 30 increase
are you telling me that if one of the
biggest producers in the world
increases by 30 percent
nobody
notices what
am i wrong that the headline is opposite
of the news
right
the news should have been
saudis potentially could increase 30
percent and they're willing to try
you know it might be hard because they
you know that last thirty percent is
hard hard to get to because you know you
gotta be operating perfectly
but
but
can you just give me a sanity check
am i right or wrong that the headline
was
opposite of the story the headline says
there's not much we can do
the numbers say there's plenty we can do
and it would make a big difference
am i wrong
seriously am i wrong
like what am i missing
well i'm a little worried here because i
feel like
somebody says refining is the issue is
it
that's the only issue domestically
it takes a lot of engineering work to
get the extra
yeah but you know if the story had been
there's nothing we can do because we
can't do it
then that would be the story but the
story the way it was written was
we can go from 10 to 13.
so could our news business be worse
[Music]
okay i've been challenged to work a
drone into this story
because i work drones into every story
challenge accepted
how do i work a drone into the story
about casper well
you know uh
if he needed to transport it
if he had enough drones no just joking
that would never work i don't think i
could work a drone into that story
um
but i tried
all right
you know they say one person can't make
a difference
do any of you think that
that one person can't make a difference
i'm hearing somebody say that we're only
going from 12 to 13 which would be
opposite of the story i just read in
axios so i don't know
maybe it's just the news doesn't know
what the facts are
all right well if you think one person
can't make a difference i would
point you to greta tunberg
nearly deindustrializing germany
so that's on her resume
i almost
deindustrialized germany close i mean i
don't think she succeeded
matt you paid ten dollars to say
garfield is the least funny cartoon in
syndication
matt you may not be aware of this and
i'm gonna give you a shocking revelation
humor
is subjective
humor is subjective
do you know how much money people pay
for garfield
not just to run it but merchandise and
tv shows
people are paying a lot of money for
that thing you say is the worst thing
which in the case there's a whole lot of
people like it
humor is subjective
so thanks uh greta for destroying
germany i guess um
did a little bit less than hitler but
she's
she's making a dent
i mean
i don't think it would be fair i think
you'd agree with this can we agree it
would be unfair
to compare greta tung bird to hitler
can we all agree on that
that would be completely inappropriate
do not compare greta tunberg to hitler
destroying germany
right but can we also agree she's number
two
now if you were going to rank them the
most destructive people in the uh in the
history of the german country
um
she's definitely not number one
we're all on the same page right number
one hitler
but i'm just saying
you know there and there might be like a
long distance right between number two
but once you get down to like number two
very strongly at the top of the list of
all the potential people destroying
german would be greta
so i want to be very clear do not
compare it to hitler she's nowhere near
that bad
but she's number two
she is number two
all right um
i wondered as many of you did when steve
jobs
died
would apple
start making worse products
did you all wonder that because it felt
like he was the secret sauce right yeah
they got all the best designers in the
world and
you know ivy does this and that and blah
blah blah but
um you thought did you think that steve
jobs was like the ultimate guy who said
no that's not good enough
it is in my imagination that apple has
completely lost
the program
with user interface
like user interface was their thing
but i just
just tweeted around i was using an app
as a microphone icon
and then it's working on top of the ios
the os
that has a microphone icon right next
there's two microphone icons that do
different things
one is to create a voice text and one is
to
you know immediately you can send your
voice
now do you think that steve jobs would
have allowed
that there could ever be an app
that would have the same icon on it in
the app store as apple's own icon and
right next to it so you wouldn't know
what the you were doing
you can't even imagine that steve jobs
would have ever allowed that right
and you know giving you some other
examples it does seem that the
and i told you there's
you know five factorial ways to to
cancel the incoming phone call
do you think that steve jobs would have
allowed
five factorial ways to silence a phone
call
[Laughter]
no so let me ask the question oh and
full disclosure
i do own apple stock
so i'm i'm
you know i'm ragging on them but i'm
betting the other way so just just be
aware i'm betting the other way so my
money says they'll be great for a long
time
my opinion is there's something wrong
with that steve jobs
so you know just hold both of those is
true
and
i feel like apple has lost it
in their
the interface part what do you think
is it is any other any other apples
users who who think they've gotten too
complicated and i think that's what jobs
would have stopped
okay i'm not going to read that comment
you could tone that down a little bit
um just you know the locals platform
is free speech
so you know nobody's going to get
blocked on locals
but i'll give you my opinion that that's
inappropriate
comment you know who you are
all right
and everybody's welcome with your
inappropriate comments but i'm not going
to let it go by without commenting on it
okay
so
um apparently the mexican military
captured one of the top drug cartel
leaders the
leader of the guadalajara cartel
now i don't know my cartels too well but
that would that be maybe the
third biggest
cartel
i don't know the cartel you know this
the sonowa might be the biggest i don't
know is it like the third biggest does
anybody know
i i didn't get that from the story
the los the zetas the cineloa
so they might be maybe third biggest or
something
now somebody said uh oh this is good it
means the mexican government is uh
operating against the cartels and here's
you know solid evidence that they're
serious about it because they got they
caught the head of the cartel
what do you think
oh he said no
do you think that's what this story is
that the mexican government now is
getting hard they're going hard against
the cartels
nope
it's sinaloa i don't know what it is
it is sinaloa i guess
thank you
uh no the bigger cartel has friends in
the army thank you that is the correct
answer the correct answer is that
another cartel
controls the military and the government
and told the military and the government
to get rid of their competition
that's what it looks like to me
i'm alleging i don't know this of course
so i'm alleging but it looks to me like
one of the cartels took out the weaker
cartel
that's all it looks like to me if you
hear that the
mexican
military moves against the head of the
sinaloa cartel
then you have my attention
but when the military that may in fact
side with us in a lower cartel i'm just
wondering maybe possibly when they take
out
a business competitor of the biggest
cartel
i don't know if that's telling you what
you think it's telling you
you know what i mean
so here's a question i asked and
you know you always see these pictures
of the coyotes the cartel
employees who are helping the migrants
get across apparently the cartels make
huge amounts of money
charging the immigrants a god-awful
amount to get across the border
and they can't get across without the
cartels because the cartels are
literally guarding the border
on their side
so but when we see the videos you can
always see the
the coyotes
and they're they're real obvious
you know exactly which ones are the
coyotes and you know which ones are the
poor immigrants who are trying to get to
a better life
and i ask you this
why can't we use snipers and take them
out
now we require an act of war or
something probably but we could get that
done
right
now or drones right drones but if we can
see them
and we know they work for the cartel and
we know it's you know they're bringing
in the ringing fentanyl and killing us
by tens of thousands a year
do you think that we couldn't now
politically it would never happen so i'm
not saying this is practical i also live
in the real world where it would never
happen
but remember i also i also suggested
droning the cartels you thought that was
crazy
until the news reported that trump was
asking about it
let me tell you what artists do
that's a
value to the civilization
i read a book on this i forget the
author it's the first time i heard this
idea
apparently there are many examples in
history of where art preceded science
or predicted the future
now you know lots of famous ones like
you know uh
hg
um what is it
who wrote the stories about rocket ships
and stuff like that so artists have
always you know predicted in science
fiction what's going to happen etc
but it's also happened in
science
there there are some artists who
conceived of things before science
actually discovered it was true
and there's this idea that you can't act
until you can imagine something
or you can't find it until you can
imagine it in other words you could walk
right past something that you would
never imagined without recognizing it so
you have to imagine something h
issue wells thank you hg wells predicted
a lot of rocket ship travel and stuff
and
so here's what i'm doing for
civilization
before i mention the possibility of
using military snipers to take out the
coyotes
had anybody thought about it
because i've never heard anybody talk
about it have you ever heard anybody
talk about that idea
oh you have you've heard somebody talk
about it
in public or privately
oh yes but i'm in the military but have
you heard anybody talk about it um
in a political sense in public
so well special forces of course right
but
what i'm suggesting is a little more um
radical than sending special forces
believe it or not
because just
just imagine this visual
there there's a line of you know
immigrants crossing and there's a coyote
usually standing somewhere in the
industry making sure
and you see a video of that happening
and then you see the head of the coyote
just being blown off
and just like his his headless body just
falls into the river
and then repeat
just repeat
just keep doing it and making sure you
get it on video every time
how many videos
of a
how many videos viral videos of a coyote
having his head taken clean off
would you need to publish before a
coyotes wouldn't want to do that anymore
not many right you know the three
you might have to take three heads off
and then nobody would do it anymore
that would be it because it would be on
everybody's phones in mexico everybody
would see it
yeah about three
because our brain our brain forms a
pattern at about three
if you did three people would think it
was a hundred
now am i suggesting it as a practical
matter
i don't know
you know i'm no
international expert
i just know that fentanyl is coming into
the country and killing us
and if he asked me what i would be
willing to do about it if it were up to
me
i would be willing to blow the head
clean off of every coyote
let me say it again
with no moral qualms whatsoever
if it's up to me and i'm president
i'm going to start taking the heads off
of all the coyotes and i don't care
which side of the border they're on and
if mexico complains i will take their
complaint under consideration and they
will blow that off another coyote
and then mexico will complain and
they'll say gosh
you know i feel bad about that but
we're going to keep doing it
and i would just keep blasting coyotes
until nobody got close to it
somebody's asking me if i'm stoned
no
i don't act like this when i'm stoned
i'm usually less murderous
now i'm only murderous when there's a
reason i'm not like murderers in general
no i'm not high as a matter of fact
which would be ironic in its own way
um do you think we could do a
declaration of war against
the mexican cartels i believe we could
we could not do maybe a declaration of
war against the cartels i'm saying
against the mexican government
that would be a bad look but we could
declare war against the cartels
because all you have to do is declare
them international terrorists
am i right
right what's the difference between
uh china shipping precursors for
fentanyl into the cartels and then the
cartels moving in
the the fact that the cartel is just
trying to make money
and and probably their intention has
nothing to do with destroying the united
states but mexico does
i'm sorry not mexico but china does
china has a goal of destroying the
united states through terrorist acts
such as this
so the
the cartels are just working with china
as terrorists
now it's not their purpose they're just
trying to make money
but their functional use is terrorism
so if you tell me that isis had set up
territory in mexico
are you telling me we couldn't get
government approval to take out isis in
mexico
of course we could
we wouldn't even hesitate
so what's the difference between
the cartels what the cartels are doing
and ices
none there's no difference there's no
difference that matters
right there's a difference there's no
difference it should matter to how we
treat it
if you put a deadly risk
in my neighbor's backyard
and my neighbor won't do anything about
it
i'm going to kill the neighbor
[Laughter]
i'm going to kill my neighbor if he if
he does something that's going to kill
me first
of course
so you know if we're acting like oh
mexico is our good friend of course they
are
but it doesn't have any impact on what
you do about reducing your own risk
scott you're fed posting what is fed
posting
is that like i work for the feds
so you think
um
i'm being asked if i would kill the
coyotes if they were trans
no i would not
i would not
if the if the coyotes decide
decide to be trans i would let them go
i would not i would not uh
because i don't want to be part of
making the problem worse
i'm only just trying to solve this drug
problem
but good question
all right
so joe manchin it looks like he's gonna
kill the uh the big climate bill
that would be expensive
does anybody think that mansion is doing
this for any other reason than because
you
he has a lot of coal business in his
state
and they probably support him for
re-election and god knows what else
i mean it's just for the coal but it's
interesting because our system lets him
do that not only lets him do that but
encourages it really i mean he does
represent his state
his state does
benefit from coal
i don't know
i
i go back and forth about mansion do you
have the same problem because on one
hand i think oh he's doing exactly what
his voters want
it doesn't work for us but that's how
the system works and so you know i
accept it as part of the system
but on the other hand don't you kind of
suspect that maybe he's doing it because
big coal gives him money
i don't know that but is it the most
obvious thing you would want to ask
are you getting any side benefits from
big coal in any way
you know it's a question to ask
so it looks like biden is going to fail
completely on this big green energy
thing because of mansion
huh uh
somebody pointed out that his last name
is man chin
it sounds exactly like you know what
he's doing
he's putting his chin out there
all right um
how many uh murderers do each of you
know
i want to do a poll here
how many murderers do you personally
know people that you've talked to
had a conversation with
like actual murderers you're guaranteed
murderers
i i've seen a number of you somebody
said two three
two now i'm not gonna count military
not military
one
one
none
no don't count abortion just for this
purpose don't count it
snipers don't count yeah
one suspected
i i was thinking the other day that i
know too
and i thought how many other
at least three wow
and i wondered how many people know
actually personally know a murderer
the the most famous one
wrote a book about it and he was he he
lived in the cubicle on the other side
of the uh little cubicle wall for me
when i worked at pacific bell
so he worked in marketing
and he was the cubicle like literally if
i'm looking at my computer
he's just there on the other side of the
little wall
and he murdered a friend strangled him
with a belt went to jail and wrote a
good book about it
he mentioned me in the book
yeah one so i think i know one convicted
at least
you know too erica knows too
well
um
you met a guy who said he was an
assassin i once
i once had a friend who said she dated
an uh
a
contract killer
and her story was that in the middle of
night you get a call
and he'd take out his you know little
contract killer gun and
you know with the the silencer they'd
assemble it and they'd be gone for
several hours
they'd come back several hours later
presumably having just killed somebody
and she reports that the sex was
excellent
so apparently if you have sex with a
contract killer
right after he does his job
really good he's really good
so if you're looking to upgrade your
sexual experience
i would recommend a contract killer
all right um
uh somebody says my wife murdered my
inner joy
we'll take that as a as a murder
all right um yes it is
disgusting true but disgusting
all right let me ask you this how many
of you have been in jail i see one
person saying so how many of you
personally have been in jail
mostly knows
smattering of yeses
i assume yet most of the yeses are
probably
you know
young person
mischief
yep oh just just visiting doesn't count
drunk tank yep
that's a lot of people on this uh
well i'm seeing quite a difference on
the
on the locals platform so the people who
pay a subscription to see my extra
content
uh a lot of criminals in this group
compare
you can't see it but compared to the the
youtube answers
on youtube it's no
no of course not no
over a local says yep yep three years
yup yup
it's not quite that bad i'm exaggerating
but it does look like there's a
difference
apparently i attract a criminal element
yeah being a criminal is relative
very interesting
for selling pot
oh my god your ex-boyfriend may have
pushed his next girlfriend off a roof
okay
that's scary
youtubers don't get caught okay that's
funny
all right locals you've been insulted
but cleverly so
so i'm going to repeat it i i said that
there are more criminals it seemed like
on the locals platform and somebody at
youtube says the youtubers don't get
caught
that's pretty funny
i'm going to try to create some kind of
like cattle and sheep friction between
the locals and the youtube people for no
good reason
over on locals they're saying to the
youtubers fu
they stole my wedding ring what
all right so that's enough for now uh
it's kind of a slow news day so we're
gonna let it go
let's uh let's get to our day
and i'm
let me just give you a little summary of
things
did you notice the gas prices are down
right they're still way too high but
they are down right
you have noticed that nuclear plants are
being
not decommissioned as much as they were
even
it looks like even japan is going more
pro-nuclear again
so nuclear energy is up
um i don't think
the next mask mandate which i think
they'll try i don't think it's going to
work
i feel like the public is just about
done with the mask mandates we'll see
but we're close
yeah generation 4 nuclear is being built
in is it wyoming
and
um in my opinion the odds of a nuclear
conflict with russia are
i'd say about
zero right now wouldn't you yeah
so we went from that was a real risk to
now i would say that we're moving our
manufacturing from china
not quickly
but it doesn't have to be quick
we just have to stop moving it there
which i believe has already happened
am i right
we did stop moving it there now
what you're worried about the the
labor coming across the border see what
i did there
did you catch that
i talked about the labor coming across
the border
i didn't mean to do that but that was a
that was manipulative as a hell that was
accidental by the way because i was
thinking he had my point
but
but in a condition where it's hard to
hire one of the biggest problems in the
economy right now is there not enough
people
right there are not enough people to
hire
at the same time we have hoards of
people coming across the border now they
may not be trained in the right ways
but they're going to pick up some of the
slack for things that nobody's doing
so we do have massive illegal
immigration
at the same time we have massive need
for employees
it's not the worst problem
is it
now let me be clear i'm
in favor of strong border control
and i'm in foreign
and i'm in charge
i'm in favor of us ratcheting up or down
our immigration
based on our economic situation
if i were in charge of the border right
now do you know what i'd do
i'd open it up
because economically i'm pretty sure we
needed we need workers more than we need
to stop them you know because there is
crime there is other things coming
but
give me just
you know we don't have all the
information but
do you think that you have the same
issue with illegal immigration
when we need the workers
does it feel the same
and i get that we're you know there's a
crime element coming in with you know
good people right
but this would be exactly the time i
would have opened the border if we had
fully controlled borders
if we had a wall that worked along the
whole border
this is what i would have opened the
door
that's with your brains isn't it
this is a fascinating experience on my
side because because i see the nature of
the comments in real time as they're
going by
and
doesn't it you up to know
that i'm totally strong border always
have been you know you should seal that
border so a kick it can't get
through unless you wanted to
right
so you need you need total control over
your border and if we have high
unemployment
you close it if you have low
unemployment like we do now and
insurance your workers you open it wide
yeah and and what's weird about this is
i know that most of you
almost all of you are really strong
against illegal immigration as am i
illegal i'm very strong against illegal
immigration
but i don't see any pushback to this
and i don't know what's going on
because it's not like any of you are shy
oh open it for illegal immigration well
i see what you're saying but that this
is a slightly different topic
i'm saying that
i'm saying i would let them in legally
you know and track them and
whatever whatever we need to do
but
here's my point and i feel like you
agreed but you don't want to say it so
i'm going to say it again i want to see
if you can go the extra distance
i don't think you can so this is sort of
a challenge to your mental flexibility
could you go all the way
to at the moment because we need the
workers
that the that the illegal immigration is
not a problem
in the way that it normally would be
can you go there
who can go there with me
it's a it's a tough place to go because
if your entire political opinion has
been no no no illegal immigration
now
if you could
release on the fact that they're illegal
for a moment and just
just concentrate on the fact that it's
either good or bad for the economy
is it good or is it bad for the us
economy
mostly no okay
mostly knows almost all those actually
all right
well
all right here's my proposition at the
moment
without doing a deep dive and the deep
dive could change my opinion
on the surface it looks like this is
when i would have opened the doors
on the surface
but there might be more to the story
how many go on welfare i'll bet not
nearly as many
are sucking up resources as are adding
to it but that's what you need the
economist for you need the experts in
this field
all right let me ask you the question in
a different way
are you ready for this
let's say hypothetically and this has
not happened
let's say the best economist that you
know oh okay i'll give you a specific
one this is this is hypothetical
suppose thomas sowell
who is one of the most respected
economists on the republican side
suppose and he has not said this right
this is just hypothetical suppose he
said all right i've looked into it and
while i hate illegal immigration
i imagine he'd say that
i'm just speculating he'd agree with you
i hate illegal immigration first choice
would be controlling our border but
on this narrow question of was that
whether it helps the economy or hurts it
is my opinion that it helps it at the
moment
suppose he said that
now
and in this hypothetical he knows more
about the economy than you do and you
you agree
if thomas sowell
said that at this moment the illegal
immigration illegal immigration is
helping our economy a little bit more
than is hurting it would it change your
mind
just for the short run
go
i saw yes i saw sure
i see some yeses
interesting
i did not know if that would work
a lot of no's now if you said no what
would be your reasoning
if your reasoning is about the illegal
part remember that's the part i removed
from the question
uh safety i don't think safety
here's my problem with the safety issue
is are the immigrants coming from south
of the border bringing in more crime
than the average of the public that's
already here
well let me ask you that does that
matter
suppose you you thought you needed the
workers so economically that wasn't your
problem so suppose that you weren't
worried about the economics
temporarily
but you were worried about the extra
safety problem criminal element
if i told you that and i don't know that
this is true but if i told you that the
average of the people coming across the
border is actually
less crime
than the average that's already here
but of course it's more people so it's
more crime right it doesn't maybe it
doesn't matter to you that the average
would go down
maybe it only matters that there's more
of it
but
if you need that more of it
to operate your economy
that's different
so i think what's happening possibly
i want to i want to open your i want to
open your mind to this possibility
which i do not claim is the truth right
i'm going to make
i'm going to make two claims that i do
not know to be the truth but very well
could be
the first the first claim is that at
this moment
we're in a very strange period of time
where we need the labor more than
we need to stop it
that's the first claim and i don't know
that that's true
i would look through it look to a thomas
soul or something like that to confirm
the second claim
and this is far more speculative
is if you looked at the total body
of uh of illegal immigrants
and i'm not even sure if you should
include the second generation because
it's all connected right
maybe you include the second generation
too to get a really good clean look
is that fair if i were to look at the
crime from illegal immigration
would you allow me to include their
second generation as part of the whole
picture
i think so
if you looked at the first and the
second generation would their average
crime be higher or lower than what was
already here
i think it would be lower
i don't know
and that that's purely anecdotal and
speculative i think it's lower the thing
you don't see if you don't live around
the immigrant community
is how much they really really don't
want to get caught from doing a crime
because the penalty's worse they go back
to mexico or wherever right there's a
bigger penalty
and they know it and they didn't come
here to get arrested and get sent back
that's the opposite of what they want
in every way
i think
they're lowering the crime rate in
america
now let me ask you this
if all they did was bring in a bunch of
people who were
oh can i say this without being kicked
off of social media
give me a pause
i know this would be a close one
you want me to fly close to the sun
yeah i don't think i could do that
yeah it's not worth it all right
so i'll just say that
i think you cannot rule to rule out the
possibility that they're they're
improving the economy and lowering the
crime rate
i don't think you can rule that out
they may be increasing the amount of
crime and if that bothers you that's
that's actually rational
they might increase the total number of
crime because whenever you increase the
total number of people
necessarily you increase crime but you
know every time you have a baby you
increase crime right
did you know that
that
if you ban abortion you've increased
crime you all know that right
i mean not just the crime of the
abortion
everybody gets that
if if you banned all abortions your
crime would go way up
not your crime rate
if i said your crime rate i'd be a
racist
so i don't say that
your total your total amount of credit
there's just more people
more people equals more crime
so if you think that everything that
creates more people
because it brings more crime is bad
be consistent
you know everywhere there's more people
being added to the country you should
say no
i don't want more people i don't want
you to have a baby
don't have a baby
that will add more crime not necessarily
your baby but if everybody had babies
you're gonna get more crime
all right freakonomics made the claim i
think that was i heard a debunk of the
freakonomics claim
there's a book called freakonomics in
which they said
that the reason crime decreased
seemingly everywhere in the united
states at the same time
is that because abortion was legalized
and you're seeing the benefit of fewer
uh
unwanted let's call them babies who are
more likely to commit crimes say the
statistics but i feel like that got
i saw somebody take a run at debunking
that but i don't know if the debunk was
better than the book or vice versa
fewer people at a certain age range
equals lower crime rate that is correct
if you have a higher percentage of
senior citizens in the in the population
that's a good point
why have i never thought of that before
yeah if you have a higher ratio of
senior citizens your crime rate will
blow
theoretically
and that's where we are
[Music]
well scott benefit
what are you talking about
um
more doordash robberies
millionaires seem to love cheap labor
yes
yes you know when i talk about the fact
that i'm friendlier to immigration even
illegal immigration although i want i
want zero illegal immigration
but we also have to deal with the fact
that it exists
um if i seem softer on it and then you
say to yourself well scott that's easy
for you to say because you just get
cheap labor
you're right
you're right that's exactly what you
should say about me
you are absolutely correct that there's
no way
that i'm uninfluenced by the fact that
it benefits me personally of course i am
yeah immigration tends to be a personal
problem
i don't know if you've noticed that
right
uh immigration tends to be a personal
problem if you've had experience with
any immigrants or that world you have an
opinion and if you don't
you're dealing with it on some
conceptual level and that's really
different
but i don't deal with immigration on a
conceptual level completely
so anybody who says i'm being biased
by positive association with the
immigrant community
i want to tell you that's true i am
absolutely biased
by
repeated positive interactions with the
illegal immigrant community
consistently positive
and
i don't know there's nothing i can do
about that right
i mean i could be aware of it i could
call it out i could be transparent that
it exists but i can't make it go away
you know you're you're
you know the whole thing people won't
remember what you said
but they'll remember how you made them
feel i forget who said that famous quote
but that's exactly true with the illegal
immigrant community
i don't remember what they said but i
always remember how they made me feel
and they always make me feel great
so
fairly consistently
how many criminals do you know lots
lots
if you count the ones who haven't been
caught
it's everybody
and pretty much everybody
uh which party do you think immigrants
will vote for well you know famously
people are noticing that it's changing
right
i think the funniest thing is that the
democrats think
that the hard-working immigrants who
understand motivation and how motivation
and economics work because they're
they're
you can't get closer to it than an
illegal immigrant that's as close as you
can get to
human motivation
equals profit right like they're living
it to imagine that the people who come
out of that experience
will turn into democrats
maybe
[Laughter]
maybe
but
i live in the real world
um
but let me let me tell you a little
secret well here's a california secret
get into any you know mixed
group of people and then where i live
it's always mixed right there's
you don't have
it's pretty rare to be talking to a
bunch of white people in california
there's always there's always a mix
and then
privately peel off you know one of the
brown or black ones
in your group and then talk about
politics
you get a really different feel it
doesn't
i don't know if it's a local thing or
what
but i don't get anybody born in another
country who is democrat
people born in other countries actually
i'm thinking of some exceptions now so
i'm exaggerating too much there are some
some exceptions
but
i'm always surprised
when somebody born in another country
came over here worked hard you know made
something of themselves they're
obviously they lead
republicans
because everything they did was a
republican plan
work hard stay in a jail
you know go to school
take care of your family
this pure republican
dogma is just it's their own version of
it and when they get here who are they
going to religion yeah belief in god
stevie says i'm so naive
here's what i think i think that because
there are a lot of
hispanic democrat voters at the moment
we imagine that that's
that's how it will always go
but i think the democratic party of
today
is such a turn off that an immigrant
today being exposed to both of them for
the first time
would say well one's talking about
pronouns
and climate change that i don't even get
it's not my problem at the moment
and the other is wants to lower my taxes
and
you know it's tough on crime and
says work hard like what do you what do
you
yeah
and and the hispanic community is not so
big in the
latinx
names i mean that's all just coming from
democrats
um yeah
everybody i know who came from mexico
uh loves capitalism
that's why they came here
all right i believe we have exhausted
all our topics
and we have
come to the conclusion of one of the
best things that's ever happened it's
called coffee with scott dams i will
design the mug still working on it
it will be the most awesome thing ever
and tomorrow i'll be back
i'll be back
if not tonight oh
so at the moment
you know i don't know exactly what my
plans will be today
but there's a good chance i might do a
man cave episode tonight
and
if i do i do that without youtube
so we'll do a test of the
locals video and audio because it could
be that i'm running both platforms at
the same time it might be something
happening at my end
i will try to not leave out the east
coast by doing it earlier if i do it
that will be my potential plan
alright
good to see all of you maybe i'll see
you later
bye for now
