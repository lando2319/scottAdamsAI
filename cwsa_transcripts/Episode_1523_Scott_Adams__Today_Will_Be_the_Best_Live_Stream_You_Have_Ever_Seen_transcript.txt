well good morning everybody and welcome
to
the best part of life the best live
stream in the entire world possibly the
best entertainment of any kind anywhere
in the entire simulation the multiverse
the solar system
in fact infinity itself since the
beginning of time the big bang and
possibly before
we're not sure what space space-time is
all about
but i like to cover all bases and if you
came here for the simultaneous sip
and
all the smart people did i know that for
sure all you need is a cup remover a
glass of tanker chelsea signed a canteen
drug flask vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
get ready
did you make it in time did you make it
in time you're rushing you're rushing
grab your cup no
[Music]
you made it in time
good job go
well if you uh are on youtube
right now
you don't know that last night i gave a
live stream drum lesson beginning drum
lesson to my local subscribers
and i was testing a theory that a
beginner
can teach another beginner
better
if they're a good communicator than an
expert and the theory goes like this
that once you become an expert
you eventually forget
what a non-expert knows
but if you're still a beginner but
you've picked up a few tricks
you know exactly what to tell another
beginner it's like whoa don't make the
mistake i made they won't tell you this
for like a year
but you need to know this
and
i heard feedback that it worked
so i'm just going to put out that
concept
that for some
um for some kinds of learning
a beginner who is good at communicating
would be exactly the right person
um
if you didn't see the controversy where
barbara corcoran insulted whoopi
goldsberg goldberg's a
coveted weight game
on the view
well
you should
i don't have anything to to add to the
story because the story's kind of
complete just the way it is
that
i i think i think maybe the takeaway
from this story
is that no matter how smart you are
and no matter how experienced you are
and no matter how rich you are and like
this would describe barbara corcoran she
made billions of dollars building her
own real estate empire from nothing
right
so imagine how much capability
barbara corcoran has a lot
right like super smart capable and all
this lots of experience on tv from being
on
uh
uh
what she called show anyway
and she actually makes a fat joke on tv
on the view
now
i'm pretty sure i wouldn't have made
that mistake
would you
would any of you have made that mistake
now apparently they're they were friends
or friendly and she thought she was just
you know kidding a friend
but
my god
that was a pretty big mistake
now
i also think that she didn't you know it
wasn't
um poorly intentioned
and so yeah as mistakes go
it was just a dumb mistake but it makes
me feel good
when you see somebody who operates at
that level of capability
do something that none of us would do
you know we would have seen this one
coming a little bit sooner than she did
i don't know it was just sort of a
feel-good story
in the sense that somebody that capable
can do something so dumb
in public
now let me ask you this
i've told you before that
a
uh
let's say invulnerability to shame and
embarrassment
is a superpower
now barbara corcoran has done something
that well i guess for normal people
would they feel ashamed and embarrassed
and you know they'd have to
crawl under their bed for a month
do you think she does
i don't know i mean i can't read her
mind but i'm just wondering
i'm gonna speculate
that by the time you're operating at the
level she operates at you just don't
feel shame and embarrassment the way
ordinary people do
you know i'm sure it wasn't a good day
right you know
probably ruined her day
but
will it last
nope nope she probably already shook it
off
she apologized what else do you want
really
um
two movies on one screen dave chappelle
of course has a new special you've all
heard about it
and he has some jokes that uh
the that are
i guess roughly about the lgbtq
community and some funny stories got
there i haven't seen it yet but the
reporting on it
gives you two movies
two movies one is that
dave chappelle said things that were
disrespectful or insulting to the lgbtq
community
and i don't know if he did or not
because i didn't see it
i'm guessing no though
because that's sort of not his deal
you know he's not really about
punching down
is he now do a fact check on me
i've been watching him for a long time
and i'm not really aware that he's ever
punched down has he
in any mean-spirited kind of a way and
so here are the two movies one is that
you know one of the most prominent
successful uh comedians
uh insulted the lgbt community and so
they're outraged that would be one movie
but i'm seeing a slightly different
movie
slightly different movie
chappelle is a different class of
comic or comedian whichever word they
prefer
then
the average comedian i would say and i
would say that he is sort of in a class
where
when he starts making fun of the lgbt
community in a
not mean-spirited way because i'm sure
it wasn't
he's sort of signifying their arrival
right
because he doesn't punch down
if he doesn't punch down
and he's talking about you
what has he told you
you made it
you made it
you can be like white people now or like
adult white males
you can take a joke now
you made it
that's the only thing i see
now i'm not saying that i have the
priority opinion on this right if your
opinion is different that's your opinion
of course you're certainly welcome to it
but but it should be
i think is worth noting that there are
two completely different movies playing
one in which
the
lbgtq community was insulted
which i never approve of
being a
i'd like to think a pro lgbtq
kind of a guy
pro people in general so i can be pro
everything it's easy to say
um but that was it
i feel like welcome to the club
so lgbtq community welcome to the club
um
i'm sure almost all of you can take a
joke so
let's uh let's let's at least at least
consider the possibility that there's a
little positive in this story
because you have to
let me give you some advice
you can't trust anybody
that's part one of the advice
and then you're thinking well that's
pretty negative i can trust people
you can't trust people about a specific
thing they've promised but here's what
you can trust
that people will be the same people that
they were yesterday like people don't
change into a new person so you can you
can
pretty much trust that people will act
about the same as they've acted lately
if they were a liar yesterday
probably a liar today
if they were not punching down
yesterday probably not today it's
probably not the way they were thinking
of it
so
um
so that's enough about that a story
about a man who plunged
i don't know if he jumped or he fell but
he plunged
a hundred feet from a ninth floor story
in new jersey from a high rise and he
landed on top of a bmw
you know collapsed it
and survived with a broken arm
he survived
with just a broken arm
he fell nine stories
100 feet and demolished a bmw
well there are several things that we
can get from this
um
number one if he was trying to end his
life and i certainly do not support that
so i would discourage anybody from doing
it but if they've decided to do it
there is a better way to do it
you should at the very least
not aim for the bmw here's why
should you survive
i'm pretty sure you're liable for paying
to replace the bmw am i wrong
if you survive
i think you're on the hook for paying
for it aren't you
and the bmw being kind of a sturdy
vehicle may be exactly the right
composition
for
keeping you alive which may not be your
intention
so my advice would be
first of all don't try to end your life
don't anybody try to do that
but if you are
and you're not going to take my advice i
would say at least aim for the prius
aim for the prius
this is the kind of advice you're not
going to get on a lot of podcasts
no a lot of podcasts are just blah blah
blah
but you come here
i give you the practical kind of advice
the stuff you can use
aim for the prius
because if
your attempt to end your life doesn't
work
well you're still on the hook for paying
for the car but now it's a prius
bmw
bad risk management now the other part
of this story that i found interesting
is that his only injury was a broken arm
tell me
how do you fall on a bmw from nine
stories up
and not have a concussion anybody
anybody how do you not have a concussion
well hold this story in your head
just hold on to it for a moment put put
a little pin in it
and and put it on the shelf but don't
forget it because it's going to come
back
all right so just put a little shelf
hold it there
moving on to the next story you heard
about the nuclear submarine that was in
the
south china sea and it ran into
something
we don't know exactly what it was but
ran into something and it damaged the
submarine and injured
a number of the people on it
now there's no reporting on what that
object was
what do you think it was apparently
there is history of one of our
submarines running into an underground
mountain
uh
don't they have some kind of technology
in those submarines to see
detect what's ahead of them
uh that would maybe detect a mountain
i don't know exactly
don't know exactly
uh why a submarine would not be able to
see a mountain but we do have a history
of one that ran into an underground
mountain
don't know how
but i'm guessing that we're not often
running into stationary mountains
because of the sonar and whatnot
and you'd think that they'd have the
the ocean bottom at least a better map
down than that
do we really not know where there's an
underground mountain i don't know i have
lots of questions about that
but
um if i'm going to add some guesses to
what they may have run into allow me to
add the following guests
chinese
made
underwater drone
submarine drone those exist right so so
the first part of the story is yes there
are such things as underwater drones
if you were china and you wanted to
discourage people from doing exercises
in your waters but you didn't want to
start a shooting war
but you did want to
maybe bloody a nose
leave a little doubt
how would you do it
i would bump
bump
a drone into a submarine
i wouldn't make it explode
but i'd bump it
i'd give a little uh
just a little little black nose or not
black nose black eye
you know bloody nose
i don't know if that's what happened
but maybe here's another thought you
know we've talked about ufos
and at least some reports of the ufos
going into the ocean
now if you were in advanced technology
would you be more interested in
the stuff that's above ground
or the stuff that's underwater
don't you just assume that they'd be the
most interested in us the above ground
stuff
but there's very little above ground
stuff compared to what's under the ocean
now imagine you had the technology to
come to earth from a faraway planet and
buzz around
do you think you'd care
if you were flying through oxygen
or water
probably not
your ship would probably be so good that
you'd prefer the water now look at the
amount of water there is compared to
land
theoretically
i see no reason that ufos wouldn't spend
most of their time underwater
because that's where more stuff is
more real estate more things to look at
after they've looked at people
like okay we've seen that let's see
what's under here
maybe they ran into a ufo i'd say the
odds of that are low because they have
good technologies and those ufos i've
heard
now since we have a submarine that ran
into something it apparently got dented
or there were their injuries i'm
thinking to myself what kind of
technology
could we employ in our underwater uh
technology our submarines how could we
build a submarine with something that's
stronger than whatever they have now i
don't know is it titanium
is it steel what do they make submarines
that enough but what would be stronger
than those things
well definitely not a bmw
because a bmw was just crushed by a by a
guy
but
he didn't have a
head injury
the guy who who crashed into the bmw
from nine floors up
i'm just gonna put that out there that
we should make our submarines out of
whatever his skull is made of
because whatever that guy's skull is
made of
he survived a nine story drop onto a
metal object without a head injury
i'm just saying we should build our
submarines with whatever that is
i'm no scientist so i don't know the
details of how you do that
but we clearly have a material that's
available to us here on earth this man's
skull
that's probably better than these damn
submarines so let's two plus two is four
let's get it done
uh breaking news the u.s jobs report
falls short again
and only hired uh less fewer than 200
000 people but estimates were up to half
a million so that's not so good right
that's not so good
the
far fewer people got hired
it's probably misleading
here's why it's misleading
the problem i think is that people are
not taking the jobs
that's more like a good problem
a bad problem
is there are no jobs
you don't want to live in that world
that
no thank you that's the depression you
don't want to live in a world with no
jobs
you want to live in a world where all
the the stores have a you know uh hiring
sign and they just can't hire enough
people
that's where we are now it's a bad
reason that we can't hire them because
they're
living a home and taking benefits or
whatever they're doing
um
but it's not the kind i'm going to worry
about in the long run because in the
long run that just adjusts on its own
you don't have to do anything you just
wait you wait people run out of money
they go to work
not a big problem
let's talk about the
nobel
peace prize
um
you know that the nobel peace prize has
now has been announced
and all eight winners of the uh
2021 nobel prize in medicine
chemistry physics and literature
have been men
oh
reigniting a recurring debate about
diversity and not highly coveted awards
particularly those in science
and um i thought i'd give you sort of an
overview
of
how things have changed in the nobel
prize yeah as you know it's the most
prestigious
prize anybody could get in the world i
think
and
you know how we think of it has changed
a little bit over the years i thought
i'd catch up if you're not up to date on
this
now because i'm a professional
cartoonist
i can do diagrams a little bit better
than most people i think
i think i nailed it in this case
so in the old days
the focus of the nobel prize
was about the the brain area so sort of
the part within the the skull
portion of the the human and we'd say
wow these are really smart people and we
would honor them
and it would honor science and great
accomplishment and it was very
dare i say
brain focused
and that seemed okay but today it seems
you know like really old thinking
doesn't it
you're like oh all about the brain oh
thank you grandpa
a bunch of boomers
you still care about brains and
accomplishments
you know let's so we updated that all
right we're a little bit more
progressive today
and today the new focus of the nobel
prize
quite rightly i think you'll all agree
with this is more on the crotch area
far less focus on the brains now i'm not
saying the brains don't matter
because everybody who got a nobel prize
is very very smart and certainly
employed their brains to get there and
so they have very good brains but we're
not really focusing on that
it doesn't feel
it just doesn't feel 20 21 does it
to focus on the the brainal area
that's what's called the brainal area
for those of you who are not as
scientifically literate as i am
so the new focus quite properly is on
mostly penis yes or no
but not by itself
so now it's
let me move this a little bit
now it's more complicated
a little bit more complicated
because it's not
it's hard to get my monitors here it's
not just about the penis yes or no to
get the nobel prize you would also have
to know the self-identification for
example
there could be somebody who had a penis
but identified as female
and then that would give you some
diversity
within the the winners because right now
we have a whole bunch of people with
penises winning nobel prizes
uh and
if you
that's that fair
but it's not just about that it's about
self-identification and then of course
the most important issue of all is the
race
so we need to get you have to get the
right race
otherwise your prizes will sort of lose
their
support people won't respect them
anymore and
the whole system falls apart
so um that's the change
and i think it's progress
a lot of you are still neanderthals and
you're saying to yourself oh make it
about brains an accomplishment yeah
yeah why don't you go back to your
troglodyte caves
with dave chappelle
and uh you know maybe come back when
you're a little bit more awoke
and you know what's important
that's important
right there
take a look at that that's what matters
depending also on how you identify right
and then brains still good
you still have to have they're required
i don't want to minimize brains
you know my god brains are important
i'm just saying they're not as important
as they used to be or when we were
back in the dark ages we're like oh
brains are everything no they're not
um somebody asked me why don't why don't
i make a dilbert drawing and turn it
into an nft and sell it for
millions before lunchtime and i said
that's not going to work because i
already made a couple of dilbert nfts
and they didn't go for nearly a million
dollars but then i realized
what happens when i die
right
i'm pretty sure they go up in value when
i die now i don't give financial advice
so this is not financial advice but
generally speaking when an artist dies
their products go up in value
so
again this is not financial advice but
if you see me with a
dry cough
just take that into consideration when
you make your nft purchases
that's all i'm saying mike cernovich
asked this question on twitter
he said what person or media outlets do
you generally trust and by trust i mean
you would tend to believe that person or
outlet was giving you all the facts in a
well-rounded and complete way
and there were lots of answers that lots
of people mentioned me
as somebody that they would trust
and i appreciate that there were a
number of other names you know
a lot of them you would recognize they
tend to be the independent voices
and i thought to myself
is there something evolving here or
self-evolving
in which
the independent voices
become sort of an important fact checker
at least on the logic and
and bias and cognitive dissonance and
that stuff of of what you're seeing in
the news
i feel as if
there is
sort of developing or evolving
a set of trusted outsiders
of which i get lumped into you know so
you got your you know your jordan
petersons and your
uh yeah i won't name names because
there's lots of names i could throw in
there and you're gonna say you left one
out don't leave one out
yeah
so i feel as if of we're getting close
to the point where it's somehow gonna
get organized to the next level either
self-organized or somebody puts together
a book or it becomes a website or
somebody develops a system or a process
by which every news story
can be bounced against the independents
let me let me put a little more uh
uh bones on this idea or meat on the
bones
uh apparently youtube and google are
going to demonetize people that they
call climate deniers
obviously climate change deniers
because allegedly we have a client a
climate so
um
so you got that happening but is that
the best way to handle news that you as
the platform
believe might be misleading or take
people to the wrong place
demonetizing it
is a dangerous kind of anti-free speech
way to go
the alternative would be i'll just put
this out here
what if youtube instead of demonetizing
climate deniers
simply gave you a link to
a basket of people who would give you a
broader context
people who are neither deniers nor
you know avid supporters
maybe people who haven't even decided
but just people were not lying to you
just people were not liars who are also
paying attention
right
that that could help you a lot in the
same way that
i guess this is a bad analogy bill do it
anyway in the same way i talked earlier
how a beginner might be better at
teaching a beginner
maybe you don't need the scientist to
help you sort everything out you need
them also right don't ignore the
scientists but maybe you also need
just some people who have just looked
into it more than you have
and you know they're not liars
and you know they're not crazy
and you know that you know they have fu
money or whatever and they just don't
have a financial incentive to lie to you
and i think the only people who don't
have a financial incentive to lie to you
are the people who don't know who their
advertisers are
right
the fact you know i i make
some small amount of money on
advertising when it runs on youtube when
they don't demonetize me
and
i don't know what the advertisements are
for because i'm not the one who runs
them
but the moment i take advertisement like
you know i talk to an advertiser and say
i will take your money
and then i'll associate it with this
product
do you think i wouldn't be influenced by
that
i mean i take great pride in trying to
be not influenced by things but i would
totally be influenced by that
i could try hard not to be i could i
could honestly want to not be influenced
by it
but that's not how money works
money just influences
you can want it not to
you could want it not to all you want
and then it does
because money is influential you can't
you can't remove that from money
money has influence here's some money i
just influenced you
no matter how much you swear i didn't
on average i did maybe not every time
but on average money influences
so if you're accepting advertisements
for some big advertiser you can claim
you're not biased
but there will be stories you don't
cover
and there will be points of view that
you might minimize
what is clank
a lot of people on youtube are saying
clank does that
refer to something
or do you hear a noise
i can't tell what's going on here
sticks and clank
clank is uh sticks in the hammer 666.
uh okay
why
you can say clank all day long but i
still won't know what it means but
you're welcome to keep saying it
it'd be good if you
no noise spoon clankers yeah i don't
know what that means so stop saying it
if you think it's useful
um
biden's approval we talked about how bad
it was but there were a couple points in
that i didn't quite
uh see before
fifty percent i this this was quite a
pack poll
cnn reported this 50 said biden is not
an honest president
he ran on honesty
he ran on honesty
coffee spoon goes clank
oh he clicked for yours to brain train
his audience like dogs
yeah i have no idea what you're talking
about
okay
i will ignore it again
um i would think the good trump slogan
for 2024 he'll never do this but just
because it's funny
um i'm going to turn off
youtube i think
should i turn off youtube because you're
ruining the show with
whatever this clank thing is
for some reason over on youtube all the
comments that say the word clank and
they won't explain what it is i guess
supposed to know what that means
should i turn it off
oh clankers are sticks followers i'm
hearing over here on um
he's a youtuber
so what's that got to do with anything
all right
a good trump slogan would be
uh
let's go brandon
now he's never going to do that
right
he's never going to do that
but it would be hilarious if he just
said my slogan is let's go brandon
it'd be funny
um john thompson on twitter
cleverly thought that we should build
that into biden's slogan brandon builds
better
brandon builds better but i pointed out
as a professional humorist that you
should save the joke part to the end of
the end of it so it'd be funnier to say
build back brandon
for biden's slogan to mock his slogan
and then uh john countered my counter by
saying build build better comma brandon
build better brandon
instead of build back better build
better brandon
um none of those things
are going to happen but
they're funny
i uh
i have this fantasy of trump running for
a second term and changing his
personality
now of course the problem would be he
wouldn't get elected if he changed his
personality but sort of in my mind i
think wouldn't it be
funny
if he just never insulted anybody or
said anything provocative the entire
second term and the news would go crazy
because you know once he's elected for a
second term he doesn't need the
publicity as much
to get it reelected some future time so
what if he just played against type and
just completely never insulted anybody
it wouldn't be fun right
and as i'm thinking literally as i'm
thinking that i read this headline today
uh this is how the headline is written
i'll tell you it's it's fake news but
this is the headline
trump says many haitian migrants quote
probably have aids
so
let's just say that
my fantasy of trump softening his
rhetoric
and being a little less provocative
well it doesn't look like that's going
to happen
it doesn't look like we're going to have
any softening of the rhetoric
but this of course is fake news why is
it fake news
listen to the the way the headline is
written and then i'll tell you the story
doesn't support the headline so the
headline says trump says many haitian
migrants could probably have aids
what do you hear
well what you hear
is the press who will absolutely
definitely
be turning this into trump says haitians
have aids
as in all haitians have aids
as in the most racist
i don't know
maybe thing you could possibly say but
did he say that
do you think he said that
the headline says he said it
that many haitian migrants quote
probably have aids
here's the problem the part they put in
quotes is probably have aids
here's what he said
uh these will be
says many of those people he's talking
about the haitian immigrants because
many of those people will probably have
aids
many of those people will probably have
aids
and if they're coming into our country
and we don't do anything about it we let
everybody come in
so we have hundreds of thou or
hundreds of thousands of people flowing
in from haiti haiti has a tremendous
aids problem so here he is giving
context
aids is a step um
aids is a step beyond a's is a real bad
problem trump told i mean i think he
means step beyond even covet
i assume that's the context but here's
the here's the problem if you take out
this sentence
the haiti has a big aids problem
it's really
it's a sympathetic statement about haiti
they have a big problem
and they would import this problem at in
some amount to us if we let them end
without checking
now you could argue that we should or
should not do that separately
but do you think that this headline has
captured that because they take the many
part
where where he's he's now saying all
haitians have aids they take the many
part and they separate it out of his
quote
they do say he said it
but it's not in quotes the many part so
your brain
your brain erases the many part
and it looks at the quote
the many there were many should have
been within quotes
because if you put the word many within
quotes you say many people from hate
from haiti have aids you say to yourself
oh i don't know that might be true
like you know if you have some sympathy
for the haitians gosh there are too many
of them who have this terrible problem
it doesn't sound like anything except a
statement of what's going on over there
and it's pretty bad
as soon as you move the many out of the
quote
that's fake news
because it's misleading even accurate
it's accurate the headline is accurate
it's just misleading
elon musk is moving his tesla
headquarters out of california moving it
to austin
and one of his reasons was he said it's
tough for people to afford houses
meaning california and people have to
come in from far away there's a limit to
how big you can scale
in the bay area
there's a limit
to how much he can scale up his business
because the bay area would you know
limit the people who could afford to
live there
i love how big he thinks now who knows
if this is the only reason are there
more reasons or he's just mad at
california he likes texas it could be a
political statement in part who knows
could be many many reasons
but
i love the fact that the reason he gives
sort of suggests that the size of tesla
is going to be enormous like even bigger
than it already is which is enormous so
i just love the way he thinks he's
thinking in the grandest largest scale
all the time let's go to
bars all right
um there's some new uh
research on sleep that apparently sleep
is not just good for you in all the ways
that we know but they've discovered that
there's a kind of a
this is a weird term for it but kind of
a brainwashing that goes on on
so when you sleep apparently there's
some kind of
synchronization of your neurons that
allows
this
this chemical to sort of flush out your
brain
it's a cerebral spinal fluid
that rushes into your brain when you're
sleeping
filling in the spaces left behind
uh it kind of like
clears out the gunk
and and the thinking is that
if you don't get enough sleep you're not
going to clear out the the crap in your
brain and it would lead to
alzheimer's
uh because they think there's some
connection there
now i'm going to call
maybe fake news on this or
it's not news so much as
so
you're ahead of me so somebody says that
scott's problem because as you know i
famously don't sleep very much
but i'm going to say i don't believe
this
science
because here's what i observe and i
always look for a congruity between what
science says and what i observe
now it doesn't mean that what you
observe is the right one could be the
science is the right one but if they're
out of whack that's a red flag
you know for example science says that
smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer
and sure enough i observe that most of
people who have lung cancer smoke
cigarettes
fits
okay but when they when you observe
something every day and it just doesn't
fit what the science is telling you you
should at least ask the question right
doesn't mean the science is wrong but
here's my
pushback on this
my observation is the people who don't
sleep much
and this is a generalization doesn't
apply to every person the people who
don't sleep much
use their brains more
meaning that they're awake let's say
three or four more hours than other
people
and during that time their brain is
active
they might be learning something doing
something etc and there seems to be a
correlation between uh how much you tax
your brain
and how much you can put off alzheimer's
see so there's there's a little
interplay here between
keeping your brain active and learning
new things and exercising it which
people who don't get much sleep
do a lot of because we're just awake
more hours
i i do a full day's work before most of
you wake up you know that don't you
you know except for the east coast of
course
but i do the equivalent of two or three
lifetimes i think
in the time that you spend doing one
if
if i get alzheimer's
and i suppose i'm jinxing myself now
um i'm not really the demographic
that is likely to get it
because i exercise continuously yeah i'm
always exercising i have the right
weight and i challenge my brain by
learning new things even at my current
age
so i'm doing all the right things diet
and exercise and
brain exercise
um but what i do wrong clearly is
getting enough sleep that might
allow my brain to flush out in this good
way
i'm going to guess
that i would be less likely to get
alzheimer's given the things that i do
right
than someone who doesn't do those things
as right but gets a lot of sleep
and then weed of course
makes me better
i don't know if that's true i just like
it matthew mcconaughey
broke his silence about whether he's
going to run for governor and
he looks like he's leaning against it
because he doesn't think he could make a
difference he's worried that whatever he
did there just wouldn't be enough
difference
now
that's the least surprising thing i've
heard i i never thought he was going to
run for governor
there is something about matthew
mcconaughey
that bugs the hell out of me
and i want to see if any of you have the
same experience
now as an actor
he's great
like
you know if he's in a movie i'm more
likely to watch it than not
i can't think of a single movie i didn't
enjoy his performance
great actor well you're one of our best
in terms of just you know star quality
and you'd like to see his his old deal
but when he does his commercials or when
he he's just talking as himself
there's something that bothers me and i
and it wasn't until today that i could
figure out what it was
and here's what it is
it's the uncanny valley
it's not the way he looks necessarily i
don't think it's his physical look
there's something about his personality
that isn't registering as quite human
anybody else get that
so
you could google uncanny valley so i
don't have to re-explain that because
i've explained it too many times but
it's when something is close to looking
human like an android but not quite
there it gives you some kind of creepy
revulsion
because he's like wait
you're almost a human but you're a
zombie ah that's gross or you're almost
a human but you're an android ah that's
gross somebody said zuckerberg has the
same vibe
yes
in a different way
there are real people who because of the
way they present themselves
look a little off model
and in uh makati's case
if i had to guess
i feel like maybe his the way he
presents himself on camera in public
probably different than he does in
person
probably
it looks like he's acting a little bit
but since he's trying to be a real
person
the
acting to be a real person makes it look
like there's something wrong
i feel like
here's my guess
and with all due respect to matthew
mcconaughey who by all reports seems to
be quite an excellent person very
talented
i feel like there's a genuine matthew
mcconaughey
that's
we're not seeing and i'd like to
because by all reports pretty awesome
guy i feel like he just needs to
remove a layer of
a little layer of artifice
that maybe
he doesn't even know he's putting on
there
just
a little advice i don't know because i
have a positive feeling about him just
in general
but that thing i don't know
sometimes we all need a little uh
a third party to say you know i'm
looking at you and
some some is off maybe you could adjust
that a little bit
by the way people say say the same sort
of thing to me i mean a different topic
but as a public figure believe me
i get plenty of advice
and i have to say that i've told you
this before when you get criticisms as a
public
entity entity or person
the
recording that should play in your mind
as you're being criticized
is pitching
people are giving you free money
they're telling you how to be better and
being better is free money
so yeah it is criticism and it hurts and
it hurts your feelings and you your ego
is damaged
but
cha-ching
if you're gonna do something about it
it's free money so
so take the free money
um the
the shooter and the uh
so there's a school shooter again i
won't give his name or
the location don't like to give details
on these shooter stories
but
it turns out that we have a little more
detail and that the 50-year-old boy shot
his bully
seven or eight times
now he also shot a teacher
uh in the back and he grazed a teenage
girl before going on a run but the
person he primarily was focused on was
his bully
um somebody says he's 18.
um
well i'm reading the story right out of
the headlines he said
oh was it the 15 year old boy was the
one who punched him no
oh he shot a 15 year old boy thank you
thank you so the the person who was the
shooter was older
and the person he shot was a 15 year old
boy and
i guess the 50 year old had repeatedly
punched him
so
we of course do not celebrate any
violence
on livestream
uh youtube you listen to me google
talking to you
we do not celebrate or condone any kind
of violence
how many of you celebrated when bin
laden got killed
anybody
anybody did any of you feel happy
when bin laden got killed
oh well i can't be proud of it right
you're probably not proud of it
well i bet you did
when i heard that a bully got shot seven
or eight times
i was happy about it
i was happy about it
i would like to see more uh no i don't i
that would be promoting i'm not going to
promote violence
and i don't promote violence against
anybody including bin laden
but it is a fact that when i read this
story and i heard that a bully got shot
seven or eight times i didn't feel bad
for the bully
didn't feel bad
felt uh
felt a lot of sympathy for the shooter
felt like the shooter was more the
victim than the bully was
now this different story with whatever
happened with the teacher and whatever
the teenage girl obviously there needs
to be consequences for this
uh but if the i'm just saying
hypothetically if the only thing that
happened
is that the bully had been shot seven or
eight times and nobody else had been
injured
put me on that jury
you know what i'm saying
you you i would fight to be on that jury
because i'm gonna i'm gonna get him off
or at least i'll hang i'll hang the jury
for sure
there's no way
on this on this earth
i'm gonna put anybody in jail for
shooting their bully
i'm not you can and i'm glad that the
law doesn't allow it right the law needs
to you know it needs to be illegal
of course and you know and i don't
promote it i promote no violence
whatsoever
but when it happens
there's no way i'm going to convict that
guy for
killing no way
nope
i might thank him i shake his hand
but of course this that doesn't really
apply to this story because he broke
other laws and hurt other people and you
know there's there's no forgiving that
yes he's gonna have to pay for that
all right
um
lastly
many of you asked me about the
uh status of boo the cat who i've been
trying to get to eat solid food for
two weeks now
uh yesterday was the first time she ate
solid food so i had to take her off some
meds and that's going to be a problem
because
she has to go back on some antibiotics
at some point
but she was scarfing down her
treats yesterday and
was getting her energy and attitude back
and that looked good
however
there's a but to the story
um
which is that she has cancer
so her immediate problem was not the
cancer it was just discovered in the
context of treating an unrelated problem
so um the cat is on the roof
she's happy and doing well today
um we will not have her with us next
year
don't know how long lasts
don't know yet if there is any um
recourse you know chemo is an option but
if the cat has already weakened and
she's sort of in a weakened state from
an unrelated surgery
um probably chemo is not the option it
would be with a healthy cat an otherwise
healthy cat
so we may not have that option but we're
going to try for it
meaning that i will try to get her as
healthy as possible
i will
i'll get as much good advice from the
veterinarian as i can
and i will um
do what i can
so that's that
