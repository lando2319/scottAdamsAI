hey everybody
i thought i'd give a little special
evening periscope on one topic there's a
lot of confusion i noticed
on the topic of mail-in votes and i
thought
this might be a situation where my
special skill stack is exactly what you
need
now if you've been watching the news
you've seen uh
biden saying things about mail-in votes
you see the press saying things about
mail-in votes you see the president say
things
gets a little confusing doesn't it
so i thought i would describe the three
different kinds of mail-in votes
to dale dale the democrat
and uh i'm gonna use a technique
that i've refined over the years it's
called
cursing because there are some topics
and i don't know exactly why
but you can't really penetrate every
topic
without the right kind of foul language
so there will be foul language here are
you ready
i think you are well let me explain to
dale first of all dale can you come over
here
uh i'd like to introduce you to the
group hi
dale are you ready for this quick
explanation
of mail-in voting and what's good and
bad about it
present all right so dale just pay
attention
we'll go to the white board and it's
really quite simple they're essentially
for all practical purposes three types
of
situations you've got your absency
absentee voting
which has been around for a long time
and that's where you request a ballot
so they mail it right to your address to
the address you told them to mail it to
you're expecting it and that works
really well we have lots of history on
this
it's reliable it's been tested and
for this bit of mail-in voting both
republicans
and democrats call this good
there is no argument
about this part of the mail in voting
it's completely good dale
do you understand what i'm saying that
this part
there's no argument about you get that
right of course
i'm not some kind of an idiot all right
well so
stay with me then there are two
situations that are kind of related
they're both unsolicited where they send
you all the ballots
whether you wanted them or not so
everybody who's on their database
gets a ballot now there are about i
think five states that have some history
with us
and they've had some time to clean up
their database of addresses
so nobody gets one that goes to the
wrong address
you don't get you know a dead person
stuff that sort of thing they've cleaned
it up
they've also tested it a few years
that's important
and they have some history so if
something weird happened this year
you could look at and say wait a minute
we've got some history here
we can tell that there's something wrong
there we better look into it
so for these five states who have a
little bit of a history with it
and have cleaned up their database this
is good
it's good democrats think this is a good
idea
and republicans also think this is a
good idea
for just these five that have tested it
do you understand that dale
of course go go ahead
continue all right now here's where it
gets complicated dale
there's a different situation that is
not like these other two
and unfortunately most of the states
fall into this category that if they
were to send
massive unsolicited ballots out it would
be the first time they've done it
and their databases would be as bad as
these were
these were the other five when they
started
so we we have some history and we know
that it takes some time to get them
right
and a lot could go wrong but
they haven't tested it yet and they
don't have a history
so if these states got a got an output
let's say a result that the public
didn't quite
trust what would you compare it to
because we've never had a coronavirus
situation with
mass mail-in votes for the state or
these states
so dale now you understand the situation
here right
you've got two situations with mainland
votes
thumbs up democrats like them
republicans like them
independents experts the media
good and good you got that so far dale
you understand that right
i'm not an idiot i got it
okay but you also follow
that this is the minority there
there are not many votes relative to
this big big category here
this one that's not tested with bad
databases
and there are enough anecdotes of things
going wrong in these situations that
you have reason to worry so dale now do
you understand
why the president thinks that male in
voting of this type
which would be the dominant type would
be
not credible and maybe would you know
need some work do you understand that
deal
yes i do in other words mail-in voting
is perfectly safe
um i'm not sure what just happened here
it's possible that i
said something wrong or i explained it
wrong
but dale two of these situations are
good
but they're not very big if you add them
all together and the one that is big
is bad that's bad you get that right
you are just trying to gaslight me
because we've already proven
and everybody knows that mail-in votes
are completely
defendable completely reliable
there's no problem with them whatsoever
in fact
the country has been doing mail-in votes
and absentee votes for years
scott years okay
dale when you talk about the absentee
voting that we've been doing for years
we've been over this that's not what
we're talking about
so if you do me a favor can we agree on
this dale
since since nobody disagrees
about absentee votes being a good idea
nobody
nobody in the whole planet has a problem
with that
would it be okay just for convenience
if we never talk about it again just
just
act like it's not even part of the
decision since we all agree on it
would you would you agree dale yes
that's perfectly reasonable
so now do you see why mail-in voting is
a problem
scott mail in voting has been proven for
years
for years this worked
no no
it hasn't been tested in the most of the
states
the way they want to do it only the part
we can't
we don't want to talk about because
there's nothing to talk about
mail-in voting absentee it's reliable
stop gaslighting me um
dale there's only one other thing i'd
like to do
if you could step over here just just
just get a little bit closer
how about here yeah that's good
stay right there dale
oh oh no
stupid idiot how god damn
you stupid
idiot idiot jesus
how many times do you have to tell dale
which kind of mail-in vote it is
you idiot
and seen and now you understand
mail in voting glad i could help
have a nice night
