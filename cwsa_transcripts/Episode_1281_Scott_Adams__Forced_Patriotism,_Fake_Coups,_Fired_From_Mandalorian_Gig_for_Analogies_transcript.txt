hey
oh whoa everybody's here good to see you
well this is going to be oh you know it
it's
you already know it's going to be the
best coffee with scott adams why do i
even have to tell you
you know the routine yeah if it could be
any better than this
i don't think it's possible it really
isn't but
we're gonna try let's try to take it to
the next level with a simultaneous sip
and all you need is a couple of mugger
glasses tanker tells us to sign a
canteen joker flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing
that makes everything better except the
mandalorian
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
i feel the normality returning to the
country
wait no no it's gone again it's gone
again
we were almost normal there for a moment
but no
not at all let's talk about the news
you all saw the big news that two mess
are better than one
according to the cdc they did a little
test and they found out that
two masks will reduce the the
infectious particles by 92.5 percent
92.5 percent now what they were talking
about specifically
is that people wear a regular cloth
covering
like a bandana kind of thing
if you put a real mask beneath the
bandanna
the two of those things would give you
92.5
uh protection now
how do you interpret that how do you
interpret this information
i saw on twitter that somebody
interpreted the fact
that two masks block 92 percent
let's round it up to 93 if two masks
block 93 percent
of the infectious particles that means
that one mask doesn't work
is that how you read it would your
conclusion
from this fact be that math that one
mass
doesn't work if two masks block 93
of the infectious particles don't you
think one mask
blocks a little bit
and given that the second mask in this
example
was the least useful kind of
covering which would be just a cloth
covering like a bandana
given that we know that's the least
protective
wouldn't we be able to say without
actually doing a
randomized controlled trial would it be
reasonable to say
that the real mask might be doing some
work
maybe not 92.5 work
but isn't it doing something now
many of you know that the the amount of
the viral load makes a big difference in
outcomes so if you can reduce it by
let's say 50 percent
let's be conservative and say that the
first mask
only reduced it by 50 percent
to mass gets you to something bigger
would that be worth it would the would
the scientists be right
if they had been telling us to wear one
mask
and one mask would only reduce let's say
we don't know this is true
but i'm just working through a uh
a citizen trying to figure out what
science is trying to tell us
because there's science and then there's
citizens
and then there's this giant uh confusing
area between what science is really
saying
and what we're understanding right so
that whole
communicating science part is the real
problem area
science is great except that it's
described to us by people
so if you hear your science described
to you by a person
are you hearing science no
you're hearing just a person if you
don't if you didn't directly do the
science yourself
if you're not the one who performed the
experiments
you're not really hearing science you're
hearing somebody else describing science
so you're really hearing
a person so when you say do you trust
science i translate that in
my mind into would i trust a stranger
whose incentives i do not understand
never never if you're
ever in the situation where you're asked
to
trust a stranger when you don't know the
stranger's motivations or intentions
don't do that don't do that
so when we hear about the science we are
being told that we're hearing real
science but we're not we're just hearing
somebody's interpretation
so the best we can do as citizens since
we don't have access to science
we have access only to people talking
about it
is to use whatever a little bit of sense
and judgment we can to do the best we
can
because science is just not available to
us
in an everyday decision-making way you
just have to do without it
if we had it it'd be great
i don't i only have people talking about
it
so my common sense
judgment is that if the cdc studied this
carefully and found out that two masks
block 93 of your infectious particles
and we know that the amount of viral
load does matter
it does seem to be that they have come
close to proving
not technically in a real scientific
randomized controlled trial way
but pretty close to a common sense
clearly obvious benefit of masks
now if the cdc's the way they studied it
was all
done wrong then of course none of the
supplies
and we don't know if they did it right
do we
were you there were you in the
laboratory
did you did you watch them set up the
test and are you an
infectious uh disease specialist and a
mass
specialist and a scientist well if you
were all of those things
and you were there you maybe have a
pretty good idea of
what was happening but we weren't there
and of course we know the news is mostly
fake so we don't know anything
but i would say this is an indication
that one mask probably does something
useful
it is not proof there's not proof
but it's another good indication there's
some chatter on the internet because fox
news apparently cut off
the impeachment manager in mid-sentence
so he was talking about
you know he was showing how bad the
attack on the
capital was and fox news decided to go
to the five
and and and just you know have
entertainment instead
now what do you think of that
did fox news cut off news
was that news were we watching news
when the impeachment managers were
making a show
your specific video of the capital
assault so that we could really
feel the pain and the fear
of the members of congress
was that news was it news
about how the members of congress felt
about
the assault well i already knew it
didn't you was there anybody here who
was unaware
that the politicians and really
everybody who was at the capitol when
the assault happened is there anybody
who didn't know
given that people were literally being
killed
is there anybody who didn't know that
everybody there was afraid for their
lives
i feel like i knew that did any of you
not know that
did you not know that they were afraid
for their lives and there was an attack
and there was real violence did anybody
is there anybody in the country
who did not already know that so is it
news
the fact that somebody's making you feel
an attenuated
feeling about it is that news
well i guess it's news in the sense that
it's part of the story and
whatever any of the players of the
stories do i guess that's news
but once you've seen a little bit of it
and you say to yourself
scott now your name might be different
let's say your name isn't scott you
would
you would think it differently you would
fill in your name here
but scott
watching more of this footage is not
making me
smarter is not making me no
more facts it is not giving me reason or
detail
well it's giving me details that i don't
need
but what is it what is it conveying to
me
what is the purpose of the communication
that the impeachment
managers are making by showing more
details of the uh
of the assault well could it have any
reason
other than to make you emotionally
weakened is there any other reason
now i always i counsel you that if you
can't think of another reason for why
something's happening
that doesn't mean there isn't another
reason it just means you can't think of
one
so is this one of those cases where i
just can't think of a reason that they
need to show us this
extra video because remember the
the trump's own lawyers have stipulated
that what happened at the the capitol
was a horrible
event so you've got one side arguing
hey this was horrible you've got the
other side saying yeah it was
totally agree we will stipulate
stipulate being the
legal term that says we agree with what
you're saying
yes it was a horrible event people were
scared there was real danger
real violence so
if both sides agree
that those are the facts both sides
agree that anybody involved in anything
that was illegal
needs to be punished what exactly are we
looking at
and why are we looking at it the reason
is obvious is propaganda
is pure propaganda it's supposed to make
you feel a bad feeling
about a certain set of people in america
do you need that is that news
is it news when your politicians are
making it
number one all about themselves
that's right your congress decided that
the biggest
story in the whole country is
how they
feel how they feel
not it wasn't really a question about
the government being overthrown
anybody who thinks it was a real coup or
an insurrection in any serious way that
they would have controlled the
government and
changed the nature of the country or
anything like that that's just stupid
because nothing like that even remotely
like that happened they
were the most armed country in the world
and nobody used a gun except
the only person who used a gun was the
police officer who shot the
protester coming through the window
which i've called a good
not good in the sense that we don't wish
it happened but
correct law enforcement action in my
opinion
based on what we saw he probably stopped
some amount of more violence as tragic
as it was
so given that there's no information
being conveyed
which was is what i would call news is
fox news really to blame for cutting
away
i don't think so i think that cutting
away was
the right news decision because
otherwise they're just
exposing us to propaganda to make us
feel a certain way
and i don't really need the news to make
me feel
i like them to tell me the information
i'll figure out how to feel about it
but i don't need you to tell me how to
feel that's not news
so i'm going to back fox news on
pulling away from that
there's another story that doesn't make
any sense to me
except that we're in this weird world
where you could just say anything
and and the two sides would interpret it
to agree with themselves i mean i could
go in public and just say
[Applause]
and everybody who heard me the democrats
would say there he goes again
saying racist stuff and the republicans
would say
well i think he made perfect sense i
think he made sense
i don't know what you're talking about
so we're in a world in which you can say
anything just just any thing
and people will argue that you were
right
and others will argue that you're wrong
even if it doesn't make any sense
here's an example there's a headline
that says
donald trump knew that mike pence had
been evacuated from the maga mob
before he tweeted that the vp quote
didn't have courage to overturn the
election
meaning what meaning what
if you're a democrat you take that
statement to say
that trump didn't care that mike pence
was in danger
and endangered him further and
endangered him further
that's one interpretation here's the
other interpretation
that once trump heard that mike pence
had been evacuated
which means to safety right when you
evacuate somebody
do you evacuate them toward the danger
or do you evacuate them away from the
danger
because the president heard that his
vice president was not in danger
he had been evacuated and then after
that
he said something about his courage now
should he have said that
i don't think so that's my opinion i
think the president
was not handling it right i think i
think he needs to
you know answer to that but you know the
question
of whether he was encouraging an
insurrection or a coup is just
sort of stupid but the separate question
of whether he acted
in a way that reduced reduced the
risk of violence that's a separate
question and i don't think he acted in a
way that reduced
the chance of violence
so yeah what do you make of that story
it's a headline story and you could you
could
interpret it both ways we're just at a
point
in the world in which it doesn't matter
what the facts are we're just going to
interpret it the way we want
um the panda tribune whose you should be
following
if you're not following the panda
tribune
on twitter you should be because it's
funny and a good account
notice this the nbc news
said the following now just listen to
what nbc news
said and see if you can pick up anything
that's wrong with us
see if you can find out is there
anything in this
list that i'm about to read you is there
anything that doesn't
fit with the rest of the list
see if you can detect it because the
panda tribune did
see if you can here's what nbc says
in his first weeks in office president
biden has made a flurry of international
phone calls
to american allies including the leaders
of canada
britain france japan and china
which of those doesn't belong in the
list
of american allies
is it canada no we we have
we have our little dramas with canada
but i feel like they're allies
i feel like canada is a canada is a good
country
we like canadians even when we disagree
with them on issues
how about uh let's say look for britain
france well we argue with britain and
france now and then
but they're allies wouldn't you say
pretty good pretty good countries you
know we can have our differences but
we're solid allies with britain and
france
how about japan well world war ii was a
little tough but since then
since world war ii i'd say quite good
allies
quite good allies what's the other one
in this in this sentence uh
oh china china according to nbc
china which is killing 50 to 100 000
u.s citizens a year with fentanyl
intentionally the country that probably
lied to us about coronavirus
and is stealing our intellectual
property is giving us bad
trade deals and selling propaganda into
our
markets and is closed closed to our
investors in many ways
they're our ally apparently they're our
ally according to nbc news
now do you see how how this works
nbc news is allegedly uh
a vehicle of the cia
did you know that now i'm saying
allegedly
because people smarter than i am claim
that this is uh
obvious and known um
so you should you should look to the
other people to get a confirmation of
that i'll just say it's the allegation
the allegation is that nbc news is the
most
the most captured of our media
captured i mean by uh intelligent
services
because ultimately any any kind of media
that makes a difference is going to get
captured by intelligent services it's
just a matter of time
sooner or later your intelligence
services should
if they're doing their job i guess you
could say
if they're doing their job they should
eventually capture
all of the media services in their own
country and capture as many as they can
in other countries too
so the only question about
whether whether the intelligence
services
manage our news the question is timing
is it happening already or is it in our
future
but it's guaranteed there there's no
future in which it doesn't happen
there's a it might be a question of when
but of course it has to happen
the intelligence services will always
control the
media eventually and now you can see
something that looks exactly like
china controlling our controlling nbc
news
because would an american loyal to the
united states who was aware of the news
ever put china in a list of our allies
and just try to just slip it in there at
the end of the list
and if you didn't notice china it's sort
of like
our american allies including canada
britain france
japan and i don't know
just kind of slip it in there right
when you see it happening right in front
of your eyes you know the
the propaganda the you know maybe maybe
foreign influence
i mean it looks like it it looks like
foreign influence
but you can't know for sure
all right uh brett weinstein made the uh
made a funny comment about the double
mask
situation he says why not make masks
doubled in the first place
to which i say huh pretty good question
if a double mask works why wouldn't you
make the
single mask twice as thick
i don't know the answer to that question
i assume it has something to do with
you wouldn't be able to breathe i don't
know is that the reason
i really don't know um it's not like air
isn't going someplace
so anyway it's a funny question i don't
think he means it seriously but it's
or maybe he does i don't know but it's a
funny question but it removed
it reminded me of an old joke about you
know how when an airplane crashes
they'll they'll usually find the black
box and it'll be intact
the whole airplane will be destroyed but
the black box will just be intact and
then they'll figure out what happened
to which i say to myself this is an old
joke
why don't they make the whole airplane
out of that black box material
huh now it's just a joke obviously you
couldn't do that
but it reminded me of that uh
matt walsh has a very interesting
string of tweets about lebron james and
the use of the word karen so i guess
lebron tweeted that there was a
karen as lebron said in the audience and
he mocked her and
as matt walsh points out karen is a
racial slur
and he as matt points out if i use the
stereotypical name in a pejorative way
to refer to a black woman
everyone would agree it's a slur i would
agree
i would agree with that if he used a
stereotypical
pejorative you know a word to describe a
black woman i wouldn't be comfortable
with that
would you i would consider that very
offensive
to have some like special word that
that's like a
a bad word for a black woman are you
kidding me
that would be completely unacceptable
but apparently it's okay for a white
woman or at least some people think so
and matt walsh is
pushing back and he says that
using the karen word is no different
than other racial slurs and that lebron
is therefore a bigot
do you agree with that do you agree
and by the way there's if you research
karen
you'll see reference to it as
specifically a white woman
i know that other people have used it to
mean just a generic
thing so i would like to suggest the
following
standard so that we just treat things
the same
as i as as i've often said
that i am in complete agreement that any
group can
ban certain words about their own group
when i say ban i mean they get to say
what is offensive to them and
if it's offensive to them that should
mean something to us
why do you want to offend anybody what
would be the purpose
you know what what would you gain by
just offending people
nothing so why you know why
why wouldn't we as just a polite society
that's trying to get along
why wouldn't we allow people to say hey
this is a bad name for the people in my
group
use any other name but just don't use
this one
right this is just the bad one it's why
of course the n word is
universally banned does anybody disagree
with that
i hope not i feel like that's a really
ugly ugly
super ugly word has no place has no
place in polite society
but i would argue that the karen word
although it does not have that kind of
historical
weight or significance as the n word
nowhere near it i think that
if white women
wanted it banned i would back them on
that
now if i were to use the that
word karen at least i would be a white
person
saying something that sounds like bad
toward white people so i think that
would be allowed
except except i'm male
so if i said somebody's a karen i would
be sexist
but not racist if you're lebron
and you say somebody's a karen you're
sexist
and you're racist so i'm
only sexist because i'm white lebron is
sexist
and racist if he uses the karen word
so i guess we'll have to figure out how
much we care about that
not very much as it turns out the k word
yeah
so one of the biggest stories on the
internet is that uh
actress gina carrano i hope i'm
pronouncing it right who is a former mma
fighter and
uh until recently she just got fired
from her job
but she was one of the stars of the
disney plus
series the mandalorian which is based in
a star wars universe and it's a
the main character is this masked
helmeted
you know fighter mandalorian he's called
and uh gina was one of the other stars
and she played a
badass you know uh just a badass
mercenary i guess and she got fired for
saying some things that would be
somewhat typical of a republican to say
on twitter
right so basically you could pick any
standard republican who uses twitter
and say all right what did you say
standard republican
and that's kind of what she has said in
the past standard republican stuff
and there was a call for her to be fired
for it
and the biggest complaint
they had is that she made a holocaust
or nazi reference to the fact that
republicans are being
uh you know identified and discriminated
against
now what happened to her when she said
that republicans are being treated like
the holocaust like the jews were in the
holocaust
at the moment the the
the public ganged up on her and got her
fired
so did she prove her point
yes she did yes her point was that
having
conservative oriented views
would put you in a discriminated
situation
and then she was proven right by being
fired
for having those very same views which
her point was
if you have these views you could get
fired or discriminated against
right so she proved her point the
uh the funniest part of this story is
that
the left is saying that she basically
minimized the holocaust because the
holocaust
was about literally exterminating and
killing six million jews
how could you compare that to some
people losing their job in the united
states
right different you know one is gigantic
the other one's pretty bad but they're
not
you know these don't weigh the same
right is that point good
no that's not a good point it's true
it's true that they don't have the same
weight that's true
nobody's going to argue that but the way
nazi analogies are used in this country
is as an analogy to
[Music]
you know make some hyperbole to make
your point
when the republicans had been called uh
nazis
from 2015 to 2021
did anybody who was calling trump a nazi
think that he was really going to
exterminate 6 million people no
no it doesn't work that way they used it
with
hyperbole they used it exactly the same
way she did
and she backed up she backed it up right
when she said that
a certain class of people would be
treated harshly
that would that being the whole point
and then she was treated harshly
for being one of those people her point
completely proven
by by the fact that she got fired
um that said of course we don't want to
minimize the holocaust and that's one of
the complaints i've had
from the beginning when trump's
supporters were being called nazis etc
is that it minimized
the real thing um so either
pick a standard and i think it's
hilarious that the left doesn't
understand that they've been doing that
to the right
for decades now so
um and then somebody complained on
twitter somebody on the left complained
that every time one of these uh
right-leaning characters
gets uh cancelled that they end up
making more money
to which i tweeted i hope so
that that would be my goal my goal is
that everybody who gets cancelled
for let's say ordinary speech
it would be one thing to get canceled
for actually using the n-word
and you know actually saying racist
stuff or
actually inciting violence yeah i mean
if you get canceled for that stuff
that's your own damn fault
but if you get cancelled for what is
absolutely routine
even if you disagree with it it's
routine language
yeah i think i'd like to see those
people get rich so i would like to see
[Applause]
what's her name gina carrano actress and
ex-mma fighter do well
so if anybody wants to make her a job
offer or something
go ahead let's make her rich in a new
segment that i'm going to call
eating their own eating their own
this is what the left is doing to
themselves now that
their common enemy trump is is at least
mostly off the stage so these are the
examples in just today's news
just today so the ap has an article in
which it looks like they've turned on
the lincoln project
remember the lincoln project were the
alleged republicans who had
turned on trumpism and you you basically
joined the left in attacking trump
now the ap is basically accusing that of
being sort of a grifter
scam i'm using my own words to
characterize
their story but the essence of it is
they collected 90 million dollars
and set up a structure where you
couldn't exactly tell where it went
meaning that out of that 90 million
dollars
some amount of that went to the people
who organized
the lincoln project for all of their
good work
organizing the lincoln project how much
of the 90 million
do you suppose went to the organizing
members
we don't know the only thing that the ap
reports is that maybe a third of it was
used on ads
a third and of 90 million only 30
million was used on
the thing which the group was trying to
do the rest of it was
consulting now i suppose they were
trying to consult as well
but how much of that went to the
consultants
what was the word that rick wilson used
the most when talking about
trump grifter
a grifter somebody's making making money
off a situation
somewhat disingenuously
i don't know uh but the ap which you
would associate with the left or at
least if you're in the right you would
say they are associated with the left
uh have turned on the on the lincoln
project
so that's story number one number two
uh instagram has banned robert f kennedy
instagram just banned
robert f kennedy and why do they do it
because he repeatedly they say
shared false claims about coven 19
and he apparently used an anti-vaxxer
and he was banned for quote repeatedly
sharing debunked claims about the
coronavirus vaccines
so he's a member of the left this
happens to be one of the areas in which
some members of the left and some
members of the right
agree now i'm not on that team
i i suspect the vaccinations are
probably more good than bad
but it's interesting that a member of
the left
just got banned on instagram now
remember
there's no trump so if they need to
create action and
controversy and all this
they're gonna end up acting against
themselves so that's
example two number three
jeep the the company that makes jeep
they pulled bruce springsteen's super
bowl ad
after it was revealed he was arrested
for a dwi
and reckless driving in november on
jersey shore
so bruce springsteen associated with the
left
has been pulled from his commercial now
that they found out he had some
dwi however the dwi
appears to be fake news which makes it
even better
so he got he got pulled off uh
his commercial got pulled probably
for fake news now the part that's real
is he was arrested
for a dwi the part that might not be
real
is that he was drunk because even the
apparently the breathalyzer actually
showed he wasn't
not even close he did have a shot
so i guess a police officer he pulled
over in his motorcycle to take some
pictures with some fans
somebody offered him a shot he took it a
police officer saw it they pulled him
over
they tested him and his alcohol level
was way below
the the drunk level so he didn't do
anything
illegal except i don't know
took a shot in front of a cop i guess
while he before he got on his motorcycle
so it's probably fake news and he's
going to get
semi-cancelled for that that's example
number three
number four i told you the story about
uh
how uh mark cuban owner of the dallas
mavericks
had cleverly decided just to not play
the national anthem
and just get rid of the whole problem
just don't play the national anthem
well the nba having once it was
discovered that they'd gone
uh over a dozen games without playing it
somebody said hey
where was that national anthem which is
hilarious that it took
12 games to figure it out i have a
feeling mark cuban is laughing about
that
that it took 12 games before anybody
even noticed it's like this big issue
it's such a big issue that they played
12
games nobody even noticed
and yet we act like it's a big issue
didn't even notice
when it wasn't happening but here's the
the fun part of this story the nba
decided that they would force
the mavericks to play the national
anthem and indeed they did i get i think
it was last night against the hawks
uh so mark you've been relented
and decided to go with the nba now
here's my take on this i like patriotism
i think it's a necessary glue to hold
society
together i think it's more good than bad
you know you can imagine it
turns into jingoism and you know
whatever
but i think patriotism is far more good
than bad
and i'm in favor of brainwashing our
children to make them
patriots because it keeps the country
together
but what about forced patriotism
because it seems to me that mark cuban
was sort of forced to play the national
anthem
do you know what i feel like when you
show me the flag and say would you like
to stand and
show respect for the flag i feel proud
i feel good about it like i feel
everything about that just feels good to
me
i like our flag i really like our
country
you know even if i complain about it i
really like it
so patriotism 100
um all on board with patriotism
but what about forced patriotism
let me tell you what i think about
forced patriotism
 you the moment
is forced you
you're not going to force me to do it
that's for sure
if i want to do it i'd love to
but if you're going to force me you
we don't work that way the country it
doesn't work that way now i know what
you're going to say
it's the nba is a private organization
they can have their own rules just like
a
platform could have terms of service and
they're just enforcing their own
internal
rules why is that my issue to which i
say it's not really
if internally they want to do this it's
good for their business that's fine
but there's this other part of the story
where apparently the texas governor
threatened the dallas mavericks that
they would pull their tax benefits
they got some kind of tax benefits that
they would pull their tax benefits
if they didn't play the national anthem
now i've got a big problem
it's one thing when your private
organization says
hey our organization would do better if
we play this national anthem
fine that's fine private organization
mark cuban can be in the organization or
he can sell his team
you know it's that's okay but the
governor of texas is the government
he's the government and the government
just twisted the mavericks arm now we
don't know if mark cuban
cared about what the governor was saying
you know we don't have any information
that says
that mark cuban made a decision based on
what the government sent
but they did put pressure on real
pressure
like real money pressure
that is is unacceptable as anything
could ever be
so let me say this to the governor of
texas
 you you for trying to make
the nba play the national
anthem if the nba wants to play the
national anthem
great great but if the government
any form of government is pressuring
them to play the national anthem
 you you hard
that's that's over the line that's way
over the line
that is way way way over the line
right that doesn't work in this country
now i'd like to think that
mark cuban's decision was based on the
nba's preference
not on the government's preference but
if it was
if any part of this decision was because
of the government's influence
you should lose your job for that the
governor of texas should lose his job
for this
he should be impeached in fact i think
that's an impeachable offense
to try to force somebody to be patriotic
and to show it in a specific way i think
that's
impeachable or should be i doubt it is
but
um that
is my show for today
um yeah it's like forcing religion it's
exactly like that
not exactly like that but you know you
know the point
all right is there anything i forgot
today
uh somebody says no that's my governor
and my tax dollars
government tax dollars texans tax
dollars so you're saying that
the governor was just representing the
people of texas
and so it was the people of texas who
would
like the mavericks to play it
well i see what you're saying i see what
you're saying that the governor was
representing the will of the people that
doesn't make any difference
you get that that doesn't make any
difference right if the
if the people were directly in charge i
might be
persuaded but they elected the
government and the government can't do
that
at least i think it should be
impeachable if they do it it doesn't
matter if the people want it
that is completely irrelevant suppose
the people wanted the government to
suppress your freedom of speech
is that okay a bunch of people want it
yeah we really want our government to
suppress
freedom of speech so then it's okay
because the people want it
no no it's not okay the government can't
do those things
there are things that the people can do
the things that individual
private companies can do but there are
things that your government
just can't do if
if you're doing it right
uh why does capitalism need tax money
it's a it's a fair question you know why
do why does
uh your local community support athletic
teams
and i would say that at least part of
that is the national
anthem weirdly
part of the reason that a government
would put tax money toward a sport
which you could say well it's just
entertainment why is my
government spending my money on somebody
else's entertainment
if you don't watch sports and i think
the reason is that
uh sports are a big unifying
element of society and because you do
the
pledge of allegiance it actually creates
more patriots
gives you something to fight about
that's symbolic instead of real fighting
and i do think that having a sports
identity is a real part of a brand for a
city
i do think that the intangibles are
pretty big
now how do you measure the intangible
benefits
compared to the tax dollars which you
can measure more easily
well it's a judgment call it's a
judgment call you can't
know how much benefit you'll get because
it's all these weird
patriotisms better community has a
better brand the city has more of a
reputation
none of that you can put a dollar amount
on but it's not
irrational for the city to want to get
those benefits
somebody says because it generates tax
revenue yeah so some of it comes back
that's correct i don't believe that
governments see it as a
profit investment i think it's still a
loss
but it's nonetheless true that some of
the money comes back in different ways
sports are modern versions of roman's
bread and circuses
i think that's true anything that gets
the public entertained
and diverted is probably good
for society because all that energy
needs to go somewhere it basically
siphons off a lot of aggression in a way
now i don't know if there's any science
to suggest that's a good thing
but it looks like that's what's
happening anyway
um scott yearly subscription options on
locals anytime soon i haven't heard
anything about that
maybe that will be an option but we are
looking into changing the
uh the fee structure so you could follow
more people at a reasonable fee
uh andrea mitchell has egg on her face i
don't know what that story is is that
something breaking
breaking news
um all right so that's all i got for
today
and i will talk to you oh yeah one one
other piece of news
saw a press release from fox news saying
that the greg
guffield show which you're used to
watching on saturday nights
is going to be every night or five
nights a week i think
so greg guffeld great job
not only uh and i assume he's still
doing going to do the five at the same
time
so he will have probably two of the
biggest shows on
on fox now why does greg gutfeld
succeed where others in his business
have
not well one reason is he's not
committed to
you know being crazy about one team he's
willing to
say this team did this good this team
did this well
so he is more uh certainly
as far away as you can get from the
let's say the hannity side of the world
and a lot closer to the hey let's look
at the facts
and try to figure out what makes sense
and what doesn't make sense part of the
world
and that apparently is working so
congratulations to him on that
all right um
and that's all i got for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope is down uh google
fallon fox why should i do that
about transgender athletes and women's
sports now when i talk about the
transgenders
everybody hears it wrong so
everybody who thinks they disagree with
me on transgender sports
they probably don't because they don't
quite understand what i'm saying it's
like you can say a
and people hear b and then they just
want to talk to me about why i'm wrong
about b
i never said b i only said a
what i mean by that is that if you
reorganize sports
so it doesn't just have a women's group
and a men's group
then everybody can just play with the
level of talent that
that is appropriate and men and women
would be matched on teams normally it
wouldn't just be transgender
and then you'd have the same amount of
winners and losers
but it would be distributed differently
if your issue is a few college athletes
let's say women who would not get
scholarships
why do you care there are there's so few
scholarships
and it only goes to people who were born
genetically gifted and also were lucky
enough
to have a parental situation that could
support their sport
why should they get any awards what
why do they get a scholarship why does
that even make sense
so if some women don't get scholarships
do you care
why do schools even do sports i'm not
even sure it's useful
so um the fact that
let me put it another way no matter how
many women
or men get trophies for sports
i won't get any how many did you get
how many trophies did you get probably
none
i mean recently maybe you got some in
high school but how many trophies did
you get this year
did you get any i didn't get any
this whole trophy thing affects this
tiny tiny
tiny little group of people it's not you
it's not me and why are we even caring
about it
just reorganize the sports so everybody
can play at the level that they play at
forget about these stupid scholarships
if colleges want to give them well who
cares
i mean they're private if they're
private universities they want to give a
scholarship
they can do it for any any reason they
want
and i i don't see any reason why uh you
need to have
sports winners who get the trophy and
get the scholarship
it just society doesn't need that it has
no value at all
so my point is not that if you kept
sports exactly as they are
transgender athletes wouldn't uh distort
things in a way that people don't like
well that's clearly true it's clearly
true that the transgender athlete
in some situations would dominate you
know women's sports
that's just true but how much you care
about it is the crazy part
it can be true and not important
but uh i don't i don't support keeping
sports exactly the way they are
i think that they should change to
simply let people play with the level of
talent
that is equal to their skill that's it
forget about the old gender thing
entirely all right um
and that's all i got for now i'll talk
to you
