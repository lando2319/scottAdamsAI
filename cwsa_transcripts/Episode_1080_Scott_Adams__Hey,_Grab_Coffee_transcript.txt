hey everybody
come on in hope you had a great weekend
it's time
for the cake off to the week the thing
that's gonna make this
just an incredible week one of the best
one of the best and all you need
does anybody know what you need to get
this kicked off
i think you do all you need is
a copper mug or a glass a tanker chalice
or steiner canteen sugar flask of vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite coffee or
beverage
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes is everything better
it's called the simultaneous step but
it's happening now go
ah that was especially good
all right for those of you who have been
following me for
a long time i have an update now
for something that you you've been
tracking literally for years
some of you and it is just the freakiest
thing
you know my life is weird in general
all right when when you start getting a
little bit famous everything
becomes weird but on top of that
i have this whole other layer of
weirdness
which is this category that i would call
things that go my way that really
shouldn't
in other words uh my my statistical
sense
of what is possible and what is not is
completely broken
and let me give you an example and some
of you know the story
so uh years ago i had a neurological
condition called the spasmodic dysphonia
which rendered me unable to speak
so that if i tried to speak it would
sound like
and would chop off all the words and
people couldn't understand it in
conversation
i couldn't use the telephone for three
years basically
so it's about three and a half years of
having that problem where i couldn't
speak
and during that time whenever i drove my
car by myself
i did affirmations now affirmations is
when you just
repeat or write down in this case while
i'm driving i just repeated it down loud
some objective some
future you that you wanted that was
preferred
over what where you already were and i
picked
the most ridiculous affirmation
i mean i picked a ridiculous affirmation
and it was this
that while i had an incurable at the
time
it seemed incurable and it didn't look
like it was going to change anytime soon
an incurable voice problem and my
affirmation which i would
struggle to get out you know while i
drove
was that i scott adams will have a
perfect voice
now what is crazy about that is not just
that i had an incurable voice problem
right i mean the key word is incurable
there was nothing you could do about it
nothing um
i mean you could do botox shots in your
neck but that doesn't give you a good
voice you sound like you're on
helium but the second part of this
impossibility is that i never had a good
voice before i had that problem
i had a very nasally kind of kind of
constricting
sort of nasally voice at best i i'm
doing a bad impression of my own voice
but as you know recently i just this
week i had surgery on my
sinus area and i cleared out some polyps
and i was listening to myself
i was recording something just this
morning for the
locals subscribers and i recorded it
and i played it back and i listened to
it and i thought
i think i have a perfect voice
i and it's blowing my freaking mind
because this wasn't possible
it's not possible that at age 63
i would have the best voice of my life
not even close
i mean i'm talking about levels above
the best voice i ever had at
age 25 not even close and
if you told me that any of this was
possible in the in the real world
i just i really could not have
wrapped my head around this but the
this isn't even the big part of the
story the big part of the story is
my sense of what is possible is just
completely broken
and it has been for you know decades
really because when dilbert first took
off
i mean the the uh the odds of dilbert
succeeding
you probably know or one in uh 20
000 or something the odds of me writing
a book without having any
you know prior experience as a writer
and having it a number one
bestselling book what were the odds of
that really
i mean i was really really in love with
that
and you know i just got married to the
most beautiful woman in the entire
metaverse
and none of it seems possible
but here's here let me extend this now
into the news so it's
more about you and less about me
have any of you noticed that the things
i
i tend to be persuading toward
always seem to happen even weird things
and today is a good day to talk about
that how many of you remember
it was probably in
2018 that i started saying
almost you know on a regular basis that
we should decouple from china
now take take yourself back two years
and imagine that you heard this
cartoonist saying we should decouple
from china
what did you think about that didn't you
think that was just the craziest thing
if you could pick one thing that wasn't
going to happen
it would be decoupled from china i mean
that would be right at the top of
anybody's list of things that just
couldn't happen
and now we're doing it
what was the first the first person you
heard
uh tweet or say
that tick doc this enormous platform
that's
one of the most if not the most popular
thing among kids in the united states
and i said it should be banned in the
united states
did you think that was possible really
did you think it was possible that tick
tock
would be banned when you first heard it
i mean after a while maybe it started
sounding a little bit feasible
and then when the president started
talking about it you were like yeah
probably probably so but that didn't
look
possible to you did it if you're honest
with yourself that probably didn't look
possible
and i have to admit that
in the beginning it looked impossible to
me
but i've had so many experiences where
things that looked impossible
eventually fell if i just kept pushing
on him long enough
in the case of my voice
63 years it took me
63 years of pushing on the same rock
to get it to the top of the hill but
damn it i don't give up
i've told you this story before my um i
have a
let's say an operating system within my
brain
that's always running regardless of what
apps are running there's always also
an operating system below that and the
operating system
you all get to program yourself to some
extent
some of you are born with but you can
reprogram yourself
you know through persuasion and
experience and education
etc and one of the things that i've
programmed
myself for and i've told you this is
prisoner island
and it's a story that's not a real story
but i hold it in my head as my operating
system
and it goes like this you for some of
you heard this that
if i were let's say convicted for some
crime and i were taken to the
island of prisoners where there's no law
you know it's just the prisoners rule on
this island and they can't get off
and you drop me on the island on day one
they beat me
nearly to death on day two they beat me
up again
nearly to death day three day four first
several months
it's looking bad for scott beaten up you
know
almost to death every single day
but if you come back in a year maybe
three
i'll be running the island and everybody
who touched me
will be dead and that's that's how
that's my operating system so when i see
a problem like an
incurable voice problem i don't say to
myself
well it looks like the prisoners beat me
up i guess i'm done
i wake up the next day and the prisoners
beat me up again and the next day they
beat me up again
and every day the operating system is
running
it's like i'm gonna get you i am going
to get you
enjoy today because it's coming back
i am going to get you and today
is just a special day for me because
i chased this thing 63 freaking years
and never once did i give up not even
once
not once did i think i don't you know
that i really can't do it i mean i i
certainly had a
conscious understanding of what's you
know possible and
statistically likely in the real world
but i never gave up
and that's because of the operating
system and i think
that some of that might be just born
with it i don't know
but i've certainly spent a lot of time
trying to enhance it
so maybe if you have a little bit of
something that you're born with you can
you can beef it up a little bit but i
would suggest
that you find your own operating systems
that work for you
sort of a story and it's good to put it
in a story
because stories are so powerful that's
um
you can actually program your brain with
stories
that's why they're so powerful anecdotes
are so powerful in the news
you don't want the george floyd story to
dominate your understanding of a big
complicated situation because it's just
one situation
tragic as it was but it does
because because stories are what program
your brain
so you can put your own story in there
and and the beauty is you can just make
it up
you know prisoner island is completely
made up
but because i see it so clearly i've
i've held it in my
operating system for all my entire life
that it's this is real to me as if i
if i had experienced it you know at
least mentally
so the president's looking at banning
tick tock which
looks like what that might be is that
microsoft would acquire it
very interesting which i think is also a
a fairly brilliant uh workaround
so that the kids still get their their
tick tock
and it probably would be an election
problem if tick tock got killed
before election day because there's so
many kids who'd be mad and complaining
to their parents about trump
it might actually make a difference so
it's good that microsoft
is looking at at least taking that over
and i think
facebook's wechat is also on the table
maybe for banning and when you think
about the fact
that uh facebook is banned
in china you know i don't know if i'd
ever really paid much attention to this
this area but the fact that china bans
facebook but we had not banned their
version of facebook
what's up with that to to use the
president's phrase
what's up with that that's obviously
something that had to be fixed
you know either either china needs to
loosen up on facebook
or wechat's just gotta go you you can't
live in a world
where a country will ban your stuff and
you're not banning their stuff
you can't live in that world that's just
not a well-balanced world
it's got to be both or none so wechat's
wechat has to go
there's just no i would say that's not
on the table for
serious discussion that has to go
that's a that's a no-brainer you know it
might be difficult but it has to go
it really does
so msnbc pundit can i call him that
ali velshi he might not call himself a
pundit so i won't label him i'll just
say
he's a msnbc person a host
would you call him a host of a show i'm
not sure if he has a show where he's a
regular guest but anyway he says in a
tweet
imagine being president and knowing that
discussions are actively underway
about whether it's going to fall to the
marines or the secret service agents
who surround you to remove you from
office
if you refuse to leave after losing the
election
it's hard to believe that a serious
public figure
would send this tweet i suppose we're in
a world where nothing is
nothing is off the table but
i tweeted back that this sounds like a
mental health problem
no not specifically about ali velshi
but he's talking about other people
talking about it
whoever is talking about president trump
not leaving office willingly doesn't
understand
anything that is such a basic
misunderstanding of the world we live in
um now now certainly there's
there's a question of let's say the
election is genuinely just messed up
so i can imagine the scenario in which
the election is just
unambiguously it's just messed up
and nobody even doubts it you know the
the left is sure
it was rigged the right issue where it
was rigged foreign countries are sure it
was rigged
so there is a scenario in which the
election just doesn't work
so yeah i can imagine some scenario
where the president would have to
i don't know stay on for six months
until we have another election see if we
can do it right
i don't know what that would look like
but even that would be temporary
there's no scenario where the
president's gonna just try to stay
you know and install ivanka as his you
know
his heir or don jr or something that's
not going to happen
let me tell you why that's not going to
happen because there's this thing called
conservatives
have you heard of them have you heard of
conservatives
they like this thing called the
constitution
and the constitution's pretty pretty
clear about this election business
and if you think that that conservatives
you know as a they're crazy people
everywhere but
as a whole if you think conservatives
would be okay
with the president and even their own
president
losing an election and staying in office
i don't think you understand what a
conservative is
yeah that's that's the opposite
of his party now of course they'd be sad
they might you know put up an argument
for
why he should stay there but i'll tell
you what's not going to happen
what's not going to happen is somebody
having to militarily
remove the president from the white
house there's no
there's no adult scenario in which that
can happen
anyway so that does feel to me and i
mean this
literally that anyone who is thinking
seriously along those lines may have a
mental health
issue that they need to deal with and
let me expand that point
expand that point um
we we're dealing with uh antifa like
it's a
semi-political movement i don't know if
anarchists are considered political
i guess in their own way or
anti-political
you've got the black lives matter
movement
etc and i would
i would argue this that especially among
the violent
protesters you know you've seen a lot of
pictures of the mug shots of the ones
that are causing the trouble
not the not the peaceful people because
there are
lots of protesters who just really want
a better world
they genuinely do and so and they should
be respected for their freedom of speech
as well as their intentions
but when you see the people who got
caught
is it my imagination that they all look
like they have mental illness
i don't think it's drugs i mean there
might be some drugs too
but it looks like that we're we're
treating a mental illness problem
as some kind of a political movement
antifa
is about 80 mental illness in my opinion
now black lives matter is not black
lives matter
in my opinion shows not even a trace
of mental illness would you agree
you know you could say their priorities
are different or you know what they want
is reasonable or unreasonable those are
all fair questions
but i've never seen anything come out of
black lives matter
from an actual black citizen of this
united states
that looked even slightly crazy right
it just seems like different priorities
different understanding
maybe than you have about whatever what
needs to be done but none of it looks
crazy
it looks completely reasonable for their
point of view
antifa doesn't register that way to me
because first of all what the hell is
anarchy
what what is anarchy exactly
if you were to sit down and i don't
recommend it
but if you were to sit down with one of
the the antifa
um let's say a leader or even a member
and say all right all right i get why
you're i get what you're trying to do
but can you describe how that works out
for you
in the long run describe your life
after you get what you want what's it
look like
because i think the government is gone
right that's the whole point
of anarchy and i think law and order are
gone
which means the food supply is gone
which means the anarchist dies so
the the anarchists and antifa
in my opinion are have mental illness
and they are suicidal but they're not
very brave
or or they're not brave enough or they
don't have whatever it takes
to i i'm not let me withdraw brave
because i don't want anybody listening
to this to think that this would be
brave
to end their own life that's that's not
the message i'm trying to tell
i'm saying that the anti-fog people look
like they want to end
themselves but the way they're doing it
is by
playing out like they're ending the
united states there's nothing on the end
of that
process that they would want you know
they're now saying
when we get this it'll be a good world
it it really is just let's break
everything
and maybe i'll get killed in the process
it looks like that to me
so i think maybe it would help us to
imagine the anti-far as more of a mental
health issue
mixed in with some domestic terrorists
and some people have actual
plans for power i suppose
what do you think of the hollowjoe
as i call him hashtag hollowjoe what do
you think about him debating
and i tweeted yesterday that i think
democrats
are slowly waking up to this realization
that there are two things that biden
could do debate wise
he could actually have a debate in which
case
i think most people think that would be
the end right because
biden seems pretty good when he stays on
script
and he has friendly people asking him
easy questions and he's got his note
his notepad but what happens
if you put him in a debate with trump
and trump throws him off the path
and how long would that take it would
take one second
for trump to push him off his game
because his game is very narrow now like
he can only talk about the things he's
sort of ready for and
prepared for if you give him anything he
didn't prepare for
it's going to be a disaster and trump is
just going to show up on stage and give
him
nothing but things he didn't prepare for
it's going to be the most unpredictable
situation in the world
so if you're biden's advisors and
backers
do you want to see hollow joe with his
very narrow game that's narrowing every
day
get on stage with the the person in the
world who has the biggest game
probably the biggest game we've ever
seen with the most
variety the most provocation
the most maddening you know
just just everything the most energy
that anybody has ever brought to this
job
is trump is literally the worst
matchup i could even imagine for biden
biden actually could do well
against the standard republican you know
you just put a boring republican up
there
and and have him talk and the boring
republican says
predictable things joe is ready because
it's predictable things
might look okay you know the audience
might not know there's anything wrong
with it
but you put trump up there and the first
thing he's going to do is throw him off
his game make him
angry get him flustered brain shuts down
it's
it's not gonna be pretty but what if he
doesn't
suppose uh joe biden doesn't debate
what happens then well then he loses the
other way
because if you don't debate i think
that's
that's essentially meaning you can't do
the job
right if you don't debate and you're
running for president
you have admitted that you can't do the
job of president i don't think
there's any way around that and it's
hilarious to watch
joe lockhart who used to be the
spokesperson for
was it bush and
he's writing opinion pieces on
probably cnn i think and his opinion was
that joe biden
should not debate but here's the reason
oh not because joe biden is incapable of
debating
but rather because president trump lies
so much
why would you give attention to a liar
and i'm thinking to myself
well that's trying a little too hard joe
it sounds like it's like it sounds like
uh you know the democrats were just
desperate for some kind of a narrative
where it makes sense that
the biden doesn't debate because if he
just doesn't do it that's really the end
of his
that's the end of his chances but if he
if he could find some
bs kind of reason why he wouldn't do it
that has nothing to do with
not being good at it and that's what
lockhart was trying to present
if that was their best play was that
their best play what lockhart said that
why would you debate somebody who
doesn't pass the fact checking
and i'm thinking that's sort of exactly
who you want to debate
if i told you hey you're going to go
into a debate
and your opponent is known for not
passing the fact-checking
do you say i'm bringing the facts
or do you say oh i can't deal with that
i'd better quit
i don't want to debate somebody who says
things that aren't true
and can be proven to be not true and the
next day the news will
only cover all the lies that he told i
don't want that
of course you want that that's exactly
the person you want to debate
so that was the most transparently
ridiculous excuse for getting a weak
candidate out of a debate but it's it
was kind of funny because it was so weak
here's my prediction i believe that the
polls will
tighten before the election day and not
because of anything the candidates are
doing
so that's my prediction the polls will
the polls will narrow
right before election day maybe sooner
but it won't have much to do with what
the candidates are actually doing
it'll have more to do with the fact that
the polls were rigged in the first place
and i it looks like it's just a repeated
2016
where the the primary polls are showing
a gigantic gap
and that's the message they want to send
apparently
so but they also still want to be in
business as legitimate pollsters
so they're going to have to get rid of
the rigging toward election day
so that it looks like well we only
missed it by two percent that's not bad
right something like that so that's the
prediction
um i saw that there were at least two
polls that seemed like they're already
turning in the president's favor
but they were the lesser known polls and
i'm not gonna
i'm not gonna mention them i'll just say
that there are at least two polls
just in the last 24 hours that would
indicate
a dramatic shift toward trump
but it could be just a difference in the
way they measure it
because the the question of whether or
not there are so-called
shy trump supporters out there is now
getting
ridiculously obvious that there
are now in 2016
you could be forgiven if you were a
democrat and you did not believe there
was such a thing as
a shy trump supporter but
now that you saw trump win you know
unexpectedly
is it only because the polls were not
exactly
as precise as they could have been
especially in the midwest is that the
only reason we were surprised
or were there some hidden trump
supporters
so here are the conditions to create
a massive amount of trump hidden
supporters
that the polls are not catching at the
moment the first condition
is that everybody has to ask that model
in their head
in other words if you're a trump
supporter you have to have it in your
head
that there's an option the option is to
be a
hidden trump supporter so just saying
something's an option and talking about
it makes it more likely to happen
it's just the way we're wired we're we
are mimics
and if anybody is doing anything it will
cause probably
more people to do that thing just
because we we imitate
so you should expect that all things
being equal
there would be more shy supporters this
time just because
2016 proved it's a thing
and if it's a thing it's an option and
if it's an option
and it's in the front of your mind when
the pollster calls
it's a little more likely that you'll
say oh a lot of people are doing this
i think i too will be a little cagey
when i answer the poll questions
so then add to that uh
three and a half or more years of
the uh the supporters of the president
being beaten up on camera
how many videos do you have of a of a
mega
hat wearing person being slapped around
and abused on camera
you've seen it a lot now maybe the left
has not seen it
but that's not relevant to this question
because the shy trump supporters
have all seen it all right everybody
who's a trump supporter has seen
plenty of video if they're on social
media plenty of video
of trump supporters getting abused and
physically
does that make you and we all know the
stories of people being fired
fired from the wall street journal or
acquitting in that case
um and we've seen how much
social oppression there is so if there
are not
it if if it turns out i don't know if
we'll ever be able to
measure it but if it turned out in the
future that we learned that there were
no such thing
as shy trump supporters for this
election
or that it was minimal i would be amazed
because every condition to create
a lot of them is in place and strongly
in place
and has been in place for a while it's
it's dangerous to your career
it's dangerous to your health you know
it's a thing
you know you can easily do it by lying
to the pollsters
it's a thing trust me it's a thing
and i believe that the folks supporting
biden
are slowly worrying
that it's a thing i don't know that
they're convinced they still might
believe the polls
but you know they're worrying about it
it's
it's starting to get in their head and
i'll bet you'll see a lot more about
this
from you know from people trying to deny
it or whatever
but it's definitely in their head and
they also know that
biden can't survive either the debate
or the skipping of the debate so they
have they basically have a dead man
candidate walking now let's get to the
vice president
pick uh the my
certainty that it would be kamala harris
has been
challenged recently but not for the
reason you think
now i do know that there's a lot of buzz
about you know susan rice etc
i have trouble thinking it's going to be
susan rice
as vice president and the problem is
that she's got the worst case of
rbf any politician ever had
and you know what i mean right you can
look you can google rbf
which is basically a a resting face
that uh looks unpleasant now when she
smiles she looks very pleasant and
apparently
i saw a report that she's smiling more
maybe because she's
jockeying for the vp job but
she has a unfriendly look that is
frankly
scary um i saw karen
karen bass recently uh on an interview
and i think the cuba stuff is
is pretty bad i don't think she can get
past that
um so my guess would be
well let me let me give you the big
picture there are two things happening
one is we think that the vice president
pick for biden will be important
because biden may not be a two-term
president well actually he said he would
not be a two-term president
and that puts that person in the first
spot
to be considered as you know to run for
president next time
but here's what's different i think
biden
is failing faster than maybe we even we
know
and that his advisors may be calculating
this they may want to pick a vice
president that is not
kamala harris wait for it
so that when biden is replaced before
election day
they can bring in a top-tier candidate
who's
more like the presidential candidate
because the thing about
kamala harris is she always looked like
she could be the president
which is what makes her a strong
candidate for vice president when you
think of
karen bass do you think oh she's already
ready to be president you don't think
that
you're not familiar with her enough
about susan rice
do you say to yourself she's ready to be
president i don't think she's been
elected to anything
before we don't know much about her
haven't seen her campaign
so it seems to me that there's at least
a small possibility
now i'll put this in the in the
anything's possible category this is not
a prediction
in the anything possible category one of
the reasons that the biden
vp choice might be delayed which is what
we heard it's going to be delayed again
it could be that they want to pick they
want to put in a strong vice president
but not one who's too strong
because they might want to save their
strongest candidate
which in my opinion is harris to replace
biden himself at the top of the ticket
before the election
nobody else has told you that have they
which would really blow your mind
wouldn't it and uh harris is still
unpredicted as
a possible top of the ticket i don't
suggest
betting on on the basis of what you just
heard
but i just put it out there she's still
unpredicted
all right
did you see the new trump campaign ad
it's really good it's really really good
one of the things that people were
complaining about is that
uh it's one thing to say bad things
about joe biden but what's your
positive image you know positive message
for the country
and the trump campaign just turned out a
really
inspirational feeling uh
you know pro optimism
pro america everything's everything's
going to get better and better
and i think they nailed it just in terms
of the
the skill that went into the the ad i'd
say a plus
it's one of the better ads i've seen you
actually feel something when you
when you watch the ad and that's that's
kind of hard to hit
right you know not every political ad
makes you actually
feel something but that actually that ad
literally
you just feel it and it feels good
which is the point um
speaking of optimism and feeling good so
when you see the ad
you see a version of trump that's his
best self in my opinion
optimistic trump is the best
trump which is also my explanation for
why he did not
get the messaging as perfectly as he
could have
during the coronavirus because the
coronavirus situation the pandemic
absolutely requires something closer to
pessimism you know that pessimism or a
little bit just a slight pessimism
was exactly the right note to sound for
leadership
in a pandemic it's like uh i got to tell
you it's going to be bad
but you know we'll get through it but i
got to tell you it's going to be bad
so that's the message people were i
guess they wanted to hear
a lot of people said that and president
trump is not
really the one he's just not optimized
for bad news he's optimized for what
this campaign ad shows
which is hey let's get on board and
rebuild this thing so let me put her
let me put it in a larger context i
don't believe there's any such thing as
a good president or a bad president
i believe that what you need is a
president whose talents
are the right match for the times and
that's why i was more pro obama than
probably just about anybody who's
watching this right now
because i thought he was a good match
for the times
and i think trump is a better match for
these times
with the exception of the pandemic he
was not a good match
to that so if you say president is good
or bad i think you're missing the larger
picture
that they're all good i mean by the time
you become president of the united
states
you're you're a high functioning person
you're smart yeah you care about the
country
they're they're all in that category of
smart
capable successful care about the
country i think that's all about equal
but they are different in how they fit
so in my opinion president trump was not
the best
messenger and i'm talking only about the
message part
he was not the best messenger for the
coronavirus stuff
but as we're getting closer to the other
side of it i don't know when that's
going to come but we're certainly
getting closer to the end of it
who would you rather have as president
to rebuild the economy
i mean think about it seriously if you
could pick
any president of all the presidents
from the beginning of time you know
you'd have to adjust to make them modern
thinking
can you think of a better president to
rebuild us from a pandemic
which basically kept all our assets in
place largely
but we had to think our way through it
you know you had to try harder
you had to be optimistic that's what
drives the economy optimism
you couldn't come up with a better
president for this moment
oh no not this moment the the next
moment
so the next moment we're getting into
that's trumpville all right here you are
entering trumpville
you're not in it because the pandemic is
just not his strong part but man you
don't want
joe biden to be running the next phase
if you ask me would joe biden have been
a good pick
for the the current pandemic i don't
think so because i don't think he would
have closed china soon
you know i think he would have done some
other things wrong but it wouldn't have
been a disaster probably except for the
closing china part maybe
but you don't want him rebuilding
america that's just the wrong guy for
the job
i keep reading on cnn that trump has no
plan for the pandemic
and i i keep asking myself what's wrong
with me
that i think he does let me tell you
what i think is the plan
for the pandemic which seems crystal
clear to me
and i don't know why it's not crystal
clear to everyone because we're all
watching the same news i didn't i didn't
go
research it i just watched the news
completely clear plan of how the united
states is handling the pandemic
now if you do you think it's clear i'm
going to go through it what i think is
the plan
but is there anybody here who would say
they don't understand
the plan i want to see in your comments
when they
they catch up to real time so here's
what i think the plan is
they were always very clear from day one
that keeping our health care system
intact was going to be
and keeping people fed were the top
priorities
everybody's on board right it was very
clear
we're going to make sure we feed
everybody and we're going to make sure
that the health care doesn't collapse
and then we executed that plan did it
work
yeah yeah it not only did it work
when things were far more uncertain but
it looks like it's going to continue
working
so that's the first part of the plan
hospitals and food
and nailed it i i would i would give
our country as a whole you know more
credit to the health care workers of
course
but the country as a whole for that part
of the plan a plus
a plus for all of you not just the
president
um trump is very clear about wanting to
open the schools
how much clearer could the president be
that he wants the schools open how is
that not completely clear
now the states of course have individual
you know
powers that they can do what they need
to do but it's also clear that the
president has
has acknowledged that the states are the
ones to make those individual decisions
but he's giving very clear guidance
about the the federal priorities and i
believe that that is
correct because states have a slightly
different
mission than the federal government
the states are not responsible for
national defense
president trump is responsible for
national defense
in addition to everything else states
don't have a national defense
motive they're they're more about making
sure you got
food and medicine and stuff and
i would argue that trump from the
national defense
phase trying to keep schools open
keeping the economy
as open as we can you know with some
pullbacks as needed
those things go right to national
defense and the president's completely
clear about them
got to get kids in school got to keep
the economy you know humming which
helps to have kids in school and
that the economy is sort of the
lifeblood that makes everything else
possible and if you don't if you
if you break the economy more than it is
then nothing works nothing works so from
a
you know keeping the whole country
intact it makes complete sense
that the president's preference for
opening the economy opening the schools
with casualties with casualties
nobody is kidding themselves there will
be casualties but also casualties no
matter what you do
so i think that's clear and it also
makes
as i said perfect sense that the federal
government has a different
view of it than the states and they have
exactly the views you'd want them to
have
you want the states focusing on the
people
you want the president to focus on the
people but also national defense
so there's your difference um the
president has said forever
as have the experts that we're gonna
rapidly adjust
we're gonna try it adjust try it adjust
have you seen that happen yeah yeah
we've tried things and we've adjusted
tried things and adjusted still doing it
is that smart is that a good plan
yeah that's not just a good plan that's
like the best plan
you could get you come up with a better
plan in the face of complete unknowns
come up with a better plan than trying
things and quickly adjusting
there isn't one that's the plan it's the
best plan
it's the only plan and then
but there's this bigger question about
you know sort of an
end point you know what how does this
get resolved
is any of what i've talked about getting
us to something that could be
described as an end point we're trying
to get because i think that's where the
disconnect is
and here's my take although this may not
have been said
explicitly it seems obvious to me
that the priority is to keep the economy
alive
as long as it takes to get to any
combination of herd immunity
therapeutics that really you know kick
butt
or a vaccine that really works but
the therapeutics and the vaccine
are optional you get that right
so the plan is to get all three of those
things in a good place
get your some herd immunity some
therapeutics
some vaccines we don't know you know
what that mix will be or exactly the
timing
but it's very clear that the you know
with this warp speed
process that the president put together
that's
crystal clear that we're rushing
i don't want to say rushing we're
speeding
the um the vaccine thing trying every
thera
therapy funding everything that looks
promising
just throwing the kitchen sink at
anything that could work
but if none of it works
any better than what we already have if
we never get a better therapeutic than
we have
if we never get a vaccine it's still the
same plan
we just get there through herd immunity
we get there the hard way
so i don't see how this could be any
more clear
is there any part of this that isn't
number one
exactly what you'd want your government
to be doing
and number two working
in the sense that it's being executed
just the way it's described
and number three it has an end point a
very specific endpoint
we don't know the day but that's that's
the real world right
you don't know when it's going to end
but it has to have an
end herd immunity will get there
if the vaccines and the therapeutics and
everything else
does not now here's a prediction that i
made that you're already seeing
come true in a small sense we'll see if
it's a trend
i predict it will be in what world
can some other country get this under
control and keep it there
there is no world there's no rational
logical way
that some other country from the united
states
let's say australia is going to get the
virus under control
and keep it that way under current
conditions
it's not even a thing so every time i
hear the news talk about
some country who did well i just shake
my head and i say
ah they didn't do well they did not do
well
because they're going to have a flare up
all they did is tamp it down and hurt
their economy more than they needed to
we did the opposite you know we kept our
economy a little more open
we could have tamped it down further but
that was a rational choice
because all the countries that hurt
their economy
and close down to get rid of the
flare-ups
it's all coming back everybody who
closed their economy
completely to try to get something like
zero
infections in their country was a
complete waste of time because it's
coming back
you know until you have until you have
some
technological breakthrough or something
i don't think it's going to happen
quickly enough so you're going to see
flare-ups in other countries that by
election day
will make the president's performance
look better
by comparison because remember that the
curves are not timed with each other
so at the moment australia is having a
pretty bad flare-up and they have
somewhat draconian
measures apparently only one of one of
your
members of your household can leave the
house once a day
what somebody says apologist
you must be new here uh miles
carney so somebody's calling me an
apologist
all right you get blocked for that but
i decided that the lowest level of
political understanding
is calling somebody an apologist well
calling me an apologist would be the
lowest level of understanding
all right um
so did you have you are you following
the uh ai
stuff there's a artificial intelligence
program i guess you could call it called
gpt-3
i think this is elon musk's and
other peoples and it's available to some
people who are playing with it and you
get to see the results so i've seen the
results of a number of experiments
and the idea is that the ai is now so
smart
that you can you can ask it a lot of
eska to do a lot of different things and
you don't know exactly what's going to
come out of it
which is the the freaky part that you
don't quite know what it's going to do
because it's sort of making up its own
mind how to add a deal with your request
and it can do some amazing things
one of the things that was demonstrated
is it was
writing its own ad copy for a product
to which i say uh
to which i say
that's pretty freaky isn't it writing
advertising copy
ai now what it did was is i guess they
seated it with you know one statement
about their product and then the ai gave
it a variety of different
uh options that say the same meaning but
they use different words and
different emphasis and there's a second
part of that
which is that the ai can then rapidly
test it in the public
so now that you know that it can give
you different
advertisements you could you could
arrange them on a page differently
you can change the words it can go test
that with
a thousand people while you're sitting
in front of it
so you could be sitting there saying all
right ai
uh fix my advertising and you'd watch
the screen
you know change until there's there's
you know several different options
and maybe photos and arrangements and
stuff
and then you could say all right ai go
uh
a b test until you have the best one and
it would take
five minutes for it to have tested all
of its messages around the world you
know by running
ads just to see what people click on and
it would tell you the best one that
would just
absolutely rewire people's brains and it
would do it to five minutes
and you wouldn't have to do any work you
would just sit there and say
give me an advertisement go test it
that's scary stuff now if you're
thinking that the robots are going to
take the manual jobs
well of course they will but they're
also going to take the copywriting jobs
the advertising jobs i think the
advertising
industry's got some challenges coming
um do you know uh bernard carrick
bernie carrick uh was he the police
chief in new york city at one point and
he said this which is really interesting
he said must begin looking at who is
bailing out
these people meaning antifa uh and the
protesters
i strongly believe you're going to be
able to connect the dots
back to their organizers and funders
making this a federal crime
now i don't quite know uh
the the legal details of that but i
think he's saying
that if it's more of a conspiracy
looking
what would what is it that they use for
the mafia
what is the rule there's a law they use
for the mafia where if it's more of an
enterprise
the feds can go after it than if it's
just one person acting alone
so and i thought to myself
i thought to myself that is really
interesting
because what if this is a thing suppose
we do find that whoever is paying for
the the bail for these people
are connected and organized does that
mean the feds can take down
antiphon i don't know um
somebody tweeted a little clip
from marshall mcluhan in 1968
and now if you're a certain age you've
heard that name marshall mcluhan
in the 60s he was super famous as being
sort of the
you know the intellectual who would talk
about
how the media how the media was
programming us basically
and marshall mcluhan said this which i'm
going to disagree with
he said when humans face too much
information they resort
they resort to pattern recognition and
then went on to say that
the world is getting more complicated so
therefore
people can't sort out the complication
so they just default to pattern
recognition
and when i first read it i thought i
feel like this is half right
i feel like it's rico thank you it's the
rico laws
i'm wondering if that's what bernie
carrick was referring to
with wrapping up the antifa people as an
organization
rico thank you um
so marshall mcluhan says that when we
have too much information and we resort
to pattern recognition
pattern recognition of course is
confirmation bias
if you do it wrong if you do it right
then you're just being smart if you do
it wrong it's confirmation bias
and i would like to modify marshall
mcluhan's opinion because i think it's
dated he said this in 1968 and it
sounded brilliant and
um probably quite provocative back in
those days but here's what i think he
gets wrong
it has nothing to do with how much
information people have
it has nothing to do with with how
confused you are
or how much information you have we
always use
faulty pattern recognition and then we
and then we explain it to ourselves
as if we had made the decision logically
the only time that we use logic is when
the the situation is really simple
and there's no emotional uh there's just
no emotional
input to it at all so
i think he was close to the truth but i
don't think it has to do with how much
information you're dealing with i think
we're just always
always looking for the pattern
recognition and we're not necessarily
good at it
um so
i i tweeted something that i thought i
would get more pushback from and didn't
i don't think i got any
imagine what i'm going to say right now
that i got no pushback from that i've
seen
and tons of retweets so this is very
popular
with nobody pushing back yet and i
tweeted
it's time for all americans to join
together in fighting our common enemy
the teachers unions and then i
provocatively went on
if you think they haven't indirectly
killed more black americans than the
police
you haven't been paying attention
because
education economics and safety are
linked
so my contention is that if the school
unions have been doing their job for the
last few decades
the education of black america would be
far better because it's not it's not
that the teachers don't do a good job
individually
it's that the teachers unions prevent
competition
which means that there's a limit to how
good anybody can be
there's no competition so if you would
if they had not existed and there was
competition and education had
improved in the way you would expect in
a competitive environment
imagine how much better off the black
community would be
and everybody who was in a low income
situation so we don't even need to limit
this
to any group but because we're talking
about black lives matter i'll just
i'll just say that the black lives
matter people
have been duped into pursuing their
lowest
priority they have been duped
now imagine imagine even
i don't know even a month or two ago
that i could say this without being
canceled and the only reason i can say
it now without being cancelled
is everyone knows it's true all right
until everybody knew it was true
i kind of couldn't say it and it's this
if you think that
if you think that the police killing
of black people is a high priority
or even should be let's say should be a
high priority for the black community
you don't know how to count because the
total
number of people that will ever be
killed by the police
will be a pinprick compared to how many
people how many lives are destroyed
by the school unions the teachers unions
restricting the ability for teaching to
become good
better than it is and they're not even
close
in terms of death count we're talking
about
you know education being the alpha
problem
for everyone basically for everyone
you know not just the black community
but if you don't get that right
the education part you don't get your
economics right you don't get your good
quality
life you don't get your national defense
the country's done
as bad as the tragedies are in these
police incidents and very much we should
work on it
right there's don't interpret anything i
say
as we should not try to make that the
best situation we can make it and
experiment a little bit there
we should but let's not confuse it
for the top priority for anybody it's
not the
if you think black lives matter
that's not the priority if you think
black lives matter
you would you know you'd say well i hope
we do better on this police stuff
let's let's talk about the teachers
unions that's when black lives matter
so i don't think i could have even said
that directly a month ago
but i feel like you know now that now
that the temperature is changing a
little bit
and we're seeing that the teachers
unions are basically holding our
children hostage
think about think about the fact that
the teachers unions are basically
holding our children hostage
yes it's crazy all right
speaking of competition if you're
wondering how much better
could education be if you had free
markets and competition
i would uh i would point you toward elon
musk's
rocket which uh his astronauts just
returned
safely yesterday and i may have the
numbers wrong but it's something like
this
the mission that he that he accomplished
for less than a billion dollars
was something that nasa said would cost
26 billion
so when nasa did not have competition
they were proposing to spend at 26
billion dollars
to do a thing that once competition was
a thing
cost 1 billion that's the size
of the potential gain in education and i
think he did it years earlier than that
it was going to do it wasn't even close
all right those
those are my points for today
um yeah just looking at your
comments
can't thrive without addressing the
teachers unions yeah
so let me tie this back to the very
first part of the periscope if those of
you
were there in which i said have you been
surprised
that some of the things i advocate for
happen
as unlikely as they seem and
i don't think i've been advocating
anything harder than the teachers unions
need to get fixed or moved out of the
way
or at least stop us from having free
market and competition
and uh i would predict
that you're going to see a lot more
pressure on the teachers unions and
maybe
some alternatives popping up for
education
so i'm going to keep pushing on that i
appreciate it when you boost me on
twitter if it's some topic you think is
good for the
good for the country and join me on the
locals
platform if you want to see my special
extra provocative stuff
it's locals with an s.com and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
