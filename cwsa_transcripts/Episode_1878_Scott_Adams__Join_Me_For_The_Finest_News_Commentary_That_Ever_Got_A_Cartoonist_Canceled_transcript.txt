oh
good morning everybody
and welcome
to the best thing that ever happened to
anybody it's called coffee with Scott
Adams it's a highlight of civilization
and are you glad you're here yeah yeah
you are how'd you like to take it up a
notch
everybody
hold hands
and repeat after me all you need is a
cup of my girl glass of tanker Chelsea
Steiner canteen jugular flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure it's the dopa
Beach of the day the thing that makes
everything better
everything everything
it's called the simultaneous stuff it
happens now go
savor it
savor it
okay
well
um
I is there a setting on Twitter that
allows you to see the people you follow
has anybody found that yet any any kind
of feature
because I used to think that Twitter was
something you followed up you you
followed people
and then when they tweeted
you'd see their tweets
when did they change that
because now I just see sort of nothing
or random people I don't know
did did Jack posabic stop tweeting
did Mike cernovich just stop tweeting
used to see them every day every day now
nope nope all gone
all gone
now I know what you're going to tell me
you're going to say Scott
Elon Musk told you how to solve that
problem
you go to the interface where there's
the three little dots
three little stars and you hit that and
then you set it to show everybody an
order instead of using the algorithm
oh I did that I did that
do you think that worked
they changed it back
wouldn't you expect that if I
if I'd signed up and had a setting that
that setting would just stay there
would you ever expect that the setting
would change itself
it did
it did
because I I would never change it myself
and so when people said you know I
thought oh I'll go back and change that
a second time
so I thought I'll go back and change
that a second time
so I tried to find that menu again
do you know how well they hide that
 thing
now to be fair
if I'm looking in the refrigerator for a
condiment
I'm not going to find it
if you tell me to look for my car in the
parking lot and I don't remember where I
parked it we're going to be here a while
yep if you tell me to find something in
my room that's not where I thought I
left it
well I'll be looking for a while because
I'm not the guy who's good at searching
for things in difficult to place fine
places
so I spent some time and I don't even
think it's on both interfaces right is
it and I have already forgotten
is it on only the browser interface but
not the app or is it only on the app but
not the browser interface
it's not in both right
can you tell me
it's on both it's on both
all right
so if I picked up my app right now
like just an average user
to call up Twitter
so we'll see how quickly I could find it
now keep in mind I'm looking for
something that I know exactly what I'm
looking for
and I generally know where to look for
it
all right so it looks like you'd have to
be in the home page
yeah see part of my problem is I I live
on the notifications
and then they put those three little
dots okay it was too easy because I knew
where it was I'd just done it
but I would swear
I've spent a lot of time looking for
that thing and now finding it God
 damn it all right sorry
I'm gonna have to the uh
I've got a technical problem in the
locals thing I'm gonna fix right now
or not
uh nope it looks like that would be
so here I'm going to try to fix my uh
screen control because I'm using my
phone instead of my iPad because I've
got a technical problem there too
um unless because locals took away the
live streaming on the iPad or they hid
the menu
because I can't find it
um
so somebody said brightness
display and brightness
ah there we go auto lock never
all right
all right
um
all right let's get back to the show
going back to locals you know if I
hadn't fixed this I wouldn't be able to
concentrate so it would bother me too
much
let's see if I get the locals people
back locals are you back if you're back
I fixed your technical problem
all right um
you know you could make a real good
argument that Hollywood is destroying
the world
now not in an obvious way like it's like
a tired old argument everybody said but
in a real way
Hollywood is the reason that that uh
nuclear energy is not already everywhere
am I right
imagine imagine everything in the world
how different it would be if we had
nuclear power everywhere
would the Ukraine war look the way it
does now
not so much not so much
no it wouldn't
would anybody be worried about losing
energy you know would California have
blackouts would we be talking about
climate change would we be changing the
entire economy to service climate change
if we had nuclear energy everywhere we
wouldn't
and do you know what the argument
against nuclear energy is
let me tell you the whole argument about
nuclear energy
I saw a movie and it scared me
that's it I saw a movie and it scared me
I saw a silkwood or The China Syndrome
or Chernobyl or some damn thing and it
scared me
and then on top of that I would have a
bunch of illusions that I'm under
it's like the Illusions would be we
don't know what to do with the nuclear
waste yes we do
you just stored in barrels on site
it's it's totally solved it's not even a
little bit not solved there's nothing
left to solve it's a hundred percent
solved
and then say what what about the danger
of meltdown
the types of nuclear and nuclear energy
that is built today
has never had a meltdown
nobody's ever died
with the current versions The I think
Chernobyl was like version one
and we're on version three never had a
problem
version three never had a problem never
had a death
or a meltdown I think
so everything we know about nuclear is
wrong and most of that comes from
Hollywood
actually is destroying the world
like actually
causing a war
I mean we're very close to nuclear war
because of movies that's not an
exaggeration is it you tell me am I
exaggerating
the the popular view of nuclear power
that has kept it from being the main
thing is that people have wrong opinions
about his danger that's entirely from
Hollywood and people
who are in that domain completely
it has nothing to do with science
oh my God so here you know we always
look in the wrong places
for where the problem is the problem is
literally Hollywood
is literally most most of our operating
system for how we think about our world
all of our filters on life come from
entertainment
and the problem is that the
entertainment industry is not trying to
set your filter in a productive way
it's not tried to make you smarter
is trying to get you to buy a ticket
It's Entertainment
so if if your education and that's what
it really is you don't think of it that
way but you're being miseducated if
you're if your education is being given
to you by people who don't want you
educated
and they don't that has nothing to do
with their intentions they just want to
make money and entertain you
so I mean it's pretty obvious how we got
here we're being we're being educated by
people who don't want to educate us
they want to check us you know doing
what they want to do anyway
I saw uh Ron Clane of the Biden
Administration
uh touting U.S manufacturing jobs went
way up like quite a bit over 600 000
manufacturing jobs
now
Is that real
do you think that's real
do you think a lot of manufacturing jobs
are returning to the United States I
didn't read the article because he
didn't link to it cleverly he didn't
link to the article he took a phone
picture of a newspaper headline
okay I'm guessing if he had linked to
the article there would have been
something there about well you know
don't get so happy because maybe it
means this or that or maybe it's just
it's purely recovery from the pandemic
I mean it might be just pandemic
recovery which would mean it's basically
nothing it's just what we expected it's
Baseline I don't know but is it possible
that actual manufacturing is coming back
to the United States
have has anybody heard of a I've Heard
lots of plans
um
but have you heard of any actual Factory
that got built where somebody can point
to the factory and say this Factory is
replacing stuff we got from China
is there an actual example in the real
world of that yet because I think lots
of people are making plans to do it I
think it's going to happen
but I don't think any manufacturing jobs
have come back
because of decoupling
have they
or is it or is it like you know a big
part of it is just the uh the Tesla Giga
plants or something I don't know how
much they employ
we've got a lot of robots I guess the
Tesla robots are being rolled out
primarily for
um
industrial use
now
what
why is somebody swearing at me
why are you laughing at me
what did I do
I must have done something
made somebody out Matt
all right
apparently China is conducting a survey
to find out why its citizens are
unwilling to get married and have
children
why do you think Chinese
uh citizens are less willing to get
married and have children
what do you think is the reason
bleed future yeah yeah Bleak future
right but there's also
um I saw I saw a tweet from
um Naomi Wu who's a good follow on
Twitter
Naomi she goes by the Twitter handle uh
real sexy cyborg
if you don't like your Twitter Twitter
followers to be sexy
this would not be one for you
uh so she's a real interesting fellow
don't be thrown off
by the fact that she has gigantic tits
all right
and I think I can say she has gigantic
tits because it's sort of her brand
like it's something that it's a topic
right something she talks about I don't
know why
uh I'm not there's some story behind it
I think there's a story behind it I
don't know what it is
but but don't be don't be thrown off
uh now she's female don't be thrown off
by the fact that she is uh
uh voluptuous is that the right word
yeah her Twitter account is actually
quite valuable and I like it so one of
the things she's saying because she has
you know she has lots of connections
back in China
um that there's something called uh
who Kawa
h-u-k-o-u slash home ownership so
there's some kind of a
tradition in China
where you register your household and
that gives you access to services and
something about that system is
sub-optimal I don't know the exact
story here but there's something built
into the Chinese system which makes it
very difficult to get your own place and
have a family just something in the
system
and uh but I I think it might be more
that
um High income always reduces
population growth right
have we seen that everywhere wherever
there's High income there's low
population
yeah and then you add that to you know
growing up in a I don't know maybe the
the nature of things there is that
people don't want to bring a kid into
that world but I doubt that's true
I would imagine if you were a young
professional in China
you would have just as much interest as
every other country and having a kid or
not I mean it's not like you crane you
know if you're in Ukraine you could
reasonably say maybe not have a kid this
year
but I mean China is stable enough
that I don't know what the real story is
there but they got a big problem
all right here's the question
let me ask uh you this before I give you
my answer
the United States has a lot of diversity
compared to other countries
compared to most countries right there
might be some that are better
is our diversity our strength or our
weakness go
is diversity a strength or a weakness
I'm Saying answers all over the place
but both is the correct answer yes both
now if you don't think uh diversity is a
strength
uh are you enjoying watching the uh
Japanese American basketball teams that
are dominating
so just take one country in Japan so
Japan has low diversity
can Japan compete with the United States
on high tech pretty well pretty well
how's their basketball team
not so good
so we we can compete on high tech even
beat them and then we can beat them in
sports
now
sounds a little racist doesn't it did
your racist antenna go up and go Scott
are you saying uh black people are just
good for sports or what kind of racist
thing are you saying there no I'm not
saying that I'm saying the very opposite
of that I'm saying that the more
diversity you have
the more likely you're going to have
people who will fit any particular need
be it Sports be it art be it singing be
it fashion be it you name it I don't
think it's an accident that the United
States dominates in a bunch of different
ways
I think we have entire populations which
for whatever reason
tend to excel at various different
things so we've always got somebody
who's going to be great at anything
and I feel as if
you add that to the fact that we're the
ultimate Talent skimming country
if you were in another country
it doesn't matter what country you're in
let's just say you're you let's just
start with you
and you're you were contemplating going
to another country because you wanted to
improve your life maybe you didn't like
whatever country you're in
wouldn't you hesitate to go to a country
where
everybody was different from you
like I try to imagine myself moving to
let's say Pakistan
and I'm the only like like white guy
walking around
I'd feel pretty uncomfortable
I don't think I'd do it
if I imagine uh moving to let's say
Switzerland
fairly diverse but mostly diverse within
the white looking people and I'd say to
myself oh
you know maybe I could fit in better
there because now I'm not talking about
myself I'm talking about a person
talking about themselves
but then you look at the United States
what do you see when you see the United
States from the outside
don't you see in the United States that
it doesn't matter what you look like you
still get a good shot
oh you'll be discriminated against sure
we we have plenty of racists everybody
does you'll be discriminated against but
you can make it
in the United States you'll be able to
find plenty of people like yourself
not all of them but you can find a
pocket like yourself and you know get a
little support there and then Branch out
and next thing you know you're living in
my neighborhood which is got a little
bit of everything
right so here's my argument I think the
United States has a dominant advantage
in having somebody who's good at
anything
and I really think that makes us special
number two we are the ultimate Talent
skimmers from other countries and we
should and Trump was smart about this
Trump understood that we're the ultimate
Talent skimmers we can get the best
talent from every diverse group
we don't have to get their their low
performers we can just get the you know
the highest performers and we get the
best of everything if you get the
highest performers from every group
racism is just stupid
it's just stupid at that point because
you'd be like okay yeah even if you
imagine there's some like average
difference between groups
even if you imagine there is
and I'm not saying there is even if you
imagine it if you get just the best
people from each group
you're in pretty good shape
now now here's my more controversial
statement
I think we already do
and it doesn't mean the best as in you
know highest educational achievement
I am absolutely in love with the fact
that we're a pirate ship
we're a pirate ship the United States is
we let everybody in you just got to be a
pirate
all right but now correct me if I'm
wrong I might be making this up just to
make a make up a good analogy but we're
actual pirate ships kind of diverse am I
wrong about that
yeah does anybody know enough about
actual pirate ships were were they
diverse
because I thought they were
it doesn't matter I mean it would be an
interesting point if they were well no
women okay no women yeah
but the the the United States and and
I've always described Trump this way
Trump's personal life is like a pirate
ship and his supporters are like a
pirate ship
do you know what it takes to be a trump
supporter
it doesn't take your skin color you just
have to want to be a pirate
that's all
you're you're what do what do Mega
people think of black Republicans who
you know are
compatible with the the Trump movement
love them
love them unambiguously
love them
because they're Pirates right who
doesn't love a pirate come on you know
that teacher in Canada who's got the uh
allegedly is is transitioned to a woman
but probably is a prank
probably is a prank it's the one wearing
the enormous prosthetic breasts and
going to school
that's a pirate
that's a pirate
I want that pirate if Canada will give
us that pirate I want that one
now I hear I'm making assumption that
it's a prank
I feel confident in that
it could be wrong but I'm just using it
as an example
so give us all the Pirates we'll take
them Pirates are great
and by Pirates I mean people who are
willing to break the law to get here
you know not real pirates not the kind
they're going to kill people but the the
kind who say you know
I want to be American and I'm going to
break a law to get get there
and and by the way I respect anybody who
says they're law Breakers and therefore
I disagree with you Scott completely I I
respect that opinion
that was a completely
completely respectable opinion I just
like Pirates
I'm not saying I have a super good
reason for it
all right
um
and I would say that we have less chance
of War because of our diversity
because you can't get enough of anything
to get a proper Civil War
right if we had sort of two types
and you know the two types were even
whatever you know republican or democrat
or or only black and only white
something like that that would be a
problem
but you can't even find families that
aren't diverse anymore
I mean is there anybody here who has a
family that's all white
like you're you know your cousin no but
nobody married anybody black you know
nobody married Hispanic
oh some of you do
it
well how extended are you talking about
like even your cousins there's nobody in
your whole family who married anybody
isn't White
your whole family
yeah well that tells me what kind of a
bubble I live in California right in
California it's almost unheard of
in California the
um you know the racial ethnic mixing is
just so it's so thorough
that you can't really go to a party and
it's going to be just a bunch of white
people I don't know if I've ever seen
that in California
in New York yes Upstate New York yes
all right all right well that was a
little wake-up call for me thank you all
right
well uh
are we still uh
every day I go to Fox News and I turn it
on and it'll be a new video of young
black people usually young well not even
young but black men
and sometimes black women beating up on
people are not black
now
I'm starting to worry about Fox News a
little bit
because
on one hand
it's getting hard not to notice that
when the Wawa was overcome and there was
a you know Riot there that all of the
faces on camera were black
am I supposed to ignore that
we are supposed to right because it
would be racist to point out that the
inner city violence is
if you believe what is on film it's
entirely a black problem
can I say that
is 2022 can I say it out loud
that no smart person would ever go live
where there are a lot of low-income
black people already living
can I say that because I believe that
would be true for a high income black
person as well what high income black
person would intentionally go live where
there are a lot of low-income black
people living
I mean I'm sure it's done
but it's got to be rare because it
doesn't seem like a good good play
do you think that in 2022
you could be a non-racist and do the
following thing
choose the place you live by the fewest
number of black people who live there is
that racist
in 2022 is it racist
to choose where you live
to be away from as far as you can from
black people
it's technically racist but because the
the using that proxy
is almost exactly the same thing as
staying away from crime if you talk
about low income High income
everything's different right I've got a
black neighbor
am I worried that my black neighbor is
going to you know Riot my 7-Eleven
no no he's well off you know the it's a
well-off couple they're doing great
I'm not worried about them
so I'm not trying to stay away from them
they're awesome
but yes I think we should be able in
2022
and here I will fly close to the Sun for
you so you don't have to you you know
how close I am to being canceled right
now right
but I'm doing it because I think the the
conversation has to be at least a little
bit more honest
and I'm kind of in that place in my life
where I can be honest on your behalf
we have a black people problem in this
country with crime in the inner cities
now again if you said Scott that's so
racist you said black people and clearly
it's not black people it's the
low-income people in a certain situation
correct correct don't be don't be thrown
off by shorthand
shorthand explanations
we're all on the same side here
do you think there's any black people
who want more black crime no
we're on the same side let's just talk
about it honestly
and here's a little more honesty for you
if this helps
why
like what's what's the reason
is the reason that black people have
some genetic defect
not as far as I can tell because when
black people have money they're not
writing stores
it looks like a money problem doesn't it
and primarily it I don't know if it's
anything else
but the obvious thing is that people
with money don't riot
people with people with jobs right now
now you're going back to another level
and you're saying
fathers
I disagree completely with the father
interpretation
not because you're wrong all right
there's going to be a Nuance here that
some of you may not catch
I definitely agree that if you had a
mother and father and they were both
functional that's your best situation
can we agree on that
can we agree that best situation is a
functional mother and father no question
but when you say the problem is fathers
you act like that can be fixed
by just saying well be better fathers or
or what like how do you fix it no
there's something beyond that all right
the father thing is also an outcome
that's not the root cause
so the the one of the reasons this can't
be fixed is that conservatives are
obsessed with the father thing
the right
but it takes you down the wrong path
because you can't fix it
there's no fixing that
how in the world are you going to fix
that there's nothing even close nobody
even has a suggestion
let we've gone decades and nobody's even
suggested how that could be fixed am I
right but where where is the plan
where where is the policy there is none
that nobody has any idea how to fix that
so if you say to yourself that's the
root cause well then you've just given
up because there's no way to fix that
so let's go back further
systemic racism is the problem
now some of you may not believe that's
the problem but I'm absolutely convinced
systemic racism is the cause for why Fox
News can show a video every day
of black people killing non-black people
in the on the street right
it's not because
some weird genetic Oddity is because
somehow we got here
and the way we got here was systemic
racism
specifically
specifically who
you know who white women
white women are the cause
it's all white women
I'm sorry
is white women who are teachers and run
the teachers unions that's it
the whole problem with black
crime in America is white women
if white women
had done the job for the people instead
of the job for themselves
which is what is good for teachers
that's what teachers unions do it's not
the teacher's Union's job to
help you be successful
not at all the teachers union is to help
the teachers be successful it's not for
the kids
so we have a system
which rewards people
for not doing the work
or rewards I'm independent of whether
they do the work or not now what would
be the way to fix that how do you how do
you change the situation where any
rational American would stay as far away
from black people as they could because
that's where we are
and I and again
when I say any rational person I include
black people
you telling me if you're a
this your generic black citizen of the
United States you telling me you want to
go to the inner city where you know it's
mostly black
because there's going to be a lot of
crime there nobody wants that and this
isn't as racial as it sounds right and
if we can't talk about it as bluntly as
I am
about why does it look like the problem
is all black people and crime
why does it look like that it's white
women
ultimately they're the cause of it all
it's just white women
and do you know why white women
can do this and have this much power
because they own white men by the balls
why men don't have a power over white
women
I'm not saying they necessarily should I
don't know if I I don't know if there's
any reason that they should I'm just
saying that's a description of the
situation
the way women have all the power
and they've decided to destroy uh the
I say the underpinnings of the nation
because it's good for the Union
good for them
now I'm oversimplifying everything right
but sometimes oversimplification can can
kind of move you down the road a little
bit then we can add some Nuance from
there
yeah let me say it again
for everybody to
[Music]
uh White masks or something I know
that's gonna happen
foreign
I'll give you some background you
back
I didn't support it to anybody supported
his protest you know that I tried to
work with black lives matter to actually
see if I could you know write up some of
their recommendations for police
interactions to see if I could help them
that didn't go anywhere
do you know why
there wasn't any interest in Solutions
and I had to I had to actually do the
work to find out that was true it was
really about the the organizers just
hadn't made jobs for themselves that's
all it was black lives matter was
basically organizers who created jobs
for themselves
that's all there wasn't did you see that
no recommendations ever came out of
black lives matter
because they didn't need any solutions
they weren't interested I never saw any
interest in solution at all
so
that's where we are on that
um
so I the reason I'm reminding you that
is that I'm all about the solution
and if saying blunt things that make
people mad at me so that they'll argue
with me gets me more attention
then I'm going to use that to help work
on Solutions
you already know that uh I've been
turning my one book into a teacher's
guide
so it'll be a curriculum and teacher's
guide and what it teaches you
is How To Succeed even if you have a big
disadvantage
so it should be exactly what anybody
who's low income would need
and if there's any way to get that
especially into the black population I
would think that strategy would help the
most did you see what happened the other
day when I said it in public that a
black candidate of equal equal
qualifications has a five times
advantage over a white candidate
did you see what happened when I said
that in public
yeah I I got I got some pushback
but very little
it's 20 22. I think things are changing
a little bit the things you can and
cannot say are always changing and then
there's something happening here there
are things I think that at least some of
us can now say out loud
you can't yet you don't have freedom of
speech like I do
yeah I have freedom of speech because
I'm willing to pay for it I guess it's
not free huh I I the only reason I can
do it is I
I know what the price is
the price is full cancellation and
destruction of my reputation
economic destruction that's the price
and I say okay
because I can afford it you can't afford
it
but I can
so I'm going to try to help the black
population of this country as much as
possible
and I do think that
going directly as systemic racism as as
it permeates the education part of our
entire structure and really ruins
everything above it that if you're not
on that you're not doing anything
everything else is just blah blah blah
blah
let's talk about fentanyl
um I don't want to bore you with like
the same old fentanyl things and I know
that for most of you it's not really a
big issue it's not like inflation you
know touches everybody
but fentanyl is getting bigger
so with your permission
this will be the
toward the end of what I'm going to do
today
um I want to present it as
um
persuasion lessons
would you find Value in that so I'm
telling you how I'm persuading and I'll
let you follow along so you can see
technique as it happens because I think
that's useful so it's one thing to talk
about persuasion technique and it's
another to see it actually employed in
the real world as it's happening
and the one thing the funny thing about
persuasion is you can describe it
to the people you're persuading
I'm using this technique right in front
of you it still works it doesn't make
any difference at all that's the weird
thing about persuasion
all right um
number one uh
Fox News is one of the biggest causes of
the Fentanyl
problem
Fox News
is one of the biggest causes
of the fentanyl emergency
you ready for this argument
today as a perfect example is a big
article a major article in Fox News that
says that uh the too much fentanyl is
getting across the border and the
Biden's uh Biden's border policy is
worsening the fentanyl crisis
right so Fox news reports that the
Border
the Biden's border crisis you know his
bad border control is worsening
the fentanyl crisis how is Fox News the
actual cause of the worsening crisis
tell me
why is it that Fox News is actually
literally there's no hyperbolear
literally a major cause of the problem
is it not obvious
because they've diverted all of your
political energy to the wrong place
they know they can draw you to the wall
right wall wall
illegals oh any other any good reason
for a wall is good with me throw
fentanyl in there the wall has almost
nothing to do with the fentanyl problem
you could throw a baseball full of
fentanyl over the wall and it's enough
to poison all of San Francisco
if they catch 90 of the fence at all
there's still plenty ten percent would
be enough to light up the whole country
right the border wall has nothing almost
nothing I mean it helps I'd still do it
because you need to do it for other
reasons too right it's not just about
fentanyl so I I'm strong on border
security
but every day that FOX News tells you
that border security and Fentanyl are
the same topic
you are being over badly they are
 you so badly I mean they're
really doing a super disservice
if Fox News ever educated itself up to
the point and maybe it does now it is
just choosing to make money this way
this could be just a money-making thing
if they would ever properly educate
conservatives we'd have a chance
but Fox News is telling you all the
wrong stuff and so you're getting all
worked up about border stuff and
thinking doesn't it make sense to you
that if they fix the Border well there
there's your fentanyl problem right
there so why don't we do what we know we
should do fix that border and then I I
got the border and I got the fentanyl
fix too no Fox News is lying to you or
they don't know
but it's a gigantic
emergency that they're misinforming you
this badly
now I don't know if CNN is doing the
same thing but I don't think CNN is
saying the Border is the big problem I
think CNN is doing a version of this
that's almost as bad here's the version
that's almost as bad
en caught more fentanyl at the border
than Trump did
so therefore Biden's doing okay right
because they captured more fentanyl than
Trump did
that doesn't tell you anything
there's no information in that you think
there is oh there used to be this much
fentanyl but they capture this much
therefore there's less available no
nothing like that happened
nope no let me explain what happened
yesterday when fentanyl was let's say a
hundred pounds
and they caught
let's say half of it
so they got 50 pounds
and then the next day there was ten
thousand trillion pounds that
went across but they only caught one
percent of it
was it more or less the second day when
they only caught one percent of it it
was more
it was way more
so have I ever taught you that if they
tell you a number without the percentage
or
the percentage without the number
they're lying to you
if the News tells you the number without
the percentage it's a lie if they tell
you the percentage without the number
it's a lie it's propaganda
every day that you see the tons or the
number of doses that's captured at the
border that's a lie by the news
and if you think oh good news they've
caught a bunch of fentanyl no no that's
a lie
maybe they did catch it they may have
caught this much but if they don't tell
you what percentage that is of the whole
or they don't tell you how easily it
would have gone been to ship it a
different way
do you know why it comes in across the
border
because it's easy
if the Border were secured you know
where it would come through
somewhere else
just send a FedEx
you tell me you can't mail fentanyl
FedEx
really you tell me you can't vacuum seal
some pills
in a FedEx box
and wash the vacuum pack so there's no
smell
and just put it in a fat accent or
whatever the mail is and mail it
of course you can you tell me you can't
put it on a boat
and drop it off on the you know any kind
of boat because you don't need a big
boat because it's so small right
all right so here's some of the the
persuasion that I'm using
um
which uh I told myself I was gonna
have on my notes but instead I'll be
reading them off my tweet
so I did a Twitter thread on all the
illusions of Fentanyl
some I've mentioned before but you're
going to want to hear these again
all right so I so I started out by
saying that Fentanyl and nuclear power
failures are the same problem
so here's the first persuasion trick
I'm comparing fentanyl to nuclear power
as I did earlier in both cases
the problem is an education problem that
we have been fooled into thinking are
policy differences they're not policy
differences
their education differences if you
educate somebody on nuclear power
the two of you will be on the same side
in two minutes
assuming they believe you right
with fentanyl same thing
the only people who think they're
disagreeing on policy are because
they're not educated on it everybody
who's educated in policy ends up at the
same place I'm sorry everybody's
educated on fentanyl ends up in the same
place same with nuclear so this is
purely an education problem and the
thing that keeps us from being educated
is a bunch of illusions
so there are Illusions about nuclear's
risk and there are Illusions about what
you can and cannot do about fentanyl in
both cases these are
education problems but special kind
because it's not just telling you stuff
it's removing a hardcore deep illusion
and education doesn't do that
let me say that again
if you have if you have no preconceived
idea education works great
you know young people coming to school
they're told things for the very first
time works great
but if you've got a deep bias education
doesn't make any difference at all
it doesn't even touch it
so that's the problem with fentanyl is
that the Deep biases are not subject to
better information
all right so here are the watch the way
I
were these
so we're going for the persuasion
technique here right so first of all I
did a thread in list form you know one
through whatever
threads tend to get a lot of attention
and they get retweeted and they go
through spread readers and stuff so if
you want to make a bigger point a thread
gets it done better than one tweet so
that's the first drink
um
so here's here's what I said number one
people believe demand can be reduced
so people believe that you can reduce
the demand for fentanyl but I said but
no one has ever seen that approach
succeed anywhere
we only believe someone else knows how
to reduce demand
so here the trick I use here is
anticipating what somebody's going to
think and say
if you can anticipate their objection
and then call and then cut it off before
they say it
that's good technique
and what I anticipate is that many of
you are saying it right now of course
there's a way to reduce demand
of course there is and then if I asked
you to describe it you'd say well
there's somebody who knows how to do it
there's a group that does this there's a
group that does rehab there's an entity
that does this and I say right that's
what I said you believe someone else
knows how to do it
so do they
everyone believes someone else knows how
to do it that is the illusion
if anybody knew how to do it that's all
I'd be talking about
if anybody knew how to decrease demand I
wouldn't talk about anything else
that's all I would do all day long I'd
be hey let's use this technique that
people know how to use reduce that
demand
if it were a case of building more rehab
I'd be trying to give funding for that
but nobody knows how to decrease demand
anywhere no one in the world no one in
the professional world no no one
anywhere
if you see it
you are mistaken it doesn't exist and
there's nobody who's tried to help an
addict who think this thinks it does
they've actually looked
I've spent a lot of time looking I'm not
guessing
it doesn't exist
and as soon as you lose the illusion
that you can cut demand
then maybe you can concentrate on
something that might might work right
um people believe that if you cut the
fentanyl precursors that are flowing in
from China and now India by the way so
apparently China did put enough pressure
on their dealers that some of that is
moving to India
so I don't know if that means China was
a little more serious than I gave them
credit for
or not it's a little opaque
but people believe that cutting the
fentanyl precursors that come from China
and India to the Mexican cartels won't
help
they say if you cut the supply from
China through the cartels it won't help
because if you do that they'll just Make
It in America
because it's not hard to make people say
well they'll just make it in garages
like meth
to which I say no that's an illusion how
do I know that's an illusion because
it'd be happening right now
why would you get your why would you get
your chemicals from China and India and
the cartels if you could make it in the
garage
the the profit margin on fentanyl is so
gigantic
that if anybody could make it in the
garage they'd be making all
kinds of it like meth right meth is made
in garages because you can
that's why they do it because you can
there's no but you don't see fentanyl
made in garages do you know why
well it has to be because you can't
it has to be what other reason would it
be there's no economic reason
there's no legalism because illegal
things are done in garages all the time
but think about it
if it were possible it'd be happening
now what I assume is happening is it's
too hard to get the precursors in
quantity to anywhere except a lawless
place
at least illegal precursors to a lawless
place so I think it has to be
manufactured in a lawless place that
does not have American surveillance
state
have you have you noticed there haven't
been any major uh terrorist attacks in
the United States
it's got to be the surveillance state
it has to be because there's nothing
else there's no other possible thing it
could be it has to be that we're
catching them fast because we're just
catching every communication now
if AI is monitoring communication for
terrorist stuff and you know it is
you don't think they could look for
fentanyl related
vocabulary
of course they could
now I don't think that they do that now
with meth labs
do you know why
why wouldn't they do it with meth labs
and just dealers in general Coke and
heroin do you know why they probably I
don't think they're doing it do you know
why they probably don't
because the problem's not big enough
the problem is not big enough but the
fentanyl problem is the federal problem
is not a drug problem
the fentanyl problem is a terrorist
attack from foreign countries
if you have a terrorist attack from a
foreign country
even if it's being made in a garage in
you know Encino
I believe that I believe the
surveillance State can turn on that knob
and and catch those guys right so I
would think that this fentanyl dealers
even small ones would get picked up by
the surveillance state
if they were in this country I don't
know but for some reason and I might not
know the real reason it doesn't seem to
be something you can make in a garage in
the United States or it would be here
already
um the other myth is that people believe
the Portugal experience with
um I think they legalized or
decriminalized drugs and made it easier
to get made it safer a lot of people
think that worked
so therefore we should imitate that
that's just an illusion
if that worked we'd already be doing it
so would everybody else
it obviously didn't work
if it worked we'd be doing it
so do you can find articles that say it
worked but go deeper just Google
debunked Portugal drug experience just
put it in debunked
see what pops up and you'll see what I
mean all right so obviously it didn't
work well enough to spread
so forget about that one
uh people believe here's another
illusion people believe that personal
responsibility is sort of the beginning
and the end of the story it's like hey
just let them die
if you have druggies want to take drugs
and die let them die who cares
now I have some
empathy for that point of view it's not
crazy
it's not crazy
but it ignores the fact that if a
hundred thousand people are dying you're
affecting about a million Americans a
year
it's really expensive too
this is super impactful on everybody
and if you if you're not impacted yet
it was 50 000 deaths a few years ago
now it's a hundred
is it slowing down
nope where do you think it's going to
stop at what point does it get your
attention that it becomes your problem
too
5 million
10 million
and we're going to get there
all right I started yelling at 50 000 a
year
and it's doubled since I started yelling
about it it's not going down
so it's going to get to you too
um
people believe that addicts can make
different choices if you provide the
right support
another cat they can't addicts can only
do what addicts do
they can promise you anything but all
addicts lie
do you know why I know that all addicts
lie
you could just ask them hey addict
do all addicts lie yeah of course
of course we do
the addict will tell you that themselves
they all lie
and
they'll lie about some things right not
everything
um
so addicts are only going to do what
addicts do now here's why you're fooled
by that you think some people can be
helped because you've seen it happen
right how many of you have seen somebody
used to be an addict
but now they're not they cleaned up that
exists
so you're saying to yourself um Scott
why are you saying that that doesn't
work I know all kinds of people all
kinds of people that got better from
addiction
here's what you're missing
all the people who decided to get better
got better
it didn't matter what method they used
all the people who wanted to do drugs
just kept doing drugs
what do you think is the largest
population of people doing drugs the
ones who decided to get off it are the
ones who think this is pretty fun I
think I'll keep doing it the problem is
people don't want to
the people who decide to do
now I'm I'm of course using some
hyperbole here for a fact right
I don't want to stop every three seconds
and say but of course there are
exceptions of course I'm not talking
about everybody in all situations right
you should have that little recording
running in your head this doesn't mean
everybody I'm just talking about
averages that sort of thing
all right but in general uh the people
who want to do drugs cannot be talked
out of it
the people who've decided on their own
for whatever reason and deciding on your
own
can be influenced by your family but
it's still your decision those are the
ones who have decided they do have good
results
often
uh people say that the addicts who buy
fentanyl know their risks they they know
what they're getting they know the risks
they're taking they die them
that's what some people say
you say that so Jenny says that they
know the risk
Jenny
the people dying are not the people who
are taking fentanyl intentionally you
know that right
the people dying are the ones who didn't
know they were taking Fentanyl so that's
an illusion that you can
you can reduce it to while they do the
risks they don't know the risks
now let me explain uh what an attic
brain is
hey addict
the risk of you dying from this pill I
have in my hand is 50 percent
there's a 50 chance if you take this
pill you're going to die there's also a
50 chance you're going to have a great
High
so don't do it right give me that pill
got it
it's an addict as soon as you make the
mistake of thinking that an addict would
think the way you would think
you're gone you're lost yeah it's
Russian Roulette
you don't know you're getting fentanyl
you think you're getting something much
safer you think you're getting Xanax for
example and you're not
you got offensive
so while it's true that and let me give
you the exact conversation I had with my
stepson right before he died of Fentanyl
stepson you know that there's fentanyl
in all the street drugs that you can't
tell right yes I do I would never take a
street drug because you don't know
what's in them could be fentanyl yeah if
there's one thing I know for sure I'm
definitely not going to take any any any
sketchy drugs because they might have
fentanyl in them I know the risk
dead in two weeks
dead in two weeks of fentanyl do you
think he knew he was taking Fentanyl
nope because I don't think he would have
intentionally taken fentanyl it was
probably just in something else yet
and so decisions all that stuff none
none of the thinking deciding none of
that applies to addicts
right he was an addict yes he's dead now
he I was very much an addict
um
and and you may have noticed I have
resources
so we did everything like every year
rehab every everything just everything
none of it made a difference
um
I talked about the border wall then
number eight
people believe the U.S government when
they tell us how successful they are at
catching Fentanyl
why would you believe the government
is catching more Fentanyl and they're
doing a good job why would you believe
anything about the government
you know I talked about it if they don't
tell you the percentage they're lying to
all right
um people believe the government of
Mexico should step up and it should be
we should pressure the government of
Mexico to handle those cartels
um
I had to break it to you
I hope I'm not the first one to tell you
this
about the the government of Mexico
it is the cartel
am I the first one to tell you that
hadn't heard that
nope
no the government of New Mexico is
controlled by the cartel they don't have
any control over the cartel the border
is controlled by the cartel the
government of Mexico doesn't even uh
they don't even police their own border
the cartel does
if you didn't know that you're really
confused about fentanyl
people say we don't want to start a war
you know with Mexico or China especially
we don't want to start a war
that is an illusion
that's an illusion we're in a war
our only choice is to fight back or not
that's our only choice we're not
deciding to be in a war or not in a war
we're in a war
we can only win or lose or decide to try
but we can't decide not to be in a war
who gave you that decision
that's purely imaginary you don't have
any War not war decision when it comes
to Fentanyl
um
people believe that legalizing
relatively safer drugs
would reduce the number of
of overdoses because if the problem is
you don't know what you're taking
wouldn't be great if you did
and you get some legal drugs
um
but here's the problem
you could test that in one ZIP code
easily couldn't you
just take one ZIP code and say all right
if if giving everybody free I don't know
oxycontinent or whatever the it
would be
we'll try it
it's never going to happen
yeah San Francisco did this
crazy this crazy uh like needle
injection site thing
and that turned out to be a complete
 but
don't you think that it's possible you
could you could test variations on that
theme
now they did needle injections and
everything else suppose you just took
one ZIP code and said
um anybody here who wants an opioid in
pill form
come get a government opioid pill
and at least you'll know that that won't
kill you and you'll get a pretty good
high
would the addicts take the government
pill
what do you think would addicts
agree to take the government pill to
stay safe
what if they have to give their name
uh I think people would go get free ones
and then sell them
although that wouldn't make things worse
yeah so here's the thing this might work
this might work
but I don't know if there would be
um unintended consequences and I don't
know if it
helps the way you hope it would it might
keep people in permanent zombie form
do we want that as opposed to dead do
you do you feel better if uh if your
child became an addict and was just a
zombie for 30 years versus dying in the
first year are you happy if they're a
zombie for 30 years
does that make you happy because now you
solve the fentanyl problem they didn't
have an overdose but they're an addict
for 30 years
I don't know I'm not so sure the death
is
any worse than that
um if Free Will is an illusion how do
you decide
you don't
you do what you do
and then later you said I decided that's
how brains work brains rationalize after
decisions once you if you don't realize
that everything's confusing once you
realize that your brain comes up with
your explanation after you decide
for important stuff not for a little
stuff
then everything makes sense again
if you want a world where everything
makes sense
be compatible with science science
confirms the the rational part of the
brain doesn't even activate it doesn't
even activate until after the decision
we know that for sure
all right
uh methadone somebody says
um
oh Narcan encourages more use
I can see that
I can see that
I've heard that the uh the Pfizer
antiviral
might make it easier for you to catch
covid if you've had the antiviral
there's some speculation on that I think
the data is is lacking
but there's some anecdotal reports of
people who took the antiviral did not
build up enough immunity
now I did see and of course all data on
pandemic stuff is hard to believe but I
did see some statistics suggesting that
even if you got the mild Omicron version
and you got it without any Therapeutics
which is my case
in theory I have almost complete
immunization for a long time
did anybody see that story I think there
was a study that said that that the
actual so I feel like
it's possible I played it
just right by accident it's not like I
was smart or anything but
uh
I think I reduced my chance of serious
long-term covet and death a little bit
getting the initial vaccinations but
that was mostly to travel
um
and that I didn't get any boosters after
that so that when I got the I got the
full Omicron by the time I got Omicron I
didn't have any vaccination left in me
in terms of protection
so I got the full Omicron and it kick my
ass
but if I recover from it and I'm not
sure I have actually I think there might
be some long covered still there I'm not
sure
uh I should have the best immunity for a
while
uh
yes
um my
so I have some kind of muscle problem in
my legs but today it was better
you're rationalizing after the decision
well except that I told you my decision
before I made it
so rationalizing after the decision in
this case I don't think makes as much
sense because everybody admits they were
guessing
if you guess and then you guess right
that's just lucky
so what I'm suggesting is not that I was
smart I'm not I'm not saying that I'm
saying I may have a guessed just right
but not I'm not claiming that was based
on my Superior knowledge or reason it
may have just been an accident
and if and and to your point
had I gotten a blood clot
from the first vaccinations then I would
say I guess wrong
when it would have nothing to do with my
reasoning ability right wouldn't you
agree
that if it had gone the other way I'd
say I guessed wrong I wouldn't say I was
really smart but I got bad luck
many people did not guess I'm sorry the
the
the worst take is that some of you knew
that's the worst take in the pandemic
yeah you've watched a world in which
there isn't a single thing that's
credible there's not any data there's
not any
uh I lost the connection there
there's no data whatsoever that's
credible on the pandemic especially in
the fog of War there are still people
who will look you in the eye say I knew
no you didn't
nobody knew it wasn't noable you may
have guessed right too
and if you guessed right I give you
credit
but you guessed you guessed
new Alzheimer's study is that the one
that said it makes it worse
is there a study that says
covid made your Alzheimer's worse
I'd like to think it fixed it
start eating meat now
I don't think that's the answer because
I do eat fish so it's not like I'm not
getting protein
all right makes it worse yeah probably
makes it worse
all right that's all for now
I'm sure I drove everybody away with
that last conversation but
um did you see the Alan Schiff is doing
a make you think past the sale on the
January 6th stuff
So Adam Schiff says
that any decision to
um
to turn over the January 6th stuff to
prosecution
should be made
unanimously by the January 6th group
so any any recommendation to the
Department of Justice should be
unanimous now of course it would be it
would be unanimous because they're all
on the same side
but do you see how that's making you
think past the sale
do you see how clever that is
he is making you wonder if it would be
unanimous
which makes you think
that it must exist
which is not demonstrated at all
I I've not seen anything that looks like
it's even close to a crime for Trump
so so Chef is telling you to think about
whether it would be unanimous
instead of thinking about whether it
exists
it's good technique
shift is Shifty
all right that's enough for now
I'll talk to you tomorrow
