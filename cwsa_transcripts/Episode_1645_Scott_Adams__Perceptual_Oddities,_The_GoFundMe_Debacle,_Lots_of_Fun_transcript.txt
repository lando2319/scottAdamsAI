hey everybody
welcome to the best thing that a well
probably will ever happen to you really
if you think about it it's called coffee
with scott adams and a lot of people
are getting addicted to it all over
from the children walking out of school
in oakdale
to the
freedom truckers and the freedom convoy
up in canada
trying to claw back some human rights
from their
overreaching governments we'll talk
about all that but first the
simultaneous
what do you say what do you say
oh how about uh grabbing a cup or a mug
or a glass a tinker chelsea steiner
canteen drug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like freedom
and join me now in the
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
oh yeah
oh
yeah
so
yeah facebook slash meta is having some
stock problems
and
um first of all i don't own any direct
facebook stock
so i like to mention that
you should remind me to tell you that if
i ever forget if i'm talking about a big
company
because i think that's always fair
um but i don't have any facebook stock
and here's the reason
i don't know any kids who use facebook
am i wrong
show me some kids using facebook and
i'll be all in on that investment
[Laughter]
this is this is something
i heard long ago i i don't think i'll
give an attribution for it but uh it was
a long time ago and a a very skilled
investor
once said don't invest in anything a kid
wouldn't use meaning that it's not going
to be around that long if kids have
already rejected it for whatever reason
so now they might use they might use the
metaverse
i think
i think zuckerberg is always
maybe underrated
for how good he is as a
as a leader and ceo and
and all the rest i mean how many people
how many people were as good at being a
startup person
as they were at running
an enormous company
there are not too many people like that
right
michael dell
probably uh
bill gates
yeah yeah elon elon musk right yeah
there so when you hear about something
like that it sticks in your mind
all right um
here's
a tiny little story that could be
gigantic
this will sound like oh a little little
technical breakthrough maybe and you
know these technical breakthroughs you
always have to judge them with a grain
of salt right will they ever turn into
anything real or is it just a
sciency article
well here it is the um this was tweeted
by a victim texan
and says mit engineers create the quote
impossible new material
that is stronger than steel and as light
as plastic
so has something to do with
i don't know
two or three dimensional polymers and
blah blah blah so apparently there's a
way to construct a material
but of course the hard part would be
could you ever make that industrial
production
right so it's probably reduced to an
engineering problem at this point but
imagine what would happen to
oh let's say
everything
if you could make
something without steel
that was better than steel and way
lighter like way lighter
everything changes right
suddenly
what can you carry with a drone
well a lot more because the drone itself
won't carry it won't weigh much and the
things you're carrying might not weigh
much
what about guns
is somebody going to make a gun out of
this
and if you did would it show up on an
x-ray i don't know
beats me does do polymers show up on
x-rays
um
think about what would happen to climate
change
and our need for energy in general if we
start putting out cars that weigh i
don't know half as much
could we make engines out of it
what would happen if the car doesn't
weigh much more than the people who are
in it
what does that do to your gas prices or
your electric prices by then i guess
so this is one of those tiny little
stories
that tell you why you can't predict
anything
you know when when i hear that the
climate change
prediction models
are telling you what's going to happen
in 80 years
there's nobody who's worked
with prediction models who thinks that's
even a thing
because of this
and all of the other things that we'll
be developing between now and then you
know maybe we get hit by a meteor maybe
we have you know contact with an alien
force
maybe
the ai singularity is reached maybe
actually that's almost a certainty
think about this
here are two predictions that all the
smart people
would agree on now when i say all the
smart people that's not that doesn't
mean they're all right
i just mean the the people would be
generally considered society's
wisest most informed people
they would say that climate change is
going to get real bad based on the
models
and they would also say that
a.i will reach a singularity
certainly within 80 years
i don't think there's anybody who thinks
it's going to take that long
but what what good does a
climate change model prediction have if
somewhere in that period and probably
almost certainly
way closer to the front than the back
ai is going to reach what's called the
singularity
in which the ai can learn on its own
and once the ai can teach itself
and it becomes you know self-growing
it becomes almost instantly you know
omnipotent
for all practical purposes because it
would know how to control humans in a
variety of ways
so if it wanted to it could hypnotize us
brainwash us
it could blackmail us
you know by saying i'll turn off your
power it can do anything
so what good does a climate change
prediction that goes 80 years ago you
know what good is it if our ability to
predict goes absolutely blind
a day after the singularity is reached
does everybody understand that
our human ability to predict anything
we will go completely blind because
whatever happens when ai becomes a super
entity
we don't know
there just isn't any way to predict that
it's sort of like um
people saying that i was reading the
minds of somebody who's smarter than i
am
and i'm thinking
if i could read the mind of someone
who's smarter than i am
i would be as smart as them because i
would just look in their mind and say
well
i don't even have to think for myself
anymore i'll just look in the mind of
you know somebody smarter what is jordan
peterson thinking about this i'll just
look at his mind
just adopt that
view
so anyway if if we could figure out what
ai a super entity or a super
intelligence would do
we would be super intelligent
but we're not
so it's just a blindness
that's probably
what would you say is there anybody on
here who's got enough ai
experience to predict when the
singularity will be reached
10 years
i think 10 years is not the outside
what does anybody say
because the the thing with this kind of
prediction is whatever happens let's say
i say it's going to happen in 10 years
whatever happens in the last two of
those 10 years
will probably be more than happened in
the first eight
so you know none of this is linear at
some point it just goes root
we just don't win that don't know when
that happens
disagree with the hypothesis which i
think i think there's room for
disagreement on the hypothesis
i also think that humans will rise to
the challenge
because we see it coming
if we didn't see it coming we could be
surprised
but i think we'll have all kinds of
fail-safes
and things that even an ai can't get
around
yeah all right
anyway my point is how good can we
predict anything speaking of not being
able to predict anything the job growth
number was through the roof
like incredibly positive
and
the experts had said it was going to be
dismal
how long have people been predicting
economic things
that's that's something we've we should
be pretty good at right
if we can predict anything
we should be able to predict what the
next jobs report will be because the
next jobs report is what every week or
is it every month
but
whichever it is the the point is that's
a pretty short period of time
if you can't even guess the
job growth number
when almost everything that's a factor
is reported and there's data available
you can't even get that right
they were off by a mile
and they don't even know why exactly
nobody's exactly sure why
so
we can't predict uh
climate change because the ai we can't
predict economics even the most basic
stuff
how much job growth
within the next few weeks
that that is really basic
we can't even get that
yeah well we the experts can't
so that include goldman sachs and jp
morgan
were off by a mile i guess
all right are you
watching the update of the kids in
in mask cages
in oakdale
a school district area in california
so as you know the first part of the
story is that the kids
without masks were told to stay in this
cold unheated
gymnasium i guess
but they quote escaped
so the news is saying that they were
barricaded in
and then they escaped
and then i saw a picture of the
barricade
does anybody see a picture of the
barricade that was barricading the doors
so they couldn't get out
the barricade was on the inside
just look at the picture
it looked i think the barricade was on
the inside it was just folding tables
there'll be like one folding table that
was leaned against
the doorway it wasn't even leaned
against the door
it was leaned against the doorway
now i think all it was was like putting
up orange cones basically
yeah it was it was all of the complexity
of putting up orange cones or
or a ribbon
it was just sort of
it was just sort of indicating that you
shouldn't use the door
the the difficulty of getting past the
barricade would be this
push open the door
because because the barricade only went
up like
two and a half feet so just push open
the door
and then
step over the two and a half foot
barricade
so here's the funniest part
apparently it took the kids a while to
figure out that they could escape
because you know what you can't do in
california
you can't physically constrain a
teenager
did you know that now now law
enforcement could if they caught them in
the act of a crime
right and depending on the crime but in
california you could walk into walmart
with a big old bag that says
bag for stolen items
you could stand in front of the police
the entire police force that might be
shopping at the same time and say hey
guys
you know
blue lives matter
you could fill up your your your
stealing bag with stuff you could say
huh can you guys give me a hand this
bag's a little heavy
just to get to the car
i know it's illegal i know it's illegal
but do you know that in california
that's not enforced
hey well sorry if you want help i'll
just drag it
drags it back to the car
police open the door for him
say have a nice day sir
in california you can't physically
restrain somebody
for almost anything
unless you know it's like immediate
health or safety issue right somebody's
like about to murder somebody or
something like that but the example
would be if you had a let's say a
teenager who is an addict just to pick a
random example
could you physically restrain that kid
and say okay
you can't go out tonight
because you know you're grounded
so you can't go out
and the kid walks stands up and starts
to walk over the door
what are you allowed to do legally
nothing
nothing
you can't you can't physically restrain
a teenager in california
for anything short of like the most
dangerous stuff immediately happening
so at some point all of those kids were
sitting in the
in the gym
and none of them realized at least for a
while
that all they had to do was stand up and
walk out
and they were staying in this cold gym
but at some point
the the brainwashing
must have uh turned off
and i don't know that this happened
but if they still had their phones does
anybody know if they had their phones
when they were in that gym
because i didn't i didn't hear anything
about the phones being taken away
so if they had their phones they were
probably in contact with parents
probably one of them was a lawyer
i'm just speculating what might have
happened and at some point i feel like
some adult somebody outside the room
said um kids
you know you could just get up and walk
out right
like any time you want somebody says no
phones
so maybe they just figured it out or
just took a chance
but i i think the funniest part about
this was the
perceptual part where they had to stay
in the gym
they didn't have to stay in the gym
there was absolutely nothing keeping
them there except their minds
and it almost worked
it almost worked it was just their minds
they were keeping them imprisoned now if
that doesn't tell you something about
humans i don't know what does
these kids were so
mind controlled
that they thought just the thought of
you should stay in here during your
protest that would be good enough and it
would just stay there
well that didn't work out
i told you yesterday that i was joking
that you could reduce
gun murders by 75
by uh banning guns to democrats
and everybody had a good laugh at it it
got it got kind of viral got a couple
thousand retweets i think last time i
looked
and everybody laughed because it was one
of these you know sort of funny but
absurd
things that if you denied guns just to
democrats you would reduce murders by 75
and of course some people there's always
a troll
who doesn't get the joke
and the trolls will be in there oh i'd
like to see the
the data
show me the data that supports such a
provocative claim
and then today's somebody tweeted out an
article that said
70 of felons or registered democrats
and i think there's a slightly higher
number
involved in violent crime
so yeah i've told you before that
one of the things that happens if you do
data analysis for a living which i used
to do for years in my corporate life
you get this weird ability to predict
things that you shouldn't know anything
about and you're not even sure why you
just you just sit there in a chair and
go
i think about 75 of crime would go down
if you got rid of guns from just
democrats
and uh
turns out
might have been kind of close
it might have been close
so the republican
national committee the rnc they uh they
censored uh cheney and kinzinger their
own republicans
for their involvement in the january 6th
panel
what do you think of that
do you think that that was appropriate
now i think it's fair to say this was
purely political act
so you know
to the extent that it was a purely
political act it's neither right nor
wrong it's just a political act
but i just wondered if you liked it
so some of you liked it some not now i i
kind of get i see both sides
that this is one where first of all it's
not important in any way right
can we all agree it's not important this
is the least important thing is
censoring
republicans censoring their own
but i would say that i like it as a
messaging thing it has no impact on the
people getting censored but
i like the way it frames the january 6th
thing as a fraud
because that's all it really does it's
not it's even not about these two people
so much i mean
i guess it is
you know
punishing people who are you know
leaving the the orthodoxy or something
but
um
i just like the way it frames the issue
for the republican side that the january
6th thing is so ridiculous
that you would get censored even for
being involved in it because it's so
obviously a propaganda
thing
which is not to say there's no truth
within it
so just
for the benefit of the trolls who will
rush him obviously bad things happen on
january 6
and i think it's perfectly good that we
find out what happened but i don't think
that's the point of it the point of it
is just propaganda right
so
if you get if you have two republicans
who
participated in something that's just
naked
political propaganda
censoring seems
seems a
fairly mild thing to do but
again it's just a messaging thing
all right
so there's a new story that i believe is
going to turn into some form of fake
news
and it is that
spotify has
deleted some some many dozens of joe
rogan episodes from their library
and it included people who are
you think relatively
safe
you know they're not doctors claiming
things that
other people disagree with
so some of the people would be like
michael malus some of his episodes gad
sad
and even tim ferriss
now what in the world could tim ferriss
have possibly said
that got him pulled off
maybe something about psychedelics or
something like that i don't know
or
who knows
who knows but i think what we're going
to find out is that the reasons things
got pulled off
we might be surprised
so i would say at least wait to find out
why they were pulled off
so i heard something on twitter just
before i got on about some of them might
have included the n-word
obviously not used
you know without knowing anything about
it
it's obvious it wasn't used in a
derogatory way they may have been
talking about the use of it or something
like that
but
um
i don't know that that's the whole story
71 episodes somebody says
dr malone used a dilbert cartoon in a
recent sub stack post is that true
that would be interesting
okay well once again i end up being
connected to some major show well i was
a little bit disappointed that when i
checked the list of the 71 or so
episodes and by the way you there's a
website that just tracks whatever has
been pulled out of the joe rogan library
so you can tell which episodes have been
deleted by spotify
uh you just go to jre
missing.com
so jre as in joe rogan experience
jremising.com so i went there and i
looked for my name
you know because i i was interviewed
once appeared on
the joe rogan experience once
but i did not get banned and uh
i was instantly disappointed
because i don't know if you've met
has anybody noticed this but i like
attention
anybody i know i try to keep it under
keep it under a
lid but
it's true
sometimes i like attention
so
i don't know what it would take to get
uh
my episode yanked on spotify
but if they don't yank my episode
um i'd like to announce now
that i'd like spotify to pull the
coffee with scott adams
podcasts
uh i'd like them all to be removed
unless they remove
all of michael malus's remaining
episodes
no just kidding i like about that i love
michael malus
but i feel like i should announce
something to get some attention here oh
by the way the whole barbara streisand
thing was fake news did you all hear
that
so i talked about that yesterday
that uh
apparently there's a problem of a number
of uh artists who are being brought into
the story who have nothing to do with it
so she's another one
but i feel like i should i need to
announce something to get some of this
free
free publicity
what should i announce
i need to announce something like
if spotify doesn't remove
my podcast from spotify
then why should i ask for
what should be my demand
maybe it should be some joe rogan
oh by by the way here's a uh
somebody mentioned my head warts
[Laughter]
i'm going to uh just take a mild detour
here
years ago i learned one of the most
important things i've ever learned in my
life it was somewhat accidental
i had laser
treatment on my face for something
called spider veins you know little
little red veins you can see on the
surface
and just so just for cosmetic reasons i
had them lasered years ago and with the
old laser the old lasers it would look
you just turn purple and it would look
like you got punched
so
i knew before i got it that i i didn't
want to go in public for a week or so
maybe longer
because you just look like a monster you
know you look like you you just been in
a cage fight basically
and
it took me exactly two days
to be so bored
just staying in my my home
that i said oh screw it
i'll go out and if people look at me and
mock
or whatever they do i won't be bothered
i'll get over it
and then i went out and i believe i went
to the mall you know where there's just
tons of people and i kept waiting for
all their their stunned and horrified
reactions
and you know what happened instead
nobody really cared
nobody
nobody asked me about it nobody appeared
to be staring
nobody appeared to have any reaction
whatsoever
at all
and i literally was walking around like
a monster
now that was one of the most
incredible impactful experiences of my
life
because my prediction would have been
that people are going to react and then
that's going to make me feel bad
or inconvenience me or something and
absolutely nobody cares about stuff like
that
so your your comment about you can see
these
you know these imperfections here
um i had a very
a very simple uh
dermatology treatment where they take
this frozen stuff
and they they spray your head or
whatever part of your body
if you've got any kind of gross or any
you know age spots or things that don't
belong and somehow and this is the most
amazing thing ever
this can of of cold whatever spray this
is somebody in the comments will tell me
what what it's made of
this this freezing thing that they spray
on you
somehow can identify
what doesn't belong
liquid nitrogen is that it
somebody's saying liquid nitrogen but i
don't know how it doesn't
but these are not just
i'm not talking about pre-cancerous
these are not
um all pre-cancerous treatments they're
just things that don't belong
and they have a variety of names you
know like a keratosis this or
maturity spot that or whatever but
somehow
this freaking magic nitrogen spray
sprays they just all they do is they
like cover your eyes and they just go
and all of your good skin completely
ignores it
completely ignores it and anywhere that
there's something that doesn't belong
is it like nukes it and then you have to
wait a while for you know it to heal how
the hell does it do that
i mean seriously
how the hell does it do that
and i thought here's another one of
those things that should be a business
by its own by itself
so for 250 dollars
somebody took a spray can and went
for all of
less than 30 seconds
and i paid 250 dollars for it and a
perfectly happy customer
how much training do you need
for something that if you don't get it
into your eyes you're perfectly good to
just spray it anywhere
well don't listen to my medical
advice
anyway it's a weird uh experience
all right uh
did y'all hear the story about the
gofundme
so the truckers the canadian truckers
the freedom convoy
somebody started a gofundme and it got
up over nine million dollars to support
the
truckers you know feed them and give
them logistic support i guess
and gofundme decided that they would
suspend it and not not give the money to
the
gofundme organizers
but because they had problems with the
organization that are a little vague in
my mind
uh they decided that first and by the
way they've revised this
so at first they decided they would take
that money that it donated and they
would give it to qualified charities
what
like i read this story and i thought i
can't be reading this right
i couldn't possibly be reading the story
right because of all the ridiculous
amazing jaw-dropping
f'ed up things you've ever seen in your
life
has anything been as ridiculously effed
up as that
now
as you might imagine
the public
exploded because it's just ridiculous
and uh by morning goof on me
had reversed
and they said oh you know due to public
outcry we're going to automatically
refund it to the people who donated it
now that's a little better
how about how about they should have had
automatic refunded as maybe option a
in what world is option a we'll take the
money you intended for something else
that will decide what to spend it on
in what world
did anybody in that company get together
and have a meeting and they all talked
about that and they said you know here's
what we're going to do
we'll just take the money that very
passionate people who are exactly the
kind of people who complain because they
are literally supporting protesters
that's what we're talking about
we're going to take that money and what
do you think we'll just say we'll just
give it to
charities that we think are good
everybody in the room you okay with that
and then what did the other people in
the room say
was there anybody else in the room at
gofundme
just one person who said
um
i i hear what you're saying
but in my opinion
that would be the dumbest thing any
company could ever do in the history of
dumb things
just one person's opinion did anybody do
that
are you aren't you genuinely curious
what the meeting sounded like
i mean if if i could get
an audio of that meeting because at some
point the executives had to talk about
it right it wasn't one person's decision
how in the world did that meeting go
because i don't think
do you think you could meet one person
in your actual life who thinks that was
the best way to handle that
it's literally an online company and
they couldn't figure out how to reverse
charges
what that's their whole business
taking charges on stuff and
presumably reversing them sometimes
well then people reasonably asked did
you do the same thing for black lives
matter or
antifa when they had their gofundmes and
the answer is
nope
apparently uh
gofundme thinks they can pick winners
and losers here
now
uh
you realize that uh gofundme is only two
letters away from go me
and there's a robust read news uh comic
to that
to that degree
uh on twitter right now you can see it
all right and i guess the convoys are
the convoy idea is growing now there's a
massive freedom convoy in
in helsinki
outside parliament so there's more of
that going on
now
that's that's some of the news going on
and
as you know
at the moment
the president is democrat and congress
is controlled by democrats
am i right
that democrats control congress and the
president
and for over a year now
and so uh joyanne reed
from msnbc
uh tweets this in the context of
democrats being in control of the
government she tweets
uh fascism fascism isn't coming to
america
it's here
now dr interracial pointed this out to
me thank you doctor
dr interracial um
what what is wrong
what is going on
now my best guess about why this kind of
perception could happen is that once you
get
you know a narrative in your mind you
just can't get rid of it even when all
the facts change you can't get rid of it
so
what's up with that huh
let me tell you what's up with that
there is a new study
for a little scientific
finding i guess
that matches what uh i learned 40 years
ago
in hypnosis class actually
but science is catch it up
it's the difference between what we
actually perceive
and then what we remember we perceived
and if you don't understand what i'm
going to explain now there's a whole lot
of the world that won't make sense to
you it's one of the most basic things
you have to understand about your
your reality and your place in it
it goes like this
roughly speaking if you're watching a
tennis match and you're trying to decide
or even playing one you're trying to
decide if that tennis ball hit a line or
was inside or out
this is approximately what your brain
sees
all right now this is just
my strange representation but you don't
actually see the ball hitting the line
and and we know that
like that's been studied specifically
you might see the the ball before it
hits the line you might see it after
but the point at which it hits the line
is almost always
imagined
it's drawn in
your brain fills in blanks and then you
have a clear memory of it because you're
arguing it and you're saying that that
was clearly in and your your opponent is
saying i saw it and that was out
that was out now both of you have a
perfectly clear memory
because what you remember is perfectly
clear
it's just that there was never any input
that matched what you perfectly remember
so some people will look at this mess
and their
their brain will create a fairly
accurate story which you could determine
by having it videotaped and playing it
back
so some of them would maybe even by
accident
interpret it exactly right and they
would know where the ball hit other
people would have a perfect memory a
perfect memory
of something that didn't happen
now you have to understand that this is
how all of your life is
it's not restricted to these little
fast-moving objects
or so has nothing to do with the nature
of tennis balls or the speed they're
going
this is an analogy for everything all
the time
everything all the time
is scant little information coming
through your five senses
and then your brain
is a sort of a movie making delusion
generator and it gives you this perfect
memory
that you could even draw a picture if
you were a good artist you could draw a
picture of what it looked like
but it's not based on an actual memory
it's based on
an illusion
now
i did a tweet today asking people how
many of them think that i quote
trusted the government and
encouraged you to get vaccinated
of course that never happened
and those of those of you who've watched
me for a long time no it didn't but why
do so many people believe they sought
they have a clear memory
of me being a vaccine nazi
and pushing the vaccine
and and trusting the government why do
they have that such a clear memory of it
what's this
it's exactly this
some of them saw you know a couple of
dots
and then they said oh those two dots
i will take from that and form a perfect
memory
of you being a certain kind of way
and others saw you know the the larger
context of what i was doing
and even some of them
saw something that wasn't happening
but the majority of you who watched most
of my content got
at least a view that matches my own
i'm not sure if
anything's true but at least it matches
my own
so uh one of the questions people ask me
by the way is why do i spend so much
time responding to critics on social
media
any of you ever have that question
like why why does it
why does it seem like i put so much
energy into that
now how many of you think i'd be better
off if i just blew it off
a lot of you think that right
one of the most popular opinions i get
is you know scott
you should just act like you're above it
all
but it depends on the kind of comments
if somebody says to me scott
um
you're an
idiot don't really respond to that
because i'm above that
if somebody says
um
i heard you i heard your opinion and i
have this completely different opinion
so therefore you're an idiot
sometimes i think well you know there
was room for two opinions
and i don't respond to that
the ones i respond to are the ones who
are putting out a statement of who i am
that's inaccurate and damagingly so
so what i'm doing is usually an act of
um
information control basically i like to
make sure that if anybody says something
that's untrue about me that at least the
comments correct it
and sometimes i'm just drawing attention
to it so that there'll be more
correcting comments
because a lot of you are nice enough to
help correct
and it just corrects the record
because you can see that
the people's impression of me is so
wildly
divergent
that for me to be effective
and do anything useful for the world
i have to always tamp down the idea that
i believe in unicorns and
whatever else anybody thinks i believe
in
so keep in mind that when i do it
sometimes i'm just
you know i'm just having fun or having
energy from it sometimes it's part of
the show
like if i if i yell at one of the
critics here
uh it does vex me so you're seeing you
know an honest reaction in terms of
something actually vexes me
but not as much as i react you know par
part of the reacting is to make you
remember it
right so overreaction in a sense so the
overreaction is is calculated
to make you remember it so i want you to
remember what i said not what the critic
says
so keep in mind that when you're judging
me for
attacking the critics
i'm a very special case
all right let me prove to you my point
in your opinion just the opinion of the
people watching on the two platforms
locals and on
youtube
what events in the real world have i
influenced positively
what events in the real world
you know outside of me
have i influenced positively like
specifically what topics
now
as the topics go by because you're going
to see a bunch the
the point i'm trying to make
is that all of my energy for this stuff
is designed to be useful
that's it
right if i can't do things that are
useful i'm just not interested enough
because you know i do get compensated
because there's advertising on the
platforms and there's subscriptions on
locals and all that
but i wouldn't do it if i didn't think
it was somehow useful right to the
larger
public
and my usefulness would be
highly degraded
if people thought i was something else
so
of course there's a irrational component
that everybody wants to defend
themselves so if anybody's thinking hey
that sounds like a gigantic
rationalization
maybe everything is
that's a reasonable view that just
everything is a rationalization but it
is also nonetheless true
that if you like the fact that i've had
influence on any
topics
and you like that influence
that you're better off if i stay
credible
than if i let people define me
have i made my point
that if i let people define me and it
just stays up there on the internet
without being challenged then i'm less
effective
because people will say oh that guy
but if people had an idea that i'd ever
done anything useful
they would say oh it's an opinion from
the useful guy
if he was useful once
maybe he'll be useful again
and then i get listened to and then i
can double my usefulness
so so basically you should think of me
as a
no pun intended
you should think of me as a tool
and i think i think that's one thing we
can all agree on
because even my critics would agree i'm
a tool
but you should but if you if you don't
hate me you should also think of me as a
tool
and i'm a tool
which magnifies your own ability to get
what you want
because generally speaking
i'm only going to be influencing on
things that the majority of people want
am i wrong
like there's nobody who's pro fentanyl
right there aren't too many people who
say yeah keep those masks on those kids
forever
so i'm really picking things
that the public largely wants
if you want to get those things
then you understand why i have to remain
at least some minimum level of
credibility
okay
now but to your point
if you were let's say pierce morgan
you know he gets you just viciously
attacked
or i don't know if he's banned now did
he get kicked off of twitter i don't
know what he's up to lately
but a lot of his uh criticism is just
that generic you're a nazi
whatever
kind of stuff so no i wouldn't i
wouldn't respond to that stuff it's only
the stuff where they define you as
having a completely different opinion
that's the only stuff all right
there are now over 900 000 allegedly
dead from covid in the united states so
we'll hit a million it looks like
and as of yesterday
40 over 4 100 americans died from the
virus
with a seven day average of 3 400. this
is like the highest number since
january 2021.
so we're actually at a covent death high
but here's the good news
we already know that the number of cases
is down sharply
so
hold
no matter what
the the number of deaths looks like it's
going to plunge because we're just
we're just still uh working on the you
know the past infection rate it just
takes a few weeks for them those people
to actually die
so we should be
close enough where the government will
have cover
to drop restrictions
unfortunately the government has to be
the most conservative among us
because we charge them with our health
and what the hell are they going to do
except be conservative about it so it's
not a surprise that they're more
conservative than many of you would be
about
lifting restrictions
but i think we can be constructive
we need to keep pushing
and if the hospitals are
not that clogged and i don't believe
they are
and the case of cases are plunging and
it's the age of omicron and everybody
who could get vaccinated one or two all
the arguments on one side at this point
it's time to open up
and i think the public can respectfully
and non-violently
push a little harder
push harder
and
we're going to get what we want
sooner or later
you know a few weeks isn't going to kill
us right if the worst that happened is
the government
opens you know drops restrictions let's
say
three weeks after we all wanted it to
happen i mean we all wanted to happen a
long time ago but
let's say three weeks later than we
expected
it wouldn't be the end of the world but
why in the hell do we have to wait three
weeks
i i feel like all the data
and all the common sense and all the
public opinion
at least by weight of majority isn't is
in the same direction now
all right
what will uh what will be the opinion of
those of you who believe that a lot of
this was permanent
uh what happens if it's not would that
change your worldview at all
um
18 wheels to flatten the turd
it's catchy
all right
now
i'm just looking at your comments for a
moment
you think vax cards will be permanent i
don't
but you know the
the reason that i don't think have i
ever even given an opinion on vax cards
have i ever given an opinion on vax ids
you'd have to remind me because i don't
know if i've even said anything about it
in public
and what was my problem what was my
opinion
i think i sort of don't care
because here's the part that
that i believe
i believe
that if if the concern is
just whether you can get in whether
you're vaccinated or not i think that'll
go away
so i think the vax guards were supposed
to be a convenience if you're worried
that it would be some permanent way to
um
become a social credit thing
i doubt it
you know i mean i
i would hate it as much as you do if
that happened but i think the problem is
that the government has access to all
the data it wants anyway
if they wanted to control us
through data they could do it already
and i also think privacy is already gone
so arguing about losing your privacy to
the government
doesn't make any sense to me
because the government has access to all
of your data doesn't it
am i wrong
what could the government not get access
to if it just needs a reason right just
needs to tell the court oh we got a
reason and then they have access to
everything
so your your privacy went away a long
time ago the only time the only privacy
you have is being boring
the only privacy you have is being
boring that and then nobody cares
now
i'm opposed to the government having all
your
all of your personal information and
you know i'm opposed to the fact that
they could dip in there so i'm not i'm
not in favor of losing your privacy
but i do think
that we misinterpret where we already
are in that arc
we're already way past that question we
gave up our privacy a long time ago
and we got a bunch of benefits in return
now are the benefits enough to pay for
the privacy
no way to know because the privacy thing
doesn't matter until it matters a lot
right
that's the problem with the privacy
thing
it'll go from well it's now hurting us
to oh
we're all being rounded up
so
and i've also said before that
if we had
less privacy of our leaders
it would matter a lot
less to us how much they knew about us
because you'd have mutually assured
destruction basically
we're just waking up to it now yeah
yeah in terms of risk avoidance you
wouldn't want the government to have
your information that's correct it would
give you a whole bunch of benefits
that might be you know fairly immediate
and you might like them might make all
your technology work better
it might make you know the government
serve you better if had more information
i don't know
but might solve crimes you might like
that if you're not a criminal
but
uh yeah the the potential downside is
that they know so much that they can
round you up easily etc
but
what happens when we get into a world
where one person can destroy a
government
because we're pretty close to that
aren't we
how hard is it to make deadly
uh chemicals that would create your own
oh i don't want to give any ideas
scratch that
let me get more generic
let me be more generic we are entering a
phase where anybody can kill any
anything
unfortunately
now i don't have to mention all the ways
that they could do it because that's the
part i started to say but i think that
would have been irresponsible
where we're get reaching the point where
an individual will be able to do damn
near anything
in terms of destruction
but also a point where one individual
could overthrow a country
am i wrong
do you think you couldn't find one
individual who could overthrow a country
look at what one person has done
recently
he had joe rogan
maybe
you also have the video of that one
very leader-like
probably a senior in high school
organizing the anti-mask protest
in washington state
now that was one person
who probably was the primary person who
got one school to do it
now if social media allowed that to go
viral
could that have caught on
i'm surprised it didn't
you know because it was such a good
video to become viral i'm surprised
every school hasn't already taken off
their masks actually and i don't i don't
know why not actually
but
you could you could see how close it was
for one high school student to change
the world you can see what greta tunberg
has done you know whether you like it or
not
yeah but yeah one person changing the
world is happening all the time all the
time
um
all right
um
so that
is because the teachers unions are part
of the deep state you say
all right
how dare you how dare you
um so here's the question
getting back to the original point
and i'm sorry for the the big lags when
the people were just listening to this
it's usually because i'm reading the
comments to see where to go with this
but
when you get to the point where an
individual can cause immense damage then
how much how much power does the
government actually have over you
think about it
you know we have
of course it's his own gigantic problem
that anybody could be a horrible
terrorist just by
putting together a few assets
but those those assets could be used
against the government
and
yeah
so
i'm not i'm not as worried as you are
about the government um rounding us up
or doing something that abusive and
getting away with it i i think the
american model is more like the gofundme
situation
where gofundme does something that's
outrageous or tries to
and the public immediately says um
by a 75 majority or whatever
nope
see i always say that if you get the
public to agree 75 of them to anything
you will get that eventually not right
away but you're going to get it
they already round us up but not
physically yeah the mental game is going
to be the big one isn't it
you know that
here's the biggest change in persuasion
i'm not sure if you knew this
but in the old days you would try to
persuade people and it was hard to know
if it worked
right you could put advertisements on tv
and maybe they would sell more dish soap
or something but
often it didn't
you know a lot of advertisement doesn't
work at all
some would say most advertisement
doesn't even work at all
so
we didn't really know what worked and
what worked what wouldn't but what's
different now is that you could rapidly
test any message
you just spray it on the internet
you can look at all the metrics you see
what's viral what gets a lot of clicks
what gets engagement and then you can
immediately adjust
do it again
so our ability to
to know what works
and to know quickly so you can do more
of it and to know what doesn't work very
quickly so you can do less of it
puts persuasion in a whole different
category
now on top of that we've got a whole
bunch of
breakthroughs like now we can image your
brain we could put you know monitors on
your brain and find out what kind of
messages have the most
impact
on top of that
we have an industry to train you how to
do it
you know the book industry and books
like
chilty these books about persuasion
so you can read about persuasion you can
learn it you learn it from me you can
learn it from a number of places so what
used to be
closer to alchemy you know sort of like
persuasion was something that
felt a little bit more like
uh
fake science
because you were you were kind of
guessing and then you were kind of
guessing if it worked
i think it worked
but now it's science because now you can
say oh we've we've measured this kind of
message
against this kind of topic
and you know we'll have to tweak it a
little bit but we'll do that rapidly
through a b testing of messages
and then
bang
suddenly
persuasion is more powerful than all of
our other weapons
i think we're already there
i think we're at the point where
weaponized persuasion which has been you
know tested and tested is more powerful
than
most of our weapons of mass destruction
um
all right
and of course why is it we don't talk
about persuasion being the uh the
biggest
risk and maybe the biggest benefit too
why don't we talk about that more
because the people who would talk about
it
are the ones who are doing it
they're the ones who are persuading you
i don't think i don't think they want to
open the kimono so to speak got to hate
that phrase
i don't think they want to show you
the mechanism behind their own
operation
so they can't show you how persuasion
works or even talk about it because then
you would see it in their actual content
why wasn't persuasion used to get people
faxed actually the headlines today
is that in the uk they actually used
persuasion techniques to what they call
nudge
uh you know to nudge somebody apparently
they did use nudge
technology if i could put it that way
the the understanding of what persuades
in an advertising marketing kind of
world now i would say
they may have held off the strongest
versions of that
it looked like they they nudged as much
as they could nudge without pushback
that's what it looked like to me because
there are stronger forms of pure
persuasion they could for example scare
the out of you and they didn't do
that
you know they they played the they
played the fear thing
they definitely played it but they
didn't go as far as they could they
didn't go full trump
right
and neither did trump by the way trump
didn't go full trump either
trump did you notice that
you know because trump had to he had to
thread the needle a little bit he's got
to keep his supporters on his side but
clearly he was also the warp speed guy
so he's got a claim that they work and
that it's a good idea so so he was
always sort of sort of down the middle
and he dropped his entire
trump-like persona just for that topic
probably the right thing to do
but let me tell you what real persuasion
would look like
just so you can imagine what it would
have looked like
what it would have looked like let's say
if somebody like trump
had wanted to do it he would have told
you you're gonna die if you
don't get that vaccination
they would have showed you pictures of
you know way more pictures of the people
dying and ventilators i mean they could
have scared you to the point where you
wouldn't think of anything else
that they could have scared you to line
up
no matter how much you were afraid of
the vaccination they could make you more
afraid
remember when people said there's no way
that trump could beat hillary because
his ratings were so low his popularity
and i famously said at the time he
doesn't have to get more popular
he just has to make hillary less popular
and then he did
it was one of the most masterfully
strategic
you know approaches you've ever seen
well i'm not going to get more popular
but i'll bet i can make her less popular
and then he did
so he would do the same thing with
vaccinations he wouldn't make you less
afraid of the vaccination
you wouldn't have to
he wouldn't make you less afraid than
you already are
of you know whatever side effects there
are the vaccination you wouldn't even
have to mention it
he would just make you way way more
afraid of the alternative
and no matter how rational you are
if you hear it enough and you see it
visually it's the visual part that's
missing right
when you see the visual it's you know
it's a usually a photograph of a person
on a ventilator
imagine if that was video
right you usually just see a still photo
somebody's on a ventilator or or text
they could have gone full video um
showing people on
literally dying
if you showed me one video
of somebody gasping for breath
and dying and like i was dumb enough to
click on and watch it i would never get
that in my head
and
somebody says that it did happen
but um
i don't remember seeing it so it didn't
get a lot of play
anyway but you see the difference right
you might not have noticed until i
mentioned it well you probably did but
you did notice that this is one where
trump quite conspicuously decided not to
be persuasive
you all see that right that was a choice
but if the government wanted you to be
persuaded
it didn't even try
in in my opinion
in my opinion the level of persuasion
that the government used was
pretty close to appropriate
pretty close to appropriate because i
think they believed that was good
so you do want them to say what they
believe is good and you want them to
lead on that but you don't want them to
be full out brainwashers
and i think they stopped short of being
full-out brainwashers in america
there's an accusation that in great
britain they actually went too far
but in america i would say
maybe they often overshot the mark 10
but that's not really a crime
yeah what about now
at this point i feel like they're
backing off on the vaccinations
and i i think we'll just end up opening
up and
we'll probably be fine we'll hit the
million mark for das but we'll probably
be fine
all right um
and that
is all i have for today oh let me make
one more point because i saw a comment
going on
somebody said that the mass or child
abuse
imagine if the public wanted to be
better persuaders
on the mass game of children we we
haven't even
taken a serious try at it because there
would be
videos of the kids themselves
struggling with masks and saying how it
destroyed them and begging
adults to help them
that's all you need
just get some
tape a bunch of kids who really really
care about the masks it wouldn't be hard
to find some the ones who really really
think that they're being damaged by them
and just put them on video
that's all it would take
and just say and have the kids say if
this isn't child abuse what is
imagine the child saying
and by child i mean could be 12 years
old right so imagine a video where the
child on the mat says
if this isn't child abuse i don't know
what is
it'd be over in a day
but kids don't know they have that kind
of power and there are you know and
maybe it's a good thing that there are
no adults
manipulating kids into being part of
that messaging so maybe that's a good
thing
all right
the news is not serving up delightful
things as much as it should but i'm
hoping tomorrow will be better and
um
the ques okay i have to answer this
question is trump naturally persuasive
and crazy or is it craziness just an act
the craziness is just an act
um that's my opinion and you know i did
meet him i got to talk with him and
there wasn't any craziness
yeah wouldn't you imagine
if the stuff that trump does in public
was also the way he acted in private
don't you think you'd pick up on it
pretty quickly
i don't think he could hide it
right if he was actually that crazy but
in private
it's just talking to a real smart guy
who actually shows a lot of interest in
you
and i think that would be
i think the most surprising thing about
meeting trump in person
maybe not surprising to me but
surprising to anybody i tell about it
is how much genuine interest he had
about me
you know asking about how my business
model worked and
and you know insightful questions people
don't expect that often
because of the you know the caricature
that's that's
painted yeah his personal charisma
is really through the roof it's
that was the fun part to experience
yeah it's entertainment for the base
correct all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you tomorrow
