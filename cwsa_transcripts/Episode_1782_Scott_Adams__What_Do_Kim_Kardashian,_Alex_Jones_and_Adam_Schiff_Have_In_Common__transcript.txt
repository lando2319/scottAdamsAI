everybody
and welcome to
the highlight of not only your life and
my life but civilization itself
something like
13.9
billion years have
passed since the big bang
and all of that leading to this moment
think about it
if things had been just a little bit
different
you wouldn't even be here
and then i would be talking to i don't
know what dinosaur anything could have
happened
but if we want to take it up to a less
absurd level today and
probably do all you need is a copper
mugler glass tanker chalice or stein a
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
has anybody ever done it before
anybody anybody yes of course you have
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to you go
oh
i tried to get all of my senses involved
you got the touch the smell the taste
i sort of listened to myself slurping a
little bit there
i looked at it yeah everything
that's what you call a full body
experience
and
i think we just
had it together
not that there's anything wrong with
that
now
i have a question for you
how do you plan a
vacation
in the current environment
is anybody having that problem
you think to yourself you know a
few few weeks from now or whatever a few
months
i think i'll book myself a
a plane trip
and i'll take myself a
trip you don't know if masks are coming
back which would you know ruin a trip
and you don't even know if you'll have
an airplane
because the the flights are so bad right
now the number of cancellations that you
can't be entirely sure
that if you book a flight it'll actually
happen now that was always the case that
you couldn't be entirely sure
but i feel like it went from a
you know a 95
odds in your favor
too closer to
what
65 percent i'm not i don't even know
what the odds are of missing your flight
these days or at least being a day late
or something like that
i mean i don't know how you plan a plan
to do anything these days
anyway
get your flight insurance or something
because if you plan a big vacation you
don't want to blow it
you
don't all right uh i saw the best
suggestion i've seen from uh a tweet by
david boxenhorn
and he's he's helping us out with this
whole pronoun stuff and i was saying
that
what we need is some pronouns that
everybody can agree on that aren't being
used for something else
you know don't use they because that's
sort of already being used for something
else
so david suggests that since there are
all these different pronouns you get
yours you know he she they that if you
just took the first letter
from the pronouns that are out there you
could create you know your own sort of
universal one
so let's see what we'd get if you just
took the first letter of the solution
she
he
it
and they
now that would be an s and h and i oh
wait
all right so it wasn't the best idea in
the world but
i like where it's heading generally
speaking maybe you need to arrange the
letters a little differently
now somebody mentioned that
this had already been done with the
letter z
like calling calling people z
you know instead of he or she
yes he did that
and i said to myself um
almost there
i mean i can see what you're doing there
it's a brand new word
so that's good right
but here's what i suggested
could we
have a word that sounds less like a nazi
invasion
that's all
you know it just
i'm not asking a lot i want i'd like a a
pronoun that's not being used for a
completely different purpose already
is clear i mean i'm not asking a lot
doesn't make you sound like a nazi storm
trooper
is that is that a high bar
i mean i didn't think it was
but nobody's crossed it yet
so
let's see if somebody can do that
now as you know reality and parody
merged sometime in the 2021 period i
think would be when historians will call
it
and that's a period where
you really can't tell the difference
between a joke
and something serious
because
the serious stuff became so ridiculous
that the jokes you stayed where they
were and then they just merged
you want another example of that
does it does that sound like hyperbole
does it sound
ridiculous that parody and reality have
merged to the point where you just can't
tell the difference
well here's a little story from today
apparently
the atlantic magazine this this is fake
news so somebody did a fake headline
that made it seem as if the atlantic
magazine had done it
and the fake headline was the heroism of
biden's bike fall and then the subtitle
was
the president gracefully illustrated an
important lesson for all americans when
we fall we must get back up
now
now how many of you thought that
probably was a real headline in a real
in this magazine
i'll bet you
well over 90 of the people who saw it
probably thought it was real wouldn't
you say you know before you knew it was
a fake
wouldn't you say that that sounds real
it actually does
because as absurd as it sounds it's not
more absurd
than than the news that you'll see today
somewhere there will be more absurd
things in the real news today
no difference
well
as part of our understanding
of why
things aren't the way they they used to
be
uh adam dopamine on twitter
adam md
he points out that eisenhower missed one
key element when he warned us about the
military-industrial complex
so remember eisenhower gave a big speech
in his day
and said watch out for the
the people who make the weapons
working with the people in government
to make money by starting wars
essentially
and sure enough it looks like there's
some of that going on
but the part the left hand as adam
dopamine points out
is you should include the news in that
it should have been the military
news complex
because unless the news is complicit
you can't get away with it
so you really need that whole complex
and i think that's sort of a
useful uh
useful useful foundational understanding
you know follow the money
but there's somebody running cover for
the money
and diverting you
so there's somebody on the uh let's say
the
the bank heist team
whose job it is when the bad guys run
out and turn left
and the police arrive it's his job to
say he went that way and point the wrong
direction
and when i say he
i mean
all right
um what do these
people have in common
let's see if you can get this in the
comments here's your quiz three people
what do they have in common alex jones
adam schiff
and kim kardashian
go
what do they have in common
something major you know
and it's not you know not the funny
stuff something real
dog punchers that was a good guess
but we have no information
uh about alex jones ever punching a dog
so that was a good guess somebody said
they're all dog punchers
and i thought kim kardashian probably
adam schiff definitely
but no information about alex jones he
might be a dog lover so it was a good
guess but i don't think it fits
uh all had sex tapes that's a that's a
good guess
yeah um
[Music]
probably
probably but that's not where that's not
what i was going for all have dated p
davidson
checking the list yeah
that too
well okay i didn't realize there were
that many coincidences
there are quite a few of them but here's
what i was going for
i was going for they're all in the same
line of work
they're all in the same line of work
let me read them again
alex jones adam schiff and kim
kardashian same job
you know different bosses same job
and here's what their job is
it's an attenuated reality
attenuated reality
they start with something that's like
reality-ish
but they create something that's not
reality from it
for the purpose of getting attention
and then they can monetize that
attention or turn it into power in the
case of adam schiff maybe also monetize
so
none of them are different in my view
from
wrestling
when you were a kid did you ever watch
wrestling and you thought to yourself
people are saying this is fake but i'm
not so sure
this wrestling looks real to me i think
they're really fighting
and then later you learn it's an
attenuated reality
it's not reality
it's sort of a base reality there's a
you know fighters and there's a ring and
there's an audience and
and people probably get hurt and there's
contact and but it's attenuated
to get your attention it's more
interesting
alex jones
is an attenuated reality
he takes things that are at base are
true
but
adds to it you could call it a theater
theater would be exactly the right yeah
thank you
um
sean
and
and is it a coincidence that
adam schiff actually had some
script writing ambitions i think he's
written a few scripts so he actually has
a theatrical
background
and
kim kardashian
there was a recently a story
that there was some family meeting or
something
that was in the reality show
but the complaint was that they scripted
it and you know it was an artificial
gathering in which they pretended
something was real
to which i said
you just figured that out
is there somebody who watches reality
shows and thinks they're actually
watching just them just filming what's
happening
is there anybody doing that
is there anybody who still thinks
wrestling
is like a real sport
i i wonder do people think that when you
watch alex jones
do you believe that the purpose is that
you're seeing reality
is that is that what you think you're
watching
because you should watch alex jones
the kardashians
and even adam schiff doing any of his
public stuff as the same it's the same
thing
they start with reality they attenuate
it in ways they get your attention for
their own purposes
but to imagine that any of that is real
is a
is a serious misunderstanding of
i won't call it parody in reality
but if you think that attenuated reality
and reality you can treat them the same
i think you should rethink that
these are obviously attenuated reality
situations
and uh there's a new documentary or a
movie i guess you'd say coming out about
alex jones i think at the end of july
so we'll talk more about that but i was
looking at uh i just looked at a little
trailer for that
and you see just a snippet of alex jones
defending
what he does now his defense is this
that he believes what he says
to be true
and that sometimes he's wrong
and i look at that and i think
maybe
maybe
like you can't really rule that out can
you
i mean think about it think about how
easy a target alex jones is and then i'm
going to give you his defense it's
really simple it's a very simple defense
he believes what he says
but sometimes he's wrong
and i hear that and i think
all right nobody has ever presented
evidence that he doesn't believe what he
says
am i wrong
and then here's the second part
here here's the mic drop
alex jones asks us
why we treat him differently than the
new york times
which also presumably believes what it
says but sometimes they're wrong
like weapons of mass destruction in iraq
like really wrong
like like wrong start a war wrong
like that's as wrong as you can be
and alex jones says why would you treat
me differently
we both believed what we said
and we both could be wrong
to which i say
oh that's actually a complete
defense
there's nothing wrong with that defense
at all the only way the only way he
could be
thwarted in that defense is if there's
some recording of him saying
you know i make all this stuff up
now apparently there is some evidence
that he likes the conspiracy theory
domain so that part i think he said
directly i believe that's you know also
part of the trailer
but
that doesn't mean he doesn't believe it
and
i'm not entirely sure that believing
things is a real thing anymore
i feel as if we all choose things to
believe
and that
um
the reality is now
so obviously subjective
that we're a little bit aware of the
fact that we're just choosing a reality
does that does that feel true
in a little in a small way
but you can see that this is like a
trend you know like it's a socially
expanding trend
that people understand that what they
believe or what they act on as their
reality
they know is a selected reality a
decision reality not an actual reality
it's just one they choose to live in
and i think that conspiracy theorists
um
often
are making almost a lifestyle choice
to say
i'm gonna live in a world in which i
treat this as true
it's just a choice
and on some level maybe they know it
isn't true
because did you ever see somebody who
had a religion that wasn't yours
and you talked to him you're like i
don't know what's going on with this
other person
so whatever your religion is is probably
the real one
but suppose you're talking to somebody
who got it all wrong they had the wrong
religion and you look at them and you
think but do they actually believe that
like actually you really really believe
that like if you
if you put a
a gun to the head of you know a loved
one in their family and said i'm gonna
kill your loved one
you know i have some way to know the
truth
it's not possible but i have some way to
know what you're really thinking do you
really believe your own religion like
all of it
like like all the important parts you do
you believe all of that
and i think you'd find that people say
well
okay i mean if it's the life of my loved
one is on the line it is sort of a
chosen
belief
and
uh while many of you are still saying no
that's not true with me i'm actually
living in reality and
living in the real world and maybe you
are
maybe you are how would i know
the only thing i'm sure is i don't know
uh but maybe you got the right one
speaking of reality
here's what here's why
you could say with certainty we have no
news
industry in this country
the most basic fact
that you would want to know as a news
consumer
is this so biden recently said i think
yesterday uh
we need more refining capacity
and he says this idea
they don't have oil and
and
they don't have oil to drill and to
bring up is simply not true
so basically biden is saying that the
oil industry is to blame for any
shortages
because there's plenty of oil with the
leases and the
drilling capacity they already have
they just they can't refine it
and so that's a problem with the
industry itself having not built enough
refineries
now
wouldn't you expect if you had a news
industry
they would fact check all that and then
put it in context for you and then you
would read it
and it wouldn't matter if you were
reading
news from the left or the right
because these are just really objective
facts
is it true
that the industry just didn't build
enough refineries
and there's nothing stopping them
so if they did
everything would be fixed
does that does that even feel a little
bit true
i don't know what the true story is
so here's here things i've heard
unreliably
but also assumed to be true
i believe the government is the problem
with building refineries isn't it
isn't the problem that the government
either it's either state or local or
federal or regulations of some types
but
uh did i not hear a quote and give me a
fact check on this so i'm operating from
faulty memory here i think this week
the ceo of chevron this is the part you
need to check
said that he believes there will never
be a refinery built in this country
again
did he say that
the ceo said he doesn't believe it'll
ever happen
because the
and i assume that the context was the
regulatory burden is too hard
am i right
yeah
it's just impossible for regulatory
reasons
so
why not put it in central america
[Laughter]
can't everybody win if we put the
refineries in central america there's
got to be some you know are you telling
me that nicaragua
you know nicaragua was going to say no
to a refinery
with all the you know jobs and whatever
positivity it could create there
and they probably have lower you know
regulatory burdens
so couldn't uh couldn't kamala solve her
problem and the ceo chevron can solve
his problem
and basically
work as a you know as a system
try to figure out how to make all that
work as as one thing
so one of the big problems
and you see this all the time is we
treat all of our
issues like they're little silos
but sometimes you could just connect two
problems
yeah for example you've got a labor
shortage
and you know this that's the economy and
you've got an immigration problem
can't we figure out how those two silos
could work together to
fix something
it feel feels like we're we're
handicapping ourselves
by thinking all of our issues are like
in their own little channel
anyway
so it's obvious we we have no news
industry
because i can't tell
if biden is telling the truth
that the industry is to blame
or the industry is telling the truth
that the government is to blame and i
would think that both the news on the
left and the right if they knew the
answer
would report it exactly the same
oh yeah they'd love to build a refinery
but the government's too burdensome or
not
whatever it is
so i was watching the new press
secretary
biden's press secretary trying to answer
a question about you know the economy
and
her she attempted to answer it by saying
there's a bunch of stuff that isn't that
bad right now
which is true
so it's not all bad we're not in the
recession now blah blah but my overall
impression of her was she didn't seem
qualified for the job
does anybody else have that
feeling
she seems unqualified for the job now
i couldn't remember her name
is it
jean-pierre is that her name
what is her actually name so i'm at
least being respectful when i'm talking
about her
because i feel somewhat disrespectful i
couldn't remember her name
uh
all right well look
uh karine jean-pierre
karen karine
but i'm going to put a positive spin on
it
do you remember when
conan o'brien first became a late show
host
and he would do his monologue
and i don't know if he had the same
reaction i did but
my first reaction to conan and bro brian
was
oh god he makes me nervous
because he looks like he's not qualified
or he knows he's not qualified or
he just seemed so uncomfortable
in his own skin
on stage that it made me uncomfortable
but
but
then he got better
because it's one of those things you
can't really practice
yeah there's no other there's no way to
practice being a late night show
monologue guy because it's not real
practice so
and then i would argue that he became
you know one of the best at it
because he got to practice i feel as if
she could she could follow the same arc
but at the moment the
spokesperson is looking a little too
uncomfortable with what she's saying
and you do not want your spokesperson
to look uncomfortable
with what uh he or she or are
saying
so
anyway i was just wanted to do do you
have the same impression that she seems
to lack confidence in her own answers
and that lack of confidence is then
makes you think maybe the administration
doesn't know what it's doing
it's a bad it's a bad combination to
have somebody who looks
uncomfortable in their job talking for
you
anyway
but
um on a positive note
if i
may be positive
she looks like she's smart
she looks like she has you know basic
you know great capabilities so maybe
maybe she becomes really good at this in
a month you never know could happen
give her a month to see what happens
so biden administration wants to
ban
or
greatly reduce nicotine in cigarettes
and
basically throw the whole cigarette
industry into a
into a tizzy and make it easier for
people to quit
so apparently
at least there's some science of course
the industry disputes it surprised
to suggest that it would get people to
quit
what do you think of that
now
i've been an anti-smoking
proponent and even
public advocate
for decades
in public places
but i'm much less interested in what
people do in their private lives
so do you think the
government should get into this business
what do you think
i mean i do believe
that this is likely to be something that
would save
tens of millions of lives in the long
run
that would be my guess
if they get away with this
and i'll say it that way if they
actually
basically wipe out the cigarette
industry and make it less addictive
i feel like it would save tens and
millions of lives
which doesn't mean you should do it
somebody says it's like prohibition yeah
so would there be immediately
counterfeit cigarettes seems like it
right yeah it would just become an
illegal industry and we would just get
them from
the cartel like we get everything else
yeah i don't know if it would work
so i guess uh
i'm anti-smoking but i'm pro-freedom
so
ah this one's a tough one
because cigarette smoking
mostly hurts yourself
but on the other hand it
might make my i don't know my health
insurance cost more because other people
are doing the wrong things i guess but
you can't really go down that road
either
because that's you know an infinite
problem because everybody's doing stuff
that's dangerous you can't take account
into account all of it
all right i'm going to defend ivanka
trump's opinion about january 6 here
because it turns out it's pretty close
to my own
so
uh cnn is trying to point out that in
one video
ivanka said she accepted barra's opinion
that the election was fair
and
in other videos
where she was not
you know being asked by i think the
committee
she had said separately and earlier
that you know there were there were
things that needed to be looked into
in the election
meaning that
maybe there's some
some questions
this should be answered about the
election
now that's pretty different from saying
that election was rigged
and do you think that those two things
are
necessarily incompatible
here here's my take i'll overlay my
opinion and maybe that's unfair
but
uh i feel like hers is so close to mine
that
i can do this
so i'm going to defend my own opinion
i separate
the question of whether the election was
fair
from the question of whether you should
support the system
because i often think maybe always but
i'll say often
that protecting the system is going to
be a higher priority
uh
than maybe fixing any individual outcome
i just think the system's more important
so as soon as the system
elected biden i like many people said
huh
i don't know
maybe
maybe not
maybe maybe not
so i had my questions
many people had questions but some of
you will remember that i also
immediately congratulated him on twitter
and have never backed off from my
decision
that the system
elected biden
so when i say congratulation biden i'm
saying okay
i got some questions
but i'm not gonna dismantle the system
you're gonna have to give me a lot
better
a lot better evidence
before i'm gonna like break the system
because that's like the
backbone of the country
so i also have an assumption this is
part of the context for my opinion
that probably elections have been rigged
in this country
for hundreds of years
yeah maybe in small ways maybe in big
ways maybe it made a difference such as
the kennedy election
uh maybe it made a difference in you
know johnson's political life
maybe not i don't know
i wouldn't know
but
in all of those cases i would still
support you know the republic and the
voting system
so i believe that ivanka is saying
something at least consistent with what
i'm saying i won't i won't burden her
by saying that her opinion matches mine
but at least it's consistent
yet which is that when barr said
the election is fair
he couldn't know
if there was any unknown fraud
right
i mean by definition
you don't know the thing you don't know
so if there had been problems and nobody
knew what they were
how would barr know that
how would anybody so barr couldn't know
what he can now
so when barr says the election is fair
here's how i interpret it
the system
elected biden which is what i say
yeah the system did what the system did
we observed it
it might have had problems
but i'm going to support the system
until you give me really really good
evidence really good evidence and we're
going to talk about that in a minute
that there's something wrong
right and in my opinion i haven't seen
it yet
i could
i mean it's possible and i'm not sure
it's possible to audit the full system
i'm pretty sure it isn't
so i would say ivanka is on good
territory if she says she accepts the
you know the bar interpretation that the
election was fair
i interpret that just meaning that it
happened it there was an election we
observed an election it picked a it
picked a winner
so
yes that happened
um but then you should also look into it
if you've got questions that just seems
like common sense you know the system is
is better
the system is healthier
if you look into any allegations
because then you can keep making sure
that you're finding anything that's a
problem
i've got a theory that maybe a lawyer
should not be allowed to run for office
and it's a very it's based on a very
obvious and simple concept
people do what they're trained to do
that's why training works
it it wires your brain to think in a
certain way the the benefit
of learning economics
actually has very little to do with
economics
i don't know if i've ever told you that
before but the benefit of learning
economics is it it wires your brain
to simply view things a certain way
that's productive
that has nothing to do with the economy
in many cases
if you if you took economics so you
could predict the future
well good luck with that
and nobody can do that
all the economics of the world isn't
going to tell you what's going to happen
next year too many surprises
but it does wire your brain to know for
example that if you're saying something
is good or bad
you better be comparing it to something
which as amazing as this sounds is not
automatic thinking it's not not even
common sense
people will often just look at a thing
and say that's good or bad
without regard to what they're comparing
it to which is the only relevant
question
so once you take economics
you automatically see things as pairs
it's either this or that or this or that
or the third thing et cetera
so that wiring just completely changes
how you act all the time you can't turn
it off
you you could not you could not force me
to not consider alternatives when i look
at a question it's just automatic
now suppose you've been taught to be a
lawyer
don't you think lawyers get a certain
circuitry burned in
and
you know i'm not exactly sure what that
circuitry is
but if you look at adam schiff
and
you know i believe he's he's an attorney
am i right
correct me if i'm wrong he's an attorney
right i feel like they all are so
can you confirm that somebody says nope
somebody says yes
anyway it feels as if whether he's a
real one or wanted to be one
it feels as if these public hearings are
attorneys who couldn't be attorneys
like actually successful big trial
lawyers it feels like play acting for
attorneys
this show trial thing that we're seeing
and now it's like we've seen several of
them from the democrats it looks like
attorneys
trying to be attorneys
doesn't it
it's like they're play acting
they couldn't do it in the real world so
so it made me think of that you know the
old joke
those who can't do teach
right those who can't do teach and those
who can't teach teach him
well
in the in the lawyer world it's like
those who can't become you know
successful lawyers
teach
and those who can't teach you how to be
a lawyer
run for politics
and they're in congress so you end up
with like the lowest level of a lawyer
by the time you have a politician who's
also a lawyer
not not every time i'm making sort of a
generalization but then you've got these
people who are wired for this model of
how to how to solve things
all right i'm a lawyer
so the model of how to solve things is
you have some kind of this public event
where evidence is is displayed and
they're
representatives and and there's somebody
who's like a like a defendant you know
like you're accusing somebody and then
there'll be other people who would be
like a like a jury but not really a jury
because it's not a trial but we'll make
it like it's a pretend trial and then
all get to stand in front of the world
like
i'm a famous trial lawyer and i'll i'll
make my impassioned case
and then everybody will look at me and
they'll say wow
look at that impassioned case
that that excellent lawyer made who was
not good enough to be an actual lawyer
so he had to run for office
so
so much of this looks like play acting
because it is
i think it actually is
if if you put me in government what
would i be doing so much that you would
hate it
i would be saying have you considered
the alternatives have we really have we
really seen both sides of the arguments
like i would be doing that until you
were so
 sick of hearing it
that you would puke
because i'm wired that way like i'm just
wired that way
because i studied economics and you know
business etc
if you if you randomly select a lawyer
from anywhere
throw that lawyer into government and
say we've got this problem what do you
want to do about it what's the lawyer
going to do
well the lawyer's going to do whatever
the lawyer was wired to do
huh how do you solve a problem
probably some kind of a
evidence gathering then a public event
there's got to be a villain
it's got to be a jury
they're just wired that way
so we keep getting all these you know
impeachments and show trials and stuff
why
because that's who we hired
we hired people who can only do this
if we wanted to get some plumbing fixed
we should have hired a plumber
if we wanted to solve a problem
you don't hire lawyers
lawyers aren't there to solve a problem
they're there to fight
they're there to put on a trial
they're just wired a certain way
and they're wired the wrong way
for what we need them for
are you ready for the uh point where i
make my case so strongly that you'll
never be the same again
january 6
imagine january 6 if all the lawyers
were not part of the story number one
it is alleged and i may have some of
these facts wrong so help me on the
fact-checking
it is alleged that lawyer mark elias
was part of a larger effort to change
some of the election rules
partly because the the pandemic gave
some impetus to that but um
more largely because they knew those
rule changes would help the democrats
now if
if as many allege and i'm not sure how
to know this is true if as many allege
that made the difference
wasn't that the thing that shocked
republicans after the election it's like
wait a minute this didn't go the way we
were all pretty sure it would go
and it's so far off
from what we expected
that we we think there's something fishy
going on
so if mark elias had simply never
existed
and the election had been run the way
elections had always run before
maybe unfairly
maybe unfairly
republicans would have had an advantage
and trump would have won and then there
would be no january 6. so am i right so
this is the first first case if mark
elias or and people he worked with who
probably did similar things if they did
not exist doing what they did
republicans would not have said wait a
minute this result doesn't look right
and maybe it was all legal by the way
i'm not alleging anything illegal
they're probably just good lawyers and
they made sure they changed laws that
helped their clients
or their interests so here's another one
uh apparently the primary reason that
trump
thought there was some path for
uh delaying the vote or getting these
these other fake people in there
uh
fake electors
is
uh he had a lawyer john eastman
so john eastman was the one who came up
with the theories about how it would be
legal
for trump and his supporters to delay
things or challenge things or get
different electors or whatever it was
now imagine
if trump did not have a high-end lawyer
a high-end lawyer remember john
eastman's not
you know your neighborhood lawyer he's
like a high-end government lawyer kind
of guy if trump did not have that advice
would he have even bothered
if no lawyer had told trump yeah there's
a there's an argument for this would he
would he have done anything he did
no
no
no there had to be a lawyer telling him
well there's a good chance this could
work
now as in retrospect you know as we look
at it after the fact
it doesn't look like that was good legal
advice
but how would you know if you were in
the moment
if you're trump
and your lawyer says this looks like it
could work
what are you going to do over overrule
your lawyer i mean you don't know
i mean eventually you might overrule
so if you took
mark elias and whoever he worked with
probably other lawyers anavit you
wouldn't get the opinion that shocked
the republicans if you took eastman out
of it trump would have said ah damn it i
just lost the election i guess there's
nothing you could do about that
no by the way
oh and then then if you take the lawyers
and the congress
they don't even do the january 6 show
trial thing
so have i made my case
that if you took the lawyers out of the
story none of this would have happened
january 6 wouldn't even be there would
have been no
riots
there would have been nothing except an
election
it was only the lawyers that up
everything
and if
if it were not for their flying monkeys
in the press
to make us think the problem was
somewhere else it would be really
obvious to you that lawyers are the
problem
and by the way they're not always
breaking the law
uh how about if uh
if uh sidney powell
had not told the trump supporters
that they totally had the goods
do you think the trump supporters would
have been so worked up
if somebody who wasn't a high-end lawyer
somebody you really expect
better know they have the facts before
they talk in public like that
do you think they would have been as
worked up
probably not
this was lawyer problems from top to
bottom
and the fact that we see it any other
way
is a testimony to how easily we can be
brainwashed
because i mean it's only one of the
filters or frames you could put on this
but it's the most productive one
it's just a lawyer on lawyer crime
and we're all we're all
basically we're just victims of the
drive-by shootings by lawyers
and we're acting like it's some other
problem entirely
so
um
so there's that
um what about this
gun control
bill so
a lot of republicans are hopping mad
i guess a number of republicans signed
on to a democrat
gun control bill that includes some red
flag
law funding
so it's funding for states to look into
and or implement red flag laws and that
means that if you think your neighbor or
friend or family member is a little
crazy
you can have the government take their
gun away
because you reported that they were
somehow mentally unstable or dangerous
or something now
as many people have suggested
uh doesn't that mean that everybody's
just going to turn in every republican
that lives next door and and every
democrat who sees a republican who has
more than one gun
is going to say
more than one gun
that's a little crazy to me
why would you need more than one gun
and while you're you take pictures and
put them on social media of you at the
gun range oh that's a little crazy
i think maybe maybe the red flag
is appropriate for you
so
there's definitely a slippery slope
it's not even slippery it's like right
there you don't even have to wait for
the slide do you
literally on day one
your neighbor can turn you in for being
a little too republican with your guns
am i wrong
i i would i would think that being a
little too republican is going to start
looking like a mental disorder
did we not see the uh the mental
disorder
industry
trump in public
when that's the last thing anybody
should do if they're in that business
like the last thing you should do is
diagnose somebody's mental disorder and
they're not even your patient it's just
somebody you see on tv and and these
psychi psychiatric
industry like just completely gave up
their standard because it was trump it's
like oh yeah well in this case we'll do
it yeah normal normally normally we
wouldn't do it but you know trump
so
when you see how flexible
people can be
under the right situation
yeah the i there's a legitimate reason
to be worried about these red flag laws
on the other hand
what do i always say
when there's something that
you don't know if it would work
or not
what do i always say
test it
test it
why are we even arguing
just put it in one damn state
let it run for three years
and see if any republicans get turned in
i think you would know pretty
pretty reliably
if it turns out that democrats are just
going to be turning in republicans
if you think that's the problem
and i think that's an entirely
legitimate
worry
you just don't know if it's true
like you worry because you don't know
right
it could work it could be exactly the
opposite of that
here's the other way it could go
the democrat calls and says i need to
red flag my neighbor
because he's he's like a little too gun
obsessed
but maybe he's just a republican with a
hobby right it doesn't mean anything
about violence
what happens when the police get that
call do they act on it because now
there's a red flag law
or do they say
um
does your does your neighbor have a red
hat that says mega on it
and then the democrat says
yes and then the do the police say oh
we'll put somebody right on it
or the police say
don't worry that's just how they act
i feel like it might be the latter
because the police are just going to
want to use their resources for things
that are useful right
the police do not want to waste their
time
so the counter to the slippery slope
is that the police will hardly ever want
to do anything with the red flag
i think you'd be
i think it would be shockingly difficult
to get the police to act at all
on a red flag complaint
it would have to be pretty damning
for the police act only because the
police have limited resources
so
do you remember i said follow the money
do you know why i always speed
if i happen to be driving at 4 00 a.m on
a sunday morning
well let's say not for him
let's say 8 a.m on a sunday morning do
you know why i always speed
well not only because there's not much
traffic
but because i know the police department
will not implement resources
for a low traffic time of day
follow the money
if you know how money influences how
everybody acts
you'll never get a speeding ticket
i i realize that's a dramatic claim but
let me give you another example do you
ever see those signs that the police
will put up to tell you what your speed
is
and the idea is to tell you that you're
speeding so you'll slow down
do you know what i do when i see that
sign i speed
do you know why
because no police department in the
world is going to put up that sign
to warn you to slow down and then also
assign an officer to give you a ticket
if you didn't follow the sign
the side is what you put there when you
can't afford to put an officer there
all the time
if you don't understand economics
you might think oh there's going to be a
police right after the sign
no
no the the signs instead of the police
somebody says wrong but i bet it's not
wrong often
so the point is
if you understand economics uh you can
anticipate things a little bit better
tim pool was swatted eight times and the
police keep coming yeah that tim pool
thing there's something we need to know
about that
there's something about that story that
doesn't make complete sense
i'm having a little trouble believing he
gets wanted time after time you know and
it's a
fake call and that
the swat falls for it one time after
another
really there's nobody on a swat team
who's heard of tim pool
at this point it'd be hard for me to
imagine
any swat organization
where there isn't at least one person
who knows who the tim poole is and
that he gets swatted
all the time on fake calls
i don't know i'm just not believing
there's something about the story that
doesn't add up
but um i was so i'd say you have two
counterforces that could be tested one
is of course people would abuse the red
flag law of course they would because
we're people
people will use anything
there's nothing that can be introduced
into the world that people won't abuse
so yes
they'll abuse it but will the police
resource constraint
cause the police to be like a really
useful check on this but they won't act
unless it's like really obvious and when
it's really obvious maybe they should
act right
so i'm not sure the only thing i know
for sure is that you could test it in
one state
wait a couple years if it worked
then you don't give up your
constitutional rights without getting
something in return
alex brogan
on twitter
uh did a thread with a bunch of good
ideas about persuasion but there was one
that he had there that i'm going to push
back a little bit on
because i have a counterfeit so here's a
persuasion tip of the day
so what alex wrote was i called it the
rule of three i think this came from
mckinsey or someplace that whenever
you're trying to persuade a person
to do something always present three
reasons
never two never four but exactly three
and the idea is
it gets people's attention and most of
us have been hired wired to expect
things in groups of three
so it's more persuasive
and i can see the argument
that maybe there's some hard wiring that
three reasons
is just the right amount
but i would push back on that because my
experience is
if you give people three reasons
the argument goes like this and see if
this sounds familiar
i'll say well there are three reasons
reason number one
it would kill you
reason number two
it would be expensive
reason number three
it's not even doable it's impractical
now
if you give three reasons
people will you know start arguing with
you know parts of those categories
and you'll never you'll never get them
to nail to agree
because the moment you you argue the
first one and they say no it's not going
to kill you and then you do your
argument and
they agree
or or they don't agree they usually get
to the point where they say
but what about that other one and you're
like wait a minute wait a minute are you
conceding this point
and they'll never concede the point
they'll just move to the other point
then you say okay okay we'll get back to
this one because i think i won this but
you didn't agree so let me let me win
these other two and then you
then you make your great point on the
second one what did they do
they say oh now you've made two good
points let's see about this third one
never
never
they'll just move to the third one and
start arguing why you're wrong about
that one and you'll be like well i'm not
so sure i've
settled the first two
did i
and then you argue the third one and you
make your point and now in your mind
you've said all right three arguments
i've now supported all three arguments
we're done here what does the person who
has now been completely vanquished on
all three points do next you tell me in
your own experience you've gone down the
list of three you've completely
vanquished their points
in ways that they don't even have a
response to they literally don't have a
response to it they just move to the
next what happens next
they return to the first one and start
over that's right
name here that is correct
they start over
and they will pretend
that you had never already countered
their first argument they'll just start
back on the first one
and you'll be you'll you'll think
all right do you have amnesia
we just did this
and they'll act like you hadn't
and so you'll think okay well
i'll do it again
and then you'll do the same three again
and you'll say there if you at least you
remember all three debunks so now we're
done and what will they do
they'll start with the first one again
like it never happened
now you've seen this right i'm not the
only person who's gone through this
you know i call it the the well
you keep going down the well and there's
no bottom
anyway
so i would argue that you should take
their strongest argument and debunk it
and then say
boom
if your strongest argument fell apart
yeah do we we don't really need to talk
about the other ones because i'm not i'm
not going to let you escape to them
because i know you'll escape so the
first thing you want to do
is destroy their escape paths
right now you have to be a deadly
debater to do this but
if you're sure you're going to win on
the strongest point
make sure you've you know eliminated all
their escape paths before you annihilate
their first one
by getting them to agree
how about i just take your strongest
point
and if i if i can debunk your strongest
point would you agree
to maybe rethink your the rest of it
we don't have to do it today but just
your strongest point
because if you do that that that gets
rid of their escape has you say yeah
yeah yeah but i just today let's we'll
just talk about the strongest point and
now that you see you were wrong about
that
maybe you should do a little research
that's about as far as you can go people
can talk themselves into things better
than you can talk them into it so if you
sort of point them in the right
direction sometimes they'll walk there
on their own
all right
i believe i feel like there was at least
one thing that i didn't mention today
looking at my notes looking at my notes
nope
that was it
i guess this is
complete
i believe that once again your lives
have been improved by the time that we
spent here together
um
and
how many of you just got smarter
three three of you but i'll get the rest
of you next time
i can't win them all
desantis is pushing back on baby
vaccines
yeah i've heard some weird things on the
baby vaccine story
like the weirdest one was i can't
believe this is right
like there there's something about
the vaccine companies don't have
liability unless it includes kids
unless kids are part of the program or
something did somebody hear that
like that doesn't sound right
i mean
that that doesn't sound true i mean just
on the surface that doesn't sound true
scott stop with the self-importance
i've been advised to stop with my
self-importance
michael i'm going to hide you on this
channel because you're less important
than me
goodbye
i would advise all of you
to ramp up your self-importance
anybody who advises you to think of
yourself as less important
you really need to remove them from your
life immediately
immediately remove them for your life
so
if you'd like to talk to me about how
i'm feeling too good about my abilities
that's great just don't do it around me
i just don't have any interest in you
and i would advise you
to maybe
think better of yourself
i don't know which would make you
happier i'm no doctor
but i'll bet you
that if you learn to think well of
yourself you'll be happier
i think
i think
did i miss uh jordan peterson tweet
discussion oh is there a spicy jordan
peterson tweet
that i missed
can somebody fill me in what did jordan
peterson say that
oh he did he say that
all right
we'll see if there's a jordan peterson
thing i need to respond to
uh ask schallenberger about biden's oil
lies yeah michael schellenberger does
the best job of
putting things in context especially for
energy questions and homeless stuff
but yeah he's been calling out biden for
for his claims about uh refineries
so was there a jordan peterson tweet
the one with gad's ad should i look it
up it's like you're not gonna tell me
well maybe i'll do that for tomorrow i
won't keep you all right that's all for
today
i will talk to you tomorrow and
i'm hoping that all of you have an
amazing
peterson said you weren't important
what's that say
peterson said you weren't important or
that people weren't important
is that what he said
all right well we'll figure out what he
said
and on that note i'm apparently babbling
even though
this is still
the best experience that most of you
have ever had in your life
and some of you
are going to have an even better
experience later today
i don't know who you are
but probably probably
because that's how it works
um
yes an amazing day coming and i'll talk
to you tomorrow youtube bye for now
