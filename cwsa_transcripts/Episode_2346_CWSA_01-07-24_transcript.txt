good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams is the highlight
of human civilization and if you uh
would like to take this experience up to
levels which I don't know I don't think
any of us could even imagine all you
need for that is a cuper marara glass a
tankered shell orstein a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure it's the dope of me
end of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous step in happens
now
ah that was glorious really I almost
feel like I need another one
anybody double sip double sip
go
yeah I needed that I could not go on
without that extra caffine but now we're
ready for the best show that's ever
been um would anybody like to uh give me
a hearty thank you for making the trend
for making the term dementia Hitler
trend for 48 hours on X
anybody would anybody like to thank me
for that yeah I I did
that you know what's funny the uh
dementia
Hitler um you never know what's going to
catch
on it's the first time I tried to make
something catchy but it doesn't always
work and I don't always know why it
doesn't work but sometimes you know it
does and sometimes it doesn't so I was
just looking at uh Biden giving his
speech and the term just popped into my
head just fully formed I just saw
dementia Hiller
so I wrote it down and when I wrote it
down I said to myself that's kind of
sticky but I had no idea that it would
be trending for two days so
far uh my goal is to get Trump to use
the phrase dementi
Hitler I don't think he will because
it's not his own uh but we'll
see so I wonder uh you know after a big
speech like uh like Joe Biden did on
January 6 do you think that afterwards
he talks to his staff and says hey how
how did it how'd it go how do you think
I did and they're like
well well you know you're fine fine I
know but what's the feedback you know
what what is social media saying about
my speech well well many of your
supporters liked it a lot okay I know
the supporters are going to like it but
what about the you know the other people
well
you're trending on X excellent excellent
that's what I was hoping for what's it
say well what's trending is the phrase
dementia
Hitler so that's how your speech
went there you go all right uh in other
news Microsoft and open AI are being
sued by some uh some authors of
nonfiction
books and the idea is that uh the AI is
scraping their work and it's getting it
in some way that they say is a violation
of
copyright now I've heard that the
fiction writers separately were trying
to do something legally as well but I
don't really understand why that makes
sense if you if you write a work of
fiction isn't the value of the book the
exact wording and your phrases and your
sentences it's not like AI is going to
reproduce that I mean it might do a
sentence or something as a quote but
it's not going to reproduce the book for
free and I can't really summarize it
because a summary of a fiction book is
nothing you know summarize uh Romeo and
Juliet well two lovers you know they had
trouble getting together their families
didn't like each other ended up
committing
suicide fiction fiction by its design
can't be summarized so I'm not exactly
sure what the fiction writers have to
worry to worry about with AI but I'll
tell you the non-fiction writers have a
lot to worry and I'm one of those so in
addition to gilbery Jokes which would be
fiction uh my latest books are all
non-fiction reframe your brain the book
that is changing lives all over the
world right now is non-fiction
now I'm going to tell you something that
I probably shouldn't tell
you you could get a summary of most
books just by asking
AI it'll tell you the basic idea and the
thing that I shouldn't tell you as a
fiction writer I'm I'm kind of being
disloyal to my
people is that most non-fiction books
can be summarized just
fine most non-fiction books can be
summarized by a I just fine in fact I
use chat gbt in um in voice mode where
you can just talk to it anytime you want
you don't have to use any wake up uh you
don't have to use any wakeup terms you
just start talking you can have a
conversation with it not anything so the
other day I was driving listening to my
Ai and there was a a book I'm not going
to mention the book because I think it
would be unfair in this context but
there's a very well-known Business book
that I had not read but I felt bad
because I should you know there there's
some books you kind of have to read to
be considered up to date on what's going
on and I said to myself well AI can you
summarize that book and it did and I
went away feeling that I didn't really
need to see
anymore the
summary was
sufficient you know I ask questions
which is the way I like to learn I like
to get the general idea of something and
then ask a question it's like well does
that include this and how do you define
that and you that sort of thing so I had
some questions but basically I saved
myself four hours of reading a
book and I don't think I lost anything I
feel like I got exactly everything I
needed from a
summary now can you do that to my books
that would be your next question right
can AI summ my books because they're
also non-fiction it's factual stuff and
the answer is
no you can't summarize them and the
reason you can't summarize mine is that
I write it with persuasion techniques
which if you take the persuasion out you
would have a description of tools that
nobody would
use let me say it again when I write a
book of fiction it's usually stuff that
um I think would make your life better
but only if you do it only if you do it
reading about it isn't going to do
anything for you so I combine in my
non-fiction books the type of text that
would persuade you to maybe try it if
you if you summarize my book you would
take the persuasion out you say well he
says do this and this and that you
wouldn't do it you absolutely would not
do it because you heard a summary so if
you summarize my book you lose most of
the value because' be a bunch of stuff
you don't
try now there are two ways to convince
people to do stuff one is to show them
some science which sometimes can
convince people I use I use more um
story form because stories are more
persuasive so if I say I had this
experience and I know three people that
had this experience you're probably more
persuaded than if I said there was a
metaanalysis of something that you
didn't trust anyway so don't take the
persuasion out but uh these authors are
suing open Ai and they're asking for
$150,000 a piece for what all all
fiction non-fiction authors that become
part of it I know does that sound fair
do you think chat GPT should be allowed
to essentially steal and summarize your
book if they give you
$150,000
once what's that's probably 99% of
writers would say that was the best deal
they ever saw in their life and 1% would
say that's way less than my book is
worth I don't know we'll find out what
the courts say about
this well there's a big problem with
insuring homes if you didn't know uh
some of it seems to be getting blamed on
climate
change which I believe is bullsh
but there are other reasons as well one
reason is people keep building in
dangerous
places so the more expensive homes you
build on the coast of Florida the more
it's going to cost you for insurance in
California our version of that is uh if
you build your expensive new
mcmansion in an area that's close to a
forest that's poorly
managed your house might burn up and
your insurance company knows that now so
they're not going to give you insurance
they're going to say nope we don't want
to take a risk of insuring your $3
million mcmansion next to this Forest
that'll probably burn down in the next
five years so it's a real big problem if
you can't get insurance the entire
Housing Industry
dies and if you if you have to pay so
much for it the the rates are going up
as much as
50% since the last few years your home
insurance is up about
50% which is something that every voter
with a home is going to notice if they
haven't insured they're definitely going
to notice
that so we'll keep an eye on that um but
here's what I think will
happen I think that the market will
adjust because our markets are flexible
enough that somebody's going to figure
out how to build a home that doesn't get
destroyed by
Hurricane right that's all it would take
you just just have to build a home that
won't burn down and won't be destroyed
by a
hurricane which can be done can be done
so you just need more of those I
think
um
yeah anyway
so uh where are people moving to so this
is an interesting article in the New
York Post I was kind of interested you
always hear about California and Florida
and Texas but apparently the places
people are moving to most are Vermont
and South
Carolina did you know that that the
states with the most incoming are
Vermont and South
Carolina Bernie Sanders is is a little
Vermont is very popular now I feel like
the Vermont people are some of them are
you know just going for a simpler
lifestyle and they like like the scenery
and stuff but don't you think a lot of
the people moving to
Vermont are saying get me out of the
city doesn't it feel like people are
escaping for their own safety at least
to some extent and maybe lower cost of
living as well I couldn't put up in the
snow but South Carolina is the other
place what do Vermont and South Carolina
have in
common anybody what do Vermont and South
Carolina have in
common maybe nothing lower lower cost of
living maybe a lower cost of living and
um I hear South Carolina is really
beautiful isn't there the most livable
city in the country is in South Carolina
or is it North Carolina is it Greenville
or something where's Greenville South
Carolina or
North all right so wherever that is um
and the people are moving away from
California New Jersey Illinois and
Michigan did you know that you probably
knew about California but did you know
people are moving out of New Jersey
Illinois and Michigan I wonder if those
are all high tax
states does anybody
know uh Greenville is in both oh so
there's a Greenville in both North and
South Carolina but I'm told the good one
is in South
Carolina the good one how would you like
to be the bad
Greenville it's probably pretty good too
but there's one that's better all right
um there's a big story in the Wall
Street Journal about how investors and
people are worried about Elon musk's
illegal drug
use now before I tell you this whole
story about people all upset about Elon
Musk illegal drug use here's what you
need to know
um three years ago after this is what
musk himself says on on acts he said
after one puff with Rogan meaning one
puff of marijuana I agreed at NASA's
request to do three years of random drug
testing not even Trace quantities were
found of any drug or
alcohol or
alcohol nothing in three years so three
years of total
cleanness and and the and the Wall
Street Journal writes a long article
about everybody's worried about his drug
use is going to ruin
everything now what would you call
that is that
news does that look like a valuable news
that you need to
know no this is clearly a hitpiece from
The Wall Street Journal now I do expect
more from The Wall Street Journal I have
to admit I I expect better better than
this I think the Wall Street Journal is
typically much better than this this is
Despicable it's despicable now I think
musk does um you know everything that
needs to be done to debunk it just by
saying that he's been tested for three
years and he doesn't have even Trace
quantities including
alcohol now Does Elon Musk not
drink is that a thing does anybody
know because I'd be very impressed if
that's the case does he not even have a
casual
drink and the reason I ask is because
there are a lot of very influential
people more of them I see in the
political right who have stopped
drinking and they like to let you know
publicly I'm I'm one of those people and
it feels like that trend is really
increasing have you seen it as well the
the number of public figures who say
they don't drink anything you know such
as
me yeah um anyway I'd love to know if he
is just off of alcohol or or they didn't
find any because it doesn't stay in your
system that long I don't know which one
it
is um but here's the thing you need to
know so I added this to the
argument
and um this is one of the things I can
say because I'm canceled and
disgraced so this free speech stuff is
just
terrific I got to tell you my enjoyment
of social media and just being able to
talk in public in general is about 120%
better than it was last year because
here's a topic that I can tell you
without any
hesitation that I don't know if I would
have done even a year ago and it goes
like this I'm going to tell you a big
secret of silic Valley and perhaps
American industry in general but I know
less about that and it's
this in in the normal
World both the successful people and the
unsuccessful people are doing a lot of
drugs including alcohol and
tobacco a lot of drugs but what's the
difference between the super successful
people and the people become addicts and
Street people and you know they lose
their jobs and their family and
everything what's the difference well
nobody's going to tell you this except
me because you just aren't allowed to
say this out loud I'm going to tell you
something out loud that I believe is
known to everybody in Silicon Valley but
you've never seen an article on it or at
least I haven't maybe somebody has
written one it goes like
this it is inaccurate and maybe
misleading to say there's people on
drugs and then people not on drugs and
that the people not on drugs are
operating efficiently and getting stuff
done and the people on drugs are all a
mess in a general way I would agree you
should stay off drugs in a general way
it's better not to do any in in just
sort of a overall General way however we
live in a world where no two people are
the
same uh your reaction to a drink of
alcohol might be completely different
than someone else's and the same goes
for the other drugs but more to the
point beyond the individual differences
is that the drugs that people choose
have very different
characteristics there are drugs which
primarily if used correctly can enhance
your
performance that are illegal there are
drugs which if used even correctly will
do deg grade your performance and
there's no way around it right if you're
taking a too much clopin or you're
drinking or
your probably heroin or something not
going to
help that that's not making you able to
make rocket ships if you're shooting
fentel in your arm you're not making car
companies and Rocket companies right
that's the wrong choice of drug if
you're drinking all day long sometimes
you could be a functional alcoholic
there are lots of them but it's probably
not helping you it may be something
you're managing it's not making you
better at your
job however there are a number of drugs
and most of them were named when in the
Wall Street Journal article that are
closer to Performance
enhancers than performance
herters one of them that's closer to an
enhancer is mushrooms and LSD and
psychedelics in general now I want to be
really as precise as I can about this
for some number of people doing
hallucinogenics could be
terrible could be you could overdo it
you could I I I imagine there's all
kinds of risks so I don't recommend it
and in general I'm not going to
recommend that anybody do any of the
drugs that I'm about to mention don't
drink alcohol don't smoke cigarettes
don't do weed even if I say I do don't
do it because I'm not a doctor and I do
it for medicinal
purposes um but it must be
said that a lot of the greatest
accomplishments probably depended on
psychedelics yeah I'm I'm going to say
this as you know as firmly as possible
probably a lot of the biggest
accomplishments in American Tech were
from people who were on the right kind
of drugs and in the right way meaning
that the psychedelics may have cured
their mental illness so that they could
go on to better performance it may have
made them more
open-minded it may have simply made
their life better so that they could put
more Gusto into what they're doing now
and again I I'll keep repeating myself
because I don't want to make I want to
make sure I'm not confusing anybody
all of the drugs I mentioned could be
devastating to a person's life and I
don't recommend them at all period I
don't recommend
them but it is nonetheless true that
some number of the greatest
accomplishments in the world probably
not probably certainly came from people
who had enhanced their abilities through
some illegal
drugs suppose you knew that somebody was
capable of doing great things if only
they could beat their
depression and then they took camine
camine camine I I always read it but I
never hear it ketamine or
ketamine it's one of those and suppose
you took that and suppose you did it
responsibly and it helped you with your
mental
health well that frees you now you can
go do those things but if you're just
you know tortured by your mental health
and you don't know what to do about it
you've tried all the normal things
therapy didn't work and you know
whatever maybe maybe and again I'm not
recommending this so if you have a
mental health problem don't go take a
bunch of ketamine because you heard it
on a live stream be responsible don't
take
drugs I'm just saying that in the right
situation the a smart person can enhance
their capabilities
substantially and I won't go through all
the other drugs and say how it could be
misused but how somebody might use it
correctly I'm just saying if you're
doing downers that are making you sleepy
and stupid it's not helping you but if
you're doing things that expand your
mind don't have a lot of downside
something that helps your mental
health um something that makes you more
creative more energized more
interested could actually help
now when I saw that uh Wall Street
Journal said the Elon Musk has done
these following
drugs that Reports say of various
parties or something obviously not in
the last three years but in some
sometime in the past I say to myself can
I get a
list can I get a list of those drugs
because whatever he's doing is
working all is somebody
suggesting that if he had not done those
few party drugs that were me men you
know they were in the context of a party
and somebody suggested that if he hadn't
done
it that uh the SpaceX would be doing
much
better would he be selling more Tesla
cars if he had not smoked a joint with
Joe
Rogan I mean put any of this together
for me none of it makes sense it only
makes sense that the Wall Street Journal
is writing a
hippies all right moving on uh
University
Utah uh is removing any Dei questions
and statements because the the
government of Utah said to and they're
just getting out of the Dei business
apparently in University of
Utah
so let me ask you this is the trend for
Dei uh certainly for less of it or do
you think it's still
expanding do you think there's more of
it or less of it in the coming years
year I think it might be
bifurcated I I think there might be some
you know really blue places that get
more of it but the red states are
definitely getting rid of it now what do
you make of the fact that there's uh a
thing that some states think is so
dangerous it's illegal and other states
say oh we need more of
this it's almost like some states are
passing a law that says you have to eat
sugar and other states are passing laws
that says stay away from sugar it's bad
for you and they both exist at the same
time now I like the fact that our 50
states could be like the Laboratories
for the
Republic but that doesn't make any sense
if if there's a substantial number of
states who say doing this is actually
bad for you while other states are
saying is good for you and really really
good for you I think we ought to maybe
come together and have a convention and
hash that out maybe maybe that's not
something we should compete
on well Trump makes news
again for allegedly mocking John
McCain's uh uh injuries from the
War uh when he was talking about
Obamacare vote and how John McCain
surprised people by get you know giving
the thumbs down uh Trump said John
McCain for some reason couldn't get his
arm up that
day I remember a time when this would be
big
news and everybody would be shocked and
offended it doesn't feel like that
anymore does
it because once you know Trump's
act you just know he says outrageous
things about his critics and you just go
oh it's just part of the
show I mean he I think he's passed into
Don Rickles
territory I was hearing yesterday yet
another story about now deceased
comedian Don Rickles whose entire show
was about insulting people in the
audience and famous people he would just
insult people now if you were just walk
up somebody and insult them they would
be quite mad but if your brand becomes
the I'm the insult person you become Don
reckles then you can say anything
because people say oh I it's just part
of the show I I think
Trump has sort of uh drifted into the
Don
Rickles frame where he can just say this
you know about John McCain's War injury
and people just shrug it
off I don't think it's going to be a
headline well it's a headline I don't
think anybody cares I think it will
change Zero
votes because it's McCain right Trump is
really good about not going after
innocent citizens and voters who are
minding their own business as opposed to
dementia Hitler who wants you to know
that magga people are definitely bad to
the core right Trump doesn't do that and
compare these two things Trump mocking
the war injuries of one character who
many people in the country who agree
with Trump think is Despicable and has
gotten us into I know Wars we didn't
need to be in and
whatnot
um compare that to Biden giving a speech
saying that the magga people are
insurrectionists
supporters which one's worse I would say
dementia Hitler is way worse now on an
individual level Trump was worse but
it's worse against a
Critic I don't know saying bad things
about a Critic is just sort of business
as usual
but saying bad things about your public
if you're the president is really really
really bad I'm I don't approve of either
one just you know if you're saying why
are you approving of trump making fun of
somebody's disability I'm not approving
it I'm just saying I understand it as
part of the show so it doesn't bother me
in any way
whatsoever so here's my theme for today
uh everything's correct corupt and it's
obvious everything's corrupt and it's
obvious so the in the following stories
you can see that theme so I was reading
uh the publication the hill and I
noticed that they use uh Insurrection
when talking about January 6 as though
it's a proven fact in other words they
don't soften it by saying some call it
an
Insurrection you know some have called
some have branded it what they don't say
is that no core has found it was an
Insurrection which is true no core has
but they don't say that they just write
an article and they
say uh the Insurrection brought an
overwhelming bipartisan disapproval from
Americans just the
Insurrection not the protest that some
people said was an
Insurrection but the
Insurrection now I ask you is this a
sign that the
Press uh is clearly corrupt I think so
for the press to write Insurrection when
clearly the evidence is 100% against it
and then just to treat it like it's such
a fact that you don't even need to
explain it or put any caveats you don't
need to put it in quotes it's just a
fact
now now how is that
different from Trump saying that the
2020 election was
rigged what did people say when Trump
says 2020 was rigged
everybody everybody said no court showed
it was rigged no court showed it was
rigged guess what no court has shown it
was an
Insurrection not at least he's not been
accused of insurrection there was a
court that just sort of said there was
an Insurrection but there hasn't been a
trial on the question of whether it was
an Insurrection so why is it that um a
trial is necessary when you're saying
the the election was
you can't say that unless it was a trial
but you can say it was an Insurrection
when there's no court finding of the of
anything of the sort that's corruption
so this is a corrupt publication in my
opinion how bad was the Insurrection
well on the same day yesterday that an
MSNBC host cried on the air when hearing
how horrible January 6 was that's right
he had to take out tissue cuz he was
crying on the air about all the violence
and terribleness of the day at the same
time I'm reading a post from uh the blue
color intellectual podcast Julian is his
name and he posted this happy j6 to
everyone losing their minds I've had sex
more violent than this
Insurrection yall are ridiculous for
trying to take Trump the ballot for
this I've had sex more violent than this
Insurrection now that's one of the
funniest things I've heard
about I've had sex more violent than
this
Insurrection now that's some good
mocking now I've told you you you need
to you need to mock this the January 6
thing should be not denied just mocked
because it's so stupid this is
some good mockery I've had more I've had
sex more
violent well the hill who we've already
determined as a piece of uh is also
reporting that the uh triple demic is
surging and there are fears of
it are yall worried about the triple
demic is there even one person here
who's all worried about the triple demic
you know the flu and the co and I don't
know what the third thing
you're all worried right oh we're so
worried I'm so worried
I I changed all of my all of my life
over it nope didn't do anything
differently I didn't do anything
differently did you I can't think of
anything I did differently because there
was a triple demic oh but they got a
word for it it's a triple demic now do
you think that the hill wrote this
article because this is newsworthy and
interesting or because there has a
political Dimension to
it well I don't know makes you wonder if
they hadn't called it an Insurrection I
might have given them the benefit of a
doubt but when you do something that's
clearly biased and
political then I say maybe I can extend
that to your other coverage wouldn't
that be
fair well let's talk about President
Biden and his uh dementia h tple
hoax um he said that three years ago a
violent mob fueled by lies attacked the
US capital our democracy was tested but
it held because we the people
prevailed now what I see is a
hitler-like anti-democratic guy who's
keeping his trying to keep his opponent
off the ballot trying to where his party
is uh doing massive work to decrease
freed
speech and to jail their
opponents dementia
Hiller and he has the nerve to not only
promote this hoax for his presidency but
uh he says it uh the Republic held
because we the people
prevailed I'm pretty sure that we the
people were the
protesters well let's get that straight
we the
people was the protesters
we not the people was the government
they were
protesting because they're not the
people I mean that's basically the the
protest is that the government was not
you know being responsive to the people
so no we the people is who who the
protesters were let's get that part
straight so yes uh we do have a dementia
president and his 10 pole hoax is going
to be January 6 so they're now firmly in
the narrow ravine
and uh let your mockery cannons
go um Jonathan Turley points out that
over half of the states are calling on
the courts to reject Trump's
disqualification to be on the
ballot so more than half of the states
are saying it you know it should be
illegal or at least unwise to keep him
off the B the
ballot which means that over half of
Americans oppose this effort to keep him
off but does dementia Hitler care no
dementia Hitler is going to do something
that more than half of the public
doesn't
want um oh we got we had the 34 Minute
glitch again still don't know what that
is so yeah that's a pretty big sign of
corruption trying to keep your opponent
off how about that pipe bomber story you
remember that the January 6 pipe bomber
it's a good good thing we now have all
the information about that isn't it to
which you're saying what I don't know
about that story or I forget about it
well the ramaswami reminds us in truth
number nine part of his series he says
pipe bombs were placed near the DNC and
RNC headquarters on January 5th in
2021 with many irregularities including
KL Harris showing up at the DNC
headquarters on the morning of January 6
without secret Serv or any law
enforcement spotting the pipe
bombs so that's a big question why
wouldn't they spot them because
apparently they weren't well hidden they
were not well hidden only for both pipe
bombs to be found later on January 6th H
yeah strangely the government still
hasn't set a peep about the burp despite
available surveillance footage of the
pipe bomber which has not been fully
released why not a CBS reporter recently
exposed the doj's notable silence on his
investigation what really happened yes
does this sound like oh just some little
mystery criminal thing or does it sound
like the government is covering up
something that looks like an
OP it looks corrupt it looks like the
government's covering something up I
don't know for sure but in the context
of all the other
 it's reasonable to assume what
is assuming that there's something here
because of the lack of transparency a
lack of transparency from a government
entity allows you to assume
guilt which you should not assume for a
human like an individual citizen assume
innocence for people assume guilt for
your non-transparent
government Mike cernovich posted this
asking is America the only country where
you don't know election results for
weeks and are assured this is normal and
not corrupt at
all
what what if it's as obvious as it looks
why are we the only country that can't
count our votes the same day I can only
think of one
reason and it's not incompetence because
incompetence has largely been driven out
of the system by doing the same election
year after year after year with people
who know what they're doing so I don't
think it's
incompetence it has to be
planned it has to be designed that way
otherwise you don't get it because you
could design it out easily other
countries do it easily it's not even a
challenge really there's no challenge to
it we just don't do it and and everybody
in the country Democrat independent
Republicans everybody knows that your
credibility of your system degrades with
every hour you delay the final count
everybody knows that it's just obvious
common sense so if it's obvious it's a
terrible terrible terrible thing for the
Republic why don't we fix
it there's only one reason
corruption I can't think of a second
reason like even if you assume that the
country has become terribly
incompetent they would at least be
trying am I right even if you assume
incompetence is the problem they would
at least be conspicuously trying to fix
it but that's not happening is it I know
maybe in some states they may have
tweaked some things but uh if it happens
again if this election is another one
where we don't know the results for days
you have to assume it's rigged you just
have
to why else
right uh California has uh declared that
the state health insurance will cover
sex change operations for illegal
immigrants so not only can you come to
America America and get Healthcare but
they will change your gender if you ask
now I just think that that's so
close to a perfect
law but you know some things you know
close only counts in Horseshoes and Hand
Grenades you know they say being close
is still a fail and when I say it's
close to being a perfect policy instead
of covering sex change for illegal
immigrants I would make just the small
tweak to this just smallest tweak I keep
it just the way it is with the smallest
little adjustment I'd make it
mandatory yeah that's how I'd play it
you'd end immigration in about 10
minutes you may come into the country
under Asylum we'll be altering your
gender and it's
mandatory just make it mandatory we can
solve this whole this whole thing and
and you know the best part is you
wouldn't really have to surgically alter
all of them you could do three or four
and you would end the entire immigration
problem am I right because I think
people notice a pattern it's like wait
how many three we're just getting
started okay I'm
out three would be enough three would be
enough no I'm just kidding I'm joking
don't get too
serious uh speaking of CET she also had
a good point about how the uh Congress
members are
underpaid relative to what we're asking
them to do so
$174,000 a year uh to live away from
your family and have like separate
quarters so you're supporting your
family back where your family is but you
also have to support yourself in a at
least a life style that makes it seem
credible that you're an elected official
in DC which is really expensive and
174,000 a year sounds like a lot to a
lot of people but it's not really a lot
in that context because you'd have two
homes now Joshua lysc added to
that famous Ghost Writer Joshua lysac
and uh I'll read what he said he said
Congressional salaries need to be in the
millions of dollars or
zero it needs to be millions of dollars
a pay or zero and here's the argument a
lukewarm 174,000 per year means you need
to earn your fortune through other means
in
DC and you need leadership or
financially independent and free now
does that does that strike a
cord it really does doesn't it because
if you tell me that you put all these
people who have let's say they're
aggressive enough that they can run for
office and win so you're you're a
certain type of alpha aggressive
character and then we guarantee that you
can't make enough money to live in
Comfort what are you going to
do it's almost like we're begging them
to steal from us you're begging them to
steal from the public because if they
don't they're doing more work than
they're getting paid
for that's what makes people deal they
think that their situation is not fair
so I can imagine you could justify it
very easily as in well you know I really
couldn't stay in this job and I'm
helping people so much in my district
and I really am one of the good guys so
if I allow this project to go forward
and I vote for it
uh it's a good project anyway hey yeah
maybe I was bribed to support it but you
know what I would have supported it
anyway so you can see how easily
somebody can talk themselves into taking
a bribe without calling it a bribe all
right so we put these people in the
situation which as uh Joshua lysac
points out we've designed a system for
corruption not to prevent
it remember design is Destiny you can
look at the design of a thing and
determine how it'll go
so if I said to you the government
doesn't exist I'm going to design one on
paper and I'm going to have these
Congress people get elected they have to
live in DC away from their families with
twice the expense and we're going to pay
them just enough to get by just
enough what would you say is the likely
outcome of that system by
design that would be a system designed
to guarantee corruption and it looks
like that's what we got do you know how
I know because it's designed to
guarantee
corruption do you do you know why I
think the election is almost certainly
rigged or or there's an attempt to rig
it whether they do it or not is because
their elections are designed to make it
hard to audit them by Design it's not an
accident you could very easily make a
fully auditable system just put it all
on paper and have people count it twice
Am I Wrong put it all on paper and then
an audit is you count it
twice that's that's about it so it's
easy to design a system that has no
corruption or would be hard to have it
but we didn't do it what is a logical
assumption it's designed to be corrupt
and moreover you have to assume that
both Democrats and Republicans are okay
with it because I don't see a lot of
work going on to fix it you have to
assume both sides are in on
it not every person but certainly
powerful people on both
sides well uh representative Klay
Higgins who now we know is
underpaid uh was on Tucker show and uh
he says he's got more information than
we do about what happened on January 6
and of course we were reminded in that
episode that Christopher Ray the head of
the FBI would not answer the question of
how many FBI undercover agents were
dressed like Trump supporters and
attended January 6 now what do you
assume when they ended the FBI won't
answer the question of whether there
were any and how
many you have to assume that that the
answer to that question would be
embarrassing to the
FBI what would be an embarrassing number
that they didn't have enough well it
could maybe yeah it's possible he's
worried they didn't have enough
undercover agents but the other
possibility seems far more likely is
that they had a lot or what we would
think would be a lot whatever whatever
number that is to you and so it's easier
for or safer not to mention it now to
me when you add that to uh what Higgins
says is a lot of uh evidence that uh
entrapment was
the was the entire process there there's
audio of Nancy
Pelosi uh being happy during January 6
as it was happening because she heard
that the trespassers were on the capital
grounds and then she realized that you
could put them in jail now because they
they they've gone into this federal
offense trespassing and she seemed
pretty happy about it she seemed
happy that she could put the protesters
in jail for that yeah so I will say that
based on what I've seen so far
I think the working assumption is that
it was a government
op doesn't mean I know that doesn't mean
it's proven but the government is guilty
until proven innocent and they've made a
very big show of not wanting to be
transparent if you suspect your
government could have done something and
their response is to give you no
transparency the working assumption is
that you've proven their guilt it
doesn't have to be true
in the same way that you say about a
citizen innocent to proen guilty that
doesn't mean they're innocent that just
means that's the standard and that if
you've got a good standard you're better
off than if you don't have a standard
the standard for the government is if
you suspect they did something bad and
they put up all the walls and bar you
from finding out for sure you have to
assume it's true and you should do all
of your
actions your words and all of your
decisions based on that working
assumption that it was uh it was an op
on January 6 doesn't mean it is likewise
with the
election I have no proof of any rigging
personally I don't have proof and I
don't know how I ever would but the fact
that I can't get it one way or the other
my working assumption is is rigged and
that it will be rigged again that's my
working assumption doesn't mean it's
true
uh V ramaswami he actually called that
January 6 entrapment day hash entrapment
day and he gives you this uh evidence he
says the Capitol Police fired Rubble
bullets and stun grenades into a
peaceful crowd yet later willingly
allowed members of that crowd to enter
the US capital building only to be later
Tracked Down arrested and imprisoned now
I think you could have some debate about
whether that crowd was
peaceful would you agree you could
debate that because there were certainly
violent members of it but what I would
not debate is that the rubber bullets
and stun grenades appeared to be aimed
into the middle of
the nonviolent group am I right if they
if the only people that were rubber
bulleting uh and stun grenading were the
people in the front who were breaking
windows and and trying to beat to death
Capital place
then I would say oh that's a good use of
a rubber bullet and a stun
grenade but why should you assume about
the fact that the this was done into the
center of the peaceful part of the crowd
and then they opened the doors now it
doesn't mean that the people opening
doors had any communication with the
people who fired the rubber bullets and
the stun grades might have been
different people different you know just
making their own decisions what they
thought was would work
best
but if you can't prove it one way or
another and it looks very suspicious as
it vague points out it smells bad right
the video is really damning about why
they would do that now it could be as
simple as incompetence could be that
whoever fired the bullets in the stun
grenades was just bad at their job and
made a bad decision that would be the
most ordinary explanation
but the fact that we can't
know like what was behind that your
working
assumption should
be that is what it looks like it looks
like they were trying to cause more
trouble than they were trying to solve
that's what it looks like can I prove
that do I know what they're thinking can
I read their minds no no can't prove it
can't read their minds and if this were
just about individuals I would say Well
they're innocent to proing guilty you
better bring me some proof but we're
talking about the government and the
government is guilty unless they can
prove it with
transparency all right um this story is
wacky uh so for a few days for four days
uh
the the Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin was hospitalized in intensive
care and the president of the United
States was unaware of
it
but don't worry because his number two
was in charge in running
things from her vacation in Puerto
Rico that's right for four days the
United States did not have a military
defense or at least one not one that is
working the way we wanted to so the
person in charge wasn't even basically
wasn't operational and the person second
in charge was on vacation
now I suppose if something bad happened
she would immediately come back from
vacation but do you feel comfortable
with that keep in mind that the person
who was second in line also did not
inform the president that he didn't have
a real Secretary of
Defense now correct me if I'm
wrong wouldn't you get fired for
this if if if I were the Secretary of
Defense and I did this would I not get
fired I think obviously I
would obviously I would like really
obviously like there's no this one's
this one's black and white but how about
if you were the number two the deputy
secretary who was in charge uh but on
vacation in Puerto Rico and you also
didn't tell your president that he
didn't have a you know an secretary of
state was our secretary of defense who
was on in the country shouldn't you be
fired for
that I think so how about for not
immediately canceling your vacation when
you found out that your boss is
incapacitated I think you should be
fired for that or at least again not
mentioning it to your boss the
president well here's what I think um
the deputy secretary of defense Kathleen
Hicks is a woman and the Secretary of
defense Lloyd Austin is a black man I
think the first black secretary defense
do you
think that they will be fired for what
is obviously a firing
offense I'm going to say no and I'm
going to say this is what the anti- Dei
people have been warning everybody
about you can't fire some people it's
just really really hard to fire people
who have been hired for their diversity
now does that mean that these two people
are not capable of doing their jobs I'm
not saying that I'm saying there's a
specific thing they did that no matter
what your general capability was or no
matter what you did up to that point
it's a pretty obvious firing
offense but I don't think it'll happen
now you could argue Scott you don't know
the details and if you did maybe you
change your mind and you're right if I
knew the details I might change my mind
but here's the
problem our leaders especially our
military leaders they need to inspire
confidence that's a real key part of
their job Inspire confidence did this
Inspire confidence no did the opposite
and I'm pretty sure that they can't be
fired
because one's a woman one's a black man
and I don't think we can fire them in
today's
environment so well they're leaders in
the military sense
um and then Jack bobic reports says
here's what really happened the White
House senior staff knew Austin was in
the ICU but hit it from Biden oh that's
worse I was saying that they didn't tell
the president but they knew the senior
staff knew okay so if the senior staff
knew does that put uh the Secretary of
Defense and the deputy does that put
them in the clear because I would
suggest they did try to tell the boss
but the staff didn't tell
them I'm going to say that doesn't put
them in the
clear I mean it's a good it's a good
defense but if you're the Secretary of
Defense do you hope somebody tells the
president or do you make sure you talk
to
him why in the world would you not have
at least a 10-second conversation with
the president if you were going to leave
the country
undefended you maybe you didn't know the
hospitalization would be that bad there
could be lots of you know extending
circumstances could
be all right let me catch up my comments
here the comments don't scroll on uh
this platform you have to scroll
them all
right yeah so in the in the age of
Dei you have to ask a lot of questions
first of all the White House senior
staff uh how many of them are Dei hires
but they hit it from
Biden
and uh it's going to be a problem and
Biden was living for the White House
staffers do you think Biden should be
living about
that
yes yes even dementia Hitler should be
living about that absolutely livid do
you think he should here's here's let
let me make this standard if he doesn't
fire the Secretary of Defense and
possibly the
deputy if he doesn't he's got to fire
his
staff because if his staff is really the
problem and it might have been so may
maybe uh maybe the Secretary of Def
defense and the deputy are both in the
clear it's possible um but if they talk
to the staff do you think Biden would
have said well let me ask you this do
you think Biden would have said you know
what
uh you you stay on your vacation in
Puerto Rico and I'm sure everything will
be fine because we have telephones and
we'll we'll call you if we need you I
don't know he might have said that's a
bad look you better get back here right
away he might have I think I would have
if I had been the
president um so yeah you should be
pretty livid about
that what else is
happening um
so the daily wire is reporting that a
metaanalysis has been
completed uh on the question of whether
minorities in this country are
mistreated by the legal system compared
to anybody else what do you think they
found yeah it's just what you thought um
as a meta
analysis the study found that uh there
was no difference in how people were
treated by the legal system the racial
bias just didn't seem to come out of the
studies so there wasn't any racial bias
in punishment that they could sus the
metaanalysis which is a study of
studies so but here's the more
interesting part when they look at
individual uh writings by academics they
find that the the academics routinely do
this they routinely show you data that
suggests there's no no difference in
treatment or penalty by race and then
they'll write an article that says
there's it's really terrible that
there's such a big difference in the
treatment by race that's right the
academics and the sciencey
people are are so out of control that
they can show you the data that's
opposite of what they write about and
nobody Cates
it these are things that nobody CAU
until somebody looked specifically to
see if the article and the data matched
and they
didn't is that
amazing people were really they were
actually showing the data the opposite
of the argument they made in the same
paper
routinely oh my God oh my God
yeah so how's that George Floyd
situation look now
um I think we could say out loud that
Derek schauen was uh is in the process
of being murdered because he's white I
mean that's pretty obvious at this
point all
right uh I have discovered at least in
my personal experience on X that there
are way more
anti-semitic
commenters is that because of the war of
Gaza or I speculate these might be Bots
and the reason I speculate that is don't
you think that the Bad Evil people on
the left hired a bunch of people to act
anti-semitic so that uh X looks like the
place that hates
Jews you don't don't well it could be a
Tic Tac effect yes it could be but
here's why they look like Bots to me in
other words paid people that are paid to
cause trouble it looks like that because
they make the same comments all the time
the the similarity of the com comments
they make at least in my posts are hard
to ignore it doesn't look like real
people who just had a thought and made a
post because you could recognize that
they're all different but when they have
this commonality to them I worry that
Elon Musk is being set
up and that there are bad people
pretending to be
anti-semitic let me tell you what they
say the the common thing that they
say
it goes like
this um if you're a casual Observer of
political news you might assume that
most of the things they tell you are
reasonably
true you know the news sometimes is
wrong but reasonably true so that would
be what I call the lowest level of
awareness would you agree if you think
the news is usually
true that's the lowest level of
understanding of your
environment if you think that the news
the traditional news sources are corrupt
then you're a little bit higher level of
awareness but people don't stop there I
don't I say why is the news corrupt and
then I back it up a little bit and I go
oh Democrats because the news is
dominated by democrats the Democrat
Party wants them to support them so
really you have to go all the way to
Democrats but
is it all Democrats and are Democrats
pushing their own
buttons here's where other people go but
not me so other people say it's not the
Democrats Scott there's somebody behind
the Democrats well who's that who's
behind the Democrats well Scott it's the
WF and the yeah it's the world economic
forum is CLA Schwab so CL Schwab is
pressing the buttons of the Democrats
Democrats are pressing the buttons of
the press and then the Press is pressing
the buttons of the voters so now now you
understand the whole mechanism but wait
we're not done we're not done say the
commenters who are streaming in lately
they say Scott look deeper it's not the
wef the WF is also a puppet is really
the
Jews now that's the comment that I'm
getting to almost anything I post if I
if I post any kind of you know the Press
is doing this or the Democrats are doing
that which I often do somebody will
enter the comments and say dig deeper
Scott you almost know who they
are now that of course is something I've
you know always heard on social
media what's different is I hear it on
all it seems like any kind of post
that has any kind of
conspiratorial people behind the scenes
or manipulating you kind of sense
somebody will come in and say you're
almost there Scott you're almost there
you haven't uncovered yet the massive
Global Jewish conspiracy that is really
behind climate change and the wef that
is really behind the Democrats that are
really behind the media that are really
the ones who are corrupting and
influencing the people now if you're
joining me late I'm not subscribing to
the WF Theory and I'm not subscribing to
the Jews running the planet through the
WF and other theor so I don't subscribe
to those so my only point is I'm seeing
more of it is anybody else seeing more
of it and do you think it's because of
the Gaza situation or or is it about
musk is it an OP or just because the
news is the news and what it is
lately what do you think I actually
don't
know uh
okay all right I'm just looking at some
of your answers to see if anything
useful comes
out all right all
right well I will just tell you I've
said this a number of
times in my
career um I get to see behind the
curtain a lot so I either know people
who are already you know behind the
curtain or I've spent enough time that I
can kind of see what's back there I
spent a ton of time around real
successful Jewish professionals and
Publishing especially in publishing
there's a high percentage um syndicate
Comics Etc I've never seen any of this
Jewish
conspiracy have
you it's hard it would be hard for me to
imagine that I wouldn't get a whiff of
it like given the access that I have I
wouldn't see any of it like ever not not
even one example
ever and yet there are people who are
pretty sure that it's it's massively
true here's what I think is
true um people do have you know extra
love for anything that's like themselves
is that fair people have a little extra
affection for anything that's of
themselves or by themselves or reminds
them of themselves or as part of their
Heritage their cultural Stu so do we
expect that uh Jewish
Americans would be more supportive of
Israel than the average American of
course
but it's all transparent I mean it's
like nobody's hiding
that and there and Israel is a good Ally
of the United States for good reasons
right now we could all argue about
funding and you know those the details
but it would be really hard really
really hard for Mia to have gone decade
after decade working with high-powered
Jewish people professionally you know
close friends my you know my college was
highly Jewish population a lot of them
were my closest friends and never see
any hint of it of the large Jewish
conspiracy
never right like I like I I try to
remain open-minded to any possibility
but that's a long time to not see a hint
of this massive force that you believe
exists but like I said certainly
individually
people have you know an extra love for
their cultural backgrounds why not
nothing wrong with that so yeah
obviously we have to make sure that our
policies are America
Centric so we got we got to be cautious
that we don't get you know biased in any
direction that's bad for America but I
don't see it as a gigantic problem at
the
moment all right ladies and gentlemen on
the uh on X and on YouTube and a rumble
