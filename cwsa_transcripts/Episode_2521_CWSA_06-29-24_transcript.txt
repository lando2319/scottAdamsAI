for the show that will be the best part
of your
day guarantee
[Music]
it good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
robots 2 and if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
understand with their tiny smooth human
brains all you need is a cup micro glass
a tanker chells or signic Cen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day thing makes
everything better it's scul simultaneous
except it happens now
go
wow all right I've got a question for
you couple of science things and then
we're going to get to the fun oh my God
is the news fun this week am I right is
everybody having as much fun as I
am honestly I don't think I've ever had
more fun just dealing with the news
we'll talk about that but question for
you Chinese
researchers have figured out how to put
a uh a human stem cell brain on a chip
so there's a little organ oranic thing
made into stem cells that mimic some
characteristics of a human brain and
they combine it
with a chip and they made a robot out of
it now I need a
ruling because apparently it works it's
not experimental it works if you build a
robot that's part human brain but had
never been part of a human so they're
just using stem cells and building their
own little thing
is it a cyborg cyborg yes or no part
organic part machine and it's a robot
but but it was never a human but it's
got a human DNA in it right because stem
cells so I'm going to say
yes I'm going to say yes on cybor well
it looks like we have more yeses than
those all right good here's a cool thing
according to Live Science um somebody
has invented regular glasses that are
night vision lenses so you would be
wearing regular corrective lenses
apparently or they don't have to be
corrective and with no extra electronics
you might be able to see in the
dark now I assume there has to be at
least a little bit of light you know not
complete dark but how would that change
things can you imagine if everybody
could just see in the dark I don't know
I feel like that's that when uh when we
got electric lights so you could work
all night I that changed civilization
quite a bit what happens if you can see
at night I don't know all right here's
some fake science for you 69% of those
surveyed uh say that cleaning the house
if your spouse or your partner cleans
the house it's their biggest turn
on yum I love it when you clean the
house I am so aroused right Now by
watching my husband clean the house no
no young people young people men I'm
talking to you young men don't fall for
this this is fake news let let me let me
explain to you how this works um doing a
survey um young young
woman uh what would be the biggest turn
on for uh your husband or
boyfriend is he going to hear about this
well I so I mean it's we're going to
publish the
results so my boyfriend's going to know
what I said is my biggest turn
on well not you personally but you know
he'll he'll look at the the
results I think my biggest turn on is
when he cleans the entire house while
I'm doing
nothing all right well write that down
that sounds totally believable um and I
can't think of any ulterior motives so
yeah yes it's probably uh your biggest
turn on to watch your husband do chores
while you're not doing
anything
no but men if you are asked what is your
biggest turn
on don't go with the old language of
love stuff like oh I I like it when she
does chores for me or I like it when she
buys me a present don't don't fall for
that don't be a sucker the proper answer
is I like it when she blows
me uh what's your language of love
blowing me no seriously uh is it uh acts
of Acts of uh service is it no it's
blowing me no but is it uh is it kind
words or no no just blow me that's my
language of love blow me your
science this is
 men like it when you touch them
and show them a little respect that's
all we don't need this and
ladies stop this like you're
turned on by us doing the dishes
you're going to be looking for a
boyfriend at the same time your husband
is washing your goddamn dishes stop this
 come on all
right um you know how I always quite
annoyingly and egotistically
say you science you should have just
asked me you didn't have to spend all
this money to do a study you could have
just come to me just come to me and ask
me the question save all the
money and you know and you're probably
saying okay that's that's a little
overdone I hope you're doing this just
for entertainment because we don't
really believe that it'd be better if
somebody just came and asked you I mean
I mean that's not going to be as good of
science Scott come on
how could it be as good as science just
asking one person I mean that's
ridiculous so here's what science just
figured out without my help at all uh
marijuana seems to improve orgasmic
function in
women you could have asked me you could
have asked
me uh here's another study you don't
need to
do uh does drinking alcohol make you
more likely or less likely to have sex
with a
stranger please just ask me next next
time you're wondering about that
science just ask me I've got an answer
for that
too well here's something I didn't know
that uh back in 2015 McKenzie the
Consultant Group uh did a research study
and they found out that that one of the
best things that a company can do for
their
profitability for their profitability is
to increase their
diversity now that was cool because a
lot of people wanted to increase
diversity for all the right reasons you
know to get your company looking like
the public and make sure nobody's left
behind and there's no discrimination and
no bias and we'd all like that no
discrimination and no bias but wasn't it
great that McKenzie studied and found
out that the more diversity you had the
more money you could make too there was
like a a pretty good connection between
if you increase your diversity you'd
increase your
money well guess what it turns out that
nobody can reproduce that study because
it was
 no there was never any
correlation between diversity and income
certainly not one that increased the
income I don't want Say It Don't make me
say
it God I can't I can't help
it you should have just asked me you
could have just asked
me or if you didn't want to ask me
because you know I got a big ego and
stuff you don't want to make me feel
like oh why do you know everything the
science doesn't know you could have
asked anybody who ever had a job
that would do it you could ask anyone
who ever had a
job you didn't really have to study this
one now I'm not saying that diversity
makes you less profitable I'm just
saying there couldn't possibly been to
any study that said it made you more
profitable that in the real world that
wasn't really possible or it wasn't
possible that you would know I I
actually don't know so I don't know if
it makes anything better or worse I I
know you can't study it that's what I
know I know you can't study it you
wouldn't know and it it seems unlikely
it would make much of a
difference all right um the Biden
Administration is backtracking this is
according to the Daily wire uh says they
don't support transgender surgery for
minors what do you think's behind
that why do you think the Democrats have
to come out against trans surgery for
minors and they say uh the
administration does not support surgery
for minors in that
context were they I I'm not sure if they
had an opinion on it before or they just
didn't talk about
it but they finally had to reach a point
where the Republicans were sort of
calling out the craziness that they just
had to find something close closer to
realistic middle non crazy CU I think
it's becoming more and more clear that
money is driving this it's not about the
it's not about the benefit of the
children I mean there's some you know
there's some belief structure that's
driving it too but the thing that makes
the hospitals do it is going to be maybe
money so I I do appreciate that the B
Biden Administration has a sensible
opinion on
this but it makes you wonder why is that
coming out
now and why did we even have to wonder
about it like the level of
incompetence coming from the White House
the lack of leadership don't you think
that a long time ago the White House
should have said just so you know what
our opinion is we're against it don't
you think that would have been useful at
sometime in the last several years if in
fact they were against it wouldn't that
be the type of leadership you of expect
from your president and your white house
why were they silent until now like you
know I hate to be the one who says what
took you so long but it's worse than
that because they were already there it
wasn't like it took so long to guess
something done or decide they already
were there I don't think they changed
anything they just decided to tell
us the the level of incompetence in
leadership is just staggering it's
staggering can you imagine Trump being
silent about that for years while it's
happening I
can't you know even if it's none of his
business you know it's private uh
Private Business even if it's none of
his business I think he would weigh in
on an opinion so you knew what the White
House was thinking all right the New
York Post had me laughing this morning
like crazy apparently Biden in a speech
used the phrase Over My Dead Body and
all they did is show a big picture of
Biden and the headline Over My Dead Body
and I laughed for 10 minutes now that is
funny it's funny because they didn't
have to find a picture of him looking
dead they just showed his normal
picture with no
modifications just
talking and you immediately get the joke
that he looks almost dead
now Over My Dead
[Laughter]
body and we don't even have to wait
until he's dead oh my
goodness well like many people I was
waiting with you know great anticipation
to see how Bill Mara would handle the
disaster that was a debate and pretty
much the way you thought it was no
surprise
um yeah here's just some of the jokes
that bill Mah said I mean he he was
brutal he was absolutely brutal with uh
with Biden as you might expect he said
he the bed so hard that the Secret
Service gave him a new name Amber herd
uh he was more lost than the Malaysian
Airline uh he likes trains but not
trains of
thought and and then my favorite part
was that Bill Mar said that at one point
in the debate Trump was so far ahead he
started talking about golf
now now that's a good joke that's a good
joke jump was so far ahead he started
talking about
[Laughter]
golf let me say I'd like to uh correct
an opinion I had I think I said that
Trump made an error in talking about
golf I don't think so
anymore I don't think
so the more I think about his
performance you know there were lots of
little things I wish he'd argued better
but I don't think arguing made any
difference at all I mean people were
strictly looking at the vibe they they
saw a strong and controlled person and
they compared it to Biden and they liked
the in control person a little bit more
the person who looked alive so I'm not
sure any of the hoax has made a
difference but I still want to push
against them all right here's the
favorite part of my day
God I love this what watching the
Democrats wake up to the fact that they
are the victims of their own brain uh
brainwashing and
gaslighting now is one thing when they
Gaslight Republicans and Independence
that's bad that's bad it's
bad but watching the Democrat you know
pundits even the professionals the
reporters watching them wake up to how
badly they've been gaslighted or gaslit
what's the right way to say that
um is really fun but also watching the
ones who refuse to wake up is even
better so Bill Maher had Chris Matthews
on um and he started to he was trying to
sort of defend you know the Democrats a
little bit as best he could there's not
much to work with and he started saying
that the debate wasn't fair he didn't
didn't say fair but he was indicating
you know that it was a it was sort of a
lopsided competition because uh Trump
kept uh telling one lie after another
and Biden couldn't keep
up that was his defense of Biden is that
he couldn't keep
up that was that was the defense of
Biden that he couldn't keep
up and Bill Mah said isn't that the
point you need someone who can keep up
imagine you're a Democrat and you're
watching Bill Maher who who has achieved
you know or or started with some form of
Enlightenment at least about part of
this and and he just says the most
obvious thing isn't that the point he
supposed to keep up now why does Bill
Mah have to explain to one of the you
know most experienced observers of
politics Chris Matthews that the point
of the president is to have someone who
can keep up with an ordinary
conversation the the fact that you even
had to have that conversation is just
delightful I I could not be more
amused anyway um Stephanie Winston
walkoff I guess she's a someone who's
not crazy about the uh Trump
Administration but
uh she said that uh in a post that CNN
is was really part of the reason that
Biden looked bad and here's what she
said no one had to say a word she
screams on X and all caps CNN's
carefully considered Framing and
lighting design effectively conveyed the
intended perceptions of fragility versus
dominance in visual composition Biden
was filmed now this is the
debate that the side by side view of the
debate she's describing uh Biden was
filmed in profile looking pale as was a
ghost Trump was filmed straight on not
looking his usual shade of Tangerine but
more like marmalade Biden is a man of
honor integrity resilience and
resolve so the reason that Biden looked
like he
was dead for three days by the time he
debated was probably the lighting and
the angle that he was filmed at you know
that's a good point cuz
I'll bet there are a lot of videos of
Biden from that night you know once they
don't show us in which he looks
sharp and totally on the ball I wish
they'd showed us some of those videos
instead of those misleading videos where
he looks like he's just about
dead all right watching Democrats attack
CNN for simply holding a
debate is a lot of fun and I might d i
like to Echo some things I saw from a
lot of smart people Elon
Musk and a number of other people I have
to say being you know one of the top
critics of
CNN I thought they did a good job how
many of you would
agree the CNN did just a solid job
Tapper and
Bash
um whatever was in their head we don't
know and that's good we don't know what
was in their head they simply gave us a
show exactly what I wanted to
say I didn't think the questions were
extra biased in One Direction I didn't
see them fact check one but not the
other I thought they did a good job now
I've been telling you for several
months that it seems to me I'm seeing
indications that CNN wants to find the
middle and actually be a useful service
to people who want the news and seemed
to me there was a kind of a marked March
toward the middle and this I think was a
highlighter there this to me this was
the highlight of their year because they
pulled off the hardest thing you can do
which is to make people on the right say
okay okay I think you I think you
handled that right so all credit where
credit is due um and especially since
I've been a you know a daily critic I
got to give them credit I can't I can't
uh I can't skip that all
right um I'm loving the uh Democrats
pretending to be surprised that Biden
didn't do well or that there was a
possibility he wouldn't do well and this
is where I like to play my game called
lying stupid or
brainwashed lying stupid or brainwashed
give you some
examples um Chris Chris Matthews also on
the bill bar said uh we don't know where
Trump is going to stop he says Trump has
made sure uh I'm going to get even with
half of this country that's probably
going to vote against me he's going
after public officials he's going after
commenters he's going yeah he's going to
go after editorial writers he's going to
go after everybody so it's not going to
be a free
country he is out there to remove
people's rights we do not know where
it's going to end nobody can sit there
and say that we know where Trump is
going to stop
so what do you
think since obviously we do not observe
anything like that in the real
world we had four years of trump you
know plus years of watching him and
there's not even a hint to that not not
even a little
bit so is Chris Matthews lying stupid or
brainwashed go lying or stupid or
brainwashed I want I actually want to
see your opinions lying stupid or
brainwashed I see all three
brainwashed
crazy well crazy I don't know no I would
rule down crazy brainwash maybe all
three all right here's what I think
Chris Matthews is not
stupid that's what I think we we watched
CH Chris Matthews for years you could
agree with them or disagree with them or
like the show or not like the show he's
not
stupid he's not even close to
stupid so I don't think it's
stupid is he
lying does he look like he's just
lying I'm going to say
no it doesn't look like lying to me
because you wouldn't tell the lie that
stupid you see what I mean if he were
lying it would be clever and it would be
more subtle and he might one thing like
you know uh I'm not worried about him
putting 70 million people in jail but I
do worry that he might go after let's
say uh a politician I like you know
something like that would make me think
you know we're we're going to have to
watch Trump to make sure he doesn't do
that because one of the things
Republicans do am I right they they
police their own
side I think I mean to me that looks
like a difference but you know maybe I'm
biased about that so I think he's
brainwashed I think he's brainwashed but
the fun thing is he's not brainwashed by
his
enemies that's the fun part it wasn't
his enemies that brainwashed him it was
his own people and the environment he
found himself in so watching people wake
up from the brainwashing from their own
team is
amazing it's just amazing like as a as a
hypnotist I cannot be more entertained
than watching the mental gymnastics
people have to do to find their way back
to reality when they've been gasless so
so badly by the people they trusted so
the people they
trusted are the problem it wasn't the
the people they think are their enemies
we didn't do this in fact Republicans
have been saying for since 2020 i' I've
been saying since 2020 I didn't think
he'd make it a full term you all
remember that
right there's a uh there's a post going
around on X about uh uh John McAfee in
2020 made the prediction that uh that
Biden would fade by September of this
year a lot of people made that
prediction a lot of us made that
prediction but here's the
thing if you're a Democrat
at what point do you realize the
Republicans had this nailed from the
start at what point do you realize that
there were a lot of Republicans who got
that whole pandemic thing
right at what point do you realize the
Republicans have been right about the
Border you know with some hyperbole that
they might not like but basically right
about the
Border how many of them are realizing
that there weren't any wars under
Trump these are objectively obviously
true things but Chris Matthews thinks
he's trying to prevent Hitler from
rising that's that looks like
brainwashing to me I'm going to say
brainwashing Ellen Barkin uh aging
actress used to be one of my favorites
she posted an X she said I thought it
was obvious to anyone watching uh that
Biden was thrown by CNN's shockingly
biased attack and approached to the
evening right at the top of the first
question was slanted to put Biden on the
defensive if you didn't before now you
know where CNN
stands so what is
that is that lying stupid or
brainwashed lying stupid or brainwashed
this one's
easy now it's definitely not
lying this one's easy it's cognitive
dissonance
cognitive dissonance is the only way you
could look at that and say that it was
biased against um Biden the only way you
could see it that way is if if your
concept of reality got warped and it can
only get Warped that fast and in that
extreme way through cognitive dissonance
this one's a clean one this one you
don't have to wonder this is not an
intelligence problem and she's not lying
you wouldn't tell this lie you wouldn't
tell this
lie like she knows that her opinion of
CNN's bias isn't going to you know
change anything so she's just I I think
she's just releasing some
frustration and we can see the cognitive
distance so she was brainwashed by her
own team and then when the brainwashing
didn't match reality that she observed
she was triggered into cognitive
distance and then imagined that Biden
probably would have well except for
CNN so that that's how she papers back
together her belief that Biden was fine
by saying well the only thing that was
wrong was something else it wasn't
Biden's brain that's that's the classic
most classic cognitive dissonance
so I want to be able to teach you that
you can see that one right away some of
these are not so clear that's what makes
it fun this one's really clear that's
not Brains it's not lying
it's cognitive distance it's a perfect
example all right the tell for cognitive
distance is that the way you interpret
the world looks absurd to a reasonable
person and it looks absurd to think the
CNN was bias against uh Biden in that
debate meanwhile Bob Woodward Woodward
you know him from the Watergate days uh
he was brought on and uh he said of uh
Biden
his performance was I sat there and
watched it and and I could not believe
it not only is this a political hydrogen
bomb for him and the Democratic party
what happened what happened it was
almost
impossible say it say it say it
Bob say
it say it come on Bob
wward say
it we know you want to say
it was it worse than
Watergate and then he went on to say
there must be a quote large explanation
for
this is he lying
stupid or brainwashed lying stupid or
brainwashed TDS would be brainwashed uh
lying stupid or
brainwashed he's not
stupid he's not stupid you can rule that
one out he's got a body of work
definitely not
stupid is he lying well I would rule out
lying because he's he's acting like it's
a mystery he says there is an
explanation but he doesn't know what it
is it's a
mystery that's not how you lie that's
not a lying pattern a lying pattern is I
know what the problem is and it's CNN or
you know something else well that would
have been cognitive dissonance too but
lying shows more certainty he's
expressing what I think is genuine
confusion and he imagines that there's a
large explanation that he can't
identify what's
that that's cognitive dissonance that's
a perfect example he he imagines that
there's something we haven't all
observed that's obvious that's that's
hiding out there outside the view of our
ability to see it that must be the big
explanation that he doesn't
know do any of you think there's
anything missing in the
story I don't I I feel like everything
is completely
transparent they had a candidate they
knew was
sketchy they didn't have many options
once he was committed he was probably
the one making the decisions Biden maybe
his staff wasn't capable
obviously and all of those things in a
very normal and obvious way get us to
this point there's no there's no mystery
here the mystery is that Bob Woodward
can't understand how how brainwashed he
was by his own side he's not able to
accept it so instead he imagines he
hallucinates the same the same way Ellen
Barkin hallucinated as CNN was after
Biden that's a pure hallucination
Woodward is hallucinating that there's
some thing un explained that if you only
knew it all of this would make
sense it's all explained there's nothing
unexplained that's cognitive dissonance
it's a very clean example the more
examples you see the better you can spot
it that's why I do this right all right
there's a the host of The View one of
them Alyssa Farah Griffin uh you should
know she's a big anti-trumper of course
because she's on
View and she was saying after the the
debate that she feels deceived by the
White House about his Fitness for office
quote I feel duped she said
Friday
um she feels duped okay is she stupid
lying or
brainwashed stupid lying or brainwashed
she says directly they must have been
lying to me
I feel duped is she stupid lying or
brainwashed well she's not
brainwashed I mean she's not brainwashed
on this topic because she's seeing it
clearly that wait a minute you must have
known this so she's not
brainwashed right is she lying no
there's no evidence of lying she's
saying it looks like they fooled me or
that they duped me that's not a lie
that's what we observe
but is she
stupid yes
obviously yes but not about
this not in this she's right on she she
has identified that she was fooled
admitting she was fooled that is not
cognitive dissonance because it's
perfectly compatible with observation
she is she has adjusted her prior
thinking to be compatible with new
information There's No Illusion going
on but you have to ask yourself how
could she be fooled by this cuz we all
were watching it at the same
time yeah it's not somebody else
brainwashing you when you're looking at
a live video and he looks he looks like
he's falling apart to anybody who's
looking that's not somebody else doing
it to you and that's not brainwashed and
it's not
lying that's
stupid that's stupid if you looked at at
Biden for a year and you didn't think
that it was at least a good chance that
he'd have a bad
debate well I I can't excuse that away
that's I think there's something wrong
with your ability to think or observe
you know maybe observing is the the
bigger problem how
about there's a bunch of Hollywood
donors that are all Panic now and the
story is that from somebody who said uh
there's a sense that the money dried up
last night meaning the debate that the
money dried up last night about 10
minutes into the
debate to which I say I don't think
that's the only thing to dry it up if
you know what I
mean imagine you're a
woman and you like your Presidents to do
a good job of protecting
you because that's like the main thing
got to be
protected did Biden look like somebody
who could protect you
or anything
else or anything
else no bid didn't does not look like
somebody who could protect you from
anything
and my theory is that that dried up the
women immediately once they realized
that Trump was strong and he likes
America and they realize that Biden is
weak and almost dead but he too likes
America
and you live in America who's going to
protect
you clearly the one who is strong so if
you go into you know the weeds of who
had the better policies nobody cares I
mean they could we pretend we care but
we vote for other reasons we vote how we
feel in energy and power and strength
and protection and who's on your side
that's the stuff that really puts puts
it over the finish line all
right here's I mean today's news could
not be more delicious the Atlantic which
is well known as just a pure Democrat
vehicle all right the Atlantic doesn't
even pretend that you know trying to
both sides things it's not like the
regular press they are just purely a
Democrat propaganda
magazine and here's what they
say they say that uh the most patriotic
option if you know if you believe the
threat that the world you know the
world's in trouble and Hitler could take
over you know Trump uh in their
view why would you run
Biden why why would Biden be your
candidate if the alternative is the end
of the country if you really believe
your own
brainwashing the first thing you do even
if you are Biden even if you're Biden
you'd say oh wow I've lost a step I've I
better you know get a better person in
here do you know where that frame comes
from that if if Biden believes that we
have all these troubles with Trump why
doesn't he make sure that Trump doesn't
win by getting out of the way because
obviously he can't
win that's Greg gutfeld's frame from the
five and from geld the show so Gutfeld
has been asking this provocative
question and I love this question
because it's a it's a total brainwash
breaker it's a antidote to the
gaslighting explain to us why if you've
been saying Democrats please Democrats
explain to us if you really believe any
of the things you're saying the fine
people hoax he's going to take your
democracy and become a dictator if you
believe any of that why are you running
Biden you know that's the opposite of
what you would do if you believed your
own your own most important story
so now the
Atlantic has adopted Greg Gill's frame
of what the hell are you doing this
can't be explained in any rational world
something has to be just badly broken
meaning the capability of the
Democrats did you ever think you would
see the
Atlantic and Fox News hosts being on the
same page to this degree
this is actually a deep agreement you
know there there could be surfacy things
a surfacy thing would be okay we all
agree that B net a bad debate this kind
of
surfacy but to take it all the way down
to um once we've all seen this why is he
still the candidate that's a deep
agreement you don't see deep agreement
you know this this far into a uh
election season
I would submit to you that something
really big may have happened that we
won't recognize until after the
fact I always talk about persuasion that
the Democrats have this hoax suracy they
they have literally a mesh network of uh
of
hoaxes now here I'm going to Delight my
technically minded people who know what
a mesh network is if you have a Wi-Fi
you probably know a mesh network is
where the kind of support each other so
they have you know I described this the
other day on the Whiteboard the reason
that they believe that fine people hoax
is because they already believed the The
hoax that he thinks that the Mexicans
are all rapists and
Killers literally something that nobody
believes including Trump so they use one
hoax to support the belief in the other
hoax and vice
versa so both hoaxes
are believable only because the other
hoax is believable and vice versa so
they bu actually a mesh network of
hoaxes so to to and by the way this is
what I've been you know dealing with as
a Persuader I've never figured out how
you could break the mesh you can break
like one at a time but then it just
heals it's like a self-healing hoax mesh
Network as soon as you're done debunking
something you can watch it reform as
soon as the conversation zone right back
to where it was it just re it heals and
what you needed was uh I'm going to go
into analogy territory a Rosetta
Stone you needed a discovery of a thing
that would allow Democrats to escape
from the gaslighting they gave
themselves they they built a world that
only makes sense within the world within
the mesh network of hoaxes as soon as
you get out of it and you realize that
the network is fake all the rest of it
is at risk for the first time now
remember I kept telling you that the
fine people hoax was the tent pole hoax
and I was saying if we can just debunk
this one that will be the Rosetta Stone
and that will be the one that lets
people say oh wait a minute if we were
that fooled about this one what about
those other ones and then they would
start to maybe look at them a little
more critically and then the whole mesh
Network would come down that that was my
thinking of the best case scenario is if
you get the big one the one that
supports all the other ones the other
ones will collapse I I completely
underestimated the power of the mesh
Network it just didn't work but it turns
out that Democrat Democrats just found
out that there was a bigger tent
pole the biggest tent pole is that Biden
has always been okay behind closed doors
and now nobody believes it nobody
believes it and everybody believes it
was a lie Democrats included they all
believe they've been lied to by the same
people who have been lying to me and to
you and
somehow that
debate became the Rosetta
Stone not for the not for the
Republicans cuz we were already you know
I I say we because I I caucus with
Republicans but I'm technically a
Democrat
um everything that they're just finding
out we all knew as base
reality we all knew it nobody's
surprised not a single person is really
surprised who who was not part of the
gaslighting you know
architecture but apparently this was
such a stark and obvious and observable
break with reality the reality that he's
fine that it's just so observably not
true that you can see that some number
of them were triggered into cognitive
dissonance where they literally believe
absurdities like CNN was out to get them
and that's the reason he looked bad or
he had one they're also saying he had
one bad day I call that the OJ defense
well OJ only had one bad
day
so I think this might be bigger than
than you
think much bigger it's not just about
will uh you know Biden be the candidate
you know that's the way we're treating
it it's way bigger you you're actually
watching uh Democrats start to escape
from the
brainwashing let me give you
uh so one one of the other the other
absurdities is that people are using the
Federman analogy to think about Biden so
you know how fedman looked like he
couldn't possibly do the job when he was
running for Senate because he had that
stroke and his brain wasn't
functioning now I like many other people
who turned out to be totally wrong were
not so sure he could recover from that
he did and I got to give him complete
credit for that um and further I'd say
he's a pretty solid Democrat right you
know if if he had to put up with the
Democrat he'd be the one like he's
pretty solid you know kind of a common
sense approach to politics don't always
agree with him but I always say okay
you're coming from this from some
reasoned opinion so here's the problem
fedman had a problem that you could
recover
from one that you could recover from
Biden doesn't have one of those that's
the problem with
analogies one is not like the other
Biden is old you don't recover from
old he he's not going to have uh like
weeks where he doesn't have a day like
that it only gets worse and so any
imagination that it was just a bad day
or transitory it's probably closer to
cognitive dissonance or stupidity or
something like
that here's another funny one uh a body
language expert Fox News has story on
this uh did a quote BR brutal takedown
on Biden's debate
performance did anybody need to hear
from a body language
expert that this looks like somebody
losing a
debate I'm doing a hilarious impression
of Biden's face in case you're just
listening to it um if you're listening
to it I'm going to do it again uh so
there'll be a brief silence for the
amusement of those watching
does do you have to be much of a body
language expert to see
this as maybe a problem a sign of
somebody who's not exactly winning the
debate yep could have asked
Scott one of my favorite personalities
who I don't agree with is uh Jen uh
weager and what I love about him even
while you know being annoyed by some of
his opinion opions is that he does not
seem to be subject to
brainwashing he does seem immune from it
his opinions when I disagree with them
look like his own
opinions they actually don't look
assigned which is weird same with Bill
Maher so th those are two people who
even when I disagree which I
do I I think well at least you thought
about it right so here's what Jen says
and he's using the word hypnosis in his
description which is yet another sign
that he has escaped The
Matrix listen to this this is from Jen
weager I think this debate was a seminal
moment in American politics so you know
he's agreeing with everybody there uh
political and media handlers create a
mirage oh hello now we're getting
interesting Reagan as Cowboy Trump as
businessman Biden as competence
Steward he's starting to sound like me
as in the media assigned your opinion he
hasn't said that but look how close it
gets and at the debate when the whole
country saw Biden as he truly is instead
of what the establishment had been
pretending he was it was a shock to the
system yep I'm hoping it's going to help
snap people especially Democratic voters
out of this hypnosis that they're
in
yep
yep um Democratic Leadership is not
actually
competent
yep yeah watching him crawl out of the
Matrix is just breathtaking and all
credit him honestly
um uh they are not more likely to win
their position positions of authority
are misleading you into believing
they're competent and
honest no this whole thing is a mirage
and you just saw the man behind the
curtain
yes now wake up oh God you're perfect
stop trusting them they don't have your
best interest in
mind they have their best interest in
mind how much do you love
that so
Jen
congratulations this this is a this is a
fully formed
mind operating in the context of
insanity and stupidity and he found a
way out this is not
easy what he's doing right here he's
first of all bucking you know all of his
audience or most of it so that's not
easy and he he's he's admitting that his
team is the problem and they are they
have brainwashed their own side to the
point of
incompetence and he's calling it out as
directly as you can and he's using all
the right words um that it's it's
hypnosis and you need to wake
up good job good job that so you know I
like to point out that you know we have
a competitive
system but the compet itive system only
works if reasonable people are making
competitive arguments I would love that
Jen could get enough of Democrats out of
the Matrix and their hypnosis that they
could form some kind of a push back
against Republican policy which by the
way I don't always
love what I do love is the country
honestly debating things that are
important showing both sides fighting it
out and finding some reasonable thing we
can live with I love that but we don't
have that we we have gaslighting versus
what the hell is going
on gaslighting versus what the hell are
you doing is not any kind of competitive
contest it needs to be a competition
about what's the best thing to do Jen
seems to be ready for that fight I'm
ready for that fight I think most of you
are ready for that fight let's have that
fight that that's that's the virtuous
fight why can't we have the virtuous
fight that's what made America America
is a virtuous fight except for the
overseas stuff we do that's crazy so
let's have a virtuous fight we could do
that we we found an accidental way to
all be in the same page which is that
the White House was lying to all of
us that is the first time we can
genuinely say okay you and I are on the
same side right now we we we disagree
about who should be the president but
we're not disagreeing about what just
happened to all of us because it
happened to all of us it's just that you
know half of the country didn't believe
it so we don't have the same mental
gymnastics that we have to solve but uh
Jank solved his so I would say if you
are a Democrat and you just want
somebody who can see through the
Illusions he's your
guy that's a that's a full-throated
endorsement at the same time I don't
agree with him everything that he thinks
about all right there's an axios
reporter talking about Biden he says
that Democrats are in full free count
mode this is Alex Thompson writes for
axios uh because they what they saw is
finally what they have been
obscuring and he says well listen I've
been covering the Biden White House now
for three and a half years so he's a
national political reporter and he was
telling CNN uh and as someone this
reported on his age quite a few times
talking about Biden I can tell you that
the White House's response every single
time that it's come up for three and a
half years has been to deflect to
Gaslight to
Gaslight this is a axios reporter on
CNN telling
Democrats that even the reporters have
been
gaslit I hope you understand how big
this is the this might be the r Rosetta
Stone I was waiting for I just was
looking in the wrong
place
um and so uh Gaslight to not tell the
truth not just to reporters not just to
other Democrats but even at times to
themselves but so he even says they're
gaslighting themselves well that part's
a little mind raing I don't know that
they're gaslighting
themselves uh I would agree that that's
probable I think it's probable that
they've talk themselves into a reality
that's not real uh but not confirmed you
know they could be lying you can't rule
that
out but I would like to offer a
clarification to axios Alex Thompson uh
first of all like I said with
Jen I really appreciate
this I completely appreciate that he's
now understanding that he got gaset
here's where I disagree
that it's their
fault that it's the White House's fault
that he got
gaslit he has a
television he can see what we see what
why is it that the
reporter got gas lit and and admits it
when you and I didn't what's up with
that the reporter's job is to tell us
what's
true but we knew what was true and we
watched him tell us what obviously was
vacating and not
true I think there's there's still a
missing part where the media says yes
they fooled us but we should not have
been fooled by something that we could
see with our own eyes so the fact that
he was accepting their narrative while
observably it wasn't
true what does that tell
you I don't I don't know how to
interpret this one to me it looks like
maybe a little ass covering you know
when he realizes how badly he'd been
duped he didn't want to say you know I
didn't notice there was anything wrong
with Biden cuz that's
embarrassing kind of embarrassing to say
you didn't
notice you know until the debate so I
think there's just a whole bunch of ass
covering going on it's like ah I think
it's CNN's fault uh no I think it's the
White House's fault how about every
reporter who lied to us about everything
forever how about it's your fault for a
change all right
if I were Trump I would remind Democrats
that their own side lied to them not
just lied to them on something small but
this Biden lie is going to destroy the
Democrat Party for a
generation if I Trump I would tell them
that directly look we all watched the
debate you know that your White House
was lying to you they have lied to you
such in such a bad lie that it could
just destroy their own party and your
preferences for a
generation when they tell me when they
fact check me they say maybe the your
economy wasn't as good as you
say Trum is a
Salesman he exaggerates everything but
you can tell by his exaggerations he's
trying to do your work and selling is
part of doing your work he's selling
he's overselling he's over
claiming and then that s him the the
freedom to negotiate towards something
in the Middle where everybody's a little
uncomfortable but it's the best you can
do to allow the fake news to continue
equating Trump's hyperbole that doesn't
pass any
factchecking to something like
gaslighting the country about who is in
charge of it who's in charge we actually
don't know they they're gaslighting us
about who the president is in effect
they're gaslighting us that a corpse is
alive at a time when we're involved in
two hot
Wars that's not
forgivable that's not forgivable not by
democrats not by Republicans and it's
going to take a generation in all
likelihood you know the the likely path
of things is that the Republicans are
going to take everything we're looking
at a world where the Republicans have
the house the Senate the presidency and
the Supreme
Court everything and that is only
because the Democrats didn't put up a
good competitor you don't think a good
Democrat could have had a nice shot at
beating
Trump I think so I think I think that
anybody who just could show that they
had a pulse and they were alive would
have be Trump because the the Press
would have lined up and and back them
because they could you know it's a
reasonable person now we can get behind
this and then they would just do what
they always do you know they would
brainwash half of the country and you
know play with some rules with the
election maybe legally but play with
some rules and find a way to win like
they have in the
past but because of their own
gaslighting primarily gaslighting of
their own
people far more than the Republicans got
gaset Republicans didn't get gaset at
all there there wasn't a single
Republican I've ever met who fell for
any of it it it was it was all an in
team kind of
brainwashing at least the successful
part was in team but think about it so I
think I think Trump is missing the big
play you know the real kill shot the
kill shot is they're brainwashing you
your own team is doing this to you if
you think that I haven't passed the fact
checking just look at what I've said
it's all at least you know directly true
and I am going to overclaim a little bit
for your benefit remember I'm on your
team now see I think the thing that
people don't understand is that Trump
doesn't have a path to win unless he
does a good job for the country there's
no winning path otherwise that they've
they've hallucinated that he can become
president and turn it into a
dictatorship that's not
real because Republicans have guns and
they're not going to let that
happen just ask no Republican's going to
let him become a
dictator do you think he'd be happy if
he became a dictator and passed the
crown down to Don Jr and do you think
Don Jr would take the crown in the
unlikely event that you know Trump tried
to create a
dictatorship his own family wouldn't be
in favor of it his own family would shut
it down so fast and of course it's never
going to happen because Trump knows it's
there's no path there now you might say
you know power is corrupting yes power
is corrupting but he doesn't have that
kind of power presidents don't have a
power to just unilaterally decide oh I
think I'd like to stay in office we got
this old military and the the Republican
Party would make sure it doesn't happen
remember the Republicans are not about
give us a dictator who agrees with us
they're about the Constitution it's the
most fundamental thing that Dem RS don't
seem to get or at least maybe this time
they don't get it why would you think
that the entire Republican party because
they like this one candidate would also
like a dictatorship that's not a
reasonable opinion it's not reasonable
that is badshit crazy stuff and you
could only get there through some kind
of gaslighting you can't get there
through thinking or observing
anything so the waking up is going to be
fun um
let's talk about the two big court cases
I'm not you should probably listen to
the legal experts on the court cases but
uh just to give you a sense of it
there's this uh one of the Supreme Court
cases was about uh the Fisher versus
somebody and the idea was that the
obstruction charges against the January
6 people um were not based on a real law
and the Supreme Court just agreed nope
there's no law like that
so apparently the prosecutions basically
made up a law in which they borrowed
from an unrelated field that said you
can't you can't destroy documents you
know if there's some kind of official
proceeding now no documents or evidence
let's say evidence that's part of a
legal proceeding no evidence or
documents were destroyed on January 6
but somehow the prosecutors decided that
even though it clearly didn't apply they
had enough power that they could make it
act like it
applied if Trump had not been
president and applied a majority you
know and uh appointed a majority to the
court makes me wonder which direction
this would have
gone so the Supreme Court has ruled that
all of those people in jail now they
have multiple charges I'll talk about
but at least the biggest charge wasn't
ever real
that really happened now the Democrats
aren't going to understand it because
it's complicated but just think about
this the Department of Justice the
weaponized lawfare Department of Justice
took a law that was clearly unrelated to
their situation and tortured it until
they could get a conviction because
everything's
fixed and the Supreme Court only because
there had ever been a
trump or Republic repan and they had a
majority reversed
it now is that the one that
um I think that's the one they had uh
justice kadangi give me a fact check
which one was uh justice katangi Jackson
Brown also agreed with was it this one
or the other
one um but there was a I saw a
fascinating uh little piece I think it
was this one
so they got at least one um bided and
appointed Justice to agree with the
Republicans and I have to say this would
be the second time I've said to myself
with my eyebrow going up huh you know
you expect the conservative judges to
just always be conservative and the the
others to be the other way but I kind of
respect that she joined the majority on
this so I'm going to keep an eye on her
and I'm going to say I wonder if she'll
be one of the superstars of the
court maybe so because anybody who can
ever anything anybody who can ever just
see the law that doesn't you know Bend
one way or the other anybody who can
just cross teams when they need to you
automatically have my respect so I'm
going to say that she has my
respect and I'm going to keep an eye on
her because she might be the real deal I
don't know know might might be a good
appointment I I don't like justices who
always are predictable if my Justice is
perfectly predictable then they're not a
Justice at all I don't need to have a
Supreme Court Justice where I know which
way they're going to
vote that's no good what's the point of
that you know I want one who can look at
it and go you know what this time might
the people you think are my team maybe
wrong so I know I'm getting ahead of
myself and she may disappoint you in a
100 ways in the future and I'll I'll
revise my opinion when that
happens all right um but anyway if you
think that the reversal of the uh
obstruction part will free the January
Sixers you might be disappointed I hate
to give you the bad
news here's the problem most of them
were charged with uh one big thing which
was the obstruction and then smaller
things misdemeanors the smaller things
like trespass
would have smaller sentences let's say 6
months to 12 months the obstruction
would have a longer sentence but the way
they were sentenced I think in most or
all cases is that the sentences were
concurrent meaning that they weren't one
after another for each crime but they
were served at the same time so if you
had a six-month sentence and also a 12-
month sentence you would serve them both
in 12 months because the six month would
be part of the 12 but the judge has
control over that the judge did not have
to rule that way the judge could have
said you have to serve one after
another now that wasn't necessary
because as long as you had the
obstruction charge you already had a
nice long sentence so the the Lesser
ones could be rolled in there and it
still look like justice to them because
it's a long sentence now if you take
away the long sentence
you left with the smaller six-month
12-month
charges one of the things the judges
could
do is resentence them so that they're no
longer served at the same time but one
after the
other and they would have full
flexibility to do that because their
opinion is the crime was so bad that it
needs to be maximum
penalty now that apparently applies to
to maybe most of the people so the
number of people who are just going to
walk out the door I think there's at
least one I I think there's at least one
case where somebody just walked out the
door uh but that's rare so they're going
to have to you know appeal the judge is
going to have to
be unusually flexible and not in the way
that we expect you know so uh that's
going to be a problem and then there's
even there's a far worse Injustice here
here here's the here's the one that's
just making me sick to my
stomach in some
cases people plad guilty to the longer
one the the uh they pled guilty to
obstruction because uh they just wanted
to make the Lesser ones go away or
something they they thought it was their
best thing so there's some people who
did some I may have this wrong but
there's some people who did some
pleading who aren't going to have the
same rights of getting things reversed
oh here's here's the story the people
who
guilty to the obstruction
part every one of them every one of them
which is weird even though was different
courts in different cases every one of
them had to sign something that said
believe it or not that if the Supreme
Court finds this this was never a law in
the first
place you can't go
free now fact check me on that but I
think I understand it they actually
forced them to sign you know under
threaded the courts they they did what
the best thing they could do at the time
they signed something that said that
even if the law they' been convicted of
turns out to not even be a law which is
what
happened they have to stay in
jail process
that let let that roll around your head
a little
bit this is the only thing that
motivates me for this election yes I
want a whole bunch of policies to be
different yes I want the country to be
different but you have to start here you
start locking up people for that because
they're Republican and let's let's not
pretend they were Republicans and they
were hunted and it was done for
malicious power purposes to create a
situation where
Republicans felt they couldn't talk and
they got pretty close to
it um was it as covich who says that the
judges should go to
jail or at least there should be a uh
some kind of a process if if Trump gets
in office there should be some kind of a
process started to actually put in jail
the
judges now I've never even heard of such
a thing but I'm completely in favor of
it I think the judges that put the
January 6 people in jail and under these
conditions a law that they knew probably
wasn't a
law um I think they need to be in
jail and but let let me be completely
clear when when people say you Trump's
going to get revenge and Justice I don't
want to see anything outside of the
legal process nothing outside the legal
process you know
why no one's Above the Law all right so
this other decision might be even more
interesting but it's going to take a
long time for the world to figure out
how important this is that's the
so-called Chevron decision from the
courts and that said that uh it's
reversing the situation we're under
where the Congress could pass a law but
then the specific interpretation of the
law and how it's you know how it's uh
implemented could be the expert
organizations that are most relevant so
uh that would allow osia for example to
tell you all had to wear masks when
there was no law to that effect I think
that was one of the examples so it's
hard to come up with examples but some
say that when you remove all the
lawmaking from the so-called
experts and the administrative State as
they call it that that's a good thing
because the experts are let's say
corrupt corrupt or stupid or political
and that's what we observe the experts
are corrupt or stupid or political and
you can't really trust that to interpret
the law so instead it will go back to
Congress and and judges I guess to
interpret the law you know like the
Constitution
intended I don't remember any part of
the Constitution that said Congress will
make laws and then they will be
interpreted by uh unelected
officials that is so far from being any
kind of a process anybody should agree
agreed to now I realize why it was done
because there's there's lots of
ambiguity and laws and and sometimes you
just need an expert to like cut through
the red tape so it might be you know
there's an efficiency gain by doing it
but what happened in that is I think it
just got politicized as soon as it was
politicized you can't do it anymore as
soon as it's politicized you just got to
say all right we got to go back to a
constitutional framework because that's
what protects us from the politization
politices
politices the
politics all right uh the most tragic
story is that Thomas massie's wife and
mother of four childhood sweetheart of 3
five years has suddenly passed away now
we don't know the details of that I I
would just ask all of
you can you just give him some
time give him some time you don't need
to be spe ulating about anything on
X and if you see somebody doing it you
maybe politely ask them to hold back on
that I I get you know I get why the
conspiracy theories are floating around
I get it we we all we all get it just
give them some time this isn't the
time you know let's let's have some
respect for the whole
situation let's just show a little more
respect you you can think things in your
head and you can talk to your friends
but putting it on X is just a bad look
right it's not illegal you know I'm not
going to come after you if you do it I'm
just saying maybe maybe find a little
Humanity here you know try try to find
something that's real and true and it's
not all about
politics all right uh representative
Anna Paulina Luna is still trying to get
those her
tapes uh and she says you know the ones
that Biden is
allegedly talking on and we saw the
transcript but we haven't heard the the
audio because people speculate that the
only reason they wouldn't let us see it
or let us hear it is that he sounds like
he's out of it and
uh representative Luna says my question
to the American people in reported is
what is on those tapes that Garland is
willing to R risk becom a Criminal by
defying two Prof two Congressional
subpoenas now that's a pretty good
question so you've got the attorney
general who is willing to become a
criminal to not show you that to not
produce the
tapes that you already have the
transcript
for we already have the transcript and
we have the you know her himself saying
that you know he was confused elderly
man so we pretty much know what to
expect on the on the tapes in terms of
they're going to be let's say uh more
informative than the
transcript we already know that why in
the world would he risk jail on a
principal that's not even a principal
there's actually no real reason for him
not to do it the only reason that
anybody could think of unless they're
suggest a better reason is
that it would reveal the hoax The hoax
that Biden was always fine behind closed
doors so I think it's exactly what it
looks
like the other day yesterday I heard uh
something I didn't know before um I
forget who said it I wish I could give
them credit but um I didn't know that
when Obama left office unlike other past
presidents
he he bought a house in Washington now
he has other homes I think but he bought
one in
Washington and he lived with Valerie
Jarrett they lived together for like
nine months now allegedly they were
working together on some initiatives
that he was doing after he was president
but some say that he's the one who's the
Puppet Master behind the
scenes there's definitely some
circumstantial evidence that that's the
case
you know this whole uh idea that uh you
can't debate a liar that came from
somebody who knows how to do this
stuff and I'm thinking it might have
been Biden or his Circle because they
know how to do this
stuff so I would say that it's at least
a strong
hypothesis uh I won't go so far as to
say Obama's running the country I think
that's a
oversimplification I think they're
entities of power
everything from the military industrial
complex to APAC to every billionaire
who's giving money so they're all these
different you know uh power sources and
they all have different influence and
different topics you know it's not it's
not all the same but one does wonder if
the politics of the White House is being
run by Obama because he knows that they
don't have the capability to do it on
their own which we can
observe so
know what to think about that but I'm
going to keep
watching well do we think that Jill is
the the bad guy in this whole story you
know what why is Biden clinging to power
is it because it's too late and There's
no practical way to to replace them
maybe is it because they gaslighted
themselves to the point where they think
he's really their best bet maybe is it
because the people work on the the Biden
campaign would immediately be unemployed
if he stopped
running
obviously obviously the people working
on his campaign would be instantly
unemployed if anybody else replaced them
because whoever came in wouldn't use the
same team even comma wouldn't use the
same team they'd all be
fired and they they apparently are
pulling the strings and Jill would be
out of the you know he she would lose
all her support um they might have some
money problems by the way I would not
rule out the fact that Joe Biden needs
the job for the
money has anybody ruled that out to me
it seems obvious he has to lead he has
to keep working for the money what's he
going to do give corporate speeches he
can't do that he's not capable but if he
just sits there in the White House and
they protect them he gets a paycheck and
then he gets all kinds of government
services that you know cover all kinds
of other
needs he may just need the money that
could be the the whole story and that
and his staff needs the money too they
might just be working for the cash could
be that
simple all
right that's what I got for you today

locals people privately my beloved local
