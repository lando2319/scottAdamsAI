wow
it's going to be a great day today
and do you know why
well for starters you found your way to
coffee with scott adams and that
identifies you as well smarter than
average probably sexier i think you'll
live longer and i've got a strong
intuition that your antibodies are way
above average
that's how awesome you are but do you
think this will be a good day for the
live stream yes it's going to be the
best day ever in the history of the
universe and all you need to get going
is a couple of mugler glasses tanker
chelsea's time i can't juggle flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
yeah it's a different mug we'll talk
about that
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
it's called this simultaneous sip it
happens now go
yeah that's so good well i have the
non-standard mug i know you're
interested in all things coffee
because my kitchen was being worked on
yesterday and i cleverly
took everything that i would need out of
the kitchen
and put it in a different room
so that while the kitchen was being
worked on and i didn't have access to it
because the floor was being worked on
that i would have everything i needed
and the one thing i forgot
i even moved the coffee maker all the
coffee
i forgot a mug
so here i was all prepared yesterday
and i didn't have a mug to put my coffee
in how unhappy was i
well i drove immediately to the
local starbucks and bought myself a
couple of mugs
anyway how many of you have seen my
uh my pinned tweet
in which i asked for people to show me
all their best memes for 2021. does
anybody spend any time
looking at that
let me just say
oh
my god
think about the funniest thing you've
seen all year might have been dave
chappelle
very funny
uh maybe there was some event or some
friend of yours the funniest thing that
happened to you all year just think
about what that is
okay got that in your mind the funniest
thing the thing you laughed at the most
all year
now multiply that by about five
and go look at the comments to my pin
tweet asking for memes
you will
i actually this is not a joke i'm gonna
say something that sounds like obvious
hyperbole
literally
meaning the actual word literally
no joke
i had to stop reading them
for health reasons no joke
i swear to god
that is a literal truth i had to take
time off
and go back in
because i laughed so hard
not a joke
i thought i was going to hurt something
it was actually dangerous
i i don't even remember the last time i
laughed that hard now here's the thing
that um is a little a humor writing tip
you ready
humor
if you look at these memes and you look
at any one individually
you might love it you might laugh
but when you see them all
as a collective you know you read a
bunch of them on different topics
it has a whole different effect
and the effect is it just brings you
into this absurdity world
where everything's absurd for a while
and you can just go live there for a
while
if you just see one meme you're like
boop boop you're in and out it's like
you weren't ever there but if you read
them all at once
you just sort of live in them for a
while
you will cry
i mean you will cry
laughing
until
i i was feeling like something was going
to give out in my actual guts
i i i can't recommend it enough
do yourself a favor
just
spend 10 minutes that's all i'm asking
if you don't cry
i will be very surprised cry laughing
that is
uh speaking of uh things to laugh at
um i was reading an article i think it
was in buzzfeed in which women were
saying what they they also saw in pete
davison you know pete davidson has been
dating a bunch of a-list celebrity women
uh that you would say to yourself or at
least men tend to say this
how does he get all these women
right and so women were asked what they
they saw in him
and i love some of the answers
for example
he's such a mess i mean i'm paraphrasing
the answers so this is my words but this
idea
that he's such a mess that you're you're
pretty sure he won't judge you
what do you think of that
he he's such a basket case which you
know he's very overt about very
transparent he'll tell you what a basket
case he is and has been
and that it makes you comfortable around
him
true
i think so i think you're more
comfortable around people who clearly
have more problems than you do
that's one thing now he's also tall he's
successful he's funny you know he's you
know getting rich
which didn't matter to the specific
women he was with
but
you know you can see all those things as
well but here's here's the funniest part
somebody in one it was a tweet that was
part of the article
somebody described pete davidson as
looking like a wet cigarette
that's good
i mean that's really good
um i i've seen people describe me as
looking like a thumb
and you know i laugh at that too
so i you know i don't want to make fun
of people's looks i don't generally do
that but when somebody makes a
like a spot-on
kind of an elegy
a wet cigarette i don't think that could
be any better could it
i mean just in terms of cruel
descriptions of people i've been on the
receiving end of lots of cruel
descriptions and i can tell you that
when they're done well they're actually
just hilarious even if it's about you
so i'd like to think that he would laugh
at that too because it's just so clever
so i think that women know that he's not
going to think he's better than them
but
and somebody else said he's a nice guy
but he's sort of confident in who he is
i think have you ever heard the phrase
people are comfortable in their own skin
in other words it doesn't matter who you
are but are you comfortable being that
person and if you are other people are
comfortable around you
now i'm not sure that describes
pete davidson because i would require
reading his mind and we can't do that
but i would say it looks like that
you know from the outside
it looks like he's
someone who's completely confident
that he is just him and he's not anybody
else he's not trying to be
so the fact that he's putting no effort
into trying to look like somebody else
i think that gives him a little credit
doesn't it
i think he's likable
i mean you know i like everybody with a
sense of humor
um so i know i would like him if he were
in the same room
so so you got that but here's the other
thing that i think people are missing
in the story the stories about all that
how all these you know top
uh let's say top celebrity and you know
attractive women all like him
is that the real story
because there's a part of the story
they're leaving out
none of them wanted to marry him
am i right
why isn't that the story
the story should be zero people wanted
to marry pete davidson
now i don't know if he wanted to get
married maybe not
but
um i'm not sure that women see him as a
keeper
i think they might see him as just a
great guy to hang around with because he
looks like he'd be fun i mean how would
it not be fun
it would be hard to even
like could you even picture in your mind
hanging out with pete davidson and not
having fun
like you really can't even conceivably
can you
so i can i i totally see his
uh his appeal i don't think
people are going to line up to marry him
right away
for a lot of the same reasons
rasmussen has a poll that biden's
approval is at 41
his disapproval at 57
but here's the weird thing
57 percent disapprove of him but yet 64
say things are heading in the wrong
direction
i don't know maybe because it's not his
fault i would think that his disapproval
would be closer to the
same as the number say it's heading in
the wrong direction it's in that
neighborhood but i'd expect that to be
closer
anyway
uh where are all the people who thought
things would be better under trump
because i don't think we got that right
or better under biden than trump i don't
think we got that
i wonder if people are noticing
so uh
uh
brian stelter was pointing out
that the january 6 committee hearings
were apparently being broadcast by cnn
but he points out that it wasn't being
carried by fox news
newsmax or one america news all right
leaning
news outlets
so what do you think does stelter have a
point
because you've seen it in the other
direction right
you've seen the other direction where
you know fox news would carry something
all day long
that uh
the cnn would not you could probably
think of some some examples of that
so does he have a point
do you feel like you're being
manipulated by
the right leaning media for not showing
you that
why don't you care
why don't you care
now i can see why cnn wouldn't cover the
trump rallies because those are purely
political
um
you don't care
okay here's my speculation about why the
people on the right and therefore the
platforms themselves don't carry it see
if this rings true with you
because everyone on the right
knows it wasn't an insurrection
so it's a committee to find out if an
insurrection happened and how it
happened and who was behind it
everyone on the right knows it's not
real
everyone
a little everyone
i think everyone in the right knows
there was no insurrection and that no
one will be charged with one
now i realize the insurrection is
difficult
to charge
but
there's nobody even close
is there they're being charged with
individual crimes which i think in most
cases they did commit
so i don't and here's the thing are any
are any uh conservatives complaining
that the protesters who literally broke
a law
are subject to you know the legal system
i haven't heard anybody complain about
that we've complained about people being
jailed for too long without the system
you know dealing with them one way or
another and that looks criminal to me
but nobody's complaining about the fact
that there's a thing called laws
that apply to everybody
all right that's my theory is that the
people on the left need to see it
because they could find out what's going
on but the people on the right already
know
there's nothing to find out
why would you show an entire
hearing of nothing
that's what it looks like on the right
now i'm being too kind because obviously
all the news organizations are
in some way brainwashing
tools
so if they choose to not show something
or show something
that is a statement about brainwashing
but in this case cnn is doing the
brainwashing and
the other entities
already said everything they need to say
there's nothing there
except individual crimes which need to
be
dealt with
all right here are some examples of
recent mass brainwashing operations and
by the way
i think we need to get away from our old
words about the so-called news networks
and social media collectively they're
not really about news anymore are they
it would be i think it would be more
accurate and without hyperbole
right i'm going to try to be
just straightforward on the facts and
not exaggerate them it'll sound like an
exaggeration
but i'm not trying to do that i'm
honestly trying to not exaggerate
i think the things we used to call the
news are so clearly now
just brainwashing operations
that i i have trouble even considering
them as news entities
they just look like
a brainwashing operation going in
different directions
that's all it looks like to me
and now there is news there which gives
them you know a reason or a cover story
for existing i guess but listen to all
these uh in my opinion these are
brainwashing operations
meaning that somebody intentionally said
let's convince somebody of something
that's not true right as opposed to just
fake news where it's just not true but
somebody actually decided
specifically let's see if we can sell
this not true thing
you had the russia collusion hoax
they knew that wasn't true
here's a new one i'm adding to my list
have you seen the
chart that shows you that at exactly the
same time occupy wall street
disappeared
for no reason
because what they were complaining about
didn't stop it got worse
if the income distribution got worse not
better but occupy wall street just sort
of went away
and then there was replaced with
critical race theory and black lives
matter and and race race race
everything's race okay
that's not natural
that's a brainwashing operation
obviously somebody decided occupy wall
street didn't work as a frame
and so they came up with a new frame i
don't know who they is you know you
could guess it's soros i know you're
gonna say soros i don't have personal
reason to believe he's the one
cause of all this stuff
but um clearly there were numbers of
people in important places that thought
that race was going to be the new frame
and so i would call that a brainwashing
operation because not much changed
right from
you know from two years ago
i don't know that much changed but
suddenly it's the biggest topic in the
world so that screams uh brainwashing
operation
uh you saw the
waukesha story
disappear
that's a brainwashing operation they
just make a an inconvenient
narrative disappear
uh of course the fine people hoax the
drinking bleach hoax were two big brain
washing operations uh they worked on the
left and worked a little bit on the
right amazingly
and then the the thought that the courts
have validated the election
that's a brainwashing operation i think
half of the country thinks that the
courts looked at the election and
decided it was fair
you know nothing like that happened
right
there were just a few cases brought to
the courts and for in the most cases the
most most of them they didn't have
standing or it was too late or you know
there was a reason that the court
couldn't look at it or it was too early
before anybody audited anything but
basically the courts looked at
a whole bunch of nothing
there was a lot of it
but all of it added up to nothing
so they they can't prove there was no
election problems they can only prove
they didn't judge that there was any
which is different
all right so those are just some
examples yeah i've i just don't even see
the news anymore as
even intending to give you news it looks
like
the intention is to brainwash
all right
i was uh
talking to a gentleman online who had
been brainwashed to believe there was an
insurrection and when i said
it was a weird insurrection because
the most armed segment of american life
didn't bring weapons
and i was corrected that there were
actually
six guns
were retrieved from the protesters we
assumed there were more but six were
discovered
do you know how they discovered them
well it wasn't because anybody had one
out
i i think you know they were probably
arrested for other reasons and or
whatever and have guns
but uh this was given to me as a reason
to believe it was an armed insurrection
that they had found six guns
and i pointed out that six guns is
roughly the amount of guns in a texas
walmart on any given moment
am i wrong
if you go into a walmart in texas
do you think there are six guns in there
i'll bet
and then how many are in the parking lot
six guns in the building but how many
are in the in the parking lot
oh 100
that's probably every walmart
so no that doesn't mean anything that
there were six guns in a
gigantic gathering of conservatives
conservatives bring guns
in case they need them
it's just standard procedure for a lot
of people
um
true or false
the public needs an advocate
for getting us out of the pandemic
constraints
we need the public needs an advocate
what we have are elected representatives
they're the wrong
people
not by personality and not by competence
the re the problem here is that the the
public and this is a rare situation
where the public's interest is just not
the same as the government's interest
normally they're really in lockstep
normally the government has to do a good
job for the people
in a way that the people can observe and
see
and that will help them get elected and
would be good for the politicians so
we've designed a really good system
you know compared to the alternatives
the the republic with you know our
democratic processes within
is really good really good
yeah with flaws of course but the best
we have
but
here's the problem
the government is has to manage for
minimum death
what is what does everybody say is the
number one job of a government
protect the citizens
am i right
everybody would agree with that the
number one job of government
is to protect the citizens
somebody says it's not
really you would disagree with that
statement
i'm saying that's the
if you if you listen to any politician
they will tell you that
that their job is to protect people
now that doesn't mean take their freedom
away
right
that means protect them make sure you've
got law enforcement make sure you have a
national defense
make sure you know maybe osha and stuff
make sure that you're not doing
obviously dangerous things that are just
ridiculous
now of course they might go too far and
that's another conversation
you know go too far and trying to keep
you safe and i think that's our exact
situation here
with that what the public wants is
an objective risk management
decision based on the best information
and for most of us that would indicate
opening up
sooner than the government wants
am i right that the public
not everybody but the public
i'd say the consensus is clearly on the
side of
opening up sooner than later
would you agree with that i could be
wrong about that but i think that's true
i see one wrong
but
if the public were sure that
they were safe enough i'm pretty sure
that they'd all be on that side
now here's the problem
you've got a government who has to
manage toward
minimizing death
but you've got a public who doesn't have
that same
single-minded focus
the public wants to live a life that
they know has a certain amount of risks
and once they've been informed and once
they've been giving some reasonable
tools to deal with the risk which we
have now
the public
just doesn't have the same objective
our objective is to get out there and
live
take some chances
the government's objective is to
minimize death they're just they're just
not compatible
and so i submit to you that the public
needs an advocate
actually somebody whose job it is i
don't know how they would ever be
you know appointed or self-appointed or
something
so that somebody can negotiate directly
with the government
because the government are not our
representatives on this specific
question
the government are our representatives
on
basically everything else
it's just a weird situation where we we
should not expect
that they would represent us
because they they have different
objectives
now that's not their fault is it
people people manage to their incentives
you can't change that people manage to
their own risk management and the
politicians have to manage for the
minimized minimizing death
and the public doesn't
so we need an advocate
now
i don't know i would be the right choice
for that but there should be somebody
who at least has
something like my skill set
maybe more credibility in a variety of
ways
but something like that
we just need somebody to speak for the
people because the government can't do
that right now
all right
there's a new technology
that looks promising
that will allow you to get a vaccination
without a needle
so there's a little device that blows of
focused air
into your arm or whatever
and somehow that air
can inject enough of the
vaccination that you don't need an
actual needle
and
as others have observed
you know we humans uh are rationalizers
we're not really rational people and i
do suspect
that i'll ju i'm just gonna throw a wild
ass number out this has no data or
anything it's just based on
living in the world i would bet ya
i will bet you that of the vaccine
resistors
25 of them are
it's about the needle
they won't say that necessarily they
might make an argument for risk
management etc but i feel like at least
25 percent
have a needle fear that has influenced
them to think they have some other
reason
that would be normal by the way
that would just be how a normal brain
would work you you would rationalize
that stuff and make you think that
you're making a rational decision
air bubbles and veins i don't know i
guess they figure that out somehow
it's not like they're shooting into a
vein it looks like they're shooting
into your skin somehow
uh that's way too high scott why would
you say 10
10 maybe
just have fear of needles fear of
needles is a big thing
somebody says two percent maybe
i know but for some people who actually
maybe would want the vaccination but
are afraid of the needles that might
make a difference then
again i'm not recommending you get
vaccinated
let me say that as often as i need to
i'll give you the pros and cons as as
they develop so this is on the
pro side
but it doesn't mean you should do it
it just means that there's lots of pros
and cons and maybe you should be aware
of them all and then make your own
decision
um
all right
let's see what else is going on other
here's the name of that company that's
making that uh uh air vaccination thing
that just blows air into you
it's a
dio synvax
d-i-o-s-y-n
like synthetic vex
and let me give you some advice
i'm going to give some corporate advice
here
to this company
so you you can just watch but this is uh
this is
intended for the ceo of
diosynvex
if you're trying to make a device
to get the
people who don't want vaccinations
a lot of them would be christian
you don't want to name your company
die o sin
vax
because dying is bad sin is bad and
some people are already anti-vaxx so dia
sin vax
looks like
i hope they didn't pay a consultant for
that name you know there's sometimes a
consultant will do that
they should pay a cartoonist
to check out company names because you
know what cartoonists do really well
mock things
[Laughter]
we're really good at that a lot of
practice
so show me your corporate name and i
will tell you exactly how i will mock it
and diosim vax
that's just asking for it
how many of you believe that pfizer's
documents their own documents
show vastly more
vaccine-related
deaths
than you have been told publicly
how many of you believe that that's uh
that's in the news and that that's real
that's actually just
news not not a rumor but it's just news
how many of you think it's a fact
that we now know that pfizer's own data
shows those vaccinations are
killing way more people
than had been reported before how many
think that's a fact
uh jet air injectors for vaccines have
been around since at least the 50s
michael says
ah
all right um
well here's what uh andres backhouse
points out uh and i always refer to him
as my
uh my best source of analyzing what is
and isn't credible when it comes to data
he's really really good at it so that's
why you should follow him
andres backhouse
and uh
he took a run at jordan peterson because
uh jordan peterson
tweeted uh some that information about
all of the the deaths with the pfizer
vaccine according to pfizer's own data
but as andres points out that if you
actually read
the details of it
it says very clearly that the deaths are
not attributed to the vaccination
that's a pretty big difference
yes there were a lot of deaths
because you know lots and lots of people
got the vaccination
and there were a lot of deaths
but a huge number of them actually had
coveted at the same time they died
they got the vaccination
but also got covered either it was you
know after the first vaccination of the
second so you would at the very least
you'd have to put a question mark next
to the people who died with coven
because we know that kills you
how do you know it was the covet and not
the vaccination or the vaccinations and
not the covet
we don't
right
so the point is that these big numbers
are simply the people we know died
it's not the people we know died because
of the vaccination
if a lot of them actually had covet
that's
pretty pretty uh pretty questionable now
does am i telling you that these
vaccinations are safe no
no
don't hear that
remember this is not the show that goes
binary
things are not all good or all bad
sometimes things can be a little good
and a little bit bad
that's that's the theme of this
live stream anyway
and
you should not believe that these
numbers uh display an actual number of
deaths
it could be
but it's unlikely
it's unlikely
it's very unlikely like deeply unlikely
as in if you have to bet your own money
against it you should definitely bet
against it
so
who knows
who knows but don't believe that this
data has been proven in some kind of a
fact and that the numbers are giant
that's just not the case all right
uh let's talk about dr peter mccullough
who uh was on joe rogan's show i think
he's been on fox he's been on laura and
grimm's show
and he's in he's one of the doctors who
has a let's say a contrarian view
about some pandemicy vaccinationy stuff
how many of you are familiar with dr
mcauliffe
and uh would find him a credible voice
go
how many find him incredible
and are familiar with him
uh on the locals we're seeing just a
wall of yeses
one maybe don't know but yes yes yes
very credible
over on youtube
i'm saying yes yes yes yes yes yes one
no
uh talk to your individual doctor good
advice
i mean how do you know your individual
doctor is the smart one
very all right so almost universally you
would consider him credible
right
good
excellent
i was hoping you'd say that
because here's the part
where things get interesting
okay
here's my opinion
about his credibility
i don't know
i don't know
how would i know
like if he says a bunch of doctory smart
sounding things how would i know if it's
true
no i have no way to know i could check
his facts as people said
but what have i told you about doing
your own research
does that work
i've never seen it work
it never works do you know when it works
i'll tell you when do your own research
works it's a very limited
very limited situation
doing your own research works if your
name is
andre's backhouse and you have a phd in
economics
if that's the case for you
do your own research probably tell you
something you didn't know
but for the rest of us and i include
myself in this category no we can't do
our own research
that's ridiculous we'll just confuse
ourselves
we'll just find the things that agree
with us and and come out of the the well
thinking we proved it
it's just a confirmation bias
thing so many of you said scott scott
scott
you are you were showing some doubt
about this doctor
but you didn't do your own research and
you didn't even listen to him
and that both of those things are true
i listened to clips but i didn't listen
to this whole thing so can i be
confident
about his credibility if i haven't
listened to his whole thing i've only
listened to a little bit
uh
and i'm not an expert and i haven't done
my own research
you know how confident can i be in my
opinion
what do you think
well let me
let me uh poke at it from a different
few different angles and find out
which parts of this you would disagree
with
number one
this is what i call a category
problem
if you tried to figure out what's true
or not the first thing i do is say what
category is it
i'll give you an example
your neighbor says
he saw a ufo
and it abducted his family and took him
away and then returned them intact the
next day
that's a category
that you can reasonably assume
most of the things that are not true
does it mean that your neighbor was not
abducted by an alien nope
nope does not mean that
this might be the one time it's true
but
your starting point if you hear somebody
was abducted by an alien is
i'm going to say 95 chance that didn't
happen
how often would you be right
if you just went into it with a
95 chance that did not happen
well so far you'd be right every time
every time
right how about if you heard that your
neighbor
had built a
fusion
reactor in his garage
which is by the way actually things that
have happened i think somebody actually
did build a
i think it more than once
somebody thinks they built a fusion
reactor in their garage
that category how often is that category
turning out to be true well zero so far
but
there might actually someday be somebody
who made a fusion reactor in their
garage
could happen how about the uh inventor
who invented
a cure for cancer
and it's going to trial and man does it
look good uh worked in the animals it
worked in the test tube it's going to
cure
most cancers
that's a category
how often does an individual claim
in the cancer curing category turn out
to be true
rarely
five percent now we get to keep all the
five percents that are true
and so actually uh cancer cures are
building up and actually getting pretty
substantial at this point but they're
all the
exceptions it's just the exceptions we
keep we sort of forget about the ones
that didn't work
so those are three categories and there
are lots more
where as soon as you hear the category
your brain should automatically go into
the probably not mode
but still
it could be the five percent
right
somebody said to me uh scott
wouldn't that describe you in 2016
weren't you and the five percent who
said trump was going to win that
election
even though
almost all the experts said no
so scott aren't you being a hypocrite
because you are exactly what you
describe as non-credible to which i say
good point
exactly
if you believed me in 2016
you might have made a bad decision
because i was a category
that should have been wrong
95 of the time
but
my five percent came through
now i think it's true
because i could see he had you know i
had i had some extra information
right so it wasn't so much
that i was a rogue it was i just had the
information you didn't have if you had
trained as a persuader and other people
who would also have that training could
see it too so that was the special case
but i agree totally
that if you were going to bet money on
it
the smart money was betting against me
you get that right i got that one right
but the smart money would have been
against me and even i would have bet
against me
you know if i were looking at me from
the outside i would have bet against me
because i was a category that's usually
wrong
all right
so i say also that the rogue doctor
category
the doctor who is saying things that are
quite different than the mainstream
is a category that is 95 percent
wrong so if you're going to
bet against it every time
five percent of time you'll lose your
bet
now is
is dr mcauliffe
in the five percent or the 95
i don't know
i don't know
how would i know
how do you know
how could anybody know
it's unknowable
i'll tell you what people said to me
they said scott says scott listen to the
whole thing if you listen to the whole
thing it's way more credible
do i agree
absolutely
if you listen to the entire presentation
of anybody who's wrong
it will look really credible by the time
you're done
also anybody who's right
those two will look the same to you
because you can't really judge
this rogue doctor
if he makes a claim i'm not going to
look it up i mean i could but i'm not
so
be very very careful
now let me let me give you a couple of
hints
that are by no means
the end of the story
i'll tell you one thing that is biasing
me terribly
and i'm going to give you a little
persuasion lesson here all right now i
want to be clear
and this is a very subtle point but it's
so important
this doesn't mean he's not credible i'm
gonna i'm gonna play you a clip of dr
mcauliffe's voice
i'm gonna put it in the context of
persuasion
and i'm gonna tell you that the voice
technique he uses
is um
is non-persuasive
but that doesn't mean wrong
okay let me be clear i'm not saying he's
wrong
i'm saying he's choosing a style of
communication which instantly smacks as
non-credible to me
and i i've described this before i think
did i describe this only on locals or
did i tell the youtube people too
uh have i described the pleading voice
there are two ways to talk when you're
persuading
one is the matter of fact voice
where you're just laying out the facts
and here they are
nothing to nothing to talk about
that's persuasive
but if you're saying this
look at the data look at the data
that's the pleading voice
that's begging the viewer to believe you
because you don't believe yourself
that's why it's non-persuasive you sound
like a person who hasn't convinced
themselves
because why are you talking that way
right
now if you want to see an example of the
best
persuasive voice
it's just really good there's a
series on hulu i think
called dopesick
it's the story of the
oxycontin and the
purdue company and the sackler family
now i've just watched the first of
uh first part of it but there's a scene
in there if you watch that there's a
salesperson who was played by an actor
and then the actor is giving his pitch
to a doctor
listen to that
you you want to see how to modulate your
voice
to be persuasive
i don't know if that was the actors what
the actor brought to the role
or if it was directed that way or
written that way
it's a little unclear but some
combination of the writing and the
acting and the directing
gives you
perfect persuasion voice now when you
watch it
don't be fooled by the fact that the
actor also has a very pleasant voice you
know nice
a nice rich you know deep kind of voice
that has nothing to do with what i'm
talking about right that that's not
technique that's just something he was
born with
he may have a little technique
but just listen to the matter of
factness
as he lays out the facts
which you find out later or actually you
find out soon are not facts
but the way that that salesperson lays
it out
damn you would think that was true it is
so persuasive
even knowing it's not true you think it
sounds pretty good
all right now compare that with i'm
going to play just the clips
and and look for uh this is dr mcauliffe
on uh joe rogan's show
and listen to the voice and see if it
sounds like matter of fact or
pleading with you to believe
introductions these books are basically
non-fiction they have a thousand
citations in the breaking book showing
how it was coordinated and planned now
bobby kennedy has this book out the real
anthony fauci i'm the most uh mentioned
physician in that book i can tell you
that if you want to find the evidence
that moderna was working on the vaccine
before the virus ever
emanated out of the lab if you wanted to
find the the collusions and the
operations between the gates foundation
and gavi and sepi and pfizer and moderna
and the vaccine manufacturers and the
wuhan lab and the national institutes of
health and ralph barrican university of
north carolina engineering yes this is
organized if you want to see the johns
hopkins planning seminar called the
spars pandemic in 2017 where they had a
similar museum people showed up they
wrote up their symposium findings they
published this it says it's going to be
a coronavirus it's going to be related
to mers and tsars
now
again i have to have to be really clear
the way he the way he communicates uh
biases me to think that it's not
credible
but
it could just be a technique problem
you get that right it could be
um
oh even in the not sped up uh playback
yeah i think mine was sped up so don't
be fooled by the rapidness of his
talking that's not what i'm talking
about i'm talking about the
the pleading quality which you you could
hear at that slow motion the same it was
also sound pleading
but um
oh okay
somebody's saying let's see if i can
change the speed i don't know if i have
that option on
the twitter playback
doesn't uh i can't do that quickly but
if you'd like to do that yourself that's
a fair that's a fair comment by the way
that speeding it up changes uh how it's
received but i think you'll see that if
you play it slowly
uh you get the pleading just
it's just slower
but you're right that wasn't fair to
show it
so let me acknowledge that wasn't fair
to show it at a higher speed i didn't do
that intentionally i must have some
setting in youtube
but
doesn't mean he's wrong
right
you got to be really clear doesn't mean
he's wrong
but he's using a communication style
that screams not credible
whether it is or not
alright so i hope you learned something
i hope you learned something from that
let me tell you the other thing that
gave me pause
uh joe asked him about masks
now what do you think a doctor should
say about masks
well
he gave a very indirect answer which i
felt was playing to the audience
it looked like
his honest answer may have not been
exactly what
joe rogan's audience wanted to hear
that was just a feeling i got again i'm
not a mind reader so i can't know what's
in his head that would be unfair
but i'll tell you the way i received it
was
he was tap dancing on masks
and the moment i heard him tap dance on
masks
i lost all belief in anything else he
had to say
so as a general rule if somebody has a
large message and there's only one part
of it you understand and you know that
part doesn't make sense
you are free to extend that lack of
credibility to the whole
that would not be irrational if you knew
you know there was just one part of it
you could be certain about
right
so i'm still seeing some complaints that
the speeding it up changed everything
uh
let's let's look at it again tomorrow
i'll check it on lower speed i don't
think it changed everything
i think it i think it did exacerbate it
but the effect is still there
um
you know the the the pitch
is not important except for the how it's
modulated
right
so it doesn't matter that he has a
high-pitched voice or lopez choice
that's that's not part of persuasion
you know the the low-pitched executive
voice
it can have a little persuasive value
but you don't really need that it's
optional
he has a great track record with his
covet patients do you know who else has
a great track record with her covet
patients
everybody
because we've got really good treatments
now
plus most people get better
all right
um
by the way dopesick that
is really well done i i thought that i
wouldn't like it because it was just
going to be sad and
poorly made but it's actually made so
well just the the artist the artistry of
you know making it
is really high so it's really good to
watch
um
all right um
so somebody asked
if a cartoonist is credible so i i
tweeted his question because he had a
little
graph there the last i checked it 59
said i was credible
22 say i'm a paid operative
22
22 rounded up to
25
yes that's exactly the number of people
who answer every poll
wrong
no matter the question
all right uh
here's a list of how to participate in a
debate if you have nothing to say to me
uh you could use any of these phrases to
show that you have put no thought
whatsoever into your point of view
and uh you just wanted to say something
so sometimes we just like to say
something you know be part of it
so if you'd like to be part of a
conversation with me on some topic
and uh you don't have anything
whatsoever to say of use faul use any of
these uh
phrases
he's jumping the shark now
he jumped the shark now
well look who's the pointy-haired boss
now
i guess i guess we know who's the
pointy-haired boss now
that's just like the matrix
that reminds me of soylent green
oh oh so you're an apologist you're an
apologist now can we call you an
apologist you apologist
i saw it with my own eyes scott
don't tell me it didn't happen i saw it
with my own eyes
heard it with my own ears
so say that
any sheep references are good
sheep
you're sheep somebody's a sheep
everybody's a sheep
any kind of sheep reference is good
uh also 1984 the book hitler and
anything with fascist of course just
throw that into any reference goes with
each of these go with every argument
really
now on the sheep reference
may i say this
i think the sheep reference is the
lowest level of thinking in the pandemic
somebody's oh yeah scott is such a
sophist
i have to add that to my list
yeah that's a good one
you know everybody's a sheep right
so the funniest thing about 2021 is
sheep calling other sheep sheep
and then the sheep that they're calling
sheep are saying
i'm not a sheep you're the sheep
and like nobody's aware that we're all
sheep
well here's what i mean by that
with the vaccinations
uh the anti-vaxxers are saying you're
sheep and you're you're afraid of covet
that's why you're getting the
vaccination
but then the sheep say but wait a minute
are you afraid of the vaccination
i'm afraid of the covenant
you're afraid of the vaccination
doesn't that make both of us sheep
i think we're both sheep
because we're both afraid of something
and we don't know
right
so as soon as you think it's the other
person who's a sheep
you you've left the ground of
of rational conversation
uh here's something i didn't know this
is also an andre's backhouse
uh discovery
meaning that the data was already out
there easy to find but for some reason
he got it and you you didn't
did you think the suicides went up
during the lockdowns
how many of you think the suicides are
up during the pandemic
reveal yourselves
how many say suicides are up
they're down
but
not equally
turns out that they're down
in uh every category except uh
no way
they're down
no they're up in every category except
adult white men i think
should i read that right
um
yeah i think that's it
so only only white adults
had fewer suicides
but other groups had a little bit more
but overall because there's a lot of
white adults killing themselves
so i guess it's not men it's it's adults
and it says the overall decline i think
this was from npr
the overall decline was driven mostly
almost entirely
by a drop in suicides among white people
who apparently kill themselves at a
higher rate than any other group did you
know that
did you know that white people kill
themselves at the highest rate
now
how do you define equity
because i've said this before shouldn't
you just
measure everybody's level of happiness
and if they're similar you're done right
you don't have to give anybody extra
money or anything if everybody's equally
happy the way they are
but
but if white people are killing
themselves at the highest rate
um
i think that's a red flag
or maybe we're looking at this whole
equality thing in an a less than optimal
way
um but i guess for
uh
anyway
so i have some
theories about that
here's one of them
i'm not sure that we counted uh suicides
correctly during the pandemic
or in general here's why
a lot of suicidal people are also drug
addicts
because why wouldn't you be really
if you're suicidal it almost doesn't
make sense not to do drugs
you know okay i shouldn't say that take
that back that was an irresponsible
thing to say
bring it back
there are some things that are true but
you just shouldn't say
so
i shouldn't have said that
but it's true
um
and in
i have a
well i won't tell you
why i think this but i do know that uh
people who take too many drugs and stop
worrying about overdosing might be in
the suicidal group
so i think some of the some percentage
of the the overdoses are
let's say a
accidental death
without much regard for whether they
would die
meaning that people didn't protect their
own life
because they weren't that concerned
about living is that suicide
if you do things that you know could
kill you
because you're not interested in living
it's suicide-ish even if you didn't know
what would happen on that particular day
you know you might be just
you know
redlining how much drugs you're taking
but not really planning to die
you're just okay with it if it happens
i don't know so i i would question the
data but um
my if you remember i don't know
i don't know if i'm remembering it right
help me with my memory i feel as though
i predicted that during the pandemic
there would be fewer
suicides
and my thinking was
that people would be in close quarters
with their families
they wouldn't be bullied at school the
same way
and that there would just be sort of
less opportunity because we'd all just
be around each other and you know we you
know our
i guess our lives would be constrained
you know but you'd be with your family
more even if you didn't like it
i just i just felt like the situation
was we'd be watched too much and there
would be less of it
now i don't know if that was a good
prediction or not but
i did not predict that there would be
more of it early on later on when the
statistics seemed to show that there was
more of it i think i i adopted that view
yeah red fury is asking did scott really
say that that's what i'm asking i'm
asking because i might have a false
memory of that
and i know that i had at least two
different views i think i started with
oh i'm seeing lots of yeses on locals
people do remember
i started with the view that there would
be fewer of them but i
changed it when the data said otherwise
but apparently it doesn't apparently the
data doesn't say otherwise anyway
that is about all i have to do
for today
um
loneliness yes
there was less loneliness i imagined
during the pandemic
weirdly good thanks for reminding me
i'm now going to do something
that will change the lives of
approximately one percent of you
you want to stay around for that
it'll be fast 99 of you no difference
one percent of you i'm going to change
your life right now
i went uh approximately 60 years of my
life believing that i had terrible
allergies and those allergies were all
the time
i started experimenting by cutting out
different food groups
to see if maybe i had a food allergy
that i was fooling myself into thinking
it was just you know
you have some kind of a
grass allergy or something
and
finally i took out of my life one item
which was salad dressing
it turns out salad dressing has this
additive called sulfites it's a i think
it's a
keeps it from spoiling or something
so sulfites
because i first noticed that i became
allergic to alcohol and i couldn't
figure out why it's sort of a mysterious
thing
but
i cut out a salad from my life
so to get rid of the salad dressing and
my allergies completely transformed i do
have some kind of baseline allergies but
it went from the worst thing in the
world to just sort of a small bother
now
here's the first tip you should do that
if you have allergies yeah wine is the
worst
you should do that if you have allergies
try to
rigorously
stick to a certain kind of diet for a
few weeks
and then maybe take out one item
just one item keep the same diet minus
that one item and then just keep
repeating that
because i believe that a lot of you have
food allergies not necessarily the same
one i have but i think a lot of you have
food allergies
that you think are regular allergies
now in my case i went to test this the
other day and i said to myself i want to
be positive it's the salad dressing so
my first salad in months
and for three days i could hardly
breathe
it took days
for it to die down days
and i stayed off salad for a few days
and now i'm back to normal
so
about one percent of you are going to
look for sulfites and here's the trick
they're not listed on the package
how about that apparently it's one of
those agree ingredients you don't have
to list
but it typically is in dressings
right if you eat whole foods well here's
here's the easy way to test it just eat
whole foods for a week just nothing
that's packaged and nothing that's a
sauce
right just see
if you eat nothing but whole foods for a
week
you will feel really different
i've tried that and i hate it because i
don't want to eat whole foods all the
time it's too much of a pain in the ass
it's not delicious
but you will feel different i guarantee
it you'll feel it
all right that's your last tip of the
day i gotta run and do something bye for
now
