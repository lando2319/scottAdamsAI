everybody
so we've got a laggy bad wi-fi
connection here on locals and who knows
if
youtube is going to work but what i do
know is it's time for the simultaneous
except all you need is a copper glass or
mug a canteen jug or
flask a
something something something a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope beauty of the day
thing makes everything better are you
ready
go
paper cup coffee
not as
good protein bar not my regular kind
everything's wrong
well yeah we'll talk about the great
replays man
so that seems to be the big story of the
day we've all been waiting for the hoax
of the day
this one seems to be based on
uh the shooting
of yet another little turd who's killing
people for no good reason
um
and this has caused cnn everybody to
blame it on tucker carlson
now is it my
imagination
or does the left think that tucker
carlson runs everything
because it seems to be that they believe
if they can take tucker carlson out
they can end the democrats you know
communication channel
and it's it's almost true isn't it
i feel like tucker carlson has become
the primary
republican voice for people who are
really
sort of watching things
but let's talk about that
so tucker carlson has spoken of this
so-called great replacement theory
would it be possible for me to speak
about it
without being accused of embracing it
what do you think
if i saw if i simply broached the topic
would i be accused of embracing it and
therefore
a white supremacist
it seems unlikely
i don't know if you've watched
there's there's a
a minor drama going on in my public life
uh there's a specific individual who i
won't name
who's who runs a little cult so he's a
cult leader of some sort he has a man
cult
and he's decided that he's really really
mad at me
for my uh support of masks during the
pandemic
which never happened
so there's an entire organization who
you know his members and his leader
attacked me on a regular basis they
created accounts on social media to come
after me and their biggest complaint
is how pro mask i was which actually
never happened
literally never happened
so i never recommended them never was in
favor of them i talked about it
i showed you some studies
but uh so so my life is uh
influenced by somebody who has a
completely wrong opinion and obviously
never really watched anything i said
but he's decided to wrap his life around
it
okay
all right
so there's somebody out there who's got
a like a whole mission to destroy me
based on
something imaginary
now that's my normal life
my normal life is people coming after me
for imaginary things it happens every
single day it's the hardest thing
so let's talk about replacement theory
so i saw uh tucker carlson talk about it
the following way
he described it as math
that if you're in the united states and
you have a vote
it wouldn't matter if you were democrat
or republican
and you add more people from other
countries
it will dilute your vote
because of math
now is there anybody who doubts the math
that there's an existing group of people
who could vote
and then you were to add new people to
that group wouldn't matter where they
came from
it wouldn't matter
would that group the original group have
less influence per person
is there anybody doubting the math
now my understanding is that
tucker just showed the math
and said well yes literally
literally and mathematically
no the math is that if you add something
to an existing group you dilute the
group
right
so that's not really a
that's not an opinion
so
so cnn has treated math like an opinion
no seriously
cnn's actual editorial opinion
is that math
and the result of it is racist
and that actually is the biggest story
today the cnn thinks bath is racist
because when
when tucker carlson
gives them a math lesson it's coming
from tucker carlson
so
i guess logically qed
therefore must be racist
now the part they don't say
is they're assuming that tucker
carlson's entire uh motivation
is to have fewer brown people and more
white people
has like him
said anything like that
that would be a different conversation
right because he does talk about culture
now
is it true that if you have an existing
culture
and you were to add people from a
different culture to it
would the existing culture stay exactly
the same
or would it change exactly the way we
like things to change which is we like
to be influenced by each other and
develop our own civilization
so if he says that the way things are
the culture would change
if you added people from a different
culture it wouldn't matter which one it
was
would it be different
yes and if you liked it the way it was
would you be happy that something
changed well people don't like change
if they're already happy they don't like
change
now which of those statements from
tucker are the big racist ones
the one that's math
if you add people to an existing group
it dilutes it
or the other one that's also basically
math which is you add different cultures
to an existing culture
probably the the average is going to
change a little bit
those literally are both math
and the plumes
yeah whatever happened to plume theory
all right you now you're going to make
me talk about it
did
did that uh the plume theory was that
how much coveted you got initially would
have a big impact on whether you got
sick
did that get debunked
because i thought that was basic
understanding i didn't think that was
even a question was it a basic
understanding that if your initial
contact was a little bit of virus
you could still get it
but if you got a little bit of virus
maybe your body could you know mount a
response a little better
than if you just slammed it with a ton
of virus
is that not true
it is getting infected with a tiny bit
of virus
exactly the same as taking a big swing
if you've been drinking on the cup
what do you think
now i think that it's probably different
because i haven't heard
i haven't heard anybody revise that to
me
now
i've seen david g do the lol putin
theory
if that's the best you have as your as
your counter lol
you don't have anything
because
do you know what argument i'm making
about masks
math it's math more viruses worse
less virus will give you a better
situation
does anybody argue with with the
let me see in the comments in the
comments
is it would you accept the assumption
that more exposure to virus initially is
worse yes or no
is more exposure initially worse for
your outcomes
give me your answers more exposure
better or
worse i'm saying people are saying yes
on locals
somebody says unknown well you know the
experts said it's worse
all right you two were seeing some no's
oh interesting
on youtube you're saying it that the
amount of initial virus doesn't matter
some people are saying that a lot of
people say yes
yeah the concentration and the amount
yes
all right
so
uh
more is worse yeah so i think you would
find more is worse there's no question
about that
now if you have a barrier which is
sending your plumes sideways and up and
down
instead of directly like a fire hose
into somebody's mouth when you're
talking to them which is likely to give
you more virus
when we measure masks
what do they measure
they measure infections don't they
do they measure outcomes
has anybody done a study that said that
the people who got it from somebody who
had a mask on
had as bad outcomes as somebody who got
it from somebody who had no mask
what do you think am i balls too yes i
balls in them
so
to me my argument is only math and
people have sent us an opinion
is math an opinion no math isn't a
 opinion
it's math
tucker's opinions are math
my mask opinion is that i don't want one
and it didn't make enough difference
that i think it was useful
right so i've always been against them
but not because they make no difference
there are lots of things i'm against
they help a little
right they just don't help enough
somebody says this is not math
yes it is
i use math plus engineering
the engineering part's obvious
that the mask sends the plume
sideways it up
that part's obvious
because you can't blow out a candle with
a mask on
why does it not work the same with
omicron omicron is just catchier that's
all
right
now
statistics are an opinion
well
maybe it's an opinion about who did the
math right i suppose
all right only with a crappy mask i
suppose that's right too what else is
going on
all right so
um
it looks like this great replacement
thing will be the new cnn hoax or at
least they'll ride this for a while
and the republicans are trying to
respond by saying well you guys did some
bad stuff too that's not very strong
so wow
is that the best they have the great
replacement theory
um
scott krog says let's see how many
people agree with scott crock he says
scott let's be honest
you were pushing the vax pretty hard for
about two months all right those of you
who've watched me the entire time
how many of you uh agree with uh stupid
 scott crock
how many say i was pushing the vaccine
pretty hard for two months
100 people who watch me every single day
on locals are saying no 100
100 scott
scott grog
so what the were you looking at
scott because it wasn't me
you must have you must have confused me
with because are the
people who won't say anything positive
about the thing they're against
right so scott you may be projecting
you may be projecting yes you're
projecting because you saw somebody
reasonably say huh you got this on this
side you got this on this side and you
saw that and you said well he must be a
 idiot because he's looking at
both sides that's what you did that's
what you did scott
you look you saw somebody looking at
both sides
and you couldn't handle it because
you're a idiot
so don't come here
and tell me what i'm thinking when you
don't know and you don't understand
anything about the topic or how to talk
about topics so you don't not only do
you not understand about vaccines
probably probably
but you don't understand how people talk
you don't understand this thing a little
bit of something doesn't tell you
anything you don't understand a
thing about the world scott
so go away
please leave the broadcast
all right
um
yes i didn't give any medical advice
that i'm aware of
um
i saw the adam scrabble tweet today
and this is a two-part story
the first part is i saw an adam scrabble
tweet
do you know the last time i saw him
tweet
was
months ago
and then elon musk uh informed us that
if you tap that little star icon in the
top of your app for twitter
you can get it to give you your
your tweets chronologically just as they
come in instead of having the algorithm
decide what you see
and as soon as i turned off the
algorithm what do you know what happened
well there was an adam scrabble tweet
so for the first time
he wasn't blocked in months and months
so let me tell you what he said since i
got to see him for the first time in
months thank you twitter algorithm
um
so russia's current account
is at a record high
meeting you know cash that they're
getting in from exports
so from that one measure of russians uh
the russian economy it's doing better
than ever and that's just one
measurement within a larger economy
and then eurozone's plunged into a
record deficit
so that's not good
do you believe anything that comes out
of russia
because only russia would know what the
current account for russia is right or
is that something that everybody has
access to
to me it sounds like this is a whole
bunch of lies
let's talk about putin
dying
i saw a tweet which i tweeted
from somebody who i'll give you this
name jack hopkins
i don't know who he is he's he's a user
on twitter
but he didn't look crazy
and that and he said that he used to
manage an oncology floor
so apparently he spent years around
people who were known to be dying of
cancer
and he he shows a picture of putin's
face now all puffy looking
next to a picture of him from just two
years ago
and he says i've seen this look a
million times he's dying at some rate
basically has terminal something
probably cancer
do you buy that because somebody who
managed an oncology floor
says i've seen this look a million times
this is it what do you think
do you believe
somebody says altered photos well no all
of putin's photos have that same puffy
look lately
uh you believe he believes that he does
somebody says heart failure
does heart failure make you look puffy
um
it does okay and how about uh
how about cancer and steroids right make
you look puffy or something
so
my take on
putin from quite a while ago
was he looked like he was dying
do you remember when i was saying how
long ago was i saying that putin was
dying
six months ago
can somebody give me uh
when's the first time you heard me say
it
five months ago
six months ago or ish right
now when i said putin was dying six
months ago and you could tell because he
just looks it
where i said he was sick one or the
other
um
how many people agreed with me
if you wait longer he's done
and and i got mocked didn't i didn't
most people mock me
and my argument was that people can
identify illness
fairly well
and that just looking at them actually
is better than you think as as a way of
predicting heavy skills the humans
actually are pretty pretty good at
determining illness
just looking you don't have to be a
doctor in it
um yeah norm norma golf
yeah nor mcdonald puffed up
that's a actually i hate to say that was
a good example wasn't it
um
at first he said he thought he was on a
testosterone
well it looked like he was on
something looked like he was on
something
so
um
yeah so anyway there's i think there's a
big health problem
and the rumors about a
coup already starting
would make a little bit of sense
with the military
situation
here's a way to understand why russia's
military is not succeeding so well on
the battlefield
you ready for this
because they know that putin's a short
timer
that could be why russia is not
performing on the battlefield
because imagine that you are one of the
leaders
and you know that at the end of this
there's a really good chance you're
going to be brought up on war or crime
charges
pretty good chance
how would you play it if you thought
putin would only have a week or two left
in office
would you go balls to the wall
and do every
you know
military
war crime that you possibly could
or would you slow walk it
exactly
if you were a military leader and you
saw that putin was not going to last you
would slow walking
and it's hard to explain why the russian
military is doing so poorly
you know we we do know that the opinions
of american training nato training and
that and great weapons
maybe that's enough maybe they're just a
really really good
military the ukrainians that's entirely
possible that could be the entire
explanation
the other explanation
is that russia's military isn't exactly
taking orders from putin the way they
used to
the way they used to is if i don't do
this he's going to kill me
right
if i don't uh sacrifice a third of my
troops to take this
town i will personally be killed i'll be
jailed
so then you you sacrifice a third of
your troops because you got to do it
otherwise you die
but what happens if you think putin's
not going to last
do you sacrifice a third of your troops
or do you tell putin um there's some
something stopping you from attacking
uh yeah we're gonna attack as soon as
we get those new supplies you're sending
oh the new splice of the wrong kind
well as soon as
we get those new new supplies we're
totally going to attack that down and
take it even though a third of us will
die
it feels like russia started slow
walking the war
now remember that i told you this
and wait to see how long it takes for it
to be in the mainstream media
how long do you think it will take
because nobody said this yet right
i don't believe anybody has said that
the russian military is slowing down
because they also expect putin not to
last
well
i i think you'll see it by the end of
today
by the end of the day
all right
um would you like a movie recommendation
since i've told you that all movies suck
and they don't make good ones anymore
i actually watched a movie
last night on my ipad
there was a good movie
it's called uncharted
have you seen it
and you know i'll give away the
thing or anything so who's who's the uh
the young actor who played spider-man
recently
um
oh is that a cohen brothers yeah holland
right
tom holland
so tom holland uh is really fit i didn't
realize he was he was cut pretty well
and he plays a guy a normal guy
who is just really coordinated
just really really coordinated
and i love what they did with the action
scenes
because just making an ordinary guy just
really coordinated he just does lots of
things that really coordinated people
can do
and it's really fun to watch and i
you know i'm tired of movies
i'm tired of movies because
it's all the same movie there's somebody
tied to a chair
and torture
there's a car chasing
blah blah blah blah it's you know
there's one person fights against 25 and
beats them it's all the same
but this movie actually found a way
to create to create completely new
action scenes in the air
that they were pretty impressive
for uh it was very creative creative
movie i like
um but you have to you have to still
have to fast forward through all the
scene-setting scenes
you know when i when i come to a movie
if i'm watching it on my ipad and i'm
alone and you get to the part where
two people are showing how much they
love each other
like it might be you know same sex and
they're just best friends or something
but you get to see that you know that
really tender moments when they show
each other's love to each other
fast forward
i i don't really need to see
half a minute
of these two characters loving each
other i'm like i got it uh yeah two
those love each other got it got it
moved to the plot
i got it i got it and they love each
other i got it i got that in five
seconds
got it
move on
that's how i watch a movie now every
every time the scene is one that's gonna
be five minutes of really five seconds
fast forward
well here's another thing that i'm going
to claim some rightness on even though i
was totally wrong about ukraine
being invaded by russia in the first
place so that one doesn't go away from
my permanent record however
uh nato secretary general jens
stoltenberg
i guess yesterday today expressed hope
that ukraine will prevail against russia
as moscow's military events appears to
be stalling
so
so now important people are saying out
loud
that ukraine
looks like they have a good chance of
just winning the war
just already winning the law
[Music]
now
am i the rightest person in the world
about this
can anybody give me the name of anybody
let's say who does this for a living you
know people who talk in the public
domain
is there anybody you saw
anybody besides me
who said that ukraine would give them a
fair fight
anybody
but i'm sure there were a lot of
individuals but was there anybody
willing to say it
i think i'm the only person who was dumb
enough to say in public
malcolm nance but when did he say
bill barr on ben shapiro or are you
saying you like that show
yeah i care
i i think i i think i own that one i
believe so we still don't know if
ukraine will
well at this point let me ask you
at this point
would you say as of today
just rev forget any opinion you've ever
had before
forget all of your prior opinions if you
could
start today
is ukraine going to prevail in
maintaining themselves as a
essentially the same country
yes or no will ukraine prevail
as of today
looking at your comments i'm seeing uh
more yeses than those but less knows
and i think a no is a reasonable
you're still reasonable if you're saying
no
i i disagree with no but you are not
unreasonable with that opinion
yes without the east maybe
uh define prevail prevail means that
they're effectively still ukraine but
they may have lost some border territory
or not so whether or not they move loose
in border territory
that's not the question the question is
is it still ukraine
essentially
it looks i think yes i think they're
going to stay a country it looks like
so
that's what's going on let me see if
there's any headline that i would talk
about i'm not going to talk about this
shooter
[Music]
you know my idea
is there anything to say about yet
another match here
like i just don't i don't feel that i
should talk about it so
with your permission that's just not a
story for me
i mean it's obviously the story but
we're not going to give any more
attention
all right um
oh and everybody's gonna be talking
about free speech now johnny depp is
back
it was a video of johnny depp acting
really bad and slamming cabinets and
stuff uh
amber heard is testifying on the
infamous defecation allegation
well i've got a feeling that we're gonna
see some bad stuff about
johnny depp come out
wouldn't you say
yes amber turd uh it's gonna have some
bad stuff
so i don't think that either of them are
angels
but
um the video that she showed the one i
saw this morning so amber turd took some
you know secret video
of johnny depp being all mad at
something
and so the point of the video was to say
that he's like this angry guy who
punches cabinets and if he punches
cabinets well maybe he punches people
now
let me ask you
do you nobody who violently destroys
inanimate objects but would never hurt a
person
or an animal do you know anybody like
that
anybody
anybody who has a track record of
destroying inanimate objects
yet interestingly has no history of
hitting people
for any reason except self-defense
right
that's not that unusual
it's not that unusual but the video in
which johnny depp was in their kitchen
apparently and slamming cabinets and i
think he might have broken one
did you hear what he was saying
while he was doing that breaking of the
cabinets
he was saying that something happened to
him that morning that did not happen to
her in other words she did something
that morning pretty terrible
i think or something terrible happened
to him that had nothing to do with her
that's possible too
but it looked like she had done
something so horrible
he was in that mood and there was
something she caused
we didn't hear what the horrible thing
was but i think we will
we might
all right
um
so this baby formula thing
uh is it true that we can't ship in baby
formula from other countries because of
some
uh regulation
is that actually happening because
correct me if i'm wrong if we were to
ship in formula from other countries
we'd have enough
because it's not like
every other country has a shortage
sort of an american shortage because of
our companies that make it
so
uh
fda regulations yeah it's a labeling law
boy you know how long would it take
trump to sign an executive order to make
that go away
ten seconds
now the trouble is
well actually if you made that go away
you'd probably end up killing a bunch of
babies
yeah this is a tough one actually
because it's it's not that the fda does
nothing
but i feel like you'd be safe if they
just tested it
you know tested a couple of the bigger
brands and said okay don't send
everything
but it's okay these specific brands we
we took a weekend to look at them
i feel like they could do that
right they can't do a study in the
weekend but they could look to see if
there's anything in it that looks like a
contaminant i think they could do that
preferably shipped from the eu and not
china yeah except the eu probably got it
from china
all right uh reporter finds that
critical race theory ideas in 39 of the
top 50 medical schools
okay
um
there's a fentanyl awareness group i'm
looking at the fox news website in case
you're wondering where this has come
from there's a fentanyl awareness group
is asking biden to track uh overdose
deaths
which is weird because i thought we
already do that
because i always talk about that number
do we make that up
we don't track it
um
oh
so they won't count in the same way
all right i'm totally in favor of this
let me give my full throated support
uh literally yesterday
i was writing my book that i'm here
trying to write
and one of the things i was writing is
that if you and i've said this many
times
if you're not tracking it you're not
managing it
is that right if you're if you're not
measuring it you're not managing it
because you wouldn't know if you did x
or if you did y
if you change the thing you're trying to
change because you're not measuring it
if you didn't know why anything was
changing you wouldn't know if the thing
you're doing is making a difference
so
a good general rule is if you can't
measure it or you're not measuring it
you're not managing it
so if if this group is asking for
fentanyl to be reported and measured the
same way
that's a smart idea
because what is it that is so
frustrating about the fentanyl question
other than you know the obvious
what's frustrating is it doesn't look
like the government's doing something
does it
i i didn't by the way i said the same
thing about trump
trump talked about it and he asked china
to do something but nothing happened
literally nothing
so
you know we're not securing the border
we're not making china do anything
differently
nothing there's literally nothing being
done
so that's an unmanaged problem are you
surprised that something is not being
managed when it's not being measured and
reported in the way that important
things are
now was the was the pandemic unmanaged
no it was not
because we reported the piss out of it
didn't we
and the more you reported it the more
the
more the government had to only work on
that because that's what was getting
reported
so in many ways the media
has to
take some responsibility here because if
the media had treated fentanyl the way
it treats
cobalt
we'd probably be measuring it and
managing it by now
but you know the the press treats it as
a
you know another thing that's like all
the other things
it's like well more people died from
this defensive opening
it's no real story it's just more people
dying
and more isn't the story
the story is usually something different
happening not just more of the same
it feels like i'm on a boat yeah i'm
right by the ocean
so yes um let me say without knowing
anything about this story
that if we're not reporting fentanyl
deaths on the front page of
fox news and cnn
we're probably not we're probably not
managing it
oh this is the coolest thing somebody
asked me what's on my wrist
so it's been a while since i vacationed
at least in america
and
this is the greatest innovation for
being at a hotel
so this opens my door
and it's waterproof
so i can swim with it
now do you know how much pain in the ass
i've had trying to keep my little
uh door opening card
it's the worst thing i'm always losing
it
i probably de-magnetize one of those
door opening hotel cars
one out of three times that i travel
i probably put it in the wrong pocket
with my phone and demagnetize it
probably one out of three times
and then you get to your room you can't
it's just it's just the most annoying
thing about a hotel
is the stupid room card
done
and in fact it's so uh
it's so unobtrusive that i didn't
realize i still had it on and i slept
with it apparently
evidently
it's great
um let's see what cnn say in case
there's anything interesting
i doubt it
so
uh
yeah the shooter plans to shoot more
people blah blah blah sweden and nato
getting in obviously sweden and finland
getting into nato
but it doesn't look like
you know that alone is going to bother
russia
all right um
let me tell you the funniest exchange i
had on
twitter today
and it was regarding uh tucker carlson
so there was a user called savin
and
he was saying that uh tucker carlson you
know spits out conspiracy theories
and so i i responded to him
saying that tucker carlson spits out
conspiracy theories
i mentioned this you know i said is it
more than cnn
so i just wondered what his baseline was
if he's complaining about um tucker
carlson
creating
these um
conspiracy theories
does he think that cnn doesn't do it and
so
he responded
what has cnn done that has encouraged
bigotry and or mass shootings
were they too careful regarding coven
yes is that worse than bigotry
so yes that's a good question
what has cnn done that has encouraged
bigotry and or mass shootings
what have they done
well
there was the find people hopes there
was the drinking bleachers
there was a russia collusion hopes there
was a covington kid hoax there was the
russians paying bounties on american
soldiers
hoaxes
there was a car in the house that we
should go on
should i go on covington kids yes yes
um
and so
now not all those would of course
encourage uh a mass shooting but
likewise not everything that uh cn that
fox news says would encourage any mass
shootings
now
what exactly did tucker carlson say
allegedly that encourage and mass is
shooting
can anybody give me say
a quote
some kind of indication
that tucker carlson would be in favor of
mass shootings or even accidentally said
something that would encourage it can
somebody give me an example of that
because there's no example of
that
there's no example of that
no he has a strong opinion about
you know america first
and you can hate that or you could love
it
but it's completely transparent he's not
hiding anything
there's no go shoot anybody of that
that's just a perfectly
you know i'd say typical i'm not going
to say i agree with it or disagree with
it
it's just a typical opinion
and
none of that should cause anybody to
shoot anybody
so
um and i thought it was fascinating that
somebody could at this point
would not know that cnn is primarily a
hoax generating entity
how do you not know that
oh no jetblue is launching a hostile
takeover for spirit air
uh
so that's interesting
i always thought the spirit was a bad
name for an airline
because the thing that people are afraid
of with airlines is crashes
and you know and basically you turn from
a corporeal being into a spirit
and i'm not sure that was the best
brandon
um
let's say
there have been 201 mass shootings in
2022.
so
do you call it a mass shooting if it's a
like a drive-by
spraying of a crowd that's a mass
shooting right
how many of the 200
how many of the 200 were
of the mass shootings were caused by
white supremacists
what do you think
um it took cnn anchors over three
minutes to list all the u.s cities that
had mass shootings this year
and
uh but since all the news is about this
white supremacist guy allegedly
[Music]
um shouldn't we know of the 200 mass
shootings
how many of them were white supremacists
they don't count gang shootings
um
scott ritter on youtube yeah i've
checked out scott reader on youtube
i don't think anybody knows what's
happening there
they count gangs down
yeah
inflation's fixed
uh there's not much to talk about with
inflation because there's just more of
it
um
the thing here's the thing that
makes me crazy about
what's happening right now
you so we've had this long
debate about socialism versus capitalism
in this country right
is it my
uh imagination
or is the effect of everything that's
happening more socialism
that's that's the net effect right
um
inflation
should
is basically
taken by
my wealth down by a third maybe
what would you say so i'd say that
poor people are still poor
right so if you don't have much income
there's not not much lower you can go
you know you're scraping by
but if you're rich your
your wealth may have gone down by a
third or a half depending on what
business you're in
and that should vastly
you know close the gap so if you raise
taxes
on the reg you close the gap it gets you
closer to socialism a little bit
if you increase inflation
who who gets inflation hit the most it's
two different answers
who it hurts the most is the poor
right no doubt about that but the pain
is at the poor but in terms of
where the money disappears
more money disappears where there's more
money
so the the wealthy would you know shrink
by a third
the the poor would have more pain but
there's not there's nothing there to
shrink it's hardly any money
so
in a weird way it seems like everything
we're doing has this
similar follow-the-money effect
that it's a way to
keep the poor fed
and make them more dependent on the
government giving them direct direct
money
so basically the pandemic was a bunch of
money taken from rich people and given
to poor people
which i favor because you know you have
to keep everybody alive
you know
um maybe the way we did it could have
been a lot better i'm sure that's true
but
i don't object to the fact that rich
people were tapped
to give a little extra money
to keep people alive in this country you
know nobody's going to complain about
that
um
now when i say rich people were tapped
that's not exactly what happened because
we just you know created money out of
nothing and spent
but who pays for the who pays for the
inflation who pays for the higher taxes
who pays the deficit down
it's people who have money
right
poor people don't pay anything i mean
relatively speaking
so rich people are going to shoulder the
burden of all the inflation
well let's say 95
and
uh all the higher taxes 95
etc now i'm not complaining
uh i you know i'm i'm explaining
i'm explaining
that it appears that the biden
administration has found a stealthy way
to turn us into a socialist country
that's what it looks like
uh scott more poor are being created by
inflation
yes
yes so i'm not saying that more poor
people aren't created
i'm saying just again this is just a
math question it's not even an opinion
this is math
that the rich people have the money so
if somebody's going to pay taxes that
it's got to be from them
right that's where the money comes from
so again i'm not saying it's good or bad
or anything that's just what's happening
and
it's funny that we don't talk about it
that way
you you would expect that at least fox
news would be saying
that we turned into a socialist country
because or at least more of what we've
always had a lot of socialism
um
over where we want to be somebody says i
have my car my stocks my golf membership
none of this affected me what do you
mean you have stocks and you were
affected by the market downturn
i think you mean you're holding your
stocks
which would be actually
that would be a good a good opinion
so
um
i haven't looked at my stocks
normally i would look at my portfolio
every day
but i i've literally not opened the app
i have no idea what my
net worth is i don't know what i don't
know
and i'm not gonna look
i'm not gonna look until the headlines
say something like
the stocks are starting to reach their
old their old highs
then i'll start looking again
because if the the
the practice of investing
here's a little tip for you
i don't think you've ever heard it in
quite these terms mostly if you studied
economics maybe you did
but
the act of investing
is primarily about
managing your own psychology
you got that it's a little bit about
knowing what to invest in
but that's not hard because you could
just put it in a index fund and and be
done just walk away so it's not hard to
know what to invest in just diversify
you get a low cost
you know fund that tracks you know big
basket stocks and that's it
so knowing what to buy is easy
knowing when to buy it
is hard
knowing when to sell it or if to sell it
is hard because those are questions of
psychology
so investment
is not about knowing what to invest in
that's easy
unless you're dominant you're trying to
you know guess on certain companies
that's gambling
so gambling is hard if you're trying to
pick individual companies that will win
that's gambling
so that's hard
but it's easy to invest
just put it in an index fund and walk
away
so how do you manage your psychology
the number one way you do it is by not
looking at it
it took me
50 years to be able to do this for 40
years or something
i i probably couldn't do that
for about 40 years but now again
like i finally finally learned to not
look at it because if you look at it you
know what you're gonna think
oh
 uh i'd better i'd better be selling
this thing right away before it all
disappears
now if you imagine if you made terrible
investments maybe that's true i don't
know but if you if you have an index
fund or a broad basket of stocks
i don't you're you the only way to
measure your own animal instincts is to
not look at it
and you should also be thinking in terms
of the five year
um
a five-year horizon
i i saw a tweet by nivall
recently he said
something like
dear god let me let me have one more
bubble
if you get one more good bubble you know
sort of ride it to what you think is the
top and then sell everything
you know maybe that's your best exit
strategy for retiring give me one more
bubble i just want one more bubble and
then i'll put it all in cash or put it
in my mattress or something
yeah
to state the obvious somebody
somebody very rude
in the comments said i could be dead in
five years
that's
yeah
so in five years i will be almost 70.
so yeah i could easily be dead in five
years
um oh oh
all right i just remembered something
so i'm going to take a a point of
point of privilege something called
point of personal presence i'm gonna i'm
gonna tell you something
that's not for your benefit
and it won't hurt you but
like usually i'm
presenting for you know what i imagine
you would like to hear
i'm going to give you one thing that's
purely selfish
the the man who came up with the name
dilbert for my comic strip which wasn't
me by the way it was suggested by my
ex-boss and co-worker
uh he passed away in february
his name is michael goodwin
i'd like to hear his name
and he was the person who came into my
cubicle that day and saw my drawing of
this character who became dilbert on my
whiteboard and i'd asked people to
suggest names
and he picked up my whiteboard
marker took the cover off they wrote
dilbert
on the board
and i've told this story the story
before
that when he wrote that word on the
board next to the character
i felt myself go down and tunnel
to the future
[Music]
and i could see that that was his actual
name in the future
it wasn't like coming up with a name it
didn't feel like assigning a name it
didn't feel like picking a name
it felt like
it's not just buffalo just hours after
that horror americans experienced at
least two more mass shootings in two
other cities
so far this
what it felt like was i literally went
to the future and saw dilbert as a huge
success
now i can tell you this a thousand times
and you're not going to believe that i
actually had that experience
i swear to i swear on everything holy my
dog
anything you want i actually saw the
future
now not literally i don't mean i
actually time travel
i mean that i saw clearly
that this character would succeed in the
future the name was dilbert it would
always be dilbert
and i was done
from that moment on
i never once imagined it wouldn't work
and the odds were
something like ten thousand one
so the odds were ten thousand to one
roughly that's actually a real real
number of succeeding you know in this
business
and
that's right
well
i'm not sure i'm not sure that wanting
and deciding
works in the case of cartooning because
other people have to make decisions
so other people have to say we like it
and we'll put it somewhere so i don't
have full control of that so that the
wanting versus deciding thing
uh works when you do have the full
control right so you could decide for
example
to build yourself up to enter a
weightlifting contest
and you know you just push hard enough
you could probably make that happen
but with cartooning you really have to
depend on luck and that there was
somebody out there who would support you
who liked what you're doing and that
part you can't control
uh i wonder if there are any other
dilberts there are there are people
named gilbert yeah and um uh
dilbert ground loop was an aviator
cartoon
it wasn't called dilbert ground loop was
it i think it was just called dilbert
and there in the navy there's a thing
called the dilbert dunker
has anybody heard of that the dilbert
dunker
uh it's been around since at least world
war ii
and the idea was that uh navy aviators
uh would have a risk of you know
crashing and being underwater in their
plane
and the pilots would have to figure out
how to get out of their cockpit while
they're submerged in the water and they
created a
something to test it it was called the
dilbert dunker
and the reason it was a dilbert dunker
is that dilbert was a cartoon that was
done by the military somebody in the
military osborne i think was his name
the author
and he had a little character named
dilbert and dilbert did all the wrong
things that an aviator should not do
right so he made all the mistakes and
that's how they taught people not to
make those mistakes
now when my boss suggested the name
he did not remember at the time that he
had seen it before
as a comic
the worst possible situation i could be
it because i had already submitted it
you know it had been accepted as a
syndicated comic and then only then
did he sheepishly come in and tell me he
knows where the name came from in his
own mind
because years ago he'd seen in his
father's uh old trunk of
things from you know his father died in
world war ii
uh a trunk of materials from he saw like
the actual dilbert comic and he realized
he must have seen it before
that moment on i said to myself oh no
oh no
uh i'm gonna get a suit
because i'm using the same name and it's
a comic if it had been the name of a
diner like a dilbert diner that would
have been okay
a different business
but it was also a comic
so
for years
i would worry that somebody was going to
come after me because it was too late to
change it
but it didn't happen
and it never did
and i finally figured out after 30 years
i figured out why
do you know why
the original cartoonist
who created dilbert or his family do you
know why they never even
never even contacted me ever
somebody says copyright expired somebody
said trademark was dead
uh yeah so you got it it was a it was a
government cartoon
i already owned it
so did you
if you're an american you owned that
cartoon
nobody owned it because it was you know
it was government property basically
so there was nobody
he made it under contract to the
military
i already owned it so did you
so apparently there was no risk at all
and i never came back to the market
but i would like to tell you one more
story maybe more
uh from the life of michael j goodwin
two i'm gonna give you two stories
number one
michael j goodwin taught me politics
he taught me the only coherent political
opinion i've ever heard
because he used to vote even in all the
local elections he voted in all the
elections he was very republican
and i used to ask him why do you bother
doing that like do you even know what
the issues are and he said no
[Music]
you know do you read all the the ballot
initiatives and do you really know the
ins and outs of why it's a good idea he
said no
and i said but you vote
he goes yes they go how the hell do you
vote
in any rational way without knowing what
all of these things do
and then he told me the smartest thing
i've ever heard in politics
he said i vote against everything that
raises my taxes or costs money
because they already have enough money
and i heard that and said well that's
real ridiculous
that's so crazy
god
damn it
that's the best political opinion i've
ever heard
i've never heard a better political
opinion
and he implemented it like like he would
actually go vote and he would just say
all right raises taxes no
doesn't raise taxes just a statement man
okay yes
what's that
actually i don't know if he voted for
anything i think he just voted against
anything that cost money
and
now you could argue
that hey
there's exceptions there are things you
really need money for to which he would
say sure just use the money you have
i'll bet you got something you could
save some money on
because he thought the government should
operate just like you do
if you don't have enough money for the
new thing
you have to spend less money on the old
thing
that's it just like every company every
every household everybody else in the
world makes do with what they have they
don't just say give me some more
interest and money they just make do
so that was his philosophy
i don't know if it was a good one or a
bad one but it's the cleanest one i've
ever heard of
now let me i'm going to close on my
favorite michael j goodwin
um
story
he was working with me
when i worked in a laboratory
and part we were always connecting
different equipment with cables and to
see if this equipment works with this
equipment you know do the protocols work
etc
and so mostly we're just testing
different configurations of equipment
and that required tools
so we had a little tool drawer that
would be the screwdrivers and stuff that
we'd use for connecting equipment
but there was a discussion in the lab
there were just a handful of us who
worked there
about whether that drawer should be used
for the tools
or the screwdrivers mostly the
screwdrivers
uh or the snacks
because we also kept some snacks in
there
and so we're laying that drawer should
be the tool door or the snacks and so i
thought i was pretty funny
and i said well this question boils down
to this
would you rather screw or eat
and i thought okay that's pretty fun
right screwdrivers versus stacks would
you rather screw or read and i thought i
nailed it
i i thought i'd i like to drop the mic
it's like would you rather screw it drop
the mic walk away
and then michael goodwin
said the funniest thing i've ever heard
after i said would you rather screw the
need he sat there and he said
depends how hungry i am
and with that one sentence
michael goodwin
described all of human nature
there was nothing left
there was no
corner left unexplored
there was no phenomenon left
to be understood
michael j goodwin
magnificent bastard
had described all of human nature with
one sentence
depends how hungry i am
and so this man not only
gave us the name for denver
which i believe changed the world
i do
because if gilbert didn't have that name
i'm not even sure if it would have
worked
honestly there's something about the
name that gave it
wait
am i right
could you imagine the deliberate comic
with any other name
it's hard to do isn't it there's
something about that name that makes it
work
it is
now because of that
that allowed me to have some
um exposure
it allowed me to talk about politics
you saw with your own eyes if you've
been watching
that i got some things done
[Music]
for example during the pandemic i
recommended
an executive order to drop the
doctors couldn't make a phone call to
help you across the state border which
was done
and so i recommended that during the
pandemic and the president at the time
signed an executive order and now tell
them telehealth is a way bigger market
should make a huge difference in
people's lives eventually
now that's just one thing
there's there are other things that i
managed to accomplish that i can't tell
you about
this is the good ones
but trust me
well that could be another example my
book uh how to fill in almost everything
is still win big it introduced the ideas
of you know systems are better than
goals
and talent stacks
now i don't think it's bragging
to say that those two things made a huge
difference in the world because i hear
about it all the time
you know talent stacks is the way
smart people recommend anybody prepare
their career now
and the systems are better than goals
pretty much has been adopted as the
standard way of
thinking of stuff
none of that would have happened
without michael goodwin
so not only did he have the cleanest
political opinion i've ever heard i vote
against everything that raises my taxes
he summed up all of human nature
with one sentence depends how hungry i
am
he named dilbert
which basically caused a chain of
chain of action
that brings us to this moment
so
i just had to honor him for that
so you took his ideas
he he gave me his ideas
and
[Music]
all right so yes let's have a step to
michael jane goodwin
go
and that is my show for the day youtube
i'll see you tomorrow
