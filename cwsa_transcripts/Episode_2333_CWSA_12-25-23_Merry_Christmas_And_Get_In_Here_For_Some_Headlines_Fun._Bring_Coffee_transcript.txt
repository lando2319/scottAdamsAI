jingle bells jingle bells jingle
bells good morning everybody and Merry
Christmas and happy New Year a little
bit early well if you'd like your
experience today to go up to levels that
even Santa Claus couldn't understand all
you need for that is a CER of mugger a
glass a tanker chel ay a Cen Jer mask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and en
join me now for the unparal little
pleasure the dope of me of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and happens
now
go it's too early for
eggnog much do
early well should I read the news in a
funny and not too serious way all right
all right we don't want to get too
serious today do we well before we start
I should uh call your attention to the
Dilbert reborn comic available to local
subscribers and also subscribers on
X um and I just want to let you know the
theme you might know that Mickey Mouse
came off copyright but not the total
Mickey Mouse not the modern version only
the version that's 95 years old there's
a black and white Mickey Mouse Steamboat
Willie so in honor of him coming off of
copyright I have him visiting Dilbert's
boss so that's black and white Mickey so
I have to draw them in black and white
even though the comic is
color so Mickey says hi my name is
Mickey and the boss says G get out of
here and Mickey says settle down my
copyright expired I'm a free Mouse
Disney can't sue you and the boss
says then Mickey says can I get a job
here or do you discriminate against
black and white characters and the boss
says that's a gray
area yeah it's a it's a dad
joke but a solid one I think
solid while the New York Post is
reporting there was a man who was
arrested because he used a laser pointer
he was pointing at a commercial plane
then at a police helicopter now as you
know the laser pointers can blind the uh
pilot so that's very illegal so they
they arrested him but the part of the
story that they didn't report is they
took his laser pointer away from him and
they shipped it to zalinski in
Ukraine because it's all we had
left we didn't have anything left we're
like well we've got this laser pointer
we took off that guy I'll take
it okay you don't like your ukra
Ukrainian humor early in the
morning well here's a story that is
developing I think we can see where it's
heading I told you that uh terer Carlson
suggests that he has information we
don't have and that he believes that
aliens or some kind of entity that's not
human uh may have always been here as
opposed to visiting from another planet
might even have a uh a spiritual
Dimension so he thinks maybe he could be
here here could be in the oceans could
have always been here hiding in
Antarctica maybe I don't know but then
there's this related story that says
scientists are uh they think they can
decode whale language so they might be
able to use AI to decode the complexity
of the whale sounds and figure out their
language
yeah so uh and then they think that if
they could learn whale language it might
teach them how to make a univ IAL
Communicator so that AI could someday
allow us to communicate with
aliens have you put it all together
yet have you connected the
dots
yeah uh I think the cats on the roof
they're trying to slowly break it to
us that whales are
aliens and they might have
ships now you've got to have some good
technology to C A whales ass around in a
spaceship but apparently they have the
good stuff anti-gravity so yeah whales
are aliens and uh they may have already
decided to conquer us
because I don't know if you know the
history of humans in
Wales but I swear I hope the whales
don't know it because they're going to
be really
pissed have you heard of a whale
oil don't ask don't
ask all right
right um I'm so
old that you know how things change and
when you think back what you used to
think was true you're like oh my God how
do we think that was true when we were
kids so dumb here's some of the things I
believed oh probably two years
ago two years ago I thought maybe we had
too much population on the planet so
population growth was a problem
and I thought we had a shortage of
lithium but Elon mosque has set a
straight we have two few people we need
more or else the economy will collapse
and as he uh he posted yesterday I think
um lithium is one of the most common
elements on
Earth building lithium refineries is the
hard part that's what we need but
lithium's
everywhere how many of you were in the
same boat that just a few years ago you
thought we had too too many people and
not enough lithium but turns out we have
unlimited lithium and not enough
people is there anything we know that's
true the the most the most basic things
you thought you knew about reality nope
totally opposite not enough people
plenty of
lithium how many of you saw the most
bizarre interview ever of ker Carlson
interviewing Kevin spacy but Kevin spacy
did it within with the character the
political character he played in that
long running Netflix series whose name I
can't remember but he played a kind of a
dirty politician so he did the whole
interview in
character now you might say to yourself
Kevin spy I thought he got Meed or he
got blamed for some terrible sex crimes
with with men
and you weren't there multiple claims
and how in the world is he being
rehabilitated I I thought he was a goner
House of Cs was the name of the show
yeah he was on House of
Cs um but it turns out that uh now this
is just what I see on the xplatform I'll
need to I'll need a fact check because
I'm not positive this is true is it true
that there were four accusers of Kevin
spacy I think they were all male and uh
three of them died
suspiciously so those cases went away
and one of them dropped the
charges is that true that three out of
the four people accusing him died
suspiciously and one dropped the
charges I don't know if that's true it
feels it feels too like on the nose or
something right that couldn't be true
all right I'm I'm going to say I don't
quite believe it yet but I'll I'll say
it's a it's the story on social media
I'm not sure I believe it I'm going to
need a little more convincing on that
one a better Source I guess
um but uh there's also a
report that the uh there's a partial
Epstein flight list is that real because
I saw a few accounts that seem to show
as they seem to be showing lists of
people who went to AB Island but I don't
know if those are real they were
supposed to be released about now but I
don't want to mention anybody on it
because it looks like it might be
 is it real does anybody know do
we actually have the
list it's fake so the so that list that
we're seeing is one that's been out for
years which we don't know if it
necessarily matches the real list right
okay so we're going to call that one BS
however on the BS low
credibility you shouldn't believe it
list is Kevin spy's
name now here's what you should look at
look for if we should ever confirm that
we know who flew with him look for
people who
are uh let's say famous
celebrities who are unusually
politically
active that's what I'd be looking for
all right but we have to wait to make
sure that it's a real list so we don't
know if Kevin spacy was ever on anything
like that that would be a
rumor
um there's a story that there's a a big
rise in threats to public officials can
you believe
it can you believe that our elected
officials are getting more death threats
than
ever is that because the public got
worse
I don't think
so yeah maybe there's a
reason well one of my favorite uh comics
of all time was I can't even remember
the the cartoonist I don't think the
cartoon runs anymore it was a single p
panel comic and I showed a guy in jail
and he was talking to his bunk mate and
he had you know scratched a bunch of
scratches on the wall and he was
counting up and he was talking about his
own experience and the Prisoner says 19
arrests 19 convictions maybe it's
me and I've been laughing about that for
like 40 years maybe it's me 19 arrest 19
convictions starting to think the
problems on my
side so yeah there are more death
threats of public figures is that
because the public got worse
or is there an unmistakable pattern of
bad behavior that would certainly
suggest there would be more death
threats I'm going to go with the latter
I I feel like we know too much about
government now we're like a little bit
smarter our eyes are a little bit more
opened and maybe they're worse maybe
they're worse in there would have been
but I would certainly expect more death
threats given our current situation not
that I encourage them I don't encourage
that so don't make any death threats but
if the government is wondering why there
are so many maybe they should examine
their own behavior maybe you consider
all
possibilities well uh so a interesting
and provocative post by Naval
rant and uh he has a way of saying
things in a very succinct way and he
said this Argentina may prove that you
can vote your way out of
poverty because and they showed some
stats of South American countries and
their poverty levels and it is very
clear that it's a political problem and
not a resource problem you you can see
that when the political leadership
changes the economy just either goes in
the toilet or or does well and it seems
to be one to one so Argentina has their
new Pro IST
president he was doing a lot of stuff
and cutting departments and stuff I
would bet on Argentina
recovering I would say the smart money
says Argentina is going to go well and
here's the thing sometimes it's just
about energy so the new president of
Argentina brings in this reformist
energy which makes people say oh I'm
optimistic now because of all that
reformist energy oh he did something in
the news that looks like a big deal he
got got rid of some departments or
something oh reformist energy so then
because there's reformist energy people
create their own energy and that becomes
a
self-fulfilling uh issue so it will be
partly what he does the new president
but partly how people feel about it and
apparently people are feeling good about
it so good news from Argentina which may
may be spread to other places well zero
Hedges
reporting that uh what is becoming
evident is that the
NGS the non-government organizations now
these will be organizations that usually
rich people have funded but are not
directly controlled by anybody's
government so they're like little
governments but non-government because
there's some rich person allowing them
to do what they do rich people usually
and apparently these NOS are now well
known to be the organizers of the mass
IM immigration that's happening in
America and probably elsewhere so it's
organized it's not
just that they made it um let's say
comfortable for people who were going to
immigrate anyway they actually created
an entire Travel network to inform
people how to go and then help them
immigrate from everywhere in the
world now this had nothing to do with
the American government but has a
gigantic impact on the health of the
United
States so it's not a
country they're non-government
organizations it might be people from
different countries in some
cases now how should we respond to
that well if it's just a non-government
organization doing legal stuff and I
guess it's all legal in fact you can
find out you can get their documents you
can find their maps you can find out
their whole plans and they're doing
exactly what I said they've created a a
whole platform to make it easy for
people to leave where they are and end
up in America and and
survive now my first problem with that
is the
following one of the things I've always
liked about American illegal
immigration and even legal immigration
is that it was hard to get to America it
was hard to get in Legally you had to be
qualified and know how to jump through
all the Hoops you had be able to afford
a plane ticket depending where you're
coming from so the people we would get
are people who cross a very high bar
they could figure out how to get here
they could go through all the the
complications to do it and they were
high enough educated quality that the
country said oh yeah we we like people
like
you but what happens and then also for
the people coming over the southern
border they were unusually risk-taking
people because they didn't necessarily
know how they were going to make it work
I like those people but here's the
problem what happens if it's so easy
it's just easier to leave than it is to
stay now you've reversed
it if it's if it's easier to stay than
it is to leave you've got a natural
filter so you get all the risk-taking
high quality people who can you know do
this difficult thing of getting here now
you make it so easy and where you are is
so bad that the laziest lowest qualified
people say hey I might as well get on
this bus it's free might take me
somewhere better so didn't we just
reverse the best thing about
immigration that it got us the people
who could pass the filter and now the
filter is reversed and we're getting the
people who couldn't who couldn't make it
in their own country and probably can't
make it as easily in our country country
as the people who had a harder time
getting past the
filter so that's bad but I'd like to add
this following thought uh is there a
reason we can't kill the NGO leaders
under the rules of
War wouldn't we just have to declare
this an illegal Invasion and part of a
war and then we could kill them couldn't
we now I don't think we should just just
go murder the people in the NGS that
would be kind of crazy I'm not saying
that I'm saying we should create a legal
process in which we designate the NOS as
terrorist
organizations because they seem to be
working diligently for the destruction
of United States what would you call
that well you'd say Well they're not
doing anything violent and I would say
they're shipping in uh military aged
people that we don't
know how does that not end up with more
violence than the there would have been
if if they hadn't done it of course
there are so I would say we should at
least examine uh designated the NOS as
terrorist organizations or paramilitary
or military supporting or funding of
terrorists or something like that and
then we should give them warning plenty
of warning because you don't want to
kill anybody you don't need to kill sayl
if you keep organizing these immigrants
we're actually going to kill you
wherever you are in any country wherever
you are you're just going to get mowed
down and we're not going to
apologize because you're ruining our
country
no you don't think we should be able to
murder the heads of the
NOS legally you should be under a legal
umbrella with lots of warning
because America is being
destroyed that's that's not
hyperbole there is some level of
immigration that that guarantees the
destruction of America and the NOS are
heading toward that limit I don't know
if we're there yet I think we're below
that limit but we're heading there as
quickly as possible I say you have to
kill the people behind it but give them
warning and do it under a legal
structure certainly nothing
illegal has anybody ever said
that I don't know how you just let them
do
it so but and whoever funds it probably
should be looked at as
well all right here's something
interesting let's see if we can figure
it out you've heard that there is excess
death rates in the United States but
here's the weird thing so the pandemic
is
over and there's still these excess
death rates so you're going to say oh
it's the vaccination oh it's the this or
that but here's what we
know apparently it's across all
demographics in the United States and
it's is not as severe in
Europe is that enough to tell us what it
is think about it it's all
demographics but not so much in Europe
can we figure it out from there nobody's
figured it out but let's see if we
can so here's what I think it would not
be if it's if it's all demographics I
would say it's not
lifestyle because it wasn't that much of
a lifestyle change that would affect all
the demographics the same so I'm going
to rule out a lifestyle change such as
staying home too much less active Etc um
I don't think the diet
changed I don't think the diet changed
in one year or two did
it well we'll get to vaccines I don't
think diet changed and even if it did
you would see that in some di um some
demographics more than others
because I think we have some
demographics that don't eat the same as
others right I don't think uh seniors
eat the same as young people young
people don't eat the same
as you know so we should have
demographics that are not having the
problem if it's food because it wouldn't
be everything you eat everywhere all the
same time it' be like some element of
the food the food would be bad and you'd
see it in some demographic more than
others so I don't think it's food
I don't think it's anything that affects
all of us all the
time so if it's not our lifestyle and
it's not the food uh what about the co
itself well Europe had Co and we had
covid but Europe is doing better so it's
the same Co so it's probably not Co um
hangover and then your obvious question
is the
vaccinations but I don't know this for
sure but I strongly suggest that the
vaccination status would be the main
thing people are looking at is so
obvious so don't you think that uh we
would know by now if the unvaccinated
were a demographic group that were doing
fine don't you think it if we really
knew that unvaccinated people just
weren't having this excess death rate
wouldn't we know that by now I feel like
we would because it's most obvious thing
you look at right I don't think it's
more sugar because that didn't change
much um so I don't think it's food I
don't think it's big Pharma I don't
think it's just that we got fatter
although we did because that doesn't
happen fast
enough what do you think it
is all right I've got two
hypotheses that I don't have a lot of
confidence in but the fact that it's
across all
demographics that's the that's the
sketchy part here's what I
think number one it's a data collection
problem so either Europe is doing a bad
job of collecting death data or the US
changed their mechanism or is doing a
better job or a different job so if I
had to guess the fact that it's across
all demographics and it doesn't affect
Europe as much that strongly suggests
the data is just wrong that we maybe we
changed the way we collect it or
something like
that
yeah so here's one
possibility it's a bad data
collection say some kind of change that
affected all the way everybody does it
maybe um but I feel like we'd know that
don't you think we'd know that by
now don't you think somebody would would
have said hey the data collection
changed I feel like that would have
bubbled up so probably not that but
there is one thing that affects uh all
people in
America in a way that doesn't affect
Europe what is it what is something that
does seem unique to
America that's not affecting Europe as
much as
much
lonliness
lonliness now that's a
hypothesis that Europe has a different
culture and may simply be more social is
that true would you say that that Europe
is simply more
social I don't know if that's true but
if they
are that would explain it because we we
do have a uh we have a loneliness
problem in the United States and it's
the only thing I can think of that is
across all demographic
Graphics every demographic is lonelier
now our our shutdown in the pandemic
apparently made a big difference to our
permanent habits so another story in the
news is that people are not using their
cars as much we have the same number we
actually had more cars than we had
before the pandemic so the number of
cars went up but the miles driven Drop
Like a
Rock do you think that miles driven
dropping like a rock is entirely work
related because some of it is so a lot
of people are working at home so that
increases your loneliness you have more
you know the technology is better all
the times that increases your options uh
humans are worth less to each other I
think it's
loneliness and the depression that comes
with
it anybody want
to offer another
alternative what what do you think it is
um is it Pharma
food
obesity
data
vaccination dehydration alcohol well
well Americans oh relative that so I
think Americans are drinking way
less or actually maybe the ones who are
drinking are drinking
more but there are few people drinking
at all and more people quitting so
they're less social all right let me ask
you this
question uh of all of you you
ready uh do we have a problem here
locals looks like the
locals comments are having a problem so
I'm going to open up the locals comments
on my other device that usually
works all right just a
moment
where am
I hold on just a
second there we go all right yes I have
your comments now on my other device can
you see me I think you can see me but
the comments are delayed all right so I
got all your comments now
uh there was a change in in
data media scops yeah
maybe yep yep hey John you're kind of an
 I just want to tell you that for
Christmas guy named
John you're a total
 thanks thanks for
joining quitting alcohol is the best
thing you you've done for yourself
good all
right well we've already ruled out the
vaccination because I think that would
have been
noticed yeah I don't know if it's
depression but uh let me here's the
question I was going to ask let me look
at the comments the question is this how
many of you have uh increased
loneliness since before the pandemic how
many of you have increased in
loneliness all right I'm saying lots of
nose but there are lots of
yeses I
know oh my God sorry about
that yeah some people got
widowed uh yep so some of is re yeah
loneliness and retirement and all that
other stuff okay oh we got our comments
back well that's my guess all right
here's a Sam Olman prediction so he was
bragging about his prediction he said 27
months ago he made the following
prediction uh he said that by
2030 so now just six years away it will
become clear that the AI Revolution and
renewable plus nuclear energy are going
to get us there which is near zero cost
for intelligence and
energy near zero so what Sam alman's
talking about is I think Fusion made
some breakthroughs and there are a lot
of uh you know Green energy
breakthroughs and now you have the AI
breakthrough which He suggests um he and
he said in a a comment that at some
point ch GPT will be
free uh except for the newest
version so you'll be able to get like a
a really really useful free one but if
you want the really really useful one
maybe that's connected to more services
or something you you'd play pay a few
bucks a month so at some point most
people will have free
AI just think about that free
AI it won't be the best you can buy but
you know for 20 bucks a month you
probably get that
too and then um we're heading towards
free
energy so the answer to your question
what do you do about uh a national debt
that is so high you can't even imagine
any scenario in which it would be paid
back free energy would get you
there if energy approached to free then
the cost of all products would drop and
suddenly
L everything gets fixed so it is a once
in a civilization
change only once in all of human
civilization will energy costs go from
real expensive to almost three only once
it will never happen again but only once
have we run up debt that looks
impossible to pay
off luckily it happened at the same
time one of the things that makes me
think we're in a simulation like how
could that be how could it be a
coincidence that the one time you have a
crushing impossible to pay off debt you
have a once in a ever in history of the
universe ever this you know onetime
change in energy prices kind of Lucky
may we got
lucky all right
um yeah people are staying home more
blah blah so Wall Street Journal says
that kids are preferring YouTube to all
other forms of
entertainment I'm going to uh Echo that
although I'm no kid have have all of you
noticed that if you turn on YouTube
you'll find something very interesting
to watch every single time have you ever
noticed that it works every time if I
have some free time and I open up
YouTube no question about it there are
going to be 5 to 10 things that is
suggest all of which interest
me now go anywhere
else right x x actually works that way
when I go on X I'm always entertained
it's really really strange if I don't
have a entertaining time on
X but if I open Netflix what are my
percentage odds
not that good maybe one and three that
I'll find something I want to watch at
most one and
four and that's the same for all the
streaming
services at one point I just signed up
for all the streaming services like I
just had every one of them and I could
not find anything to
watch um
but once I got uh the Youtube premium
service where there's no
commercials I always always have
something fun to watch YouTube is just
killing everything else there's there's
no and and here's
why I don't want to spend a whole bunch
of time looking for what I want to watch
and Netflix is a is just a nightmare and
if you have more than one streaming
service you can't remember where you
stop watching One Thing how many time
have you ever done this if you have more
than one streaming service you'll watch
a show and you watch a few episodes you
say hey this will be my new thing I'll
watch the rest of these and then you
can't remember which streaming service
it was on and then you get frustrated
because you looking for it and it's not
in the first three you try and then you
just give up and you never watch it
again yeah it's not just me fairly it's
not just
me yeah I give up on most of the things
I try to watch even when I like them
because I can't figure out where the
next episode is and it frustrates me
because I sit down and if I spend if I
spend 10 minutes looking for something
to watch I'm going to give up I'm
literally just going to change my mind
and say well that was my 10 minutes I
didn't have half an hour I had 10
minutes and I spent the whole time
looking for something but you go to
Amazon it's like oh yeah or not Amazon
but YouTube oh there it is bang and and
also a lot of the content is 10 minutes
so I can see 10 minutes of something
from beginning to end without looking
for it there's no competition YouTube is
just going to own
everything well apparently there's an
Egypt plan for solving the Gaza
situation uh in which they do a uh in
Broad
terms uh they would end the war with
Israel and Hamas with a ceasefire a f
hostage release and then the creation of
a Palestinian government of experts who
would administer to the Gaza Strip and
occupied West Bank so the the plan would
include a different kind of government
for the West Bank in addition to Gaza
which is probably
important you know having Gaza different
than the West Bank gave you two problems
you know wouldn't it be nice to have one
um and the proposal worked out with the
Gulf of nations of cutter has been
presented blah blah blah uh but it falls
short of Israel's goal of crushing Hamas
so we don't think it'll
happen um it's good that they're talking
about it now yesterday there was a brief
social media bit that I can't find it in
the news so I think it's not true that
Saudi Arabia had a plan for uh
administering the West Bank in Gaza is
that true or not true
did anybody see a story about that it
was briefly on social media but I didn't
see a source I think it's not true but
I'm going to I'm going to double down
and say that the smartest thing that
Saudi Arabia could do is offer to
administer the
region uh with with Israel in charge of
all the
security because it would make Saudi
Arabia the adult in the room and it
would position them in the strongest
position not only to oppose Iran because
remember Iran wanted to Scuttle the uh
the growing closeness between Saudi and
Israel and the other countries so it
really was about thwarting is a Saudi
from becoming more integrated with
Israel and the West so the best way you
could defeat Iran's intentions and
hamas's intentions is to make sure that
when as soon as you're done
the other countries they were trying to
stop getting together or not just
getting together but more getting
together than they ever were
contemplating before so that there's a
real it really didn't work you got to
make sure that Iran thinks oh crap that
didn't work right so it's they're not
tempted to do it again
so I think uh
maybe maybe a Saudi involvement would be
the right
answer uh but I don't see any kind of
answer where the Palestinians
are are governing themselves I just
don't see it now as someone pointed out
to me this morning um you have all these
brainwashed young people in the West
Bank and Gaza how in the world do you
fix that an entire youth group
completely brainwashed to just want to
you know kill Israelis and Jews and
whatever can you fix it I'm going to
give give you a weird optimistic answer
to that
question number one here's here's number
one persuasion rule you need to know it
is way easier to brainwash a young
person old people can be brainwashed but
it takes more work because they're more
settled in their opinions you really
have to unsettle their opinion before
you can change it young people are
starting with no real opinion and
certainly not strongly held so you can
brainwash them easily you you can make
them believe in Santa Claus anything
right so that's what happened so now
you've got this all this weaponized you
know million or so young people who are
weaponized so how in the world do you
solve that well I don't know if it's
solvable but you could imagine a
scenario in which let's say Saudi or
somebody else uh had control of all of
the education system so somebody had
real tight control of the curriculum and
what the teachers were telling the
kids then you just reprogram them now
you'd have to get the 20 somethings
because they're already out of school
but you can get them so here's the good
news remember I told you it's simple to
brainwash young
people it's really simple to
un-brainwash
them because you know what do you know
it's easy to convince a young person
there's nothing easier to convince a
20-some or a teenager than the following
statement you ready for this when I tell
you how easy it is you're going to laugh
it's the easiest unb brainwashing you'll
ever do you ready here it
comes the adults were lying to
you that's
it that's
it and you're done you just have to
explain what they lied to you about and
that's it
yeah young young people especially
men all right let let's put this to the
men all right because it's the men who
are doing the fighting for the most part
so we'll just say to the
men don't you think you could be easily
convinced that your adult you know your
elders have been lying to you all along
about anything about anything just pick
a topic and I tell you your your elders
were lying to you do you think I could
sell that to young people it's the
easiest thing there's nothing easier
they're already primed for it it's easy
to convince somebody of something
they're already primed it to believe so
if you already believed in ghosts it
would be really easy to tell you that I
saw one and you'd believe it but if you
didn't believe in ghosts well good luck
right I'm not really going to convince
you I saw one if you don't believe
they're real but young
people specifically young men are all
ready to believe that everybody's lying
to them it's the single most believable
thing when you're a young male that
you've been lied to so you just take
that approach you don't say oh here's a
better way you say no they were all
illegitimate you know those Hamas
leaders that were in charge of your
education before they all became
billionaire iones what yeah they all
became billionaires it was never real it
was just a plot to brainwash you do you
know how long it would take to
un-brainwash a young person under those
conditions a a reasonable person comes
in and said you know I hate to tell you
it was all an OP they were just
brainwashing you so that they could get
billions of dollars in power and really
most of what they told you wasn't even
true a young person
you can flip them in 10
minutes so if you're thinking oh there
no there's no way you can un-brainwash
all those young people 10 minutes 10
minutes yep you can un-brainwash every
one of them now can you brain
un-brainwash their parents uh good luck
good luck with that that's going to be
harder way way harder but the kids the
20s somethings yeah you can get every
one of them every one of
them all right
uh Bill Amman still going hard at the
president of Harvard who refused to quit
and I guess there's the board refused to
fire but now he says bill akman says I
have heard from a source that is
reliable but a step or two removed from
the situation that the Harvard
Corporation has asked president gate to
resign and she has
refused
uh who could have seen this coming I
wonder what she did instead of agreeing
to
resign huh does it involve hiring a
lawyer uh and then the source said that
she hired a lawyer and she's going to
sue
okay a little bit
Dependable a little bit Dependable
now let me ask you
this if you were a white
man and you thought where should I go to
you go get a job did you really have a
chance of getting a job as president of
Harvard this latest time you really
didn't did
you yeah do you think you should stay
away from situations in which you have a
natural
disadvantage and try to find situations
where you have some kind of natural
Advantage I
would so I wouldn't go anywhere where
you're in physical danger or where other
people have a Competitive Edge against
you in
hiring I wouldn't go any of those two
places I guess I wouldn't have been
canceled if I said
that but that's basically what I
said
basically all right uh the polls are
saying according to the hill they looked
at a whole bunch of polls 57 polls and
they found out Trump is leading by over
2% against Biden now that's remember
that's 2% in the general
election and Republicans win elections
without winning the general you know the
the general vote they just have to win
in the key
States so that would suggest that Trump
probably has like an overwhelming
advantage in winning the election
because because if he's at two points
ahead in the general that would be
better than
basically any Republican has done since
Reagan give me give me a history fact
check when was the last time if ever a
republican won the election and also won
the popular
vote when's the last time oh was a
bush
no George Bush
did George Bush Jr win the popular
vote bush in
04 all right well it does
happen but so far it has accurately
predicted you know anywhere that a
republican won the popular vote they
also won the election right is that
right let's let's check that every time
the Republican won the popular vote they
also won the election
true and won it
handily if they won the popular vote
they didn't just win the election they
won it like really pop they wanted by a
lot right I think that's
true so we have a situation that
guarantees Civil
War because either Trump wins and the
bad guys create a civil war to stop it
or Trump
loses and his supporters start a civil
war because it looks
rigged it's hard to avoid the Civil War
this time isn't it now I'm using
hyperbole I don't think they'll be a
Civil War I don't think there's a civil
war either way I think we just complain
a lot and do what we can in courts like
always so you know that weight loss drug
that's a big deal you get the injections
I think OIC is one but there are others
in the same category and apparently they
really really work and people lose
weight but believe it or not this is the
conversation that's
happening whether or not these shots
should be considered a lifetime
treatment because apparently as soon as
people take stop taking the shots
two-thirds of them gain back all the
weight in the
year 2/3 so the medical community is
debating whether it should be treated
like
diabetes which is once you have it you
have it so it's lifetime you know like a
high blood pressure once you you have it
you have it so you just always take the
blood pressure
pills
now is everybody okay with
that isn't there something wrong with
this uh reasoning by
analogy all right so it's permanent for
diabetes and
hypertension now obviously if you're if
you somehow showed as non-diabetic or
you somehow showed as no longer having
hypertension they'd stop
but generally speaking the assumption is
you're just doing it
forever isn't that different than
eating because I'm most positive people
can eat less like
by you know if they could eat less if if
you lost a bunch of weight with
OIC and then you got off it so your
hunger came back it's not impossible for
you to find another way to stop eating
is it like a
diet you know the way everybody else
does it
now I don't I don't do fat shaming
because I don't believe in free will but
since it's a real thing that people can
keep weight off with own drugs shouldn't
you always take them off it after a year
am I wrong about that I would think that
100% of the time You' say I'm going to
do this for let's say two years I'm
going to do this for two years and then
we're absolutely taking you off the
drug now if two years later it looks
like you couldn't handle it we'll talk
about putting you back on but we're
going to have to take you off it to see
if you have any chance at all of
maintaining your weight shouldn't that
be the rule that you're guaranteed to
get off it but we'll watch it and if you
know if you can't figure out how to do
it on your own we'll have to put you
back on because the drug itself can't be
completely safe is
it
anyway um
so there's a there's a movement now
there's a book by uh let's see book by
Jones somebody named Jones who was
talking about the white supremacy
founding of the country and wants to
remind us that the original exploration
of the uh at least of white people by
the Americas was super super
racist which I didn't actually know so
here's something maybe you didn't know
um this author
uh talks about the doctrine of Discovery
so back in 1493 back in Columbus days um
the uh Pope put out a doctrine of
discovery that said any land not
inhabited by Christians was available to
be quote discovered claimed and
exploited by the Christian
rulers did you know that did you know
that the Christians believed that
if they found land that wasn't run by
Christians they could conquer it because
they were Christians what's that sound
like this that sounds a little bit like
the radical
Islamic thing going on right now all
right so the Catholic faith and
Christian religions uh could be exalted
and spread everywhere because we were
the good ones I guess uh and it became
the basis of All European claims in the
Americas that it was basically a
Christian
Christian right basically to take over
anything that wasn't already
Christian that that sounds worse than
anything I've heard America do
yet that's pretty
bad yeah
boy um was it uh I think I saw V
ramaswami saying that you know he sort
of understands why people want to tear
down statues of slave owners
right you might not agree with it but
it's not without an argument it's not
without an argument slave owner you know
is that the message we want to send but
as V says why don't we replace him with
people who were the opposite of slave
owners and he mentioned two people in
particular uh President John Adams and
President John Quincy Adams who
apparently were not slave owners and
worked very
hard against the evil slavery so we do
have presidents in the same era as the
slave owners who are working very hard
on the opposite side of things to try to
free free slaves and give them legal
representation and everything else so
why not build a statute to my
relatives how about that huh didn't see
that coming my cousins the Adams
presidents I just assume I'm related
some somewhere down the
line I'm not descended from them but I
might be a cousin of some
kind well uh Michael shellenberger has a
fascinating again uh article about how
the color Revolution methods that our
government has used in other
countries uh they used it against
America to defeat Trump so the color
Revolution is when you do a bunch of
nonviolent things which collectively
destabilize the country so could be
processs in the street it could be
lawfare you it could be anything that's
legal but would destabilize a country
that's the color
Revolution and as Michael shellenberger
points out uh the Democrats had
previously proposed in both 2016 and
2020
um no hold on uh as his publication
public reported I'll just read what he
said uh on Wednesday political
operatives and journalists these are
Americans held a summit called the
transition Integrity project or the tip
in 2020 right so now a bunch of
important Democrats got together and in
2020 and during that they did simulated
exercises in which the players plotted
how to challenge the election results in
the event of a trump
Victory just think about that Trump is
maybe going to go to jail or not be on
the ballot for challenging an
election and the Democrats were planning
to challenge him if he won even if it
was a legal Victory they were planning
to challenge it and we know that it's
documented the exact thing they're
they're blaming him of they were
planning to
do very much planning it I mean really
really planning it all right
here and here's the punchline in one of
their simulations they had States send
alternate slates of of
electors that's right they actually did
uh roleplay in uh war games in which
they did what Trump tried to do with the
alternate
electors and then when Trump did it
instead of
them they tried to put him in jail for
it so the very thing that they War
that they were going to
do as soon as Trump did it and by the
way they tried to do it in earlier
elections as well so it was a very
common thing they they actually got
their IL illegitimate media to sell it
as an Insurrection so they could put
Trump in jail the very thing that they
knew was legal because they' done it
before and so legal that they even War
gamed it and documented it as a a thing
to do
amazing and then uh Michael shenberger
says the Democrats quote Insurrection
narrative rests on manipulative
arguments and cynical language games and
this narrative has being used to destroy
a foundation of her democracy the right
to vote for the candidate of your
choice
now this is a case of everything is
exactly as bad and rotten as you thought
it was it it it couldn't be more of a
worst case scenario and apparently it's
all documented it's as true as
anything's ever been true it's all
documented let me say it
again Trump will not be kept out of the
election he will not be
jailed and he will not be prevented from
running do you know why because that's
too
far that's just too far
there there is a
line and in case Democrats are wondering
where the line is there might be other
lines but that's definitely a
line yeah if you keep him from winning
using a
trick I can't predict what happens after
that I I never suggest violence of
course but things are going to get real
unpredictable if that were to happen so
I almost can guarantee you it won't
happen because the risk that Democrats
would be putting themselves to would
actually be existential that would be an
existential risk meaning the whole thing
could fall
apart yeah so I don't think that's going
to happen because I think nobody would
take that kind of risk but Democrats
might be thinking they're fighting for
their lives you know there might be
somebody well lots of people so crooked
that they fear a trump presidency
because he might actually put the crooks
in jail and they're going to have to act
in a way that's like trying to protect
their own life so I do hope his security
service is up to the
job all
right I saw a uh a post by Mike covich
said the Energy felt bad and he was
feeling a sort of a
negative you know Cloud coming I don't
feel
it I actually feel like um we're in an
Awakening and that the Awakening will be
bumpy and you know won't be easy but
that is where we had to go so what I
feel is a huge destabilization and I
think maybe that's what Mike is feeling
there there's a level of
destabilization that I've never seen
before we're definitely destabilized and
things are definitely going to change
but here's my my uh being too American
part if there's one thing that Americans
are good at consistently good at and
nothing's changed like we're we're still
those same
people we're really good at breaking our
 and then fixing
it breaking is the hard part sometimes
you got to break it or else you know you
can't build it back we're we're we're
experiencing a great breaking
meaning that everything we were doing
before stopped
working right everything everything
everything that used to
work just stop working so we had to wait
until it broke before we could really
fix it and and had to push it a little
bit too and now you're seeing things
breaking everywhere remember Dei and the
ESG stuff it was just sort of rolling
along and we had to break it before it
could be put back together in a better
way so yeah I I see a whole bunch of
things that were just sort of rolling
along that now just have to be
broken uh I feel Far and Away more
positive forces than negative forces are
forming that's my feeling just hch
but I think you can feel good this
Christmas
I think you can feel good to me it feels
like Ukraine is winding down because it
has to I think uh Israel did what it
needed to do and the S the the situation
that was in Israel was
unsustainable it had to
break but first you had first something
terrible had to happen before you could
do the extreme thing needed to do to
maybe get something stable this was it
it was an extreme thing nobody wanted it
to happen but it did so now they have a
chance of building something stable
maybe with Saudi or somebody else having
some role we'll
see but I see two Wars that are likely
to wind down I don't see a war with
China starting I see China on the
decline I see Russia sort of should stay
kind of stable once Ukraine winds
down
and energy trending toward free and AI
is coming and robots are going to save
us I don't know I see a lot of positives
now keep your eye on
Argentina because uh naval's comment is
is way deeper than you think it is
because he says it so succinctly but if
Argentina quote proves you can vote
yourself out of
poverty that might change
everything might change everything if if
uh by election day Argentina has already
started to turn
around I think Trump gets elected easily
don't you don't you think Argentina is a
referendum on Trump it's also a
referendum on V because V has ideas that
are that seem as uh let's say bold I'm
going to say bold as as
Argentina
my cable management is yeah it is I do
have table I I have terrible Cable
Management you're
true
yeah it's not bad enough yet maybe I
think it
is no way someone stole your cat last
year and you just received a box with
your cat in it that did not happen are
you serious somebody sold your cat and
they gave it back to you on
Christmas did that really
happen I want to see if that's really
happened probably a different
cat yeah we're asking if it was dead or
alive
it was
alive
huh you're worried about V because he's
too
charismatic you know that is the problem
with smart people and one of the things
that Trump does best is he acts less
smart than he is have you ever noticed
that one of one of Trump's greatest
magic tricks is to convince you he's not
as smart as he is because then you feel
comfortable with him V has the other
problem he's so obviously smarter than
all of us that you wonder if he's got a
trick up his sleeve right there's an
automatic distrust for smart people Bill
Gates has this now I'm not going to
defend Bill Gates he can defend himself
but I'm saying that even if he hadd
never done anything wrong and I'm not
saying that I'm just saying if he never
done anything wrong it's hard to trust
him because he's too smart I think Elon
Musk has that problem too that if if you
don't like what he's
doing you worry because he's too smart
too smart is scary to most people so you
need to be too smart but also clearly
empathetic so the thing that VI has to
do is make sure that he's communicated
his empathy with the same power as his
capability if he gets his capability
higher than his empathy he looks like a
monster if he gets his empathy up to the
level of his capability it's called
Charisma do you get that that's a very
important Point by the way let me say it
again because it's so important if his
capability is higher than his empathy
he'll look like a monster because he's
capable of doing anything but you're not
sure he's on your team because he
doesn't have the empathy but if he gets
his empathy to the same level as his
capability which is extraordinary you're
going to say to yourself oh we can't
have anybody else he he will
become
uh he will
become what's the word just
guaranteed if his
empathy and I don't think it does yet by
the way the reason the reason you're
afraid of him is that he doesn't hasn't
done it yet his empathy has not achieved
the same level of his capability but not
because he doesn't have
empathy it's exactly because his
capabilties so high it's really
hard to get that much empathy even if
you have plenty of empathy because he's
just operating at such a high
level if he gets it there and he could
easily because it's more of a
communication thing than a real thing if
he just tweaks his communication to get
his empathy to the same level is Magic
have you seen the viral videos of a v um
I'm going to say turning a Critic in the
audience I've seen two of them so far I
think there might be more but in both
cases the way he turned his critic was
he said I'll give you the microphone and
let you
talk and let and let his critic fully
express everything and then where he
could find places of agreement he would
agree
strongly and then without losing any
empathy he would tell you why his
version actually shows the most empathy
and once he had done that because the
person had talked themselves out in both
both cases they realized that he was
coming from a place of empathy not a
place of uh technical you know
Republicans like this it was actually
derived from an empathy position now
that's not obvious it's not obvious that
all of AES policies are empathy based
it's just that he thinks capitalism
fixes your problem better than Socialism
or communism and he thinks you know the
truth works better than a lie right so
he's definitely has an empathy
first um approach it's just that he
knows he have to go through a certain
path to get to the best outcome and not
everybody knows that so he he looks a
little off model because people are not
as smart as he is about how you get to
the best
place but given his level of uh
capability could he ever bring his his
perceived empathy because it's
perception his perceived empathy to to
up to his actual
empathy where his capability is if he
does that he goes
supernova supernova now I would say
that's what Trump gets
right one of the things that makes Trump
so popular is that his empathy for
regular Americans is through the roof
would you agree I've never seen anybody
more consistently and here's here's the
key
genuinely Trump is full of about a
lot of stuff but if he's if he doesn't
genuinely have empathy for the let's say
middle class of
America uh that would be the
greatest trick ever because he looks
completely consistent everything he does
in person every little act of kindness
every word he picks every policy he
picks they all seem to be consistent
with a genuine empathy for Americans
like ordinary Americans so I think I
think when the Democrats pick up what
they call the cult do you know what the
cult is he showed
empathy that's it they called him a
cult because he showed genuine empathy
like the real kind like I think it's
real
and believe me I'll be the first one to
tell you Trump is a showman I'll be the
first person to say he uses hyper the
first person to tell you doesn't pass
all the fact checks no no argument about
any of that but he is completely sold me
after decades and Decades of total
consistency the average
Americans he really
loves and also the other thing he sells
me on is I love his pirate ship
I call this supporters a pirate ship
because it's all these you know a whole
lot of nar wells and you know
controversial characters people who've
had brushes with the law you know just
really
edgy kind of out there people he
Embraces all of them as long as they're
on his side and America's side he
Embraces all of them and uh I like
it what I see with the Democrats is that
they only embrace the politically
popular oh Trans are very important
let's bring in some trans because
they're getting a lot of publicity Trump
brings in the people who didn't get any
publicity right yeah Middle Middle
America is not getting a lot of
publicity but that's the ones he caters
to so I think V can take a lesson from
the master Trump trump actually in my
opinion this it's pure opinion I believe
he lowered his perceived capability You
by talking in a plain simple way uh you
know the he says stuff like if the wind
stops blowing your windmill won't work
and you can't watch TV now nobody thinks
that's really true I
hope but it's just a simple way to say
what he wants to say which is the Green
Technology is overrated basically um but
if aake were to say the same thing he's
going to give you the really compelling
smart I understand this topic from top
to bottom explanation and then you're
going to say whoa his capability is way
up here where's his empathy his empathy
is an a whack right so he's so smart and
so good his perceived capability got on
a whack with his perceived empathy but
the reality is they're probably the same
all he has to do is put him back in
Balance so Trump lowers his perceived
capability
has an a tremendous perceived empathy
for regular Americans and they match
what happens when those two match your
capability and your empathy if it's high
capability
Charisma that's what gets you a
cult he you don't get a cult by being
good at what you do let me say this a
thousand times you do not get a cult to
following for being good at what you do
nobody does it's not a thing you get a
cult following for having
empathy that matches your high level of
capability period there's no other way
to get there now let's look at the
president of
Argentina
capability looks pretty high high level
of capability but
empathy president of Argentina tell me
tell me your impression of his
empathy high it's high because he's he's
going going after the Elites for the
benefit of the regular people and he
spent enough time you know being a
interesting wild man that you think he
actually cares about people and he's so
diverse you know he just sort of a a
character who's done a lot of things
that you believe he actually really
cares about regular
people and then he does high capability
things
whoa High empathy High
capability magic magic
so
V is one twist
away from
Magic Trump has magic uh mil president
milu I don't want to say his name
because I me m in Argentina he has magic
empathy and capability matched V still
an
awack but he's under whack for exactly
the best
reason not for lack of capability his
capability is too high it's on a whack
with anybody's level of empathy how do
you get how does anybody how could you
possibly have that much empathy because
he's got to get up to that level of
capability if he doesn't which he could
do he could absolutely do it but the
moment he does it you know it's going to
be a moment if it happens it's going to
be a moment in American history because
it's going to be
fireworks like you've never seen
oh damn it I was trying to trigger the
platform but it didn't work all right
let me uh check in on locals and see if
everybody's still good
there all
right well okay well here's here's a
very honest statement all right this is
a comment I want to say from who people
aren't quite sure whether to trust an
Indian yet now I hate to say it but
that's
true that not my opinion obviously but I
do think there's a a
racial uh
discomfort that people don't like to say
out loud but it's a trust thing but if I
could make a one
correction um he's an
American he's not an
Indian he's literally not an
Indian he's an American with you know
Indian
Heritage but you can't get you can't get
more American than
V yeah he's he's like 110% American he's
more American than Americans he's the
one who reminds you how to be an
American that's like the most American
you could
be he's not a Hindu oh some people think
he's a Hindu he's not a
Hindu he's a
Christian he's a
Christian wait I'm I'm saying smart
people saying he is a
Hindu now this is
interesting
you you're telling me he's a Hindu who
believes in the
Christian he's a Hindu who believes that
Jesus Christ was the son of God that's a
Christian let me ask you this do you
think V believes in heaven
or uh
reincarnation does he believe in because
I think you're talking you I think he
might be culturally he comes from a
Hindu
background I think you're you're
confusing his religion with his
culture is that what you're doing I I
think actually all of you are
wrong I think you're all wrong
actually you want to check let's check
on this for the next time okay should we
check on it
now let's check on it
now let's do this in real time so here
here's what I think I think he
identifies with the Hindu
tradition and culture another words an
influence but that his belief of
uh religious belief is
Christian so we we can check it right
now if I'm wrong I if I'm wrong you get
to see it in real time does anybody want
to stay and see if I'm
wrong it'll be fun don't you like to see
me
wrong all right we'll find out the
answer to the question and I'll say
is uh
V Christian or
Hindu what do you think
uh he said
uh he said I'm Hindu and I'm proud of
that I stand for that without an
apology
uh but
wait hold on so remember I said I didn't
disagree that he identified as
Hindu but we're talking about his
religious belief
right we're talking about his religious
belief so let let's get into this
religious
belief
[Music]
uh all right let's see better
answer
shares the same
values how do we get a good answer for
this New York
Times don't believe that don't want to I
a news Nation I'm g go with news Nation
because I'm trying to find a unbiased
Source wait we might have an unbiased
Source here
to Jenny Mitchell she is an entomologist
at Iowa State University from Boon Iowa
she is a republican who is currently
undecided Jenny all right listen thank
you thanks for being here and thanks for
coming to Iowa so much we appreciate
your visits uh so freedom of religion is
a part of our Constitution and obviously
a huge part of our country what do you
say to those who say that you cannot be
our president because your religion is
not what our founding fathers based our
country on I would say that I
respectfully disagree and you know I
want people to understand this about me
I would rather speak the truth and lose
an election than to win by playing some
political Snakes and Ladders I mean if I
want to map out my political career and
really solve for that you know I could
fake convert you know I'm not going to
do that I'm G to tell you about my faith
I'm Hindu now I went to Christian
Schools I went to St Xavier in
Cincinnati and I actually have been on
the board of STX except for Hiatus to
run for president and I can tell you
with confidence that we share the same
value set in common I'll tell you about
my faith my faith teaches me that God
puts each of us here for a purpose one
God that we have a moral duty to realize
that purpose one God that God works
through Us in different ways but we're
still equal because God resides in each
of us now I had what you would call not
a traditional upbringing but probably a
very traditional upbringing right my
parents taught me family is the
foundation marriage is sacred divorce
isn't some option you just prefer off a
menu when things don't go your way
abstinence before marriage is the way to
go adultery is wrong that the good
things in life involve a
sacrifice now are those foreign values
in this country I know it could look
that way at times you turn on the
television go to the movie theater your
local Dei training at a company or with
they're teaching your kidss in schools
that could seem a little
unfamiliar I don't think it's unfamiliar
to most of us I think those are the same
judeo Christian values that I learned at
St X when we get to the Ten Commandments
what do they say there's one true God
don't take his name in vain observe the
sabbath respect your parents don't kill
don't lie don't cheat don't steal don't
commit adultery don't
covet that's when it hit me we share the
same value set in common
there's another Core teaching in my
faith which is that we don't get to
choose who God works
through God chooses who God works
through so we get to that Old Testament
a little bit further along we get to the
book of Isaiah I don't know if many of
you're familiar with with that
one God chose
Cyrus a gentile all the way in
Persia to lead the Jewish people back to
the promised land and so yes I believe
God put us here for a purpose
my faith is what leads me on this
journey to run for president my
gratitude to this country is what leads
me and even when we think about the
founding fathers I'm a fan of History
okay I talked about Thomas Jefferson
earlier we'll stick to Thomas Jefferson
he was a deist actually let's be honest
about because the left wants to rewrite
our history and tell he was a slave
owner an evil man no IET that but we're
not gonna have anybody rewriting our
history thas Jefferson was a theist he
made the Jefferson Bible you know how he
did it he didn't believe in all the
parts of the new Testament but he took a
blade razor blade by hand glued it
together and that made the Jefferson
Bible which we have today John Adams
wrote letters to Thomas Jefferson
actually became something of a Hindu
scholar after he left and so I think
it's important to see our founding
fathers three-dimensionally not the way
that they've been Rewritten post 1990
either and so yes do I would I be the
best president to spread Christianity
through this country I would not I'd be
not the best choice for that but I also
don't think that that's the job of the
US
president but will I stand for the
judeo-christian values that this nation
was founded on that I was raised in even
in the Hindu Faith yes I will You're
darn right I will and as a young person
picking up on that strand from earlier I
think it's my
responsibility to make faith and
patriotism and family and hard
work cool again in this country I think
they're pretty cool and I think that's
my job as your next president and to
back to the First Amendment we will
stand for Rel religious liberty in a way
that neither Republicans nor Democrats
actually have that's what the First
Amendment says you get to practice your
faith every Pastor in this country gets
to do his job without the government
getting in their way that's what I'm
going to keep as
the so so here's my interpretation see
if it matches
yours that he believes there's one
God what does he believe about Jesus
because that would be kind of
I was just looking to see what he thinks
about
Jesus um betting on
momes let's
see who is Jesus to the
Hindus I think they see him as a
teacher well I guess that would be the
main
question
huh what do Hindus say about
Jesus he's a
ayra is a light in the world or
something do hindos believe in the
Bible interesting so what would be the
difference between someone who thought
there was one
God and believed all the Christian
values but you but was a Hindu by uh
self
label so here here's what I think you
need to
ask does he believe uh any of the Hindu
specific beliefs such as
reincarnation isn't that a key thing if
he believes there's one
God and you go to an
afterlife but the Bible might not be
literal that's that's closer to a that's
pretty close to Trump
religion it's kind of better than I
thought it
was um I'm more comfortable knowing that
he's compatible with Christian religion
without being a True Believer to me
that's the ultimate that be the best
situation
so uh so I will accept your statement
that he's identifies as Hindu can we
agree on
that can we agree that uh he identifies
as
Hindu would you also agree that he does
not identify at least out loud with the
things the Hindus believe such as
reincarnation or don't they have
multiple
gods wait how many gods do the Hindus
have how many
gods let's get a number on that
33 uh how many gods
33 so he believes there's one God which
says all the time all right now let me
ask you
this using his own words to describe
himself he is compatible with all of the
um Christian Concepts and he believes
there's one God and he agrees with
Thomas Jefferson that the Bible uh is
human
made so is Thomas Jefferson a
Christian was Thomas Jefferson
because I don't think he believed Jesus
was the son of God you know that
right I'm pretty sure Jefferson didn't
believe in Jesus did
he he was a de not a Jesus
Lover what about
Washington all right so this is more
interesting than I thought it's actually
better than I thought
I would have been
uncomfortable if he said he was um Hindu
and believed the the specifics of 33
gods and
reincarnation I would be equally
uncomfortable if he said he was a
Christian and believed everything in the
Bible was literally true sort of a Mike
Johnson thing that doesn't make me
comfortable at
all but if you say you believe in one
God like most of the American who
believe in anything do uh and you say
you're completely 100% on board with the
cultural you know aspects of
Christianity that's sort of the ideal
situation for a
president I don't think you could do
better for better now that might it
might make him hard to be elected so
that's a separate issue but I Want a
President Who says I like all the good
parts of your religion but it's up to
you
how much you believe about the
historical details but I like all the I
like what it says so let's let's deal
with what it
says because we all like that part and
then you individually can argue about
the historical
part he attended church so we know he
believed in God he just didn't believe
that the Bible was the work of God
that's why he kept some parts and threw
away other parts
all right so I wouldn't say that he's I
would not call
v
um what would you say a classic Hindu or
a classic
Christian but he's he's hit a mix that's
pretty
appealing I think you found a sweet spot
there now it doesn't mean it's makes it
easy to get elected just in my opinion
it would be the perfect place to to
be
if you're a deist you automatically
don't believe in Jesus right is that
right give me a fact check on
that de believe there's one supreme god
which uh excludes Jesus being a like a
godl situation
right no or true I get a little
disagreement on that I would think aest
is just there's a God and that's the end
of the story there's no
Jesus yeah so that they would not
believe that Jesus necessarily is
God so you can believe in Jesus but not
believe that Jesus is God you could
believe he's the son of God but not
God okay all right well there's some
wiggle room there all right well I'm
glad we've sorted that all
out but I will I will take your
correction are you listening to this
part this is part you wanted to hear I I
accept your correction on the Hindu part
but it's not if if you'll accept my
definition that he's not a classic
Hindu to me he sounds more culturally
Hindu and belief wise is he's a lot
closer to the Christian model so I'm
going to say I was 25% right and 75%
wrong will you accept
that I grade myself 25% right but 75%
wrong which means you're 75% right and
I'm 25 and you know do you accept
that all right we have
agreement I call it a Christmas
miracle it's a Christmas miracle all
right everybody go have a great
Christmas enjoy your families I hope
some of your families were watching
and uh I might have another live stream
tonight I don't know yet but I probably
will talk to you later bye for
now
