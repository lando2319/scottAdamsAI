hold on a technical problem on Twitter

post not sense
looks like people are joining
we've got a I've got an error condition
on Twitter
which I call X
but it doesn't seem to be affecting the
live stream so we're going to go with it
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
after a long three-day weekend here in
America
we're ready to go
ready to go I don't know if you know
this but all all work
happens between
September and first part of November
and then
January to late March
you knew that right
all the rest of the year is kind of just
waiting for those periods
everything else is waiting for somebody
to come back from vacation
but if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody's
ever dreamed or possible all you need is
a cup of mug or a glass attacker Chelsea
Stein a canteen
Geographic kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day
thing makes everything better it's
called simultaneous sip
it happens now go
oh
yup it's time to get serious the kids
are back in school the weather's not as
good as it was before although I like it
better
yeah
time to get serious
speaking of serious
do you remember the Canadian shop
teacher who had the enormous
uh
prosthetic breasts
well apparently you said teacher is
going back to school and presenting no
longer no longer presenting female but
is presenting a male a male look
but you know what the funniest part
about the story is
it's a story there was a story in the
Toronto Sun
showing
the teacher in the full uh Prosthetics
that we were used to seeing and then
showing the same teacher dressed as an
unambiguous male presentation yeah I'm
not talking about what's in the mind but
in terms of the you know outside
and through the entire article wait for
it
the entire article is about this
individual
clearly presenting now as male
as the teacher did prior to the event
and through the entire article
the teacher was referred to as she
[Laughter]
that's right
now that's the prank I assume it was a
prank right I think he was just making a
political Point even after having made
the point
I think
I think
they still can't get off
they're still still stuck in the prank
that they don't know that it's time to
change the program
now I love the fact that he didn't make
the rules
if he sticks with it and continues to
dress the way he apparently currently is
which is a male presentation
and insists on being called a woman
I'm just going to love him twice as much
or her or her I don't want to get that
wrong
it would be the best
but that might be coming we don't know
what said Canadian shop teacher is
thinking
but I sure hope she is thinking that to
to look to just go on with his life
being called to her and just let it let
it ride
it would be wonderful
well Jill Biden has coveted I saw Tim
Poole ask if this is sort of the
beginning of the hint of the cats on the
roof of the well you know Joe Biden's
fine yeah don't worry that Joe Biden's
been tested he's fine but the person who
spends a lot of time with him has this
covert thing and you know a man that age
a little bit of covid
who's to say he wouldn't come down with
some long covet
I mean if you were to get covered
he might be one of the statistics you
know what I mean one of the people who
gets that long coven and doesn't know
how long it's going to last but it might
be unfair to run for president under
those conditions
nothing's real
literally nothing is real
you know the the most shocking thing
that I say
is that there's no such thing as real
news about public figures
when people first hear that they're like
well that can't be true
like obviously sometimes it's wrong but
you telling me that every time it's a
public figure the news is wrong yes yes
every time
it's at the very least you're leaving
out a key piece of information which you
know could have the effect of making it
wrong so yes even if the thing they
report really happened the news is still
fake because they leave out the
explanatory stuff
do you remember when I got uh canceled
I'm sure you remember that and they
reported what I said
how many people in the Press asked me
why I said it or what the intention was
or why I would say something so
obviously you know out of place
the amount of the entire press it was a
national headline for for days and days
and days weeks actually it was it was
trending for weeks how many of them
asked me why is that
nothing
not not a single one
not even one
isn't that the most obvious question
if that were news
you don't think they would ask me why I
said it
like what's up with that you know why
does this not match anything you've ever
done in the past
nobody asked
on that one thing
the national trending story
I'm a public figure I'm literally the
easiest person in the world to find
you could find me a hundred different
ways
nobody asked nobody not a single part of
the media
no now Chris Cuomo asked but that was in
the context of you know content for the
show
right but nobody asked as a news story
right if you're actually on a show of
course they can ask but if you're not a
guest on the show nobody cared
all right
uh
NBC News had a story today and it
doesn't matter what the story is but
here's one sentence remember this is NBC
all right
you all know the NBC is not real news
right
if you listen to Glenn Greenwald he'll
tell you directly there's just a CIA
organ they're not really yeah or I would
say a Democrat organ at this point
they're not really trying to do the news
so but they have this statement quote
even though House Republicans have not
produced evidence of wrongdoing by Biden
there's no evidence of wrongdoing
now let me be let me be as clear as
possible
had they said
there's no direct evidence of a crime
I would say yeah I think you're right
about that there's plenty of
circumstantial evidence but I'm not even
sure the circumstantial evidence
indicates a crime that Biden himself did
I don't know I'm no lawyer but if they'd
said something you know more more clear
like that I would say well yeah
technically I guess you're right I guess
you're right but no
uh they have not produced evidence of
wrongdoing
now wouldn't wrongdoing include
taking money for things you're not
providing as a service
as in if they're really not giving
anything for these contacts
is that right is it right to take money
for a product you're not delivering
I don't know that would be wrong in a
different way
what about what about lying about it the
whole time is there any wrongdoing about
lying that he had no he had no knowledge
of his kids business
oh never never met with any of those
people
like
yeah I don't know if there was a
technically a law broken but I've never
seen more evidence of wrongdoing in my
life
have you ever seen more evidence now
remember evidence is not approved but
I've never seen more evidence
I mean the evidence seems kind of
overwhelming
but no NBC News nope no evidence or
wrongdoing and if you thought that NBC
News was real news
and you read this
wouldn't you adopt that opinion oh well
NBC says there's no evidence of
wrongdoing so I guess we're done here
yeah if you don't know that the news
stopped being real a long time ago that
would be confusing
if it was ever real I mean there's a
good argument it never was real
um
here's a good rule for you about science
we all love our science right science
being the probably the single best way
to know what's real and true and at
least repeatable that's the closest you
can get to reality is what is
predictable and repeatable
but I think you mean you need to make a
big distinction
between science that is the subject of
headlines
and science that's happening in the lab
and nobody knows about it
now I would like to make a clear
demarcation
science that nobody hears about because
somebody let's say they're testing a
specific hypothesis is not part of a
product it's not related to the
headlines has nothing to do with climate
change it has nothing to do with race
has nothing to do with anything that you
know we debate about every day
I've got a feeling that's pretty good
probably pretty good meaning that they
probably are real scientists who are
doing something real
and getting you know Real Results
sometimes wrong sometimes right but they
you know crawl towards the truth over
time
but is it my imagination if any science
is in the headlines
such as climate change it's always fake
isn't it
is it to say it's just another way to
launder opinion
it is yeah science is just a way to
launder opinion
and I I saw the uh
the the the funniest quote
I'm going to skip ad here I wasn't
planning it but speaking of that so
Anderson Cooper
uh was talking about the new
um
the new ownership of CNN and how Chris
liked or liked or whatever he was you
know I guess he's gone now but Anderson
Cooper was saying that
uh that he wasn't he didn't understand
the whole thing that management wanted
them to do because Anderson Cooper said
he's a he's an anchor he's not an
opinion guy
he's a news guy not an opinion guy
Anderson Cooper
Anderson Cooper said that
like that's a real thing that came out
of his mouth
they he thinks he's a news guy
not an opinion guy
that's everything that's wrong with uh
that's everything that's wrong
with CNN
you say he actually thinks he's a news
guy
so what he gives you his opinions he
thinks he's telling you the news because
he thinks it must be he must think
they're facts I mean I'm just guessing I
can't read his mind but the logical
implication of that is that he thinks
the things he's saying are true
and factual and news
does he really think that
don't you wonder if he actually really
thinks that or is that just something
you said
because you know people say things they
don't believe
but could he actually believe that
he's a news guy and not an opinion again
now this is one of the reasons I've
always had more respect for Fox News
if you ask Hannity are you an opinion
guy or a news guy I'm pretty sure he'd
say opinion guy
right
Tucker do you think Tucker would say
he's a hard news guy or an opinion guy I
think he'd say opinion
right and I you could pretty much go
down the line you get to Brett Bear and
you say are you an opinion guy or a news
guy and say I'm a news guy and then you
say yeah oh yeah well I'm going to check
and then you'd find out he's a news guy
pretty much sticks to the news
so it's just amazing I I can't really
tell
when people are having a mental problem
or when they're just lying
do you think that Anderson Cooper is
unaware
that other people see him as only an
opinion guy really
do you think he knows
because I actually don't know my here's
one of the
the dangerous things about perception I
guess
humans are pretty good
determining uh if somebody's mentally
disrupt
wouldn't you say
humans are pretty good it you know in
person you can't tell online too much
but in person you can kind of tell if
somebody's got a mental disorder you
know if it's one of the kind that is
going to affect their immediate Behavior
so
to me he always looked like he had a
mental disorder
but you know I'm not a doctor and if I
were you'd be telling me you don't
diagnose somebody you don't know I'm
just saying that when I look at his face
when he talks about Trump related stuff
he looks like he's in the actual mental
distress in other words he he projects
it I can't say I know what he's thinking
that would be unfair I'm saying that as
an observer of behavior he presents as a
person with a mental disorder
now I have the same feeling about Bill
Maher
but only when he talks about some Trump
stuff
he seems to be completely mentally
healthy in every other domain but when
he hit that one domain there's something
that happens
I don't know if it's just a personal
problem but it it presents itself as a
mental disorder
TDS specifically it does look like a
mental disorder and I wonder if there's
something like that on the right
or even something like that that I do
where where I look like I'm rational
most of the time but it'll be something
I talk about that you'll say I I think
think you've got a mental disorder there
Scott
foreign
you're going to come out you're going to
throw out some examples of where you
disagree with me on policy that's not
what we're talking about I'm talking
about just being bad crazy
yeah everybody has blind spots everybody
has bias we're not talking about that
I'm talking about bad crazy
all right
um
so
yeah so any any news that's in the
headlines is fake
most of the time
do you think that that's a fair
statement
that science you don't hear about is
probably pretty valid you know over time
not every experiment is going to work
but that if it's in the headlines
there's almost not there's really not
much chances real
you know even the pro and the con are
not really trying to be real
well I think it's a fake
is the first politician
who has made a legitimate attempt
to be honest about the science
and pulling it off
you know maybe other people had it in
their minds that they were trying to do
that but they didn't you know didn't
come off that way he's the only one who
seems to be literally looking at the
science as we understand it and then you
know doing a good job of interpreting it
no I I feel like everybody else was just
nah
climate change is real uh-uh it snowed
today
and and he's just he's dismantling them
you know through uh through a much
better process
all right but he's only dismantling the
agenda just the agenda
all right
um I saw a tweet today because I was
complaining about Free Speech as I often
do we'll talk about
more of that
but uh Frank on Twitter Frank joppy I
think
he said their free speech leaves on the
Second Amendment no one is aware of it
but the USA is is the Second Amendment
it's the not that keeps it all together
to which I said
no it doesn't
are you kidding me
the the Second Amendment Amendment
probably does protect you from the worst
kind of dictator taking over I think
that's true and anybody who makes the
stupid argument that guns don't work
against nuclear weapons and helicopters
doesn't really understand how the guns
would be used because they wouldn't be
used against the military
duh right you know that's not how they
would be used
they were just making it possible for
anybody in charge to ever go outside
again
and people in charge probably want to go
outside
sometime for the rest of their life no
it would just be impossible to show your
face anywhere in America if you were a
dictator because we're just too strapped
somebody would take you out
so
so yeah the Second Amendment is really
good as one of the things that maybe
helps us prevent the dictator takeover
but when it comes to freedom of speech
you lost that a long time ago
who has freedom of speech you know let
me give you let me give you the dumb
argument before I give you the smart
argument okay
dale dale can you explain in your own uh
words why we have total freedom of
speech in America because you can go to
your closet and say anything you want
well that's true I could go in my closet
all by myself and say anything I wanted
but does that does that really seem to
you like that's freedom of speech
nobody says you get to go on a social
media platform I don't believe the
Constitution mentioned your freedom of
using the X platform
yeah we all get that
we all get that 100 of us understand
that
but in a practical sense if you don't
have access to actually the tools of
communicating you don't really have
freedom in the way that other people do
in a practical sense but not a technical
sense not a technical sense because you
can go into your closet
you can say anything you want in the
privacy of your own closet
yeah but you know
that's not really the free speech that
anybody cared about
the only kind people cared about was the
the public stuff well you can say
anything you want on Twitter apparently
there are anti-semites and racists and
everybody so what are you complaining
about you can say anything you want on
there
well yes but then the ADL will ban you
whether whether you say anything bad or
not if they just don't like it
politically because there's essentially
a tool of the Democrats and they're
destroying Free Speech wherever they go
by destroying the economic model of the
people trying to enjoy the free speech
they're not in your closet in Scott you
can say anything you want in there I
feel like you're just avoiding my
argument as opposed to responding to it
do you do you see the fact that while
technically Free Speech exists that in a
practical sense it does not do you get
that
was January 6 people had all the free
speech they wanted
yes you piece of they have
all the free speech they want you
 while they're in jail rotting
for basically Free Speech crimes you
well you don't have to get so personal
about it
freedom of speech
and see
so
yeah we don't have freedom of speech are
you kidding me
does anybody think that we have freedom
of speech in a practical sense you know
don't go all Dale on me oh well
technically it doesn't mean no I know
that I know it technically doesn't
involve Twitter or X or whatever
yeah
all right well you know what I mean
all right so now the Second Amendment
won't protect your freedom of speech
because that's already largely gone what
you have is the freedom to run into a
buzzsaw of economic destruction should
you say something that is not compatible
with the uh the malign Powers such as
the ADL and this BLC blah blah blah most
people
all right
um Glenn gridwald
he tweeted today the top two priorities
of the CIA and the U.S security state is
number one infinitely prolonged the war
in Ukraine to weaken Russia
and two control online political speech
to banish descent
he says the liberal left overwhelmingly
support both
and the and the few that don't are
demonized
now does that feel like an accurate
statement of where we're at
does that seem like hyperbole
it actually doesn't to me that doesn't
feel like hyperbole that feels like an
objective description of the current
situation
yeah
um
but I wonder to what extent Glenn
Greenwald is being targeted by the
entities that don't like he's calling
them out I think they Trust on I think
their trust is that the only people that
see Glenn Greenwald are people who agree
with them already
you know what I mean
if you don't agree with them you
probably never saw this
so who's he talking to
that's all they need to control you
I think I mentioned this by vivaquist
tweeting about it so de Santa says this
100 million dollar monster pack
political political action committee
and apparently they have taken credit
for creating an army of trolls to create
misinformation about the vague
Now isn't that exactly what it seemed
like
didn't it seem like there was this weird
Army of trolls who were all pushing the
same set of uh misinformation
and now a number of you I don't want to
name names but a number of you believe
the trolls and decided he was a w e f
guy Iris oros guy and these are all
ridiculous things ridiculous
but did the did how many of the trolls
convinced you that any of those things
were true is there anybody who was
fooled by the trolls to think they use a
globalist
anybody was anybody fooled by it because
I got a lot of people who came at me
that I think are my regulars
who were completely fooled by that
so here's one right now probably the San
Francisco this is in all caps best
squirrel one two one three which is
totally a real person the basketball one
two one three all in caps Scott wants to
swallow if eggs Tikka roll
so
so that I I think DeSantis is sending
his best
so it's a good job you did a good job
representing your candidate so Ron
DeSantis is going to be quite proud of
you all all capitals
mixing your racism with your food food
ideas all in one tweet pretty good
pretty good are there any more desensis
trolls here
you're funny
yeah you know what I've started doing
is it turns out that the people have
mental disorders
will label themselves on x
if you look for it
am I right
they'll actually put an icon to label
their own mental disorder
and you can even tell which one it is
like you oh it's one of those mental
disorders
all right if you see a Ukraine flag in a
bio what do you know about the person
you know they're not legitimate and sane
now they might be saying and you know
just playing a role
or they might be insane and not know it
but you should not respond to anybody
with a Ukraine flag as if you're in a
conversation with somebody as a
political difference nothing like that's
happening
just look at their responses they will
be completely unhinged
same with the little uh you know the
little ocean thing same with the masks
right say with the pronouns if you see
any of that you're dealing with a mental
disorder
and it has nothing to do with whether
they disagree with you on policy
yeah the syringe
the syringe the Blue Wave yeah they are
so predictive but the you know the one I
use all the time is the artist
when the artists come after me they
usually have artists in their bio and
they'll come after me the hardest
um that's not exactly a mental disorder
that's people in my profession who
didn't do as well
they're all they're all hella mad it's
like can you imagine well let's have
some sympathy for them can we imagine
being an actual artist
and then looking at what made me famous
you don't think that would bother you
I'm literally the least talented artist
in the entire world of art who is not
named Kathy guys white because she she
left the business
but of people are actually still working
I'm by far you know the least talented
in an art sense can you imagine how much
that bothers artists
how about my writing
you know I don't exactly write like
Shakespeare who I mock
um
how would you like to be a writer who
can make like really good you know uh
you know English College course writing
sentences and then you look at my little
sentences and they all look like they're
fourth to sixth grade level
comprehension they're like oh my God
look at this idiot he can't write long
sentences he can't draw
and how did he get famous and I'm such a
good artist
and I'm going nowhere
so those are not exactly mental disorder
that's you know just small people
but the ones with mental disorders
really stand out they do like to label
themselves
well Elon Musk is suing the ADL the
anti-discrimination league
anti-discriminate no Anti-Defamation
League Anti-Defamation
here's a little rule for you anybody who
has anti or Diss in front of their names
is doing the thing that they're anti-ing
or dissing
antifa
antifa are they really anti-fascist
are they
are they
about Anti-Defamation
as the ADL defamed anybody well they the
head of the ADL called me a uh a a
holocaust denier
in public
that's the head of the ADL
the head of the ideal called me
personally just a few weeks ago
anti-semitic and a holocaust denier
um
what about the various entities that try
to be the people who stop disinformation
do you think the people who are stopping
disinformation
are stopping on only the disinformation
they might stop some of that as well
but I've got a feeling that they're in
the disinformation business if you know
what I mean
about the fact checkers are the fact
Checkers there to make sure your facts
are right nope they're there to make
sure you don't know the facts because
they're they're politically oriented
so
if you have on your your cynical hat
anytime somebody is anti-something or
dis something
or checking something
is the opposite
it's just it literally it's the opposite
and once you understand that everything
starts making sense it's like oh it's
the anti-discrimination of people oh
they're going to discriminate against
people I got it and then they will you
can watch it
most Holocaust deniers deny being a
holocaust denier
well do you still beat your husband
yeah because a lot of people are going
to say no to that
all right
um
so musk is suing them and his claim is
that the ADL primarily because he talked
to advertisers and they they name them
the ADL pressured advertisers
that there will be problems if they did
not stop advertising on X which made
musk's 22 billion dollar investment
worth uh you know maybe nothing
so he's uh he speculated on on the
platform that even if they were only
responsible for let's say 10 of his loss
it could be a couple billion dollars
now I saw one lawyer who seemed to be
self-labeling if you know what I mean if
you know what I mean he was
self-labeling himself as not credible he
had a hashtag BLM in his bio
he's a lawyer
and today in 2023
he has to hashtag BLM in his in his bio
we we yeah you know you immediately have
to Discount anything that comes out of
that account
because it's self-labeling
is there somebody who doesn't know that
BLM was a fake organization
is he the last one nobody told them
nobody mentioned that
um all right
well
um I am so glad that Elon Musk exists
because once you see the the total evil
of the ADL
uh they're just destroying lives of
people because they get points and it's
basically a Democrat organization that
you know does some good things
that and they just go after anybody
who's not on board with their
Democrat agenda and they just turn you
into races and try to cancel you so
that's the sort of their process
now let me ask you this
if you were going to hire a Ghost
Hunters let's say somebody advertise I
can find out if there's a ghost in your
house do you think there's a good chance
they're going to find one
because they get paid
to find ghosts
yeah something tells me they might find
one right yeah what do you think would
happen
if your literal job is to find racists
do you think you'd find any
and do you think you would get paid more
or your prestige would be more the more
of them you found
and what would any normal human being do
in a situation
in which they would make more money
by lying
and exaggerating than playing it
straight what happens in a hundred
percent of those cases over time
a hundred percent of the time they're
corrupt
not sometimes
not once in a while
not it happened a few times and I can
name them no a hundred percent of the
time you put any human being in a
situation where lying makes them rich
and telling the truth just makes them
have a job
they'll all lie
you know somebody you know get get to a
Suitor
but everybody in that situation is going
to lie
have you ever worked for a big
Corporation
they're all liars every Department every
manager they're all lying all the time
all the time
it never turns off do you know why
they make more money by lying
that's the whole story
yeah a corporate incentive structure is
whoever does the best work
and people notice the noticing is the
important part
they get the most money in the
promotions so it's this it's a a system
which bias design
guarantees that all the participants
will be Liars
you get that right by Design
by Design you're paid for who thinks you
did the best job not who did the best
job and so people are lying to get the
big promotions everybody all the time
have you ever seen anybody's like list
of accomplishments in a company oh here
are my monthly accomplishments you'd be
like okay all right it's a pretty long
list of accomplishments yeah I do notice
that the one at the top there that that
actually was that was last quarter
and you know I ask you about your
accomplishments this quarter so I won't
count that one because that was last
quarter but you know there's still a lot
of them on here to see you participated
well here's you just participated
yeah I'm not sure you were responsible
for this you were just sort of attended
some meetings but you've got this as an
accomplishment
okay and then we'll see there's uh your
other accomplishments are oh it looks
like you lowered expenses that's great
but hold on let me read this more
carefully you lowered expenses oh from
what they could have been
not what they were
so things could have been worse so
you're taking the the what could have
been worse as your benefit I'm not sure
that counts and by the time you're done
there are no accomplishments
like all corporate people know how to
make nothing into something
and you all have to do it even at the
employee level
so no now to look at the ADL
does the ADL find some really bad people
and call them out of course
yeah they got a staff they got to do
some work if they run out of really bad
people
are they done
do you think they ever have a meeting
and say wow looks like we got everybody
and the few new ones we're getting them
as they come I mean we're just we're
just getting them all so everybody you
can you know you can lower your efforts
we got everything covered we found all
the anti-Semitism we've called it all
out we've done what we can
no the the by Design
entities are designed to grow
th is the default for any any entity it
always wants to grow because when you're
shrinking you're unhappy when you're
growing you're happy oh I'm in the right
place I'm definitely in the right place
this this thing's taken off
so if you create an organization to find
discrimination they will first find all
of the real discrimination because
that's the low-hanging you know fruit
and then they will go after fake things
because that's where their money is
Steve Jacobs
uh you know he's talking to somebody
jayus he says if you listen to Scott at
any speed he sounds like an arrogant
narcissist
now let me ask you who is it that calls
people narcissists
narcissists is literally built into the
name
if you go online and say what is the
main like main characteristic of a
narcissist they'll blame you for being a
narcissist it's like their main go-to
it's like what they're famous for
bet you didn't know that did you
all right so if musk sues the ADL in a
business that would be one of the best
things for the country and I do wonder
if they know that they are an
existential threat
to America itself
would you agree that free speech is
fundamentally important for the ongoing
health of the country you would right
and would you agree that they're getting
rid of free speech as quickly as they
can making it a sort of a one-party
speech is okay yeah
they're getting rid of the most
important part of the country they're
doing it publicly
vigorously
and transparally
you can all watch it yourself you don't
even have to wonder
yeah so they don't you know they get rid
of some you know bad speech but even uh
even green blood is that his name uh in
2016 there's of any of him saying that
they're not trying to ban anybody's
speech
they're only trying to replace bad
speech with good speech because that's
how you battle bad speech
and then they went after the advertisers
on on X exactly the opposite of what
they say they would do
I tried to actually just stop it and
make it economically impossible ruin
reputations you know defame people like
me
all right
um
so uh Trump or musk must said that he
would release the all the ADL
uh files and documentations so we should
be able to see
the contacts the ADL made with old
Twitter
so we can see what they were trying to
ban and why
do you think I'll be on the list
is depends it depends when the list was
put together I guess
they came for the turds and I did not
speak out because I was not a turd
that's funny
uh
so yeah the ADL is a existential threat
to the country and you know what they
would say about that
I must be a racist
guess what
that's what they say to that
all right
uh
Alexander vinman
uh
the least credible person in America
he said that
he said that companies that he said this
today or yesterday maybe companies that
continued to advertise on X are
sponsoring anti-semitism
uh
who's apparent to me that Elon Musk
tweeting against the ADL and Jay
Greenblatt is targeting them for
harassment
now is that the narcissism thing
the ADL is a
entity that targets people for
harassment
that's sort of their entire job and he's
saying that if you complain about them
targeting you for harassment you've
targeted them for harassment
do you see how all this works
if if you're if they attack you and you
complain about it then you're twice as
bad as you were before they even
attacked you because you've complained
about it too
yes I've called Trump a grandiose
narcissist and I've called myself if
you'd like to argue about narcissism you
should go study up but don't just shout
stupid things in the comments
so learn that there's two types
learn the difference and then cut back
but don't just you know yell things with
narcissists in the sentence that you
don't know anything about you gotta get
a little more a little more depth in
your understanding and then you you can
come back
all right
sounds more like circular large logic
hmm
what is vinman's deal
well I don't know but he doesn't act
like he's on the side of America
I mean sometimes you say oh it's a
different opinion but it doesn't act
like it's just a different opinion he
acts like there's something going on
that we don't understand
all right are you loving the story about
the 15 well-dressed Nazis in Florida
who Rolling Stone reported they were
DeSantis followers because they mocked
DeSantis and said f DeSantis and so the
Rolling Stone supporter says they must
be DeSantis supporters because they say
they had
so that that's the state of your news
but uh let me ask you this
if you think that the Nazis those 15
well-dressed ones who have some kind of
name I don't care about
um if you think that it's not organic
who do you think's behind it go who do
you think would be on be behind it if
it's not organic
you say the CIA why would they do that
no it's not the ADL I doubt it's the ADL
FBI you think
uh there's one entity that you have not
considered
isn't there one obvious entity that
you've not considered
thank you
how are you not getting this
this is weird
you're
your your suggestions are all completely
there's like a blind spot here that's
fascinating
you really don't see it
yeah some of you are saying Trump
and uh
I would say more generally Republicans
here's what we know about them
that they prefer Biden over Republicans
and they're putting on a public event
which reminds you of
what's it remind you of
do they remind you of anything
they're well dressed
they've got really nice Flags
Charlottesville yeah it reminds you of
Charlottesville doesn't it except isn't
it weird that they're like opposite of
Charlottesville
isn't it funny that there would be
neo-nazis
who would be marching
like really the opposite of
Charlottesville because they're
pro-biden
and Biden actually ran for office
on the fine people hoax because
Democrats don't know that that's a hoax
they think it's real
and then now there's this other thing
that looks very suspicious
that looks like it's almost like mocking
the Charlottesville event it's to me
it's
so like mirror mirror copy except this
one's Pro Biden
interesting
I'm just going to say that I don't think
there's any chance it's organic
in the sense that I doubt they don't
have any outside influence
I don't know the degree of the
influencer exactly who it is but it
would be very unusual if they did all
this and didn't have some kind of
downside influence
do you think they all bought their own
shirts and flags
I doubt it
do you think any of them are getting any
kind of compensation
I don't know
I don't know but given that uh given
that they seem to be anti-biden
or no they seem to be pro-biden which in
the dirty tricks world would be an
anti-biden thing
right you get that if they say they like
Biden but they're Nazis
that may be the trick
I I just wouldn't uh I wouldn't make any
assumptions about who they really are or
what they're really up to
but I will say this
if it's a republican dirty trick
it looks like one
it's really clever
it's really clever
because very few of you thought of it as
your first your first take
now I don't know I don't have any inside
information so I don't know
but I will tell you has all the Tells
of a very suspicious thing
so you have to look at who would benefit
from it
and that's your answer
uh the skiff boats yeah
uh I heard they said they backed
DeSantis that that was fake news in the
Rolling Stones right they actually said
the opposite
but they the Rolling Stones did a rupar
uh because they were sarcastic they said
uh yeah we support DeSantis and then
they laughed and said DeSantis
so Rolling Stone reported their sarcasm
as their actual opinion
even though the rest of the quote was
immediately in the next sentence you
know do you think the Rolling Stone
didn't know the next sentence
you think they didn't know
that they called out very clearly that
they were being sarcastic of course they
did they just chose not to write it that
way of course they knew
yeah of course
uh
Qui Bono yes
who benefited right
for the non-lawyers
when you hear somebody in the comments
say cui Bono it's sort of like follow
the money right
sort of a follow the money even if it's
not money situation
all right
uh who profits exactly
what's a rupar a rupar is a edited video
or audio or or in this case a quote
which
reverses the meaning of what somebody
said
uh in a way that you could never imagine
it could be reversed for example if you
read that the the
Nazi guy
if you read that his real words were
we support DeSantis
could you ever in your mind imagine that
there was anything that was edited out
of that that would reverse it to the
opposite of we support DeSantis now your
brain can't do it so if your brain says
okay you know maybe it's not the exact
quote but it's not the reverse of the
quote right you would never guess it's
the opposite your brain just doesn't go
there
so that's why it works because there are
actually a lot of things you can turn to
their opposite if you if you choose
correctly that's what the fine people
hoax was
Etc
yeah where the rupar repair team rupar
repairs
there's a deep fake of DeSantis dropping
out
uh Sonny Bono
you kick yourself when I laugh at your
jokes okay
all right what else is going on that's
all I got for now so YouTube I'm gonna
say bye it's going to be a weird small
week this week and probably not a lot of
news oh here's the other thing about the
Nazis
did you notice that they were
suspiciously timed for a known slow news
period
did anybody notice that that's where the
dog not barking situation
that when kids go back to school and you
know around now especially a three-day
weekend pretty much the news stops
so what are the odds that the Nazis knew
that that was a slow news period
do you remember when the Charlottesville
March happened
do you remember when that happened
it was in the summer
do you know what happens in the summer
no news
so when you see an OP like that that
somehow knows when there's not going to
be any other news competing with it
is that a coincidence is that something
the Nazis figure down on their own do
you think the Nazis were thinking all
right given the news cycle
if we get it near the Labor Day there's
not going to be a lot of news so then
we'll have more exposure
or is it just a coincidence that they
chose so well
that they hit that low news period just
perfectly
because they're really smart Nazis right
oh no every part of this looks
artificial to me
but you never know
all right
uh that's all we got now and I'll say
bye to you on YouTube thanks for joining
