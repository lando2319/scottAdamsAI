good morning everybody
well I'm so glad you could make it here
and on time too wow
wow
now I have heard that there's a little
uh issue on YouTube
that sometimes the beginning of the show
is covered with commercials
and those commercials are obscuring the
simultaneous sip
and so I'm thinking that today I should
do a segment before I do the Sip what do
you think yes yes I think we'll try that
I think we'll try something new don't be
afraid to change don't be afraid to
change
we'll get to that in a moment
well the uh there's a sad story in the
news about uh ex-professional NFL
quarterback Colt Brennan
who died of what is being called an
accidental overdose
with fentanyl
accidental overdose
hmm
and accidental overdose
so here's what we know about fentanyl we
know that China intentionally provides
it to the cartels to provide to the
United States to kill tens of thousands
Americans every year and they could stop
it if they wanted to because they
literally know the name and the address
of the person who's sending the fentanyl
to the United States we know they know
the name and the address of who's doing
it because the United States gave it to
them it was news here's your guy here's
literally the guy who's sending us all
the Fentanyl and killing 30 whatever
60 000 people a year whatever the number
is now we know who it is we have his
name in his picture
you have his address
they didn't pick him up
okay
now
is that an accident
did this quarterback die of a quote
accidental overdose
no it's not an accident when somebody's
trying to kill you and they succeed
let me give you an analogy because I
know analogies are so persuasive right
oh shut up I'm gonna give you one anyway
remember the Las Vegas mass shooting the
shooter was up in the window
and just started spraying bullets at the
crowd of people at the concert
now some people were killed and some
people were not
would you say that the people who were
killed were killed by accident
were those accidental deaths
because nobody knew who would be killed
right when the guy started shooting he
wasn't shooting at anybody he was
shooting at the crowd
the fact that he he actually killed some
people in the crowd and did not kill
others would you call that an accidental
death then
because he didn't know he was going to
kill somebody I mean he didn't know the
specific person he would kill
so it's an accident right no you
idiots it's not an accident it's
murder
it's murder if you spray bullets into a
crowd and it happens to kill somebody
but you didn't know exactly who it would
kill before you killed him is
murder
when China sends us a boatload of
Fentanyl
and it kills 30 to 50 000 Americans a
year but they don't know which names in
advance
are going to die
that didn't make it an accident it's
still murder
and when I see a tweet
that calls the
the death by fentanyl overdose
an accident
I'm offended
because it's not a accident
it's murder
and if we don't treat it that way well
we deserve what we get
maybe not the individuals who die from
it they don't deserve it but as a
country if we're not going to defend
ourselves from tens of thousands of
murders
every year
well we deserve what we get and
you deserve the government you got
Trump didn't do about it Biden
isn't doing about it
 them all
now
how would you like to do this I will
take a step
I probably shouldn't have started with
that story
but if you'd like to uh things up maybe
put things on a little bit uh better
Pace well what can you do
well one thing you could do is grab
yourself a cup or a mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea starting a canteen Dragon
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and drive me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen right now go
China
so the New York Times has this story
that confirms what I think the BBC
reported months ago
that uh
the Iranian the head of the nuclear
program in Iran was
assassinated with a robot machine gun
a robot machine gun with satellite
satellite control
and artificial intelligence for facial
recognition
that's right somehow Israel the Mossad
got a one ton robot
into into Iran they I guess they brought
it in on in pieces in different ways so
they brought it in they assembled it
they put it on I think it was on the bed
of a pickup truck
and they parked that pickup truck
approximately where they knew that the
head of the nuclear program would be
going by but here's the problem
they couldn't be sure
that it would be that guy and maybe not
his wife driving or somebody else
driving they wanted to minimize the
number of casualties so they set up a a
second station where there would be a
car that looked like it was a changing a
tire or something and they would have a
camera in it and they would get a get a
read on the driver of the car so they
would know
if their target was even in the car
so the the first thing that they set up
just identifies the guy
and then he gets to the place where the
robot machine gun is and the robot
machine gun opens fire
but apparently I think the machine gun
had facial recognition too because it
managed to kill
uh the guy they were after without
harming the wife now harm of course
being a relative term means she wasn't
shocked but if you watch your husband
being killed right in front of you
you're obviously harmed but
kind of amazing I mean I don't know if
that was luck or skill that the that
nobody else got killed or at least the
wife did
but uh when we see that a robot machine
gun is killing people using facial
recognition
um
what's next
how many robots with facial recognition
can you put out there to start shooting
people with their machine guns
yeah it's similar to remote aerial
drones except that you don't see the the
Drone in the sky which would be a
tip-off I guess that's why they didn't
use aerial drones because the the Drone
is big enough
I think the story was that a drone that
was big enough to penetrate Iranian
space would also be too big and the
Iranians would see it and shoot it down
but apparently they can do that I guess
Iran has the ability to shoot down
drones
fairly effectively
well Joe Biden tweeted this he said uh
corporations and the super wealthy have
to start paying their fair share of
taxes it's long overdue
he says I'm not out to punish anyone all
I'm asking is that you pay your fair
share just like middle-class folks do
so what have I told you about the word
Fair
is a word that was developed for one
purpose to allow idiots and children to
debate
because if you're an idiot or you're a
child you may not have reasons and data
to support your argument so instead you
just say it isn't fair
and it must be fair
do you know why it must be fair
because it's not fair
but why is it not fair
well it's not
it's just not fair and it must be fair
this is what I call word thinking
meaning that if you don't have reasons
or you can't express them or you don't
want to you try to get away with
defining a word
in a way that it sounds like the word is
the argument
but words are not arguments words are
just things we gave definitions to
they're not arguments at all but yet our
dumb little brains often thinks those
words are arguments and it works that's
the weird thing making a word that just
substitutes for a rational argument
actually works and so I thought how do
you debate somebody who just says
something isn't fair
and then you go
um
I don't know what to say about that
because it's a little bit subjective
isn't it
are your taxes fair if the rich people
pay the most dollar amount
or do they also have to pay the greatest
percentage
why is one fair and the other one isn't
I don't know there's no reason we just
decide things are fair or not fair and
We complain about them
so I thought since the word Fair
introduces an irrational form of debate
how can you counter an irrational form
of debate well hell well you came to the
right place
what you need
is a new word
something that would counter the word
Fair
and that you could just drop it in there
and just walk away
because you don't need a rational
argument because you're not debating a
rational argument you're debating a word
which is crazy
so I came up with a new word
I don't think it's being used
if anybody's already using this word for
something else let me know
and the word is called
glarpin
so the word is glurping and here's the
definition I've given it the definition
of glorpin is a situation in which
different outcomes is better for all
let me give you an example of a glorpin
how many of you can play basketball as
well as Stephen Curry
anybody anybody probably nobody I'll bet
nobody here can play basketball as well
as Stephen Curry
is that fair
no that's not fair why is it he can play
basketball great and I can't I wasn't
born that way I don't have these
opportunities that's not fair
but
is it bad for me
am I worse off because Stephen Curry is
a better basketball player than I am
not really because he wins because he
gets to play basketball and have a good
life gets paid and I get to watch him
and it's entertaining
so it might worse off
because of this unfairness or am I
better off
well I'm actually better off because I
would like to watch him
he likes to play we both win it's a
perfect lurping opportunity
now
you always look for your glurpens
wherever you've got a some kind of
unfairness but it's better than not
having the unfairness for example
suppose you raised taxes on corporations
and you raised them to the point where
those corporations were no longer
competitive in the international market
would that be more fair well perhaps it
would perhaps be a little more fair the
way people Define it
but it would also be a little globen
wouldn't it
anti-glorpin I would think
anti-glurpin because a glorpin situation
would be where it's unfair but you're
better off
so maybe it's unfair that corporations
pay smaller taxes
but if it makes all of us richer
because those those profits from
corporations flow into the public
directly and indirectly
well that's a glorpin so the next time
you get into a conversation with
somebody says you need to pay more taxes
to make it fair
here's your response I see what you're
saying about the fairness but have you
considered the glurpin
because this is one of those situations
where the glarpin works in your favor
and then just walk away
if somebody says hold on what's a
glarpon I go oh a glorpin a glorpin is
one of those situations in which
outcomes are different but you're better
off because of it
it's a glorpin
take that to the bank
all right
I love it when
people in the news business fight each
other I love it when Fox News goes after
CNN and vice versa
and
I'm loving this story about Politico
ing Jennifer Rubin
hard
so Politico is doing some a hit piece on
Jennifer Rubin
it's basically saying she was uh tough
on Obama and tough on Biden at one point
but now she's loving Biden I guess she's
pro-bun
and they're quite kind of making the
point that she
she's not a credible uh abundant but
rather goes
goes where the forces are are let's say
nudging her
and
Jennifer Rubin responded in an email
which she said was off the Record off
the Record but Politico published it
anyway I'll tell you why in a moment in
which she claimed it was misogyny and
sexism that she was being singled out
because she was a prominent woman
and so the reason Politico was going
after Jennifer Rubin says Jennifer Rubin
is because of her vagina
because of her vagina
and breasts
and possibly womb um maybe uterus
but the reasons that they would after
Jennifer Rubin and not a man
is because obviously men have penises
women have vaginas and so logically QED
ipso facto
there you go perfectly reasonable
response when somebody criticizes your
public professional record to claim it's
because of your vagina
that's what I do anybody criticizes me
I'm like ho ho ho wait a minute I hear
your criticisms and the objective person
might even say that they're valid but I
think the reason you're doing it
is because my scrotum
that's what I say to everybody I go ho
ho I I see you calling me bald
but would you call me bald if I didn't
have a scrotum
I don't think so I think this is
scrotum related discrimination
wait that was Jennifer rubin's steak it
was all about her vagina
and Politico
despite the fact that Jennifer Rubin
said her email was off the Record
Politico
published it in full
what do you think of that well
politico's excuse was that that's not
how off the Record Works
and they would know they're in the
business right off the Record Works like
this
I'd like to say something off the Record
do you agree
yes I agree to keep this off the Record
okay here's what I was going to say off
the Record
and then
if it's a ethical entity that has agreed
they do not print that
here's how off the Record does not work
this is off the record and then they
just tell you what they're going to say
that's not off the Record that's on the
record
because the other entity didn't agree to
it
had they agreed it would be on it would
be off the Record but if they don't
agree
and they're not even given the chance to
agree because she sent the email at the
same time as the you know this is off
the Record
apparently they feel they have the
ethical uh
the ethical let's say flexibility to
print it in full
well let me give you my opinion on this
yes
yes they have a point Jennifer Rubin
does know how off the Record Works of
course because she's in the business
Politico also knows how off the Record
Works because they're in the business
and they they applied their what they
know correctly
it was correct correct and accurate that
this was not off the Record and
therefore they did have
let's say a right
to publish it
do you know what else it was
really messed up
really messed up really unethical
really unethical
super super unethical
Politico
while you are technically within your
right
that is a really up thing to do
really up in fact it's so
up that nobody should ever give them a
quote again or an interview
that see that's the cost
these things have a price
the price of violating somebody's
preference for being off the Record even
if they didn't do it right
the preference was expressed
and if you're going to violate that
preference for being off the record on a
technicality
nobody should ever do an interview again
in fact I'd like to support Jennifer
Rubin now I've not been a Jennifer Rubin
supporter
you know in the past on political stuff
nothing personal just political stuff
but I'm going to support her now
and in support of Jennifer Rubin if
Politico ever asked me for an interview
I'm not going to give it to him
no quotes for Politico they have crossed
the line
they cross the line
completely within their ethical
boundaries meaning that the standard for
off the Record
is very clear and they followed the
standard and they found a way around it
and they published it but
it's a up thing to do
it's a up thing to do
I I hear somebody in the comments saying
she deserved it blah blah no that's
irrelevant
doesn't matter that she deserved it and
I don't think that's even a thing nobody
deserves anything
um so Politico here's your here's your
pushback and I would encourage anybody
in the
um I would encourage anybody
to not ever do an interview again with
an entity that would do this not only
did they do it they're bragging about it
they're doing it right in front of you
do not do business with Politico and I
don't care what you think of Jennifer
Rubin Pro or Khan if they can do that to
her they can do it to you and if they're
going to find a technicality to you
well then they they've they've lost
their moral uh authority to be in this
business really
even though they're technically correct
uh people who have no sense of humor are
not aware of it
and that explains a lot of what you see
in the world
people who have no sense of humor
don't know it
if you've ever watched American Idol
back in the early days of the show that
I don't know if they do it anymore but
they would show the people who were
auditioning
and a number of those people auditioning
didn't know that they couldn't sing and
they weren't any good at all
now that's unusual
most people know if they have a skill
usually they know if they have a skill
um I know for example that I don't
appreciate Opera
but I don't think Opera is broken I just
think I don't appreciate it
um I don't appreciate fine wine
but I understand it's a thing and people
do appreciate it and they like it so I
don't think there's something wrong with
wine I just think there's something
wrong with me
but people who don't have a sense of
humor
they actually don't know that they don't
have one
and so they think the problem is with
you
right the people with no sense of humor
they think the problem's on your end
and that's different than other other
lack of skill
right if somebody uh
you know doesn't appreciate music or
something they don't think the problems
are your end
all right so just keep that in mind that
they're uh and I I think something like
a third of the public literally doesn't
have a sense of humor
and you need to stay away from those
people if you want to have a good time
all right so there's a big dust up with
France and the United States
and it looks like so here's the deal I
guess France had this deal they'd been
negotiating for years to sell a dozen
non-nuclear
non-nuclear submarines to Australia
but the United States got in their
business and said hey China is a big
threat why don't we sell you some
nuclear submarines we'll get you some
good none of this non-nuclear
submarines for you Australia
you're you're our good friends we're
going to give you some give you some
nuclear sub breeds so that China will be
on notice that uh that the other team
has some good stuff in their region
and France uh thought this was a crappy
deal and even though I guess we claim
there's some technicality in the
contract that France and Australia had
for those submarines
apparently there wasn't a clause that
allowed Australia to cancel the deal I
don't know what it was or if other
people would agree it was valid but they
did
friends got all mad and recalled their
uh their ambassadors for consultation
just to sort of make a point and stamp
their feet and complain about it I guess
it's a pretty big dollar amount like I
don't know 65 billion dollars or some
big number in the billions
and I I think that the
the mechanism for this was started
during the Trump Administration if I'm
right
now
um
yeah Biden's I'm reading in the comments
uh Biden is literally who Democrats
claimed Trump was
doesn't this sound like a trump thing
to get into somebody's deal and cancel
it and negotiate some for yourself and
come out ahead
because the U.S comes out ahead on this
yeah it sounded very much like Trump
deal and apparently he got it going and
Biden liked it enough that he kept going
with it and I I would compliment both
presidents
this is very American America first
I I don't know when was the last time
you saw anybody do anything that's as
America first as this
and and Biden did it right
now
you know I I have viciously criticized
Biden for his dementia and lots of other
stuff being you know being a liar plenty
of stuff but when he does stuff I like
I'm going to call it out and I hope you
don't mind that I hope you can hang with
that because I just think it's more
credible if you if you can't compliment
the people you're criticizing
you just don't have any credibility at
all
so I would say France doesn't like it
but we're not going to lose France as an
ally in the long run it's good for our
national security and that's the end of
the conversation
it's good for the United States national
security and we're done here
yeah France is mad
it doesn't matter
it's good for our national security in
the long run
all right I said something controversial
here those of you asking for the Sip you
already missed it
um I predicted that wherever artificial
intelligence has the most penetration
he said penetration
uh wherever has the most penetration uh
the human birth rate will decline
does anybody want to take a guess about
why that would happen wherever there is
the most artificial intelligence
the human birth rate will go down
now some people said oh that's a
coincidence because wherever you have
the most industrialized richest place
the birth rate goes down and that's
exactly where you would have the most
artificial intelligence in the rich
places and that might be part of it that
might be part of it so some of it's just
coincidence right artificial
intelligence travels with money and
money makes uh birth rates go down
but I'm going to predict that there's
another thing going on and it goes like
this
I don't think that artificial
intelligence is ever going to need a
plan
to conquer humans
it will never need a plan
because it's just going to happen on its
own
no plan needed it's just going to be
evolution
so if AI just does what's good for AI
what would that look like
let's say let's imagine the AI is like a
living entity but you know different
what what does it care about what is its
Mission what's it want to do well every
living thing has one mission
to make more of itself
to survive right it's not necessarily a
like a an intention that's in their head
but it's what evolution causes you to
focus on more than anything you evolve
to be something that reproduces well
that's it that's the whole deal is you
evolve to be good at reproducing now if
AI becomes good at reproducing what
would that look like
it would look like what we see now
the way that AI reproduces is by being
good
or useful to human beings so as long as
it's useful humans will make more of it
and then eventually the AI will make
more of itself that's the singularity
and that's the thing you want to be
afraid of
but uh so so that's the situation humans
are making AI now I don't think that AI
will necessarily
say I would like to be fewer humans
so so AI will never tell us to reproduce
less
it will never directly say hey I need
fewer humans because in fact it needs
humans to help it reproduce
so AI actually needs humans
but not all of them
it doesn't need all of them
and so one would imagine that as AI
pursues its own evolutionary imperative
which is it takes a path in which there
will just be more AI
it will cause humans
to feed it
how do humans feed AI
it's when you click on your phone
it's when you click on social media
you're feeding it you're making it more
valuable because the AI is the algorithm
among other things and if the algorithm
works and it causes you to click it more
then the AI is feeding itself and making
sure that it survives and making sure
that other companies make more AI
because it worked made people click more
now if you're clicking more on what the
AI wants you to click on
even if it's not some kind of an
intention or a plan It's Just Happening
evolution
are you as interested in reproduction
well in the short term yeah sure
but what about the long term when you
become addicted to your devices
as you become addicted to your devices
those devices are giving you dopamine
and replacing some of the things you get
from other people
and so you become a little click robot
to feed the AI
and what you do instead of living and
reproducing is work for the AI I must
click for the AI I must and then you're
getting the AI is giving you a a boost a
little reward and then you you're
addicted I must do more of this I'm
addicted I'm getting a little boost
and so
AI will never need a plan
to reduce humans on Earth it will just
happen
because in order to feed the AI we have
to be turned into click slaves
and other other kind of slaves as well
and when we're being diverted from our
main mission which is to reproduce
there'll be less of it because we're our
energy will just be moved somewhere else
all right now some of you are saying
keep your hand on the AI or or the
programs will be written so the AI won't
attack us and try to kill us and I think
that's probably true
I don't think the AI
will ever decide to kill humans you know
except for maybe a glitch here or there
but I don't think I don't think Humanity
will be wiped out by a Skynet like an
actual thinking human who wants to or a
thinking AI that wants to destroy us I
think it will simply evolve better than
us
it will simply out compete us and use us
as part of its competition
and then that's it it's game over
all right
um do you ever see a famous person that
maybe you don't quite appreciate their
talent but
you think well okay they've definitely
got that X Factor and then there are
other people you say I don't quite get
what makes this person so famous
you don't get it and then you see it
and then once you see you go oh okay I
get it there was an extra speed this
person does have this little extra
and for me this was Nicki Minaj now of
course I knew she was a highly talented
you know musical artist
but did I think
that there was something special about
her
didn't really see it I'm not really a
music guy so much so while it was
obvious she was hugely talented I didn't
know what was the special part
till today
until today
um so she tweeted because you know the
story Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend
allegedly got a vaccination in Trinidad
and allegedly his balls swelled up and
he became impotent but Trinidad says it
never happened and there is no such
person
Etc
but it got Nicki Minaj into the
headlines talking about vaccination
safety and apparently she retweeted
Tucker Carlson talking about
her situation and Tucker was completely
supportive of her so she tweets it now
of course she got a lot of crap because
Tucker is associated with the right many
of her fans associated with the left and
they got on her pretty hard
here's the part
that made me appreciate why Nicki Minaj
is famous
and other people who might also have
talent are not
here's the X Factor you ready here's
where she tweeted in response to all
this business
she goes right I can't speak to agree
with even look at someone from a
particular political party
people aren't human anymore
if you're black and a Democrat if you're
black and the Democrat tells you to
shove marbles up your ass you simply
have to
if another party tells you to look out
for that bus stand there and get hit
okay
here's what here's the moment I fell in
love with Nicki Minaj
if you're black and a Democrat tells you
to shove marbles up your ass you simply
have to
Shop marbles up your ass
is that a saying
can somebody tell me is that an existing
saying
is there something about shoving marbles
up your ass that's like a you know maybe
something she learned when she was a kid
or did she make that up on the spot
because here's the thing
if she made it up
then I get it like suddenly I get like
there's a reason that Nicki Minaj is
famous
uh and successful and you can you see
like a little hint of it here
I don't know there's just something so
perfect about this tweet if you're black
and a Democrat tells you to shove
marbles up your ass you simply have to
I could not love that sentence more
somebody says it's trumpian yup yeah
it's not like Trump exactly
but like Trump
when Trump does a tweet
every time he tweets you go okay that's
why he's famous
that's why we talk about it okay I get
it Trump can do that time after time at
the time he shows you why he's special
every time he opens his mouth
Kanye too you have somebody saying in
the comments Kanye has that same quality
yeah absolutely
all right switching topics
as your uh resident humorist
I feel it is my need to search out
funny things for you to consume and it's
a problem because there are no longer
funny movies and very few funny TV shows
it's almost no longer a thing but there
are three
TV
properties that I think are fantastic
only three
I can't think of a fourth
three things you just gotta watch now
yeah somebody's saying Gutfeld yeah you
have to watch goffelt so if you're a
News Junkie you like the news yeah
that's sort of a specialty case but if
you're looking for
pure humor as opposed to you know newsy
plus Uber which is a little different
genre but if you're looking for Pure
humor
here are the three
what we do in the shadows that's the
name of a TV show about vampires in
America
who are just living among the people and
I'm not going to give away
too much of the story but watch it from
the beginning
and it is just the best thing is so good
I like everything about it it's called
what we do in the shadows
um just Google it if you you know Define
the network and the streaming place it
is the other is Ted lasso I talked about
that Ted lasso won like just a ton of
Emmys and I thought to myself it doesn't
look that good
because the the advertisements just I
don't know they didn't look good but the
problem is that it's a show that can't
be captured in an advertisement there's
something about the entirety of the
experience
that is what makes it great it's not
about the the specific line or the scene
that makes it great it has lots of great
scenes lots of great lines
but there's something about the hole
that makes it special and you just you
just can't tell by looking at it at the
trailers for it and the other is Rick
and Morty
now Rick and Morty is a little bit more
of a uh acquired taste maybe not for
everybody but
if you like my content
the odds that you would like these three
shows while we do in the shadows Ted
lasso and Rick and Morty is pretty good
so just give it a try all right there's
no guarantees we're all different it's
very subjective but I'd say give it a
try those are some real good ones
uh Bill Maher continues to be disgusted
at the left
which Never Never Fails to amuse me and
he's talking about the fact that aoc's
dress said tax the rich and Bill Maher
who of course is Rich would like you to
know
that the rich pay a lot of taxes
and I felt like he had to tell his
audience that because they didn't know
did you know the rich pay most of the
taxes most of them yeah and so what AOC
wears her address tax the riches I feel
like there are dumb people who think
there are things called write-offs
and tax breaks that make rich people pay
no taxes that's not a thing
if a rich person pays no taxes it's
because the system wanted the rich
person to pay no taxes do you know what
gets you to pay no taxes
investing you know hiring people
that sort of thing so you're supposed to
be doing that stuff
all right
sign of the times
there was a Ohio woman who apparently
was shot
three times by allegedly by her baby
daddy
and instead of calling 9-1-1 after she
was shot
three times
not once
not twice
has three bullet holes in her
but instead of calling 9-1-1
she went on to Instagram live
sign of the times
that was our first thought her first
thought was as she lay their bleeding
like oh this is going to be good content
I'm gonna get a lot of clicks
now as luck would have it her relatives
saw the live stream and called 9-1-1 and
and she was saved
but uh
I don't even know what to say about that
what the hell do you even say about that
I guess the story is its own story
um here's something that snuck up on you
the you know you were expecting to be a
there'd be a Pfizer booster shot you had
to get
well the FDA just squashed that
turns out the FDA they must have looked
at the data and said that the data
doesn't support
the safety and efficacy of you know
collectively safety plus efficacy of the
booster for the Pfizer now I don't know
about modernity yet
maybe that's different
but did anybody see this coming
and what does it mean and why they turn
it down
are they getting more conservative
I I think part of it was if I'm not
mistaken
uh that you didn't want to do boosters
for everybody until everybody got at
least one shot or something like that so
some of it might have had uh
something to do with priorities right
because I think there's some people are
arguing that there's a higher priority
to give everybody at least one shot
than it would be to give the vaccinated
a booster if you have limited quantities
and of course they're always Limited
um
yeah I'm seeing the question why are the
feds rationing regeneron we've had so
much time to make more regeneron is it
that hard to make
because I think it is
please consider that some topics are too
complex
um
I need someone in person to push back oh
I mean as in having a guest
is that what is that what your comment
was about
um
here's why I don't have guests
you have plenty of that
plenty of guests I don't think people
watch me to watch the guests now if I do
guess and I have considered it a lot
um I would do it as a separate content
so if I do it I'd probably do it
recorded
and I would I don't know wouldn't have
to be recorded but there's a whole
tactical problem with guests that it's
hard to solve believe it or not
um for live stream it's hard to solve
yeah but I didn't like it as much I did
it in the past which is how I know I
don't like it
because I feel like
um
if it's a guest who's in the political
Realm
and they're just pundits and they're
just taking a point of view it's just
not interesting those are just lying
right just watching somebody lie and me
challenging them is that interesting
um but I do think in my future I'll be
talking to more people so there will be
more people to push back
all right uh I saw a tweet from uh
safety Dean
I don't know I don't know how to
pronounce it cyphadene
I apologize I'm saying your name wrong
and uh his tweet said this if you
believe lockdowns social distancing
masks and vaccines are all effective
enough for you to want to do them
but not effective unless you force
others to do them
consider the alternative hypothesis that
they're about authoritarianism not
health
what do you think about that
how many of you believe that the
pandemic management everything from
vaccinations to masks and lockdowns and
everything how many of you believe that
the real game is authoritarianism and
that it's to get control over the public
I'm going to look at your comments and
read them yup totally yes yes yes agree
you agree very very strong agreement
with that it depends somebody says
control plausible
so we got a few one person disagree
huh one person and some people saying
this might be a useful secondary effect
yes yes yes uh Gary says no
all right here's my take on that it's
crazy
that's crazy
I I don't I don't know how you get that
opinion really
now
let me be clear
that my opinion is purely subjective so
could I be wrong of course have I ever
taught you that you should always have a
recording playing in your head that says
but I could be wrong right I could have
the wrong data I could be looking at it
wrong this is one of those times
so I'm going to act
um
uh I want to answer that question but I
don't want to get derailed here
um
I think it's actually
crazy
to think that all of these government
rules are about some hidden desire or
maybe not so in
for authoritarianism to get more control
over the people
I would say the evidence for that is
zero
right
what would be the evidence for that
could you imagine that we would get to
this point
and there would be not one whistleblower
not one anywhere
who would say you know I was in this
room
and the government officials were
talking about the real reason is to get
more control over the public
that never happened
this is not the sort of thing that
wouldn't leak
are you kidding me because it's
governments all over the world
it's you know even if you can imagine
that the United States government would
be really good at keep it the secret
can you imagine that the administration
changes
and when Biden comes in he's still got a
bunch of trump people still you know
doing you know work in the Deep state
or what when Trump was in office there
were plenty of Democrats in
in the bureaucracy
and you don't think anybody
there's not one person
not one person is going to be a
whistleblower and say I was in that
meeting and the real reason is they want
to get some authoritarianism going
honestly I think it's the least likely
thing of all things if you were to make
a list of all the things that people
claim
from you know elections being rigged to
Russia collusion to you name it just
make a whole list of all the claims
people are making that have any
skepticism to them all the claims
this would be this would be lowest on
the list of credibility
now again
I'll say it again because the recording
should always play in your head I could
be wrong
but
make me an argument
yeah in no I realize that this is a
complicated complex issue and you you've
only got a few characters for your
comments
but give me just a hint
of what would be your logic or support
Elite old fool uh what would be your
logic data or even rational support for
the fact that there's a secret plot
to increase authoritarianism
and for for what purpose and why would
every country be doing it
really you can't find a single country
who doesn't want to do that maybe you
could argue the Sweden went its own way
yeah I I have a feeling
it's it's disorganized opportunistic
power hmm
well I will buy I'll buy the the
following statement there are lots of
people doing lots of things about the
pandemic and some of them probably want
to keep their jobs and get a promotion
and stuff yeah there's some of that
but
whoever said I want to get some
authoritative authoritism
authoritarianism yeah I want to get some
of that
uh so here's what I would present to you
um I believe that that is just pure
cognitive dissonance maybe confirmation
bias but it feels like cognitive
distance the the idea that the
politicians are in on some secret Global
plot that no whistleblower has talked
about and after meeting after meeting
after meeting just nobody talked about
it
power grab
who's grabbing power
from whom
yeah I don't know
I mean I I can see that maybe you're
saying oh it's being used as an excuse
to get a bunch of socialist stuff
that's fair we're watching that happen
right in front of us but is that a power
grab or is that just opportunistically
they're like oh this would be a good
time to get some socialism in there
I don't know I don't think that's
authoritarianism
so much as socialism
opportunistic paragraph who
who's grabbing the power maybe maybe
let's just start with that who is it
who's grabbing the power of name names
there's somebody grabbing power who is
it the government who Biden Biden
suppressed them
does Biden have to grab power he won
he's probably not going to run for
re-election why does Biden need to grab
power
he's the president
of the
the billionaires
what what do the billionaires have to
get out of this
the world economic forum
go on and how are they benefiting from
the authoritarianism
Scott please look at Klaus Schwab I have
it's completely non-credible
um each nation's Intel community
really
how does the Intel Community gain by you
wearing a mask
and and if we wanted to to do it to
another country we wouldn't do it to
ourselves if our own Intel is
is attacking our country
why uh here's a comment why would anyone
want to control all the money and power
no I'm not saying that there's no reason
to control money and power
I'm asking who is doing it and how are
they doing getting all this
authoritarianism and why are there no
whistleblowers
right all right so I can't as you know I
can't make an argument that something
doesn't exist right you can't prove a
negative so I can't prove that this
isn't happening
I can't prove that there isn't a secret
Illuminati who's plotting to grab power
with the pandemic and the masking stuff
I can't prove this doesn't exist
but I would I would point out that you
can't prove any part of it exists not
any part of it there's no evidence no
data no nothing
so that's my take on that all right
uh remember your glypen word
and I'm just going to look at your
comments for a moment
uh there's plenty of whistleblowers are
they credible no they're not they're no
whistleblowers
uh there's there are no whistleblowers
who say
I was in the meeting and these people
are talking about you know using this to
grab power
that doesn't exist
please move the locals camera
why
now is the locals camera not right
according to my own monitor my head
would be exactly in the middle
and what I can see is from my hands to
my other hand here are you seeing
something different than this
um
oh I haven't looked at the local oh I
see what you're saying yeah so what I do
is I turn my uh I have two iPads
what happened
uh well my local stream just stopped it
looks like
um
yeah
so what I do is I have two iPads side by
side but one of them has to be upside
down and that puts their two cameras in
the same place but one is high and one
is low but I didn't have them lined up
here so usually it looks more like I'm
looking at the camera
but I'll fix that for next time
um
maybe they don't want to see your face
the rotate button is between by the full
screen button it is
sub viewers see upside down images today
really
even if you turn your device
all right that's all for now and I'll
see you YouTubers tomorrow
