hey everybody come on in come on in
yeah it's time
for coffee with scott adams the bestest
place in the entire universe
there are other dimensions
uh we haven't checked yet
but all indications are
that this is the best place to be
of all reality
don't know for sure but let's test it
all you need is a couple of bunker
glasses to take your chalice to steiner
canteen jug of last vessel any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the vaccinations it's called
the simultaneous sip and it's going to
be rocking people all over the world at
the same time
hence simultaneous and it happens now go
oh yeah
never disappoints
i just saw a tweet by richard grinnell
he says that
uh the border to mexico was opened up
before california was reopened and if
that doesn't bother you you haven't been
paying attention
well that does bother me
i gotta say that's a good
point so how many of you have
neanderthal genes have you ever had your
dna tested
well i have i got a little neanderthal
genes in me
and it turns out that that can have a
big impact on your coronavirus
outcomes
now
who told you really early in the
pandemic
that we would probably find out that the
biggest
difference in outcomes was genetic
and
looks like the biggest difference in
outcomes is genetic
now that's on top of comorbidities so
the comorbidities are still bigger but
within the comorbidities there are
plenty of people
who
um don't have bad outcomes
so there are people who are you know
overweight and they've they're older and
whatever and they just do fine
and apparently it's genetic
so the the genes can protect you even if
you've
uh not protected yourself with your
lifestyle
and i think that we will find out more
and more about this now
raises an interesting question doesn't
it
suppose
just brainstorm here
suppose the united states had a national
registry of dna
oh you don't like that do you
you don't want the government having
your dna do you
but what if they did let's just walk it
through
if they had your dna
and if a pandemic came through and they
could fairly quickly determine which
wouldn't take long
that some genetic
situations are
dangerous and some are not
given that the biggest challenge with
the vaccinations is to get it get them
to the people who were in most danger
what would happen
if you could take the people you know
are in most danger the co-morbidity
people
and then you could further divide them
by which ones are really in danger
because of genetics
suddenly you're giving your vaccines to
exactly the right people
at the moment we're giving vaccines to
sort of generally the population that we
think is statistically
has the biggest problem
but once you have the genetics
you can give it to exactly the people
who need it
you know you're getting really close to
knowing exactly what a person needs
now of course there are all kinds of
you know
privacy questions and whatnot about
anybody having your genes but here's the
thing you need to know
china is already collecting your genetic
material
so the so the question you have is do
you want to live in a future where where
china
has your genetic material
but the united states does not
because that's where we're heading and
we're heading there fast one of the
stories that didn't get much play is
that there were a number of
lab resources that people were using
that were
chinese based companies
do you want your blood and your dna to
be analyzed by an american company
that's owned by china
do you
because everybody they test
they're going to have your dna
so
i think the world is heading in a
direction where
governments will have your dna so do you
want your own government to have it
because china's gonna
china will have your dna
now
to the question of whether uh china had
developed this uh this virus
to be let's say work on some people less
than others well this uh
there's no evidence of that by the way
so that that was just a conspiracy
theory but the
apparently there's more neanderthal
genes in eastern asia than there is in
most places
so china actually has the high
percentage of neanderthal
dna but apparently there are two kinds
you know the just having neanderthal dna
doesn't mean you're good or bad
uh some people with some subsets of that
situation can do worse than others so
it's a little more complicated than that
but there doesn't seem it doesn't seem
to be true
that the the virus
is less effective against
chinese ethnic people
um one of the most fun stories of the
day is that a writer for vox aaron rupar
became so famous for uh tweeting
misleading
videos that he got in the dictionary so
the urban dictionary now calls rupaur
his last name they turned it into a verb
and it means to purposely mislead
mischaracterize a video
so the
the video of uh trump
uh at the you know the charlottesville
find people hoax
that's a rupaur
because it's a misleading video they
always cut out the end where he says he
he disavows the racist completely so you
just take that part out
and it looks the opposite it looks like
he didn't same with the drinking bleach
hoax it's just an edit you take out the
part where he's specified light
which he did before he talked about it
so you knew he was talking about light
and then when he was done
he brought it back to light so he knew
he was talking about light the whole
time
which is a real thing
but it got rhubarb
it got rupar by taking off the end and
the beginning
so you didn't see the reference to light
and then they rupar it and say it's
bleach
and then that's the story it just got
rhubarbed
now
there's nothing that makes me happier
and by the way uh uh rupar has come
after me personally
so we've had some exchanges online
so i i can't say he's my
natural enemy on twitter but
you know what i mean
she sort of is uh
but he made it into the dictionary
before i did so i i call that winning
so um
here's an interesting thing rasmussen is
going to be reporting today in a poll
that says uh 47 of democrats
think that border security is not a
vital national security concern
what
what
47 of democrats
don't think that protecting your border
is a national security concern
now
remember what i was telling you about
how consuming uh news from one source
doesn't matter if it's just the left or
just the right
science has shown that it causes brain
damage now if you're looking at this the
story and you're saying to yourself wait
a minute
nearly half of democrats think that
protecting the border doesn't have a
national security element to it
and this is a perfect example if you're
trying to explain this
how would you explain that
right would you say to yourself huh
it looks like 47 percent of democrats
are really stupid
but you know that's not true
you know that's not true
half of all democrats are stupid
i mean not more stupid than anybody else
right
so it's not their intelligence
right
and
but is is there some kind of a bias
in play well i'm not sure it's exactly a
bias
it looks like brain damage doesn't it
because this is the kind of opinion
that you could only have if your brain
wasn't working
because there's no argument
it's not like there are two arguments
and they're pretty good and you know
well i can see the other side but i
prefer this one
there's no argument in favor of opening
the border
there's none
and
uh
yeah there's certainly arguments about
how many people you let you let through
but there's certainly not an argument
that is a vital security concern
anyway so once you realize and you
reframe your understanding of the world
to say that these people are probably
literally
so this is not
i'm not giving an analogy i'm not
speaking you know figuratively
literally and scientifically brain
damaged and almost certainly you can
tell the source of the brain damage
consuming too much news on one side
once you see it you can't unsee it
because it explains everything
right it just explains everything why
doesn't this make any sense when you're
talking to these people this doesn't
make any sense
it's like you're talking to somebody
with brain damage
and it turns out
that's literally
exactly what's happening
exactly what's happening
so sometimes things are just the way
they look
here's a story that
is sort of teasing us about becoming a
big story and boy is it going to be a
big story so you know that taiwan
it's a little island country that sits
just off of china and you know that
china
has for decades claimed them as their
own even though they're
officially a separate country
and the united states has sort of you
know backed taiwan and given them
weapons and stuff so they can protect
themselves but here's the thing you need
to know
probably in the next 10 years and say
the experts
china will take take taiwan
and it's going to be easy
it's going to be easy
and
the the things i know about this
apparently it's been
you know war game
and every time the united states does a
war game on this
to figure out what would happen
if china tried to capture taiwan
and the answer is
china captures taiwan
every time
that's not even close
because of proximity
now what china is doing is quite clever
for a long-term plan if they were just
start a fight it's going to get pretty
bloody and it's going to hurt them in
international relationships forever etc
but as china builds up more and more
capability around taiwan
the number of hours it would take to
conquer all of taiwan
starts shrinking
so we're at the point now where china
could conquer taiwan in about a day
it's about it's about a one day process
currently
with their current military situation
nobody believes that taiwan could defend
itself against a you know a legitimate
attack
nobody thinks that and that that timing
will probably get down to an hour
because they'll just keep adding assets
you know the more missiles more
more ships more capability and once
taiwan is completely surrounded and the
time it will take to conquer it gets
down to about an hour
they'll just negotiate to become part of
china because it'll be their only choice
so i don't see there's any way that
taiwan could go any other direction
really in long run
and i think i think our military is
starting to uh
we're not starting to they're they're
warning the same thing but the united
states says this you know
i assume there's some kind of military
pact where we would have some
responsibility or
moral authority to help defend taiwan
but what do you do
when it's impossible
it's just impossible
you couldn't possibly militarily defend
it it's just not a thing
so here's that here's what you should
expect i would expect sometime in the
next 10 years
china will just take taiwan
and it will
it will become a
jaya issue for a few years
like hong kong
and then we'll get over it and they will
just own taiwan i don't see any other
future i just can't imagine it would
happen any other way
bernie sanders
continues to be interesting and he said
he was very uncomfortable
about twitter banning trump now he you
know he's no lover of trump of course
but uh he says but if you're asking me
do i feel particularly comfortable
that the then president of the united
states could not express his views on
twitter
and bernie says i don't feel comfortable
about that
so thank you
thank you bernie sanders
for being a voice of
of reason on this
but there's an interesting trend
developing
and if you if you're not
sort of in the writer's world
you haven't seen it
and it goes like this right now we
we the public are at the mercy of
the big platforms right
so if you're on a big platform twitter
facebook
youtube whatever you pretty much have to
do what they you know what they will
allow you to do or else you're going to
get booted off like like the president
so that gives the platforms
um narrative control
so if you're saying something that's
against the narrative
you just get shut down either boot it
off or your traffic is depressed
but there's something happening that you
might not be aware of
you've heard of i've talked about locals
which is a subscription service
so you could be free of the platform
control because the individuals on
locals just charge you a small
subscription fee and you can just see
them directly and you don't have to get
filtered by any platforms because locals
it doesn't do that each of the creators
own their own content there so it's a
different situation but even bigger than
that is sub stack are you all familiar
with sub stack
now it's essentially a
i guess i call it a platform for
writers who want to escape the you know
the narrative machines
and they get paid
a lot
a lot in fact some of them are being
paid in advance
so they could get you know very large
paycheck just for joining substack more
than they would make in legacy media
and suddenly
they have you know full access to lots
of people you have to subscribe but you
know they have lots of reach
and suddenly no platform tells them what
to say
so glenn greenwald is on sub stack and
making making quite a lot of noise
and he's become
even more interesting than he was and
he's always been interesting so to watch
to watch somebody of his talent level
suddenly completely free
it's really kind of fun to watch matt
tybee i believe is also over there
another perfect example um somebody's
saying barry weiss
i think she is over there as well
so the sub stack and locals are both
sort of recruiting if you will getting
the interesting voices the the people
who don't quite fit in the official
narrative platforms
and
here's here's the shift that's happening
the shift is moving away from the
platform controlling the narrative
back to individual stars
uh andrew sullivan's another one who's
on sub stack that's right
and locals is is pulling in lots of
people greg gotfeld's on there i'm on
there etc
so there's um
so this is a big thing
because the number as the number of
people who escape the the narrative
machines the big platforms
um they will they will become the new
opinion makers
and there is a trend toward taking the
mainstream media a little bit uh out of
the
out of the power structure
so just keep looking at this and see if
there's any
if there's any threat to this
subscription model now what i think will
happen eventually
and it might require some new company to
do this but i think eventually you will
be able to choose your voices
and then some service will stitch them
together into a channel
so that you can say well rather than
watching who cnn thinks should be on tv
or who fox news wants to interview
i'll just pick my individual writers
i'll take you know one glenn greenwald
i'll take uh you know scott adams i'll
take a barry weiss and i'll just make a
channel
that's just the people that i know are
not big liars
basically it would be a channel of
people who are not liars
they could be wrong
right i could be wrong about a lot of
stuff
but i'm pretty sure i haven't lied to
you
i mean i can't think of any reason i'd
need to
what would be the reason to lie to you i
don't have any reason
so the people who don't have a reason to
lie
i'm not part of you know i've got enough
money that if i get canceled they get
cancelled
and same with greenwald and
tyubi
etc their voices are unleashed now and
that's a really good thing to watch for
uh
i told you yesterday
that i thought sydney powell had an
airtight defense not airtight in the
sense that she'll definitely win but
solid defense let's just say it's solid
it doesn't mean she'll win
and then i watched cnn's uh eli hoenig
who apparently is a brilliant lawyer
according to cnn
and he disagrees with my completely
uneducated legal opinion
so let's talk about that
so according to eli
in order for dominion to prevail over
sydney powell if you don't know the
issue sidney powell had made claims
about dominion election
systems being uh
i don't want to use the word because
i'll get banned from social media but
but she said there were some problems
with dominion
dominion dominion is suing her for
making these claims
and
eli honig says that the dominion only
has to prove
that sydney pelo knew what she was
saying was false
and that she's basically admitted it in
her filing
because in her filing she says you
shouldn't have believed me basically i'm
paraphrasing you shouldn't have taken it
as fact
you should have taken it as my opinion
that would need to be verified
so
do you take the
scott adams legal opinion or the eli
honey legal opinion so my opinion
uh is that
i'm a reasonable person and when i heard
sydney powell talk
i believed exactly what she said
that she had an opinion
like a hunch
it was based on stuff but it was
basically a strong opinion
and that she was she was advocating
that we find out
in other words her whole thing was that
she doesn't know
she believes it to be true
and we need to find out now if she said
we know it to be true
and we don't need to do any research
because we already have the information
we know it to be true well that would be
liable
right
if she knew it was not true and she said
it was true that's pretty bad
but i think her case is solid so i've
now i've heard the opposite
and
how do you prove somebody knew something
was that that they were saying was false
how do you do that
how do you prove somebody knew what they
were saying was false
especially if somebody's job is an
advocate
if you're an advocate
you're saying some stuff that you know
is certainly uh could be questionable
but it's her job to be an advocate of
course lawyers say things that might not
be exactly true it's sort of the job
they're in
so i'm going to say again that i think
sydney powell will win this
will prevail
because it was clearly an opinion
clearly an opinion
in my opinion
it's obviously an opinion because how
could somebody know something that can't
be known
that the whole the whole problem with
dominion is that it was non-transparent
nobody looked at the code
and nobody looked at the whole process
from beginning to end
hasn't been audited in that fashion
so i think she wins
gun sales are up of course
of course people are going to buy more
guns because there's mass shooter in
shootings
and because the democrats are talking
about more gun control so
so good luck
you know good work on that democrats
more guns coming
um
so let's see
let's talk about the mass shooter
everybody's talking about the guy he was
i guess he was an immigrant from syria
he had mental problems seems pretty
clear he was anti-trump
um and
he was against islamophobes
but beyond that there's not any specific
uh
motivation for it
so we don't know the you know the
immediate cause of why he did this we
just sort of know he might have some
mental problems it looks likely he does
i'm going to make a statement you're not
going to like it all
i hate to do this to you but i have to
do this because
otherwise you won't
you won't believe i'm telling you the
truth
unless i occasionally tell you something
you don't like
otherwise you'll just think i'm telling
you all you want to hear
and here it is you get you're going to
freaking hate
this in my opinion
it's just an opinion and this opinion is
informed by my experience with hypnosis
my experience with
just the way the brain works
and it goes like this
if you banned the uh
the cool looking weapons
you would have far fewer
mass shootings
i hate to say it
now when i say the cool looking weapons
i'm talking about the coolness
i'm not talking about the killing
the killing power because as we
discussed yesterday
somebody with a handgun can do a lot of
killing and it's going to be almost no
difference right if they're good at it
but imagine kids playing video games and
watching war things and then they're
imagining their last moments because
anybody who goes into this mass shooting
thing they certainly have to imagine it
before they do it
imagine yourself going in
with this really cool
somewhat military-ish looking gun
that you just love holding in your hand
i mean you just
you just love it
now if you're a female
or if you don't have an affinity for you
know let's say cool
cool objects you don't understand what
i'm saying
this may be harder for women to
understand and i'm going to be a little
a little uh over
over sexist here to make the point
obviously some women like guns
we're all adults right when i make a
general generalization about gender
in your head you should always say well
that's not everybody
obviously
it's not everybody right plenty of women
i'm sure
like the look and feel of a cool gun
that's a thing but i would say in
general
guys are more likely to like the just
the physicality of it just the coolness
of it
what happens if you take that away
it doesn't end all mass shootings of
course like i said somebody who's crazy
or has a motivation is just gonna get a
handgun or some other weapon
but i do think that people like this guy
this particular guy who had some mental
problems if you took away the coolness
factor
does it look the same
i just don't know if it looks the same
you've heard that
if all you have is a hammer everything
looks like a nail
if you build up a big military
don't you think you're more likely to
use it
than if you hadn't of course
you tend to use a tool just because you
have it
so if you have
you know a
awesome
somewhat military-ish looking gun not
really military
it's going to feel like you need to use
it
because you have it
and if you're not a hunter
and you have a bad day
and you've got this cool thing
one plus one and you get a bad situation
now i don't imagine that this would have
an effect on most mass shootings
because they're either you know
ideological or somebody's crazy or
whatever
but this guy probably wasn't so crazy
that he wouldn't be influenced by the
uh let's say the vibe of the whole
situation that makes him look kind of
awesome in his diseased mind
now somebody says nice mind reading so
it's not mind reading if you're talking
about people in general
mind reading would be if you're talking
about an individual
but if you're making a general statement
about how people act you can be pretty
safe about that relative to guessing
what one person thinks
um
now of course yeah i'm watching your
comments a lot of people are going crazy
on this no
they the numbers don't show that i don't
i'm not aware of any numbers
that would suggest one way or the other
i'm telling you that there's no way
the coolness of it has no effect i just
don't know how much
could it be five percent
ten percent
i would say that it's at least ten
percent
i don't think it's eighty percent
is it fifty percent
could be
could be i think it's less less than 50
percent but it could be
now i'll add one other factor the news
what would it look like
if the news did not report these and
almost always report that it's the same
kind of weapon
do you think that this uh guy
would have had this idea to be a
mass shooter at this grocery store
do you think you would have even thought
of it
except for the news
probably not
probably not
now so you need two things you need a
news they can't shut up about it
and you need a really cool weapon
and then you need somebody whose life is
not going well
apparently he couldn't get a girlfriend
he had some mental problems i don't
think his life was going to go that well
so
anyway
now this is all separate from whether
there should be gun control
okay i want you to hear this clearly
the question of whether there should be
gun control
opens up all kinds of other questions so
the the question is not just
if you made this change would it reduce
the number of shootings
you have to weigh that against freedom
and
you know protecting the country etc now
one of the things that people that i
often say about gun control and the
reason that i'm in favor of guns
is
that there's at least a small chance
that you have to protect yourself from
the government itself
and somebody said to me what are the
odds of that
we've been around 300 years or whatever
and and the country hasn't
you know fallen apart yet
do you really need those guns to protect
yourself against
the government of the united states
really
to which i say i don't think it's a big
chance
two percent
i would say the odds are
two percent
now if you say it's zero
i think you're not in intellectually
secure territory
so i think it's closer to a hundred
percent if you wait long enough it's
just how long you wait because
there are no dynasties that lasted
forever
that they all have a up evil
so
the odds of the united states of sunday
not being the united states is a hundred
percent it's just how long you wait is
it a thousand years or fifty years
so there is some chance
i would put the odds at just for
discussion purposes
two percent
two percent
this is just to do some math right you
don't have to agree with that number now
how would you
look at the
risk
of a two percent chance
of this big problem
you know like the the government turning
on the citizens
two percent
uh how would you rate that compared to
the deaths by guns well the deaths by
guns you can count
and you could say all right we get this
many thousand people per year
die from guns
what is a two percent risk
that the entire united states would be
you know devastated by a some civil war
or the the government would turn on the
people well you multiply 370 million
people
times two percent you get
you know
seven million people at risk now that
would be if the whole country was
fighting each other with weapons which
wouldn't happen but you very quickly
you very quickly this
by the way this type of analysis
is called an expected value you multiply
the odds of something happening
times the cost if it did happen now both
of these are guesses but it allows you
to at least
have some kind of rational comparison to
an alternative
so the alternative is what 30 000 people
a year die from guns in the united
states
but you've got a two percent chance of
preventing
millions from dying
millions
so i would say that that's worth it
to me as an insurance policy
against that two percent
in the short term
but really a hundred percent in the long
term
i'd say that's
a good uh insurance policy
um
yeah so 100 chance doesn't mean that
everybody dies
right and i didn't say that
100 chance is that there would be a lot
of upheaval
so
um let's say let's say a million people
died the civil
war let's say you did two percent of the
millions
all right
so
10 would be a hundred thousand
do the math all right
um
yeah i think the news plus the coolness
of the weapons are the two variables
that we won't talk about
but are at least a big part of it it's
not the whole story
um
i guess biden is talking about some
maybe using uh
his power of executive orders to do
something with um
with these weapons
and i'm thinking what kind of executive
order can you do about that
well i i'm still confused about the
uh the scope of executive orders like
when can you use them
how could you use an executive order
to make a constitutional right less
available
that feels like it feels like a
questionable thing to do
but maybe he can i don't know
um
so he hasn't ruled out the executive
orders
and i guess what they mostly want or
they're asking for is uh
background check improvements
i don't know why anybody disagrees with
background checks
and i don't know if this guy could have
been
stopped with a background check
but
here's the scariest thing you'll hear
today
do you believe that you could write a an
algorithm
that would detect somebody who is a
potential mass shooter before they do
the shooting
here's the things that could have been
detected about this shooter in denver
he's
he's concerned about islamophobia
he doesn't like trump
couldn't get a girlfriend
and there's some indication of mental
illness
now if they also had access to the fact
that he had recently bought a weapon
could there be any kind of algorithm
that could see all of those things
say a government algorithm that could
look into your financial
stuff and also look into your postings
and say wait a minute wait a minute
we've got a bad match here
here's a guy who's got sort of the
characteristics
that doesn't look safe
you know he doesn't have a happy life
little mental problems and he's got a
political motive
that's bad
and then he just bought this this
particular type of weapon
and there's nothing on his social media
to suggest he's a hunter
and there's nothing on his social media
to suggest he's just a second amendment
guy
right
do you think you couldn't write an
algorithm that would find the shooters
before they shot now you would find too
many people that's the problem right
you'd find way more people than actual
people who commit crimes
but i feel like we're heading that
direction
[Music]
hello
hello adams yes
good morning this is jack with today
capital how am i doing today oh i'm
great
but you know i don't need any capital
i understand that actually as a direct
lender we have 15 plus loan programs
where we don't need any guarantee no
personal issues so do you need any
additional capital for your business
yeah if you could send me a check that'd
be great
um
probably had more to say about that but
i guess i think he's gonna send me a
check
all right let's say uh
so everybody's talking about the
ethnicity of the shooter
and uh in the beginning
people like me and uh
people like uh
kamala harris's niece i think it was was
it her niece yeah her niece said well
it's probably a white guy with a with a
big weapon
you may recall that i said the same
thing
i think it's probably a white guy
as that has that feeling about it turns
out it wasn't um and yesterday i had
also
raised the question about
what his ethnicity might be because it
hasn't been released
the longer it takes them to release the
ethnicity the more you suspect it wasn't
a white guy
i feel like if it's a white guy you know
right away what the race is but people
were saying that since they took him
alive
he he must have been a white guy
but that didn't turn out to be the case
so everybody got to have their their
biases tested by the situation i got i
got my biases tested
um
now the bias is just in my case it was
statistical
i just thought statistically the odds
are good it was a white guy
and
but it wasn't
um i saw a quote from i think a
gentleman who lives in india if i if i'm
correctly
uh seeing that
and he he tweeted this he said this is
very brave um
uh
he just said it was brazen that they're
just openly discriminating against white
people now in the senate you probably
heard that tammy duckworth and
maisie hirona said they'll vote against
all biden nominees who are not
racial minorities
so these these stories end up becoming
the same story because every story just
turns into a racial filter
oh the shooter it's racial
yeah in the comments somebody's saying
the shooter was already on fbi radar
which means they already do have an
algorithm
apparently they do have an algorithm
that can put you on their radar just by
your social media traffic
and if they haven't yet bashed that
against
firearm purchases
why haven't they that seems like the
obvious thing to do
so amazingly two democratic senators
said that you can't that they won't vote
for white people
to fill these cabinet positions
and um
i almost don't know what to say about
that
they literally
won't vote for white people and they
said that out loud now i think it was
duckworth who may have you know pulled
that back a little bit
but
they would only make an exception if
you're lgbtq
which is an interesting exception
because if i were a nominee
and i were
an adult white guy who was qualified for
the office and i knew that tammy
duckworth and maisie hirono would not
vote for me unless i was if unless i
were lgbtq
i would become lgbtq
within minutes
because you just have to say you are
right
i'm not wrong about that
and
if you think i'm joking
no
no if i were the if i were a nominee and
now we're a white guy and i thought i
couldn't get the job because of my race
unless i were lgbtq
i would stand in front of the public
and say
uh you know i maybe i'm not naturally
leading that way
but as a lifestyle choice it is my right
to make it
and i declare myself to be gay
for the purposes of employment
and i i understand i don't have to
actually have sex with anybody
because you can be gay without the
actual sexual act obviously
you know heterosexuals who are not
having sex or still heterosexual
so i don't have to prove i'm gay
i just have to be
gay in my
personal preferences and
i would play it completely
ironically i would play it straight
i wouldn't joke
and i wouldn't say i was kidding no
matter how many people asked i would
look you right in the eye and say
yes
totally honest
i'm as gay as you can get
for the job
i'm doing it for the job
but i'm definitely gay
for the job
now this is uh
uh
one of my uh perma trolls somebody on
twitter called hampton stevens
you saw me tweeting about these issues
and
replying to somebody else who goes right
adams is going full-on white grievance
to which i tweeted in reply
yes
i am
our system works best with guard rails
in every direction and only the people
who can survive the blowback
have the ability to perform that public
task
you can sit it down if you're frightened
i understand
so i told my uh
my critic
that if he's frightened
to be part of this conversation i
understand
he has every right to be frightened
it's a it's a scary thing and only the
only people who can even talk about this
topic in public
are people who are bulletproof
and i'm kind of bulletproof
so
it's almost like this spider-man problem
which is
i don't really want to talk about this i
really don't i'm just not interested
but i'm the only one who can i mean not
the only one but there there's a small
number of people who can even talk about
this in public and not have their life
ruined
so i guess
i guess i'm one of them now
because i can
and it's important
uh full out racism in the senate
tom cotton pull you know called it down
as well on twitter
and i feel as if they should be removed
from the senate
like they should really be removed from
the senate
as in
all of the white people in the senate
should walk out until they are
if i were a white
straight republican
i would refuse to do service i would
refuse to do the work of the people
until they're gone
i wouldn't do any work of the public i
wouldn't do anything in the senate i
wouldn't look at i wouldn't look at a
nomination
i wouldn't even look at the nomination
i wouldn't even show up
until they get rid of these two people
because if you think there's something
more important than this that they're
working on
well you're wrong
this is the most important thing that
happened
in the country that has to get fixed
that people were openly racist in the
senate
and don't think there'll be
repercussions for that
so you need to play by their own game
which is if it's racist it's racist and
you have to deal with it it's the
biggest issue and this is really racist
this is like super racist
this is as racist as you can be
does anybody feel sorry for the white
people who will be victimized by this no
but you still can't
be racist it doesn't work in the long
run
now i've told you before the only way to
stop the the crazy brain damaged part of
the left
from
the slippery slope you know that just
goes forever into madness
um
is
uh aggressively agreeing with them
disagreeing with somebody who has brain
damage doesn't work
do you know why
it's sort of in the setup it's the brain
damage part
if they didn't have brain damage well
you could probably reasonable
but they do
so you can't
so you have to use persuasion not reason
and
i would say the way to do that would be
to embrace their policies and watch the
break
so that's happened with immigration
right
so the democrats got to try their
immigration plan
and got to see it didn't work and that
would be true of a lot of stuff they're
doing if they got their way
if the dog caught the car
it wouldn't know what to do with it
so sometimes you have to let the dog
catch the car and say all right dumbass
no what are you going to do with it chew
on the bumper
how's it taste
sometimes you have to let them get their
way because they're brain damaged
and just see what happens and then talk
to those cells out of it they can talk
themselves out of it that way
so
um that's why i think the gop should
just shut down the senate
because that's what the democrats would
do
if if there had been
uh let's say a gop member who had said
something that was
not just maybe a little racist
not just a dog whistle
but direct
if if some
white adult
republican had made a direct
racist statement like this
i think the democrats would just stop
the senate wouldn't they they would just
stop everything and say oh wait a minute
this is the biggest problem
nothing else is as big a problem as this
is these two people
have to be gone
be or we're not going to do any other
business
somebody's using the example of
representative king
king is an example of the the dog
whistle type
some people thought they heard it in his
words other people said he's just bad at
talking in public
it's not really there but you can
imagine it if you want to that's
different
the dog whistle stuff is a little bit
mind-reading and you have to assume you
know what they're thinking and you can't
but if somebody says it directly
as duckworth and hirona did
you have to stop the senate and fix that
nothing else matters today you gotta fix
it
so
um
the other way to go
would be for the gop to embrace it
and use the aggressive agreeing idea
imagine if you will that the gop
introduced some legislation
to ban white men from serving in the
senate from that point on
or serving in a cabinet position
uh from that point on
what would you do
what would happen if the gop said well
let's take your lead
duckworth and ronnie we're going to put
together a bill that says that white
people can't serve in government
what would happen
because if they disagree with the idea
it's just another disagreement it means
nothing but what would happen if they
said yeah let's let's take this to where
you wanted to be
let's let's put it into law
and then put all the democrats on record
to see if they'd vote for it
see if they'll vote for it
put them on record see how many
democrats will vote that no white people
can serve in the government
you like it don't you
so
this is why i could never be in the
senate because i would just be trolling
the other side because
non-stop
all right um
purge the whites
uh yeah schumer wouldn't put it on the
calendar
well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
if it gets voted on it matters if they
would do it because it would it would be
a news
uh
attractor
that makes you overqualified for the
senate
yeah you definitely wouldn't want me in
the senate
although that would be fun maybe the
senate would be better than being
president because i could i could cause
more trouble in the senate
there's so brain damage they would
probably vote for it yeah but you were
really going for the other half of the
democrats who are not brain damaged they
just have different policy preferences
all right
that's all i got for now
and follow me on locals i'm doing lots
of stuff on reframing
so i've discovered that people like best
my lessons on reframing how to look at
the stuff you're already looking at
in a different way so that you can you
can deal with it more productively so
i'm putting up more reframing lessons on
there
and
um
i've been asked a number of times lately
by my critics
to explain how i was so sure
that uh
trump would win the election
even after the election because i was i
was uh suggesting that there might be
some improprieties discovered
and people say well i guess you're wrong
to which i say
am i
am i wrong
we only know that it hasn't been checked
how do you how do you
how do you
know i'm wrong
on the thing you haven't checked
because that's the whole point isn't it
now we know that the courts did not
overrule anything we know that biden's
in office i'm not arguing any of that
i'm just saying
you don't know if i'm wrong
you just know we didn't check
so i tweeted the other day that
sometimes you think i'm wrong but really
you just haven't waited long enough
that's one of these
um
i cannot
can we get a simultaneous sip every time
you speak publicly
well i don't know if you've noticed but
i've
stopped speaking publicly has anybody
noticed
i just stopped taking uh interviews
i'm going to be doing
unless it gets
unless it gets postponed i'm going to be
doing a clubhouse
event a little later this morning
and i haven't been on clubhouse yet i
just signed up just playing with it this
morning and i'm going to be
if if this happens i think it's going to
happen i'm going to be defending the
indefensible
so i'm going to
i'm going to be picking a topic which
can't be defended
and then i'm going to defend it anyway
and i'm going to have a guest a
controversial guest
controversial oh yeah
really controversial
so
look for that unless it gets postponed
and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
i just saw
i just saw a comment go by that says the
beatles of the best band ever
i am totally obsessed at looking at old
beatles videos and stories and learning
about how they succeeded
because that's really interesting and
when you see that they had
systems
so the beatles had systems they didn't
have goals and when you look at their
systems
it becomes
somewhat
almost obvious why they succeeded they
just had better systems
and i'll give you one example one
example would be when they were writing
a song
different band members would have like
little bits of ideas of things
for that are completely different
and the beatles would say well if your
little bit
is awesome but you you couldn't build a
whole song around it and then you know
if george has a little bit that's
awesome
why don't we just put the bits together
and we'll make a song
of all the random bits
and then you think well what about the
the vocals you know
and the vocals well we'll just do random
sentences
what
you're going to make music that is
random vocals that literally don't mean
anything
and your song will be a hodgepodge of
different things that you just like that
just were put together
and that's what they did
and it turns out that that's a better
system because people like music where
they like all the good parts you've
noticed that a lot of modern music has
the
you might have the hip-hop artist with
maybe you know rihanna or somebody
rhiannon somebody who can sing
and then you get a little bit of you
know rap and a little bit of
singing and you kind of like it
because i liked a little bit of that a
little bit there
so the beatles sort of pioneered putting
things together they shouldn't be
together sort of the pineapple on the
pizza sort of thing and they did tons of
experimenting
and tons of practice and they they took
it from the
they were stifled doing live
performances because they couldn't hear
themselves the crowds were too loud
and so they
changed their system and they moved to
the studio
and started making sounds that you'd
never heard before so another part of
their system is
they would mic their equipment
differently than other people i think in
one case
a piano was microphoned underneath it
they would
they would have different devices that
nobody else used different sounds
and they would just
make music out of sounds
so
once you dig into what the beatles did
systems wise
it's pretty impressive so it's not
exactly an accident that they succeeded
i mean their talent was off the charts
and they had exactly the right people
but their systems were amazing
that's the real story of it all right
that's all for now talk to you tomorrow
