hey everybody
come on in it is delightful to see you
all
i know you're coming here because
it's the best time of the day every
single time
and one way you can know it will be an
incredible day
is if you have the simultaneous sip yeah
it's pretty much guaranteed
if you do that and all you need is a
copper mug or glass of tankard
chalice or stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better except statistics
it's called the simultaneous hip and it
happens now
go
ah i can feel my
benford curve bending can't you
yeah well there's an allegation that
cnn got rid of its uh
coveted banner
do you think that's true because i don't
know if they use
the cove encounter on every single story
all the time
anyway so are we only imagining that
they suddenly took down the
coveted death count because i feel as
though that wasn't for every story all
the time
they just put it up now and then so i
got a feeling that's fake news
but we'll talk about some other fake
news and some real ones
a company called celex a biotech company
and
gauss who's a computer vision startup
they announced that they have got
approval for an at-home corona virus
test
that has sensitivities of
94 and specificity
of 97 percent now i'm not going to get
into the technical difference between
the
sensitivity and the specificity one has
to do with finding the virus the other
has to do with finding antibodies i
think
but the point is that these are
sensitive enough
that if you had a lot of these and
people had them at home and they could
test it themselves
i think it comes with this little
inexpensive device
that that comes with the test kit or
something that's how they make it cheap
but isn't it great
that vice president-elect biden is
getting so much done
so now he's got a vaccine and it looks
like
vice president elect biden
now has a cheap at-home test those were
the two things we needed to get past
coronavirus and it only took vice
president-elect
one week to get all of that done
so jokes on president trump for doing
absolutely nothing for four years and
then
biden comes in one week one week he's
got this whole pandemic under control
so i guess a pretty good deal here's
some more fake news
if you saw on social media that real
clear politics
had decided to take pennsylvania out of
the
biden column and put it into the
undecided column
uh i fell for that one i even retweeted
that one
fake news fake news never happened
uh it turns out the real clear politics
never had pennsylvania as decided in the
first place
so there was nothing to reverse just
somebody noticed it wasn't there
and assumed it had been reversed but
they just had
kept it undecided another fake news
is also saw on i think only on social
media
that uh bret baier deleted a tweet
because it got so much pushback and
fox news hatred and the tweet that he
deleted that got all of this
fox news hatred was him just tweeting
that he'll be on
uh he'll be on tonight with martha
mccallum
and that was it his entire tweet was
i'll be on at you know x time with
martha mccall
but in the comments there were just you
know reams of
fox news hatred because mostly because
of the arizona
calling that for biden in what people
thought was too early
and then bret baer deleted the tweet and
it gets reported as
as if he deleted it because
of all the bad feedback but
fake news fake news in my opinion is
fake news
because even this morning i tweeted that
same kind of tweet
which i will delete as soon as we're
done here
because my tweet said something about my
uh today's episode of this
so if i leave that tweet up until
tomorrow it will look like i'm referring
to tomorrow as today
so of course i will delete it all brad
bear did was delete a tweet
that should be deleted because it times
out
because it's talking about today you
don't leave a tweet up that talks about
today
after today it would be
misleading so you know i can't read
bret bear's mind and know whether he
deleted it because of all the bad
comments
but i know that if he didn't delete it
just as a matter of course because it is
a deletable tweet that should be deleted
on the next day
i'd be surprised all right so that's
your little bit of fake news there
um fox news also reported that uh
bill barr attorney general has given the
green light
for the the department of justice to
look into
election mischief
and here's how fox news couched that
blah blah even though little evidence of
fraud has been put forth
is that do you find that that to be a
true statement
would you say it's true that quote
uh little evidence of fraud has been put
forth
would you say that's a true statement
that feels like
an opinion doesn't it because how much
is
how much is a lot how much is a little
if you've been looking at the the
statistical arguments
you mostly will or maybe only will
mostly i think we'll see it on social
media you won't see it on the news so
much
now i would assume that a lot of those
statistical arguments
when you dig into them you might find
out that they don't hold up
that's what i would expect just in
general any kind of claims in this
situation are not going to hold up in
the long run
it wouldn't matter if the roles were
reversed it wouldn't matter what the
claim is
almost you know a lot of things won't
hold up in the long run
but there are a lot of them
wouldn't you say when you say that there
are a lot of
statistical claims and that
they haven't been debunked that doesn't
mean that they won't be debunked
but what we're talking about now is is
there evidence enough
that professionals should get involved
looking into it
we're not saying that something's been
proven already
that's the whole point of having the
professionals look into it
to see if there's anything that can be
or should be proven
so is it accurate to say that there's
little evidence i would say that there's
a lot of evidence that's been presented
but it has not been confirmed wouldn't
that be more accurate
plenty of allegations plenty of evidence
presented
mostly in the statistical sense
but not confirmed isn't that exactly why
you have the
department of justice look into it
yeah it seems to me there are plenty of
claims whether they hold up
is a separate question all right joe
biden could set
a weird record by becoming president
if in fact he becomes president
so every time i talk about
president-elect joe biden or joe biden
being president
run a little uh recording in your head
that says
but you know it's not official and it
could well be reversed
and there's a pretty good chance it will
be so play that
in your head every time you hear me
talking about joe biden okay
it could be reversed it probably will be
well i don't know if it probably will be
but there's a good chance
um but here's the weird record he could
have
he could get the most votes in absolute
numbers you get the most votes of
anybody ever elect a president
while simultaneously having the lowest
approval
of any president now
i say you have the lowest approval level
without
without regard to anything he actually
does
because can you say with some certainty
that republicans will say he's doing a
bad job
yes of course exactly as though
as you could say if a republican is
president you could count on just about
all of the democrats saying
that republican is doing a bad job but
what's different is that
while trump consolidated republicans
he had something like i don't know 96 96
percent support
it looks like biden's going to be going
in with a split
democratic party you know the the
extremists if you will the progressives
and the
the moderates so if you imagine that the
half or let's say a third of the
democratic party
will be unhappy with joe biden because
he's not extreme enough
and hundred percent or something like it
of the republicans will be against him
doesn't that get you down to the lowest
job approval
of all time while also simultaneously
getting the most
votes for president that's going to
happen right
i mean almost certainly that's going to
happen i don't know how it could be
avoided
so i think we'll see biden approvals in
the
low 40s eventually you know you'll have
a little honeymoon period perhaps
maybe this will be the time there is no
honeymoon period but i would expect it
to drift into the low 40s
and i don't think it will ever get
anywhere near
trump approval levels if
biden becomes president which is by no
means
certain certainly has not been
determined and there's a good chance it
won't happen
um all right
um here's an interesting question which
i think should be
posed to democrats it goes like this
if you believed that trump was an
existential threat and you believed he
was a hitler-like
character and don't you feel that
democrats would say they do believe that
and did believe that that trump is not
an ordinary republican but rather an
existential threat
and a hitler-like menace to the world if
not the country
now if you believe that and you're
willing to say that in public
yes i believe that is true how do you
defend
not trying to rig the election if that
is also your claim that it was not
rigged
how in the world could you be a moral
ethical
good person and you wouldn't try to rig
the election
to keep hitler out of office because let
me tell you i would try to rig that
election
i would risk jail to keep an existential
threat
and a hitler out of office why wouldn't
you if you put me in that situation i'm
either going to say
well it's not that bad he's not actually
hitler
or if i say that he is hitler
and i believe it i'm going to act on it
you don't not act on hitler
now granted not every person is going to
act on everything
but shouldn't you expect the democrats
as a group would have plenty of people
who would say whoa this is not like
other
elections this is not like every other
year
we've got to go here and i
i just realized i might be wearing my
shirt backwards
just ignore the fact that my shirt is
inside out
not not backwards inside out act like
you don't even see it
if you're watching if you're just
listening to this on the podcast
you can't see the video there's nothing
wrong with my shirt
it is i'm wearing my shirt completely
correctly
so anyway democrats have some weird
cognitive dissonance trigger here
because if they didn't try to rig the
election
they're either liars or cowards or
there's something going on that we don't
understand
maybe there's some other explanation
all right now you're obsessed with my
shirt so you won't hear anything else i
say
all right one one pushback i saw
from somebody who tried to argue against
the statistical arguments
about the election being rigged now the
statistical arguments if you haven't
heard them
there it's a variety of different
arguments about different things
that all have the same quality which is
this couldn't have happened by itself
meaning that some of the some of the
argument is that
there are more people who voted than has
ever voted
as a percentage of the population you
know by a lot
so much so that the odds of that it
really happened
are not zero
but really close to zero but you could
say to yourself well
that's just one thing it is natural
that if you're looking at a lot of
different statistics some of them are
going to be weird
because that's how statistics work and
here's an argument
that i saw online from just random
twitter user
but i thought it was interesting enough
to talk about and he said that
the statistical arguments are are
cherry-picking
and his argument is this you could find
uh if you cherry-picked and looked for
them you could find places where the
vote was
unusual for republicans in other words
you could find a city
where the republican vote was way on a
line or the number of people who voted
doesn't make sense
do you believe that now i don't know
that anybody's looked for that
but if they did look do you believe that
they would find
also statistical anomalies that go in
the other direction
not a bad comment is it if we're trying
to be rational here
you know and i i try to try to create
let's say a culture if you will for my
live streams
that you're not going to be dogmatic and
just agree with your team on every
single thing
because that's sort of not what we do
here
so if you're being objective
and you saw a whole bunch of statistical
claims made by one side
against the other but you hadn't seen
the full context
how certain should you be that those
statistical claims
could not have been made in the other
direction if somebody just looked for
them
it's a pretty good comment isn't it
right
no not really because there's a second
layer
to the claims the claims are not simply
hey we found some cities and some
locations
that have some anomalies if that were
the only claim
then it would be a perfectly good
debunking to say
there are always anomalies there will be
anomalies in the other direction there's
going to be some anomalies this way
every year you looked at it there would
be anomalies any other situation you
looked at
that was big and complicated you would
see a statistical
you know distribution where there's a
little bit of natural clustering
and it wouldn't mean a thing it would
just mean that you picked these ones
that are anomalies and there are always
anomalies
right except for the other layer
the anomalies that worked against the
republicans
happen to happen happen to occur in all
the right places so it's that second
level
of coincidence that takes it to
okay this isn't just cherry picking
probably
right now you and i have not dug into it
you and i are not probably
not statistical experts so we could find
out
anything in the long run but the the
claim that a statistical anomaly will
happen or lots of them will happen
in both directions is fair
but when you add that extra layer that
why'd they only happen in these places
exactly the places that they needed to
happen once you add that second layer of
coincidence
if the claim holds up and again i'm not
the one who looked into it personally
i'm just reading claims but if those
claims hold up
it's going to be hard for to explain
that as a
coincidence all right um
i don't know why i'm gonna mention this
and i probably shouldn't
but you know you get something in your
head and you can't get it on your head
until you say it out loud
you ever had that situation there's just
a random thing that's not too important
and it's rolling around in your head
but damn it if you don't say it out loud
eventually it'll just keep rolling
around in there until you get it out of
there so i'm going to do that
i will ask your indulgence for a point
that has no rel
relevance to anything and it goes like
this
maybe we live in a simulation because
if you were a victim and this is why i
didn't want to mention it if you're a
victim of sexual assault
what professional are you likely to
pay to help you if you've had
if you've been the victim of a sexual
assault now of course there's the legal
system
but you but that's separate you
wouldn't necessarily be paying for that
that would be a public service
uh but who would you pay you'd probably
pay somebody called a therapist
yeah it's you're way ahead of me what
are the odds that the people who
are the victims of sexual assault are
almost have to because it would mess
with your mind
would have to see a professional whose
name is a therapist which is literally
the words
the rapist put together
i mean you can't even laugh at that
because the the topic is ugly right you
can't make fun of sexual assault
but what are the what are the odds that
the one job
that deals with people who are yeah and
fairly frequently right i would i would
imagine if you're a therapist
probably i don't know 40 to 60 percent
of your business
is people who are victims of sexual
assault mad big deal
has a lot to do with why they're feeling
the way they feel
that's just creepy and crazy and they
need to change their name
honestly because i don't think if i had
been a victim of that particular crime
that i could ever see the word therapist
and feel okay with it
i would always see always see the part
that comes after
the always
i mean literally you should just change
the name of your business you should be
a
something not a therapist all right
are you ready for your red pill of the
moment
here it comes the moment you've been
waiting for the reason that you joined
me here
on coffee with scott adams the thought
that you did not have on your own
until you heard it from me and it goes
like this
remember i always tell you to look for
what's happening
but if you want to understand the
situation also
look for what's not happening which is
called the dog
that isn't barking from sherlock holmes
reference
so if there's a dog they should have
been barking because the allegation is
that there was a
intruder in the backyard and that dog
doesn't bark
you have to ask yourself why is there a
lack of
facts here and here is the dog that's
not
barking about this election and it comes
in the form of
top statistical experts who are
democrats
who are looking at the statistical
arguments coming out of the
the weaponized autism on the right
and they're making quite a few claims
about statistical irregularities
that could not happen naturally what is
the most
logical ordinary thing you would expect
to happen given that the left is
completely unified and saying that none
of that
mischief happened or if it did it was
trivial
so isn't the most
logical thing that cnn would do
given that this claim of impropriety is
so big
and it seems to be at least at this
point based primarily on
statistical observation plus there are a
bunch of witnesses who have signed
affidavits
but you know we'll get to them next but
there's a statistical thing
so wouldn't you expect that the top
statistical minds who are anti-trump
would be all over cnn and all over msnbc
and they would say you know this benford
analysis
that's not really a thing right or
they'd say you know this benford
analysis
it is a thing but they use the wrong
data
or maybe the data isn't reliable or
something
wouldn't you expect that since the
biggest
issue in the world is hey these
statistics show there was a gigantic
fraud
big enough to change the election don't
you need to get your experts in there to
talk against that
you do don't you and it's kind of
missing isn't it
now did you notice it was missing until
i just brought it up so here's your
here's your uh your check on yourself
if you didn't notice this until i
brought it up
there there's a mental um let's say
method that you're lacking and the
mental method you're lacking is you
should
every now and then almost like there's a
timer set in your brain
say wait a minute is there anything
missing here
that you would naturally see here if if
you knew what should be here is there
anything missing
that should be part of your mental habit
to just always
because because you won't be and here's
the the hard part
you won't be triggered to look for
something that isn't there
because that's the point there's nothing
to trigger you
it's simply a lack of something so
there's nothing to remind you to look
for the nothing
because there's no trigger for nothing
so you gotta you gotta really
force yourself all right all right is
there something that should be happening
that's
missing and then you can maybe find it
now
uh full disclosure
i didn't think of that thought until i
saw somebody else say it on twitter
today
so i stole the thought and i'm the one
who teaches you that you should do this
and even i didn't do it and as soon as i
i saw that
from somebody i wish i had gotten the
name but
i would give i would give credit to who
who
inspired this thought but i didn't write
it down so i'm a bad person
um well you know who you are if you're
watching this
live stream i saw your tweet and i got
it from you so you can claim credit
um but keep watching for that
every day that goes by the cnn and
the other media do not have a
statistical expert debunking it
means something it does mean something
it's not confirmation but it certainly
pushes you in that direction i'm going
to brag a little bit about my tweet on
this very topic
because i like the way i worded it so
i'll share it with you it's the same
same point i just worded it differently
i said in my tweet do you hear that dog
that isn't barking
it's the top statistical experts on the
left
who are looking at election rigging
allegations
and coming to a slow boil in their own
flop sweat
so i was pretty proud of that sentence
um i think we should you know there's a
lot of
a lot of uh questions and skepticism
about
a software product or i don't know if
it's a company name or the software name
called dominion apparently this software
company controls the
the technology for a number of different
states and locales
and a lot of questions have been asked
about this dominion
software and i thought you know if we
can't solve this
with the technical people we should have
some kind of a national
vote to see if we should keep the
dominion software
to oh wait that won't work
okay never mind i guess we don't have a
way to do a national vote
about whether our national voting
software is credible
because who who would believe the output
of a national vote
about our software that controls the
national vote
all right expect this play coming up
this will be what uh
i use cnn as my stand-in for you know
the
the fake news on the left so it's not
just cnn
but you're going to see what i call the
wrong debunk play
so you've got all these claims about uh
specific
allegations that the election was not
fair
do you think that cnn will pick the
strongest points this is what i always
recommend if somebody gives you a
laundry
list of reasons just ask for the
strongest point
and debunk that one and then if you
debunk the strongest point
just say yeah the rest of your stuff is
worse than that one i already debunked
that one
and walk away but here's another play
that you can do with the laundry list
so the republicans have offered a
laundry list of alleged
uh mischief with this election here's
so let's say i'm just making up this
number by the way but let's say the gop
says we have 25 statistical arguments
for why the vote was rigged
it'll be some number i made up 25. what
will the democrats
say to that you can predict this with
complete certainty
they will misinterpret some of the
claims
and they will debunk their own
misinterpretation of the claims
and then they will ignore the other
claims
the good ones so they'll pick ones that
are either the weakest ones to debunk
or they'll misinterpret a strong one and
debunk their misinterpretation
but they'll do about three of them if
there are 24
and then cnn will report what will
what will be the words the cnn would
report under the
example i just gave 25 statistical
claims with backing
from the republicans and then the
democrats misinterpret
three of them and debunk their own
misinterpretation
of just three of them and the 25 this is
the hypothetical here
this is not news this is hypothetical
what would cnn
report under that scenario
baseless exactly i'm seeing it in the
comments you're all there first
they would say it's been debunked it's
baseless
and no evidence has been offered
and it's a and it's a baseless
conspiracy theory
you know that's coming a hundred percent
chance
you can see the play coming and the
reason that you can see it coming
and it doesn't matter is that it will
work
it will work now that doesn't mean it'll
be the final word
but it will be persuasive it will
convince
democrats um
deray mckesson who's a black lives
matter activist
he won a supreme court ruling
apparently he was being sued but for
being an
organizer of a protest in which some
other person who was not
deray threw a i know a brick or a rock
or something at a police officer and
caused brain damage
loss of teeth and a head injury so you
know a major
life problem there forever for that
police officer
pretty tragic but i guess the supreme
court ruled that as the organizer you
are not
responsible for the actions of
individuals who get organized
and i think it probably has to be that
way i was i don't see any way that you
can hold the
a free speech organizer responsible for
what the
individuals do so i get that it has to
be that way so i would agree with the
supreme court
i think they got the ruling right but
i feel as if if you organize something
in which you know there will be violence
but you don't know the specific violence
and you're not the one
through the rock at some point we need
to be smarter about this
because organizing events that guarantee
somebody is going to get hurt
i don't know maybe we could do better i
don't know i don't have an idea but i
feel like we could do better
now one of the things that's weird about
this situation we're seeing with the
election
is that you don't you don't often
have a situation where you're being
brainwashed
and you know it while it's happening
sometimes you can look back and say wait
a minute
i did the i did the pledge of allegiance
every day when i was a kid without even
questioning it hey i was being
brainwashed
so often you can see it in in the
history
but you don't often feel it while it's
happening to you
in the moment and that's what we're
feeling right now we're feeling in the
moment
that uh oh somebody i think somebody's
correcting me in the comments
that the deray mckesson thing might have
been a civil action
if that makes a difference to the story
um it might
but anyway back to brainwashing we are
being uh the country is being
brainwashed right now and i don't use
that word
figuratively the the everything from
uh intelligence professionals not
necessarily actively working
but the news business and democrats are
working together it's very obvious now
i think i can say that with with
certainty yeah as opposed to an
allegation
that they do work together they
coordinate
whether or not they have meetings to
coordinate they obviously coordinate
messaging
etc and that they are brainwashing the
public to accept
this this outcome now when i say
brainwashing
um they are not really dealing with the
facts of whether it was
fraudulent or not or how much it was
fraudulent but they're literally telling
people that they're bad people for being
skeptical of the outcome
that you're actually a bad person if you
don't believe the outcome
and you spread rumors that you don't
believe it
and that worse that you will be held to
account
for doubting it now my i just got
a message that my battery on my device
is down to 10
i'm going to try to rush to the end here
if it cuts off
uh it would only cut off on youtube
first uh you'll know what happened i
won't be back because i'm almost done
penn gillette uh penned an article i
love penn jillette by the way i got to
hang out with him once in vegas
after his show great guy i love penn
jillette
and also a a great patriot i would say
he adds a lot to the country so he made
a case
um that he he wasn't so much pro
joe biden as he was you know he wanted a
you know a better world i guess and he
wants one thing for joe biden to do
and i would say this is a very
kind productive good thing to ask for
and he's asking for
the joe biden to help help
them love all the trump supporters so
penn gillette
is anti-trump but he's asking as the
number one
priority to get for joe biden to help
democrats love trump's supporters
despite whatever they think about them
i'm not there you know i love penn
gillette i like
that i like the uh the thought the
emotion the philosophy behind what he's
asking for
but he has a blind spot and the blind
spot goes like this
joe biden called trump supporters by
implication
racists for the last year because he led
his campaign with that stupid fine
people hoax
which makes anybody who backs somebody
who had said
if trump had backed the neo-nazis if you
were to back
trump after he it's fake news but after
they say he backed the neo-nazis well
you would be kind of a racist
or a neo-nazi and i don't think that
democrats quite
understand what happened i don't think
they
understand what happened to republicans
and what happened to trump supporters be
they republican or not
i don't think they know that you don't
get over that
that's not in the category of things you
get over let me give you
an example of something you get over hey
you're stupid
i could get over that you made a dumb
choice i could get over that
you you choose all the wrong policies
you dumb
ignorant guy i could get over that
but after a year of the the standard
bearer for your party
calling me a racist effectively by
saying
the fine people oaks that's not
that's not like those other things that
is unforgivable
period it is unforgivable joe biden
you're not a nice person you're one of
the worst
people that i've ever seen in the public
arena
because i feel like you knew that wasn't
true
and if you didn't know it wasn't true
you're really incompetent
because it's pretty easy to know that
wasn't true so
i i'm just going to speak for myself i
don't plan to get over it
i don't plan to accept any of their love
if they are so kind as to forgive me for
for my actions um
i believe yeah and and it was racist so
i think
joe biden is a horrible person and i
mean that sincerely
i mean that as a human being forget
about the politics forget about
democrats
versus republicans as a human being he's
really a deeply
horrible person and i mean that
sincerely and that's not going to change
i am not ever going to forgive
this last year now if there are people
who say uh
same thing about trump and he did this
or that
you know you're welcome to your opinion
but don't even
don't even ask me do not think that joe
biden is a horrible human being
even if he turns out to be a good
president you know anything's possible
could be that the republican senate
keeps him in the middle
something good happens there you never
know but as a human
he is despicable just a horrible
horrible person really one of the worst
i'm going to be honest one of the worst
people
of all time is you know he's not even
just in the
slightly annoying category he's one of
the worst people of all time
with what he did in this past year it's
fresh
you know and by the way have you ever
heard me
complain about his 1990 whatever for
crime bill have you ever heard me
complain about that
i don't because i give everybody a pass
for what they did 20 years ago and maybe
it made sense 20 years ago
it's just not it wasn't part of anything
i thought was impossible
or important and he's also said it was a
mistake
so i'm very forgiving for somebody who
said i made a mistake 20 years ago and
i wish i hadn't totally forgiving for
that
but this is fresh he's still saying it
today
i mean if he asked him he'd repeat it
again today
that person is a horrible horrible
person
let's see what would be your theory if
you were a democrat
for why there seems to be massive
allegations of fraud
this year but we have not had these
massive allegations of frauds in
presidential elections recently
right so why would it just be this year
if you're a democrat
how do you explain it well i think the
way they're explaining it is that the
republicans are just making it up
right they would the the only way they
could explain
what they're observing is to imagine
that the
republicans are just making it up and it
didn't really happen or if it happened
it was
some low-grade stuff not enough to
change any outcome
so that's probably the the democrat view
now as i've told you
the biggest mistake that people make in
their thinking about other people
is to imagine that people think like you
do
because we don't people are thinking
very differently
let me tell you what i think explains
our observation
that the republicans are claiming
massive fraud this time
but it doesn't seem to have been
something that people complained about
in the past
here it goes we've never had an election
with this much fraud
now you would say to yourself but scott
scott scott people care about every
election
why wouldn't there have been as much
fraud last time
i mean people cared about hillary
clearly
and here's my hypothesis
my hypothesis is that there is pretty
bad fraud in every election
and that we just don't care because it
we
can't tell if it changed the election we
have some sense that both parties are
doing it
at least at the local level right if
there's anybody on here who says only
democrats
play with elections at the local level
you need to maybe look into that a
little bit
because my guess is that at the local
level
always has been some amount of fraud
but we kind of got used to it it became
like our baseline
it's like yeah it might have determined
the election
for example they would say some
historians would say that kennedy's
election
probably turned on fraud i think you
would see the same claim for
at least a few other elections in the
past probably some
senate elections etc but what is
different about this time
is that the media had decided that
trump was hitler and so the motivation
for fraud was through the roof
right but again i tell you even if you
thought he was hitler
probably every election the side
wanted their side to win and wanted it
badly so even if they thought he was
hitler
the people who actually could rig an
election
they probably had all the motivation
they needed every other year too
right you don't need to stop hitler if
you just want your person to win
that's probably enough to cheat but why
would there be so much
more cheating hypothetically if that
happened
why would there be so much more this
year is it just because
trump is extra bad here's my hypothesis
this is the first year that the cheaters
could be sure
that the press would cover for them
you feel that in any prior year
you couldn't be sure that the press
would cover your tracks
because even cnn in a prior election and
you know
years gone by i feel like they would
have covered the story
they would have said here's a story we
don't know if it's true but there's this
big
allegations of mischief we're going to
put some of our reporters on it too
and they'll dig in a little bit too so
we'll we'll not only report the story
but we'll dig into it because it's a
pretty important thing
but if you were going to cheat in this
election
you could know with complete confidence
that
even if you were detected which looks
exactly like what happened
the press would tell the country it
didn't happen
and you could just walk and like
likewise there probably are lots of
local law enforcement type people
who are enough pro-biden or anti-trump
to simply look the other way so i don't
think there's ever been an election
where you had this much motivation but
again i don't think it was the
motivation
that was the the key variable i think
the key variable is knowing that this is
the first year
there's no chance of going to jail
that that you can just do whatever you
want and the press will cover your
tracks
so that's my that's my explanation of
observation
doesn't mean it's right but it explains
our observation
um and then i have this question for you
if you have a situation where the press
that seems to be the dominant press
is on the same team as one of the
political parties
and that's clearly the case the press is
on the the side of the democrats
why do you need press anymore what would
be the purpose
of the press in a situation where
they're siding with one of the teams
there's no point the press has actually
become irrelevant
because they took a side the moment they
take a side
they don't have any point there's just
no point to having a press
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you
tomorrow okay youtubers i've turned off
periscope i probably have
two percent uh battery left on this
device
and uh yeah the press is brainwashing
that is correct you know as a student of
persuasion
there is i am fascinated
by watching this major national psyop
and i also said uh i don't remember if i
said this in a
tweet or said it yesterday on periscope
but you can
you can see the network of operatives by
which ones
are doing what so if you see
jake tapper telling the same story that
say
john brennan would want you to hear you
might you might imagine that
they may not be directly connected but
they're operating with the same set of
operation manuals if you will so
that's all we got uh yeah sydney powell
is being very interesting right now
because she's making
the most aggressive claims about the
election being
being rigged now one of the reasons that
i think that
the republicans are able to go full-on
claims of rigging the election
is i think that trump can simply do
things that regular
republicans can't because i think if
you're a regular
republican you don't want the election
to be looked at too closely
because you know there's going to be
some republican mischief in that bunch
too
and maybe you're just like ah they
cheated better than we did this year
we'll get them next year so i got a
feeling that you'd have to be
trump to even open up the question of
whether this
election was rigged because i got a
feeling they're mostly rigged
and maybe always have been it's just
nobody wanted to look into them
all right that's all for now talk to you
tomorrow
