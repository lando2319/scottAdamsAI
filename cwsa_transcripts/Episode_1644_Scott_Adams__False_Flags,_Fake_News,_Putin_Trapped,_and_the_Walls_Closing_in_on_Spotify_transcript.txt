[Music]
good morning everybody
and welcome to
undoubtedly
the finest experience
of your entire life it's called coffee
with scott adams and
it's the only thing that gets better
every time
and if you would like to become part of
this movement that's
sweeping the planet
what do you need well the requirements
are embarrassingly low
all you need is a copper mug or glass a
tanker jealous for steiner canty jugger
flask a vessel
of any kind
a canadian trucker
well i guess the truck not the trucker
i suppose you could put liquid inside a
trucker
but then you wouldn't want to get it out
well let's just stick with a copper mug
or whatever this is
and join me now in the
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day
it's
it's the thing that forgets to put on
his microphone
it's called the simultaneous step
go
ah
you know i should have this
before i got ready because
you know once you've had your
simultaneous sip everything just starts
to fall into place
it's sort of like the tumblers on a safe
you can almost feel it can't you
all right
number one
um
i guess josh hawley
in the senate is urging the biden
administration to
forget about putting ukraine in nato
should they ever qualify they're not
qualified at the moment anyway
but
what do you think about that what do you
think about
promising putin that we won't do the
thing that we probably didn't want to do
anyway
i have mixed feelings about it
so let's let's talk it through
number one
i too had once said why don't we just
give him what he wants because what he
wants is nothing that we care about
anyway
which is
he doesn't want nato in ukraine
ukraine is too corrupt for us to allow
it to be part of nato anyway
it doesn't look like it's going to
change anytime soon
why not just give what he wants and then
say okay you have what you want
and we could take it back at any time
should he keep his army there we could
say whoa
that wasn't the deal
now we're going to let ukraine in nato
you bastard
so it seemed to me like we could give
him
literally nothing
because it wasn't anything we wanted
anyway
and
it would embarrass him into having to
withdraw or at least respond in some way
but
then i watched the biden administration
surprisingly offer absolutely nothing
and it looked like it worked
and i thought to myself you know
if biden actually gets away with this
it's it's too early to say but i'm
willing to imagine
that it was the right play
just say how about we give you nothing
and how about we call your bluff
and how about your 100 000 troops aren't
going to take a step into this territory
because you know it would be worse for
you than if you did because i do think
putin knows it would be bad for him to
do that
what do you think
i mean none of us can read putin's mind
right so we're all guessing but i don't
think we can guess any worse than the
intelligence agencies do you oh let's do
a little experiment here
so you've probably seen experiments
where a group of people are asked a
question i'll give you an example i was
once in some kind of a class i forget
what they were teaching and people were
asked to
guess on average how many credit cards
each person had
on average
and of course since you don't know
anything about the other person's
belongings there were strangers in the
class
we all put in our guesses and the
guesses were like crazy
it was everything from you know one to
nine
you know people were guessing that the
average person had nine credit cards it
but you take all these crazy guesses and
then you average amount
and then we actually took our credit
card cards out and counted them and took
the average
it was like amazingly close
so it's one of those wisdom of crowds
things i guess you can repeat that
experiment and it works it works enough
that it was part of the class
and and so i wonder
if you were trying to anticipate what
putin would do
would you do better if you had all your
your sources and methods
because probably putin hasn't made up
his mind right so even if he had sources
and methods and you got you got
information that was 10 minutes old
who would be useless if he's changing
his mind all the time
so let's try the wisdom of crowds
the hypothesis is this
that the average of us just watching
this right now
probably could guess what he would do
just a hypothesis there's no reason to
believe it's true
uh just for fun
so here's my here's my take and then you
can add yours i might bias you with mine
but that's okay this isn't exactly
science
i think he won't invade
i think that we we trapped him
but
there's a persuasion play here that's
really really juicy
i'll tell you about that in a minute so
what do you think
give me your give me your invade or
don't invade and and for our purposes
i'm going to say there's no such thing
as a minor incursion but just forget
about minor or major just invade no
invade invade no invade
so i'm looking at the locals people
mostly no invade
okay so i would say overwhelmingly no
invasion
interesting so that's what i think too
now
um and and you know what's interesting
about this is that it's non-partisan
all bad
i do see some yeses
but it's almost overwhelmingly nose on
both platforms here
all right good um so actually that's
i think i'm kind of happy about that
this result i wasn't sure that people
would be on the same team on this
all right you want to hear the
persuasion play
this is one of the best opportunities
the united states has ever had
and here's the weird part
maybe russia too
like that
you know i've said this before that the
the difference between good news and bad
news
we just can't tell
something that looks like it's on the
edge of a disaster
could just as likely be on the edge of
some great breakthrough that's really
good for everybody
here would be the persuasion play
imagine if you will that putin feels
trapped because he should
if he removes his forces he looks like a
big old and he loses everything he
might have gained
right he has to play the
long game then to try to control ukraine
but he was going to do that anyway
so he can't really withdraw
but he can't really attack
he's absolutely completely trapped
right now of course the wild card is
that is putin and he's a pretty good
chess player so to speak
so he might have some play that
we would never imagine you know just
some completely
surprising thing maybe never know
but here's the persuasion play
because he's trapped
you can make a wild offer that would
ordinarily not be considered
you see that
because he's in a no-win situation
so anything we offer him that looks like
a win
even in an unrelated conversation
he's going to jump at
because the only person the only the
only way that putin can win now at least
in terms of
international prestige the only way he
can win is if we let him
right
he doesn't have a winning play at all
and we have we have all the the cards i
think
and that's what it feels like
so why don't we offer him the following
deal
if you could uh get closer to us let's
say militarily and strategically
and a little bit further from china
whatever that looks like in a secret
deal
we'll figure a way to engineer uh
you know step down in ukraine
that makes it look like you got
something
is a puppet of the biden
machine
you think i'm a puppet of the biden
machine
so somebody's new
i think you're i think you're new here
anyway
um so the only point is this the only
point is this this is a an historically
rare situation
where putin needs a deal
and he probably would be happy to be
more aligned with the u.s
just militarily because it's going to
keep him in office
so
uh as i've mentioned before
every uh
every oligarch who reaches a certain age
when a
let's say when a dictator reaches a
certain age
they're going to be more interested in
let's say what happens to their kids and
their legacy and even themselves when
they're elderly than they are about
conquest
it seems like conquest is a young
dictator's game you know what i mean
40s 50s
once you're in the 60s and 70s you know
conquest isn't such a
fun deal you're more about defense
so i would think that putin is sort of
poised for how can we keep your children
and your children's children alive as
long as possible
and the united states could just say
well
you know we don't care who runs russia
we really don't care if you're if you're
a democracy or a republic or anything
else
now whoever's saying mind reading that's
that's exactly what we're doing so we're
anticipating
but knowing that we can't really read
minds so we're just going through a
mental exercise here so the only thing
i'm trying to communicate is that
you should learn to recognize this
situation
and what this situation is is the very
best time you could offer a
let's say a bold out of the box bigger
than you expected deal which could be a
secret deal
it could be something that
we maybe we just say to russia look
if you never hack us again
we'll never hack you
and we'll we'll let you wind down
because we're more worried about cyber
war than other stuff
right
now i don't know if we could ever you
know make a deal like that hold
so that would require some other experts
to tell me but the point is
yeah the point is you don't get this
kind of a situation
often and if you don't take advantage of
it when's the next time you would be
able to make a really big
progress with russia
all right so uh one interesting thing
here is that uh i guess the
uh pentagon press secretary john kirby
was saying that they think russia is
going to produce some kind of a video
based on some false flag fake event
as a pretext for invasion
now
do you think that's going to happen
do you think that
the russians are in fact planning to
create a
video that makes a fake reason for
invasion
i actually don't believe it
i actually don't believe it now we'll
never know
because the whole point of announcing
that russia might do it is to discourage
them from actually doing it because if
we're primed if we're primed to see it
as fake
then it won't work
so
in terms of what the pentagon did
strategically
strategically this was brilliant
does that would anybody disagree with me
in terms of what
the pentagon decided to do in terms of
announcing
that russia might produce this
propaganda video
isn't it brilliant to tell us in advance
because if we see one now it won't it
won't have the effect the intended
effect
i think this is actually
like one of the smartest things i've
seen
this is damn lunary talk says james
loon retalk
maybe it is
all right
well um
personally i don't think russia was
going to do that but i think that by
you know front running it like this and
priming us it makes it
not really an option anymore so my guess
is that russia might have been talking
about it but i doubt they would have
done it and now i think probably they
can't
so
pretty good but the interesting thing
that came out of it was the
the tough questioning that came from a
reporter from the hill
who was accusing
our government let's say the
spokesperson in this case uh
of just making up stuff like crisis
actors and
alex jones was the analogy that he used
and
um
the government guy was it john kirby it
was john kirby right
did a really terrible job in explaining
why he can't explain
you know where our secret sources are
coming from
oh it wasn't kirby
so i think kirby may have been in
another event
yeah he he said i just told you the
evidence it was really poorly done in
terms of a spokesperson so let me not i
won't blame john kirby if it was who was
it
somebody said ned ryan
anyway we'll look in the comments you'll
find out who us
somebody will have the right name
um but the point is
that if somebody says what is your
evidence for this secret intel
the correct answer is is secret intel
if i could tell you how we got it it
wouldn't be secret intel
and then when the reporter says why
should we believe you just because
you're saying it
what is the right answer
the right answer is not i just told you
which is something like what he did the
right answer is i think you should
remain skeptical of anything you hear
from anybody
that's just a good that's just a good
practice
so you should be skeptical of anything i
say anything anybody says anything
republicans say anything democrats said
just be skeptical of everything but i am
telling you
that our sources are getting this
information
use it use it however you want
but if you do see a propaganda video
being created
just know that we warned you and so you
can put it in that context
i mean it was such an easy thing to
answer
because the the criticism is that the
public shouldn't necessarily believe it
on faith
and he should have just agreed at that
he should have absolutely agreed the
public should not just accept things on
faith
but isn't it helpful to be warned of
things
because if it doesn't happen
what's the difference
right
if there's no false flag what's the
difference
but if there is
then the government becomes more
credible because they warned you
and you're also primed so it doesn't
have the same effect i don't know
so the communication of it was horrible
but the idea of warning us was pretty
good i think
so
biden of course is talking about uh
reducing
access to guns in a variety of ways
and i came up with my own idea for
reducing gun related crime by 75 percent
this is my estimate
75 percent
and
it would be something that both
republicans and democrats
by a pretty strong majority would agree
with
right here's my idea
uh that you would
ban guns gun ownership from just
democrats
because if you ban guns from just
democrats you would reduce crime by
about 75 percent i estimate
you know murder murder by guns
um
and since democrats by a majority are in
favor of gun control
they should certainly be in favor of
gun control on democrats
and since republicans also think that
democrats should have fewer guns
but republicans not necessarily
it seems to me all you'd have to do is
you have a database that says if you
voted democrat and last election or two
you can't have a gun until you've at
least registered republican
what you would be against that
how many of you would oppose this
excellent idea that i'm suggesting
i see a lot of support
i think it's one of the best ideas ever
ever mentioned
um
now here's here's what's funny about it
of course
of course it's not a practical idea but
what would be the practical version of
it
all right so here's here's the practical
well maybe i don't know maybe it's not
practical but let me run it by you
anyway
suppose you said you can't you can't buy
a gun or own a gun unless you've had
nra
or or similarly
accredited
gun training
i mean you would you would end up with
something that almost
looked like what i was joking about
you you'd end up with the responsible
gun owners would get training because
they would say well that's a good idea
anyway
right your basic responsible gun owner
is going to say
you know i have to get training
oh well i was going to do that anyway
now you might make some exceptions for
example
you could say if it's a hunting rifle or
something you don't necessarily have to
go through a gun training course but
it'd be nice
so you know you you could still have
some exceptions
but i think you would get at a lot of
this
even if it only reduced the accidental
access and stuff like that you know even
if it only kept guns away from
the person who was going to grab your
gun and go do something bad
if i were running for
president i would suggest
and i would keep a straight face when i
said we should ban the guns only from
democrats
because
making people talk about that point
would be hilarious
bad means often triumph over good
intentions
that's true eric
um it's an incursion leading down the
slippery slope yeah any anything with
guns
leads to more stuff with guns i think
that's true
um here's an idea that would scare you
in my opinion
artificial intelligence is already smart
enough should we turn it loose to do
this
to identify mass shooters in advance
in my opinion ai is already
already smart enough it would just need
access to enough databases
so if ai had let's say let's say it was
a government ai i'm not suggesting this
i'm just running you through the scary
logic of it so here's the scary logic
i'm positive that if the government
could somehow legally
give the right program
access to just every database in the
world
your financial your credit card your
social media your everything
um your phone
now and i'm hoping that doesn't happen
of course i'm just i'm just scaring you
here
i think ai could identify a mass shooter
in advance what do you think
please stop
you don't have to worry that i'm giving
anybody the idea
because you don't think you don't think
that people who know ai and
yeah i mean it's sort of an obvious idea
so you don't have to worry about
somebody getting the idea for the first
time
and i'm not i'm not suggesting it
because it would be the an outrageous
violation of privacy but how about this
again i'm not suggesting this i'm just
tossing this around
suppose the ai
had access to every database but it was
blinded
meaning that the ai could know
everything but no human could ask the ai
what it learned
now you could ask yourself is that
possible it might not be you know
technically possible to keep humans away
from it but imagine it was
imagine the ai was in some guarded black
box
and all of its knowledge once it went
out and got it
it would bring it back and it would be
in a guarded black box in the middle of
fort knox
so nobody could get to it
so only the ai would know your personal
information
then what would the ai do with it it
would be programmed to do one and only
one thing
warn the people close to you
that there's a potential crisis
not not law enforcement
not law enforcement
but it would warn your family
that a a trigger had been hit
no pun intended
that suggests that somebody is
acquiring the weapons
and has the mindset
that is highly predictive of this crime
and you just get a text message and says
ai has determined that there's somebody
in your family named bob
who is exhibiting behavior that we think
you should look into
no other human in the world would get
the message
except the ones closest to the person
now again i'm not suggesting it
but
is there anybody here who is at least
close enough to ai
to say that that wouldn't work
i mean technically it wouldn't work
socially socially it's a non-starter but
technically i think it would work
wouldn't it
some families wouldn't care that's
another issue yeah
what about the isolated loaners
uh well you know then maybe
you know everybody has a connection to
something even if it's just social media
you can get to anybody
all right here's the uh
here's interesting news how long ago was
it that probably if you read the same
stuff i read you heard that oh yeah we
can have electric cars all right sure
you can make an electric car
but one thing you're never going to make
is an electric airplane am i right am i
right if there's one thing we know for
sure
nobody's ever going to make an electric
airplane because you know blah blah blah
energy to wait
well there's an electric airplane
getting ready to launch
so experts anybody who thought that
wasn't going to happen was wrong
um
but it's a smallish one a nine nine
person commuter thing they think they
can lower maintenance costs by something
like seventy percent
uh it's i think it's an israeli startup
and it's called aviation
now i believe there are a number of
these aren't there
i believe there are a number of startups
in the same space trying to make
electric flight
and am i wrong that the experts said
that was never going to happen
somebody says they already exist in
prototype right they exist in prototype
and there's a little helicoptery one
like the drone
i talked about quantum scape 16 months
ago is that another one of the electric
planes
all right well apparently a lot of
electric planes are coming
all right here's the funniest news of
the day
chuck schumer
uh was trying to support uh biden's
idea of
uh
selecting a
black woman to be nominated for the
supreme court and part of schumer's
argument is that out of the entire
judiciary only six percent of the
judiciary are black women
well that's a pretty good argument isn't
it so it's only six percent
are black women that's clearly a sign of
injustice let me do some math here um
the percentage of black people in the
country a little under 13
so that but that would be all black
citizens of the united states so women
would be roughly uh what
half ish
of something a little under 13 percent
that would be
in the range of what six
oh
six percent is exactly the percentage of
black women in the population
chuck schumer actually said this in
public
[Laughter]
and uh
credit where do uh
twitter account daily daily sunshine
alerted me to this
that's pretty funny
now you may or may not know that there's
a dilbert comic
uh which is based on a real life thing
there was a real boss who said the
following
um that he was concerned about people
calling in sick
because he noticed that 40 of all the
all these sick days
were on either a monday or a friday
so i mean what are the odds
like what are the odds
that 40
of all the sick days are either going to
be like right next to a weekend like on
a friday or a monday what are the odds
of that
okay that is 40 of the work day
or the 40 of the work week is a monday
or friday
so it's exactly what you'd expect
anyway
um do you remember i talked about the
meta analysis
that showed that the lockdowns had no
effect whatsoever
but then i said it was a meta-analysis
and it was so poorly done it was just
obviously garbage
and then i told you that andre's back
house
sort of backed me up on that by picking
it apart
and showing it was garbage
fox news has a big thing today on that
garbage report
uh saying how the other major media are
ignoring it
so here's the fox news headline cnn
msnbc new york times washington post
completely avoid the johns hopkins study
finding coveted lockdowns were
ineffective
there's one reason they might have
completely ignored it
because it was garbage
this is sort of embarrassing
for fox news
you know i appear on fox news so it's
like a little bit embarrassing for me
honestly
honestly it's embarrassing like i don't
mean that
like i don't feel actual shame or
embarrassment the way ordinary people do
but in terms of
i have a professional association with
this with this entity you know because
i've been on it enough times
and i'm thinking to myself i don't like
this at all i don't like this
i i think that they would at least have
to wave their arms at the fact that the
credibility of the thing was questioned
now
and i hate to criticize it because i
want it to be right i mean i want it to
be true none of the lockdowns worked
right so that
that
that fits into my world view but i think
they should at least and
as somebody's saying here just because
andre's back house
picked it apart
it doesn't mean the conclusion is wrong
right
am i right
i'm not saying the conclusion was wrong
i'm just saying that the quality of it
was was low
so you know use your own judgment there
but if you don't mention that the
quality of it was low
uh i think that's the biggest
answer to the mystery of why nobody else
was covering it
because i i don't think at this point
i don't think at this point any of the
major entities would shy away from that
story do you
do you think that as of literally right
today
that one of these entities like new york
times or washington post do you think
that they wouldn't do a story if it were
credible
and the science
and the science is good
i think they would do a story now maybe
before they went to but i think now
i mean look what's happening
in iowa
the disaster protocols will be dropped
on february 15th the governor has
announced
so iowa's uh basically moving anne of
pandemic and into endemic
so yeah i think it's time i think
everybody's going to do a story like
that
eventually all right um
you might be aware that uh china's
gigantic public relations disaster
kicked off today
uh some people call it the olympics some
people call it the omicron olympics
some call it the genocide olympics but i
call it a
public relations
debacle
and
it's a little bit embarrassing also for
nbc news
who apparently has the rights to cover
this thing
and
twitter user election wizard tweeted
this
he said nbc news uh both sides approach
to the ccp's genocide and then it quotes
them saying
nbc news it quotes them as saying uh
western governments uh allege
a
systematic repression of
muslim uighurs allege
that's that's nbc news we allege it
and then quote it has to be said that
the chinese government emphatically
denies all of this they say the
accusations of genocide are the lie of
the century
well i do think that the genocide part
if you mean actual murder
that would be the lie of the century but
i don't think that's exactly what the
first sentence said
the first thing that nbc said was
a systematic repression
but then they do the the both sides
thing and instead of saying is there or
is there not a systematic repression of
uyghurs
which is the claim
they give a defense of genocide
which was not the
claim so if you're not paying attention
it looks like it looks like there was a
claim and then they addressed it and
said it was false but actually there was
a claim and then somebody addressed
something completely different
the claim actually stands
they didn't even
deny or at least
not in a direct denial to this claim
anyway
uh systematic repression
so maybe it would be smarter to say that
china is involved in systematic
repression and let them respond to that
because every time you say genocide
you're giving them an easy out well
where are the bodies
you know
now i'm only saying that as far as i
know
it's not systematic murder
like i don't believe that's been
reported
i believe it's systematic um
repression which
which would include reproduction
so i you know you could argue that
reproduction
that reproduction repression
would be genocide
ish
but
it's not
a cultural genocide yeah you could say
cultural genocide that you're just using
it that way
have you ever imagined what it would
feel like
if you were uh pelted with pocket lint
and let's say it was the pocket lint
that came out of your grandfather's suit
that had been in the the attic in
storage for over 40 years
and you went up there and you rifled
through the pockets and here's a little
bit a little pocket limp and somebody
like threw it at you
like
what would it feel like
if that happened
not just once
but it seemed like every single time you
checked the news
there was another piece of pocket lint
from your grandfather's old suit
hitting you
it would be like waterboarding wouldn't
it i mean it would be terrible
and that is what i feel
is how spotify and joe rogan must feel
because today even barbara streisand has
threatened to remove her music from
spotify
if they don't de-platform joe rogan
immediately
and i'm thinking to myself
my god the slow trickle
of being bombarded by
pocket len from your grandfather's suit
that was in the attic for 40 years
uh the walls are closing in
uh at this point we don't know the exact
dollar amounts but um experts are
estimating the spotify because of all
these boycotts of joe rogan
they may have already lost up to a
thousand dollars
already
at least
multiple hundreds of dollars of loss
and uh despite that
spotify is standing strong behind their
talent uh joe rogan so you have to give
spotify some credit they that's uh
that's a hit
hundreds possibly even as much as a
thousand dollars they've lost
and uh they're just going to push right
ahead
i say
they deserve our respect
mike cernovich had a uh interesting
observation in a tweet
um
says for the first time in his life
because for the first time in my life
uh no one believes the regime when they
claim to have
taken down a terrorist
he says friends i can't overstate how
this is truly unprecedented
so the whole story about the isis leader
being killed
how many people just thought to
themselves
oh oh did we
somebody got killed in a remote place
that we can't
we can't easily verify
and it just happened to be when biden's
popularity numbers were
kind of low
kind of low and if there's one thing
that you can guarantee will get people
on your side from both republicans and
democrats
it's to take on a terrorist leader
it's like the best thing you could
possibly do and he did it at the best
possible time
i was joking yesterday that he must have
a checklist
and they just look at his approvals it's
like uh
prove a level down to oh god 43 oh god
oh god
get the terrorist checklist
uh head of uh we did al qaeda okay what
what's left we got uh solomony okay okay
okay isis is it isis have we hit isis
we'll do isis i think we could get those
numbers up five percent
now
i'm not saying anything like that
happened
i am saying that i agree with mike
cernovich's comment
that our level of skepticism
is approaching practical levels
that's right
all right the level of skepticism that
the public is now willing to somewhat
automatically apply to everything
it's approaching
useful
almost
it's almost good enough
to keep us out of the wood chipper not
not quite there
we're still a little bit
too
believing
we're still a little bit too gullible
especially
if something comes from our own team
yeah we'll believe anything from our own
team that's the problem
but
i feel like our
our distrust of the government is
finally
finally reaching healthy levels
maybe we could do something about
getting an election system
that is fully credible because it's
fully transparent
instead of a little bit transparent and
then we act like that was the whole
thing
maybe maybe
we can start having wars that make sense
if any war makes sense and just avoiding
all the ones that were
maybe
maybe
maybe
we can stop believing all the experts
who have been wrong about everything
every time
which of course is an exaggeration
to be fair
the experts obviously help a lot
civilization requires them but the
trouble is we can't tell which ones are
right
this is the same problem with investing
if i said hey go buy some stocks
and you would say well i don't know
anything about stocks or investing how
am i going to buy the right ones
and i'd say well just do your best use
your judgment
you just go off and buy some stocks how
would that do
well if you bought one stock
your odds would not be good
so instead what do you do well you get
an expert to help you
how many experts are there so there are
10 000 stocks roughly
that's how many you could buy in the
united states
how many experts are there
way more than ten thousand right
so instead of guessing one in ten
thousand and hoping that you you get
like
a good stock
in order to improve your odds you've
decided to pick one out of a hundred
thousand
experts
who would then be guessing
on what stocks to buy
if they bought stocks for you now some
of them might put you in a managed fund
so they charge you a fee to put you in a
in a fund that charges you a fee
not so good so my point is it doesn't
matter how much the experts know
if you don't know
how to know which experts are right
right
the problem is not what the experts know
the problem isn't with what you know
and it doesn't help me if experts know
everything because i don't know which
one is right
so
um once you realize that
then then i think you've you reached a
new level there
all right
uh somebody said i've made a small
fortune from investing in apple
apple is a weird exception
because they're effectively a monopoly
once you get in the apple ecosystem you
just can't get out
most if you found that out i mean you
can it's just a huge pain in the ass
so
there aren't too many things like apple
that's sort of a once in a generation
sort of thing yeah microsoft was that
for a long time and arguably still is i
think amazon probably is that
but there are very few things in that
category now keep in mind that if if
apple had not succeeded
i would be here telling you well it was
obviously didn't succeed so i
i guess i have to
review my own skepticism here
because you really
i also made a i also made a killing on
apple i've held it for a long time now
but i don't think i was a genius
i think i got lucky that's the way i
process it
did we all already talk about scott said
the these uh things you see
those are just
dermatologist with a spray
that freezing stuff these are just
little uh cosmetic changes
so
literally there was just a little
cosmetic thing here that i had frozen so
for a while it'll look worse and then
a month from now it'll be gone
did i sell any ethereum um i only
i only transferred some ethereum into
bitcoin
at just about the worst time
but not much of it so i haven't i
haven't
sold any beyond
just transferring it to another crypto
uh
you bought bitcoin or gbtc based on you
owning it
uh well
you shouldn't take financial advice from
me
however i would say that
whatever your reasons for holding um
bitcoin originally
i don't think it's changed
i don't think it's changed
because i don't think the reason was
that you could see what was coming
i think the reason was that you couldn't
see what was coming
so that it was a it was part of a
diverse portfolio
that sometimes other things will go down
and that will go up and vice versa
um
government interference there
the risk of government interference has
always been there hasn't it
but also the risk that somebody would
find a let's say a security hole in it
always there
as again more or less
i don't know
bitcoin is a passing off fraud going
through the courts my friend going
through the courts i don't know what
that means
any canadian truckers predictions
well everything that draws the public's
attention
toward putting pressure on governments
to end the mandates is good
so anything that can stay in the news is
what the politicians will care about and
as the politicians see hey this public
these truckers have a lot of support
then they're more likely to end the
mandate sooner so the more the more
support you show for the truckers
the more you're helping yourself if you
want to end mandates but you know one of
the things that is easy to forget
is how many people don't want to end
mandates like the citizens
and i hardly ever see them unless i see
them in the comments on twitter
because i don't know anybody in person
do you
i i literally don't know anybody in
person who doesn't want all the mandates
to end
not in person
but there's plenty of them obviously
there are plenty of them
yeah some of you know them and they
they're in the comments so
and here's
here's another uh thing that i thought
of yesterday
you know how i was talking about how the
teenagers seem to be not rebellious
enough about masks
i have a really weird hypothesis
that teenagers like covering their faces
at school
that that the mask is uncomfortable
but i believe that teenagers like
covering their faces
because one of the biggest problems in
high school is people making fun of
people for their looks
and i think anybody who's got like some
acne for example
how many teenagers have at least some
acne where the mask would cover it up
i i actually think that anybody who even
has one pimple
is glad to have a mask if they're 16 or
15 or 14.
so
um the the the really conspicuous lack
of pushback by teenagers
is telling me that this might be like
hoodies
have you ever seen how often the the
teams will wear the hoodies and they'll
wear it so it's almost completely
covering the face
and if you look at women who have you
know their hair down how often do you
see women just using their hair as like
a
shield for their face
men grow beards beards are in right now
it's basically a face covering
so
i you have to throw this in the mix i
think that teenagers actually got used
to masks
and they're finding a benefit in them
that was completely non-obvious which is
they like to cover their faces
i i think that's actually happening
because otherwise can you think of
anything else you could make teenagers
do that they wouldn't push back harder
think about it
name anything else you could do that
would be this intrusive
that they wouldn't push back harder on
if it feels like they not only got used
to it but maybe found some benefits we
did not anticipate because
you know the younger ones might be
carl says damn you i think you're right
i think i'm right too
i think i'm right too i don't think they
would necessarily say it
if you ask them might not be aware of it
but and here's here's what uh keyed me
to it
there have been a number of situations
in which i was glad to have a mask on
has anybody had that
experience yet
have you had even one situation let's
say an odd unusual situation
whatever it was
yeah i'll see in the comments a lot of
people say yes
at least for some like limited no i'm
not saying that you enjoy the masks i'm
saying that there might have been at
least one time
when you were happy to have it on
i'll give you an
example do you ever do you ever have uh
you're gonna talk to somebody and you
maybe you ate something you're you're
not sure about your breath
has anybody thought to themselves oh i'm
glad i can just put this mask on because
i'm worried about my breath
well that how about you has anybody had
a anything going on with their face
like uh
you know their
lips are chapped or there's a pimple
they forgot to shave or they don't have
makeup on or
forgot their lipstick
yeah i feel like i feel like there are
50 reasons now i have one that's unique
to me
which is
now that i'm more recognized in public
i actually
i hate to say it
i'm i'm
obviously very anti-mask
mass mandate
but there have been times when i felt
more comfortable with the mask on in
public
now that's unique to me because
of recognizability there have also been
times
when i was so cold
that i it was conspicuously warmer with
a mask on when i was just say walking to
my car that i would leave the mask on to
walk to the car because it was warmer
you know it's amazing what you can get
used to
yeah i mean i haven't worn a mask
in a few days more than you know
actually i wore a mask in the doctor's
office
because it's a doctor's office
you know
part of my rebellion
is that
i try to be sensitive to who is the
person on the other side of the
rebellion and i'm not going to rebel in
a doctor's office
you get that right it has nothing to do
with my belief about my risk
is simply a respect for the office
does that make sense
if the doctor is wearing a mask
and i know the doctor would prefer it
that's one setting in which it has
nothing to do with the mask it's more
about just respect for the professional
that's all
so and i would and if you wanted to be a
rebel about that that's your business
i'm just saying it's a personal respect
thing
and it only lasts you know 10 minutes
so it's not going to make or break
whether masks are mandated
but the the place that doesn't make
sense is target you know your gym
that sort of thing
now i'm not saying you need them
nothing about science
yeah all right that's all for now
um i believe
it was sort of a slow news day tomorrow
it's going to be better
and
why don't you have a good weekend
okay
all right have a good weekend
