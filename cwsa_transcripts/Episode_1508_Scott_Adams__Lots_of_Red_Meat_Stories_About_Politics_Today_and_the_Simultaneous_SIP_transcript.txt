good morning everybody and welcome to
probably the best thing you'll ever
experience it's called coffee with scott
adams and
i know some of you are new to this and
you're saying to yourself this doesn't
look so good
what's the big deal about this but you
haven't had the simultaneous sip
right
if you've experienced a simultaneous sip
you know
the pure joy
of feeling everybody in the world
who's watching this at the same time
enjoying the same simultaneous sip and
you're gonna enjoy it too all you need
is a cup or a mug or a glass a tanker
chelsea steiner canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and this is what makes you addicted it's
going to happen now go
john says it's his first day of sipping
but he's been listening for months
oh
there are others like you aren't there
there are other people watching who are
thinking to themselves i'm not going to
do the sip
okay i'll watch the content
but i'm not going to do the simultaneous
sip don't manipulate me hypnotist
not gonna do it
oh you'll do it
oh you will do it
you just don't know it yet
because you'll want to
i don't have to talk you into it you're
going to want it
you're going to want it
so good
i feel sorry for the people who aren't
doing this
i think i'll take another one
don't
yeah don't do it don't be manipulated
into it no matter how good it is
no matter how much you would enjoy it
do not let me manipulate you into taking
a sip of a delicious beverage
just because i want you to
that's no reason
oh
my god it goes down just as good as it
goes past the taste buds
but don't do this
you do you
enjoy it
you know everybody's different
one more
wow
yeah but you do you
all right let's get to the news
rasmussen tells us
just what i expected do you know what
kind of polls i like
the kind of polls i like
are the ones that agree with me
those are the good ones
the ones that don't agree with the i
call those bogus but the ones that agree
with me pretty pretty accurate well
rasmussen has a poll that says
if trump ran against biden today
do you know how he'd do
well according to registered likely
voters
51
would vote for trump
and only 41 percent would vote for biden
now
who told you
who told you that
trump would get more popular after he
left office
i did
and it's happening because you're gonna
you're gonna forget all the individual
outrages because there were so many of
them they'll just sort of lump together
but you're gonna remember what he did
you're gonna remember the border was
better the
economy was good
china was you know being pushed back
you're gonna remember all that
now i worry about a poll
where people have just two choices here
because i think
you know i think people probably would
just vote their party line in the end
but suppose trump ran against harris
according to rasmussen
52 would say trump
39 would say harris
so the two strongest
democrats in the world
in the country let's say
would both lose to trump if they had an
election today
so
um i would say my my prediction that
trump would grow in popularity once out
of office
it's kind of looking good
it's kind of looking good i think
there's another level after this
i think the level after this is where
we've really forgotten you know all the
all the acrimony and you know the mean
tweets and stuff i think that the
distant historians are going to be the
kindest to trump
because his his accomplishments will
last and his
outrages will seem unimportant
all right
glenn greenwald
continues to be one of the best follows
on twitter and one of the most
interesting public characters i would
say so if you're not following glenn
greenwald you're really missing a good
show
i mean his twitter feed is
like i would pay for it
you know it's almost subscription
quality compared to other other
tweets
but uh he says today
that uh in a tweet huge numbers of
corporate media outlets spent weeks
peddling an outright
lie from the cia
that the biden emails were quote russian
disinformation do you remember that
do you remember when uh
all the talking heads were saying oh
those those emails
that's probably russian disinformation
so glenn says that was the cia
gaslighting the country and
and as uh greenwald says and now we'll
ignore the fact that one of their own
a political reporter just published a
book
definitively debunking their lives
so politico i don't know who it is but
some political reporter has a book i
guess
and greenwald goes on he says these are
the same people who spread the cia lie
that russians put bounties on the heads
of u.s soldiers and trump did nothing
about it
same people who spread the now debunked
trump alpha bank lie that was the idea
that there was some kind of private
server that trump had that was connected
to some bank which somehow i didn't even
uh
i didn't even see that story when it
happened originally
now
what do you think do you believe
is it true or false i want to say to
your comments true or false
do you believe
that the cia
planted all three of these stories
and he doesn't even mention russia and
collusion
uh you know the trump collusion story
doesn't even mention that one
was that
cia
so in the comments how many of you
believe it
i'm seeing only yeses
i see one now on locals i see it maybe
um well it looks like youtube is uh very
much believing it and locals do
looking at both platforms your comments
yeah you do believe it don't you
so
here you are in a country in which your
most important
industry to protect your freedom
which is the press
you believe doesn't exist
you okay with that
are you okay with that
yeah you can throw in the fbi i guess is
part of this
how are we okay with the fact
that the cia
is making up stories
and the corporate press is just printing
them
like it's real
could that be a more dangerous situation
have we already lost everything
but it's weird that because when you say
the cia did something
is it always the same people
is it is it the head of the cia who
makes these decisions or is it just
people associated with you know into
people making up their own
projects you know how is this happen
well
it feels real to me
to me it feels real that the news is not
real
and that at least the political parts a
lot of it are just literally just made
up
by the sea our own cia
now can i prove it nah
i don't have any proof
but you've seen yeah you've seen clapper
and brennan uh on tv lying
lying to the public you've seen that so
i don't think you trust these
entities whatsoever
now here's a question for you
the media
i would say the media has two major
forms at this point
what are the forums
uh is you know the regular
legacy media the fox news and the cnns
and stuff but the other part of the
media is
people like me
pundits
if you believe that all of the major
media legacy platforms have been let's
say captured by the cia
if you believe that's the case
what about the independent voices
what about the people that you follow on
twitter who have you know gigantic
followings
and seem to be independent voices
has the cia also captured them
what do you think
has the cia captured the independent
political voices the people with just
social media followings
yeah
yeah you're a little worried now aren't
you
a little bit worried now
now let me ask you this
do you think i know the answer to that
question definitively
so here's your new question i'll wait
i'll wait for you to be done answering
this because there's lag here
do you think that i know the answer to
the question
of whether the cia is also
co-opting
individual voices who are not part of
legacy news
because i would be one of those people
right so if they had never contacted me
well let me ask you this do you think
any intelligence agencies have tried to
co-opt me
and your comments have any intelligence
agencies us or other
tried to co-opt me
on politics
yeah of course
yes
the answer is yes
have they succeeded
have they succeeded
in
co-opting me
i'm looking at your answers you say no
no no
no
well you're wrong
hate to tell you
they've co-opted me
now when i say they've co-opted me that
doesn't mean that i'm you know saying
anything that i wouldn't normally say
but
one of the things that is the subtle way
that people like me get influenced
is by what stories we see
and which ones are brought to our
attention so when i talk about the news
i talk about the things that have come
to my attention how does stuff come to
my attention
what do you think is my process
for deciding what stories to focus on
no scott did not just admit to being a
sellout listen to the rest of the
 story
right
i'm i'm open to hearing your uh your
opinions after you've heard it
but maybe maybe wait till after after
you've heard it and then make your
decision okay
all right
so here's how people like me
decide what the news we're going to talk
about is
often people send me stuff
people you know you can see it yourself
you can watch it in real time you see
people tweet things at me
and then i say oh that's interesting and
then i talk about it
do you think
that anybody is tweeting at me
things they would like me to spend more
time on
who may or may not be associated with
intelligence agencies
so that's the model how many think that
that's happening
that there are people associated with
maybe not on the payroll i'm not talking
people i'm not talking actual spies
i'm talking people associated with
because you know intelligence agencies
don't work with just people they pay
they they have an extended family of you
know connections that do things for them
so
i would say
that i'm not necessarily aware of who
works for who
well i can say that for sure i am not
necessarily aware of who works for who i
have some ideas
i have some ideas if somebody sends me a
story that seems to be pro-israel
do i say to myself oh
i wonder who this person is
and i wonder if they have any
connections with you know israel
intelligence or or the government
and i often assume they do
but
if the story is what i like
and it's been brought to my attention
yeah i'll talk about it because it's
something i like and it's in my
wheelhouse and it's what i would have
talked about anyway and i know about it
so i talk about it
so it works
the the way that somebody like me can be
influenced is just by what stories i
talk about
so i believe that um some number of
stories that get sent to me through a
variety of channels you know usually
individuals who say hey i think you'd be
interested in this
some number of them are
intelligence agency connected
now some of them i know
meaning i know they're connected and
some of them i assume they're connected
so i use that filter when i see stuff
so you know
there's no time when i don't say to
myself
why did somebody give this to me right
so at the very least i'm aware of it
and i try to do what i can to you know
monitor my own bias but can i succeed at
that i don't think so i don't think you
can completely succeed at that i'm not
i'm not talking about any one person
yeah there's a universe of you know
maybe
20 to 50 people who might send me things
on any given topic and i just assume
that there they have some connections or
uh
or some
say affinity for
different countries
all right um
are there any major media outlets that
are captured by our cia
what do you think
are there any major media companies
that are not captured by the cia
do you think
and what would it be somebody says cnn
okay that i hope that's a joke right
because
cnn would not be on the top of my list
of non-captured entities
yeah you know i don't know i don't know
the answer to that because it's it's
always a matter of degree right
it's not so much that
you know some something is completely
captured and something is not i think
it's all a matter of degree
yeah and i would say that the
independent political voices such as
myself
i think we're trying to be independent
for the most part i mean i speak for
myself
but we have to be influenced i mean
you can't turn off influence
if somebody tries to influence you
they're and they're good at it
it's probably gonna work
my friends with bob dole that is the
weirdest question in the world i've
never met bob dole
but how weird
all right black lives matter blm is
threatening an uprising against
what they call the racist vaccine
mandates
did you see that coming the racist
vaccine mandates
because i guess since
the black population has low vaccination
rates
it would be
bigger burden on them if vaccination
mandates are required
blm might actually go to the streets
about that
but here's the
here's the weird thing
um
can black lives matter agree with the
republicans this aggressively
and what happens if they do
what would happen if just i'm just going
to put this out here
this could actually happen
imagine a black lives
matter rally against vaccine mandates so
just imagine that happens
and then imagine that conservatives
say we're in
we're in
and there are just as many conservatives
that show up clearly conservatives like
you could just look at them and go okay
that's
probably a trump supporter there
and watch them uh march at the same time
with black lives matter because they
have a shared
a shared idea on this one topic could
that happen
could it
why wouldn't it happen what would stop
it from happening
would anything stop it from happening
in fact i would say that the main reason
that black lives matter will not
go to the streets
is that republicans will join them
right
it's the main reason
i don't think it's going to happen
because the black lives matter their
whole uh
the whole deal kind of falls apart
if they go to the street
and 5 000 uh conservatives join them
and just say we're with you
boom we're with you that's it
no arguments
no fighting
we're with you
now
i'm not sure this is the fight that i
would recommend anybody be in that's a
separate topic
but it could be could be could be
strange bedfellows
and i would tell you that the next thing
that black lives matter and
conservatives
might agree on is school choice
and the problems with the teachers
unions
again there's pretty much complete
agreement
that we need more school choice it's a
conservative thing and it's
it's a
it's a black interest thing
right both would benefit
maybe in different ways but both would
benefit from that kind of a
change to society
i could see them i could see them get
getting together twice
and the way to do it is to just say that
reparations means fixing schools
it's the best you can do i mean some
people would like reparations to be some
kind of cash payment but since that's
never going to happen
i don't think
why don't you do what you can do
what you can do is fix the biggest
source of systemic racism
which is the teachers unions and the
republicans would be all over that
so black lives matter and republicans
maybe haven't figured it out yet but
they're on the same side on the biggest
issue which you could call reparations
you could call a systemic racism
that's what you know black lives matters
would call it but the republicans would
call it
where is my freedom
why can't i go to a school i want to go
to or take my kids to
an optional better
school
so they'd have different reasons for why
they want school choice but both of them
would be getting a better school
right i mean i guess it's the same
reason in the end better school but you
would describe it differently in terms
of why you want better schools
i don't know we might be
i've been predicting for some time that
there would be a strange coming together
of black lives matter and conservatives
that
it was almost inevitable
i feel like i feel like it's inevitable
that
the black population in this country is
going to start courting conservatives
partly because they agree on so much
you've got a
at the very least there's a religious
connection right
you know highly religious black
population pretty religious
republicans very religious
there's a lot they could come together
on
and i feel like it's going to happen
because it's you know as soon as black
lives matter realizes that republicans
are not against them
or let's say not against black people
but rather
pro-freedom
and pro-competition and all those things
i think i think
they can figure it out they can get
together so i'm going to keep that that
will be my most counter-intuitive
prediction of all time although i got a
few good ones lately
i'm going to say that black lives matter
will explicitly
so i'm going to i'm going to put this in
the form of a prediction
black lives matter
will explicitly
join forces with republicans on at least
one topic
maybe more because if the first one
works you would do more
but but there'll be at least one topic
where they i'll go even further i'm
going to make it physical
here's my prediction
black lives matter and conservatives
will march together in the street
within two years
that's my prediction within two years
republicans and black lives matter will
march march together on some topic
within two years all
right um the debate over nuclear energy
has officially ended
does that even sound possible
the debate over nuclear energy
it just ended
so uh jennifer uh
granholm who's the secretary of uh
energy right
um she just gave a big speech and made
it as clear as you could possibly make
it climate change is an emergency this
is her framing
and
you can't handle it without nuclear
and that nuclear energy is now
safer
and the new technologies are safe
compared to other things
and and you don't need fusion for this
fusion would be great but it's not
necessary in this model
now
here's the weird part of the story
don't know if you remember how much i
was trying to get the trump
administration to say as strongly as
jennifer grenholm did that nuclear power
has to be in the future it has to be a
big part of the future
and
the the trump administration was always
pro-nuclear
and they did a lot of pro-nuclear things
in terms of setting up
test sites for nuclear technologies et
cetera
so they acted
right the trump administration but they
didn't really make a big deal about it
trump himself
hardly ever mentioned it and certainly
never made a big point of it it was
usually just sort of mentioned in a list
but
imagine if you will
that trump had been pro-nuclear like
a big deal as much as he was
um build the wall
imagine if trump had been nuclear
nuclear nuclear you got to build some
nuclear
that would have made it impossible for
democrats to do it
wouldn't it it would be like the wall
the democrats can't accept a wall even
though they want one
because it was trump's wall am i right
don't you think there are a lot of
democrats who'd kind of like to have a
wall now
not so much that they stop everybody
from coming in
but at least we have the option
of you know regulating it the way we
want to regulate it not the way some
entity wants to regulate it
so i feel as if
we got to this uh complete agreement and
i'm going to say complete agreement
meaning that democrats and republicans
are both
strongly pro-nuclear now at least at the
higher levels
so i'll call that the agreement there's
obviously citizens will take a while to
catch up
but
um
this is amazing and i don't think it
would have happened if trump had been
way way way more pro-nuclear i think
the only way this could happen is that
trump was kind of quiet about it
right because it's not that it's not
that polarized and it could have been
um
so here's my question to you
how did this happen
what happened
what happened in the last
say five years
that made nuclear energy go from a
highly polarizing topic
to
complete agreement what happened
what do you think happened
um i'm just looking at your
schellenberger right
i think that's what happened
i think michael schellenberger
is a big part of the story but we'll
never know how much so let me let me
complete the pieces here
so many of you know that mark schneider
was a big advocate of
nuclear worked in the industry still
works in the industry i think and
um
and he taught me everything i know and i
i would talk
continuously about
nuclear being needing to be a bigger
deal
now also michael sheldenberger who's
written books on the topic and included
you know it's in books on the topic
and he's testified to congress twice i
think
at least twice
and if you haven't heard the the michael
schellenberger presentations on all this
green energy stuff and nuclear you
really have to
because he's got the whole package right
he's got the whole persuasion package
and
i think he sold it to congress
i mean they called him in for that
purpose to find out
you know
find out what's what
now i see you mentioning bjorn lomborg
and he would be the other you know
biggest name that i can think of
in the same category but i don't know if
he testified did he ever testify to
congress
because he's not american
i don't know if he did
i doubt it i don't i think i would have
remembered hearing it
anyway um
so i'm gonna say congratulations to the
people who put in the time
um i feel like i tried to help as much
as possible
i don't know if i did
but tried
and
um it looks like it happened
i mean was there any five years ago if i
said to you if i said to you five years
ago i think we'll have a complete
agreement on this nuclear energy thing
would you believe that
i mean it seemed like if something was
just going to be a permanent division
now like i said the public still hasn't
caught up but the fact that both
republicans and democrats are
pro-nuclear now
that's the end of the debate because the
public will catch up
yeah somebody says honestly it wasn't
even on your radar yeah that's true all
right uh fox news uh and i'm gonna give
them credit for this i don't know if
they came up with it but do you remember
when uh kids in cages was the big story
that kids in cages story was really
powerful wasn't it
because it wasn't just oh immigration is
going to be really bad for a lot of
people
that doesn't feel it's not visual
doesn't hit you in the in the fields
but then you say
we're putting kids in cages
now was that true
well you know sort of
they were fenced in areas
um calling them cages makes it ten times
worse how it sounds
so yeah it was true-ish
ish you know you you could make the
argument but it was so visual meaning
that you would not only see the pictures
of it some of the pictures were fake but
you still remember them
but you'd have a in your mind a perfect
picture of it so that's what made it so
devastatingly uh effective
and now fox news and and the right has
come up with their response to kids in
cages
it's called haitians under a bridge
haitians under a bridge do you know how
much the under the bridge part adds to
the story
a lot
same as the cages
it's not just kids and it's not just
haitians it's kids in cages
and it's haitians under a bridge
because as soon as you add the under a
bridge
the movie is complete right
you don't need all the details you just
see a massive humanity under a bridge
and you can see it
it's it's the so here's your persuasion
lesson for the day
adding the under a bridge
really sells this story
just like adding in cages sold the story
before
so once you see a play that works for
once one team
you can pretty much depend on the other
team giving that technique a try
and and here it's happening and it's
working
it looks like it's
you know it captures our imagination in
a very similar way i mean kids is
obviously
uh you know the ultimate if you could do
something about a story where kids are
being injured
that's your ultimate persuasion
but
haitians have something going for them
too don't they
what the haitians have going for them is
that they're black
and in this country if there's a story
about a massive uh group of black people
being mistreated that's a damn big story
right because you got
you know kids in cages
haitians
you know black people under being forced
to live under bridges horrible
conditions it does add that extra spice
to the story
and not in a good way but it does
so anyway good uh good persuasion play
from the right whoever came up with that
uh i tweeted a
story for you to debunk there's some
claim
i'm not i won't even tell you who it is
but there there's a tweet and a tweet
thread
claiming that india beat the delta
variant when they uh
introduced ivermectin and there's it
comes complete with graphs that i don't
believe etc so i asked my skeptics to
debunk that
i think it'll be debunked by the time
we're done here i haven't checked the
comments yet but
it looked really persuasive
if you had only seen the claim
you absolutely would be convinced if
you've never seen any pushback on it it
looks very convincing there's a graph
and it shows that the time that
ivermectin was put into place and then
the graph falls and then you compare it
to the united states and the you know
other countries and we're just going up
but allegedly i don't know if any of
this is true
but allegedly india went up and then
ivermectin and it went way down
did that really happen
because it's a it's an outrageously
specific claim
with stuff that could all be checked
publicly
now i don't have the time to check it
that's why i was asking other people to
look at it
but
somebody says curry i don't think so
um
anyway so i'll just put that out there
that i don't think there's anything true
to that story
but i'd love to be wrong that would be
fun
what did uh
oh ivormectin sounds good until you
listen to the z dog yeah
um
all right so i'm going to call that b
that story bs that india beat the delta
with ivermectin i don't think that's
true but i'll let the skeptics tear that
apart
um the new story about hunter biden i
guess business insider has this breaking
news
uh allegedly hunter biden asked there's
some new emails
of hunter biden that have been
discovered
not from the laptop
so they're hunter biden emails allegedly
but not from the laptop
so you have to wonder if they're real
that's the first question
all right
apparently uh hunter biden asked for a
retainer of two billion dollars per year
plus a success fee
because two million a year not enough
you also need a success fee to help
unfreeze money belonging to the libyan
government
this was in 2015 while his father was
still vice president
what
what
am i really really is this real and now
it's breaking news so like most news you
should say to yourself maybe it's not
real
you know it could be a fake email that
somebody got or something
but what if this is real
if this is real how is hunter biden
going to unfreeze libyan money
with all of his
libyan unfreezing money connections that
he personally had not through his father
who was vice president of the united
states there's no conceivable way
that he could have gotten this job done
without his father
is there
or dealing with people who want to make
his father happy but it's the same thing
so
here's what's going to happen
i feel like
nothing
i feel like this story will come out
we will believe it is true
and nothing will happen
right doesn't it feel like nothing's
going to happen
because this is clearly a crime
isn't it or if it's not a crime
it's something terrible
uh now apparently the the project didn't
go forward so maybe that gives them an
out because it didn't happen it was just
an offer
but
oh my god
oh my god
if this is true
oh my god
i mean it's as bad as the other stuff
we've already heard but it's additive to
that
rico interesting
i'm seeing in the comments uh there
could be a ricoh case i don't know could
there i don't know anything about that
stuff
so
but
but to the point that it would be an
organized conspiracy
i know i wouldn't rule it out
all right uh tucker carlson being uh
provocative
being provocative again
i'm gonna tell you what he said and then
i'll give you my comments on it
um so he quoted joe biden in uh
22
in 2015 i guess or so made this comments
so joe biden said somewhere
quote an unrelenting stream of
immigration nonstop non-stop
folks like me who are caucasian of
european descent for the first time in
2017 will be an absolute minority in the
united states of america absolute
minority
fewer than 50 percent of the people in
america from then on will be white
european stock
that's not a bad thing
that's a source of our strength
all right so the key words here are that
biden says
that having lots of immigration and
making the united states not majority
white european
is quote not a bad thing
and quote a source of our strength
so to that
tucker says he goes that's the reason
to reduce the political power of people
so this is tucker's commentary
that biden has admitted
that it's to reduce the political power
of people whose ancestors lived here
and dramatically increased the
proportion of americans newly arrived
from the third world
and then tucker said that biden went
further and said that non-white dna is a
source of our strength
did that happen
did biden say that non-white dna is the
source of our strength
did you hear that in the quote
right so that's that's tucker's summary
that biden said that non-white dna is
the source of our strength
let me read his exact quote again biden
said
that we'll be no longer a majority white
european
and he said that's not a bad thing
that's the source of our strength
all right so i'm seeing in the comments
most people say yeah you said it right
there
there's the quote there's tucker's
interpretation that interpretation is
correct
right
i'm saying only yeses to that
it's right here
so tucker's interpretation is accurate
right because i read you the quote i
read you the interpretation and you're
saying yeah that's it oh wait now i'm
seeing some nose
where did all the nose come from all of
a sudden
did you think i was tricking you
now it's all nose i'm seeing in the
comments
nope
no biden did not say what tucker says he
says
uh my interpretation of what biden said
when he when he said that's not a bad
thing that's the source of our strength
who's us who's our who's our strength
the united states right
so can you say that um
moving from a majority white european
stock to a more diverse
mix would be the argument that that
makes us stronger
so tucker's interpretation seems to be
that it brings in better dna
the brown people have better dna than
the white people who are already there
i will think that's what that's saying
i don't think that's what biden's saying
to me it looks like biden is saying that
what makes the united states great
is that we're diverse
now do you think that diversity has ever
helped the united states
well
it certainly helped when we got those
german scientists after world war ii
i don't know if you want to call that
diverse
but
i don't know how many other nazis or
nazi
you know sympathizers or workers or
anything well i wouldn't call them
sympathizers but i don't know how many
people from the nazi regime we brought
to the united states but it helped
didn't it there's a little diversity
that helped
that's a weird example i know
but
do you buy the argument
that diversity is an advantage
see that's the area
tucker took it in a different direction
with dna i don't think that was ever the
intention i think it was just diversity
diversity
well
i'm i'm going to give you the counter
argument i'm seeing lots of people say
no
here's
here's the frame i'd put on it what is
it about the united states
that made it work
right well a lot of things we had lots
of natural resources and stuff like that
we didn't have a world war ii on our on
our
shores so there were lots of things that
made the united states work and some of
it was luck
but
i would argue that the biggest thing
that makes it work
is how people got here
meaning that the people who said
to heck with this country i'm in i'm
going to go make something happen
somewhere else
don't you think that that is a really
selective group
suppose you suppose you started with the
population of the world
you said all right i'm just going to put
all the people who have the the
following qualities
in one country
those will be the people who couldn't
stand the country they were in
because it wasn't free enough
didn't give them enough options
and they were going to take a tremendous
risk to get out of there and improve
their life
right so that's the group that you
filtered people who will take a big risk
succeed because they don't get to this
country unless they succeed
succeed as something really really hard
because the long-term advantage will be
good
how many of those do you want in your
country
how many people with that quality
we're not talking about where they came
from any culture
doesn't matter the culture
wherever they came from
they took a gigantic risk to get here
pulled it off
made it work
and they were planning for the distant
future they weren't planning for what
was happening today
they were planning years in advance so
their mindset was years in advance
hard work
risk
and freedom
and we got all of them
well we didn't get all of them but but
that's basically what makes up the
united states
right
now i would argue
that any time that yeah brave brave
right risk takers
i would argue that anytime you take the
best of every culture
those are the best
right
in my opinion
the people who can make that work and
are thinking so far in advance
that they're thinking generations in
advance literally they're thinking their
children and grandchildren that's why
they come here
i would think that if you took those
people out of every country and put them
in one country
that country would rule the world
every time
so
in order for that to work
picking i'm gonna say they're the best
people from each culture
if you take the best people from each
culture the ones who have that quality
about them
that doesn't make you stronger
remember all the no's you had and
everybody said no no no there's no way
diversity makes us stronger
but i just gave you an argument
where where we got the best
of all the diverse cultures because
they're the only ones who could get here
the ones who weren't the best couldn't
get here
they didn't they they were just going to
take care of what was happening right in
front of them they were not long-term
planners they weren't willing to take a
risk they couldn't figure it out
well that's the argument
so
they only want free stuff
um i i think
i think there's certainly a number of
people who are not
you know the cream of the crop
you know that i mean
everybody's different so you're not
going to get only the cream of the crop
but i think on average you're bringing
in the good people and you also need
people to do every other kind of job in
society
now here's another
another thing to think of
can the united states survive if our
birth rate falls
and what would happen to our natural
birth rate if we didn't have massive
immigration i'm not in fa i'm not in
favor of massive immigration
i'm just asking the question
what would happen to our birth rate
if we didn't have massive immigration
it wouldn't sustain the country it's a
problem
we actually need young people
economically
it's a requirement
where were they going to come from
we weren't going to have them
i mean i suppose we could have done some
massive
persuasion to get americans you know who
are already here to have more babies
i don't know that that would work
i feel as if the one and only way that
you can
be economically viable is to bring in
young people if you're not making young
people you have to bring them in and
bring in populations that have more more
babies
now
am i arguing therefore that we should
open the borders and just let everybody
in now
that's crazy
the way we're doing it now
crazy it's all wrong
what i'm arguing and i've always argued
is you need a totally secure border
and then you can decide based on
economics
based on economics
how many to let in in any given
any given year and maybe what types of
people led in
so i think you have to control it
but you gotta you gotta let in a good
number of people i don't know what the
right number is but you almost have to
take immigration and you've got to treat
it pretty seriously
um i can't argue what the absolute
number should be
because
i mean that would take a lot of research
and i'm not even sure you could ever
know that
but i do know you need a lot of it
we may have twice as much as we need
right now
but you need a lot of it
and if you don't have it you're dead
did i make my case
uh with just the argument i gave
that we're really
at least and for the most part we're
trying to pick off the risk takers and
the and the higher quality people from
each
every country that can get here
no
all right so uh as per typical very
rarely do people change their minds
nope nope nope i'm saying lots of no's
what would be your argument
what would be your argument against
the notion that we're
filtering in the right kind of risk
takers and the people who think ahead
that's not who's coming rich guy no i'm
i'm completely aware that there are tons
and tons of
you know just workers coming in because
they heard
they heard the crowd was moving north
and they just got in the line so clearly
there could be tons of people who are
not the cream of the crop i'm not
claiming that
what i am claiming is that we're getting
enough
of the cream of the crop you know the
risk takers
that
we come out ahead
that would be the argument you come out
ahead
even though you bring in a lot of common
laborers who were maybe just going to
break even
economically
you don't need that many superstars
right to start a billion dollar company
etc
yes legal immigration yes
if i didn't say that explicitly i only
favor legal immigration
so i certainly don't favor whatever's
happening now
um diversity of appearance means nothing
if people are thinking the same
well i'm saying that we don't want
diversity
in one way
there's one kind of diversity you don't
want
which is you don't want people who don't
want to be successful
you want the kind of diversity where
it's all kinds of people but they want
to make the world a better place
like that's the diversity you want you
don't want diversity of thought
because like some of them are terrorists
some of them don't want to work
some of them just want you to take care
of them i don't want that diversity
that's the diversity of thought i don't
want at all
i want i want people who have some some
shared notion of the united states and
what success looks like and they want it
that's who i want yeah i get more of
those
anyway i don't think
tucker's uh interpretation of it was
quite spot-on
but very provocative
as he always is
different cultures have different
thoughts
true enough but i do think that the
united states attracts people who have
um on average
compatible notions with freedom and
capitalism
um
i never met an illegal immigrant that
didn't want to get money to take back
home
so
what's wrong with that
what is wrong with that
i mean the the money that they send back
home is what keeps everybody home
if they weren't sending money back home
those people would be coming here too
so i'm not sure that's the negative you
think it is
um just looking at some of your comments
um
you're dreaming if you let me just read
this so hard as they're going by if you
think that getting risk takers who are
going to help grow our comedy
we're seeing people because they're
motivated by the takers
um all right so the point here would be
that
uh the people coming here for free stuff
are the the dominant
thing
maybe
um but would it matter to my point
let's say my point was that we're
bringing the cream of the crop
but you say to me scott scott scott you
might be getting 10 percent like that
but 90 are just people coming here for
free stuff
do you think those immigrants don't want
to work
how many do you think the immigrants
came here for free stuff and and didn't
think they were going to work hard
i feel like zero
we're getting the people who want to
work
more than americans want to work
now when you say free stuff i would just
say that it's a better life
i think they want to give and get also
i don't think they want to get without
working
i think they came here to work
do you really not think they came here
to work
and i think they came here to work under
a system that would reward them better
than the system they were in
what's wrong with that
that's what we all do
we're all doing that we're looking for
the better system that treats us better
for the same amount of work
do you hate him for that all right so
back to my point let's say we got 10 of
the people i'm describing like the
go-getters the risk takers the
entrepreneurs the people planning ahead
and you get 90 percent
of the people who just want to work hard
and have a better life
did you come out ahead or behind
that that's my scenario did you come out
ahead or behind you only got 10 percent
of the people who are awesome
like really think ahead entrepreneurs
going to make this country great
90 are just here because the crowd came
here because it's a better life but they
want to work hard
no doubt they want to work hard
come out ahead or behind
i said john says behind how do you know
are you an economist
i i've got a degree in economics and i
don't know
i feel if i had to guess
i'd say ahead but again it depends on
amount right there's some amount of
immigration that puts you behind there's
some amount that would put you ahead
i don't know where that cutoff point is
but we ought to find it
lyle says scott is surprised his
audience is overwhelmingly racist no i'm
not you think that surprised me
my view uh all people are racist so i
would expect all of my audiences to be
racist all the time no matter who i was
talking to
it's just a complete illusion that
they're non-racist
they're just people who think of it
different ways they communicate
different but the thing that makes
everybody racist is that your brain is a
pattern recognition device
you know your lawnmower can only be a
lawn mower your dishwasher can only be a
dishwasher dishwasher can't mow the lawn
lawnmower can't clean your dishes
all right your brain is just one thing
it's a pattern recognition machine it
can't be anything else
and the problem is that you're bad at
pattern recognition that's all you got
and if you're bad at pattern recognition
as we all are we're all fooled by the
wrong patterns then you end up thinking
well those elbonians they always wear
hats and
you know and eat bananas and
fall on their faces
because you saw three albonians like
that
so of course you're a racist
you cannot be
because your brain is just oriented that
way
now you can use your higher level
thinking to get past it that would be
awesome
but you're starting as a racist
so is my audience racist yeah because
they're humans yeah of course they are
all right that's all for now and i'll
see
