after your beverage
and the louder you scream during sex the
better it is so that's just your tip for
the day
make sure your coffee and your physical
relationships
way better
all right what's going on
we have a new persuasion leader
so yesterday I listened to a radio
interview
Joel Pollock for Breitbart radio was
interviewing RFK Jr
and I did not know how good he was at
this persuasion stuff
he's really good he's better than Trump
now Trump trump is a singular character
who cannot be imitated right so there's
no other Trump trump is just himself so
I get you can't exactly compare them
but I will say that RFK Jr has
uh one thing that Trump absolutely does
not have
which is the ability to say things that
both sides like
Trump is the ultimate warrior for your
team
RFK Jr looks like he's actually trying
to bring the country together
now let me tell you some of the things
he said on this interview I was taking a
walk while I was listening and I just
stopped walking when I heard this see if
the see if this hits you the same way
so uh Joel Pollock it was a great
interview he did an amazing job of
asking the right questions and then
getting out of the way letting him talk
and one of the questions was about how
could he
bring the country together and reduce
the amount of division in the country
now how would you answer that question
I've thought about this so much I
thought well how if I were running like
what would I say
and I I've never thought of anything
I've honestly never thought of anything
that would be an answer to that question
and
RFK Jr answers the question of how he
would create
more unity in the country he says well
we'd start by not lying to the citizens
what
did you really say that
what
oh my God
now you can argue lots of things right
you could say oh he doesn't mean it it's
a political thing right okay or he might
mean it but he can't execute it right it
won't make any difference but have you
ever heard a better answer
that's the better answer that's the best
answer to that question I've ever heard
if you stopped lying to people
what would happen
well if you stopped lying presumably
we'd all think the problem was the same
problem
we wouldn't think the problem was each
other
part of the LIE is that you know the
problem is each other
that's not exactly the problem you know
maybe we have external problems that we
should all get together and work on so
you might recognize this persuasion
technique
it's The High Ground
That's The High Ground when I talk about
The High Ground maneuver and persuasion
it's the one that stops the conversation
so there's not much you can say after
it's been stated
it's like how would you bring the
country together well
I would start by not lying to the
citizens
okay
uh
and my my problem with that would be
I got nothing
I got nothing
and I don't believe that there are
claims against RFK Jr that he's lied
I mean every public figure is going to
have some kind of claims but I don't
believe anybody says he's a liar so what
he says I'm gonna you know tell you the
truth
it does look like he has some sense that
there's a truth that's independent from
politics he actually sells that idea
that there might be a truth that's
independent from the two teams
oh my god did I like hearing that all
right here's something else he talks
about
I thought his uh I thought his toughest
challenge was going to be explaining his
vaccination stand
because his own party is pro-vaccination
and he's he's at least known
reputationally as the person who's
talked the most about the risks of
vaccinations
so you think that would be bad
but
in the Covenant vaccinations he's pretty
close to the Republican view that they
weren't tested enough
right so he's got the Republican side
agreeing with him now how in the world
could he convince Democrats the
vaccinations were
may be riskier than they thought how in
the world could you do that it's
impossible right I mean the we're
talking about the childhood vaccinations
not just covered so here's how he did it
in like one minute
he said when I was a kid I got three
vaccinations now the kid today will get
a 72.
and I said
what
what
is that true
and I I think three was about the right
number when I was a kid and I thought
that's actually true 72 but then I
thought oh oh okay right that's a little
alarmist isn't it because you know you
know the 72 if there are 72 I don't know
if there are 72
you know that they were tested with the
randomized controlled trial you know
they waited five years before they gave
it to anybody right obviously
what
no it turns out they didn't do any of
that it turns out when the law changed
some years ago as RFK explains Junior
explains that when the law changed to
make their no liability
for vaccinations a bunch of them were
produced and do you know what no
liability would include
not properly testing them
it's actually legal to not properly test
your vaccinations
what and specifically when I say not
test them it doesn't mean there were no
tests I'm not saying there were no tests
I'm saying they didn't do randomized
controlled trials and they didn't wait
five years to see if there were any
surprises
so RFK Juniors position
is The High Ground again
how in the world did he find The High
Ground twice when it was invisible to me
and here's The High Ground I'm not
saying vaccinations are bad I'm saying
that they should be at least tested in a
randomized controlled trial
and at least wait five years to see if
there are any surprises because that's
somewhat not strange for there to be a
surprise in five years
now who argues with that
nobody literally nobody
he actually found The High Ground where
the Republicans would say well yeah that
makes sense
and the Democrats are going to say what
I thought we were already doing that of
course that makes sense
how in the world did he do that well
nobody else could find that
all the politicians in the world were
looking for the the thing that both
sides would agree with and he's the only
one who could find it twice
all right how about this
um
that he talked about the fact that kids
are having all these chronic diseases
that he'd literally never heard of when
he was a kid
and I thought I've said that too haven't
you noticed the same thing when I was a
kid I never heard of anybody with ADD
maybe it existed I don't know I never
heard of anybody with anxiety
never heard of anybody with autism
I've never heard of it there were things
that just didn't exist and now it's yeah
in trans you know uh sexual just what's
a dysphoria I get the dysmorphian
dysphoria confused I think it's
dysphoria is the right word
now
my one criticism is he should have
mentioned diet
at the same time he was speculating that
we're putting a lot of chemicals into
kids at the same time that all these
chronic conditions are being surfaced
that didn't exist before
I don't think it's just vaccinations if
vaccinations have anything to do with it
I don't know
but I would like to see him say
something about more about the food
system
but he probably does he probably does if
he asked him he'd probably say yeah
that's something to look into I I I'm
sure he wouldn't ignore the food system
I'd just like to see him throw it in
there when he talks about vaccinations
and chronic disease he talked about uh
government by bullying being
unacceptable
do you disagree do you disagree that
your government should not be a bully
yeah it's The High Ground everybody
agrees with that
all right
um
and then
his uh his opinion on pollution and a
lot of things for environment is that
the free market should figure this stuff
out he's actually a free market guy
so I heard something that you know I was
like oh he's going to be more
environmental than
maybe you think is a good idea like
you'll be too too much of an
environmentalist for Republicans you
know Republicans are like we like the
environment but just don't go crazy
that's sort of the Republican View
and
you know I worried well okay he's never
going to pass the climate change bar
like you know no Republicans going to be
comfortable with him on climate change
or anything else
but his view is that the free market
should be making our decisions not the
governments
and that if you allow the externalities
of the businesses to be part of their
cost basis in other words instead of
making the public pay for their
pollution
which is the current situation you
figure a way that the free market says
well if you can't make a non-polluting
thing you're gonna have to pay for it
and if somebody makes one a competing
product that doesn't compete that
doesn't pollute well they're the winner
so
free market is another High Ground
for at least everybody but the super
progressives it's another High Ground so
he's finding the high grounds like crazy
I would keep an eye on him my take on
RFK Jr is that the reason they had to
change the
the schedule of the Democrat primaries
is that RFK Jr would have done well in
New Hampshire maybe other people too
and we know that Biden does not do well
in New Hampshire
um
so moving South Carolina to the first
one will big Biden start off with a
strong state
and it'll make him look inevitable so
that little change was made so basically
the Democrats have already rigged
yeah I would call it rigged I got some
pushback on Twitter
when I said it was rigged and somebody
said rigged rigged you say what is wrong
you tell me what's wrong with changing
it from the first primary is a is a
little white state with hardly any
people in it and they're going to be
like you know so influential on the
whole process tell me how that's right
compared to having a big state that's
got far more diversity being the most
important one tell me why that makes
sense
here was my answer
didn't it always make sense
did it just start making sense in 2023
I'm not I'm not arguing it doesn't make
sense
I I have no opinion on how the Democrats
hold their primaries all I've noted is
if they have not made that change this
year it would have been really bad for
the incumbent
and so you know it's not a question of
whether it makes sense yeah it makes
sense
it kind of makes sense there's an
argument for both sides you know the the
retail
the shake the hands you know look you in
the eye kind of thing in New Hampshire
is kind of unique but on the other hand
is a very white state
that's a true statement too
so I don't care which way they do it
it's just disingenuous to say that they
were simply in 2023 they simply decided
to upgrade their system in a way that
had nothing to do with who they wanted
to win they were just upgrading their
system in a totally normal way that
happens
routinely now nothing like that happened
it's a rigged system
all right legally totally legally rigged
all right
um
here's a let's see
yeah well enough about that
so all the smart people in politics are
saying that Biden really really wants
Trump to be his com his opponent
do you believe that
do you believe that uh Biden really
really wants it to be Trump
yeah I believe it I believe it uh
because he won once that way so he
probably figures it'll happen again now
do you think that Trump really really
really wants to run up against Biden
do you think Trump wants to run against
Biden
it's kind of weird because I think the
answer is yes
so here we have all the the smartest
people in politics telling you that
Biden wants to run against Trump because
he has such an advantage but also Trump
wants to run against Biden because Trump
has such an advantage
there's your experts you want to hear
something else that RFK Jr said that
just blew me that
foa
he said that listening to The Experts is
our biggest problem or I'm paraphrasing
he didn't say it's the biggest problem
he said you shouldn't listen to experts
he actually said that
here's what he said he talked about some
trial or some situation he was with
where they had all the best ivy league
experts and they looked at the data and
they came up with an opinion and then he
had a separate group who were on the
other side who had the same credentials
from Ivy League schools they looked at
the same data and came to an opposite
conclusion and he and he said quite
rightly if the experts look at the same
data and come to opposite conclusions
what good are the experts
do you disagree with that no it's The
High Ground again
it's High Ground let me um
talk to PJ there
so I'm seeing some people on YouTube who
maybe are less familiar with me
saying that I'm fanboying over RFK Jr
I'm fanboying over his talent his
persuasion Talent same thing I do with
Trump same thing I do with the Vivek
we'll talk about Rama Swami in a minute
but when they do things that are good
persuasion and good technique I'm very
complimentary
you should note I've said the same thing
about Obama
you should note I've said the same thing
about Bill Clinton
and Ronald Reagan right there's some
people who just have more skill
so I'm talking about the skill you can
make up your own mind about the politics
is that fair
so the fanboying is just about the skill
but that's real I'm definitely fan
fanboying over the skill
all right
um
so Biden pushing his idea to uh
you know that he hopes he's running
against Trump and probably well it looks
it's looking that way at this point
but
so Biden is pushing his uh old technique
because it worked before and the old
technique is to talk about uh Mega
extremists
now I'm going to call this the Elmer
Fudd strategy
so Biden has taken on the Elmer flood
strategy and it goes like this
uh I'm I'm hunting those Mega extremists
those Rascals
those megaxtubeist where are those Mega
extremists
they're all over those Rascals I'm
hunting them
so every time I hear uh Biden talk about
Maggie extremists I'm going to compare
him to Elmer Fudd
because he's always looking for that
rascally rabbit that he can't can't seem
to shoot
yeah there's all these Mega extremists
where are they extremists
I think there's a mega extremist under
my bed
is there a mega extremist under your bed
those whistles
I can't even take him seriously can you
I mean how in the world do you take
Biden seriously somebody says he's Mr
Magoo
but I I think Elmer funds are better
because he's literally hunting
he's hunting
you know Republicans as the Democrats
are
and it's just so comically ridiculous
and absurd that he thinks the the Maga
extremists are the big problem in the
country
if you were to make a list of the
biggest problems in the country and you
started at the top
most of the things on the top would be
Biden's fault
like inflation
uh the war in Ukraine
uh yeah the the Border being opened
fentanyl flying over almost everything
is our biggest problems if you're going
to make a list from worse worst to
smallest our biggest problems are all
Biden themselves literally things he
 up
and he's decided that he's going to make
us concentrate on those wascally
um mega exquis
they're all over have you seen them
they're so dangerous those Mega
extremists
that I've literally never met
I bet you've ever met a mega extremist
like actually a real one
I haven't I've never been one I mean not
in person I I'll see stuff on social
media and I'll go oh that looks like a
little bit LARPing or those are just
people who like to March around with
guns and talk politics
I mean I know the type it's a type who
likes to have guns and they like to talk
politics and they might talk politics
and talk about their guns at the same
time
so they look like
all right
I saw a tweet uh
that men would rather sext a bot than go
to therapy
and so the question will be
AI as a therapist versus a human
therapist and if a man is using uh a
female voiced AI
for a therapy
how long before it turned sexual
because
the only thing that stops men from
hitting on their female therapists in
the real world is that they won't get
away with it right they'll have to find
a new therapist but if your therapist is
an AI you might be thinking well
I could take my shot
I'll take my shot
you never know maybe we become lifelong
friends and companions as Bots you know
we live in a strange time because there
will be people falling in love with AI
you believe that right
does anybody doubt that that there will
be real live legitimate humans who have
Financial relationship with AI
you know that's coming right now you can
call it a mental disorder but you can't
say it's not coming
because we got a lot of mental disorders
yeah that's coming but here's what's
interesting about this day and time
today if you fall in love with an AI
which will definitely happen
it won't have a body
but you'll be at the time in history
when bodies are being invented for your
AI
and you will work with your AI you know
the two of you will work together toward
a future where they can build your AI a
body
that can walk around and hang out with
you
you know more than just picking up your
phone maybe it can give you a back rub
or something
or more I know what you're thinking
yeah they put a flashlight in his mouth
and you're good to go so
um you didn't hear me say that
yeah anyway so I think a whole lot of
lonely people are going to be saving up
money to buy a body for the AI that they
fell in love with
that's that's real don't you think
you don't think people will be saving up
to buy a body for the AI they fell in
love with
they will I guarantee you you're going
to see this story in in the news in five
years I guarantee it all right
let's talk about Tucker Carlson because
everything about Tucker is fun
um
so the Wall Street Journal is
everybody's speculating about what was
the real reason what's the real reason
the one reason that's bigger than the
other reasons and I'm convinced there's
not one reason
does anybody think that Tucker got taken
off the air apparently he's not fired
he's still on the payroll he just can't
do a show uh
does anybody think it was for one reason
because I feel like that's the worst
take that there was one reason no it was
like several things sort of added up and
at some point it was too much yeah the
Dominion thing and the advertisers
weren't coming in but they do make their
money from uh
cable carriers paying them to be on the
air
right so if you're a cable network
and you want to offer a cable to your
community you don't want to offer it
unless Fox News is on there and CNN and
you know the big ones so Fox News just
pays the gets paid by the cable
operators to put content on their on
their pipes
so they don't need advertising
per se they're getting their money from
the carriage
if that's a word
so
um I think then the the weirdest one I
heard was that uh Rupert Murdoch was
engaged briefly for like two weeks but
the woman he was engaged to and called
it off her favorite show was Tucker
Carlson and she thought Tucker Carlson
was the best and that uh maybe maybe
Rupert Murdoch was just being small and
Petty and taking his uh ex-fiancee's
favorite Talent off the air
I don't think that's it
yeah yeah I don't know Rupert Murdoch so
I can't read his mind but I will put
that at the lowest end of possibility
I don't think that was part of it all
right
um
but it appears to me that uh Tucker is
right about everything
so here are some of the things that
Tucker told us often
Tucker told us that Free Speech was
under assault right don't you think that
that was probably one of the biggest
messages he would hit in every angle in
every way the Free Speech was under
assault and what happened
he lost his platform
he lost his free speech
so
that kind of looks real
he also seemed to agree with me but not
using the word hunted that there was
clearly some kind of a trend against
right-leaning people
and then his advertisers get boycotted
and he's taken off there
so he was right
he was right that the people on the
right are being targeted
um
let's see uh let's see what else oh the
other thing that Tucker used to say that
would drive me crazy until I realized he
was right is that Democrats do whatever
they accuse you of doing
so what was the main thing that Tucker
was accused of by his worst critics
being a racist right being like a secret
racist
and Don Lemon
gets kicked out of his job
at least in part for being a racist
so he said some racist stuff to Vivek
ramaswamy people think that might add
something to do with his getting canned
but there's also the video of him
talking to Chris Cuomo on CNN in his
other job his prior job for CNN in which
he says the biggest risk to America is
uh White supremacists
or basically white people it sounded
like
uh and I thought well there's something
you know a white man couldn't say about
a black man it's obviously racist
and I thought
there it is that that's the Tucker
Carlson
theory that they will blame they will
accuse you of being a racist if they are
racist and there it was
sure enough
all right uh white men are the biggest
risks to the country yeah that's what
Don Lemon said
uh then we said to Vivek on his show
more recently he said to uh Vivek Rama
Swami when you have black skin and you
live in this country then you can
disagree with me
about slavery and stuff
all right
uh here's more from Greg price talking
about Tucker's lawsuit so one of his
producers
is suing him for promoting a hostile
work environment
uh
anti-summer semitism
and I don't even know what the
accusation of that is like what exactly
would be the accusation of anti-Semitism
you'll probably never hear any examples
of that I'll bet
I'll bet you'll never hear it all right
um
and she she was very uncomfortable the
producer was suing him uh that Tucker
had so much power over politics and knew
it
so Tucker knew that he could influence
who got elected on the Republican side
now is that a problem
he happened to be the most he was the
most popular show
among the Republicans is that like a big
a surprising shocking thing that he was
aware that his impact would change could
change an election or change votes
that's the most obvious thing in the
world uh of course he was aware now she
claims that he bullied people to come on
the show
by saying you know if you don't your
career will be ruined if you don't come
on my show
but that was also true wasn't it
I know is it a
is it a threat I mean she acted like it
was bullying or you know sort of
blackmailing him or something but is it
a threat if it's just a statement of
obvious fact that if somebody doesn't
come on the air to defend their point of
view
then when he talks about their point of
view he will not have the benefit of
their defense
which is probably pretty bad for them
to me that just sounds like a statement
of the fact I'm going to talk about this
if you're not there to defend yourself
then there won't be a defense because I
don't know what the defense is
to me that sounds like telling them
what their risk reward situation is what
was he supposed to do not tell the story
well what was his alternative all right
I'm inviting you on to talk about this
you specifically you're the one who
cares you're the one who disagrees I'm
inviting you on
what is he supposed to cancel the show
if they say no
it's still the same show he's got to do
the show
so warning them that there's a downside
to not showing up feels entirely fair to
me although I can see why it's coercive
is certainly coercive but it's also true
and it's also Fair
in the sense that you know it seems
reasonable to warn somebody what the
consequences are
and I would also imagine that that's not
that different than other big shows in
history they probably always have that
Veiled Threat
um it has a Greg price points out
there's this big New York Times article
about this lawsuit and nowhere in the
New York's times coverage according to
Greg do they mention the following fact
remember this is a this is a producer
who's suing over a hostile work
environment and alleged anti-semitism
what was not mentioned is that Tucker
Carlson has never been in the same room
with her
don't you think that's important they've
never been in the same room he's worked
remotely from his studios in Maine in
Florida I guess since the beginning of
the pandemic
never even met now of course they would
have worked remotely a lot
but never met
yeah I created a hostile podcast by
using bad words too
um
and then did anybody see her how many of
you saw the video of her giving an
interview on MSNBC or something
so her name is Abby grossberg
did anybody see it
and
did you have any uh
reactions now I'm not talking about the
the fact that she has a Jewish last name
that is not my topic
no no no no no
I I'm not going to say it
no it has nothing to do with her her
ethnicity or background or religion or
anything so nothing about that
nothing about that there wasn't
something else you notice about her
I can't be the only one
say it there we go
there we go somebody else said it
uh
no nothing about being Jewish that's not
the topic
all right so a few of you saw what I saw
okay
I'm not going to say it
all right
um let's just say that the way she
presents herself
raises some questions that's all
just raises some questions
all right
um
here's a word solid example so I like to
teach you that when people have nonsense
opinions they will devolve into word
salad meaning they'll put words together
but they won't actually make any any
sense I want to give you another good
example of it
so there's a school board director Scott
Clifton
and I guess they're going to stop music
instruction in part because it's uh uh
white supremacy
music music lessons in school or white
supremacy
and so here are some of the things that
the school board director said
uh
that some schools provide the instrument
courses at times that would require some
students to miss core instruction
okay so that's important I don't know
how that's a racial thing
unless there's more of it in some
schools than others but it's not
mentioned and then he goes on to say now
listen to the listen for the word salad
this is just a classic one right
quote we're a school district that lives
in is entrenched in
is surrounded by white supremacy culture
and that's a real thing Clifton said and
then he went on
here's the word salad there's nothing
about strings or wind instrument music
that is intrinsically white supremacist
well that's good that he noticed that
that the instruments themselves are not
not intrinsically white supremacist it's
good that he noted that but he goes on
he goes however the ways in which it is
and the ways in which all of our
institutions not just schools local
government state government churches or
neighborhoods inculcate and allow white
supremacy culture to continue to be
propagated and cause significant
institutional violence are things that
we have to think about carefully as a
community
and I think that we have to do that
interrogation and we have to address the
ways in which it creates challenges for
administrating the educational day of
our elementary Learners while we while
we retain the program meaning the music
program
did any of that make any sense
I don't think that made any sense
oh there's a story here
uh oan is making an offer
some other people are making offers now
I don't think I believe that Tucker
Carlson cannot entertain other offers
yet because he's still an employee of
Fox News so Fox News
maintained him as an employee they just
took a show away
so imagine if you were him
and he can make I don't know 20 million
a year or whatever it is from just
staying home
presumably but he can't and he can't
look for a new job and he can't do
anything else
do you think that at his age and his
level of impact he would be okay with
being prevented from doing a show
somewhere else
that would be an interesting negotiation
because
he might have to give up some of his
money
you know say something like all right I
won't take 40 million dollars but give
me 20 million dollars
but let me go get another job
so Fox News could save 20 million
dollars potentially by saying all right
we won't keep you here in limbo for two
years
and you only get 20 million so we'll
save half of that money
yeah we'll see
um
China is uh I guess trying to talk to
zelenski president she did and now China
is going to send some of its diplomats
over there to talk to people and see if
they can get this Wharf straightened out
and solved
um
now do you think that China is going to
broker a peace deal with Ukraine and
Russia
no
I don't think so
but it's good cover because everybody's
saying that China is happy about the
Ukraine Russia War because it would keep
America to bogged down it'd be too
expensive to protect Taiwan or something
so from the Chinese perspective this is
good politics
but I don't think it's anything else
all right
let's talk about e Gene Carroll and her
lawsuit against Trump
before many years ago allegedly
raping her in the dressing room of
Bergdorf Goodman
now my understanding is that the entire
case revolves on her testimony
and some people at the time that she may
have told the story
am I right
that's the only evidence
that she says it happened
and that she allegedly told people at
the time who were willing to testify
now is that enough
I don't want to live in a world where
that's enough
to have a lawsuit work
you need somebody to see it you need
some physical evidence you need some DNA
I'm going to need a lot more than that
because apparently there's a quote I
don't know if this is true but there's a
quote that said she loved the Apprentice
if it's true
if it's true that she loved the
Apprentice
how in the world could you get a jury to
convict Trump
how in the world could you get a jury to
get not convect it's a I guess it's a
lawsuit so a lawsuit you don't need a 12
euros you just need a majority right
yeah maybe she'll make some money but uh
I don't see how she could win apparently
the Trump's defense is no defense
the the case is so weak that the defense
is going to say well we'll just talk to
you about your allegations and that's
all we have to do you know once we've
shown that it's just somebody talking
that should be all we need
all right well I don't see him having
much Jeopardy for that case but it's a
pain in the ass
well Matt Gates has become the new Joe
manchin and by that as you know the
uh the Congress is trying to figure out
how to raise the debt ceiling so that we
can continue borrowing money like
drunken Sailors uh
but the Republicans are pushing back
trying to guess something in exchange
for approving it
um
all right
so Matt Gates is holding off because
let's see he's asking for something uh
so Republicans agreed to allow proposed
work requirements for Medicaid so if you
were getting Medicaid you'd have some
kind of work requirement
and I guess that's something that Matt
Gates is pushing for
and you know I've talked about how Joe
manchin really for a while anyway seemed
like he ran the country because he was
the only Democrat in their thin majority
well you know maybe one other but he was
the one who was most likely to vote
either way so that gave him all the
power everybody had to make him happy
because he could go either way the
people who are just going to always vote
for their team
yeah and Kristen Cinema too so the
people are only going to vote for their
team have no power
they've given away all their power so
Matt Gates being Apparently one of the
smarter Republicans realized that his
personal ability to get things done
would be very connected to his ability
to vote against his own party you know
he he voted he was going to vote against
McCarthy until he got some stuff now
he's pushing McCarthy again until he
gets some stuff
and it looks like it might work
so Matt Gates is the new Joe manchin and
I say that as a compliment
you know this is just free money it's
like Gates is just picking up free money
every day so all I have to do is
threaten that I won't Vote for This
Republican thing really I just have to
threaten it and then they'll give me
some stuff okay you got some stuff
for the country all right
I'm going to call down some fake news
about Joe Biden
so I call this semi-fake news it's
something he really said but I think the
context is weak
so here's what he said at some event and
out loud he said
there's no such thing as someone else's
child
and that the implication is no he's
saying parents don't have control he's
saying that the government raises your
child
I don't think so that's not how I took
it I took it as just a different way to
say it takes a village
you know yet you need not just the
parents you're going to need the help of
other people to build good citizens
which is totally true
of course you're going to need everybody
to do the right thing to get good
children but that doesn't take the
control away from the parents however
to back your interpretation for a while
it is that slippery slope problem you
always worry about right
that if you're allowed to say out loud
the sentence there's no such thing as
someone else's child which in context
means that you don't ignore the fact
that someone else's child is suffering
right so the context I see it is if you
walked into a grocery store and you saw
an undetended toddler
who is in trouble
use some kind of trouble
as an adult you would stop everything
and you would help the toddler although
you are not their parent
right and it doesn't take anything away
from the responsibility of the parent
because you don't know where they are or
why they're not there you know maybe
there's some story you don't know about
but you wouldn't stop
you wouldn't you wouldn't stop yourself
from helping the the toddler right
you're going to help the toddler
so even though it's not your kid
so if the implication is we should all
be helping because you know kids are our
future and parents can't do it all
I like that but you could easily see
this drift into the the government is in
control and you parents better do what
we say
you can see it drifting but I don't
think that the proper context has been
put on this story so just want to give
you the proper context
all right
um
there is some risk involved
speaking of RFK Jr and saying that we
should tell the truth
is the problem with the uh the big
explosion in trans
identification
especially with women apparently young
women or young girls
are far more likely to identify as trans
if one of their friends did
but I don't know if I don't know if
that's really a causation or correlation
thing because you can imagine that
people who feel a certain way
end up with friends who feel a certain
way
so does it really tell you anything that
if the friend decides they're trans that
the person who had a lot in common with
them and that's why they're friends
also thinks that
yes I mean peer pressure is certainly a
factor but probably not as big as it
looks because there might be some kind
of a filtering thing where you just look
at other people and you go I think
you're one of me so I'm going to hang
out with you
yeah this is some of that but
can we say the following thing without
being canceled I'll try let's see if I
can say the following thing without
being canceled
uh
gender let's see if I have the right
words gender dysphoria
is a real thing
does anybody disagree
gender dysphoria there are people who
apparently have
some genetic propensity to not be
cleanly identifiable as one thing
now how rare it is is in the next
question
can we say that that's real while also
saying well also saying that there's
something about the topic that attracts
people with mental illness
to say they are also that
can't we say both
can't we say that there are two problems
here one is there are people who have
this situation which sounds pretty uh
unpleasant
and I have empathy for anybody who's got
any medical problem that or anything
else
but
can't we also say that it's attracting a
whole bunch of people who
are not mentally as capable
as you would want them to be to make
that kind of decision for themselves
those both could be true
it's just that none of us know the
percentages
so where it gets I think where it gets
obnoxious is where you imagine you know
the percentage
I mean I can guess
you know I can take a guess
uh
okay
so they're somebody saying that there
are other lifestyle things that might
come along with gender dysphoria so
there might be some
lifestyle diet or other endocrine
contributors I don't know I so I think
most of us are in the dark about the you
know the specific medical situation but
if we if we can all agree
that there's a real thing there the real
thing real people need empathy and
if they're adults anyway we would all
agree that if there's some health care
intervention that's going to maybe make
them happier I wouldn't deny anybody the
chance to try to be happier
but then again the kid things is
different
let me ask you this
if I ask you the question this way I
know I know the answer if I said should
minors make permanent decisions about
transitioning
you'd probably say no
miners should not
right
so
but
there are lots of situations where we
were a little flexible about what it
means to be a minor
right there are things where you have to
be 21.
there are things where you have to be
18.
but puzzlingly
you could be 15 and a half and drive a
car
right which is really dangerous stuff
you can you know be in the military at
18 right
so
you know we we do look at different
topics and say all right that one maybe
you could be 16 even with uh the age of
consent
the age of consent is different in
different states that's sort of the
ultimate you know Mark of are you an
adult can you can you engage in this
activity so we don't even agree on that
so would you agree with the general
statement
that there are a whole bunch of things
in the category of things where the the
young person doesn't have full
mental capacity
but we still allow them to do some
things some things
and some of those have permanent impact
such as driving a car that's pretty
permanent
yeah I mean if you do it wrong so
let me just throw this question out here
would you violently object
to a 17 and a half year old
Consulting with parents so the parents
are in on it
the doctors are in on it
and it's something that they've
struggled with for 17 or you know I
don't
12 years or something
in that very specific case would you
would you allow an exception
very specific
17 and a half they're definitely not
going to change their mind in six months
so in six months it's going to happen
anyway their parents are on board
the doctors are on board
so there's still some no's yeah a lot of
no's but what's Magic about turning 18.
because we know that your brain is not
sort of solidified until you're 25. why
is 18 okay but 25 isn't better
so let me let me ask the second question
since we know the human brain doesn't
really get to its sort of best state
until at least 25. why would you let
somebody who is 24.
have surgery
knowing that they're not fully capable
they're not 25 yet
some of this is
is really tough here let me let me give
you my take here's my take
Freedom has to be the first requirement
unless there's something special going
on
would you agree with the general
statement Freedom has to be the top
requirement unless there's something
really specific going on now that's the
that's really Edge case for the trans
situation
because in the trans situation if it's
an adult
almost all of you would say well that's
an adult they can do what they want so
very few I don't think I've seen ever
I've never seen a republican say they
care what an adult does with their body
but then you start getting into the
older teenage years and then there's
more of a battle between freedom
and do we need to go interfere in your
life it's not our life it's not my life
do I do I need to be part of interfering
with some other family
for a 17 year old 17 and a half year old
who's got responsible parents who are
talking to their medical professionals
is that my business
is that my business because if it's my
business I might stop everybody until
they're 25.
would that be the right decision
if I make it my business to get into
other people's private lives
now
if it's a toddler
and the parents have somehow gotten the
medical professional to agree that
they're going to transition a toddler
well maybe you want to get involved
that that might be too far over your
line you go oh whoa that's just child
abuse that's
yeah that might be your opinion so I
would just like to uh
put a little less certainty on this
conversation
a little less certainty
yeah was it don't say bad take bad take
I can't respect I can respect
here's my Counterpoint I don't respect
bad take
that I have no respect for that that
comment at all
all right
um objective reality exists
yeah but objective reality exists but
that has nothing to do with this topic
my topic has nothing to do with
objective reality because we don't have
access to it what we have is how people
feel and then they're going to act that
way and freedom allows us to act on what
we feel unless it's some kind of special
case
where somebody else is going to get hurt
uh
all right
objective reality is morality I don't
think you can find the bright line of
morality in this situation
I don't think so
um
all right here's Scott krogg asking a
dumbass question
Scott
do you want some flexibility at 10 11
and 12 years old ask better questions
all right that's just a stupid question
right ask better questions
why does my opinion matter at all
my my opinion of anything shouldn't be
even part of the topic right I used my
opinion as an example but you shouldn't
care what my opinion is and nobody
should
my opinion should be absolutely zero
interest to anybody
no interest whatsoever all right
that let's see if I missed anything oh
yeah did you know that uh I've been
saying zevec ramaswamy and that's not
how you pronounce his name his first
name I I saw this on gav Feld last night
that it's Vivek rhymes with cake
Vivek how many of you knew that and let
me say it wrong for weeks
some of you do
and then I saw other people say that
there are some people who pronounce the
same spelling differently for different
people
Maybe
do you think that uh Vivek got Don Lemon
fired because in that conversation Don
Lemon
said something about you know unless you
were born in this country and they have
black skin you shouldn't be telling me
about
slavery or something
I don't think that's what I don't think
it was yeah that that just sounds like a
pundit thing to talk about I don't think
he got on fire
I think they're ready to make that
change
all right so uh
let me tell you what I'd love to see
I would love to see a voluntary debate
between Vivek and uh RFK Jr
would you love that
wouldn't you love that
because we're we're expecting the two
senior citizens to get the primary
nomination but I feel like we have an
obligation as Citizens see if you agree
with this
I believe we have an obligation as
Citizens
to make sure there's another option
doesn't mean you have to pick it you
know your vote's still your vote you get
to do whatever you want but I don't feel
like there's an option
and I feel like
to the to the degree that we can maybe
generate one with our Collective
energies I would love to see the let's
say the JV team debate
because if the JV team debates and
people say uh
that was the debate I wanted
because you know if it's if it's Biden
and Trump debating what are you going to
get
you're going to get Biden lying
and then Trump lying
it's just going to be two Liars
who wants to see a debate between two
Liars I mean I say lots of good things
about Trump but he doesn't pass the fact
Jackie when he's debating and nobody
would say that so
Vivek and RFK Jr are very unusual
characters at a very unusual time
which is I think they both tell the
truth
am I wrong
so we've got two you know Ultra senior
citizens who are famous for lying
literally famous as their brand they're
famous Liars right both of them
and here you've got two people who are
totally qualified right
you know left and right and though they
are the ones I want to see debate
let's see them debate because that's the
one I would tune into I mean I'd
probably tune into anything with Trump
because he makes news but
uh you had 69's pushing it
yeah
RFK Junior 69 that does pushing the edge
but I think that's still within the
envelope
70s doesn't scare me like 80s do 80s
just scare me 70s it's not such a big
deal
so let's see if we can make that happen
okay
let's see if we can get now the reason I
think it could happen is you've noticed
that RFK Jr has been willing
to appear on now bright radio it's been
on Tucker Carlson show and Tucker had a
show so we we know that RFK Jr will go
where the fight is like he'll go to the
fight he's not going to run away from
certain outlets and we know that uh
Vivek will do the same because he goes
to CNN
so you have the the two young people who
have not yet pissed off people so badly
that the other side won't even talk to
him or that it would be some kind of a
you know political suicide if you went
on that other network they're both brave
enough and smart enough that they can
walk into the the den of the Lions and
then come out
right who do you want as your president
I want somebody who can walk you into
the Den of Lions
and walk out
and they've both proven they can do that
they've both been on the what I would
call less friendly Network to their
message and they both came out looking
great
both of them that those are the two I
want to see duke it out right that that
would be good for the country and I
would like to publicly thank both of
them
because let's see if you agree with the
statement
uh whether it's happened yet that might
be a little more controversial but don't
you think that having the two of them
in the conversation
make everybody a better politician and
probably makes the pundits better too
because they have you know reasonable
things to talk about now instead of
crazy
so big thanks to both of them for
getting in when the the odds of Victory
are low
and yet they're both putting a whole
bunch of you know time and energy which
I see as nothing but patriotism
now you can always argue oh people like
power blah blah blah that's probably
true but both of their actions look to
me
pretty cleanly patriotic like I get a
Vibe like they both think the country is
broken and they've got some ideas to fix
it and they think that the people in
charge don't have the right ideas or the
right skills or the right incentives to
fix it to me they both look like
Patriots I would love
to see two honest brilliant people on
opposite sides
barely opposite because you know again
RFK Jr does these High Ground things
where he does find
agreement
so
what could be better than those two
having a debate and by the way it would
be the the thing I think would do the
best job of making them legitimate
competition for the two presumed
candidates
all right
can something like that get more
attention than the hateful alternative
of the old man yelling it depends where
the platform is
if if somebody like Joe Rogan hosted
them
yeah it would give so much attention you
couldn't believe it right
yeah uh
who would be a good who would be the
best
host moderator
yeah I don't think I don't think it'd be
Joe Rogan because that would be a
more overtly political than he usually
does
malice would be interesting Dave Rubin
would be great
Megan Kelly
Mike Rowe shellenberger I'm trying to
see anybody who is not controversial to
one side or the other
pretty much everybody is a controversial
figure aren't they
it's precarnish I like Smerconish
I would take some recanish out of that
whole list
yeah
I would take some recanish
or uh
I'll take uh van Jones
Russell Brand Russell Brand
Brett Bear Brett Bear is good
yeah
Matt taibi he's a little uh politically
hot at the moment Megan Kelly is great
but she's associated with one side
I mean she would do a terrific job but I
think she's associated with the one side
Jimmy Dore interesting
Lex Friedman
um
yeah maybe yeah maybe Lex Friedman
I Lex Friedman puts on a good show
right so he just he does generally just
a good job of everything he does so that
that argues for him
Harvey Keitel
now Jordan Peterson I think is
identified with one side a little bit
too much
all right lost enough on that YouTube
thanks for joining
I'm gonna go do something else you're
the best except for the locals people
