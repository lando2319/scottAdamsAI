welcome to the highlight of your whole
damn life yes everything from the moment
of your conception has been pointing at
this moment
good luck you made it you made it all
away from the that spunky little uh
sperm that made it to the egg
and from there
an unbroken chain of cause and effect
brought you to me
well it's about time
and
and uh how would you like to take it up
another notch of course of course you
would all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker jealous inside the
canteen jungle flask vessel vedicine
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dopa
being hit of the day it's the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous except
and watch it do its work now go
oh yeah
oh
all right the most important story of
the day is uh follow up you heard the
story a few days ago a hundred monkeys
were in a truck on the way to a lab in
Pennsylvania and there was a traffic
mishap of some kind and uh some monkeys
escaped
some monkeys escaped but we have good
news about the monkeys they have all
been identified so we know where all the
monkeys are now they haven't all been
collected up because it turns out that
several of the monkeys uh we're able to
integrate into society and take jobs
so in case you're wondering what kind of
jobs the monkey's got
three of them are fact Checkers for
Facebook
two of them are in charge of emergency
use authorizations recovered and one of
them is Joe Biden's speechwriter
specifically for his Open Mic comments
right they already had a speechwriter
for his regular speeches but they needed
someone for the open mic situations so
one of those monkeys filled in and I
don't know if he heard but
that monkey is killing it
That Monkey
is really doing a good job for example
you may know that yesterday
uh Peter
was it Peter yeah Peter Ducey
asked the question of Joe Biden that uh
an event an event I don't know a press
conference or something
and uh Ducey yelled as people were
filing out he said
um Mr President I'm paraphrasing do you
think that inflation will be a political
liability going into the midterms
Biden thinking that his microphone might
have been off or maybe he didn't maybe
he thought it was on who knows
muttered under his breath without moving
his lips
kind of like a ventriloquist
yeah inflation's an asset
stupid son of a
now
I suppose I'm supposed to be all
offended or something about his
terrible choice of language I don't find
anything that I don't like about this
story
if ever there were a story where every
bit of it was good
from the left from the right but like
every every part of it I've never seen
the story that I like all of it
all right and there's more to it so
number one was it a uh dumb question
yes yes because nobody thinks that
inflation is going to be a positive but
of course the point of asking questions
to the president is not that you don't
know the answer
right that's not why you asked the
question you asked the question to make
him you know expand on it to get them on
record for something so it's not so much
that you need the information and it's
not it's not like Peter Ducey was
thinking oh I wonder if inflation is a
good thing no he was just trying to get
him on record but you can see that uh
Biden's irritation with that kind of
question
completely understandable uh
my impression of Biden I have to tell
you it went up
it went up I'm not going to be the guy
who says I liked it when Trump was
offensive sounding and I don't like what
Biden is I liked it both
uh I I like this version of Biden and I
would love to find out that he knew that
the microphone was on wouldn't that be
the best
you find out later oh yeah he knew it
was on he'd planned this all along
that would have been just kind of
awesome I think I don't think that's the
case yeah I don't think that's the case
but uh then you wonder how do people
handle criticisms like this from the
president of the United States
well Peter Ducey went on the five
yesterday he was talking to Jesse Waters
and uh when asked about it uh Peter
Ducey when asked about being called a
stupid son of a uh Peter Ducey
smiled and said well nobody's
fact-checked it and said it wasn't true
that my friends is a triple plus
handling of a
of a situation
now the fact that his smile when he said
it looked genuine
it didn't look so much like maybe maybe
he had practice to the line I don't know
but it didn't look like
he felt like he was in any kind of
stress
am I right he looked like he had a good
day
because I think you did yeah honestly if
a president called me a stupid son of a
 in front of the world and it
trended that would be a good day
am I right
is there anybody would disagree with
that if the president of the United
States called you out specifically
and remember he was insulting the
question really right and the question
isn't really you know supposed to be a
real question in the first place
yeah we like we like Biden uh uh five
percent better this morning because of
because of that and I think Peter Ducey
came out looking good too so
everybody won
yeah you hardly ever get a story where
everybody wins but everybody won this
time we got entertained and nobody got
hurt
so good job everybody
speaking of how to handle criticism
we got this suggestion from a Twitter
user called da Noyes
and uh denoya suggests that Biden should
get a new dog and name it Brandon
but to expand on that idea
Adam dopamine on Twitter
give us this visualization picture it
boarded Marine One Biden turns around
whistles and shouts let's go Brandon a
black lab with a red bandana Sprints
down from the White House and into the
chopper
politics aside that level of trolling
would be epic poll numbers up seven
percent overnight
yep
yep we're right on target
uh if if Biden got a dog and named it
Brandon and said let's go Brandon every
time you saw the dog it would totally be
funny
and it would totally diffuse that whole
situation it would be absolutely the
right thing to do as long as you wanted
a dog you know you don't want him to get
a dog just for the political part of it
but if you like the dog that'd be good
news
well Kirsten Cinema in Arizona
Sagittarius and a little a little bit of
uh trouble there's a group called the
voter Latino at least on Twitter
probably it's a real group and uh
they're they're doing a remove Senator
Cinema
campaign
so they're launching the hashtag adios
Cinema campaign
committed to getting rid of her and for
blocking voting rights
now here's my question to you
isn't this foreign interference in our
elections
am I wrong
now I'm now saying that the group doing
it voto Latino I'm not saying that
they're not American because they
probably are I mean they're highly
visible they're doing this I assume it's
Americans but who are they doing it for
am I am I reading too much between the
lines aren't they doing it for the
benefit of non-citizens
isn't that really sort of the point of
it or am I missing the point
yeah I mean I don't I don't know that
they express it that way you know they
they would act like they're they're
helping the Latino or as they say latinx
uh population
but really aren't those voting rights
really sort of aimed at
allowing people who are not citizens
at least some access to voting
it feels like that's you know not the
stated purpose but it seems like that's
the purpose
so but quite seriously am I wrong that
this looks like foreign interference
because this would be empowering people
who are non-citizens to vote in our
election
how is this legal
I I'm actually curious
well under the category of everything
you used to think is right is wrong
which will I think eventually apply to
literally everything
you know literally everything you
thought was right is wrong how many of
you thought that Israel was having a
giant spike in infections even though
everybody is vaccinated how many think
that's true
giant spike in infections even though
uh maybe the highest vaccination rate
how many think that's actually happening
I say yeses I see no's I see truths
and is wildly believed to be true right
have you seen the graph I mean the graph
is just the the hockey stick
the infections on the graph
the data out of Israel would would show
that the number of infections just went
through the roof at the same time
they're highly vaccinated give me a fact
check true or false
Israel has one of the highest
vaccination rates if not the highest
and they also have a giant surge in
infection rate true true
okay here's something else is true
at the same time they had that giant
increase in infections
it's perfectly correlated when they
massively increased testing
true or false
that the massive increase in infections
coincidentally
match the massive increase in new
testing
true I think I mean that's a item from
the news today so there's a fact check
on that saying that it just corresponded
with more testing so that that's
basically that's all we know there was
more testing
so put that in the category of
everything you think is clear and
obvious and true that's probably wrong
probably wrong
uh and maybe home testing somebody says
yeah that might be part of it all right
um let's talk about the Rogue doctors
Dr McCullough making some uh claims I'm
not even going to mention them but they
would he you know let's say non-standard
claims about vaccinations and and the
pandemic it doesn't even matter what his
claim is do you think that people who
are credible debunked all of his claims
within minutes of them hitting Twitter
yes they did
can I tell if the debunks
are more credible than what the doctor
said
no I can't
so
all I know is that he said some things
that sounded pretty convincing
and all I know is the people who
debunked it also sounded pretty
convincing
they also did
so I'm gonna I'm gonna say I don't know
I don't know I usually believe the
debunkers
that's my bias I'm generally a debunker
believer
if the last thing I saw was a debunk
probably going to believe it even if
there's a debunk to the debunk I'm very
biased toward the debunks but I'm also
aware of it right so at least I have a
little bit of caution about myself
because I know I'm biased toward the
debunks same way if somebody's accused
of a crime
don't you I think they're usually guilty
right not always plenty of innocent
people get accused of things but as soon
as you hear somebody's accused of a
crime and let's say they got indicted
you kind of think they're guilty most of
the time
so
let's talk some more about Rogue doctors
there was a fascinating
hypothesis by Julian Sanchez I saw this
on Twitter
and his basic idea is that the reason
that Rogue doctors are so
um accepted
by the public is because of movies
because if you watch a movie in which
there's a rogue anything a rogue doctor
Rogue lawyer Rogue whistleblower who is
always right at by the end of the movie
have you have you ever seen a movie
where there was a rogue doctor and then
at the end of the movie oh we just found
out the Rogue doctor was wrong about
everything
turns out the consensus was right all
along
well that's not a movie
you can't make a movie out of the Rogue
doctor being wrong
that doesn't work
so I've told you before that we're we're
so tuned to movies that that our reality
starts matching a three-act movie
I've been saying this for how long since
the beginning of the Trump era I've been
telling you that we're seeing things as
three acts maybe not by accident you
know some of it could be perceptual but
I think we're so primed that things have
to have three acts that we will force a
third act into an otherwise
normal situation like we'll just make
that third act happen the you know the
The Impossible problem that the hero has
to solve
and so uh Julian said she has this idea
is that since all movies uh make the
Rogue doctor the one that's right and
that human beings are essentially
programmed by movies and narrative
that The Narrative of the Rogue being
right is so strong in our fiction
and really even in our reality shows
because those ones that get picked to
make a real movie out of them
that's all we can say and if you can't
see past the movie filter
you'll be locked in the movie filter and
I was I would say that there are a whole
bunch of people from the claims of Q to
the claims of the Rogue doctors who
never got out of the movie frame
meaning they never really engaged with
science or so-called science or what we
think is science right that they they
just saw the movie for him and just
embraced it now there's there's some
thought that the Q Anon people
based on interviews were aware that it
wasn't real
do you think that's true
that the the some number not all of them
of course but there's some number of the
Q Anon people were completely aware
that it was all fiction
but it didn't matter
because they embraced it like they
embraced a movie you watch a movie and
it's sad and it makes you cry but it
wasn't real
you watch a movie and it makes you laugh
or makes you inspired but it probably
wasn't basically anything real
so we know the things that are not real
and that we know are not real
affect us like they're real
would it surprise you that some some
people would take Q Anon as just
entertainment and simply act as if it's
real and keep that act up because that's
part of the fun
I don't know
I I don't I'm not going to say that
that's most of the Q supporters but I
feel like it would describe some
some Maybe
just a hypothesis
all right
um
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on with monoclonal
antibodies
regeneron and REM deserveer
correct me if I'm wrong
but monoclonal antibodies went from the
best thing ever to we're going to remove
your emergency authorization at least
for most of them if not all of them
right now was that something that was
done to disadvantage Florida because
they had this good monoclonal antibody
thing going on
or is it because there was new
information showing that it didn't work
now when I say didn't work I mean in the
context of
um
uh the only agency tasked with
protection of whistleblowers is OSHA see
the issue here yes I do I didn't know
that interesting
um
oh
anyway so what I was going to say is
there are two versions of the story on
one version the government found out
that uh monoclonal antibodies don't work
against Omicron has anybody heard that
has anybody heard that monoclonal
antibodies don't work against Omicron
do you believe that
do you believe that
um
that the one thing let's say the
monoclonal antibodies do you believe
that the one thing that doesn't work
against Omicron and the other variants
is the only thing that doesn't work on
all your variants because the vaccines
do the therapeutic Therapeutics do
basically everything does right but this
is the only thing just the only drug
that's useless is against Omicron but it
was really great against the other
variants
really
really
now I know that that could technically
be true in other words on a scientific
basis that is totally possible
that it could be effective on one
variant and not another we'd all agree
with that right
but what are the odds that the only one
the only one that doesn't work on
Omicron is the one that DeSantis was
using in Florida to great effect
really
now that could be true which is you know
the sign of a good hoax could be true
but that is really really stretching my
skepticism
right yeah you know I saw Mike cernovich
tweet
suggesting the same suspicion that
they're there there's probably a
political filter on this that you don't
want Florida to look like they did
everything right
because DeSantis is probably a threat to
win the presidency
and
it's kind of sickening at the same time
REM deserver which can you do a fact
check on me I thought that early on we
knew that REM deserveer doesn't work and
that it causes more problems than it
fixes
and now it's being approved for
outpatient
even when we thought it worked we only
thought it worked for inpatient meaning
that you had to be pretty pretty bad
shape and actually hospitalized before
you could even see the signal of it
working
and then I think they decided it was
more more downside than upside
but now suddenly that thing that was
more downside than upside for the other
variants is just the thing you need for
Omicron
and the thing that fauci is most
associated with in terms of his uh
dealings and let's say connections
and maybe even past monetary flow
is that a coincidence that at this point
in the pandemic
miraculously monoclonal antibodies
stopped working at exactly the same time
the most damned medication in all of
in all of the pandemic meaning people
said the most bad things about it REM
deserveer about it not working and
hurting you more than it helps and then
suddenly that's good again
not only is it good
but it's so good you could use it in an
outpatient setting whereas before you
couldn't
really
I don't believe any of this
any of it it's beginning to look
like the government just stopped trying
to even pretend
to be on our side
Am I Wrong this doesn't even look
slightly Medical
I mean usually
even when the government is doing things
that look sketchy you say to yourself
well
I know I'm a little a little skeptical
but at least I see the reasons you know
the reasons are laid out so you know
maybe I don't agree with them but at
least there were reasons but I feel like
they just abandoned
anything except giving money to whoever
whatever pharmaceutical companies
bribing them best that's what it looks
like
I saw this uh data and I wonder if it's
true there's a new study I saw this in a
tweet by uh Anna cutsteel
that abercromb is clearly a game changer
in a large new study by researchers from
Berkeley and Kaiser Permanente just one
in 52 000 Omicron patients died
one out of 52 000. now what this study
did was I think it did a better job of
getting a random sample so instead of
just looking at people who are
hospitalized I think they looked at the
whole public
and said that one in 52 000 died
compared to fourteen thousand out of or
14 people and of seventeen thousand for
Delta
now if I told you that 14 out of
seventeen thousand have died of
something how worried would you be
14 out of 17 000 people died
how worried would you be
really you would be zero worried
so if you went to a stadium game let's
say the Super Bowl
and you knew that uh let's say Super
Bowl would be probably three times that
if you knew that 12 people were going to
die in the stadium while you watched the
Super Bowl you'd still go
would you
say let's say you thought there could be
50 000 people at the Super Bowl
but you knew in advance
twelve of them were going to die and
forget about the stampedes and the crowd
control forget about that you just knew
that in that Stadium 12 of you were
going to die before the end of the game
do you go to that game in person
I see a lot of yeses
yeah I don't know I mean it could be
that going to that game is safer than
driving your car
could be
but I've got a feeling that if 12 people
died in the stadium
we'd never have Stadium Sports again
it'd be like the last time anybody went
to a stadium
now
um you know we're all irrational with
big numbers we you know humans are not
good at handling percentages when when
they turn into these big numbers
but I would say that 152 000 would give
me exactly zero concern
but if a dozen people died in a
stadium-sized event I would be concerned
about that
somebody says bad analogy why is it a
bad analogy
all I'm doing is taking numbers and
deaths so you could take the analogy out
of it
but I did the reason I wanted to put you
in the scene you know imagine you're
going to the Super Bowl is I wanted to
actually imagine it like it's real like
you actually had to make the decision
all right well
those are the numbers
um
I provocatively tweeted this today why
why can't we have vitamin D passports
so we have passports if you have a
certain number of vaccinations
and there's talk about of course adding
natural immunity if you've been infected
before if you could prove it I guess
um and you know we'd like to see that
part of the protocol
but given that we know that high vitamin
D makes you virtually invulnerable
you know statistically speaking
if I had a vitamin D test that showed I
was in that high vitamin D category and
let's say I'm under a certain age
uh how about how about this why can't I
get a
effectively a vaccine passport with no
vaccination
as long as I had high vitamin D and I
could prove it I was at a certain age
you know I'm not 80 years old or
something I could prove them below a
certain age
my BMI is acceptable again I could prove
that I could have a test of my BMI
other comorbidities I suppose I could
prove that with a medical record
um
and then in the age of Omicron when you
know we're all going to get it anyway
and probably won't die
shouldn't that be a shouldn't that be
enough
I could prove every one of these I could
definitely measure my vitamin D my age
my BMI
and my medical records would show if I
had other comorbidities
are you telling me that in the age of
Omicron
right just specifically the age of
Omicron
when that's that's really all you're
going to get at this point is Omicron
in the age of omkron you tell me that
I'm not as safe as your
vaccinations
if I've got high vitamin D I'm below
let's say 65
perfect BMI
no other comorbidities that are
important really
you think that I have a lower chance of
dying with all this going for me
than you do with your fat ass
and 16 vaccinations
I say it's not even close
am I wrong
if you weigh 400 pounds and you're
vaccinated 17 times
do you think you have a better chance of
survival than I do with my vitamin D at
astronomic well I don't know I think
they're pretty sufficient
young enough low BMI
perfectly healthy
I don't think it's even close
so we're we're definitely not following
the science I mean it might be
impractical for somebody to measure all
these things but if you did measure them
I'm pretty sure my uh mortality risk
would be way lower than some vaccinated
people
you know what I mean you know what I
mean
all right here's a a an account that you
should follow if you don't remember what
I tell you now just look in my Twitter
feed because I just tweeted before I got
on here that you should follow this
account it is uh Jason The Germ guy
Tetro and he goes by at J A Tetro t-e-e
I'm sorry t-e-t-r-o
and
um every now and then you watch you
watch I'll call them whales everyone's
now every now and then a whale will
enter a conversation on Twitter and just
change everything
so uh Jason The Germ guide Tetro is a
whale
meaning that his his background on this
topic is the right kind of background
and he really really knows his and
he really really knows the research and
he really really can tell the difference
between good and bad
so watching this whale come into the
thread and just
I can use another analogy
it looked like raking leaves
you know sometimes you see the fight and
it looks like two pit bulls are kind of
a fair fight
because they both have an argument but
you know they seem about the same to you
well Jason comes into the thread I swear
to God it looked like he was just raking
leaves
hey there what's your argument oh here
we go
okay well what else anybody else have
this uh and you and a follow-up
and at each time he did it you did it
with a I think almost every time with a
link to some data that looked both new
and reasonable
so here but here are some things he said
uh I think he indicated and I may have
read it wrong
that if you were over 65 and you got at
least the earlier versions you know the
Delta whatever that your odds of uh
hospitalization were as high as nine
percent
does that sound right
he's a rogue scientist
now I he's actually not a rogue
scientist because I think most of his
takes are pretty close to the mainstream
but he defends it better
I I don't think it's that high is it
nine percent of people over 65 get
hospitalized with Delta
that doesn't seem right so I I'm just
gonna say I may have read that wrong so
don't blame don't blame Jason for that
data
because I think I think I was
interpreting it wrong I think that's on
me
um Adam Townsend made this observation
now a year ago but it's twice as true
today
do you remember that uh the videos of
the Wuhan where people were collapsing
in the street from the virus
and do you remember you thought to
yourself because I remember I did
I don't know if that's real or not but
it sure looks real or it looks real
enough
that I'm going to be scared about it
go back and look at it today
you've got a surprise coming you look at
it today
is obviously fake
it's obviously fake
you should see the guy falling the guy
standing straight up and then he starts
to fall like he's a tree and then just
before he hits the ground he puts his
arms out
who does that
if you're falling like a tree by the way
I've seen people fall like a tree
I I was at a event of for single people
a million years ago in San Francisco
and there was a Dilbert looking guy who
was just standing by the outdoor bar
just slamming drinks because he was too
nervous to talk to anybody
and I was I was stood there and watched
him actually stand straight up and fall
straight on his face on concrete without
breaking his phone
paramedics had to come I don't know if
he lived or died but
that's what it looks like when you when
you're unconscious right he was
unconscious before he hit the ground and
the ground didn't help his Consciousness
sending now you don't you don't fall
like you're not even going to use your
arms and then you wake up just before
the ground oh it looks like I'm two feet
from the ground I better do this
uh we we have become so much better
educated about the fakeness of
everything we see that if you look at
that 29 was it uh 2020 video if you look
at that early 2020 video
with the eyes of 2022 you will laugh at
how obviously fake it is you will laugh
and I swear I couldn't see it as clearly
when it happened
you're coming out of hypnosis
Yeah well yeah it was always sketchy but
it never looked so fake until until our
brains were more tuned to it today
um Rasmussen had some interesting polls
had to do laws requiring photo IDs
opposed discriminate against some voters
what do you think people said to that
what percentage of people thought that
voter IDs devote discriminates just take
a guess hey that was a really good guess
the people on locals wow you guys are
good guessers
everybody on locals got the right answer
that's amazing it's actually 26 but you
rounded it 25 yeah 25 percent
25 percent
25 percent
seems like exactly the number of idiots
who answer every poll that's right 25
percent of the idiots said yeah you
don't have a photo ID that would
discriminate against people who don't
know how to get photo ID I guess or
something
um about two-thirds were smart another
question rasmusseness was uh
do you agree with this the Congress
should pass a truly bipartisan election
Reform Bill to help restore confidence
in the elections
how many people thought
uh that it would be a bad idea
a bad idea to have true bipartisan
election reform how just approximately
God you guys are good you guys are good
wow it's like it's like a a psychic
convention here yeah yeah it turns out
it was you won't believe this but 24
percent
thought that bipartisan effort to fix
our elections
bad idea
25 percent
well
um here's an update on California masks
I updated understanding is that the mask
mandates that are in effect in
California were actually supposed to
time out
January 15th
so in theory if we don't do anything
two and a half weeks more and The Masks
will go away
um
I don't know if that's true and I think
we need to speed that up so I'd like to
see that still be February 1st
there are some maybe some motion
apparently the state supreme court in
New York New York State
uh decided that mass mandates were
unconstitutional
that's right
Aid a court has now ruled in New York
state
the mass mandates are unconstitutional
do you think anybody in California saw
that
do you think anybody in California is
going to say wait that worked
and they're already running to the court
with some kind of a petition or case or
something
um
so
that's happening
um now obviously we would expect a
higher Court even though it's just it's
the state supreme court but apparently
that's not the actual Supreme Court
there are courts above it that can that
can kill this rule or put a stay on it
which might happen but it does show that
there is uh certainly anti-mask movement
you know what else shows some anti-mask
movement I told this story on the locals
platform yesterday where I can give them
a little bit more detail than I can say
in public public
so I'll give you I'll give you on
YouTube the the more general statement
let's just say that yesterday I was in a
place that required masks
I'm not going to give you any detail
because I don't want to get anybody in
trouble
let's just say that in one large room of
which there were roughly 15 people
including me
as soon as the first two attractive
women removed their masks
everybody removed their masks
everybody
all it took was two attractive women to
go first because they never get in
trouble
you all know that right I'm not telling
you this for the first time
attractive women have no repercussions
if they do something that's socially
unacceptable
right now if if somebody like me does it
maybe an employee comes up and says put
it on
um you know it wasn't Christine in this
case but it would have worked with her
and I've been watching this phenomenon
the the pretty privilege and I just
haven't seen an attractive woman be
asked to put on a mask once once past
the door
um
I guess uh the Walmart in Quebec
has decided that you can't shop there
unless you have all your vaccines
and uh this could be a big problem
because if the Canadians start uh
illegally immigrating into America to
get away from
this Walmart policy and maybe shop at
our much more free Walmarts
um I think that Biden's gonna have to
send Kamala Harris there to see if they
can deal with a root problem
yeah Kamala Harris needs to go to Canada
and maybe stop this potential stem of
illegal immigrants across the northern
border
and uh maybe that maybe that'll help
um
let me let me test an idea with you
see if this seems mostly true right
nothing's 100 true but see if this
generalization sounds mostly true to you
number one
um two years ago
if somebody said follow the science what
did you think of that
maybe you thought that was common sense
maybe you thought that was a very
rational thing to do and probably yeah
totally reasonable
um in fact the person who said follow
the science was generally judged to be
the superior thinker
in the conversation right
two years later
when you hear follow the science are you
more likely to think it's serious or
sarcasm go
today if you hear it are you is your
first instinct it's serious or that it
might be sarcasm
or brainwashing
yeah the entire idea of follow the
science has been debunked
I I don't mean that you shouldn't follow
the science I'm saying that the public's
opinion of this has completely changed
and the pandemic did this the pandemic
made us see following the science as
absurd because here's what's happened
a lot of people followed the science and
where did they end up
so once they followed it where'd they go
they went to their team
some followed it to the Democrat side
some followed science to the Republican
side which ones were not following
science
nobody
nobody we were all following the science
as we saw it now sometimes that meant
you know disbelieving science that
seemed obviously not credible maybe
because it came through people who had
money or bad intentions
that's fair that's part of following the
science part of following the Sun
salty methods Scott got duped can you
give me a example of what I got
duped on anything
never mind you're gonna get blocked the
the people hallucinating that I got
fooled by something go read my profile
link you'll see my opinions what they
were and what they
um what they used to be and see if you
could find something that I got duped by
see if you could do that and then get
back to me
but if he can't find anything that I was
duped by next time you hear shut the
 up
all right
uh
does the Ukraine situation look to you
like uh
like our
deep state or somebody the industrial
military industrial complex
does it look to you
like somebody's Jenning up a fake War
for no for I don't know I guess monetary
use
the Ukraine situation just looks like a
fake War to me
I I don't see anything else there like I
can't even see it as legitimate a little
bit
you know during the uh weapons of mass
destruction phase of in Iraq I was I was
open to
the possibility they had weapons of mass
destruction but it seemed reasonable you
know at least you figured they'd at
least have you know illegal chemicals or
something
I was actually quite surprised that they
didn't but it's 2022 now
we're a lot smarter about this stuff now
at this point I don't have any belief
that the entire Ukraine thing is even
legitimate
like that we're even talking about a war
I don't now I'd like to believe that
we're just talking about it because
that's part of the process of preventing
it
that would be the most positive spin you
could put on it but it doesn't look like
it it looks exactly like we're being
somebody who's trying to Prime us for
war that we don't need that nobody needs
because somebody's got a profit motive
it looks like
now it could be not a profit movement if
it could be you know Chinese
Shenanigans or something I suppose
that's possible
do you remember pre-covet I I think
there's going to be a thing called
pre-covered thinking
meaning that before covid you could at
least imagine that the government wasn't
lying to you in some situations
right
pre-coveted you were at least open to
the possibility
that this time they weren't lying
sure there are other times they lied and
we know it but you were still open to
the possibility okay well this could be
true I mean I'm going to still be
skeptical I'm going to make them proves
okay but you know that could be true
what's your assumption now
isn't isn't your first assumption it's
not true
all right
now I don't agree with the people who
made the assumption that all of the
pharmaceutical products are bad
because we can't trust anybody
because that doesn't really track with
my sense of reality it's certainly
possible that three-quarters of them are
bad
if you said would you bet against that I
said no no I wouldn't bet against three
quarters of them being fraudulent but
it's kind of a stretch to imagine that
all of them are fraudulent
right that
maybe but I'm still not there that would
be a big
Big Stretch all right uh biggest story
of the day which will be uh immediately
ignored by the mainstream media
is there's a new book coming out by
Peter Schweizer
uh I guess it comes out right around now
and the book claims that the Biden
family earned 31 million from five deals
involving people with direct ties to
Chinese intelligence and this is being
called uh
uh Chinese Elite capture in other words
finding ways to bribe or influence the
elites
and I guess they thought that Biden was
connected enough to the elites that
controlling him would be good for China
so this book alleges and I haven't read
it yet but this is the the dues
that the Chinese Communists saw like a
big
big opportunity here and the hunter
Biden got meetings and major deals with
people associated with the Chinese
government
and that it clearly was just China
buying off the elites
now
I don't know how much of this could be
proven
so I I haven't seen the book so you're
gonna have to wait for the I would say
uh keep an open mind
and wait for any debunking of this book
but I'll bet you won't see any
I've got a feeling you won't be debunked
it will just be de-emphasized it would
just be disappeared it will be another
thing that only the people on the right
are ever aware of
and that won't change anything because
the people on the right already thought
that Biden was corrupt so this would
just add a number to it but it doesn't
change it and the people on the left
will just never see it they'll just
never see it
now what happens when the Peter Ducey
asks Joe Biden the question about it oh
there's a new book out that says blah
blah
what what what is Biden going to do he's
going to get that stupid smile of his
and call him a stupid son of a
all right let's get rid of this
one more Bites the Dust
anybody else
all right goodbye John Frank
um well to me it looks like China owns
the bidens
that's what I'd say what do you say
I think China owns the bidens
debunking implies some credibility well
that that sounds like pre-covered
thinking
in the old days
debunking did imply credibility
even if it wasn't there today I think
fact checking doesn't have any
credibility
maybe you shouldn't
so here's where everybody's trying to
dunk on me
if you if you said the government is
lying and you were right
that wasn't a surprise to me if you
thought it was
then I don't know that's mind reading or
maybe you haven't sampled enough of my
materials or something but I'm literally
the most distrusting person of authority
in
the planet I've spent 30 years talking
about almost nothing but that not
trusting Authority so I'm sorry
on locals one of the users to say that
they are actually the most skeptical
person well I'm the second most
skeptical person in the world after
after this person
Michael malice might be more distrusting
well we might be a tie
we might be a tie
huh ah
um have I read Atlas Shrugged yes did I
like it no I thought it was poorly
written
and had no impact on my political
thinking whatsoever I I really don't
understand how anybody is influenced by
Atlas Shrugged
it's not a good book
and I didn't get anything political out
of it
anything I mean I don't know how that
could influence anybody
yeah the idea of it I don't know I was
just an author with a bunch of opinions
it didn't do anything for me
huge Book for a guy that doesn't like to
read books well that's one of the
reasons I don't like to read books
you know I read that one because
everybody was talking about it
Shelly wrecked you
goodbye trolls
I heard that a lot of the Bots the
trolls and Bots are actually scripts
have you ever heard that there's a
there's a script
the sends sort of generic comments to
people like me
because I've been wondering why the
comments were so generic
like ever I was just showing somebody
yesterday every day I get a comment that
just says go yourself
or some version of it
and I think to myself was that really
based on what my tweet was
because it looks like they're just
randomly coming in with uh insults about
me and then they're about I don't know
there may be a dozen things that all the
trolls say about me it's just always
from the checklist the fact that it's so
checklist the their comments to me they
all look the same
uh looks pretty programmed
did you think War and Peace sucked too I
would never read War and Peace
Atlas Shrug is not for stupid people
it's probably true
uh the sound sucks right now I should
block you for that
all right well
um
what do you think is going to happen
oh
U.S facing massive shortage of
conspiracy theories as all of them have
come true
headline today
all right
um
Russian authors are tedious yeah
probably so all right that's all for now
YouTubers I'm gonna say goodbye and I'll
talk to you tomorrow
