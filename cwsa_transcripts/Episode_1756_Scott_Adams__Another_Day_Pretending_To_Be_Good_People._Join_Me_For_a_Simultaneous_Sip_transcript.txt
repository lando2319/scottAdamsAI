and welcome
to coffee with scott adams it's the
highlight of civilization
but i think you do that
and today
today we'll reach new highs new levels
of dopamine and oxytocin and
darn it
we're going to have a good time
no matter what craziness is happening in
the world and all you need to take it up
to another level is the simultaneous sip
and for that all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker shells
to stand a canteen joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the perplexingly profound professor
himself
somebody's calling me
i like it
wordplay
and now the simultaneous sip go
yeah you all look better now
i've got my coffee goggles on
i thought you were sexy before but now
oh
so
let's talk about some of the things that
have happened
elon musk was complaining that the word
billionaire is used as a pejorative
why is it an insult to be a billionaire
good question
and he asked this question on twitter a
twitter poll he said who do you trust
less
real question
billionaires or politicians
politicians 76 percent of them
of people answered said they trusted
politicians less than billionaires
but 24
said billionaires they would trust
even less than politicians
24
24
24 that's roughly a quarter
quarter rounds off to 25 to about 25
roughly
and if you're new to my live stream you
have no idea what that inside joke was
about
somebody will tell you
so
um i've told you before how my
news consumption is weird
because sometimes i'll be consuming the
news and then the news is about me
and i'll think okay that's weird
why am i consuming this news and it's
about me
so yesterday i'm reading twitter
and i'm looking over at the trending
trending terms and
there's my name
and i'm like oh
the last thing you want to do is trend
on twitter really it's like the
it doesn't mean something good you know
it always means something bad's
happening
so i was trending on twitter because of
a tweet or two i did
on bullies
and here's the weird thing that happened
i tweeted about bullies
being a problem
and it attracted all the bullies
so all the people would know no
awareness self-awareness whatsoever came
to seriously dump on me with obviously
the intention of making me feel bad
you could tell by the tweets
it was clearly their intention
to make me personally feel bad
who does that
i mean seriously
who who takes the time
just to make somebody feel bad
bullies right
so i was noticing there were there were
several distinct type of bullies
and so i started to catalog them a
little bit
i thought you would
enjoy it
and then i thought i would
uh it looks like i oh here we go
so the first type is the bullies so
these are trolls who just dropped by to
be toxic
they're they're not really disagreeing
so much
it's not really about what you said
they just dropped by to be toxic
and an example would be uh this actually
happened somebody tweeted when i saw
scott adams trending on twitter i was
hoping it meant he died
so somebody came to twitter to say in my
timeline
that they wish i had died
now
what causes that to happen to a person
like
what
what damage did they have in their life
that turned them into that
then the other type of trolls one of my
favorite groups is the soylent greens
i call them the soil and greens
because they always say whatever is the
most obvious thing one would say in
whatever situation
so if there's a tweet or a story about a
new food source
what do the soil in green say
it's soil and green
because it reminds them of the movie
it's the most obvious thing you would
say in every situation
when i do a tweet somebody doesn't like
the soylent greens come in and say
well i guess we just found out who was
the appointee here in boston gilbert
why did they say that
because it's the most obvious thing you
could say oh he's a cartoonist
he's saying something we don't like i
get it he's like a character in his
cartoon
sometimes they come in
and they refer to me as the creator of
garfield
it's almost as good
as the point here boss comment or
soylent green
sometimes they talk about the matrix
that movie but usually it's soil and
green
then you've got the bad reading
comprehension trolls they need to need a
better name for that
the the brcts bad reading corporations
they're the ones who
misinterpret what you said
and then they act really indignant and
insulting to their own hallucination of
what you said
so an example would be
so somebody's saying to me so you're
saying we should get babies hand
grenades
and then they will go off on what a bad
idea it is to give babies hand grenades
to which i'll say
uh
no i don't think i recommended hand
grenades to babies but you go do you so
those are the bad reading comprehension
trolls
then there are the keith's
this is based on the keith olbermann
personality the keys are the trolls who
ignore the content of the tweet entirely
and they're just there to insult you
that's it they just came to insult you
there they have no interest in the
actual content of the tweet
no no push back no no context no
argument
uh so those are the keys
and uh
then they're the holier than those
you've seen them right
the holier than those aren't going to
comment about you know the quality of
your tweet they're going to comment
about
the fact that you would even
mention such a topic as such a time
oh my god i'm holier than you and i
certainly wouldn't bring up this topic
now
i'm holier than you and i certainly
wouldn't be talking about this in public
because i'm holier than you and then now
so
those are the types and part of the
reason that i'm mentioning the types is
because i created a little guide that
i'm just going to cut and paste when the
trolls come by because i want my trolls
to spend a little time figuring out
which one they are
make them think best to sail a little
bit
because the sale is that you're a troll
and therefore should be ignored but if i
give them a list of what kind of troll
they are but don't specify which one
they are in the list
i'll make them do homework
to figure out what kind of a troll they
are
it's pretty good technique it's worked
so far um
so and some of some of the bullies on
twitter are actually reporting me to
twitter safety
fake reports
so the trolls are actually literally
literally trying to get me kicked off of
twitter by reporting me multiple times
for something that basically didn't
happen
and the troll shows it and the tweet
shows it didn't happen
so
uh
how did they throw you into talking
about trolls all morning well i think
the trolls are the only thing that's
interesting that's happening today
because the news unfortunately is just
repeat news
another horrible tragedy involving a gun
there's not much else new to say is
there
like we've sort of run out of things to
say if matthew mcconaughey
becomes a major part of a story
because of something he said about it
there's nothing left to say about the
story we should call that the matthew
mcconaughey rule
that says if you have to bring him into
the story
there's
there's just nothing left to say it's
still important i'm not saying you
minimize the story i'm just saying
there's nothing new to say
at all
so let's get some matthew mcconaughey
quotes in there
here's how cnn in an opinion piece uh
referred to this situation talk about
the shooting of course
it talked about the fact that there were
several people speaking out forcefully
against
against the tragedy i guess
and so here's how this was framed in an
opinion piece on cnn site
and yet steve kerr matthew mcconaughey
and beto o'rourke
all serve as courageous models
for a progressive capital w
white male identity that challenges
systems of oppression speaks truth to
power and confronts the division of our
current moment by publicly highlighting
the gap between the nation's professed
values and a more bitter reality that
allows 19 children to be killed in such
grotesque fashion
now if i'm looking at a story about an
hispanic
kid who at least that's his background i
guess
who killed a bunch of other kids
i'm not sure that the first place i
would have gone to understand it as a as
a framework for understanding it
is the fact that
three progressive white males
had weighed in
against the oppression of our systems
i feel as if that had nothing to do with
anything
what exactly
did the ethnicity and gender of these
three people have to do with anything
they're just three people who made a
little noise they just happen to be
three adult white males
but i don't think that's the important
part of the story is it
the important part of the story is that
three adult white males have the same
opinion on it
there's nothing here
but to but to try to
torture this story into some kind of a
racial story
you really have to push on that to make
it racial don't you you really got to
push on it but they did they pushed hard
here's some context also from cnn
and i'm not sure
how misleading this is
but it was something i didn't know
so i'm going to tell you this
from cnn i feel like there's some
context missing and maybe you can fill
it in
but here's their claim
that
are more gun deaths in texas by far
than in any other state
according to the cdc
and that where there are the most guns
ownership there is the most gun deaths
and apparently is really clearly
delineated
the more guns in the state
the more gun deaths now do you believe
that's first of all true
now we're talking only about percentages
so we're not talking about absolute
numbers absolute numbers are just based
on the size of the state basically so
not absolute numbers
but the percentage of gun deaths as a
percentage of say a hundred thousand
so here's what they say and again maybe
maybe the data is all wrong because
yeah so it's a per capita thing right so
here's what they claim
uh that
uh
the california by comparison to texas
has only 8.5 gun deaths per 100 000
where texas has over 14.
so that percentage-wise that's a really
big difference
and
texas has far more guns than california
and
less strict gun laws
so but they're not talking about the gun
laws in this case
this context is only about number of
guns so forget about the laws
just look like the number of guns
so according to
cnn and again this is not a credible
source can we agree on that
yeah i think you'll be less
your hair will be less on fire if i
agree with you
the cnn is not a credible source
unfortunately it's not
so i don't know if they're leaving out
any context or not
fewer gun laws okay thank you
for that correction
um
so they give the list of the here are
the states with the most guns
they also have the most gun deaths
so at the top is mississippi number two
louisiana
and going down list wyoming missouri
alabama and alaska
so they have by far the most gun deaths
and by far the most gun ownership
which is actually lower than i thought
if you are going to guess what
percentage of
adults
live in a household with a gun so so
only one person would have to have the
gun
and the other the other adults don't
even have to own the gun personally but
it's in the house what what percentage
of people live in a house
with a gun in it what did you think
the answer is around half
so it doesn't mean half of the people
have guns it means that half of the
people live in a house where at least
one person has a gun
which means that way fewer than half of
the people own a gun
right probably 25 own a gun something
like that
is that about right
so
does that track with what you thought it
would be i thought it would be higher
actually
i would have guessed
probably would have guessed i don't know
yeah maybe not much higher i probably
would have guessed 60
so i would have been pretty off
but not terribly i guess
so
um
what do you think of that
so the correlation according to this
article is very strong so they're not
talking about gun laws right we're not
talking about the laws
just the raw number of guns per hundred
thousand people
would do you believe
that the more guns the more the more gun
deaths do you believe that so forget
about why we're not talking about why
that's true
but just believe do you believe the raw
data
that where there are more guns there are
more gun deaths a lot of you say no
now you say no
here's why i think it might be true
because let me ask you this question
if you knew you were moving someplace
where a lot of people got shot
would you be more or less likely to buy
a gun for yourself
if you live in a place where people are
likely to be shot
do you buy more guns for yourself
yes right
don't you arm yourself more based on how
much danger there is
i would
is there somebody who would say there's
so many people getting shot here i
should get rid of my gun
does anybody do that
the the gun dangers here so much i
should get rid of my gun
some do i mean there are people all over
the board on everything right
but i think more often people are going
to say i think i need a gun if i'm going
to live in this place
don't you think
and then what happens
and then they also don't distinguish
what they mean by gun deaths
does a gun death include the police
ah
you don't know do you do gun deaths
include
the police shooting people in the in the
midst of a crime
probably
probably because they don't break it out
i mean the the article doesn't say we
don't count that
what about suicides
yeah
do you think that there are more guns in
places where people are more
likely to commit suicide
probably
probably whatever it is that makes you
have a lot of guns in a place
probably makes it not a good place to
live
right
so i live in a neighborhood that
probably has well that's not true my
neighborhood has a lot of hidden
republicans
a lot of people who
who talk to me silent you know
the whisper to me at the gym
i'll go to the gym and people will say
i love your show
i watch it every day
they actually can't say it out loud
where i live
people cannot say out loud
that they watch my live stream where i
live
they literally whisper it
[Laughter]
but there are a lot of them so a lot of
hidden republicans where i live
and
uh
i think we have low gun ownership
relative to other places
and i think the reason we have low gun
ownership is
not a lot of people get shot in my
neighborhood
i've never heard of one i've never heard
of anybody getting shot in my
neighborhood
my town yes
but not my neighborhood i don't know
maybe it's happened so i don't really i
think a lot of my neighbors would say
well we don't need a gun i live where
nobody gets shot
why would he need one
but if i moved to oakland
or somebody moved to oakland who did not
own a gun do you think they might
consider getting one
i think so so i wouldn't
i don't put too much credibility in
these numbers but they're definitely a
red flag
meaning that
if this is true
i think you'd have to take it seriously
i don't know if it's i don't know if
this number is telling us anything
useful but if it's useful
i wouldn't ignore it
now that doesn't mean you should give up
your gun rights
that's a different question
but you should know how much they cost
right though you want to know how much
your rights cost
give me a price tag
i want this right but here's the price
now
i'm willing to say out loud
that i think the second amendment is
worth the number of deaths
that gun ownership
probably
creates
i think it's worth it
because if you're only looking at the
number of people who are dying every
year
you're looking at the wrong thing
gun ownership also keeps russia from
attacking you
and trying to conquer you
right
i mean imagine
imagine anybody trying to conquer and
hold territory in the united states
with this level of gun ownership
i feel like it's just impossible
so
you have to look at you know what is the
expected value of future
reduction and risk
and then you'd have to bring that
forward to today and look at how many
people are dying today
and then you'd have to include the today
plus the future risk
and make it one decision if the only
thing you did is say
how can we stop gun deaths today i think
i would agree
i'd still need more information
but i would agree with the idea that if
you took away people's guns there'd
probably be fewer gun deaths
i don't think that's crazy
anyway do you and by the way let me be
clear
i'm pro-second amendment so don't take
anybody's guns away but
do you think if they did
there would be fewer gun deaths
i think so
i think so
i don't know i mean it's something you
could test
you could test it in one area and see if
it worked
it might be too hard to do now because
there's so many guns so nothing nothing
that you do now makes any difference
maybe there's just too many guns so i
think we've passed some point of no
return
i don't think you could reduce them at
this point in any practical way
all right well
anyway
uh let's talk about russian sanctions
so apparently the russian transportation
minister
said recently that the western sanctions
on russia have quote
practically broken all
logistic corridors
used by the country for trade so in
other words essentially there's just no
way for russia to trade with the outside
world at the moment
using their normal process it's
completely broken
which was the point of the sanctions but
they are they are looking at workarounds
so it doesn't mean that they're dead
just means that they're trying harder to
do workarounds
but
it does look like the sanctions have
teeth
wouldn't you say
it looks like the sanctions have teeth
maybe not enough but they seem pretty
toothy
there's a report that russia
is
taking on mothballs
tanks that are 50 years old
and moving them into ukraine to try to
hold the territory that they've already
conquered
now what does it tell you
that they have to take out of mothballs
of 50 year old tanks because you know
they don't want to use a 50 year old
tank
because they're very explodey they're
easy to easy to destroy
it's sort of like basically a death box
for the person in it
during war
so does that tell you
that russia is stretched thin and will
have trouble holding the captured
territory
because i always thought that the hard
part was keeping it
the hard part isn't isn't conquering yet
because they had enough bullets and guns
and bombs to essentially level the
entire place which is what they do
so there's no doubt that they could take
it
but i was asking the other day in the in
the age of drones the ukrainians will
have you know bigger and better and
smarter and more drones
every day they'll have more better
drones
at what point does it become impossible
for russia to hold territory
because if you need a tank
the tank is just going to go boom
because the tank is the easiest thing to
find
right because you're going to have
plenty of people on the ground who just
pick up the phone and say i'm standing
right next to a russian tank
can you send a drone over here and take
care of this thing
and that it will happen
right
and if they don't have tanks and they
don't have armored transports
how do they get their troops
back and forth from anywhere
i feel as if the troops would be so
vulnerable during a
what would you call an occupation
that in the age of drones you can't
occupy
anymore so this will be the test so let
me put that out there as a statement of
prediction
that
you can't occupy a modern
country
that has access to unlimited drones
they can't be done
so let's test it
i say it can't be done others would say
oh but the anti-drone technology is also
getting better they can just shoot their
anti-drone thing in the air and knock it
down yeah
but isn't there isn't there a number
you know isn't there a number of drones
that will conquer any drone defense
and can't we quite certainly get past
the number of drones and ukraine can
pass the number of drones
that can be stopped
you know drones are not unlimited of
course
but can we get to the number
that makes them a dominant force
i think it's just a matter of time
not in a year
not in a year but in three years
could ukraine have so many drones or
just you know blacking blackening the
sky over crimea
maybe
i think that's i think a swarm defense
or a swarm offense especially would be
uh pretty powerful
now i imagine that there will be the
invention of something called
uh
drone hunter killer drones probably
already exist
they must already exist right wouldn't
the the best drone defense
be your own drones
no that's not good because then you
can't use your anti-drone technology
if you were jamming drones you'd be
jamming your own drones
so see i guess you can't use drones
against drones too much
because you can't use the jamming then
uh drone catchers yeah
they have all that technology
all right
cnn is saying that that school shooter
was a bullied loner
and then i saw one interview with a
classmate who said oh they're getting
wrong he's not a bullied loner he's
actually he was a psychopath
and he was the bully
he was the one who her animals said his
classmate
and that he was clearly just the
deranged bully bad seed
but cnn is reporting it differently
calling him a bullied loner
i would say that that is fog of war
reporting we don't really know about
this guy yet
but
don't you think that uh bullied people
become bullies
pretty much always
if you get bullied
it kind of turns you into one right do
you think this kid might have been
bullied or
abused when he was a child in some
context
we don't hear about his father so we
don't know what the deal is there but do
you think he was ever bullied or abused
i'm going to say probably
probably
not an excuse
not an excuse
but probably
now apparently uh israel has much better
experience guarding their schools
what is it that israel does to guard
their schools that we don't
does anybody know
what do
uh they have they have armed guards
yeah locked doors so the first part is
they have physical security
but the claim uh from an article by i
guess david hosney
was was saying that their success is not
so much that they have armed guards i
think they do
but it's their uh
their intelligence
meaning the information that they have
about their public
so apparently they can identify the
shooters before they shoot
you don't think we can do that too
you don't think that artificial
intelligence could identify
a
a loner who had no friends and was
interested in firearms
do you think you could find a teenage
male
who didn't have friends
said violent things on social media and
had an unusual interest in firearms of a
certain type
of course it could
of course it could
there's there's no way
you could convince me that we can't
identify these people ahead of time
because they all post on social media
every one of them
i don't know if you'll ever see a mass
shooter who doesn't have a social media
account
i'll bet you won't there's there's a
prediction for you
there won't be another mass killer
who doesn't have social media unless
it's for political purposes if it's
politics or real terrorism that's
different
but but one of these standard school
shooter situations
where they're trying to be famous
you know
christ church somebody says to
christchurch did he not have
social media is that what you're saying
he did i thought he did
all right
if you ever lived in texas you would
understand that
physical security will not work
i agree with that
physical security will have a limit
because
let's say you have one guard
at a door
and there are lots of things behind that
door
don't you just shoot the guard first
because the guard doesn't see it coming
right
you just walk up to the guard like every
other kid take your weapon out bam the
guard is dead first
i'm not sure the guard would make any
difference
now if you had multiple guards maybe the
other ones could get there faster etc
but um but there's a real limit at what
you can do with armed guards it's better
than nothing
and i don't think there had been a
school shooter where there was an armed
guard at the very door that they went
through
i don't know that that's happened
you know
so i would i would say that probably the
future whether you like it or not
is
profiling
so
if it works in israel
and
we can't do nothing
we're going to do that
ai can detect a breach to the perimeter
maybe
um
then apparently
the school children are taught to stay
in place
do you think this staying in place is
the best strategy if there's an active
shooter
what do you think i'm no expert on this
but it seems
because you can imagine
i think it imagines entire it depends
entirely upon how quickly help is coming
doesn't it
if there's no help coming like right
away
i'd run
but if there's help coming in five
minutes i might i might try to
you know last behind the locked door
wouldn't you say
yeah so i don't know i don't know i i
think every situation is different so
you'd have to know the specifics
but um
so we still have this question of the
police allegedly
forming a perimeter and not going in to
stop the shooter
i would warn you that we're still in fog
of war on this situation
i suspect that we're going to find out
something
about what the police knew or didn't
know
that will change your analysis of
whether they were all incompetent
horrible people who should have gone in
but didn't
now maybe we'll find out it's exactly
what it looks like
they didn't want to risk their own lives
maybe
but maybe
there's more to the story
i saw a
post from somebody who is a lead swat
team officer
now this is somebody who can speak to
this situation with some experience
which i can't
and the swat team officer said that all
the people commenting on twitter
about the police who didn't go in
have never had anybody shoot at them
before
and the swat team says swat team guy
says
until you've had people shooting at you
you really shouldn't be the one to judge
them about going in
to which i say
you know what if that didn't come from a
swat team lead
i might not take it so seriously
but i'm taking it seriously
and i'm going to say this
do you think that the swat teams have
the same training as an um a general
police officer who would be guarding a
school
or let me ask it in a less kind way
do you think that the school guards are
the best and the brightest of the police
or law enforcement organizations
do you think they take their good people
and good as you know in quotes
do you think they take their best
performers
and have them guard schools
or do they say hey you'd be good for the
swat team
now remember that even the guy who is
the lead of the swat team
is very aware that once the bullets are
flying
it's hard to get anybody to go into a
room
do you think that the people who are
guarding schools had the right training
and that were the right type of people
to
blaze into a gunfight
the swat team people are
trained to do it they're they're
selected based on their you know
presumed ability to do it so i would
guess that a swat team
person somebody with that training
would have gone in
or would have known not to i suppose
there are two possibilities would have
known better or would have gone in
but i don't think there were any swat
team trained police officers were they
and you know it's easy for us to all say
oh we would have gone in
if you put me in that situation i would
have gone in
and i actually think that
i think that
exactly i think that
if if i thought kids were being
slaughtered
i would risk my life to stop it
except
i've never been shot at
i don't know what that feels like
to the point of the you know the
head of the swat team i don't know what
that feels like
what does my body do
when a bullet zings past my head and i
know that if i open that door there's
going to be a lot more of them
what does your body do
because i don't know if my body can move
do you
i mean you don't know until you do it
right until you're in that situation do
you really know
because i feel like you know when i
imagine it i'm all brave
like when i'm like oh i'm not going to
let them kill the kids on my watch i'll
run in there with my gun blazing and
do what has to be done
but would i
would i
would i
i'd like to think i would
but you don't know
you don't know
until you're in the situation
right i like to think that if i'd been
trained
probably yes
if i'm not trained for that kind of
situation
i don't know
honestly
somebody said a parent would and i'm
going to give you that as a stipulated
truth
somebody who was a parent
or even not not even a parent of those
kids but they were just actively a
parent of the same age probably would go
in
because they would just see their own
kid and they would just go in you know i
mean in their mind they would see their
kid even if even if their kid wasn't
there so i would agree with you if you
were actually a parent of kids that age
your brain would just say go
probably
all right but i'm just saying have a
little bit of understanding
that humans still are humans
they don't do supernatural things
so when we judge these people keep that
in mind
i don't mind that you have a harsh
judgment of them because they do have
those jobs i mean if that's literally
your job you've got a lot of explaining
to do if you're not doing it
there's some polls from rasmussen
yesterday's poll that said
there's a huge gap in
voter excitement so republicans are far
more excited about voting in the
congressional midterms like a lot
so there's a a point
like excitement gap
which
should
suggest that republicans will do well
but
as of today also from rasmussen
it turns out that the that generic
ballot thing where they say how would a
generic republican do in the midterms
against a generic democrat
and then they say well it looks like the
generic republican would beat them by
nine points or whatever because that's
what it was it was a nine point
difference that the republican had an
advantage in a hypothetical match
that went down to six
uh almost entirely because of
independents
who were
plus 18 for republicans and now they're
only plus 11. so basically the the news
about the shooting i think
just stripped off a bunch of
independents
so
here we were
coasting into the election season with
republicans just going to win everything
one guy with a ar
has completely changed the polling
numbers
just one
one idiot with a gun and
changed the entire structure of the
united states
that just happened
one guy with a gun
just changed politics in the united
states
in a substantial way
in a way that could change you know how
we act for years
uh
so that's kind of scary
it does show you that anything can
happen so
uh there's nothing about the midterm
elections that's
predictable
except that you can't predict it
all right
um
i believe that's all i had to say
so
the bullies are after me today you might
see that i
pasted a
little statement of the troll types
so if you run any into any of the types
of trolls
you can paste that in and let them think
about which kind they are
thank you
all right
what is it
some local police officers enter the
school to rescue their own children
god this story just gets uglier and
uglier doesn't it
all right
so i wouldn't think that the generic
vote thing tells you as much as you as
you think it does because people still
end up voting for their party for the
most part
uh
response was ugly yeah
uh could not claim about current what
number of innocent lives lost in large
enough population should be ignored
i know i think
yeah stop publishing their names and the
problem will stop i don't think so
i used to think that if you didn't
publish their names you would get less
of it but i think that's simplistic
because i think the the the people doing
it know that they'll be famous
even for the event
so i don't think it's the actual
remember your name part that matters to
them i think it's just doing something
that's my guess so i don't think
changing the name makes a difference i i
personally am not going to mention their
names
because i don't like giving them any
any presumed benefit at all but i think
it's the smallest
part of it
um
that's interesting over on locals
somebody's saying we should show their
we should show their faces because
usually their face doesn't believe in it
so if you show the uh the shooter
shot
to death
maybe that would make a difference
the suicidal will not care if they die
yeah yeah once they're suicidal i guess
that's by definition
did the
buffalo coverage trigger the other guy
certainly
certainly
do you think there's any any chance that
the
the news coverage about the other
buffalo shooter
you don't think that that
encouraged this year of course it did of
course
yeah you only do the things you can
imagine
that's all you have to know
people only do things they imagine
if
if the only news had been about
stabbings
probably there'd be more stabbings
because that's what you can imagine you
imagine what you've heard of
all right
um
former fbi agent was chatting online
with the buffalo shooter
okay
um
there's not much more to say about these
shootings so i feel like i'm not going
to
although probably it seems like every
day there's a new
new reason to talk about it
all right is there anything i forgot
that you need to hear about
no i think that all shooters are
influenced by all shooters i don't think
has to do with who's a white supremacist
and who's not
i think just the action is enough to
trigger people
uh oh yeah
so jack dorsey left the board of twitter
and uh elon musk's tweet about it was
jack off the board
jack off the board
uh
a symptomatic okay that's pretty good
somebody got monkey box but they're
asymptomatic
wordplay
um
feels like we never got the real story
about the vegas shooter
yeah
but i think the real story had to do
with something in the vegas shooter's
head i don't i don't think there's
anything beyond that
keep talking scott kids have to wait
until you're done
all right well i do think we're done
here and
uh
oh do you think that bedo interrupting
the press conference was a win for
democrats yes i do
i do
i think that
it was actually probably a successful
political stunt
because he was playing to the base right
oh yeah i forgot to mention that
how did i forget to mention that
that was definitely in my notes
that they saudi arabia has figured out
how to get a
rare
earth mineral out of the ocean
at an economical
rate
i thought i wrote that one down
but
so i think it's the lithium for
batteries
so the the rare earth minerals are not
rare in the sense that they're only in
some places they're actually spread all
over everything it's just that it's so
such trace amounts
that is hard to collect at all
economically so they figured out how
somehow how to get it out of the ocean
and to get it economically they say
now
uh yeah so they're not rare
they're just hard to harvest
and when you do harvest them it's bad
for the environment often if you use the
older techniques
and so that's part of the reason that
china can do it we can't they don't have
the same environmental restrictions
so i do think that modern technology
will probably find us ways to get these
rare earth minerals
better and cheaper wherever they are
so i don't think we're going to have to
depend on other countries after a while
oh yes and then also
japan has decided to
reopen all of their closed nuclear
reactors
all of them
so you could not have a stronger
statement
in favor of
nuclear energy then japan opening all of
their closed nuclear plants
that should be the beginning and the end
of the entire conversation like if you
knew that
now we do
uh
then i think that means something
all right
you know about diablo diablo is coming
back online right
lithium is not a rare earth mineral i'm
being told
all right i gotta run
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
