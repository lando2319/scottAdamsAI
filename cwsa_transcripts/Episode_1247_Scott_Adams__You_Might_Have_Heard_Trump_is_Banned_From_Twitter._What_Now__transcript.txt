hey everybody
come on in come on you may have heard
that there's some news thank goodness
we've gotten past
the holiday season and the news is
plentiful and interesting and we can be
entertained
once again um i don't know how long i
will be
still a platform coming to you at the
moment on both the periscope and
youtube platform simultaneously
but how long will i still have the
ability
to be platformed probably not very long
um but let's see if we can get through
today
and in order to enjoy this to its
maximum potential all you need is a
copper mug or glass of tanker telstra
steined a canteen jugger flashcard
vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope immediate of the
day the thing that makes everything
better
it's called the simultaneous
oh it seems that the uh there's some
complaints from youtube
let's see what we can do about that
youtube are you happy that should make
it better
all right um
you know i own some twitter stock full
disclosure
but i don't know if it's going to go
down that much on monday i hear a lot of
people saying that
but what exactly is the other twitter
service you're going to use
parlor and gab are probably going to be
taken down by
apple and the apple store and google pay
i think gab is already taken down
so
let's try this again with sound
okay all you need is a copper marker
glass tanker tells us to sign a canteen
jericho flask
all right well the good news is i've
ordered an adapter
so this problem where i can't be
charging my ipad at the same time the
microphone is
plugged in should be solved by this
afternoon
yeah it was the best zip ever you're
right it was the best set ever
let's talk about the news not coffee
well you all know that
twitter has banned trump for eternity
from twitter now
it's hard to imagine what that meeting
was like
i don't know if it was a physical
meeting or a zoo meeting but don't you
think
twitter had some kind of a management
meeting
to decide whether trump should be banned
forever
now i think that the uh the
justification is that he might have been
in their opinion fomenting some kind of
you know uh trouble
but how did they do the calculation
because leaving trump on there to say
things
you could assess that you know with some
risk you could say okay
the things he says might cause more
things like the
attack on the capital so you don't want
to have that risk
so you can reduce it by taking them off
the platform
but isn't there an offsetting risk
i mean isn't there a risk of actual
civil war
how do you weigh those so let's say that
uh
taking trump off the platform if you
were just going to go through the math
of it
let's say that you believed it would be
a 50
likelihood to reduce
20 deaths because there might be more
unrest
let's say 20 people might be killed by
the time all the unrest is done
if trump were allowed to stay on the
platform and said things that got people
fired up maybe a 50
chance of 10 people dying now the way
you would calculate that is you'd say
a 50 chance of 10 people dying
just for analysis purpose purposes you
treat it as
10 people so 50 chance of 20 people
dying
you'll you'll weigh that as the value of
10 people it's not really 10 people this
is just how you do the
analysis and then you say okay but what
about the other way where you take him
down
and you anger 71 million people who feel
that they've lost
everything that that makes the country
the country
freedom of speech freedom basically the
the freedom to have an opinion and not
be punished for it
what is the risk of that well i would
say the risk of that is full civil war
wouldn't you like actual civil war not
the kind where some people are
protesting and
saying things and things like that but
if you shut down the ability to
communicate
or it even feels like you did because
trump's such a big part of that
communication
what would be the expected risk
now i think the risk of an actual
physical civil war is low
but what is low five percent
let's put a number on it let's say five
percent
is that fair do you think that uh
shutting
shutting down trump from twitter
gives you a five percent chance of civil
war that didn't exist before
is that too much so let's say five
percent of civil war what is what would
be the expected risk or number of people
who might die in an actual civil war
let's say a million you know you know
you'd be guessing right
let's say a million people could die in
the civil war
so you take five percent of a million
and you compare it to 50 of 20
and you'd say which is bigger five
percent of a million
it's a lot bigger so if i were in that
meeting
and somebody said we're trying to reduce
the risk to the country
and let's say it was a let's say it was
entirely non-political and it just had
to do with safety
or safety plus the you know the future
of
twitter which would be similar you know
if they don't if they don't protect
safety they're gonna have to pay for
that too so
if i were in the meeting i would say it
looks like you're taking a 50
chance of 20 people dying 10 people
comparing it to what 50 000 people dying
the other way
so you've saved 10 at the cost of 50
000. now remember we're only talking
statistics
so that 50 000 is very unlikely
because it's unlikely there would be a
civil war but what if it's a 5
that's how you do the analysis if it's a
5
chance more of civil war you don't do
that
if you know how to make decisions so i
asked on twitter
um ironically whether this would be
viewed as one of the biggest mistakes
in american history and it could
you know it's in that five percent range
but it could be one of the biggest
mistakes in american history
actually now we don't know where it's
heading yet
but in terms of its potential
it's potentially one of the biggest
mistakes in all of human
well american history not human history
so one wonders were there other
considerations
in other words if it were just a
business decision
and it were just based on saving the
most people
is that the way you'd go because it
looks like exactly the opposite of what
you would do if you wanted to save lives
or at least reduce risk now it could be
that
if if you know 10 people died tomorrow
because of something trump did
that would look like twitter is directly
responsible why didn't you do it sooner
so 10 people dying that can be blamed on
you specifically
you might take that more seriously than
50 000 people dying
that maybe doesn't get blamed on you
specifically you know what i mean
so it could be that it has to do with
how
blame would be attributed and we'll talk
about
that a little bit more so i asked on
twitter everything sort of meta today
but i did a twitter poll which of course
are highly unscientific they're
just sort of interesting and i ask
people who do they think is most
responsible for the capital protests
now when i said that i think most people
understood that to mean
you know with the violence not just the
peaceful part
but who is most responsible for the
protests which led to violence
and the responders i gave them four
choices
you could argue that there should be
more choices but i said would it be
trump
the fake news social media or congress
now of course my twitter followers
lean pro-trump but here's what they said
they said 13 said trump is most
responsible
for the capital problems 46
said the fake news uh 13
social media about the same as trump and
congress got 29.
so by far the two entities which are
blamed the most for the capital of
protest
are the fake news and social media and
social media of course
is a a booster of fake news and a
creator of fake news
so here's how i see the world yeah
there's a white board
yeah didn't see this coming did you bam
whiteboard time coming right at you
all right here's how i see the world
there is a blame
chain which is to say it's not that one
person had to do
what they did in order to get the result
we got it had to be way more than one
person
you had to have everything that was a
part of the causal chain had to be just
the way it was
to get just the result you got if you
change
any of those elements you get a
different outcome
but let's say you tried to apply that
thinking to
a murderer and you say wait wait it's
not the murderer's fault
because all of the other things had to
be in place before that murder could
happen
the victim had to be there well that's
not the murderer's fault right so it
doesn't make any sense for
a criminal situation because when it
comes to crime you need a specific
criminal to punish so the society can
see people getting punished and so
there's a
reason not to do the crime but in the
criminal situation
you're really just looking at stopping
crime you're not
philosophically asking well who is
really responsible
could it be the parents of the criminal
could it be society or the way they
learn things
could it be that they were bullied in
school those could all be a hundred
percent true
and they could be a hundred percent the
cause but in the legal world you just
say
it's just got to be the person who'd
pulled the trigger
right so let's agree that an analysis
about the legal system
and who's to blame would be unique
and you would you would ignore a lot of
reality because you have to
for the legal system but let's say
you're just saying
in general whose fault is it i'm not
putting anybody in jail
it's not the court it's just we're
talking
and we're going to say who actually
should take the blame
and here's how i see it you've got a
fake news business which gave us the
fine people hoax
the drinking bleak chokes and uh
non-stop bias
you could say that it was on both sides
you could say that right was biased and
fake news but it's just different fake
news
and i won't argue with you on that my
only point is
what would thing what would things look
like if we had
a reliable and credible free press
well when the election happened the free
press would have done two things
if they were like a real free press they
would have dug into each of the
allegations
they would have created a master list
and said here are the allegations
here are the people debunking it and
hear the ones
that you were judged in court one way or
the other and every citizen would be
able to look at that and say oh
okay i was quite concerned about the
integrity of the election
but now i see that the free press has
done the work for me they've
investigated
they got other experts they've debunked
and maybe they debunked them all
what what would be the outcome if a
credible press both the left and the
right
looked into it compiled a complete list
considered every
claim and debunked it all with experts
not themselves
what would have been the outcome well
not a riot
right why would you riot if you knew
that your side lost fair and square
you wouldn't you'd say damn it got to
try harder next time we lost fair and
square
so i would say that the fake news is 100
responsible for the outcome they created
this situation
in which they took themselves out of the
equation as a credible player
and probably only made things worse i
mean you could point to
elements of the press that promoted
ridiculous conspiracy
theories on the right primarily so
how does the press not get blamed for
this outcome well the reason is
that the press's influence is harder to
trace down to any individual person
what about social media social media is
kind of a booster of the fake news
that's full of hoaxes and conspiracies
theories
the algorithms divide us so that there's
natural division that's worse than it
would be normally without
it so it's divided the country now once
you've divided the country
and people are just going to take sides
because that's what social media did to
us
what happens when there's any
disagreement
does the disagreement get resolved in a
reasonable way where people go i don't
love it but i'll compromise
for the good of the system and stuff
like that no no you can't
get that you can't get a
a negotiated agreement where everybody
goes away and goes ah it wasn't perfect
but we can we can live with it
you can't get that if the social media
is dividing the country
people just go to camps and they think
that's where they need to be
so they've been brainwashed into this
division
through the algorithms and and also the
social media allows
protests to organize so if you didn't
have social media
i doubt you could have been as organized
as they were to to get people there so
that's part of it
so i'd say social media probably uh if
you
removed social media would the
uh riots have happened i feel you could
make a strong case
really strong that without social media
doing what it does
intentionally and unintentionally you
wouldn't have the riots
so are they responsible if if they
didn't do what they were doing it
wouldn't have happened
so are they to play well the answer is
they have a hundred percent
responsibility at the same time that the
fake news has a hundred percent
because if they didn't do what they were
doing probably we wouldn't have had this
outcome now let's take
congress and state governments they gave
us a non-transparent election
with lots of last-minute changes and
they resisted audits
does this situation pretty much
guarantee
the sooner or later you can have a
election related riot
it does it guarantees it now it wouldn't
necessarily guarantee it
if you didn't also have social media
dividing the country
and the fake news you know doing the
same really
so is congress and the state governments
collectively are they
responsible for the riots yes what
percentage of responsibility would i
give them
a hundred percent because if they'd done
their job and given us transparent
elections
or let us audit them or not made last
minute changes which
destroyed the credibility of the system
if they had not done these things
we wouldn't have had protests so
100 blame social media 100
blame fake news 100
blame any one of them could have done a
good job
or a different job and gotten a
different outcome
but they didn't they didn't so what
about
trump's calls to protest the language he
used
was it responsible for
the bloodshed yes
yes it was because trump easily could
have done something else
he could have said look absolutely no
violence i don't want to see anything
like that
if you come to the to dc make sure
you're in the
you know you're in the safe zones don't
bring any lead pipes
he could have said that but he didn't
and so i back i backed his removal from
office
because that was a pretty big mistake
but
i do not back trump's removal from
office
without an equal amount of punishment
for the other entities
which have equal responsibility now
again
the way our legal system is organized
and the way we're all trained
is that the last person who does
something is the guilty one
and if it were a legal case or a lawsuit
yeah that's the way we treat it
you have to because there's no practical
way to treat it any other way
you wouldn't really know what to do with
these other entities it's too
too hard to trace the influence but you
know it's there
so here's my take should trump be
removed from office
for this specific infraction which
probably did lead to some deaths i'd say
yes
and i think it's an easy call because he
only has a few days left in office and
what was he going to do anyway
right and if you're going to send a
message
to say presidents should not act this
way
you know to drum up any kind of attack
on the capitol
you could argue that his exact words
never said anything like that and you'd
be right
there was nothing in his exact words
that told anybody to do anything violent
but you know he could have played it
differently right
it's not what he said that was a problem
in my opinion he didn't say anything
that was a problem
it's what he didn't say it's what he
could have said
easily knew that he could have said so i
think that
accepting responsibility for that is
fair if you will
also let him accept uh credit
for things he did in his presidency
which i think were unparalleled
and incredible but can't you hold both
thoughts can't you say he was really
good at this
this part not so good that's fair
right is there anybody who can't hold
those two thoughts
you probably shouldn't follow me if you
can't
all right so here's my take the
scariest part about this system i just
described
is that social media and the fake news
more the fake news working through the
social media they're the ones who can
assign
blame so we have a system
that if if you had designed the system
from scratch
people would laugh at you they would
laugh at you
all right let me describe the system as
if i were designing it from scratch
all right we're gonna i'm gonna build a
system so we'll have something called
the free press and we'll have this thing
called the government and
there'll be a public and this is how
they'll all work together
now there's there's one bug in the
system i gotta admit
and it is that one of the entities
can cause the problems in society
and they're the only ones who can
distribute the blame
and i'd say hold on i probably heard
that wrong are you saying you're
intentionally designing a system where
the people who are the main cause of all
of our problems
are also the only ones who can assign
the blame
and the person say yeah yeah that's
that's what we're doing i go hold on
wait a minute
do you not see a problem here you just
said that the ones who caused the
problems
let's say the fake news you're saying
they also get to blame other people for
the problems that they caused
right in front of you yeah that's the
system
what would you do if somebody presented
you with that that system
you'd laugh you would literally laugh
he's like well that's not going to work
because obviously the people causing the
problems are gonna blame other people
like trump now trump made it easy he
made it easy to blame because
he didn't play it right so that's you
know that's the problem with being a
politician if you make it easy
they're gonna come they're gonna come
for you so
this is a completely unworkable system
for the long run
i don't know exactly
i don't know exactly what we're going to
do to fix this
but i do expect there will be enough
ingenuity and enough a b
testing and enough free market stuff and
enough
energy to probably find some
alternatives it's just not obvious what
they're going to be
now the the public is quite good
at solving things eventually
we're pretty good problem solvers but i
gotta say it's not
obvious to me what you do about any of
this because
right right now you see uh trump losing
his effectively his freedom of speech by
being de-platformed
from twitter but
these other entities i don't think
they're gonna lose their freedom of
speech
are they because they got to blame other
people so as long as the
the fake news can just make stuff up
what are you going to do let me suggest
a possibility
i'm just going to brainstorm right now
we watched
trump get kicked off not just for
inciting violence
but i think they would have kicked them
off anyway for making election claims
that social media says are not true but
you know what
social media also needs to do a little
bit better job on the fake news
because for example these hoaxes the
fine people hoax the drinking bleach
oaks
those were allowed to spread what do you
think did more damage
to the country the fine people hoax
or trump telling people to
protest in dc which led to the violence
which which do you think
hurt the country more i don't think it's
close
i think the fine people hoax is one of
the most damaging things
that's ever happened um i'm not even
close
it's maybe a thousand one you know you i
wouldn't compare them
as as horrible and tragic as it is for
five people
to die and all those people being
injured completely unacceptable on every
level
but to find people hoaxes worse by maybe
a thousand times worse it's not even
close
to what it did to this country but
social media allows that to stand
now that's an obvious lie you just look
at the transcript
oh obvious lie why is that allowed to
stay
could it be that the real way to solve
this is to put pressure on social media
to wait for it
wait for it use their own standards
because that's a pretty strong argument
isn't it hey social media
we'd like you to use your own rules just
use them consistently
and i think we would need to pick a few
items let's say
we being anybody who's concerned about
the issue pick a few items and just
just diet die on that hill
just say look as long as you're allowing
people to say that the find people hoax
is a real thing and that you can just
say that
on social media with no repercussions
just pick one thing and say
you you need to be regulated or shut
down if you can't
treat these the same right now
wouldn't you think there's a question
would
would it be possible to do a lawsuit in
which you just pointed out this
difference
and said that it's two classes of people
being treated differently by
the same company is that is that legal
one class of people being republicans
let's say the other
part being non-republicans could a
social media company treat them
completely differently
when their policy says their own policy
says
they don't their policy doesn't say
anything about republicans and democrats
it just says
you know information that's terribly
wrong and might be dangerous to the
country they're going to
ban what if i agree with that
what if conservatives said hey i like
this
what if conservatives embraced it and
said
absolutely here's our list of other
things you should ban on your platform
and let's just go for it let's do it
consistently let's do it once
let's do it right let's let's get rid of
the following lies
now probably it would be good to have a
list of maybe five
good lies like the five top lies that
social media allows
and you pick the ones that are the most
damaging
the ones that literally you can say okay
that probably killed somebody
for example when the fake media said
that
president trump was suggesting drinking
bleach
which never happened or anything like it
not nothing similar nothing in that cat
nothing like it
and if you if you still think that
happened you need to you need to read up
on it
but what happens when uh the fake media
says your president
is so unscientific and dumb that
uh he said drink bleach which never
happened
what does that do to people's compliance
when the president says maybe you should
wear masks
he was a little reluctant but you know
when he got there
do people say uh yeah i'm gonna listen
to the guy who said drink bleach
no no they they discredited
trump so anything useful he might have
said and he did eventually say wear
masks
didn't have any effect because he's the
drink bleaching guy according to the
media
so you can easily i think find strong
arguments that say
that the two sides are being treated
unequally
and maybe the supreme court would hear
that
now i'm not a lawyer is that a case can
somebody who actually knows anything
about the law which would not
be me tell me could you bring a case
about unequal treatment when it's so
obvious
this is the most obvious case you could
ever see there's no jury in the world
who would disagree that they're making
up you know they're making up stuff
and publishing it like it's true
all right so maybe that's the way to go
um
as we're learning more about the
protests themselves
and i have to admit i was taking a
little bit of a humorous
uh approach to it because there was a
guy in a viking helmet and
blah blah blah but when you hear the
details there were apparently
members of that group with lead pipes
and it was probably the lead pipes on
the head
that injured the cops and at least one
died
and let me say this as clearly as
possible anybody who had a lead pipe
and used it uh in this situation should
be the death penalty
um you know normally maybe not if it was
like a fight or something
but if you're trying to overthrow the
government
you know if you attack the government
with lead pipes
the government in this case including
the security force
i don't even know if that's jail that
should be execution
shouldn't it if you get all the way into
the capitol building and start
killing people with a deadly weapon
that should be death sentence i'd be
okay with that
as opposed to all the peaceful
protesters of course not
there's a uh some fake news going around
on a video i've told you that video is
the biggest liar
we used to think if you saw it on video
you saw it with your own eyes and
therefore it's true it's right there on
video
but of course the last couple years
we've learned that video is the biggest
liar
it's the easiest way to lie is a
misleading edit
and there's a video on the internet
that people are saying in the comments
that what they're seeing in the video is
that the law enforcement
opened up a door and left the protesters
into the capitol
so that's what the comment on the video
says you can see it with your own eyes
there are police officers opening the
door to let people
in and then you watch the video and
nothing like that's on the video
you see a door open but there's no law
you know
there's no suggestion that the police
did it there was somebody on the inside
but probably a protester who got in
there and opened the door
so it's
the the ability of people to be fooled
is going to like
a whole new level it seems like that you
can actually look at the video that
doesn't show that thing
and then tweet it with a statement that
says look at that thing on this video
and it's just not there
this is not there what the hell
all right apparently according to
rasmussen trump's approval is up
since the protests what do you think
trump's approval is going to be after he
gets kicked off at twitter
you know he has been i feel like it
might go up
what happens to trump's approval the
less you can hear about him tweeting
goes up but here's the uh
the interesting thing to me so the
things that
trump got banned for ultimately were
nothing you should get banned for in any
of our opinions
i mean it's obviously subjective but i
don't think anybody thought there was
any content that was ban a bull
even the acl aclu no friend of the
president
even they're saying it went too far
um but apparently one of the tweets just
before he got banned was he was talking
about
starting a competing platform to twitter
now is it a coincidence is it a
coincidence
that as soon as trump said something
that was vital to the bottom line of
twitter
that he was going to start a competing
platform
that that's when he got kicked off the
platform for something that didn't look
like
a big deal is that a total coincidence
that he was using twitter to take down
twitter
they banned him i don't think so
i mean uh i don't know if anybody was at
the meeting and said it out loud
hey trump's talking about a competition
let's
let's use an excuse to kick him off i
doubted anybody said that out loud
but if you own twitter stock
and you see trump talking about making
your stock
worth less which way are you going to
decide
if you own twitter stock would you let
trump stay on there talking about stuff
that would make your stock price go down
i think you'd find a reason to get them
off and it might not be the strongest
reason
if you know what i mean if you catch my
meaning
so i would say that everything about the
way
twitter has treated that raises
questions
so dominion voting system is suing
sydney powell for 1.3 billion dollars
defamation lawsuit
and i think she's got trouble she's got
trouble
because the claims that she made were
really
specific and really really debunked
so she might have a problem there
and when i saw the number suing for 1.3
billion i thought
well that's like a crazy number right he
can't sue for
um
there's somebody yelling at me in all
caps scott spelled wrong with one tea
in all caps this isn't about stocks
boomer
uh did i say this was about stocks
it's one variable it's one variable
all caps guy relax
relax i have some advice for you all
caps guy
you'll probably see a lot of people
making comments in a public
way you know they'll write their comment
and then it'll show up on the screen and
then
sometimes thousands or tens of thousands
of people read those comments
that's not for you that's not for you
you you maybe should whisper to people
that you know really well
tweeting in public not your strong suit
just rethink it that's all i'm saying
maybe maybe put your energy somewhere
where you're not
embarrassed
anyway the when i thought this 1.3
billion dollar defamation suit against
sydney powell that's probably not too
far
off from what this is going to cost them
i wouldn't be surprised
if dominion lost over a billion dollars
i mean that certainly seems possible
because if people believe these
allegations
now i of course have said that any any
uh
digital system can be compromised so
if you believe that their digital
systems are the ones that have not been
compromised
it's probably because you did a deep
audit of it yourself right
because nobody else did nobody audited
that stuff
so um i would say that i have no
specific
reason to think there's anything wrong
with this system or any other
except that 100 of the times that you
have the
setup somebody's gonna hack it
every time you don't know if it was this
year you don't know if it's happened in
the past you don't know if it'll happen
in the future
or when but it happens every time
it's not it's not like this will be the
one situation there won't be a hacker
that's not a thing uh here's some more
stuff that got uh
removed i guess uh steve bannon's the
war room got removed from youtube
google play is getting rid of parlor and
apple might as well
gab is already banned on google play and
apple store
so if you don't think this is serious
that's pretty serious
i went down i thought i went down 40 000
followers on twitter in the last few
days and is it a coincidence that the
purge starts
that the purge began right on january 6
when biden was sworn in it feels as if
that date was picked because uh
because that would be the safest day to
do it
so i don't know how many of the the
removed
users are because of bots being removed
i think that's the biggest reason i
think the main reason was
getting rid of bots but i think uh
the uh yeah
but you also wonder how many people just
left the platform so a lot of people
left
and have gone to uh the locals platform
i will tell you that if i get banned
here you could find me on a subscription
platform called locals and the url would
be
scott adams all one word dot locals
with an s dot com so i'll be there if
if anything happens to this um
lindsey graham he says he tweeted he
says i'm more determined than ever to
strip
section 230 protections from big tech
now keep in mind lindsey graham if you
strip those protections from big tech
you're also stripping it from parlor and
gab
and parlor and gab would go on a
business pretty much the same day
because they allow more free speech
which allows
uh you know more bad uh
bad voices to be part of the system and
so if they had to
uh start moderating all of their voices
if parl parlor and gab did then they
would just become twitter
so the only choice they would have is to
become twitter at which point there's no
point
in having them or they just get sued out
of business for having you know nazis on
their website
so um lindsey graham
you're a little bit too late i don't see
any way that a section 230 thing could
work uh
in the coming administration do you i
don't i don't believe that the
opportunity to regulate
the social media companies
exists anymore i think on about january
6th
the the even the possibility of
regulating the social media companies
just went away
so you know lindsey graham can talk
about it
but it's not going to happen because the
social media companies just have too
much power
and they're too connected with the
democrats it just can't happen
there's just no way that can happen so
there's no point in talking about it
actually
um weird story that uh there
there was a lot of job loss recently in
december
and but women lost jobs at a rate of 10
to one compared to
to men or nine to one or something it's
something in that range you know like
ten to one
now why would that make sense in a world
in which a female employment had been
zooming to the point where actually for
a while it was higher there were more
women working than men
i mean that's how good female employment
was it just dipped below that number
but why would it be that women would
lose jobs 10 to 1
or something in that range and the the
answer that i saw i don't know if it's
true is the teachers unions
is there anything that the teachers
unions haven't broken
because the teachers unions are keeping
the schools closed they have the power
to
you know influence that and because we
live in a
sexist gender sexist country
more women are staying home because the
kids have to stay home from school than
the men now
who saw that coming so i don't think
there's anything
that you can't blame on teachers unions
at this point
so teachers unions are you know
brainwashing people that
you know gets you this kind of situation
they're
preventing school choice which is the
fundamental cause of
structural racism because if you can't
get a good
education you're not going to get ahead
so as long as the teachers unions are
destroying the country from the
from the bottom up by destroying
education and the opportunity to have
competition and education we would make
it good
as opposed to what it is now um
teachers unions are now invulnerable
because of the biden administration
so now teachers unions the most malign
influence in the country
are now completely safe the second most
malign influence which also has lots of
benefits right
there there aren't anything that's
completely bad or completely good
would be social media and social media
now is
completely invulnerable under a biden
administration
so the two most negative forces in the
country
just became invulnerable under under
biden
am i wrong is that is that hyperbole the
two
most destructive forces just became
invulnerable
i think that's true i don't think that's
an exaggeration
all right um how long do you think
republicans will be allowed to use
banking
you know when we had lots of uh
non-digital systems and people could be
anonymous and you know
you could use your little bank and it's
not connected to anything else
everybody could make mistakes or be
unpopular and they can still
live a life but what happens when
what happens when you you get to the
point where you say something in a tweet
and all of your banking gets turned off
you know that's a thing right that's a
thing already
that if you say something in public that
uh is not popular
that you can't bank now what can you do
in this world if you can't
bank well you could try to get by with
crypto but it's not much of a life right
at the moment
that'll probably correct itself in a few
short years
but at the moment you wouldn't be able
to start a business get a loan
anything so the ability of the
fake news to just cancel you
is reaching you know higher and higher
levels to the point where
once the government gets this power and
it will
of course the government will be able to
just
turn off any critic so let's take me for
example
have i done anything that would in your
opinion
earn me a ban or get me kicked off of
banking
i think the answer is no and i i try
really really hard
to make sure i know where that line is
and i don't say anything that would
uh cause trouble and if there's a story
in the news that
turns out to be not true i think i'm
pretty consistent in saying oh
i was wrong not true as soon as i know
i think you would find that i've
probably debunked more
conspiracy theories than anybody so i'm
not really in the business of promoting
them as much as debunking them
so if you were to look at you know my
body of work you'd say
no he's okay he'll be okay
but here's the thing there's a lot of
subjectivity involved in that isn't
there
how much subjectivity would it take
to take me from my safe little content
to just stretch that over the line a
little bit
to where i'm bannable just because of
somebody's opinion of what i said
maybe not even because of what i said
now
am i vulnerable to being banned because
someone
else has an incorrect opinion
of what i said the answer is yes our
current system
allows somebody else to say you know in
my opinion scott
you've crossed the line even if i
haven't
even if i haven't and they can just turn
me off
now the banks can do the same thing
how long do you think it will take
before they figure that out so here's
here's the play you might see people
like me targeted for
destruction i would expect that you're
seeing it already by by the way
if you're following me on social media
you know that they are coming for me
and there will always be a reason
that's not the real reason so the reason
will be
somebody else's opinion turned into fake
news
of what i did or did not say the fake
news will become
what i have to explain but i can't do
you know why i won't be able to explain
it away
because it's on social media and fake
news and
they control who sees what i don't have
a chance i mean i can say what i can say
but they could just suppress it
so let's say
this scenario let's say there's somebody
who's got a strong association with
jack dorsey or let's just say somebody
on twitter let's take
jack out of it doesn't have to be his
personality because that
that just makes everything confusing
let's just say it's twitter
and there's some executives there who
who could push the button and erase me
all right and if some politician knows
this person at twitter
and says you know it would really be
good for the cause
to get rid of a guy who talks about
persuasion
and is maybe helping the other team
wouldn't it be good if there were less
of him
and now the person at twitter
hypothetically this is just a
speculative kind of thing
says to themselves well i'll take a look
at him and if he's done
anything to violate our guidelines then
we'd have cause
but i'm not aware of anything so then he
starts looking at my twitter feed
do you think somebody who's looking for
a problem
could find one every time yeah there
would be no chance that they couldn't
find one
and yet there's nothing there as far as
i know
i've never done anything that would be
even really
close to that line that i know of i mean
i'm not aware of anything that's even
close to the line
but so easily it could be interpreted as
something that i didn't say meaning more
than it meant
wrong context leave out something etc
so then what happens if that twitter
executive
does a favor for his friend the
democratic senator this is all just made
up none of this is happening and
and they take me off what do i do what's
my recourse
my recourse is nothing
nothing there's no recourse twitter was
talking at one point about having some
kind of independent
uh mechanism for judging who gets kicked
off
but that's not happened and i think that
enough time has gone by that you should
assume it won't
i don't think there's much chance that's
going to happen so
if there's no process for getting kicked
off
and you can get kicked off because of an
opinion
somebody else's opinion not your own why
wouldn't they come for me
really right why wouldn't they try to
get rid of me
it would be the smart play
so i think people like me will be
targeted for destruction
and if you said well scott you can go to
one of those other platforms
no you can't no you can't
you know you could try but not many
people would see you there
and you wouldn't be interacting with the
other side which is the whole fun of it
anyway
um but what happens if they turn off my
banking
that could happen how hard would it be
for somebody to get to somebody in one
of the
payment processing companies stripe or
something like that
and just say you know you've got
standard stripe
and this guy and then stripe would say
well what did he say
you know we need some we need some
information we can't just ban somebody
because you want them
i go well look at the news look what it
says on social media that this guy did
he's already been banned by twitter
already got kicked off of youtube
so why are you giving him banking
see what happens you don't need
any new rules you don't need any new
laws
you don't need anything to change and
people like me can be kicked off of both
social media and
banking with no recourse no recourse
and that's our current situation
[Laughter]
that's right now now you don't think
that's dangerous
the only thing that i would add to that
i might get kicked off social media
right now
let's see if i can uh word this in a way
that keeps me here for another day
all right yeah stripe did it to gavin
mcginnis
somebody's saying in the comments so
this is real by the way
what i'm describing is something that
already happens
i'm not talking about something that
might happen you get that right
this is happening now i'm just saying
that they could just do more of it and
it could
pick me up easily it would be easy to to
disappear me if they want to
but here's the part though
i gotta say this really carefully
let me say it generally i'm gonna i
could say it in the most
general way and then you can fill in
with your own mind
what i mean and it goes like this
i'm probably the last person you want to
 with
i'll just say that probably just about
the last person in the world
you want to with because i am
really really flexible about most things
i'm really really flexible if somebody
makes a mistake or they criticize me
yeah no big deal i mean i tend to
respond to criticisms but that's just
for fun
but if uh
if i got taken out just to take me out
that might put me in a whole different
mood
whole different mood and
i'm just saying i'm the last person you
want to with
um so we'll see what happens there
the fbi released a poster of 10 of the
capital rioters who they have a good
pictures of their faces
and they're publishing the 10 faces
because they're looking for the public
to help them
identify them what's wrong with this
story
before i tell you what's wrong with the
story this this is being reported it's
i think it's a real thing that the fbi
has
10 faces they're asking the public to
help them identify
what's wrong with that story
see if you know and remember that the
faces are really clear you can see them
really well
what's wrong with the story that they're
asking the public to identify them
here's what's wrong with the story they
don't need the public to identify them
they know who they are so why are they
asking the public
when i say they know who they are have
you heard that there is facial
identification
applications you don't think the fbi has
facial identification such as
i don't know which one they use but
clearview ai is the
the leader in the field you think
there's nobody in the fbi
who has the app that thousands of law
enforcement
agencies use routinely nobody at the fbi
knows that there's a facial recognition
app that they can have in
uh i don't know 30 minutes it would take
them to
you know buy a license for it
what's wrong with the story
the fbi publishing these faces
i don't know what the purpose is but
it's certainly not identification
because they know who they are you could
call somebody today
i could literally do this i could
literally
personally get their identities probably
in half an hour you know if i had access
to the app but you have to be law
enforcement to do it
so you could pretty much find somebody
in law enforcement who has the app
and without you know any any violation
of any licenses or
privacy say hey do you have the app
and the let's say some police officer
somewhere says yeah we use this all the
time
and you say did you see this tweet
here's ten faces
point your app at the at the tweet and
tell me who they are
and this is how hard it would be here's
here's the
here's the tweet and then you take your
uh
your your other phone with the app and
you just point it at it
and you identify them instantly
now you're telling me the fbi doesn't
know that
what is the fbi doing are
is it part of demonizing trump
supporters
is that what's happening because i can't
think of a reason they do it
unless it's just some automatic process
and you know it's
maybe it's just the process that they
always publish them or something i don't
know
but i got a question because they
certainly don't need to do it
by the time that was tweeted they had
all those names
you know long before somebody could have
done a photoshop
to put the 10 10 faces onto a page
the time it would take you to photoshop
the page of the ten
faces is way longer than it took to
identify them
literally this is them identified them
snap and there's the name
that's literally it if you haven't seen
it done
it's shocking it's shocking that it
works
and it basically works every time for
all practical purposes
have i considered starting my own bank
well i do have a
uh a crypto the when so i have my own
currency
well that's a start uh
oh yeah and somebody's saying it's it's
uh the fbi
thing is training people to snitch
maybe i don't have a better theory
i don't know that that's true but why
else would you put down a list
and ask for help on something you don't
need help on if there's some other
reason
it's definitely not identification
why limit it to law enforcement well you
don't want your stalker to have it
you know there are reasons that facial
recognition
probably needs to be limited if you were
to fast forward 20 years from now
yeah it'll be ubiquitous in 20 years but
at the moment
while we're feeling our way through the
market i think limiting it to
law enforcement makes sense that's just
a good guard rail for now
but it'll change um
treating them like outlaws well that's
the point
is that they were breaking some laws
um what is the freest place on earth i
don't know
good question was there a poster of
antifa and blm writers probably
i mean i wouldn't say there wasn't
that's why i'm saying the fbi
just might have a process where it
doesn't even matter if they've already
been identified there's just somebody's
job it is to put things on posters
so maybe it's the person whose job it
was to put things on a poster just
went ahead and did it even though it
didn't have to happen
um
treason needs to be dealt with well
here's the problem with treason
treason would be helping china take over
the united states
unambiguous and we'd all agree well
there's some treason right there
there's a traitor but what if there's a
genuine and legitimate agreement
disagreement
about who won the election
and who is the one doing the coup
so if you're uh trying to take over the
capital because you're trying to
stop a coup is that the same as
taking over the capital because you are
a coup
because who was it who got to decide
that the protesters were a coup
versus people trying to stop a coup
who got to decide well
social media fake news
they get to decide
now you can say to me but scott scott
scott
the protesters were operating under bad
information
bad information about the election
having problems
and since there was no court case or
official
ruling that there was any problem that
therefore
they're the they're the treasonous ones
now wait a minute that doesn't make any
sense if they were just mistaken
it's not treason they were just mistaken
if they thought they were doing a
counter a coup
to a coup that just took over the united
states they are
patriots they are misguided patriots
and the ones with the pipes broke the
law
and they will have to pay for that but
why were they doing it were they doing
it because they thought they were
overthrowing a
legitimate government or did they do it
because they thought they were
uh stopping a coup which would have been
cheating in the election to get the
wrong
people elected
i think the minimum requirement to call
somebody
treasonous or a traitor is that they
have to in their own mind
be working against the best interests of
the country
they would have to be working against
our constitution
in their minds they were working for it
i won't say that's true of every single
person with a pipe in their hand
but in general in general
they were working for the benefit of the
country
to keep the united states strong and to
make sure they had not been
fallen to a coup that is literally the
opposite
of treason that is
opposite because the only thing that
mattered is what they
thought when they were doing it in terms
of how you label it
now in terms of what they were thinking
when they did it
doesn't make any difference to the
criminality of it
and unfortunately we all have to accept
that because you can't have a system
where somebody with a pipe can get away
with it because they had bad information
right if you kill your neighbor with a
pipe and then later say
ah i had bad information i thought my
lawyer
my neighbor did something bad turns out
he didn't
but you know you can't convict me
because in my mind i thought i was
actually doing a good thing
that doesn't work you can't use that
with the legal system
you just sort of have to blame the
person who had the pipe in their hand
or the whole system falls apart but
treason
treason is an opinion and it's not based
on any observation
do you think there was anybody in that
crowd who would have said to you
yeah we do think biden won fair and
square
but still we don't like it so we're
going to try to overthrow the government
because even though the election was
fair we don't like the outcome do you
think you could get even
one person to say that literally one
could you get one person to say that in
that crowd i'll bet not
i bet there wouldn't be one person who
in their minds
thought they were doing anything
remotely like treason
they thought they were protecting the
country now why is it
that somebody could be so uninformed
according to other people how could they
be so
uninformed according to social media and
fake news
well could it be the information comes
from the sources that don't give good
information
fake news and social media i i would
think they would be to blame
so that's enough for today
um nobody knows exactly where all this
is going
but there is a breaking point
nobody knows where it is but
there is a breaking point
trump i think is a special case in in
every way he's a special
case and he certainly was intentionally
pushing you know pushing the boundary uh
he knew he was doing it he knew
the odds of him being banned were really
high so i'm not sure we can count him
like everything else but if you see me
disappear
and i think that's at least a 50 50
chance at least maybe higher
if you see me disappear
that's the beginning not the end
that's all i'm going to say if i
disappear that's the beginning
and you'll you'll know what to do at the
time all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you tomorrow
bye for now
