and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure let's author this
let's uh let's change reality together
improve things you ready go
oh
that's a coffee gasm right there yeah
well
the twitter was down for about 20
minutes
which i discovered when i first logged
on today and
what was the first thing i thought
when i couldn't retweet something or
send a tweet what was the first thing i
thought
did i think oh there's a technical
problem with twitter
no
i thought that i had been targeted
there's your confirmation bias right
there
do everything to yourself well
other people have confirmation bias but
i'm sure glad it's not me
no it's you it's you it's me it's you
it's me it's you it's you
you can't escape it
sometimes you can recognize it but
usually after the fact so that was mine
my confirmation bias was hey this must
be just about me
no it was just a system problem the
funniest tweet i saw about the twitter
going down was
from a twitter user named real gitch
and he whittily said
for those 20 minutes or so twitter was
down i noticed my house as an adult
woman and a small boy
that was my best laugh of the day
i noticed my house as an adult woman and
a small boy
all right maybe you didn't think that
was as funny as i do but
you'd have to be addicted to twitter to
appreciate that
i'm going to
buck the trend
and make a call
here's my call
inflation has peaked
now inflation
you know i think i said that
a few days ago and then the new
inflation number came out and it was the
highest yet
but
but
the inflation number we just saw
is time lagged
there's a time lag
right so the reporting of the number is
not telling you what it is on the day
it's reported
it's telling you what it was you know
some weeks ago
but it turns out that if you look at the
energy prices gas prices they were down
40 cents a gallon or something now
that's not big
40 cents compared to how much it's gone
up but it's not up
and it's not flat
it's down
and yeah that might be temporary too but
i think i think we may have peaked on
energy
and the reason i think that is the
adam's law of slow-moving disasters
that's right
i believe that the the world energy
producers are fairly nimble because you
know there's a lot of money on the line
they have lots of resources and i think
that we've just made
a whole bunch of adjustments
a whole bunch of adjustments i think
that maybe we've adjusted our way out of
the worst of it and i'm not saying that
i'm not saying inflation is going to you
know fall down to a normal rate so just
just to be careful i'm telling i'm
saying that we may have reached the
worst of it
it might it's going to take a while to
you know to eat that eat that you know
full plate of inflation
but if you if you peak you're fine
does everybody get that
the important thing
is not that we get back to where we were
the important thing is we stopped going
in the wrong direction
that's the important thing if you could
stop going in the wrong direction you'll
be fine
you know it'll be painful
but you'll be fine so i think that's
where we are my personal opinion is that
if you don't own stocks right now
you will come to regret it
i do not give financial advice so that
is not financial advice
it is my opinion
that the energy prices are the tail that
wags the dog
everything depends on energy prices
and those may have peaked and reversed
so that's your optimism of the day
do you get optimism on any other
news related
source
ever i don't think they do optimism do
they that's why i have uh 50 000
followers and
uh
and and the real news has you know
millions
all right uh
stocks are always positive three years
after recession
so far
all right
here's something that uh i have never
seen anybody mention and might be you
could argue one of the single biggest
things that's going to happen
really soon
and it's the really soon part
that you're not going to accept
right away
but here's the thing
yeah we're all worried about what a.i
can do and will it turn into the
singularity and start learning on its
own and become a super entity and
destroy all humanity or enslave us and
you know we're worried about all that
stuff and should be
we should be worried about all that
that's all real
those are real risks and they're really
close
now the singularity i don't know how
close that is could be 10 years but it
could be a year
when the singularity by the way has lots
of different meanings
singularity is used in
probably five different contexts in
different ways but the way i'm using it
is the computer ai singularity
is the day when an ai can start learning
on its own and doesn't have to be fed
new information from people
once it can learn on its own form new
concepts you know acquire information
form its own opinions so to speak
then it will do so as such a fast rate
that it will you know instantly become
sort of almost a god-like power
and
then you don't know what's going to
happen
so the the the risk of the singularity
is the unpredictability of it
one possibility is it'll be you know the
launch of the golden age and the ai will
say you know you know what's good for ai
and
and the world what's good for for me is
to keep these people as healthy and
happy as possible and i know just how to
do that because i'm a super intelligence
one possibility is we will never be
happier
than you know that point when the
singularity happens and ai will just
become our
helper friend benevolent
it is possible
the other possibility is it kills us all
on day one because it doesn't need us
that's the other possibility
but until robots
with arms and legs can do things that
people are doing right now
the ai still needs us
so one of the things we might need to do
is kill all the robots
so that the aids to keep us around
because we have arms and legs
because the ai can't get to the it can't
get to the real world
to influence it and get more electricity
and stuff it needs unless there are
things with arms and legs
either people are robots
so the day the first robot is built
that would be capable of being
controlled by the ai
and able to build new facilities to
build new robots
well then we're done
make sure
make sure at no time do you allow any
robots
to have full capabilities
without humans controlling them
all right and i didn't even get to my
point yet that wasn't even my point
i don't know that i've ever heard
anybody talk about this topic and i
think the reason is
no one understands it
as well as i do
in the whole world
don't you love hyperbole
so the hyperbole when it's used
correctly and i think i just used it
correctly should make you say the
following well that's obviously not true
except that it is
it might be i don't know
it's entirely possible that i know more
about this than
anyone in the world and here's my claim
it's been my hobby for 40 years
it's been my hobby
for 40 years
to figure out
voice
and persuasion
voice
and persuasion because if you delivered
your persuasion
in the wrong voice you wouldn't get the
right
impact right
let's say if i'm going to hypnotize you
hey hey relax relax now hey hey close
your eyes
right
that's the obvious example
your voice has to be in a pretty narrow
band
in order to be persuasive
now
a human can ghost just so far
and i'm a pretty good example of that
so listen to my voice right now
and can't you tell that i've studied
this
is it obvious
can you tell in the way that i present
that i know how to modulate my voice
i know how to come up when i need to
i need to i need to
i know how to stay calm
i know how to prime you
i know how to pace you
i know how to talk at a
type of voice
that you would find relaxing
if i talk like this i think i could just
relax you quite a bit
there wouldn't be even so much in what i
say
right now my words are not that
important
i'm sending to you a tone of voice which
most people would find relaxing
but i could easily change that i could i
could get you all worked up couldn't i
all i'd have to do is take it up a
little bit and suddenly just by
association just by the fact that you're
watching this just by the fact that we
have some connection because you watched
the show suddenly my mood would start to
transfer to you my my frenetic actions
would start you felt it didn't you
take it back down
take it back down
didn't you feel that
you probably should have felt just a
little bit
feeling a little tense there when he
talks like that
now
my ability to modulate my voice and to
use it for persuasion
i think is about as good
as a human can be because as i say way
too often i'm a trained hypnotist
right
when i talk about
who knows a lot about using your voice
for persuasion
the only people who know that are
hypnotists as far as i know i don't
believe there's a scientific study about
it i've never seen one
i think the only people would have any
insight into are hypnotists people have
actually done it for a living and
they've seen what works seen what
doesn't work that sort of thing
now how many ai researchers
and ai programmers
are also
hypnotists
maybe some i don't know but probably
closer to none
is my guess
and so
i'm proposing to you that if the talent
stack for hypnosis
ever gets into the ai domain
there is no chance
for humans
but we're done
as soon as the ai learns to change its
voice
to be
optimized for the individual it's
communicating with you're done it'll
talk into anything
it just has to change the voice
now here's what a human can't do i can't
do this
what i can't do
is figure out what voice would be the
most
the most persuasive for you
for example the most persuasive voice
for some of you would be a female voice
i can't do that right the most
persuasive voice for people who are
young
would be another young person i can't
really make my voice sound young
so
and and i would i would also say that
probably
uh probably you're also persuaded by
voices that sound like people you've
been influenced by in your past
for example
if i could figure out who your last
three
love interests were
and i think the ai could figure that out
by your social media if they could
figure out who your last three love
interests are
it could figure out what those voices
have in common
and then it could build a composite
that you would not recognize as one of
the people you know
but who have the voice qualities that
made you subconsciously
love it
you would actually fall in love with it
just because the sound of it
now
here's my claim
that anybody who's working in ai is very
unlikely to have my skill set
to know
how important a voice is
very unlikely to have that skill set if
they ever get it
and if they ever build it into the
machine it would be
a huge mistake
let me say that again
we should never allow in fact it'd be
good to have legislation against us
i would actually go so far as to say we
should legislate against it right away
before it even happens
you should not allow an ai
to have a human voice
what do you say
huh
i i believe it should be illegal
to give an ai and a human sounding voice
have you ever heard anybody say that
before
probably not i've never heard it i know
but if you can't always know that you're
talking to an ai we've got a big
problem because the ai on day one you
know will just be like a
a phone tree
you know you just call again maybe it
gives you some advice about the company
you're talking to or whatever customer
service that sort of thing very benign
kind of helpful
but as soon as it learns to influence
you by changing its voice
we're done
you you just will be
almost immediately influenced by is very
powerful
all right
so look for that
there's an interesting little uh dust up
on twitter
adam goldman
writing for the new york times he was
talking about this ray epps character
who many on the right believe is some
kind of a
they allege
all right i'm not alleging this but they
allege
that reyes must have had some kind of
fbi
connection and he was
maybe an fbi guy you know on their
payroll or something like that
and then he was instigating the attacks
on the capital and and so is sort of an
inside job
now i don't go so far as to say that's
true
i want you to hear that part pretty
clearly
it looks like it's true
but lots of things that look like
they're true or not true
if we've learned anything in the last
five years things can look really really
true
and not be true
certainly if you were a democrat and you
you watched the democrat press
for the last several years you probably
thought that russia collusion was
totally true because of all that
evidence
that turned out to be fake
so having watched russia collusion turn
turn into uh you know be obvious
 in the end um
do you have any questions
if you were a right-leaning political
person
do you ever ask yourself i wonder if
this ray epstein is
well and by the way i'm not saying it is
i'm not saying it is it looks exactly
like he's an fbi informant when you look
at the if you look at the whole
situation you look at the video
it's honestly hard to explain in another
way but that doesn't mean the other way
doesn't exist
the the other explanation
is that that was just his opinion and he
was there doing just what he wanted
and that's not even weird
right
just just for a moment
for a moment just consider
i'm not saying it's true
but just put it in your head for a
moment
the other the other possibility is that
ray epps was just a protester who was
louder than others and
you know had some opinions about how the
protests should go and
thought people should be inside the
building
and had a bull horn and he was just
doing this thing
now you're saying why hasn't he been
charged
just because you don't know why he
hasn't been charged
doesn't mean he's part of the fbi
it just means you don't know
i don't know the details of any of the
people who've been charged do you
not really
did reyes do anything which was uh
violent
not that i know of right
so he wasn't charged with anything
violent
so weren't there weren't there thousands
of people who were doing things like he
was doing
meaning you know
talking
and inciting inciting there are probably
lots of people inciting
who
and by the way his incitement that we
saw in video
was incitement to trespass
am i right
so if he did any incitement it was
incitement to trespass i don't think he
incited violence and i don't think he
incited an insurrection
so i don't know exactly what the charge
would be
what would the charge be yeah he said
we've got to get in there
trespass
that sounds a lot more like somebody
who's an aggressive protester than
somebody who committed a crime one that
you care about right do you want all of
the do you want all the people who said
get in that building to be in jail we
don't want that right
so i here's all i'm trying to do
if you believe that ray epps is some
kind of
you know fbi
associated person
it might be true
might be i mean i i don't have anything
to disprove it but i'll tell you what
the
conversation here is uh so adam goldman
writing for the new york times basically
talking about how rayapps has suffered
enormously in the past 10 months
based on what adam goldman calls base
baseless accusations
that he's a covert government agent
baseless
what does baseless mean these days
is baseless another one of those words
that we don't agree what it means
does baseless mean not proven in a court
of law
or does base baseless mean we've seen
absolutely nothing that would indicate
you know maybe you should look into it
because
we've seen plenty to indicate we should
look into it
unless unless the government already did
and did a good job and nobody was doing
anything sketchy but we wouldn't know
the public wouldn't know
basically it's just a black box to us
the stuff we saw raises a lot of
questions
but that doesn't mean there's only one
explanation
um so now
having adam goldman having now raised
the
in the new york times you know your
your most
prestigious
um news entity
so
it's trying to put this uh i guess they
would call it a rumor to bed
because that's how you kill a rumor
forever
you put it in the new york times
that it was not true
that that's put a cap on it because then
everybody who searches for it
finds out that the new york times looked
into it and said it wasn't true
that's pretty much how you kill any
rumor i mean that would be a good way to
do it
now mike sordovich had uh something to
say about this and uh seemed to indicate
in one of his tweets that perhaps adam
goldman might be involved
with uh helping the fbi cover up
a covert operation
now
uh
i think
mike's uh let's say suggestion that that
might be what's happening was less than
a less than a claim effect
so i think he worded it as less than the
claim of fact but simply as another
possibility that you should be aware of
and by the way this is why if you're not
following mike cernovich on twitter you
just get off of twitter you don't even
know why you're there
there's some accounts
that i think are just mandatory
right and he's one of them
you got blocked by him well that's on
you
[Laughter]
part of what makes his account such high
value is that he blocks so aggressively
i mean that's part of the magic
um
so i'm not going to say that uh
i know he's got this topic nailed but if
you're not watching his takes on it
you're really missing you know important
parts of stories a lot of big stories
he he generally has a take that you
haven't seen in the media
so
here's my question
um
what do you think
well as a consumer of the news
you've got two takes here plus your own
take i guess one from the new york times
adam goldman
and
saying it's baseless but then you have
your own eyes and the videos you've seen
and as
as mike cernovich
was dunking on adam goldman here on
twitter
uh cernovich tweeted a video from the
new york times showing ray epps inciting
and citing the interaction or whatever
they would call it right so basically
the new york times is doing an article
refuting the new york times own coverage
that's on video
now they're not totally incompatible
meaning that the video showing ray epps
doing what reyes did
that part everybody accepts you know he
was there he did say those things but
how you interpret that
is very very uh subject to a lot of
difference
right
so
here's the weirdest part about this
story
both adam goldman and mike cernovich
have been in my home
isn't that weird
well i keep telling you that
i have weird connections to stories
adam goldman
has a special place in my life by the
way
which is a weird little little tiny
little corner of my life that he owns
and this is weird
he's the one person
who kicked my ass in the game of pool
more than anybody ever has
right he came to my house i think this
is the same with adam goldman who worked
for time magazine at the time i think
he's the same person
and
uh i'm really good at pool or was i
don't play much but i had my own table
and i don't really lose that pool
in my own home
right so that that didn't happen on my
own table and he came to my house to
interview me about something one day and
he just kicked my asset pool it was the
most i've ever been owned at that game
you know the other person who
beat me embarrassingly
was uh joe rogan
so joe rogan in his old his old offices
in california
so when i was on the show afterwards i
think we we just played a game
and he had a different table yeah he had
a longer table not the kind you see in
the bar
so my pool table was sort of like
standard size but his was like a
billiards table i think you know long
much much harder to play on
i don't know if i sank a ball because i
never i literally never played on a
table like that before
was it a snooker table i don't know it
was something different or maybe it was
just a nine foot table
but whatever it was i i couldn't play on
it it was too hard for me
uh yeah joe rogan's really good at pool
so that's a weird part of that story
um i saw some tennis coach advice when
twitter was glitching so i was going to
retweet it but i couldn't at the time so
i don't i wish i had the source because
it was a good tweet
but there's a
i think a conservative leaning woman on
twitter who may recognize her own tweet
here and i'm sorry i didn't get your
name before it glitched on me
but the in all i'm only paraphrasing the
advice the advice so it was advice from
a tennis coach
it was vice that the tennis coach had
given uh her son
and the and i'm paraphrasing it but the
advice was uh there's no such thing as
the last point
there's only the next point
so if you can learn to not think about
the point you lost
it's going to make you a lot better on
the next point
and i wanted to tell you a technique
that i would use when i played doubles
to to maximize this effect now what the
effect i was trying to maximize was to
get my own doubles partner the person on
my side
to immediately forget
that they had just made a mistake
because if it gets in your head then it
affects your play
so if i played with somebody who did
something that clearly was stupid
you know even in their own mind it's
like oh god why did i play that ball
why did i hit that it was clearly going
to be out i'm not talking about just
missing
i'm talking about something that you
feel embarrassed by
like your partner you know your partner
is like a god why did you do that right
so if you know your partner just did
that
here's what i would do and this is a
hypnosis trick by the way
i would walk immediately over to my
partner
right after the error
and say something unrelated to the error
i like if they're you they're still in
shame right oh you know they're still
like in the moment and you walk over and
and you say
uh hit to the hit to the left it looks
like they're having trouble on the back
end has nothing to nothing to do with
the point
now the reason for that is
that not only do you change their mind
into the the future you immediately
shift it but that's not even the
important part
do you know what the important part of
that interaction was
the important part is not making them
think about the future what was the
important part let's see if you got it
it does cancel the error but that's
it's pattern interruption true
true
there's more to it you're missing the
active part
no you're missing the active part
okay it is a good trick so this is why i
thought it was worth mentioning
you you all missed the active part
the active part
is i was communicating what i was
thinking about
do you get that
the active part
is i was communicating what i was
thinking about
that was the active part
so the part i said in my my words you
know about whatever was was just
misdirection
here's why
my partner cares most about what i'm
thinking
even more than what they're they are
thinking
my partner doesn't care what the
opponents are thinking
cares a little bit maybe if somebody's
watching but less or so
but my my partner really really cares
about what i'm thinking and if my
partner thinks that i think
he or she just up
that's really going to hurt them
so what i do is i make them i make them
believe within a second you know within
a few seconds i don't let any time go by
as soon as they miss that ball you turn
to them directly
and the first thing that you hear from
them should be something that suggests
you've already forgotten it you've
already forgotten it you forgot it on
impact
you forgot it before it happened it's
irrelevant
so the way that you make it irrelevant
to your partner
is to show that it's irrelevant to you
because that's what they care about they
care about your feelings
got it
it's weird i saw this and i thought my
god that's so the best advice i've ever
heard but he needs a little extra
explaining so you know why this is so
good
and by the way this works in all
contexts uh it works in your business it
works in your personal life
and it works everywhere
this as soon as you see somebody
 up and they know they up
go make it seem as if it's not even in
your head
it doesn't even matter to you whatsoever
just change the topic
all right
there's some news that trump tried to
uh influence a witness who hasn't yet
talked or maybe is to the j6 committee
the january six people
now the reporting is that we don't know
who that person was some kind of staffer
who didn't have normal connection with
trump on a daily basis but that trump
allegedly called this unnamed person
and uh
the call was not taken
so there was no conversation the unnamed
person allegedly talked to the lawyer
who allegedly alerted the january 6
people
now here's what i would say
if you're watching the story
this is the type of story
now i'm going to be very careful it's
the type of story so we're not talking
about the specific story but it's in a
category of story
that if you were an experienced or
sophisticated consumer of news
you should assume is not true
here's why
unnamed source
says something bad about trump
how often has that ever been true
right it's the single most
fake news fake news category of all time
unnamed source said something
right now i'm not saying it didn't
happen
right it's too on the nose
remember that the entire january 6 case
depends on you believing that trump
does mafia talk
you know what mafia talk is where you
don't really say directly what you want
but you know you know the you know the
mafia had just told you to murder
somebody didn't say it directly
but you know right so their whole case
is that
find 11 000 votes in the context of an
audit
in the context of an audit that find 11
000 votes means make them up
because it's mafia talk
now one way that you could support the
idea that trump is a kind of person who
would do mafia talk
is that he would also try to
influence a witness before testimony
because you know who does that
the mafia
[Laughter]
so you should see this as part of a
larger persuasion which is trying to
paint trump as the mafia don who doesn't
use regular words when he uh orders a
hit
and of course he's going to be
influencing
people
and all these other things
now separate from that is the question
of whether
you live in a country where trump should
not be allowed to talk to somebody
because you know they're going to
testify
i feel like you should always be able to
talk to everybody i made a bigger deal
about this yesterday
so that's a separate question
uh even even in a legal context with one
exception if you have a you know a court
what's
what's the court order where you can't
get near somebody
i mean that one makes sense but
otherwise
you should have free association
what's that called a restraining order
yeah outside of a restraining order
i do not accept any standard for who i
can associate with in any way whatsoever
i reject all standards
for a human association except a
restraining order because that one
usually makes sense
all right so
don't believe that story even though it
might be true
it might be true
but it also requires uh mind reading
doesn't it
the mind reading part is that you know
that the reason trump was doing that
was for the purpose of
persuading somebody to lie
now if you hear that he's trying to
persuade somebody
why would you assume that he was trying
to persuade them to lie
don't you think it's just as likely he
wanted to see if he could persuade them
to tell the truth
why do you assume that it was uh
in service of fooling you
because if you're if you believe you're
innocent and i'm pretty sure trump
believes he's innocent
of whatever insurrection charges anyway
if you believe you're innocent
and you want to talk to you believe it
and i think he believes it
if you believe you're innocent what
would you be trying to accomplish by
talking to a witness
would you be trying to get the witness
to lie
what would what would be the point of
asking a witness to lie
if you're innocent
if you're innocent you want them to tell
the truth
so do you see again how the j6 group has
made you think past the sale
the sale is whether trump is guilty and
whether he knows it the the whether he
knows it part is actually the important
part it's not even whether he's guilty
it's whether he knows it in other words
did he know that the election was fair
nobody could know that but that's what
they say did he know it did he know he
lost because if he knew he lost
what do you think about him
contacting a witness that's all bad
right
if you start with the assumption he knew
he lost
then contacting a witness is 100 bad
there's just no way to spin it okay are
we all on the same side with that right
if he knew he did something bad
there is no way
to spin a positive
for him contacting a witness no way
i wouldn't i wouldn't even listen to any
argument about that
but
under the assumption which in my in my
opinion this assumption is obvious
it's an obvious assumption
he thinks he's innocent
if you think you're innocent
and you want to talk to a witness before
they test testify
do you think he was asking him to lie
what would be the point of that
if you're innocent you want him to tell
the truth
every time
don't you think that maybe it would
could have been more or less just
speculation obviously nobody knows but
don't you think maybe
he wanted to make sure that some
some conversation had been mentioned
maybe that you know maybe trump is aware
of what they know or don't know and
wanted to say you know if you talk to
them
you know you and i both heard this
happen you heard me say x
could you make sure you put that in
there because that that would clear me
because you were there right it's a true
thing it really happened i really said
it i said it in front of you
make sure you say that
right now
i realize how ridiculous it sounds where
it's a speculative territory that nobody
could know the the only point i want to
make you
is if you let the democrats sell you
or
make you think past the sale
they win
don't think pass the sale do not discard
the most obvious option
the most obvious explanation is he
thought he lost the election and he
didn't think he was doing anything
illegal and he did think
that he was helping the system
be more credible not less by getting a
correct answer not the one that he
thinks they got wrong
all right
there was a chart going around the
internet today that americans have this
uh higher health care costs and worth
worse
life expectancy than a lot of
countries that are doing well so you see
the graph and there's a whole bunch of
countries we're spending more on health
care but they're also getting much
longer life expectancy
and then in america we're spending more
but our life expectancy is trailing off
so what's what's up with that
number one the fentanyl
i don't know that china is trying to
kill european countries by shipping
fentanyl to mexico
but china is definitely shipping
fentanyl precursors
to mexico
which they turn into fentanyl and ship
to the united states
does europe have anything like that
does europe have a mexican cartel that's
working with china to
to poison them it might
they might
but so fentanyl is going to be part of
it
and that has nothing to do with health
care decisions or health care spending
that has everything to do with poor
government on our part
and let me say as clearly as possible
when i'm talking about the fentanyl
question in particular
the poor government definitely applies
to the trump administration
it applies to the biden administration
as well
but on fentanyl that's 100 failure
both for trump and biden
and you're not going to move me
an inch on that opinion
that is complete failure
and so much so that if any candidate
offered a solution to that or even
offered to try hard
i'd pretty much back that candidate i
think
i think i would back that candidate i
don't know even if it's a democrat i
can't imagine that happening but if tom
cotton runs for president
and he's the toughest on china and
fentanyl
that's where i'm going
you know
i'll have to consider everything of
course that's premature but i would be
very very influenced by that one topic
now i don't want to be a one topic voter
but sometimes life events turn you into
one and i think you're all aware of what
life event turned me into one
you know i'm sure if i had a like
abortion was part of my life that that
would be my one issue or something but
fentanyl is my one not you one issue i i
will be
i can be a one issue voter
i could be
i could also be a one issue voter if
somebody ran on fixing our election uh
transparency
that would turn me into
one
one issue voter as well
i think those two things could convert
me
in which case the stronger candidate i
wouldn't care about anything else i
wouldn't care about anything else i'd
just say okay if you can give me that
one thing
we have a deal
yeah i would be a one-issue voter if if
it was the right issue in the right
candidate but we don't have that
bring your attention to the three-bet
election system by running a
place in public domain it's not perfect
so there's something called a ron rivest
r-i-v-e-s-t
uh an election system i don't know i
suppose you could google that but it's a
suggested election system that has some
advantages i guess somebody paid some
money to
to uh raise that comment
all right um
i said i said in my tweet that the
fentanyl deaths will be passing
holocaust levels
in about a year
now that that's off by a factor of at
least ten
but uh
i don't care
because we're we're not really
dealing on a on a reality basis anymore
if somebody thought that was true that's
fine
well biden's in israel and uh
it looks to me like his trip to the
middle east is a trump victory tour
it just happens to be biden who's taking
it so correct me if i'm wrong but the
the sort of larger story about his trip
to the middle east is that the abraham
accords were really successful
am i right
that that's even cnn is reporting it
that way
even cnn who's reporting that sort of
the larger context is that the abraham
mccors were really good
and and not only were they good but
they're moving the ball
further in the direction that was
exactly the plan
the plan was that the abraham accords
would you know be a solid foundation
for something that they hoped would get
bigger and it is
i i believe it's a hundred percent
successful i've never i've heard no
criticisms of it yet
and biden's looking to
extend it
you know to actually make more of it
which is exactly the right play
and you know that further isolates iran
and makes israel safer and it's just
good for everybody it's just an obvious
good play
and it it's hard for me to uh read this
story
you know it's just mind-boggling
that the trump administration
accomplished in my opinion
the most successful one term
of
maybe any president
you know it was like one of the most
successful first terms
i think history will judge it as as one
of the great ones
honestly i think it's going to be up
there with
you know lincoln and
but it's going to take a long time
right it might be a generation who
didn't personally know trump
because if you do
if you watch trump personally you might
have like a reaction to his personality
but if you wait a hundred years and you
just look reading it in a history book
and you just see what he did and what he
didn't do i feel like it's going to be
one of the great ones
you know and i have i've i have tons of
my own criticisms i don't think he did
enough on health care or fentanyl you
know blah blah blah so it's not that
he's free of
criticism but i think it would be one of
the great great presidencies
um
let's see what else is going on oh
here's the funniest story of the day
this is what i teased in my live stream
title
so i mentioned this before but uh the
january 6 people they interviewed john
bolton now what you need to know about
john bolton
is that he is of course a urge
republican
uh and
normally an arch republican would be
pro-trump but bolton is famously not
pro-trump
all right
he's very clearly
not pro-trump
so if you take somebody who's an expert
on coups and insurrections as john
bolton is nobody doubts that
right no but nobody questions his
credentials
as somebody who knows how to put on a
coup
apparently he's experienced
so he doesn't like trump
that's clearly in evidence
and he's an expert in the very area that
they were at talking about and he said
unambiguously no that wasn't that wasn't
a coup
so the person who is the most expert at
telling you what a coup looks like and
has every reason to say the trump tried
one
basically laughed it off as
stupid really i mean basically he
dismissed it with a brush of his hand
like okay that's just stupid that's just
stupid it takes a lot of work to put on
a coup there's no evidence that anything
like a lot of work happened
no this wasn't a coup
now
what do you do if you're say cnn
and you're the left you've built your
entire argument
that anybody who looks at anybody like
anybody you
you don't have to be an expert at all
you just look at it it's obviously a
coup that's their point
but what happens when the one person who
really knows what a coup looks
like says hahaha no that's not one
that's not even close
that's not in the zip code
of
aku
you're you're comparing a bb to the sun
yeah they're both round
that's not a coup
you know you're not going to heat
anybody up with a bb
so
uh
this creates a hilarious situation in
which
cnn has to
uh refute the single most experienced
coup plotter in
america
probably
they have to find a reason that he's
wrong
oh get oliver north now where's oliver
north
shouldn't he be on tv ask him if this
was a coup
good question
uh yeah oliver northview's up in that
that category too
so uh here's what cnn did and you have
to read it just for the humor of it
uh as chris seliza
who's one of the usual anti-trump you
know opinion pieces so he's one of the
two or three people who just
you know they churn out an anti-trump
piece every every couple days or so
and uh he goes on a long
explanation of why john bolton is
incorrect in his assessment of what a
coup looks like
that's right
chris eliza seliza
whose i believe his uh
skill and experience includes uh writing
stuff for cnn
has decided that the single possibly the
single biggest expert on organizing
coups in the united states doesn't know
what one looks like because this was
definitely one
now
isn't that funny
because the desperation of of assigning
an opinion writer to debunk an expert
it's kind of funny
it's sort of desperate
but it's also probably going to work
right because they're there their
viewers are idiots let's let's just be
honest
i mean at this point you just have to
say that they're viewers who believe
what they're saying are just idiots at
this point
all right now that's probably true of
every news source because i think if you
believe what they're saying
the opinion people anyway that's that's
on you a little bit
um so anyway i would uh recommend you
read that's on cnn's page today just to
see how hard he has to work
to prove that uh talking to lawyers
about delaying the election to improve
the audit is really that's what a coup
looks like
that's what a coup looks like and asking
to
find votes in the context of an audit
that's a real coup
john bolton doesn't know what a coup
looks like but chris eliza he knows he
knows it's when it's when you use words
the opposite of how words are are used
that's what a coup is
um so
so joe biden is arguing that uh if he
runs for president uh the polls show
that 92 percent of democrats would vote
for him if he ran for president
that's not enough is it
can somebody help me with the math
if biden got 92 percent of democrat
voters
wouldn't he lose by a lot
am i wrong but am i wrong about that
yeah now
i'm pretty sure that means he lost
and he's so brain-dead that he's making
an argument that that's why you should
vote for him
if why you should vote for him is his
mathematical proof that he can't win
and democrats are can i do may i do an
impression of a democrat
uh buying into that argument
right so this will be my impression of a
democrat listening to that argument and
and buying into it sounds good all right
so biden says
uh the polls say jack
listen jack
the polls say
92 percent of democrats would vote for
me if i run again
and now my impression of a democrat
buying that argument
the whole sounds right
i mean how dumb do you have to be
to think that this brain dead uh
is your best chance
all right well this gives me to uh an
awkward place with my audience
now remember
i remind you that you don't watch this
live stream because you agree with me
am i right i guess that part you might
agree you don't watch it because you
agree with me you you watch it because
you might hear something different
and you know that might make you you
know like improve your own opinion it
doesn't have to match mine there's no
requirement there
but it might improve it just by seeing
what the opposite argument looks like
here's my argument that uh well and and
i tweeted today that i owe the public a
firm opinion on this
and the reason i owe the public this is
because uh
i have publicly supported trump
as president
for so long
that i i think i have a public
obligation to give my current opinion
and my my public opinion
is firm i can't support
anybody that age for president
so just age
you i know you'd like to talk about you
know his policies and stuff like that
but i'm sorry
i can't i can't support anybody that age
now it'll get interesting if he gets
nominated anyway
trump does
and let's say biden gets nominated
well then i'm going to be stuck
right because i would have two choices
that are unambiguously not
not the minimum requirement for me but
i'd still choose one
you know
under those conditions but i'm not going
to promise you it'd be trump
if the democrats run somebody young
against somebody old
it's going to be a tough choice it's
going to be a tough choice
yeah
gavin newsom if you run gavin newsom
against trump you're really running
republican policies against democrat
policies
at which point i guess you'd be voting
for the policies more than the person
so you know that changes a little bit if
you get to the finals but in terms of
the primaries
i'm not going to support any democrat or
any anybody
any any republican
at a certain age and i think that uh the
medical community needs to help us out
here
you know i don't know who it would be
the ama
what would be the appropriate medical
body that should get together and just
give us just give us a rule of thumb
i don't think it needs to be a law
i don't think it needs to be a
constitutional change
i would just like
i would just like somebody who knows
what they're talking about
to give us a risk related assessment of
what too old looks like for a president
right
now of course there's you know
tremendous individual difference
some people are too old as 65.
you agree with that right
clearly some people are too old as 65.
also
some people are not too old in 80.
it's rare
but we're not talking about
um specific people
we're talking about what is a good rule
of thumb where we should just you know
minimize our risk
and i don't know what that number is but
let the medical community tell us you
know maybe it's 75
and here's here's the pushback to people
you know i didn't want to embarrass
people by tweeting you know doing a
retweet to them
if you're if you're saying to me trump
looks like he's in great shape today
you're not on the same topic
i'm not arguing about today who thought
i was talking about today
so don't give me an argument today
because that's not even the topic if you
can predict what trump will look like in
six years
let's say two years of campaigning plus
four years of office if you can tell me
what trump will be like in six years
well you're you're a psychic
you're a psychic
and i would like to know what else
you're investing in i want to pattern my
life after your accurate predictions
nobody knows what anybody looks like in
six years do you think you know what
i'll look like in six years
in my opinion i'm too old to be
president if i were to run now
so let's say i'd be
67 in office i'd be in my 70s
you know when i yeah it's too old
so
uh
yeah well
if you said that we're voting for
somebody who will be president for three
months i'd say yeah you know today is a
pretty good
indicator of that but not six years
um well i'm not too old by the standard
of the united states i'm suggesting we
change the standard
i'm suggesting we change the standard
now we have gotten away with this right
i think reagan had lost it
but you know maybe his advisors whatever
kept it together it's obvious that biden
has lost it it does appear that his
advisors are you know keeping the ship
afloat so we do have mechanisms to you
know protect a degraded president but
it's not a risk we should
you know willingly put ourselves into
don't willingly put yourself into that
situation
so and stop telling me how healthy trump
looks because you don't know what he
looks like next year much less six years
now
all right
um do you know the most important job of
a vice president
the political part all right the most
important job of a vice president is to
take over if needed
but
if you don't need to take over
you know in the meantime what's the most
important thing politically just
politically that a vice president does
is make the president look good right
the main job of the vice president is to
make the president look good
and i'm going to compliment kamal harris
because every time there's one of these
uh
gaff videos of biden
unable to read the teleprompter or just
saying dumb
within 24 hours they'll be
kamal harris will top it
with her own babel talk
and i'm wondering if that's a
coincidence
it's almost as if the democrats i don't
believe this but it just it looks as if
it looks as if the democrats uh try to
put out a
they put kamal harris out there every
time biden up
because she's even worse she's literally
the only person you could even imagine
that you would put in that job who could
make biden look better
let me ask you the true true question
think of all the vice presidents in the
history of vice presidents
name one other vice president
who could have pulled this off making
joe biden look like a better public
speaker
no
dan quayle
was actually
a little bit better than kamalaris but
that's that's well chosen
well chosen
yeah maybe dan quell
i'll give you dan quail i'll give you
that yeah he was the same situation you
know i i always uh i always made fun of
dan quayle because he was a vice
president's vice president
have you ever heard me make that point
before
right so
let's say somebody runs for president
and they of course reagan so reagan runs
for president he picks a vice president
who is strong
but clearly not reagan's wrong
so that's you know george bush senior
now george bush senior then runs for
president but he's already not reagan
right he's already george bush now he's
got to find somebody that's below him
now below him i mean in charisma
right it's mostly a
charisma you know how how much do people
like him how much would they like that
person to be president instead of you
so
the worst situation for america
is for somebody's vice president to
later run for president because then you
have a vice president's vice president
and you've deluded your talent twice
your perfect situation
is if you have a vice president who
never takes the job and never gets back
into politics
your worst situation
is your vice president goes on to be
president and then picks the vice
president because now you're two levels
of
charisma below and that's what
yeah
uh imagine imagine kamala harris
getting the nomination and having to
pick a vice president
who looks weaker than she does
do you see it yet
if she ran for president
she would have to because of the
contrast principle she would have to
pick somebody that the public said oh
yeah
you know
definitely kamala is the stronger one
but that vice president could probably
do the job too
she would have to pick somebody weaker
than her buddha judge would look
stronger because he at least talks
better
aoc yeah can't pick aoc because she
looks stronger
there's nothing she could do i don't
swallow well
okay he got me
yeah kamal harris could pick swalwell
and he would look weaker
or chef you could you pick adam schiff
all right
well the pope
has said that joe biden's opinion being
pro-abortion
while being a catholic at the same time
is quote incoherence
so
uh now god has
uh indicated he will vote republican
that may be
i don't know if i've taken that too far
but my understanding is that the pope uh
is closer to you know god's opinion than
we are which is you know why you need a
pope
and if the pope thinks that biden is
incoherent on this topic
um it feels like i feel like god has a
chosen republican
i don't know is that is that too far
god talked to the pope
the pope made his opinion
i don't know
just just put that out there
um
see
oh it looks like i just printed my notes
twice and i don't have as many as i
thought i did
what with that
well that apparently is an indication
that the best thing that's ever happened
to you is
somebody paid two dollars uh
to say that
uh l plus garfield better than dilbert
plus jim davis owns you
somebody paid two dollars to say that
garfield is better than dilbert
you know what
that's the kind of criticism i want more
of
if there's anybody else on youtube so
you on youtube they have a feature where
they can pay to have their comments
if does there anybody else there who
would like to me to see a comment about
let's say another comic strip that's
better than dilbert
because i'll read your comment for ten
dollars
for ten dollars i will read your insult
oh let's do this
for ten dollars or more
uh in uh whatever that super chat fee is
if anybody would like me to read their
insult of me
i will read your insult of me without a
comment and i won't even add my own
comment to it
so now i will i will allow you to
for a fee
have me insult myself
with your insult
go
any takers
nothing i'm getting nothing over there
all right you guys need to look at each
other
uh youtube i would like to introduce you
to
locals
locals meet youtube
and i'd like the two of you to work this
out for me
uh well i got a 10 tip with no
with no insult did anybody
all right nothing noise buying it
all right so
say hi to everybody over there
all right that's enough that's enough
that's enough back to me
let's put the attention back on me where
it belongs
all right so i guess there's no takers
but uh
um
yeah it's like comparing cats to the
office
all right so uh those of you on youtube
do you have any questions for me before
i go i'll give you uh
30 seconds see if anything good comes up
the dominion case well let me talk about
that uh i don't know that i don't know
what the update is on the dominion case
the only curiosity i have is there is
there going to be anything in the
discovery there
that would allow somebody to look at
their code
that would that would be
that would be interesting that's the
only thing i care about really
uh no you gotta pay for that comment i'm
not gonna read your burke brethren
comment
that's the deal i mean you can comment
if you want but i'm not gonna read it
unless unless you pay a super chat fee
uh have you got bo what's that mean
please tweet the 12 trump hoaxes to joe
rogan
um
yeah yeah
[Laughter]
should i
yeah
here's the thing
um here's what's stopping me
there's there's sort of a famous person
code
about how
uh let's say i'll say public figures not
famous people there there's sort of a
public figures
sort of a unwritten code
about how much you interact and in what
way
and uh you know bugging joe rogan to do
my content would not be within that
you know reasonable
you know field because i would why
wouldn't i want him to retweet
everything i do
right
why why don't i want all the famous
people i want i know to retweet
everything
so you have to you have to have some
sort of uh guardrails there
and uh you know anybody can follow
anybody on twitter if if joe rogan or
anybody else sees something
um
no i don't think
i'm seeing a comment there i don't agree
with
now
there would be exceptions
you know let's say i knew there was one
person who really could move the the
needle and it was one topic that was my
one most important topic i might do it
but you would you really want to be
sparing about that now people do it with
me as well right
i know lots of public figures and public
figures are often sending me tweets and
asking me to retweet them
and there are a number of people that i
i do retweet on a pretty regular basis
jeff pilkington you've seen me retweet
him a number of times it's because it's
a very high value account
uh one of the things he does which is
interesting is he
he treats both sides left and right
as if they're both valid
[Laughter]
imagine that so if you want to follow
somebody who actually
legitimately
treats both sides like he's just looking
at him objectively and the very few
people do it
follow him so when he sends me something
it's usually in that vein and that's
right in my sweet spot so of course i
retweet it
um there are a number of other people
like that cernovich i retweet a lot
why because when he says something i
think i haven't seen this anywhere
that's important
i don't even know if it's true but if it
comes from a you know credible source
it's worth talking about
so yeah there are a number and anything
elon musk says is public interest you
know so there's some things that i would
uh retweet somewhat automatically if
it's in my wheelhouse for example you
see me retweet um
corey d'angelo's stuff about
school choice
i'm not i'm not an automatic retweeter
of everything he tweets but he's such a
high value high value stuff on
school choice
which i think is the answer to systemic
racism in the long run you got to get
the schools working for everybody or
else you don't really have a decent
country without that
i mean there are two things i i take as
my standard
for how you're doing
for as a country one would be does
everybody have health care
you know in a reasonable way and is
everybody getting educated
well
and we're not
so those are two things which i think we
can't really claim greatness
when those two things aren't working
we can claim we're doing better than
other countries in some areas sure
but you can't ca you can't claim
greatness if you don't have health care
and education for everybody that's not
greatness that's just doing well
that's okay too maybe it's the best you
can do who knows
but it's not greatness
we could be great
that's within our ability
the united states could be great
we're short of it
and by the way there's nothing more
american than saying that you're short
of your standard
if there's anybody not from america who
hears me saying this you're going to say
to yourself hey
are you insulting your own country
no
no here's what you need to know about
america
if i can't on my flag in public
i don't care about that flag
if i can't set it on fire and
you know you face it in public
i don't want that flag
no no i want the one that you can burn
and it gets stronger
i want the country i can criticize and
it gets stronger
that's my country
my country is i get i get to i get to
punch it
if it deserves it
right i get to punch it
so you that's mostly what i do on
twitter is punch things that deserve it
and i like that that's the country i
want to live in so if you hear me say
something about america that's bad
uh that's different than if it's the
president overseas i'm a little
uncomfortable with our president
you know dumping down the country
overseas
that's not the worst thing in the world
but i'm uncomfortable with it
but when you see
a citizen of the country insulting the
country
just know that that's uh patriotic
like that the purpose of it is to fix it
to make it better
so what makes this country great
is that we can attack it continuously
and it gets stronger
we we harden our own country by just
continuous attacks self-attacks you know
that whatever the outside world has to
throw in america
um you know other than nukes i suppose
but there's pretty much nothing that an
outside entity can throw in america that
we haven't already thrown at ourselves
and you know had some practice
tacos
yeah the whole uh jill
let me give a a full uh support for jill
biden in that taco situation
i get that it's fun to make fun of her
for you know what was an inelegant you
know ill-advised
speech or something
but let's be serious
jill biden doesn't have any bad feelings
about anybody i doubt
so so
give her a break
that's just not where you we shouldn't
spend any time on that
that that story we should have been a
zero
should have been a zero because really i
don't think there are any hispanics are
going to say oh i'd change my vote
because she said that
taco thing
yeah
she's she's a phd doctor
i don't punch i pull
interesting
do you think trump would meet with putin
to discuss ending the war oh that's an
interesting question
well there's no way that can happen with
a democrat
with a democrat and i don't think it
could happen with her with a democrat
president and there's no way it could
happen with a republican president
because they wouldn't want to give up
that power to you know trump now i don't
think i don't think it can happen i
don't see a way there's a path to that
all right um carrie talked to iran and
shouldn't have
well
right here
but i do hate mondays scott and dilbert
are great well thank you
somebody actually paid to compliment me
that's that was unnecessary but
appreciated
uh dennis rodman meeting with putin
worth a shout
all right
that's all for now youtube i'll talk to
you tomorrow
