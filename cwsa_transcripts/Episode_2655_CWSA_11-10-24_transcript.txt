you need more than a picture of two cats
getting ready to watch the show there it
is these two cats watch my show every
day with their wonderful
owner so every day I get to see how
they're lined up to watch the
show that way I don't have to get a cat
of my own I just look at them on
pictures all right we're going to put up
some comments here and before you know
it
we're going to have the show of all
[Music]
shows good morning
Paul good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human
civilization this might be the best time
you've ever had in your whole life but
if you'd like to take this experience up
to levels that nobody can understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need is a cuper mug or glass a
tankered shell or Stein a canteen juger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip go
oh digging deep for that one
oh sometimes you like it sometimes you
need
it all right so how many of you watched
Saturday Night Live or saw the
clips in which the cast tried to deal
with the issue of Donald Trump being
elected
president and uh it apparently took all
the humor out of them they're having a
tough time with it
so it doesn't look to
me like they're going to be too happy um
Bill bur was the uh was the special
guest what you call it the host of the
show and uh gotta say he didn't land at
this time so it's difficult watching
them try to adjust um and you get the
feeling that they don't they don't get
it yet it's like Saturday night hasn't
figured out that it's the
majority and that they have some more
thinking to do but they'll get
there there's a company uh let's see
it's called
ihmc they've got a robot they're making
NAIA that can open
doors so it can play pingpong and it can
open
doors that's really all I
need I I feel like I'm ready to make the
plunge and get this robot
what can it do it can open a door cool
and it can play
pingpong do you know that's more than
most of my friends can do I mean they
can all open doors well most of them but
not many of them can play pingpong you
put those two things together and I'm
like H I think I just made a friend I've
got a ping pong table sitting in my
garage and I'm just waiting to find
somebody who likes ping pong as much as
I do
to use that thing I need a pingpong
robot like actually
legitimately no joking no hyperboy if I
could buy a robot that could open a door
to Simply go where the ping pong is and
go recharge itself when it's done and it
could play
pingpong I would buy that right now it
doesn't need to do anything else I don't
need it to talk to me I don't need it to
tell me the weather just play ping pong
anyway according to Robo daily there's
another robot that uh is
learning by uh observing people
cleaning so they have a human using a
sponge to clean a sink and then the
robot will generalize that skill to
cleaning pots and pans and stuff now
here's my problem with this
story this story was today do you know
how long ago it was the first time I saw
a video of a robot folding laundry and
and it would teach all the other robots
how to fold laundry because once it
could do it they'd all all know how to
do it 20 years
ago I think it was literally 20 years
ago I watched a robot that had been
trained to fold laundry and sure enough
it was folding laundry right in front of
me and then I said well if that robot
can fold laundry it's going to be on the
market any minute now
and there are no robots that can fold
laundry on the market and yet the most
common demonstration we see is robots
folding
laundry and yet there are no laundry
folding robots do you know
why those of you who have worked in the
real world explain to me why if robots
have been folding laundry for 20
years there's no robot folding laundry
I can answer this question while doing
no research
whatsoever there's no such thing as a
robot that can fold
laundry and there never has
been is is there something that you
could put on a on a 20 second video that
looks like a robot can fold a shirt yes
there is yes there is you can totally
make a 20 second video where it'll do it
right once yep you can do that but no if
anytime in the last 20 years any one of
these robots had been able to to
fold a shirt twice you would already
have
it I would have that robot so fast if it
could fold the shirt twice in a row I
mean I could put up with a lot of
expense and I could put up with a lot of
you know okay this shirt's not perfect
clearly robots can't fold
shirts it starting to be like climate
models where it starts out and you say
to yourself huh climate model projecting
the temperature into the future H quite
interesting oh it looks like they can do
it oh look at that they've got a 20-year
accurate prediction of the temperature
in the future huh wow I guess science
can do lots of things and look there's a
video of a robot folding a
shirt no your robot can't fold a
shirt I don't know if it ever will and
if you and if you think I believe that
this robot can play pingpong no I don't
believe the robot can play pingpong I
don't believe anything about any of the
robots let let me just take a stand
every thing you see that a robot
can do is a lie they can't do any of the
things that I I tell you about every day
if they could they'd already be in the
market it's obvious they can't do the
these are they're all in demo mode and
you know they can do three things right
at a 10 or whatever it is but I the the
amount of robot we're going to
see oh look here's a robot that's you
know cleaning a toilet
once all right so enough of my dunky on
robots they had to come in
though there's a according to S poost
there's a big study that says that
there's a big decline in people wanting
to stand
out are you surprised about that that
people are afraid of standing out
has anybody been alive for the last 10
years standing out is a sure way to get
cancelled have you heard to social media
if you stand out you're G to get Savaged
you don't want to stand out yeah no I
get it it used to be that standing out
meant the people in your high school you
know thought you were unique but now
standing out means you can't get a job
like ever because it's on your social
media feed No Maybe maybe uh maybe
there's a really good reason people
don't want to stand out it's just not
safe half of the world will hate you if
you show an
opinion well we we have some reporting
now that Josh Shapiro governor of
Pennsylvania
um is the one who turned down Harris so
if you say to yourself oh that Harris
made a big mistake she should have
picked Josh Shapiro and then she would
have won nope well first of all she
wouldn't have won because she picked
Josh Shapiro it's pretty obvious that
Trump was going to win either way but uh
turns out Shapiro turned her down do you
know what that makes me think of Josh
Shapiro it makes me like him because I'm
thinking to myself oh wow he was smart
enough to know that was a a death trap
it was a death trap it was basically a
political death trap but now he's
keeping his powder Dr and if he wants to
run for president he's fresh and he
turned down Harris and you say to
yourself well I don't like a Democrat
perhaps but he did turn down
Harris so he got that going for
him so so far the thing we know is that
Josh Shapiro is smart uh I'm not sure I
trust him so trust would be a whole
different dimension but he's clearly
smart he's clearly smart
uh do you remember Alan lickman he was
that uh quirky sciency kind of guy who
said he had 13 keys that would
accurately tell you who was going to be
president and it works every
time you remember him and this time he
came out and he showed his 13 keys and
he said it's showing that Harris is
going to win do you remember what I
said I debunked him I said you're not
even interpreting your own keys right
you had 13 things and you could just
look at him and say well you're not even
looking what race are you looking at
you're not even interpreting your own
signals right like obviously like
everybody who looked at it said are is
there something wrong with you your your
own signals are actually pointing the
other way but you're saying they're
pointing this way because there's a lot
of subjective subjectivity in it um and
he uh he was wrong
yeah he was more wrong than us looking
at it and saying huh looks like Trump's
going to
win so there's your science now you
might say to me Scott I thought that you
believed that complex predictive models
always
work no they never work complex
predictive models never work so you
might say to me but Scott it worked 13
out of 13 times until now to which I say
no it didn't if the if the uh signals
were subjective it means that the person
who decided you know what the signals
meant was simply looking at the race and
making a smart decision about who was
probably going to win so probably the
signals had nothing to do with anything
it was probably the most likely
situation is that uh Ellen lickman is
really good at knowing who's going to
win just looking at everything and then
he says oh I'll fit this to my 13 or
whatever it is I'll fit this to my
variables so I've got a feeling that uh
he's just really good at knowing who's
going to win and then he can you know
work backwards to fit it into his model
and make it all look like it made
sense but you know if there were a
million people with a million different
models trying to predict who wins every
time there would be guaranteed a whole
bunch of models that accurately
predicted for 50 years in a row but it
would be like if the penguin leaves its
habitat and turns left that means the
Democrat will win and you'll find out
that the penguin has gotten it right
like 50 years in a row but it's because
there were a million people doing a
million different things to predict the
outcome there's going to be a penguin
that gets it right right if all the
Penguins were involved
you could expect at least one of them
would get it right 50 times in a
row well not 50 times in a row but you
know what I
mean did you hear the tragic story of a
man who killed himself his wife and his
two sons over Trump winning uh Anthony
nephew is his name now that's about as
tragic as you could possibly get but uh
I would like to point out two things
they showed the picture of the the dad
the one who killed the rest of the
family and himself and he had what could
only be called and I'm introducing a new
term MSNBC
eyes you have to see his
picture just look at his eyes and tell
me that you don't see the problem oh
okay so on locals they're already
posting the picture so you can see the
eyes he has MSNBC
eyes do do you know what I mean when you
see uh like Joy Reed talking to Rachel
madow and you look in their eyes and
you're like what is wrong with you two
you look like you have severe mental
illness and then you look at this guy
you go oh I've seen those eyes before
yeah and Miss BC so I do believe that
the eyes suggest that somebody is
existing in this reality but their mind
is concocting a different reality so
very much like the the murderer the
people on MSNBC are simply experiencing
a reality that's not matching the one
that they bodies in and it's got to be
pretty distressing if you're in that
situation this is a genuine
uh major major medical problem so don't
let me convince you that this is a joke
topic it's not these are real people who
are dead and here's what's missing in in
the
story do you know what is not in any of
these stories about this tragic
event who's to
blame now our legal system clearly says
the father who did the killing is the
blame and I understand that but do you
think he came up with these ideas on his
own do you think he was sitting there in
a darkened room and said wait a minute I
think Trump is Hiller I better kill my
whole family cuz it's better for them in
the long run
nope no he was hypnotized brainwashed
subject to
propaganda and because of where his mind
was at which was a weakened state it
looks like he was turned into a murderer
of the worst possible kind his own
family now that is absolutely a product
of media
propaganda would you all agree that
that's a that's a perfectly safe
statement I don't have to be the doctor
I don't have to be his therapist
it's pretty obvious if you killed your
family over
Trump it's because the media told you
something that was ridiculously untrue
so this is on the media and you'll never
see the media say uh oh maybe we went
too far we talked somebody into killing
his whole
family now our as I said our system is
designed and I think this is a good
design it's just nothing's perfect it's
a good design to say that the only
person who goes to jail is the shooter
so I'm I'm not saying you should extend
that to the brainwashers there's just no
way you could make that
work but it is the
story if you're not in court and trying
to put somebody in jail you should be
able to talk about it it's obvious he
didn't get that way on his own he was he
was moved in that direction by uh pretty
evil
forces that's a
story well meanwhile well you know this
RFK Jr wants to get rid of the fluoride
in our water sources says he'll do that
right away Trump has not weighed in on
that except to say he's open to that
conversation basically so Trump's open
to it but he doesn't sound like he's
looked into it much now the hill does a
little story about this
and it never shows both sides of the
topic and I thought to myself how can
you do how can you do a story that RFK
JR says the fluoride's
dangerous but other people say it's not
dangerous and then the only side you
show is a side that shows it's not
dangerous don't you think so the the
only thing that they uh smear Kennedy
with is that it's true that if you had
too much fluoride you know much more
than it would be in our water source
that that could be bad for her health so
everybody agrees if you overdose on it
it's bad for
health but do you think that's what RFK
Jr is talking about do you think that
his concern is the overdose
amount no do you think that there is no
study whatsoever that RFK jors looked at
to decide that fluoride's a bad idea of
course there is why why would that be
mentioned in the article why would the
article only say the World Health
Organization says it's safe
or some other big organizations so
basically you get a story that's says
the the same entities that gave us the
covid pandemic say fluoride's perfectly
safe and then I'm looking for the part
where the part you expect to find is but
RFK Jr has looked at this study and this
study and they indicate you know that
there's a problem so if these studies
are correct then RFK Jr is
correct right
or or or if there are no studies that
show that fluoride in the water is
dangerous they should say that there are
no
studies but all the people who have
studied it say it's safe now that would
be a story that's that tells me oh well
RFK Jr might be a little crackpot then
huh but if you don't say anything about
how RFK Jr came to this opinion he
didn't just sit in a darkened room and
make it
up
again you know it's it's like the guy
who murdered his family he didn't sit in
the darkened room and just come up with
that idea RFK Jr didn't just wasn't
sitting alone one day and think fluoride
it's dangerous and then when he looked
into it it was only massive overdoses of
it were dangerous and then he thought I
think I'll extend this to all fluoride
in the water is dangerous is that what
happened I don't think that's what
happened
so but if you read a you know the
hill just looks like he's a cook but boy
you know once you learn to read between
the lines and see what's missing you
know that's the most the most valuable
skill is to read a story that's about
politics or in the news and just see
what's obviously missing what's
obviously missing is why does RFK Jr
have this
opinion it's a story about his opinion
and they leave out the part why he has
that
opinion that is that's it's the height
of irresponsibility now by the way I
don't have a personal opinion on
fluide do you know why because I keep
reading this story and it never
tells me why RFK Jr thinks it's
dangerous not once not once have I seen
his Source do you think he has no
source of course he has
sources of of course he does but the
news just acts like it doesn't exist now
I don't know if his sources are
good that's that's another story and
worthy of
Investigation well more magic is
happening investor bill akman was asked
on X if he'd ever be interested in
enjoining Elon Musk in the department of
government efficiency and Amman said
yes what
there there's almost so much Golden Age
goodness happening that it's hard to
it's hard to hold it all in my head but
are you kidding me the the level of
Brilliance and capability that's being
attracted to the Trump
campaign I here's what I think is the
magic and I've been saying it forever in
the mainstream media has been telling
you the opposite so it's been hidden for
a few years but now I think the the
answer I think the Secret's out and the
secret goes like
this Trump actually looks to the public
the voters and experts in all Fields
even the ones that might be disagreeing
with the mainstream experts he he has a
very
wide scope of what he's looking at and
then he tries to pick the best ideas out
of it and sometimes makes him fight it
down for Supremacy until you know
somebody wins but I like everything
about that so why would a bill Amman say
yes to this one reason one reason only
because he would
trust that Trump would take good
advice have you ever heard anybody say
Trump refused to take good
advice I've never heard that you would
think that would be a thing that you
would hear you know sort of a natural um
criticism if he didn't
but clearly Trump is taking good advice
from Elon Musk clearly he's taking
advice from you know the vake and
probably Tulsi and you know you you can
see that Trump is absorbing the goodness
from the best people you know the
smartest best most informed most
patriotic people he he's basically a
creature of
their of their creativity at this point
now he's of course you know a unique
character in history there's nobody like
him but he is he's powering up or he's
energizing through the through the
capabilities of some of the most capable
people in the
country so yeah if you can start
attracting somebody like Bill lman to
not just uh endorse him but say he'd
stop doing what he's doing and spend
time on this that's as good as it
gets that that's like this is this is
now the gold standard of how I want my
government to operate yeah let me just
say this here's the gold standard the
gold standard is your President says we
got you know these fa these various
problems one of them is the government
spends too much money then the citizens
say hey I'm uh really good at this how
about I do it for free and I'll go help
you solve the biggest problem there is
can you beat that how do you beat
that that that's that's the government
that beats every other government if the
government becomes a coach where they
can recruit the best players and it's
not about who donated the most or any of
that stuff is just the people who wanted
to join because they're really good at
it yeah Bill Amman looking for
inefficiencies in the system yes please
I'll take that all day long
all right so that's pretty golden Agy
loving
that um apparently climate change didn't
have much influence on the
election now Trump's called it a hoax
and of course the Democrats say it's the
most important thing but my observation
was the Democrats didn't push climate
change is it because they knew it was a
losing
message cuz it cuz I don't know that
it's a losing message Mage it seems like
at least if they want to keep their
base it might be a strong one but maybe
it doesn't get any undecided that could
be the problem now how is that possible
yeah so I think there's a little bit of
a mystery to this is is it true well let
me take a
hypothesis I I think if if we not
experience the the pandemic if we'd
never had the pandemic with all the
lying from the experts I think the
climate change argument would look five
times stronger than it is today but once
we saw that they could lie to us about
our health about a about a needle that's
going in your arm about a mask you're
putting on your face they lied to us
about that and all of them and we saw
that getting 98% of the experts to be on
one side meant
nothing it meant nothing that all the
experts were on the same side and that
really is the only argument for climate
change all the experts are on the same
side now I'm exaggerating it's not all
the experts but their argument was the
you know the largest body of experts
were on one side the pandemic destroyed
that uh there's no argument if your only
argument is the experts seem to be way
you know weighted in One Direction that
ends up rounding to zero it doesn't have
any value in my opinion as currently no
value at all none it's not even slightly
leaning me in that direction it used to
even a few years ago I would have said
well if so many people think it's true
that's got to be worth something and
it's not it's actually worth nothing it
might even be it might even be an anti-
signal where if 98% are saying it but
they can't prove it to you but 98% are
saying it that might be just a signal
it's not true going forward I mean I'm
definitely going to treat it that way
like if I see another one of these well
we can't prove it to you in a way that
you as a citizen would accept that it's
been proven but we all have
bosses and there's one right
answer and we're all we're all saying
the right
answer if you see that situation again
and by the way that's exactly climate
change you know you can't trust it
doesn't mean they're wrong they might be
right this time but you wouldn't trust
automatically so I'm not too surprised
and of course gas prices and the price
of eggs are more immediate than climate
change so it could be nothing but the
immediacy of it versus the the timing of
other
things well Trump is now officially won
all seven swing States he's got
Arizona now what are you going to think
about the system if Trump wins Arizona
but Cary Lake doesn't because I think
she might still be just a little bit
behind in her in her
race would that make you think there's
some some manipulation going
on I think it's possible it's within the
realm of possibility that Trump would
get more votes but given that Carri lake
is correct me if I'm wrong but isn't she
as close as you can get to a female
Trump meaning she's fully on board with
his policies she's a great communicator
you know has the Charisma has the the
power the
energy
um how do you how do you vote for Trump
and then not carry Lake who who exactly
is watching what news that you would
even ever come up with that
idea that you'd take Trump and
then the other
guy I don't know uh depending on the
numbers you know if it looks like it
would have been close no matter what
then we're not going to know anything
but uh if there was one place that I
wanted to see maybe a recount and you
know put the maximum amount of tension
on it and and really for the benefit of
the the
country you know I would prefer the Cary
Lake wins her her uh race so on that
level you know I have a
self-interest but but beyond that don't
you all want to know that the race was
fair and isn't this the one place you
think if I had to look for a
problem I would look here this is the
first place I'd look so I think that the
Republicans need to focus all of their
uh resources there at the moment because
the public needs to know we need to know
so and by the way why do you think there
was no cheating this time or there were
no there were no oversized claims of
cheating you know there were little
things that came up but the according to
uh uh Briana Lyman in the Federalist it
could be and and I'm open to this
hypothesis but I don't think it's
proven that the reason that uh it didn't
look like cheating is that there wasn't
and that the reason that there wasn't at
least in terms of Trump's election and
the reason there wasn't is that the uh
Republicans did such a good job of of
yeah the Laura Trump and the Michael
Watley did such a good job of organizing
the
Watchers now apparently there are a
number of claims and again these are
anecdotal you know maybe you're not
hearing it right but claims that there
were things that the Watchers The
Observers had to fix on the
spot so there was one claim of some
sealed machines that became unsealed and
nobody knew why but The Observers caught
it and so that might be the source there
might be a recount there um there's
other other claims that they were going
to be barred from watching something but
they stopped it they made sure they were
not barred they probably had Watchers
everywhere that a truck might pull up to
a to a landing dock or something I don't
know exactly where they were watching
but if they had figured out all the
places they should be watching and they
watched
that could be the reason that there was
no cheating or no cheating that we have
discovered that is of a scale that would
have made a
difference do you think that's the whole
answer but and do you think
hypothetically and there's no evidence
of this do you think that maybe somebody
had I'm seeing a funny meme go by on the
local site um
all right that was too good that was a
good
meme
um anyway it's possible that there was a
plan to cheat the plan to cheat was
going to kick in at
night and then they looked at the count
and they said oh shoot if we cheat this
much there's no way we get away with it
so it could be there was a plan and it
didn't get implemented not just because
of The Observers which would be an extra
risk but it could be because of the
threats you know Trump and the campaign
were making threats that you're
definitely going to jail if you cheat
that may have made a
difference um and it could be that just
the the natural size of the victory was
so big that the cheaters said oh hold
off hold off we we can't even cheat this
amount it might have been too big to
cheat but we'll never know will we you
know what the other possibility is
the elections were always
Fair anything's possible because I don't
know the answer to why it doesn't look
unfair this time that that's a genuine
mystery to me I'm I'm of course leaning
toward my preferred recreational belief
that it's because the the the
Republicans did such a good job of
watching any place that could have been
a problem I'd love that to be true you
that's that's my preferred explanation
but you know what I can't rule
out that they've always been they've
always been fair and
accurate I can't rule it out it it's not
likely it doesn't seem likely in our
real world to me it seems like anything
that can be cheated that has so much at
stake will be
cheated it just seems to me obvious it's
true of every system everywhere all the
time through all of human history so why
wouldn't it be true in this case but
maybe anything's
possible anyway um according to Fox News
survey more than half of Harris voters
want to relocate because Trump
won well that's better than killing your
family but um I don't think any of them
mean it they might mean it at the moment
but they don't really mean
it but at least there's one thing that
uh the country can agree on cuz the
Republicans are saying wait you want to
leave the
country uh
okay uh can I open the door for you can
I buy you a ticket so finally
Unity Democrats want to leave the
country Trump supporters are saying
sounds good to
me unity all right so as you know
there's a there's a fight going on for
who's going to be speaker of the house
and I want to teach you something about
reputation you know your reputation is
so important to you in ways that you
don't realize until maybe years have
gone by but here's where reputation
really makes a difference the I guess
there were three people who were sort of
on the short list that might be picked
as the speaker of the house and I didn't
know much well I didn't know enough
about any of them um was it
th and Corin and Rick
Scott so I said to myself all right well
who am I going to trust so I thought I I
could think of several people that if
they said one of them was the good
choice that I would have just said all
right I I trust
you but the first person I saw who
endorsed that made a difference was Rand
Paul and Rand Paul is down for Rick
Scott
and here's where
reputation is
important I'm
done I'm
done it's Rick Scott do you know why
because Rand Paul said he'd pick Rick
Scott that's where reputation matters so
Rand Paul by being Rand Paul and never
being anybody but Rand Paul for however
many years he's been around and he'll
he'll he'll walk in to
trouble if he needs to he'll vote
against your ass if he needs to he'll
say the unpopular thing if he needs to
but every time he talks he still ran
Paul and that's a good thing so I have
so much respect for his opinion and he's
obviously closer to all the people that
when I see him um endorse I don't really
treat Rand Paul's endorsement like I
would
treat some other Congress person I treat
it like it's I'm looking at the truth
because that's what he's offered us he's
offered us the truth for years so I I'll
just take your opinion Rand Paul you you
earned that so Rick Scott I don't know
much of anything about him but if Rand
Paul says he's the one to pick of those
three I'm on board so let's see if we
can make this happen if anybody has an
alternate alternative opinion I'll
listen to it but uh I I just
appreciate that somebody could put their
life on the line ran Paul literally puts
his life on the line for the country you
know got has been attacked twice and uh
his credibility is now so high that I'm
willing to just take his opinion on who
to pick for a speaker of the house and I
don't feel like I even need to research
it but if if you have something that's
important let me
know all right
I saw some random Democrat on X say that
uh he was mad at Trump and said that
Trump will be taking away hundreds of
millions of people's basic rights and so
I
said like
what H how are there still people who
think Trump's going to take their basic
rights now of course they come up with
things like a uh an abortion ban but
Trump has said clearly and
unambiguously he does not want a
National Abortion ban indeed not only
does he not want an abortion ban but
when he talked about uh Florida's law he
thought it was too
restrictive so do you really think he's
for a national ban when he thought
Florida's law was too
restrictive he wanted more you know he
wanted a longer time for the woman to
still be legally able to get an abortion
so h where did they come up with these
ideas that Trump would change his mind
from he's always been a little bit of
abortion in some cases is good he's
always been that he's not going to
change his mind on
that but you know they worry that he
would
um and and what else is there what other
rights is he taking away then they then
they throw in you know birth control and
IVF and stuff and Trump's completely on
their side with all of that oh has been
what exactly is the rights they're
taking away from do do they just say
that but they don't have anything in
mind that do they really think he's
going to round up the the uh the people
who just voted him into
office Trump just got the you know a
historically Sensational amount of uh
minority I'm not even sure if it's
minority anymore but uh you know black
voters and Hispanic voters he's the guy
who's going to round up the same people
who just voted for him how does anybody
believe that if anything he's going to
double down on being nice to those
groups do you know why because they just
voted for
him of course he
is all right so
uh I would love to see what the argument
is that he's taking away rights I I
think they talk about abortion and maybe
it went you know the fact that he sent
it to the states is such a good argument
that is not about him
anymore I don't know what they're up to
there's a Yale psychologist according to
the Daily wire who's saying it may be
essential for kamla Harris voters to cut
off Trump voting family members for
holidays it was
essential so Yale you University chief
chief Psychiatry resident Dr Amanda
Calhoun uh made remarks on MSNBC Joy
read show of
course you may have to cut off here all
right so what are you going to do if you
go to your holidays and you have the
anti-trump people in your family and you
know there's going to be a big fight
here's my
recommendation um and here you can model
me they're going to say something like
Trump's going to if they say Trump's a
racist then you point out that he won
more of the you know black and brown
vote of any Republican
ever so which is a pretty darn
good it's a pretty good
argument because what you're saying is
are you telling me that black people
can't identify a racist like onethird of
black people can't even
tell no
one-third of black people not only can
they get an ID surprise but they can
identify a real racist now the fact that
two-thirds of them are voting for
Democrat it's just because that's their
home most people just vote the way
they've always voted so two-thirds
voting one way doesn't really mean
anything but if you can get
onethird of the group that never votes
Republican to suddenly be kind of
Republican that would suggest the
opposite of being a
racist that would suggest that people
were looking at the same thing you're
looking at are saying you know I think
we're going to give this guy a chance
we've seen four years of him didn't
bother us
then but here's your here's the kill
shot here's how to get out of trouble if
your family members say Trump is going
to take away my
rights you ask them which rights they're
talking about and then I suggest to you
you say this if he tries to take away
that right or any of your rights
constitutional rights I will join you
immediately and trying to fight
that because that just takes all the
energy out of
it if you're right I will join your team
immediately and I say that and I mean it
I mean it if Trump if Trump said
something that would take away a right
that is given to you in the Constitution
whatever it is uh I'm out I'm completely
out of any Trump support if he tries to
take away any
rights from Ordinary
People now I'm talking about
constitutional rights I'm not talking
about you know trans surgeries and stuff
like that that's different and a lot of
that is State interest not
federal so you
can join the people who are on the other
side and say you know what I I hear your
worry I think it's because the media
they're the ones that making you think
there is this risk but in the in the
unlikely
event that Trump tries this or tries to
stay in power after his term is over I
promise you I'm on your side we will not
we will not tolerate a third term under
any conditions that's just not the
Constitution and we will not tolerate
the removal of any rights that the
constitution grants you
so now there may be cases where we think
rights should be determined in the
States but that's that's not anything to
do with
Trump people will tend to not be mad at
you if you're agreeing with them so you
can say I agree with you and the moment
you're proven right I'm on your team and
I will fight harder than you will fight
and by the way it is a true statement
that if Trump tried to take away
anybody's constitutional rights he would
be hip checked hard by
Republicans he couldn't get away with
that do you think the daily wire would
be like oh he wanted to take away some
constitutional rights but it's okay
because we like him nope nope do you
think Brit B would be writing glowing
articles if Trump was trying to take
take away any of your constitutional
rights nope not a chance do you think
Fox News as much as you know a lot of
the people on there love him do you
think they're going to back him if he's
trying to take away a constitutional
right if you do then you don't know
anything about Republicans absolutely
nothing it's their basic basic most
important
thing don't mess with our constitutional
rights unless you do it in a
constitutionally appropriate
way anyway you can definitely be on the
same team as the Democrats in terms of
if uh if they're right about Trump being
or becoming a monster just tell them
you're on their side but not until then
until then you want to pursue common
sense all right um according to the
Daily Mail Tom homman who is likely to
be in charge of the Border as he was
before under Trump um he said that Trump
would use the Army to round up and
Deport the worst of the worst illegal
migrants now that's not the arresting
part because the Army doesn't have
authority to arrest people but they
might be transporting them safely and
they might be building some walls and
they might be helpful some
way but uh but homman is talking like
he's he's definitely gearing up to
deport 20 million people now that is the
correct thing for him to say in public
and it is the correct thing for him to
gear up to do because the president got
elected saying he would do that
I will tell you
again that if they go after if they put
most of their resources on the
criminals and it takes several years to
get all the criminals and they build a
wall and they cut down on how many are
coming in the ones who are already here
and if they end up getting jobs because
otherwise they'd probably starve to
death um you're not going to care that
much three or four years you won't care
about the 20 million you'll forget about
it entirely but if the criminals are
gone you're going the the pressure will
be off as long as there's not new ones
coming in
so um I can I can completely agree with
having the messaging not match what I
think is the reality normally I would
want the messaging in the reality to
line up but remember we're trying to
persuade other countries don't come here
so if you're trying to persuade other
countries to not send people here this
is the way to do it this is the exact
way to do it we're going to round up all
20 million of you with our our
military that is the right
message what you actually do with your
military and who you start with and how
far you go that's really a separate
question and I think you can play that
by
ear anyway um so the Trump effect is
definitely strong unless there's a bunch
of coincidences but you probably heard
that qter the country of Qatar as you
call it I call it qar because then it
makes me sound smarter um says that
Hamas is no longer welcome to use their
country as a safe
space that seems like a pretty big
deal then also breb bar news is
reporting that uh the uh European Union
Chief is uh looking to replace Russia
LNG uh gas with American Gas
and apparently that comes after a phone
call with Trump and now if you heard
that story and you said
oh European Union wants to buy more
American Gas instead of Russian gas and
it's because there was a phone call with
Trump now if I hear that story I say to
myself well I'll bet those are not
connected I'll bet it was just you know
Winter's coming they're looking for a
good deal they're buying some more more
of our gas they had a phone call with
Trump so were just trying to connect
these two things that weren't
related turns out they're totally
related and and this is uh so the EU EU
president said uh that that they wanted
to build good relations with the
incoming Trump Administration from the
very beginning and absolutely the
European Union is saying uh we're going
to buy more gas from you because we want
to suck up to you president
Trump they're saying it
directly so you don't even have to
wonder is that a trump effect yep yep
they just said it's a trump effect we're
going to we're going to buy more gas
from you because Trump's your
president Okay add that to the
GDP uh Trump has announced that he would
not be considering for his uh new
Administration Nikki Haley or Mike
Pompeo I think that was pretty smart of
him New York Post is reporting
um and it's not just because I think
they don't fit in his administration
even though I don't think they would fit
I people are talking about it too
much so you know he could just take it
off the table it's a
distraction and I think that was good
because there there was a lot of heated
conversation about those two names and
if he's already ruled them out and I
think that's
fair let's take it off the table would
move uh according to the New York Post
Nancy py isn't two happy with Bernie
Sanders and you know Bernie criticized
the Democrat Party for not paying
attention to the working class so much
and Pelosi said that she doesn't respect
him for saying that
now do you notice how that answer plays
I don't respect him for saying
that the Democrats don't have any idea
what the problem is do they let me say
how you should say this if you would
like to have unity in the Democrat
Party I don't agree with Senator
Senators but I certainly respect his
ability to you know I respect his
opinion but I don't agree with it in
this case she actually said I don't
respect
him that's the very thing that
Republicans are so triggered by is like
why are you talking about us like we
want to talk about policies and what's
good for the country but you're talking
about us stop talking about us right if
if if there's any person in public who's
you know aligning another human
being uh maybe you should do more policy
stuff we could use that so even even
when they're just talking to each other
they're modeling what they get wrong
which is making it about the
person anyway there's a a lot of after
elction thinking about what went wrong
and what worked and a lot of people are
saying that Trump's
anti-trans uh funding of transitioning
in prisons specifically that his
commercials about that were really
effective do you think that's true or
could be known by the data that we have
do you think think we could even know if
that's the case that those commercials
made the biggest difference because I've
not yet heard anybody who said they
changed the vote because of it I mean I
I do get that it's really visual so
here's here's a sort of a persuasion
lesson there are very few you don't have
to have an actual picture to be visual
if you can make the picture in
somebody's head is visual enough so if
you're talking about prisoners in jail
everybody can picture that really
clearly if you're talking about that P
that prisoner who's clearly looking male
in your imagination and they're asking
for a sex change operation suddenly
you're like you thinking about their
their balls literally and you're
thinking about what they do after that
and you think about oh my God are they
going to be transferred to the women's
prison and so there's this whole movie
that's created in your mind it's all
visual as all dark so it certainly makes
sense
that that kind of message would be
persuasive but on the other hand I don't
think a single person has mentioned it
as a reason for their vote now a lot of
people have said I'm sure other people
were influenced by it but I was already
you know going to vote for Trump but I
think other people were influenced by it
I don't know how would you really
know so I have I would wait on this one
I think it's very possible that it did
make a difference
but I don't know they changed Minds may
maybe it got a few extra people to go
vote I don't know uh so I would be
skeptical of all explanations of what
worked I heard this about the movie
business years ago it always stuck with
me that when if if you make a movie in
Hollywood and it works and everybody
loves it and it's a big hit then all the
critics will say that all the parts were
good so if something's like a great
movie what you never hear is wow it's a
great movie despite the bad casting or
that the costumes were crap but you know
still overall it worked they don't if
something works they say everything
worked casting was great the costumes
the the writing the editing the
producing it was all terrific the sound
man and there's there's some kind of
like a you know a glow to success
um but I think you've got the same
problem with the election Trump won and
he won big like a hit
movie so like the hit movie we look at
everything that Trump did and we say oh
the ads were great his his campaign was
great his messaging was great his
opponent was weak
so if you know it's not true with the
movie and the movie is a pretty good
analogy it's like it's a winning thing
and you think all the components must be
winners too uh I think we don't exactly
know what
happened and maybe we never will it
could be that it was the accumulation of
a whole bunch of
things it could be was it was it was
nothing but the
pendulum we had simply gone too long in
One Direction and the country just said
Ah that's enough that's the pendulum it
could be there was almost no thinking
whatsoever it's just we knew we were
going too far off whatever all of us
thought were normal and we thought we
can't go that far past normal so let's
pull it back a little bit could be that
there was almost no thinking involved it
was just an adjust you know an
adjustment back to the norm could be
and um if if I had
to if I had to break it down and pick
maybe my top three and again this is
conflicting with my opinion that we'll
never know and maybe it was just a lot
of things I would say number
one uh Trump's campaign was about the
best campaign you'll ever seen in your
life unbelievably good and good vice
president just really everything it was
just amazingly good at the same time the
first Biden campaign and then KL Harris
I think one of the
worst so you're comparing one of the
best campaigns and the most influential
candidates of all
time against the worst campaign and one
of the worst candidates of all
time so if you didn't know anything
except you were running the best
candidate of all
time against the worst candidate of all
time you shouldn't have to overthink
that
right do do you need to get into the
weeds well we ran the worst candidate
against the best candidate you mean the
the best ones that could have run this
year yes but also the best and the worst
of all time of all
time
so it's hard to imagine that anything
but cheating Could Have Made It Go in
any other
direction but I will say that the uh the
fine people hoax and having that pop
probably made a big difference I think
that living through the p pmic made
people much more skeptical about
everything I think that the trans stuff
being promoted to the most important
thing that we have to talk about all day
long drove everybody who wasn't trans or
a best friend with a trans person
 crazy
now how many of you wondered why
I who like to talk about all things
politics and the trans thing was one of
the biggest things in the news have you
ever wondered why I talked about it so
little you know unless it was some funny
story or something and and uh I never
like waited into it I would say things
like you know of course I'm not in favor
of it for children but adults can do
what they want to do but beyond that did
you notice I didn't really take a
side didn't really play it too hard
because I like trans people don't have
you know nothing against
trans here's why I'm going through
reveal to you for the first time my
actual deep thinking on the
topic it was
incredible the more the better you know
why because I thought that the more they
concentrated on
trans the less future the Democrats
had because there was no way that that
message was working for the general
public so the longer it went on
the the more the entire structure of
their party was crumbling so that's what
I saw what I didn't need to do was make
it go away you know if I wanted the
topic to go away I would have waited in
hard and said we got to just make this
decision and do it this way no I liked I
liked it being the top story because
every day there was a trans story that
was the top
headline I saw the Democratic party
Fading Into Obscurity and I said how
about a little bit more of that please
yeah let's push that and then when it
went all the way to transitioning in
prison that the public was
ready because they they'd all already
been primed by even if they were
protrans and I'm
protrans we spending too much time on it
it's a pretty small group and although
we should treat everybody you know with
empathy and
Humanity uh it's a small group we were
all ready to move on we needed that
reason though we needed something about
the topic that everybody could say
that's too far and when KL Harris
offered up we're going to do free trans
surgery for
prisoners then everybody normal said
there it
is there you go that's too far now I can
tell all of my friends including my
trans friends
that that's too far you could you can
even tell your best friend who is trans
okay I don't agree with the prison thing
that's too far and you wouldn't feel
embarrassed about that even if your best
friend was trans right it's a whole
different situation it's about how you
spend your money at that
point well anyway the the woke thing was
ready to crumble under its own weight
and uh I didn't know it was going to
happen this election but I but I did
know
that the pronoun thing would go
away like you could know with a great
deal of certainty that the weird pronoun
thing wasn't going to be a 20year
problem it might be a 10year problem but
it's not going to be a 20-year problem
we're we're not going to put up with
that too long and sure enough um I
don't think I've had a single pronoun
situation in my life it's never once
been an issue if if it ever did and
somebody said call me this or that I'd
be like sure whatever cuz it's just such
a non-issue in my
life um but San Francisco mayor London
breed uh I can't remember if she lost or
got recalled and then the Oakland mayor
lost or got recalled so two of the big
uh problems in my local area got taken
out as along with two Soros prosecutors
one in my area my County up here and one
in LA
those are big big
Corrections big big big Corrections for
here now um California is often sort of
a a warning shot for the rest of the
country you know the things that happen
in California are they're going to
Ripple through the rest of the country
but it might be a few years later you
know it seems like everything happens
here first and if you see California
just saying
uh this is crazy we can't do this
anymore then you could feel fairly
confident that that's the end of it in
other words it's the beginning of the
end of it so uh I could not be happier
about the direction of things right
now meanwhile the Democrats are in chaos
and here's my take on that so they they
don't have a a leader they don't have a
they seem to all be pointing fingers at
each other it's a circuit firing squad
as they like to
say but here's what you
assume don't you assume that oh you know
a year from now they'll be they'll be
back organized and you know they'll have
somebody in charge and you know maybe
Nancy Peli will retire and then there'll
be a you know strong new leader and
he'll he or she will pull everybody
together and and then the Democrats will
be back and they'll put up a good fight
I'm going to go contrarian on this
they have created a system that they
can't recover from which is unique uh
almost anything else you could recover
from here's how they can't
recover if they keep making things about
identity they will lose again everybody
everybody there so far if they keep
hammering
identity they will just keep going down
in power because it just didn't work and
it's not going to start working so
identity as as their main mechanism
definitely definitely will keep them in
the losing position forever but suppose
they go the other
way suppose they drop identity to focus
on let's say the working class what
happens then well then they definitely
lose do you know why because they've
trained their base that identity is the
most important thing so they train they
train their base that identity has to be
their primary thing and they also proved
that it will make them lose
forever there's no path
back there's no there's no path
back if they go if they go identity
first again they lose
forever and if they try to change it
their base will object because they've
been brainwashed and that their identity
is their main thing there's no way
you're can un-brainwash them fast enough
I I think think the Democrats have taken
themselves out
of essentially out of power for 20 years
I mean I don't know how long it would
take before the people who think
identity is the most important thing
literally age out and
die but probably that's what's going to
happen you they probably the Democrats
will probably have to wait for a
generation to die or to grow older and
get smarter or come up with something
but there is no way out they they've
created the ultimate self
trap right now because you can't really
think of anything else that would act
that
way you could take any policy that maybe
if you ran an election and you lost on
let's take
abortion so the way the way Republicans
handled abortion
forever um probably hurt them but when
they finally got their way and moved to
the states probably hurt them at least
in 2020
but they were quite wise and knowing
that eventually it would take that issue
off the table federally and I think it
did I think I think their plan worked
perfectly so you can see a case where
somebody could lose maybe one election
or
two but there's an adjustment that's
there they can they can change how
they're dealing with abortion without
really changing their values they're
just changing the system preference so
that's a change you can make and a
productive one but there's no way the
Democrats can escape from their identity
trap that they made for themselves they
either push it and lose or they abandon
it and
lose no other way
out well I think the Republican party is
going to get a lot
bigger anyway um and also the half of
the republ half of the Democrat Party is
committed to impractical policies I
think we have to say that right a full
half of the Democrat
Party are committed to impractical
policies leaving the Border
open for example uh Equity
reparations public schooling without uh
a private option or any kind of
competition these are just plainly bad
ideas just plainly bad ideas it's not
like just I prefer this this way or I
prefer it's not even a preference it's
just bad versus good and that's uncommon
because most things are actually a
preference like oh i' I'd like to spend
a little bit more if I get better health
care that's a preference it's not a bad
idea or a good
idea all right here's some more good
news for the country in the Golden Age
um you know there's going to be a lot of
backstabbing and fighting over at maral
Lago as people jockey for position to
get you know cabinet positions and stuff
like that but
uh if you know Bill P and I think most
of you do you know know Bill P um he's
the grandson of the P who built P homes
he's not directly involved with P homes
now he's uh doing his own thing but uh
he would be the most
qualified most perfect HUD head you
could have Housing and Urban
Development oh my God he he would be the
whale that we need for that position in
fact it'd be hard to imagine anybody
else is even a close second because he's
got all the building experience he's a
rock solid on you know good solid fit
with Trump you know he would fit
perfectly they know each other they like
each other so they would get along
personalities would work he would be out
of the box he could talk to Trump about
building and Construction in a way that
Trump would
understand let me explain it this
way imagine Ben Carson in HUD where he
was in the first Administration then
imagine Bill
P now imagine the conversation with
Trump Ben Carson comes in with his
medical background and says uh I think
we should do this or that and Trump
who's an experienced
Builder is like not really in the same
domain for the conversation now imagine
Bill P walking in with a some blueprints
he says Hey I want to build a freedom
City you know one of one of the Trump
Freedom cities that that are considered
and just shows him a plan and then
Trump's like okay because he looks at
plans he's like well about use you know
less steel more concrete oh we could do
that what about uh what about we build a
bring in you know a nuclear power plant
to to drive this new city yeah we could
do that so if you just imagine the
conversation between two people who
understand uh the construction building
housing world and they're both on the
same side they want the GDP to grow they
want to build build build you know build
baby and do it right and cheap and you
know bid for things and I have a bunch
of corruption it's basically
everything right if you really want the
the housing prices to come down the jobs
to go up the construction to go
up p is the obvious choice so I don't
know who else is running for it but if
you if you tell me there's somebody more
qualified or more perfect really for
this job than Bill P
Trump should be begging him to take that
job I don't know if he's interested but
if he I I think he might be so if he's
interested in the job uh the Trump
people should be begging him because let
me let me put it in the starkest way I
think Bill P at HUD is 1 to two% of the
GDP that's how big it is if you put the
wrong person there it's zero it was Zero
they they'll add nothing if you put the
right person
there construction takes off like we've
never seen it and and you're talking big
big big money because the construction
affects you know so many other things
it's like it's huge ripple
effect and then if what you can build
are cities that lower the cost of
living look at the size of that wind
imagine if one of the Cities I I've
always fantasized about this imagine if
one of the cities is for people who
can't get
ahead so they're working as hard as they
can they've got a job no problem getting
a job but they just they can't save
money they're let's say they're it's two
teachers so they both got good jobs
they're teachers but you put them all
together and you add a couple of kids
and they just just can't get enough for
a house payment or a house down payment
so suppose you built a city and you say
we've got this temporary City for people
who want to come live here for five
years build up a little wealth and then
go wherever you want so you go to a city
where like everything's super cheap but
you can still be a teacher you still get
the same pay but your housing is you
know $900 a month instead of 4,000 a
month or something crazy and uh you just
save some money five years later you've
got 100,000 in the bank and you put it
on a down payment and you go somewhere
else so so I can think of probably 12
different ideas for U small cities you
know one my my other favorite one is
build it around a small nuclear power
plant and and then make the city a part
owner of the plant so in other words if
you live in the small town you also
become automatically a stockholder in
the nuclear power plant so so your taxes
go down to zero because the nuclear
power plant is serving your
town but also serving the nearby town
maybe and just charging them for it
so you could imagine lots of ways that
you could start from scratch as if
nobody hadd ever built a town or a city
before and say how would you do it if
you started from
scratch all right um I also think you
could probably get a lot of billionaires
to build a city I'll bet you there's a
bunch of who if you said to him how
about you build a
city I'll just pick one uh let's say
Mark Benny off
Salesforce um I I like to pick him
because I had enough of an interaction
with him that he just impressed the hell
enemy you know he didn't get
lucky he he didn't build Salesforce
because he got lucky right he he's got
really the whole set of skills but if
you go to somebody like him who is
really interested in you know the larger
good of community and say how how about
you take a shot at a city you know put
your best ideas on it hire your best
designers um let's say you want to build
a city that's great for whatever let's
say the working class how would you do
it here's some federal land if you come
up with a plan we'll approve it and you
can build a city you can make a profit
on it or not make a profit you go either
way but you get to test out your idea of
how a proper City should be designed
I'll bet you you could get a bunch of
billionaires that would say yeah I'll
build a small one and if it works out
we'll expand
it I think the new city thing could be
the future of the country really we
should be building a country that
everybody wants to visit because our our
water and our air is clean and our food
is healthy we don't have that yet but
we're working on it and that the cost of
being here is reasonable and the people
are living in nice homes and there's no
garbage and people on the
streets anyway did you see the story
about the uh
FEMA um person who put out some a
written instruction during the hurricane
Devastation recently that uh the FEMA
people should not knock on the door of
people who had Trump signs in other
words they
were officially not unofficially but
officially somebody in Fimo was
instructing people to not help Trump
supporters in an
emergency now you might say to yourself
being fired isn't
enough because if you're leaving some
people in an
emergency I don't know if there's some
law against that but it seems like at
least racial discrimination or something
I don't know feels like it should be
illegal I don't know what law it would
be broken but uh anyway anyway the
person responsible for that did get
fired but here's my problem with
it again of course the person who does
the ACT has to be the one who's
responsible from a legal perspective no
doubt about that but don't the media
brainwashers have to have some
responsibility for that because again
the person who works for FEMA did not
sit in a darkened room all by herself
and say I've got an idea how about uh
were bad to Trump supporters that didn't
happen this is somebody who watched the
media and got brainwashed into thinking
that Mega Trump supporters were so bad
that you could let them die in an
emergency so you could save the other
people now she didn't come to that idea
on her own that was a media collectively
media message
and you don't see the same thing
happening the other way do
you imagine a world you can't you can't
even hold this in your imagination watch
I'm going to tell you to imagine
something and watch you can't even do it
you won't even be able to do it imagine
the uh situation were reversed and there
were female people telling people not to
help uh people who had Democrat signs in
their house I can't even imagine
it right
because there's nothing happening on the
the right leaning media that would tell
me I shouldn't rescue my Democrat
neighbor like
what nobody's saying anything like that
and we are saying that you know Harris's
policies could destroy the country and
you know we have strong
feelings but not any of those feelings
are telling me that there that I'm not
going to save my neighbor
how like how brainwashed do you have to
be before you think that's okay that you
can put it in writing she put it in
writing don't save Mega people it's in
writing now there's a difference right
and I don't think the difference is you
know there are more crazy people on one
side even if there are the real
difference is the
brainwashing there's just nothing like
this happening on the other side and
when the Democrats try to make some kind
of equivalent you know they do the
things likew you called us garbage so
that's no worse than calling Trump
Hitler to which I
say uh those are completely
different if garbage is the problem I'll
pick up the garbage if Hitler's the
problem I'm going to kill Hitler if I
have a chance right to imagine that
those are somehow in the same domain is
is just crazy just more crazy eyes
anyway so that's my uh thoughts for
today for this Sunday I hope you hope
all the other podcasters are having fun
sleeping in and not working hard unlike
me who is here every single day for you
to keep you
sane now let me ask you this how many of
you have an overall better feeling now
that the election appears to be over at
least over enough have any of you felt
that you're just your overall quality of
life somehow went up your optimism maybe
your patriotism maybe your sense of
hope I felt all of
that I I felt
like I tell you what I said this
yesterday but I could feel a connection
all the way back to
1776 I felt that time and space
collapsed and and that that time and
this time were just the same
time and the fact that our Founders
created a system that could self-correct
and boy were we worried that it couldn't
because because the you know the
Democrats had stretched reality and
stretched good common sense to the point
where it looked like it was broken and
maybe it couldn't be fixed and Not only
was it fixed but it was fixed by almost
everywhere
almost at the same time meaning that
every demographic group seemed to be
leaning toward Trump for a
solution how does how does all of that
get activated at the same time is it
just that he ran a better campaign and
she didn't I don't know I I feel like
the results of the election were baked
into us before the candidates were
announced meaning that I think the
country was done with what the Democrats
were offering which was nothing but
non-stop fighting and identity politics
and we were just over
it because it doesn't really match the
real world in the real world I don't
really have many identity related
anything do you except for being turned
down for jobs or something it doesn't
come up I mean if if there's a you know
a party where I live oh and here here's
something I don't think I've ever told
you
directly if have you ever
wondered sort of uh have you ever
wondered sort of
honestly is it better to have diversity
or or wouldn't it be better you know if
everybody look like you you ever wonder
that
well
um I'm sorry I'm just getting some
messages coming in they're
distracting um here's something that
should make you feel good so where I
live in Northern California um you would
not be surprised to learn that I live in
a town that has a pretty good income and
good
schools we're also quite
diverse um but not just diverse in black
and white we're more internationally
diverse so if you watch you know if
you're picking up your kid at the school
and you're watching the you know as I
have a number of times and you're you're
watching the other kids walk by in the
sidewalk it looks like the United
Nations I mean it's just one of
everything you know and it's not it's
not just you know Asian or it's not just
Hispanic it's you know Middle Eastern
it's it's just everything
and so that's my reality like every
interaction every you know event every
party any any situation where I live is
going to look like the United Nations
and it's freaking
awesome now if you'd said can you
predict how this would be in advance I
don't know if I would have predicted
it's awesome but do you know why it's
awesome there's one reason there's
exactly one reason that diversity works
really well
here High incomes
everybody's doing okay you know in
general obviously not everyone's doing
okay but in terms of
groups you know the The indian-americans
Who live here usually you know tech jobs
doing great asian-americans doing great
Hispanic Americans doing well above
average um everybody's doing great now
that's just because I live in a upscale
neighborhood so here's the key takeaway
if you think that people are at each
other because of
identity all you have to do is live in
my neighborhood for like a year and you
realize the identity wasn't anything
it's the
income if you have the same income and
often same you know level of you know
education whether you got it on your own
or any other way we all get together we
we all get along right right so if my
neighbor who is really smart and has
figured out
life uh is chatting with me it doesn't
matter who they are we're completely
connected by just that life experience
so do not be
confused by any this identity doesn't
get along with this identity it's
usually just
income you know it's just just income
and my neighborhood is the proof of that
all right so if we all make more money
and we're all better off
um and that's all I got I'm going to
talk to the locals people just for a
minute and uh privately so thanks for
joining on X and YouTube and Rumble uh
locals I'm coming at you privately in 30
