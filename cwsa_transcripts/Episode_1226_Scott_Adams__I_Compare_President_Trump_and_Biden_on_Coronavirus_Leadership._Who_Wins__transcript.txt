hey everybody
come on in it's time time for
coffee with scott adams the best time of
the day
every single time and
what do you need yeah if you'd like to
take this up a level
all you need is a copper mug or glass a
tanker chalice or steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and you're gonna have it right now go
ah feel
the connectedness you know
we're often separated by
country type and ethnicity we're
separated by
gender and age and all kinds of things
but one thing that brings us all
together it's the simultaneous sip
and it's pretty awesome speaking of
awesome
although there's a tragedy involved
united
airlines had a situation where a coveted
passenger died in flight and
as the coven passenger was gas i guess
stop breathing uh there were actually
multiple people who volunteered to help
uh do cpr just just hold this in your
head for a moment
we're in the middle of a pandemic and
somebody has symptoms that
certainly look like they could have been
coronavirus you know because it's a
breathing problem
and indeed it was confirmed it was real
coronavirus
and yet and yet
there were multiple people who
volunteered with their
hesitation to perform cpr now in this
case the cpr did not include
mouth-to-mouth because they have oxygen
masks
so it's more about the compression but
one of those people was
uh tony aldappa who's a young man who's
uh
i guess he was an emergency emt type
happened to be on the flight and he
jumped in
used his expertise with no hesitation
performed
cp cpr on the guy for a long time was
by his own report by tony's own report
he was covered in the man's sweat and
urine
by the time he was done and indeed
tony also it looks like got coronavirus
so he did actually get the exact risk
that he knew was the risk when he didn't
hesitate
and he says now he would do it again now
of course he's a younger
man so his risk of dying tony's risk is
lower than
than the patient so statistically the
odds were in his side
but how do you like how do you like
living in a world
in which you can be in the middle of a
pandemic
and you go down on an airplane and there
are
like several people come to your rescue
several it's pretty inspiring
another story uh trump um is actually
mulling reportedly he's asking people
about uh
reprising the apprentice
now i'm not a big tv watcher so i don't
have an opinion about whether that'd be
good tv but
it would be the top-rated show
so if trump wants to have the top-rated
tv show
he can do it but it's a it's a sort of a
weird
career situation for trump because he
could also have the top rated at
anything
basically you know whatever business he
starts is probably going to do pretty
well if he chooses right
so he's got a lot of options
steve malloy tweeted a cartoon
uh from the washington post that was
depicting uh trump supporters as rats
yeah does that sound familiar so it's a
cartoon
depicting trump supporters as actual
rats
you know physical rats and
it might sound familiar to people of a
certain age because
as steve pointed out in a side
side-by-side photo
it's uh nearly identical to nazi
propaganda
now very few people have
mocked people more than i have
for using any kind of holocaust analogy
or nazi analogy and the reason i mock
people who do that is that
the whole reason that you know the
holocaust
is so big in our minds
is because it was a one-off well
one office unfortunately that's too
optimistic it's it's something that
doesn't happen a lot
let's just say unfortunately it wasn't
unique
that there was a massacre but
usually i say to myself wow you know
calling an american politician
hitler that's that's not
you know right that's just hyperbole
it's stupid you're just not
you know a good part of the conversation
but this is the first time i've ever
i seen an exact match
the the uh the type of communication
that the washington post
was using with this car cartoon of the
trump supporters as rats
is exactly the same as nazi propaganda
showing the jewish population as rats
before world war ii it's exactly the
same
there's no difference
that is so shocking that i don't even
know how the washington post stays in
business after that
i mean the whole the whole company
should have been shut down
after that like this is so bad you
actually should have shut down the
company
but you know there's no law against it
so there's no way you could actually
shut down a company over a comic but
this is in terms of how bad it is
it's a close the company kind of bad
this isn't oh sorry this doesn't run a
correction
or run an apology kind of thing this has
closed the whole company
you don't deserve to be in business
because you are a menace to society
if if you're a uh news organization
uh well i've said enough on that um
today i don't know if you can take the
excitement but i have it's a double
whiteboard day
but it's not just a two-sided whiteboard
day
but the two sides are two different
topics how about that
how about that it's not even the same
topic topic number one
the integrity of our computing systems
in the united states
whoops don't want that side
don't look don't look that's the wrong
side no don't look
i hope you enjoy my super high tech
presentation
which if you're listening to this on
audio is really annoying
so um all right topic one the integrity
of our computing systems in the united
states we found that
with the solar winds hack that uh is
probably
russia our experts say trump says
might be china it might be but the
pompeo and the intelligence agencies are
saying it's
probably russia how should how much
should you
trust our intelligence systems who say
it's
probably russia what
what what level of credibility would you
put on
all of our intelligence agencies being
quite certain
quite certain yeah zero zero
zero is what the credibility i'd put on
it i'd put zero on that
now that doesn't mean they're wrong but
in terms of
whether you could believe them or should
believe them based on recent history i'd
say zero
you know they gave us russia collusion
so if they give you that they can give
you anything
but here's our situation
we know that foreign hackers have gotten
into
uh pretty much a lot of our
critical systems but one element of this
particular hack
is that you can't really tell if you got
hacked or not
that's that's built into the nature of
the hack
is that you wouldn't really know you
were hacked
so i don't use the word hacked
uh for this graphic i use the word
compromised
so compromised just the way i'm going to
be using it for this
means that you don't know if you're
secure or not so that's different from
knowing you're hacked
rather you just don't know you might
have some bad software in there
you might not but i want to give you the
good news
i don't want to dwell on the bad so we
know that whether
we have confirmed a hack or worse we
simply know that
might have been because it's compromised
pretty much
all of our major systems with one
exception
have been compromised and again it
doesn't mean hacked
it just means we don't know if it's
hacked so therefore it's
compromised in that sense but the only
one that isn't
is our election systems which is not one
system but rather it's a
constellation of different systems but
i'll just represent it with one
circle here so all of our other systems
in the united states
we know are compromised which doesn't
mean hacked it just means it might have
been except for the election systems
so we we have a good solid election
system and
i think you'd have to chalk it up to
luck
because all of these systems that are
compromised
have just as good security
as this one system there wasn't
in fact some people would argue that
it's kind of ironic
because the one system that seems to be
kind of weak on security
if you were just sort of looking at it
from the outside
i don't think the companies would say
that i think the companies would say
they have good security
but looking at it from the outside i say
to myself
it doesn't look so good to me but i'm
not really a professional in that area
so i'm going to say the the companies
that manage these systems are
correct and that their computer security
is
the best because just look at this
every one of these other systems is
either confirmed to be hacked
or might have been might have been you
don't really know
but not the election systems and the
reason i know this is because this is
this is what the news says and if you
look on social media
even if you were going to uh let's say
you're crazy
if you just hypothetically let's say you
are actually mentally insane
and you started thinking i think the
election
may have been hacked and our software is
not secure so if you're insane like that
and obviously that would be
clinically insane if somebody said
something like that um
you would be uh actually chastised on
social media
because even to say that
this one is also compromised
i mean how can you even think that
that's
that's a little woohoo you know well
it's true that
all the other systems are compromised
whether they've been hacked or not
through compromise but this one wow
first rate so that's the good news i
like to focus on the good news
you you watch the news and they'll be
like oh people died you know
negative stuff pandemic but you come
here for the optimism and
i'm here to tell you it looks dire with
all these
these hacks and these compromise systems
but thank god
our election system is not part of that
mess
thank god and i'm going to take it
further
the the people who manage the election
systems
are not just better than the rest
because they're the ones who don't have
compromise systems
they're not just better but i think
they're patriots really
and i've got a little tear of my eye
because
you don't really see this kind of
patriotism often
especially from people who might
be citizens of other countries so you
don't see as much american patriotism
from citizens of other countries but
for our election systems they're
completely american patriotic
and i would you join me
just i think we should give a little
applause for our election systems
everybody else failed us this year they
all failed us
but not our election systems
so looking on the bright side
speaking of the bright side congress has
finally it looks like they're going to
have some kind of a coronavirus
stimulus deal and
isn't that good news i'm going to here's
some more good news
the coronavirus stimulus bill that our
congress which gets a lot of congress
gets a lot of criticism when you say
is that too strong a statement that
congress gets a lot of criticism it's
true
people are criticizing congress all the
time and unfairly i think
because just look at the stimulus deal
here's here's a deal that they all
pretty much agreed
on months ago uh
and it only took them what
six months or so to do a bill that they
all pretty much agreed on from the start
so or at least they knew how it would
end from the start
the smart people say so that's pretty
good isn't it
like how how long is a bill supposed to
take i feel like in the
in the context of an emergency where
people are starving to death
six months is pretty fast i mean
let's let's not criticize them for every
little thing
it's just a pandemic it's only people's
entire lives
being destroyed it's just starvation but
six months is pretty fast and i'm not
talking about
something that's easy i mean this is
practically a
warp speed moonshot kind of a thing
and i think congress well congress
today is just all only compliments today
congress
for doing the work of one day in
six months i salute you your patriots
thank you thank you congress for letting
all those people suffer
for six months for no reason at all
but six months still pretty good
pretty good uh in news of um
what would we call this uh wokeness in
wokeness news
uh ida bay wells you may know her
because she was one of i think she was
the principal behind the 16 1619
project in which we are all trying to
learn more
about the founding of our of our country
especially the uh the slavery uh
part of the founding of the country and
so
uh ida bay wells was tweeting
and she said this um it was part of a
tweet thread so it
sounds a little bit out of context but
she was saying uh
she can't get over how people talk
disdainfully about 10 and 11 year old
children
well i didn't know that people speak
distainly
disdainfully about 10 and 11 year old
children
does that happen a lot of your house i
don't
i mean some people talk about their own
kids sometimes but
do people do you hear a lot of
complaining in public on social medias
like
tell you this country's got some
problems
but no problems quite as big as our 10
and 11 year olds
am i right so apparently in ida
bay wells world there's a good deal of
complaining about 10 and 11 year olds
i must live in a bubble because i don't
hear it but i'll take it on
faith that a lot of people are talking
about those
damn 10 and 11 year olds disdainfully
disdainfully anyway she's talking
how it's bad that people would imagine
that they lack talent
and gifts because they're being under
uh underserved so her point is that
kids especially in minority places
you don't want their whole life
determined by their bad school
so by the the age of 11 bad school may
have
sort of set their fate of course
somebody went into the comments and
quickly noted school choice should help
fix that
so we have a problem which is kids
especially minority kids getting uh
under
let's say a low quality education but
there's a fix which is school choice
because competition
eventually tends to improve just about
everything
and here's what ida bay wells said
to the comment that school choice would
help fix that she said
school choice literally came about to
stymy
integration but nice try
so her argument against
school choice in 2020 is that the reason
school choice first was introduced
was a scheme to stymie integration
now is that true or is it false
why do i care what's the difference if
it's true
what's the difference if it's false it's
the past it's the past
what if you found that the
country called the united states was
a founded around unfortunately
in many states slavery
would you say that the united states
maybe is a bad
system because it was founded on a
pretty bad principle
you know women couldn't vote slaves
weren't
considered people so is the entire
united states bad because of the way it
was
founded or or
just going to put this out there do you
allow
that pretty much everything in the past
was shitty
and it may have evolved into something
that we like today
because uh don't conservatives say this
about
uh well there's a lot of talk about how
things were founded everything from
democrats were really the kkk
and uh you know uh planned parenthood
was really about
you know exterminating the the black
population
there are a lot of things that were
founded
for a purpose that over time became some
other purpose
so if your strategy for improving your
situation
is based on what something was founded
as
you've got a really bad strategy and
i've been saying forever that the
biggest problem in the black community
is their strategy
meaning that if you look for example
let's take the lgbtq arc of
uh freedom if you want to say if you
look at
how lgbtq folks have handled their own
let's say their own struggle to
to get equal rights in this country
would you say that their strategy was
good
or bad i would say it was really good
i would say if you were to look at the
strategy that especially the gay
community
has used for what 20 or 30 years to
improve their situation excellent
a plus i would say just on a strategy
level
really really really really really good
in every way
i mean i can't even find anything that's
wrong with their strategy
so but in the in the case of the black
population trying to improve their
situation
their strategy is so obviously bad
and do you know why i can't help
i don't know either why can't i help
i want to help i would like to say um
i think you're getting your strategy
from a journalist
you know a journalist is telling you
that school choice
is a bad idea essentially because of the
the reason it was founded
which doesn't have much correlation at
all with why people do it today
today they do it because they're trying
to improve education that's sort of the
point of it
so if you're getting your strategy
from a journalist have you gotten it
from the right place
now i don't like to be the one who says
stay in your lane
i believe a journalist could have the
best strategy in the world
but not in this case who would you
rather listen to
kanye who says don't get lost in the
past
and then went and used his own strategy
to build a
you know a multi-billion dollar empire
do you want to listen to the person who
built a multi-billion dollar empire
about what a good strategy looks like or
do you want to look at somebody
who's a journalist
there's a big difference now you could
say well but wait a minute kanye's
basically an artist don't you mock
artists
yeah i do mock artists i don't market
i don't mock an artist who built
multi-billion dollar
industries there's obviously something
going else going on with kanye he's got
other talents it's pretty obvious so
i think the black population uh
really has a strategy problem that's
just
uh it's like it's worse than the
pandemic like literally
is literally worse than the pandemic and
it's just strategy
it really is it's come down to just
shitty strategy
because everything else that they want
it's available
i mean it's not available immediately
you'd have to employ a strategy and
keep on it and you know it's going to
take years to
to show improvement etc but it's
available
it's not like it's not available you
just use a better strategy
all right the question of asymptomatic
spread i was talking about yesterday
there were some studies that at least
suggested that almost
none of the spread comes from
asymptomatic people
and therefore the smart people say well
wait a minute
if very little of the spread can be tied
to asymptomatic spreading
why are asymptomatic people wearing
masks
right why are they why do they have to
lock down
because if you have to have symptoms
to spread it at least in any meaningful
way to spread it
wouldn't it be easy just say well you
got symptoms
so you do your thing because you got
symptoms stay away from people whatever
you have to do
i don't have symptoms so i'll just live
like a normal person
and take my less than one percent chance
that i'll run into somebody who
who can be an asymptomatic spreader that
sounds logical
right is what i just said
completely rational to you i think my
audience
maybe not the whole country but my
audience is probably compatible with
that
yeah if we know asymptomatic spreading
is trivial
why don't the people who have no
symptoms just live life
and the people who do have symptoms go
to a little
more extreme and they're quarantining
and we're done here right wouldn't we be
done
i mean literally if you only made that
change
aren't we done is that what you think
i don't think so and let me tell you why
you may have had the following
experience which i did and it goes like
this
someone in your family gets symptoms
but you also have something you need to
do
got to travel you know
you got things you need to do but
somebody in the family has symptoms
let's say they haven't been confirmed
yet
so the test isn't coming back because it
takes a week to get the test
by the way where i live my health care
provider
will take longer than one week so far
to give you your test result longer than
a week
so if you've got a symptom and you don't
have your test result back
but you know that the symptom could be
one of you know a variety of different
things
and you've got stuff to do
let me ask you this do you quarantine
with
extreme rigorousness
you'd like to think you would right
if you're not in the situation you say
to yourself uh of course i would
if somebody in my family had symptoms
yeah
i'm gonna lock that person up in a
closet you know whatever
i'm gonna stay away i'm gonna you know
i'm gonna move out to a hotel for a week
that's what you say let me tell you what
you do
it's a little thing called cognitive
dissonance
that's right if you find yourself in
this situation
you will invent rationalizations
why it doesn't apply to you
you think you won't but you will
you will and you will do that reliably
and predictably every psychologist
who understands the field would be able
to predict this with
complete certainty that once you're in
the situation
you're going to say yeah
but we'll just have little johnny
sit in the back seat and tell him to
breathe sideways
yeah we'll just tell we'll just tell
johnny to wear a mask and we'll
bundle the other kids into the little
car and stay there for three hours while
we're driving in this little confined
space
with somebody who probably has coveted
but
you know we don't have the test results
back and i'm feeling maybe it was
probably a cold
and ah you know i don't believe in you
know
right people will justify
any risk away to do what they want to do
it's the most basic part of our
operating system
is we don't care about reasons now let
me take that back
we don't care about facts and we also
don't care about what we said we would
do
we don't care about any of that we kind
of want to do
what we want to do and if there's
something stopping us from doing it
we will imagine it doesn't matter
because of reasons that we make up that
only sound good to us
but anybody looking on would say that
doesn't sound like a good reason
until they're in it and then that very
person who criticized you
they get in the same situation they do
the same freaking thing
cognitive dissonance is very very
predictable
and those people would say you know it's
not that big a deal if
my family takes a little bit of risk
how much difference could that make to
the whole i mean i'm just one family and
you know so that's what would happen so
the point is if you were to make a rule
that said
you only need a mask if you have
symptoms
what would happen people with symptoms
would find a reason not to wear a mask
and they would say to themselves yeah i
do have symptoms i'm coughing
i got a dry cough i can't smell anything
but i feel like it's the flu i'm sorry i
feel like it's allergies
how many people who had coronavirus
symptoms
would tell themselves it was it was just
allergies
so they didn't have to wear the mask to
the mall
most of them probably more than half
would not wear a mask with symptoms
and they'd still go to the mall if if we
got to the point where only
symptom people with symptoms were
supposed to wear masks
so there's no way that
the managing the asymptomatic versus
symptomatic thing
can work in the real world if people
could actually
you know comply then it'd be a great
idea but people would not comply they
would not even come close
i'd like to point out that most of the
fake news that
well i don't know i think it's
competitive but the news on the right
is just filled with fake news on
coronavirus stuff and election stuff
news on the left is filled with fake
news usually
trump related fake news but probably
we're
we're reaching peak fade fake news
because we're having uh at least
potentially we're having a change of
leadership
i remember i told you that the that
whoever is and
uh whoever is not in power meaning if
biden's in power
fox news is sort of a power if you know
what i mean
uh whoever is not in power creates the
most fake news
but during the transition you might have
this weird situation where both the left
and the right are cranking out fake news
full time until there's you know
unambiguously
one leader and then the fake news will
will start to be biased just toward the
the opposition side but at the moment
because you've got this
i'm not entirely sure who's the
president at least according to
a lot of the country you have you have
double fake news
so you're getting bombarded on both
sides i would i would advise you
that whatever credibility you put on
your own
news sources drop it to zero
trust me whatever you thought was the
credibility of your own news sources the
ones you thought had been pretty good
for the last several years
just for the moment for about a month
drop it to zero there's no credibility
on the left or the right at the moment
you i would see that the you we might
creep back to a little more credibility
but right now none
um would you like to compare the
leadership of joe biden
hypothetically and president trump
reality if you'd like to be good at
comparing things you came to the right
place
a lot of what we think is political
disagreement is just
people who don't know how to compare
things well arguing with people who do
and the people who don't know how to
compare things right don't know that
they don't know how to do it
here's an example let's say you were to
compare
who would be better in the pandemic
leadership and i just
took some you know some of the main
things that are involved in leadership
notice that i left out from the list the
idea of
rapid testing which is different from
testing really fast
so the first thing you need to know is
that when i use the phrase
rapid testing for coronavirus that has
nothing in common
with testing really fast testing really
fast would be great
but we don't have any products that can
do that and be the highest level of
accuracy
the rapid testing is a little less
sensitive test
but they're so cheap that you can test a
lot and the testing a lot
compensates for the fact that they're a
little less accurate if they're cheap
everybody has them and then the
pandemic's over trump has never pushed
it but neither has biden
so i would say on one of the biggest
issues of
coronavirus leadership both biden and
trump
failed 100 on just that issue
now i say failed because neither of them
have even said
we considered it and here's the reason
that we don't want to go harder at it
had they done that i would say well i
don't know if they failed or not
but they've at least got a point of view
neither biden or trump have expressed a
public point of view on the concept of
rapid testing
which has nothing in common with testing
really fast
testing really fast is sort of stuff
we're you know trying to do
rapid testing is a whole different thing
neither of them they both ignored it
uh who would have closed travel early
and how important it is
this is the column that is teaching you
how to think if you didn't already do
this
issues are not of equal importance all
right
closing the travel early probably made a
big difference
we can tell from the way both biden and
trump
talked about it during the time when it
mattered biden was
not in favor of closing as early as
trump i would say the
importance of closing the border was i'm
just going to put a number on it
think of this in terms of a way of
thinking
if you wanted to put different
percentages here you might get a
different outcome
but in terms of the way to approach it
that's that's what you want to learn
here just the approach
so i'm going to say 20 importance seems
about right
and i would say i would give that to
trump trump did something
right more right than biden and
we're being fair here right this is this
is the
live stream where i'm not being just
overtly political
did trump close travel sufficiently
early enough and aggressively enough
especially in europe
especially closing all the travel as
opposed to making exceptions
i'd say no no i think trump
did not close early enough or tight
enough
but we do know for sure that biden would
have been
even worse because what he said he would
do is
obvious now in retrospect it's obvious
biden would have been worse on this one
and it's 20 of the whole thing all right
in
in my view of things how about being a
role model for wearing masks
i would say biden is much more
consistent
and his messaging is much more
compatible
with the experts so therefore biden's
better
would you say biden is better unmasked
because he's
closer to the experts he's more
consistent
and he models it consistently in public
better than trump right well here's the
thing
you have to imagine that if biden had
been president
the conservatives would listen to him
that's sort of crazy right
it's not like biden would have the
better messaging and therefore he would
get the better
outcome i would agree completely
that biden's messaging on masks was
far superior than trump's messaging on
masks
but here's the thing it didn't matter
it didn't matter at all because if biden
had been president do you think
conservatives are going to listen to
biden
and say oh you know i had my own
information
from i don't know fox news and my own
research
but now that you tell me that my arch
enemy
biden says i should wear a mask and
reduce my freedom
well why didn't you tell me democrats i
was just waiting for a democrat to tell
me to reduce my freedom
and now i'm all on board does anybody
think that would have happened
so what the the fake news has sold you
on
is this ridiculous idea that because
biden's messaging on masks was better
which it was 100 percent better not even
close
biden's messaging on masks killed
trump's messaging on masks but here's
what trump
gets right he knows what matters
he does a terrible job trump does on
things that don't matter very much
biden did a terrific job terrific job
on something that didn't matter now the
reason i gave it to 5
importance is not and this is important
not because i think masks don't work but
because
as a function of leadership it wasn't
going to make that much difference
so i'm only giving it a low percent not
in terms of
effectiveness of stopping anything but
only in terms of could a leader make any
difference
if if you know would biden's messaging
really move the needle no
there's very little chance it would have
made things better it might have made
things worse
if you're a conservative and you're a
trump supporter and you see trump say
you know i think the experts probably
are right
yeah maybe you should wear a mask use
your judgment it's sort of not strong
enough
but at least he's trump at least he's
the guy that many of you voted for
if you assume that the democrats are
masking up better than the conservatives
who is better to com to convince a
conservative to wear a mask
would a conservative be more convinced
to wear a mask
because a leftist told them to
or because one of their own told them to
but he didn't tell him as strongly and
as effectively
which one would get you a better math
result
i don't think that's clear but
it's it's a not a big
lever vaccination speed even trump's
critics give him
an a-plus biden said
follow the science if you followed the
science would
project warp speed have worked nope
if you followed the science you would
have taken the recommendation of the
scientists
don't push us it's going to take five
years trump
did not take the recommendation of the
scientists in this
one sense in which he said no i'm going
to push you you're going to do it in six
months
and they freaking did it they actually
did it
i would say that the vaccination will be
at least 70
of the solution at least i mean you
could put this
higher but i wanted to leave a few
percentages for the other stuff
i mean maybe it's you know even higher
than 70.
how about lockdown persuasion the the
just the ability of the president to get
the states to do what he wanted to do
and specifically to lock down would
baiden be better at getting states
to be a little more rigorous about
locking down
well he might have better messaging
just like he might have better messaging
on masks but would it make a difference
do you think florida would lock down
if it were still up to florida
republican governor
right do you think a republican state
like texas
or florida would say oh you know now
that biden's president
this democrat we republicans who
disagree with him completely
yeah we'll we'll do more lockdowns
because now a
democrat is telling us to lock down our
republican state so
yeah we're more likely to lock down no
no no that's not going to happen
so again you can say that the lockdown
is
you know the biggest most important
thing we do
but why you can't argue if you're being
rational
is that one leader would have gotten you
much of a difference
compared to the other i don't believe
biden would have gotten much of a
difference
in terms of lockdown given that the
states really are the prime
movers of you know of what's happening
there
uh then on school closures i would say
that at this point we just say trump is
right
on one of the biggest issues that has
more to do with protecting the you know
the mental health of our kids
trump was just just right right
people disagree to them but here we are
and now people say yeah we probably
should open the schools
he was right now when i look at this
if you were to say if you were to say to
yourself incorrectly
the two most important things might be
mask wearing
and lockdowns and i say incorrectly not
based on science
of you know whether these things stop
things but i'm just saying that if you
believe these are the two big things
you tell yourself but biden's better on
the two big things
so that's pretty good right but what
you're not doing
is understanding that the two big things
don't have really any
sensitivity to leadership leadership
probably not the biggest variable except
for this
and maybe for the school closure things
and i would say
this is my honest opinion with no
hyperbole if you were to compare
trump's leadership to bidens
it's not even close it's not even close
trump killed it
on this he killed it that i think
historians will judge
that uh you know once they properly
understand that biden couldn't have done
much about masks or about lockdowns
either which i think everybody would
agree with
if they thought about it once you
realize that
this was one of the best examples of
leadership
in all of history and actually i think
the historians will someday regard it as
one of the best
uh especially the operation warp speed i
think people will see it as one of the
best acts of leadership
of all time in the end
and trust me if you're new to this i
i know already the criticisms i'll get
is that uh you know i'm just in the bag
for trump and whatever
blah blah i'm just gonna support trump
but you've all heard me criticize them
including on the rapid testing which is
a giant mistake it just happens to be a
mistake that biden is making at the same
time
here's my christmas provocation related
to this
and i'll remind you i said this if trump
had been president of south korea
instead of being president of the united
states would his result in south korea
be just as good against the coronavirus
as as south korea got which is
considered a success
i say yes if trump had been president of
south korea
he would have done just as well as the
south korean president did
why well apparently there's a private
company in south korea
who as soon as the the virus was
identified
started working hard on test kits and so
south korea for a number of reasons they
had sort of an
island situation because of the the dmz
doesn't let anybody through so
effectively they were kind of an island
so that's a big advantage
and then they had the coincidental
advantage of having
a company that independently stepped up
and gave them enough testing for their
little island country
so that was different if trump had been
president of south korea
still that independent private company
would have still
did what it did it noticed the virus it
made the test kits
and so south korea had had a way to test
their way to tamping it down that just
wasn't available in the united states
so you take the president of south korea
and you move into the united states
he wants to be the same leader and he's
like hey let's
let's test really fast and then he finds
out he can't
because in the united states there was
not a company that
independently created a bunch of really
good tests
really fast didn't happen here and it
wasn't because south korea was
was so well managed it was because there
was an independent company
that got ahead of the curve that's it
that and the fact that they're an island
nation then on top of that you add the
culture
if you assume that masks work is would
you get better compliance in south korea
no matter who is the president would you
get better mass
compliance and social distancing in
south korea
yes yeah there's a cultural difference
if you move the president of south korea
over to the united states and that
president said hey everybody
wear masks and do social distancing
would he get more compliance
than trump did i don't think so
would would biden get more compliance
than either
trump would or the president of south
korea if he had been the president of
the united states
i don't think so there's no evidence he
would have gotten more compliance
they would have basically been doing the
same thing and gotten the same result
so my argument is this the country makes
the leader as much as the leader makes
the country
and we put too much belief in the in the
leader's work
as the the main mechanism of change and
they are
obviously very important but really
the office makes the president the
country makes the president
the reason we have a president trump is
because there's something about america
right you don't get it you don't get
president trump
unless there's something about america
and you don't get you don't get maybe a
president trump
elected in south korea because whatever
it is about south korea it's different
so thinking that the leader is changing
the country
is a little bit of wrong think it's
actually that the
nature of the country so
so long as they have a democratic
process is giving you
the leader that the country wanted
so keep that in mind
all right um
here's the reason that the fake news
can't criticize
trump for what i consider his biggest
mistake in the pandemic
which is not pursuing the rapid testing
idea
which is completely different from
testing really fast
i recovered that because if the fake
news
criticized trump for not doing it
what would happen what would happen if
the fake news
criticized trump for not doing the rapid
testing technique
if they criticized him for it it would
educate people
what it was and that it would happen
so if the fake news criticized trump for
not doing
rapid testing there would already be
rapid testing
so they would actually solve the
pandemic by criticizing trump
somebody says they did i know there had
been an article or two about it but
basically it's not really a story on cnn
or msnbc
it's not a headline story that they they
pound all the time
it's just something they mentioned and
then they dropped it and left
all right that
uh so watch this in the comments how
many people don't understand what rapid
testing is so you're seeing the comments
oh there's this place in the united
states that is doing rapid testing
oh there was a rapid test recently
approved
none of them are rapid testing so if you
believe
that we're close to it or working toward
it or the
things that have been recently approved
are in this category of called
rapid testing you don't know what rapid
testing is
what you're talking about is tests that
are
kind of fast that's not rapid testing
because you have to add the cheap and
super rapid part of it
or else it's a whole different concept
uh somebody's saying how accurate are
rapid tests that is a misunderstanding
of what a rapid test is
so to ask the question if you're asking
the question
how accurate the rapid tests are then
you don't understand the concept of a
rapid test
the concept is that a a
a lower accurate test will get you a
better result
if you do enough of them because if the
first test doesn't work
the second one does etc
somebody says low accuracy testing is
not as useful as you think it is
how do you know where was it tested
i think that the logic of it is so
strong that while i accept
i accept the possibility that it might
not be the kill shot i think
the fact that it's not being at least
tested somewhere you know may be tested
in a state or something
the fact that it's not being tested is
complete failure
right even if once you tested it it
wasn't as good as you thought
but the fact that you're not testing it
and so obviously
looks like it's a good idea even if
you're wrong
giant mistake now i say the same thing
about hydroxychloroquine if it turns out
that hydroxychloroquine has
no impact on the coronavirus
it would still be unambiguously a
mistake
that we didn't try it before we you know
could have certainty
because the risk reward was right even
if even if the drug was no good
all right that's all we get uh
so all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
all right looking at you youtube
periscope is off uh somebody says it
wasn't a mistake
paul says it was intentional
maybe i mean i don't know what
intentional means in this case but
maybe somebody says thank god the liquor
store
stayed open well you know what uh if you
watch conservative news
one part of the fake news on
conservative news
was this uh keeping open the liquor
stores
when you heard that liquor stores were
gonna stay open but you know other
businesses were
not didn't you say to yourself ah how
does that make sense
liquor is optional and the answer is
alcoholics
if you have a pandemic and alcoholics
don't have access to
legally by alcohol they're still going
to get it
just they would do it illegally or they
would uh have major
medical problems for having to suddenly
stop drinking
which is not the best way to stop
drinking in many cases
so the question on liquor stores if if
you saw a story that the liquor stores
were staying open
and they did not mention the next fact
that uh addiction specialists or experts
actually recommended it so addiction
experts
recommended for health reasons
to keep liquor stores open because the
the people who are addicted to liquor
if they stop cold turkey it's a problem
they need to stop professionally and
with it with the system and
you know maybe uh they need to in they
need to be in treatment
in order to make the stopping be a good
idea
so are the experts right you know are
the addiction experts right who said you
know
maybe if it's short-term just leave the
liquor stores open
are they right i don't know i don't know
but they had a reason
and that reason isn't generally not
reported on conservative news
so if if the experts have a reason and
your news didn't show you the reason
whether or not you agreed with it
is different but they didn't even show
you the reason
that's fake news all right that's all
for now
i'll see
