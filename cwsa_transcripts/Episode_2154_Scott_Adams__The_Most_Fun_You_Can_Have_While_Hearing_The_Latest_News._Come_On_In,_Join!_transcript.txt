good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization I
call it coffee with Scott Adams and you
could call it that too if you'd like
today's experience to be something that
uh you could generally only get under
Medical Care
or doing something illegal all you need
to do is get a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker Chelsea Stein the canteen jug or
flask of vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better in
your entire life is called simultaneous
now go
ah
well the news is full of fun and
exciting stories today about persuasion
and Intrigue and Mysteries and puzzles
all good stuff
if you like stuff like this well does
anybody do this
um
one of the funniest things for me is
watching what Twitter puts in the
trending box on the right side of the
screen if you're using the browser
and sometimes they'll pair trending
things that are funny when you see them
together
for example this moment this morning at
least for about five minutes uh the the
following three things were trending on
Twitter
Loomer
Christy
turd
so Laura Loomer Chris Christie and
turd
now the funny thing about this is you
automatically think it's about Amber
Heard right because she had that funny
nickname Amber turd
nope it just turns out that a lot of
people were calling each other turds at
the same time
it must be the word of the year the word
of the year is third it's trending
I feel like it's applicable to almost
every story
you could almost you could almost use as
the headline of every story
turd makes submarine that is not well
tested
right
whistleblowers
tell us about the turds in the
Department of Justice it works for
everything you can put it in every
situation
all right so today was funny CNN is of
course going to try to take down Jesse
Waters he's now Target number one
because Jesse Waters took over the uh
the Tucker Carlson spot and that's the
big the big media spot everybody wants
that
so the story of the CNN is running like
a whole big feature story
on this all right imagine that CNN
thought this was important enough for a
features like a big piece right and then
when it's done you tell me
you tell me if there was anything in the
story just anything
right but they tried pretty hard to take
him down here's the story that uh
Jesse had some kind of a corporate event
that he'd agreed to do presumably some
paid speaking thing
and he goes in and at some point they
say but Jesse says he doesn't recall
saying it which is funny in itself you
know I think he did say it probably but
he says he doesn't have doesn't recall
because it was literally just an offhand
comment of some kind
and the offhand comment uh allegedly
reportedly
questioned whether Kamala Harris is
really a woman
you know he made some kind of joke about
her her gender identity
and so CNN reported that as my God it
was you know people were just upset and
they were beside themselves and oh my
God
goodbye Andrew
now do you think that there were many
people in the audience who were offended
by that
feels like a national story doesn't it
no
no because there's nobody in the world
who wouldn't know that was a joke
Kamala Harris is not even making any
claims about her gender identity it
could be it couldn't be more
disconnected from anything that matters
I didn't hear the joke but do you think
it matters no people people saying
mocking things about a president and a
vice president are the most normal thing
you can do in in America
so that was a big old nothing so it was
so much nothing that when Jesse said he
doesn't remember doing it
I actually believe that I actually
believe it because it was such a nothing
offhand common
but they're coming for him
the funniest part about it is that the
event that was scheduled right after
Jesse Waters uh talk uh was a woke
brainwashing session they all had to
leave Jesse Waters and go into it
immediately into one of those woke
brainwashing sessions
I just thought it was funny that they
scheduled it then
well speaking of weakness workness
continues to die in a whole variety of
ways we might find out
some of it today or maybe we already
know
yes we do decision just came out
affirmative action
just ended
affirmative action just ended Supreme
Court just ruled
now I believe this only applies to
college admissions
can I get a clarification on that it's
only child it's only College admissions
right
so uh big congratulations to Asian
Americans who I think LED that fight
good job good job
Asian Americans
coming through
all right
um
wow
wow
wow
ah well that's heading to be a little
harder than I thought it would you might
be aware that affirmative action is a
big part of my story
uh
so that's a big deal to me that's a big
big deal to me
thank you president Trump
for uh back in that Court
I don't think you get it otherwise
wow
wow
I don't even know what to say about that
just wow
holy cow
all right well we'll have lots more
about that that just broke brand new
um
wow
let's talk about AG Garland and so the
the latest
I think Hannity did a good job of
describing this so there's this whistle
whistleblower Gary shapley and I guess
there's some other whistleblowers so at
this point we have super credible
information
that the investigation into Hunter's
laptop was impeded
very directly very obviously
impeded
and there's not really much doubt about
it nor is there much doubt that Hunter
was working his foreign sources and and
you know twisting their arms to give
them money for what I don't know access
I guess to his father so we we now have
pretty much the most
credible information you could ever have
because remember the whistleblowers are
public
at least one of them
and the others seem to be confirming
we're not talking about some anonymous
source we're talking about somebody who
was in the room
and is in public saying I was in the
room and all these other people in the
room were saying the same thing
and here's the document that says
exactly what we were telling you
uh is there something going wrong here
that's like very wrong and I don't even
know how to capture it in my head
and it goes something like this
I think Biden could actually murder
somebody on Fifth Avenue
and get away with it
am I wrong
he could murder somebody on Fifth Avenue
and get away with it
because he is right in front of us now
it's not murder
but it appears to be one of the biggest
crimes
I've ever seen
name a bigger crime
right I mean without without violence if
you take violence out of it
for a non-violent crime
name a bigger one
Bernie Madoff
I don't think so I don't think so Bernie
Madoff may have gotten more money
but his cry was definitely not worse
than what we're apparently seeing
allegedly
right oh Epstein okay abstain was worse
I'll give you that one
but who is covering up for Epstein
maybe it's connected who knows
but I guess the thing that's blowing me
away is that we're just
we talk about it and then we go on like
business as as usual or something
I feel like this should be the least
business as usual thing that ever
happened now I hate to do that thing
where you flip it around and say imagine
if this were happening to Trump
but it kind of does apply doesn't it
I feel like this time it applies
and once again
Tucker Carlson is shown to be prophetic
if not genius
that when he told us for years he's been
saying this that whatever the Democrats
are doing is what they're accusing you
of
basically
the bidens we're doing everything they
accused Trump of colluding with foreign
Nations taking money tried to use the
offices of money making thing trying to
enrich his family business the family
every part of the accusation begins
Trump every part was exactly what they
were doing for years
I and and the thing about it is
it's so abusively obvious I don't know
what to do about it
I actually don't know what to do and I
and I observe that nobody's doing
anything about it there doesn't correct
me if I'm wrong there appears to be no
action toward making this
better
now I've heard that there's a
possibility
that the judge might not accept the plea
deal which I guess is the thing they can
do that and and the reason would be new
information shows that
um you know there was something went
wrong especially because the prosecutor
in the case was told by garland that he
could do whatever he wanted he could
bring the case in any domain he wanted
he had full Authority and then it turned
out he didn't have anything like that he
couldn't bring the case in different
states and that's where it had to be
taken and so he couldn't pursue it
I I don't you know I I just don't even
know what to say about it it's so
mind-blowing that we just here to watch
it like it's Tuesday oh well there's the
president taking money from other
countries lying about it covered it up
and We Know It All We Know It All We're
Not guessing about any of it that's the
weird part I just
I don't know anyway you know at least
with the Trump accusations
you can always say Well they're unproven
and stuff like that and then turns out
none of them were true but this is not a
case of unproven allegations is it
it's right in front of us and still we
do nothing
we're still we're still talking about
Joe Biden the probable uh winner of the
next presidential election
how
how in the world are we even having that
conversation the conversation should
have long ago long ago turned into he
can't possibly win so let's not talk
about him anymore
am I wrong
should not the conversation have already
changed to or he's out
so we're really only looking at these
other people now and it didn't it didn't
it didn't change
why why well part of the reason is we're
the citizenry is completely disconnected
from the at the news
we're only connected to the uh the
narratives now and the the propaganda we
were not even connected to facts not
even a little bit we hear them they just
don't change our actions and that's
strange
we're act we're only changing our
actions based on things that are
obviously am I wrong
the only thing that changes how we Act
are stories that aren't true
so we're in a weird situation where
we're all LARPing
yeah it's not true so we better go do
something about it but if it is true
not interesting
all right
uh RFK Jr made a bunch of news at least
according to me and uh on a bunch of
different topics so we have more clarity
on some of his opinions and I gotta say
talk about hitting a base clearing home
run of persuasion
I don't know if he's going to win like
I'm not predicting he's going to win
but
oh my God
he's really good at this so I'm talking
about RFK Jr the way I often take talk
about Trump which is just to his
persuasion skill it's just not normal it
is not normal ordinary people can't do
this he's a very special character and I
completely understand why Trump says he
likes them and vice versa they're kind
of the same person without the hyperbole
right if you take Trump's hyperbole away
and just bake him down to like the
common sense Trump
it looks a lot like RFK
you know does this work have we tested
it is the cost greater than the benefit
you know that stuff you know the normal
stuff that people should be doing but
they don't
um but let me just give you a few of the
things that RFK Jr said and watch your
watch your jaw just drop
it's almost like you didn't know that
anybody could talk reasonably about some
of these topics you hear it for the
first time you go oh
I guess that's what a smart person would
say in this situation
so here he is on drugs
you would legalize psychedelics and
marijuana
free money
free money
he's compatible with science he's
compatible with the news he's compatible
with the public the only person he's not
compatible with is our worthless
government
only the government is against it in in
terms of majority only the government
so he's he's basically saying I'm for
the people and against the government
here's a good example
your government doesn't want the things
that science says will work we'll we'll
fix your addictions the psychedelics are
really good for fixing depression
addiction anxiety a whole bunch of stuff
and he's so he's saying let's make it
legal
okay
free money
now why didn't anybody else pick up that
free money
you know it was just sitting on the
table for a long time
am I wrong it's just sitting there it's
on the table and everybody's just
walking past it like it's not even there
and RFK walks past the table he looks
over there's a big table of money
anybody
seriously you're just leaving this I can
just pick this up right
I'm doing it I'm picking up the money
does anybody have an objection
okay all right I think we're all good
and he walks away with the money
that's what he just did right in front
of you
now I've been saying forever that I wish
Trump had done that exactly this
but Trump can't do this because he's
he's just sort of the anti-drinking anti
every kind of drug person and I do
respect that actually
I respect Trump's
you know more absolutist take I don't
think is right
but I do respect
yeah so here is now there's a second
part of this
which I think fits with it which is RFK
Jr said he wants to build uh addiction
what do you call it
uh Healing Centers for addiction
so he didn't call it recovery called the
healing which I also like
because healing healing tells you it's a
medical problem
right I like that persuasion-wise
healing is way better than recovery
would you agree
healing is a good word I like healing
but he also said and this is a really
big point that he would put these
Healing Centers in
rural areas
that's perfect
do you remember me saying that we should
build addiction cities
where if you're addicted you can go to
this place where it's just addicts but
they have no access to any kind of
substance you just it's almost like a
jail in the sense that you can't get in
but once you get in it's just like a
regular city right it's not a jail on
the inside but as a jail like security
that you can't even drop stuff from a
drone they'll shoot it out of the air so
that you just can't get drugs but
otherwise it's like a cool place to live
with some people who have something in
common with you
and now he says put it in rural areas
and I really think that's the secret
I think the secret is you have to get
them out of the inner city because
otherwise they just walk out the door
and score a drug on the sidewalk as soon
as they leave you want to get them in
nature right get them in a rural area
get have them go hiking every day in the
woods
and you want them to leave that saying
oh I found another way to feel good
I found another way to feel good that's
your healing
now how much do you love the fact that
he is he is a successful recovered
healed he's a healed addict
that's really strong you know some
people are going to say oh that's a
negative he was a drug addict for a
number of years 40 years ago and I'm
going to say nope that is absolutely a
positive I I want I want to somebody
who's been in a war to be my general
I want somebody who's being addiction
to beat our addictions
right I want somebody who understands
that
on a cellular level
right now here's what you don't want and
I saw this again today
uh taking drugs is a choice
how many of you think that
now certainly is a choice the first time
you do it definitely a choice the first
time you do it
but at some point how many of you would
say taking drugs is a choice for an
addict once you're an addict you think
that's a choice
all right good yeah I I have the
smartest audience in the world I think
actually literally I think I do in terms
of politics
it's not a choice
it's not a choice and you need somebody
who knows that
if you don't know that
you don't know anything
you don't know anything
that's the first thing you have to
understand if you don't get that you
don't get anything
and he understands it because he's
Bennett he isn't he lives it so that's
that's a big deal
now I haven't heard what he would do
about the cartels he may have said
something about that but I don't know so
I would say this is the best
um the best package for dealing with
that that's running although I liked
vivek's take of militarily attacking and
some of the other Republicans uh
militarily attacking the cartels
I don't know if RFK Jr would say yes to
that
but
um I'd love to see what he says about it
and so so I'm reserving my judgment so I
still like ramaswamy on fence at all
because he would go after the cartels
all right here's another one you want
here's some more free money
RFK Jr went to some kind of crypto thing
the other day and said I will make sure
that your right to use and hold Bitcoin
is inviolable
uh Bitcoin is the only bulwark against
totalitarianism and the manipulation of
our money supply
come on
come on
free money
RFK Jr walks by a second table
this piles full of money
once again
he looks at the big pile of money which
is do you like Bitcoin to be illegal or
do you want your government to ban it
people want their Bitcoin
the people have decided we want the
Bitcoin all right
so RFK JR says oh why don't I just agree
with the people
why don't I agree with freedom
it was free
do you know what do you know what
pushback you got from all like CNN and
MSNBC for having that opinion
none
none do you know how much pushback you
got from Fox News and Breitbart for
being in favor of Bitcoin
none
none zero he just had to say the words
and yeah I'm sure he means it
but it's crazy isn't it he's making the
other candidates look like chimpanzees
now to be fair I think Vivek is also I I
don't know but I'm sure he's in favor of
Bitcoin yeah you can confirm that right
the VAC is pro-bitcoin
I'm saying that only because he's smart
so he must be
right
gotta be right yeah we just assume that
anybody that smart is in favor of
Bitcoin isn't that weird
isn't it weird that you can know you can
know what Rama Swami's opinion is on
bitcoin without knowing what his opinion
is on bitcoin
isn't that isn't that fun
because you just know he's the smartest
guy in the race
so of course he's in favor of it of
course he is
all right so that's two piles of free
money the RFK just picked up
let's see what else he did
uh how about his uh his opinion on
climate change well you hate that don't
you oh don't you hate that ugh
climate change RFK Jr is worried about
that and many of my audience are saying
that's not something you should be
concentrating on
right it's a big mistake do you think
big mistake
well I don't know if you know what his
opinion is but his opinion is that he
would let the free market take care of
it
now what do you think he'd let the free
market take care of climate change
damn it
he did it again
he did it again
he found the place that everybody agrees
instead of telling us what the science
is and then we we yell at him because
that's a terrible move
do not tell us what the science is we
don't believe it we know science lies to
us for a variety of reasons and even if
the science is right about it we don't
believe it
there's no credibility
so he finds this Middle Ground which is
let the free market take care of it now
I don't think you could have said that
20 years ago or 10 or even five
but what's different is that we're we're
sort of at a
a really interesting competitive place
where the Elon musks of the world will
say solar will give you everything you
need
it's already it's already cheaper than
um nuclear
it's infinitely reproducible
and it's good so you know you know
nuclear is good too Elon Musk is
pro-nuclear but he's saying that you
know salt is even better
so I don't know if that's true
because here's my little economics
lesson
whatever is true today is irrelevant
because both solar and nuclear are going
to be wildly changing in the next number
of years in terms of their economics
like one one little breakthrough in
batteries
and then solar rules right just a
breakthrough in batteries and there are
breakthroughs and batteries all the time
so just one big breakthrough in
batteries or how about this one big
breakthrough in recycling solar panels
which is hard to do now
do you think there'll be no big
breakthroughs where they can create a
solar product that can be recycled or
maybe last forever or something like
that sure
now how about nuclear nuclear is
uneconomical because of all the red tape
it's uneconomical because it's hard to
get insurance RFK JR says
and we build them one-off like
everyone's design special so it's
impossible to improve and it takes 20
years and the overruns are 10 times that
and you get all these problems right all
true
but every one of those problems is being
addressed
and if you were president you could
probably do something to reduce the
um the regulatory burden
so that would change the economics
wildly
you could although I don't think Trump
did
I'll take a fact check on that but I
don't think Trump changed enough or
anything if he did about the nuclear
regulatory environment maybe because
those are State decisions I don't know
I mean there must be some way the
federal government could come up with a
single standard
um
but you could imagine that they could
standardize
the design so that gets rid of the
design questions you can imagine they
would could reduce some regulations if
the federal government pushed on it you
imagine that you could find a way to
insure it because France does
and you imagine that there might be a
generation four that's coming that eats
nuclear waste doesn't have a risk of of
melting down those those are all the
advanced stages of development right now
so I don't think there's anybody who's
smart enough who can do the economics or
even or even the environmental risk of
either nuclear or solar
because they're both they're both moving
like this you get that right in the next
10 years the economics of both of those
are just going to be just all over the
place there's just no way to know
so
um
under those conditions where we now have
a fair fight between the Green energies
and the nuclears and and everything else
this is the year
just this year 2023 where that's the
strongest argument let the market decide
but if the market had been deciding
since the beginning I don't think we
would have solar power where it is now I
don't think we'd have electric cars
I think there's a lot of things we
wouldn't have in the green world if the
government had hadn't been subsidizing
and pushing it but they may have
subsidized and pushed it enough so we
now have a fully legitimately
competitive market that's what it feels
like to me it feels legitimately
competitive under that very unique
situation which never existed until this
year ish
you wouldn't just say let the market
take care of it
because it wouldn't have happened it
just wouldn't have happened you know
there's too many entrenched everything
so
I think RFK Jr just found the the
bleeding edge of thinking
on this topic we finally reached the
point where maybe the market can decide
and that we'd end up with a good outcome
with that
so I would say his climate change View
is
really close to mine right now
it's really close to mine which is
proves to me that this is a good idea
that I'm a yes
now he says the same thing about nuclear
meaning he's a he's a little more
skeptical that nuclear can reach the
economics that it needs to but he's not
opposed to it
if it can be shown to be you know low
enough risk and high enough economics
what else do you want
do you want somebody who would say yes
let's build them uneconomically
is that what you want yeah let's build a
bunch of uneconomical things he's simply
saying if you can show me his risk-free
and economical I'm in
what's your argument with that
none it's impossible to argue with that
he's actually finding all the high
grounds on all of the all the topics
he's finding every High Ground
I I think I think he's way more
dangerous he's way more dangerous than
you know
he's so good at this all right there's I
think I had another one oh the big one
so here's the big story of the day
so he was at this town hall meeting for
news Nation Elizabeth Varga was talking
to him and they had a doctor medical
doctor stand up and ask a question and
the the essence of the question is why
are you such a nut about vaccinations
basically you didn't say that but that
was the essence of it you know science
says these vaccinations are good you say
they're not why are you such a nut right
now you know he's going to get that
question everywhere
and that he answered it perfectly
I didn't I didn't know that he could do
it now if you were with me the other day
you saw me suggesting how he should
answer that question
and I said he was not doing himself a
favor by he had a little uh a little
Mantra that he said a lot
which was he said I'm not anti-vaxx I'm
pro-science
do you remember that and I said no
that's too conceptual
because everybody's Pro science but it
doesn't give you what you think because
they just disagree with what the science
says
so I said that instead of you remember
my whiteboard presentation I said that
what he should say instead is I'm not
anti-vaxx
I agree with all Americans that we want
these better tested
and then he said that
exactly that
exactly that
he said I think all Americans agree we'd
like better testing
okay
whoa
there you are
that's all he had to do
now
now here's a really interesting part
this gets way more interesting
he claims that the vaccinations were not
sufficiently tested
what does what do all the scientists say
but they were
why are you lying they were tested
and they says double-blind Placebo tests
and then the scientists say that's what
we did that's exactly what every single
thing did everything you're complaining
about double blind
so then somebody explained to me today
so he tells it he tells the story about
challenging Dr fauci to present him even
one example just one where that's true
and and he says that they finally gave
him an official document after he sued
from health health and human services
that could not produce one
he actually challenged the government to
show any evidence that the vaccinations
had been tested
adequately
and they had no response
now how could it be true that everyone
thinks they were tested in all the right
ways science should test
and yet they can't produce it and RFK Jr
who's who's not crazy he's not crazy he
says they don't exist and nobody can
show them to you do you believe that
all right here's what I think is going
on and this is based on a tweet
from some Anonymous person who had a
take on it but I think it's the right
take
and it goes like this
that if you listen to what RFK JR says
he's talking about longer term tests
whereas shorter term tests were in fact
done
so a short-term test would say we follow
this for I don't know a year or whatever
it is and we didn't see enough problems
to stop it so it's approved
I don't know if you would disagree with
that
so I don't want to talk for him but
there is there is a suggestion that they
were all tested for you know the six
month or one year whatever it is a short
term
shorter term safety tests
but it was a a full test in other words
it was randomized it was controlled it
wasn't necessarily anything wrong with
the test it was just short term
now
RFK Jr gives this following example
he says the chickenpox vaccination
I think I got the right one was in
measles
Chicken Box I think it was Chicken Box
he says the Chicken Box vaccination
definitely stopped chickenpox
so that's good
but if you look at the number of people
who are getting shingles
which comes from having this dormant
chickenpox thing in you even if you're
vaccinated you have that dormant
chickenpox the the shingles which might
occur maybe many years down the line
uh might be worse
if you're vaccinated
in other words it might have been better
just to get the chickenpox the way I did
I did the old-fashioned way I just got
the chickenpox
but now I'm not sure I'm not sure that
he's got the science right
what I'm sure of
is that we didn't do long-term tests of
the the products
so we don't know
do you know if the rise and shingles is
related to the rise of vaccinations
decades ago
I don't
I don't know
yeah and by the way you can still get
shingles if you've been vaccinated or
not vaccinated I'm sure
but apparently shingles is more
dangerous
so if you had known when you tested the
shot in the first place if you've known
that there might be because I don't know
I'm just saying that
some people say there's a correlation
that should be looking too deeper then
maybe shingles is exacerbated
by something we did decades ago
shouldn't you study that
is there any American who would not want
to know the answer to that question
is this shingle stuff related to
anything
every one of us it's the ultimate High
Ground do you want to know the answer
yes
yes
well that's all I'm offering
so he's not offering that you shouldn't
take the vaccinations or that you should
he's offering that you could know more
about them
 that guy right
yeah
well how do you how do you disagree with
them
how do you disagree with the one who
wants to give you better information
based on science
it's a tough argument
so I watched him uh turn an entire
audience to his side
now I can't read the minds of the
audience
but I watched what he said
and I can't imagine every person in that
audience didn't walk out with a
different opinion every one of them
that I I think he was persuasive
100 percent
I think he he nailed it and then he
stapled it and then he screwed it and
then he glued it like you can't hit it
you can't hit it harder than that that
was good work
and then he does it again here's more
free money
damn he's really making the other
politicians look like chimpanzees I'll
say it again every time he does some
small smart thing
you just say nobody else nobody else
could figure out how to do that
are you serious nobody else could figure
out how to do that simple thing all
right here's another one here's
something that no Democrat figured out
how to do
at least that I remember maybe you can
come up with an example
when asked about uh Trump saying that
you know he respected uh Kennedy and you
know the challenge was that they're
trying to get him to say something bad
about Trump
and he said you know here's the thing
I'm not going to say bad things about
individuals I'm just going to try to
bring people together and I'm happy that
Trump likes me or respects me or
whatever reason
big table
third table
free money
you just picked it up
I'm not even sure the Democrats need
somebody who hates Trump do that they
just want somebody to beat him
they don't care what he thinks about
them that you know they have their own
thoughts I
I feel like that was just free money
because what he did was he made his safe
for Independence and even some
Republicans
to be on his side compare that to uh
Donald Joe Biden who says that
Republicans are white supremacists
I mean that's not even that's barely
trying to be a president
compare it to uh
Hillary Clinton and her deplorables
are you kidding me
are you kidding me she said that in
public
how hard is it to not say that your
enemies are how hard is that
it's not hard
it's not hard
RFK Jr just did it he actually showed
respect
to people he doesn't agree with
it apparently is possible apparently it
can be done and what does that do to you
do you understand what that does to you
principle of reciprocity
if you're a republican he just gave you
something you wanted
and you didn't even ask for it you'd
never ask for it he gave you something
you wanted which was respect
knowing like that
he actually respected you even when
disagreeing
very strong it it causes you a
reciprocity response that's very deeply
built into your your being you know
we're built to give back when somebody
gives to us that's how civilization
works it's like the basic glue of human
civilization oh you did something for me
I guess I can do something for you
he did something for you
if you're Republican he just told you
you double sock
and how nice is it to hear that from a
Democrat it's very very nice and it cost
him nothing zero expense
third big pile of money
three tables full of free money he
picked up all three
have you ever seen that
now honestly he is exceeding Trump level
of persuasion which I didn't even think
was possible now Trump still has the the
wattage advantage
you know Trump can still you know turn
up the light in the room until you're
all blind like nobody can do that you
know he's still the king of getting your
attention and you know getting your your
emotions worked up Etc but but in terms
of just you know Straight Ahead solid
persuasion damn he's good
uh and what did Kennedy say on Biden
well he's a Democrat right Kennedy's
Democrat so obviously he's going to you
know say obviously he would say if Biden
is nominated that he would support him
right that's the obvious thing you say
he didn't say that
yep
rsk Jr
said what every one of us can see
Biden
is not ready for the job
it's just not up to him
he can see it and he doesn't have to say
it's because of age because remember
he's not he's not dissing people
just what asked if he would support him
he said we'll have to see
we'll have to say
think about that
he just said something that's obvious
and true but we were trying to deny it
his own party has tried to deny that
that they don't notice
the Biden really he doesn't have the
capability to do anything much less
present he's he's Beyond his uh sell by
date
and that is not personal that's not
personal he's just past his cell by date
if I had a choice of uh you know Trump
as president or someone who is you know
similarly
effective
I would take the younger one
so I'm going to say the same thing about
Trump as I do about Biden now Biden's
you know he's gone
Trump still looks like he has everything
going for him but he's at a certain age
you got to play the odds right
so
so I would say his opinion on Biden is
exactly right again it's exactly right
you wait and see
because here's the thing he's not saying
what if Trump gets some legal problems
and it's ramaswami versus Biden
just think about this
if you're RFK Junior
and in a hypothetical world where it
ended up being
ramaswamy against Biden and you know
could happen
who do you think he'd back
who do you think RFK Jr would actually
prefer
to win the presidency
ramaswami or Biden
I actually don't know the answer to the
question
I don't know because I think he'd like a
little bit about what both offered but
would be worried about Biden's age of
course
so
it was the perfect answer because it's
accurate it's honest it comes across as
honest you don't think he's gaming the
system
you really think that he's got an issue
there and that's what I want to hear I
want to hear that he's got an issue with
his own leadership doesn't even have to
be specific it's all good all right
um did you see the latest video of Biden
trying to form full sentences and it
didn't work out at all
it feels like a repeat I would play it
for you but now you've heard so many
times that he's he confused uh Ukraine
with Iraq twice in the last few days
I mean he's just gone he's completely
gone
but you'll be happy to know that Ron
DeSantis made some news today Ron
DeSantis
um so the Rhonda says news is uh he just
announced that he would uh he would
abolish the Departments of
education
energy IRS
so that was pretty exciting
he knows how to light up a room that Ron
DeSantis does
now I mocked around DeSantis for being
boring because he is
but I will say again I have never been
more optimistic about the country
so long as Biden is out of office
you know because I'd be happy with RFK
Jr even if I don't agree with some of
his stuff I would be completely happy
with ramaswamy as my president and I
would be quite happy with the with Ron
DeSantis
I could live with Iran DeSantis
presidency
I'd be okay with that because he's very
effective
um Newsome I just don't think he has
substance
yeah he could end up being the president
there's definitely a path for him but I
feel that if you've got a
see this this is what I love about this
year
RFK Jr and Vivek
may not get to the final competition
there's a good chance they won't right
according to the experts not according
to me
but don't you think they're already
changing the arguments
don't you think they've shown us the way
right you you can now see where we need
to go
because both of them are painting a very
clean picture of younger more rational
uh you know less corrupt government
they've both given you a picture of that
and I think both could deliver that or
at least they'd try like hell
so I think that makes the the people who
are leading in the polls
have to modify their game
if if you're if you're a Democrat now
imagine being a Democrat and and knowing
that you're maybe Champion is Biden
that's your guy and you're up against
ramaswamy maybe the smartest person
who's run for president
like you know in my lifetime maybe might
be the smartest person who ever ran for
president who is also smart and
effective I can actually do things in
the real world
that's amazing
um how about RFK Jr
well I don't know what he is but he's
certainly brilliant
he's he's persuasive like all get out
and you know he's a Kennedy so maybe he
gets that he gets that honestly
um Carter was smart but he wasn't Rama
Swami smart I don't think so
I mean I may be wrong but I don't think
so I think he's unique
and
I don't I just feel great about the ones
who are pushing the ones on top
but I don't really think we're we're
well served by
very old men in the presidency all right
some other news here uh just an update I
was telling you there may be a number of
reasons why there's more trans
people uh some of it might be where
they're just feel safer coming out some
of it might be the I don't know the food
supply some of it might be that
who knows might be several different
reasons we don't know but there's a
weird correlation I don't know if you
knew this between Autism and trans
did you know that
people with Autism are more likely or
people on the Spectrum I guess are more
likely to be trans
like a lot more likely
what does that tell you about if
anything does it tell you anything about
what trans is
I mean I I think if if autism and trans
are linked that would suggest that
there's a brain difference
and maybe they have some you know common
common part of the brain that they
operate through or something
but it would suggest that people are in
fact what they say they are
not all I mean you could it's clear to
me that some people are being socially
manipulated into a point of view they
wouldn't have not held naturally but I
think we all agree there's probably
something real
I don't we don't know the percentage
oh to the trans you know the trans
situation that there are people born
with brains that are somehow out of sync
with their bodies
and that they're looking for ways to fix
it and if they're adults I wish them
locked and you know all the support I
could give
um
but I just think it's something you
should know though autism and trans are
linked because that that does give you
maybe
um I'm hoping
the reason I bring it up is maybe give
you a little more empathy
because I'm not sure that on the right
especially there's I don't think there's
quite the level of empathy
that is appropriate to the situation
because I think there are so many people
who are outrageously don't look like
it's organic that they're they're
they're taking all your attention away
from there are some individuals who are
born on the Spectrum there's some people
who are born with this
this gender dysphoria
and I don't think you should throw them
under the bus
because there's some other people who
are outrageous
so
that's my little uh
social good for today all right
um I was watching the Steve Kirsch who's
a big skeptic of vaccinations I'll say
skeptic
and he was uh talking about how the
Amish he makes this claim that the Amish
don't have the same rates of
autism and ADHD and maybe something else
and he was suggesting that they because
they also don't get vaccinated
that is pretty clear that the
vaccinations are a causation of these
things that seem to only happen to
vaccinated people
now uh he might be on to something
he might be
but I'm not buying it
now I'm not buying it
because the Amish have too much that's
also different
there's too much difference number one
how many you sat on the shoulder
a lot a lot of fat are Amish people
probably not
how much uh processed foods do the Amish
eat they eat a lot of processed foods
probably not do they have the same
exposure to lead
in their environment are they stiffen
paint and
probably not as much
how about uh just pollution
pollution do you think that where the
Amish live is as polluted as where the
rest of us live
probably not
probably not do you think that the Amish
sit in chairs as many hours as the rest
of us do you think they sit in chairs
probably not
they're probably active most of the day
right so basically you see the Amish
doing every
you know just about every healthy thing
you could possibly think of
do you think the Amish are on their
phones all day you ever see the Amish
this is not an Amish person
this is everybody who's not Amish
right
don't you think all of that stuff is bad
for you
so Steve curse Steve curse is very smart
and he's looked into it far more than I
have so I don't want to say he's wrong
I'm not going to say he's wrong but I'm
going to say the argument isn't Landing
because there's just too much that's
different here's another thing that's
different about the Amish are you ready
they're genetically similar
how about that
yeah you don't think there are some
things that some some genetically
similar groups of people who would have
less
less problems with than other people
right yeah how much uh sickle cell
anemia is affecting the Amish
are they having a big problem with the
Sickle Cell No no because there are some
things that just don't affect you based
on your genetics so there's just too
much going on there but Steve Kersh is
very smart he's looked into it so I'm
not saying he's wrong I'm just saying
persuasion wise that wasn't coming
across to me
all right aspartame might get banned or
not not banned I might uh might be
labeled a possible carcinogen
is that the least surprising thing
you've ever heard in your life
the least surprising thing
I I thought we
I thought we'd heard bad things about
aspartame for years but maybe they had
not been proven
oh so that's happening all right here's
another uh here's another one for you I
saw
I saw a statistic that said 20 percent
of gen Z is lgbtq
20 of gen Z so that's people under 25.
um do you see any problems with how they
gather the statistics
any problems because in the recent years
the number of lgbtq is zoomed just in
recent years
uh let me mention one problem
lgbtq includes the B
for bisexual
you know all women are bisexual now
right
ha I'm exaggerating it's not all women
of course let me tell you the most
common female opinion I hear under 25.
you ready this is the most common under
25 female View
um are you hetero or are you gay I'm
hetero totally hetero
so you wouldn't you know you wouldn't
have sex with a woman
oh well
I mean
it's not my first choice but yeah I mean
if I met somebody and they were like
really hot I mean I could see it
happening
you know so so theoretically even though
you're a hetero you're saying if you met
the right woman you could be in a
relationship with her oh yeah yeah in
fact uh when I was younger I had a long
relationship with a woman
but you're hetero yeah
how do you even determine who's bisexual
in 2023 in 2023 the most common answer
under 25 is it doesn't matter if they're
male or female
if I fell in love I fell in love
that's the end of my story
so is that by
what is that
I I have a feeling that
there may be some number of people
young women in particular who are
identifying as bi
who in in another time would have
identified as hetero
I'm not sure of that the only thing I'm
sure of
is that young women will say out loud
with no embarrassment yeah I would I
could have a relationship with a woman
at the same time they'll tell you
they're completely heterosexual
so it doesn't even so bisexual doesn't
mean anything in 2023.
so it's not even a category
so I don't know so so one possibility is
they're just uh more women in particular
who say they're bisexual
right do you think that that could be
part of not all of it do you think that
could be a part of why that the lgbtq is
big if you took the B out I wonder what
it would look like
that's all I'm asking I just if you just
take the bisexual out just take a look
see if that looks different it might
look different
yeah the prisons are full of it exactly
um let's talk about pregosian so it's
dangerous to be a general over in Russia
lately so there's a rumor that the
leader of I think the Air Force Russian
Air Force is saravican
may or may not have been in on the plot
with pregosian and now saravican has
disappeared
meaning he's not in public and then
there's another General
what's his name uh
chief of general staff
Valerie
gerasimov and he has not appeared in
public lately either
so the Kremlin Watchers are looking at
the generals who seem to be disappearing
and they're they're assuming that Putin
is doing some purging he's trying to
figure out who was on the other side and
getting rid of him so that's probably
happened
and there's some
some word that saravicum knew in advance
about the Rebellion so that alone would
be sketchy if he didn't tell Putin in
advance
all right uh and that the the thinking
now in the news is that pagosian planned
to seize two top military officials you
know he was after
um
use that well I guess I guess garasimov
was one of them and the other was uh
what's his name the head of the military
over there
should I go yeah sure you by the way I'm
really enjoying uh the Russian last
names
does anybody have that experience like
in order to talk about it you have to
get their names
but I love I love all the Russian last
names they're fun to say pregosian and
and uh shigu and garasimoth
like is it my imagination or they all
they all have like awesome last names
that are fun to say
this has nothing to do with anything
it's just you know it's not true of
every language right you know German
doesn't sound like
the most pretty language
tagala
that's that's hard on the years but the
the Russian stuff I just like how they
form words and noises anyway it's
neither here nor there but um
so do you remember my uh prediction that
was the opposite of everything in the
news do you remember when uh
pagosian's personal plane took off
and then it flew to uh Belarus and then
the news said that he went to Belarus
all of the news said that and then what
did I say do you remember what I said
I said no you only know his plane went
there you're never going to see him
again
I told you you'll never see him again
his plane went there but you're never
going to see him again do you think you
would have seen him by now
if you were going to see him in Belarus
you know you don't think he would have
taken a selfie in Belarus you don't
think that there's any Source in Belarus
that could confirm that oh yeah we saw
me he was in his car anything
all right so here's how uh the Wall
Street Journal is describing it
uh I hope I wrote it down
it says well I'll just tell you what it
said I think it was the New York Times
and said today that his plane went to
Belarus
that's how they described it
his plane
went to Belarus
do you know what they're leaving out
the passengers of the plane
so so now the the news is starting to
walk it back
you could watch it happen the the news
will walk it back from uh progression
went to Belarus
to his plane went to Belarus
and that is going to be well we haven't
seen him for a while
you know the cat's on the roof
well yeah his plane hasn't been doing
much in Belarus his plate has never
taken off again
it's been dismantled for parts
that's not true but
is anybody ready to give me the win on
this or is it too early
I I say he's gone forever you'll never
see him again you'll never see him again
anybody want to take that back
because if he's in Belarus you're
totally going to see him again
now there's a story that he uh he did
not agree
to Wagner being absorbed by the military
so the Wagner group will not be part of
the military
do you know how
um do you know how we know that
progression did not agree with that
because he doesn't exist
in order to agree with something you'd
have to be in existence
or at least alive
no he did not agree
you know what would be really uh
would be shocking news if you heard he
agreed to something
if you hear he doesn't agree that could
include he's dead
if you hear he agreed to something new
well that would imply he's alive
so I'm going to predict he won't be
agreeing to anything
[Laughter]
but you might hear again
few more times that there are some
things he didn't agree to
being dead and everything that that
would contribute to is not agreeing
so I don't know if he's dad he's more
likely in prison being
interrogated to find out who all the
wouldn't you assume don't you assume
he's being tortured to find out who the
other Traders are
yeah
yes he's being tortured
to find out who the other Traders are
because you wouldn't kill him
there's no way you'd kill him until you
found out who he was working with on the
inside no way there isn't the slightest
chance Putin wanted him dead
yet
yet
but he's as good as dead
all right
um I Heard cash Patel say that uh
uh Russia would come out ahead because
they'd get all those Wagner Fighters
um maybe maybe even from other countries
where Wagner is in other countries and
they that big new fighting force of 25
000 Fighters would be joining the fight
and it would make it tough on Ukraine I
don't believe any of that
I think the Wagner group is now
irrelevant
to the fight with Ukraine
I I think there are two unorganized and
you know maybe maybe some of the
fighters will disperse but apparently
they're not they're not keen on joining
the Army because the Army would
basically just kill them
or there's a high chance to be fragged
or something
so
uh I don't see that Wagner will be a
benefit to Russia going forward at least
for a while
all right and my last point
I don't know if I agree with this or not
legumes are really good for you
and if you eat lots of legumes you would
be like the people who live to a hundred
so apparently there are a number of
places around the world
where uh where they lived over a hundred
far more likely than in other places and
apparently one of the things they have
in common these long-living people is
legumes
beans and garbanzo beans are especially
good I guess and then it said garbanzo
beans have lots of magnesium
what
I'm starting to think magnesium is is
like the
it's like the secret to life or
something
so uh get your
fart-filled legumes and
you know what I need here's what I need
um I I've not looked into keto but I've
been trying to reduce my excess to
anything with sugar in it
and I feel way better
yesterday I doordashed some stuff that
was you know mostly carbs and had way
too much sugar-ish and stuff in it like
sauce and I didn't feel as good
didn't feel as good but when I eat low
sugar like just just you know broccoli
and a fish or something I feel great
feel great all day
big difference but beans are not really
like super easy
because they're either in a can and I
don't know that's a turn off to me uh or
they take a long time to you know soften
them up
so here's what I want I want a store
that only sells me food that doesn't
have sugar in it and that includes fruit
I want to walk into the store and they
just don't even sell it
it's like every single thing just
doesn't have sugar I just want that
store
is that paleo
yeah I have I I tend to not look into
the specific diets too much I mean once
once I found that Mediterranean diet was
good for you
I felt like I didn't need to know too
much more but just getting a
Mediterranean diet it's a lot of work
like I'm in California in a you know
high-end kind of a place and it's it's
hard to get healthy food
you know even if you want to pay extra
it's just hard it's just hard hard to do
anyway
the beans are good for you I like to
make sure that my audience gets
healthier and smarter every single time
they listen to me and I think today is
one of those days don't you feel
healthier and smarter already
yeah of course you do let's do a
closing sip for the YouTube people I'm
gonna say goodbye in a moment uh anybody
want to do a uh asynchronous sip sure
you do
ah
I'll uh tell you about uh Joshua lysex
book after I read a little bit more of
it
it's called Uh
so good they call you a fake which is a
great title and it fits really well
so I like I love what I'm reading so far
but I'll give you more of a more of an
update on that
um
so could they call you a fake yes so
good they call you a fake did I say it
wrong
I may have said the title wrong
all right um
all right YouTube that's all for now and
no I don't put sugar in my coffee no who
no sugar and coffee
but
