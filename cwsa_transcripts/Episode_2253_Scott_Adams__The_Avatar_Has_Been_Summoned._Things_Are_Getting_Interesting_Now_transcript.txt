good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization well
as long as it lasts and if you'd like to
take your experience up to levels that I
don't think we've seen since oh the the
some Epoch that I can't think of right
now but it would have been funny if I
could is there's something called the
upper dras period or something there
something like that but if I had thought
of that it would have been funny anyway
if you like your experience to be
maximized the younger drus there's no
older
drus why is there no older drus if
there's a younger dras
period Well I don't know that's why you
use a towel for to dry your ass but if
you'd like this experience to be special
all you need is a cup or marar a glass
of tanker chel can't you drink a plastic
of vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee enjoy me
now for the unparallel pleasure the dope
of me head of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip happens now
go ah oh there is an older drus and a
younger drus all right all
right then my my reference was
correct and much funnier than younger
dras well let's talk about all the
things um Trump is the showman of all
showman and he rarely misses an
opportunity to get attention for
free so of course people have been
asking him if he'd like to be the
speaker of the house which would be a
ridiculous thing if you're running for
president would you agree it'll be kind
of ridiculous for him to be the speaker
of the house while he's running for
president on the other hand oh my God
would it would be fun and interesting
and make a story
so
naturally he he backs Jim Jordan so he's
doing the you know the reasonable thing
but then he says he'd be open to doing
it
temporarily just to unite the country
now I can't think of anything that would
unite the country less than
Trump than Trump being the speaker of
the house and of course he knows it of
course he knows it but just the fact
that he doesn't close off that option
is what makes him Trump anybody else
would have done it wrong anybody else
would have said oh no I'm running for
president I'm certainly not going to
consider that oh know that would be
crazy I Ian all my attention is running
for president I don't want to you know
disappoint my uh my supporters by you
know diverting my attention and not
being serious about running for
president I mean that would be the
obvious thing to say but no no Trump
knows that if he dangles that little bit
of possibility that he could be the
speaker of the house and then also
president and apparently it would give
him two ways to be president one would
be impeaching Biden and KL
Harris as Speaker of the House which
would make him president which would be
the most awesome thing ever but he would
never get through the Senate so is not
really a not really a serious
idea well have you noticed that a lot of
what we call politics we've been we've
been bamboozled into thinking that
mental health problems are political
opinions they're really not they're
really not now you could say there's a
fine line between being emotional and
invested and being just badshit
crazy um when I I see Rob riner's name
going by Rob ryer is not
crazy he he may have some uh let's say
interest he he does have some uh some uh
let's say
reported ties to the intelligence
community so to me it just looks like
he's doing a
job if you want to be not bothered by
Rob Riner look at his tweets and then
say to yourself he looks like he's
getting paid to do this the moment you
realize it looks like he's just doing a
job everything's fine
it doesn't bother you at
all I I do that myself he used to bother
the crap out of me i' see his tweets I
like why why why does he believe this
nonsense and then I realized he has
Intelligence connections and I thought
oh if I just looked at it like he was
being paid to tweet it wouldn't mean
anything at all that so the last several
tweets I look at him I go well suppose
you were paid for that it would look
just like that and then then everything
makes
sense but here are some topics which I
think we've uh conflated mental health
with the science and the politics
climate
hysteria climate climate change is you
know a scientific domain and it's a
political domain but not the way we talk
about it the way we talk about it is
with a mental health um attitude first
you know people are afraid and not have
having babies and you know they think
the world will end in 12 years that's
just bad mental health but it gets mixed
with this other stuff uh the whole trans
question is something real but then on
top of it a whole bunch of bad mental
health not just I'm not talking about
the people who are transitioning some of
them also would have some mental health
issues but I'm talking about the ones
the parents mostly the mothers uh a lot
of that looks like just bad mental
health playing out school shootings may
or may not have something to do with bad
mental health but sure looks like
it maybe has something to do with the
way they were treated but don't know
that for sure uh what about the
uh fact that the the Democrats are
suggesting that magga supporters are
domestic terrorists and there's a FBI
unit to look for them do you think that
could possibly happen in a country that
didn't have a huge mental health TDS
problem I mean that's just Trump
derangement syndrome right there so once
again uh mental health has been
conflated with policy because this is a
policy based on bad mental health the
idea that there's some group of Mega
people who are trying to overthrow the
country that's just bad mental
health uh how about uh mandatory
vaccinations and mandatory
masks given what we currently
know give given what we currently know
that's a mental health problem wouldn't
you say I mean there's also money
involved which is why we do anything but
the Mask Part that's not even
money that's a mental health
problem which also has a real component
to it so these are in domains that have
something real about them but the Mask
Part is pretty much a mental health
problem um how about uh the open borders
in the sanctuary cities
there are no there are no um honest
mentally healthy people who are in favor
of that none not even one and we we
pretend like these are like valid
opinions and stuff there's no valid
opinion for keeping the Border
open that's pure bad mental health Andor
the cartels are working with our
government so it's one of those things
but it's not like a policy question it's
either corruption
or bad mental
health mostly like 2third of it would be
that how about uh how about all the
drugs and the suicides bad mental health
so we're we're treating everything like
it's a policy question when we're just
like massively mentally
unhealthy and uh is it getting worse oh
maybe so apparently SE member is being
reported as the hottest
September because of climate change the
hottest September do you think that the
idea that we can measure the temperature
of the
earth and then track the average over
time is that science or is that bad
mental
health or is it bad understanding of
what can and cannot be done let let let
me say with complete
certainty nobody can track the
temperature of the earth not within a
degree or
two no no I don't believe it for one
second that we can confidently track the
temperature of the whole earth I don't
believe that for a second and if you do
you have been
brainwashed which is not to say we don't
have some kind of a warming
issue maybe we do but the fact that we
can measure the temperature within 1Â° is
sort of
hilarious uh well I found out something
more about uh that Democrat leftist
activists who got stabbed to death and
it was noted that uh he and the
journalist who got Gunn down in his home
had both uh interacted with me on
Twitter right before they died or soon
before they died now I didn't know about
either one of them because I get a lot
of critics so it's not like I'd ever
noticed their tweets I don't think I'd
ever responded to them before but I
found out uh so one of them the one that
got stabbed the first instance I saw
where he had interacted with me I
couldn't even tell if he was being a
troll or a Critic it was sort of an
obtuse kind of weird comment so I wasn't
sure so sure he was criticizing me but
uh uh Andy no found an older tweet uh in
which he had responded to something I
said that was very smart
in my opinion uh and his tweet on it was
damn this is some of the dumbest
I've ever seen that was Ryan
Carson
so uh after he said that I tweeted some
of the dumbest I've ever seen he
was uh
slain by a knife because he was in a bad
part of
town so
um I'm having a real tough time feeling
bad for people who have been my critics
because here's the thing if the only
thing that these had done had
been my critics then I would feel bad
for
them because you know somebody dies
that's worse than somebody tweeting at
you but I feel like these two people are
part of the larger problem that's
 everybody up which is letting
crime into the cities and acting like
it's okay
so
well I'm just going to tell you what my
next Target
is so since some of you believe I can
make people uh die at a distance I
thought I would do a
test so I've picked chairman shei of
China for his uh work in uh not stopping
the fenel which we assume is
intentional and within the six months
within the next six months I will be
using my psychic powers uh to give him a
grave
illness grave I'm going to work on
illness not death so he might be
attached to tubes and stuff but I'm
going to go for within six months uh I'm
going to try to take out chairman she
with my uh mental
Powers now don't tell them I'm doing
this it'll ruin the whole thing all
right so that's if you want to test my
mental ability to kill people at a
distance just check on him in the next
six
months
um I've totally turned the corner on how
upset I am about the
news and I swear to God I'm not making
this up it's all starting to look funny
to me even though it's terrible and that
even though it's probably more dangerous
than it's ever been I can't help how
funny it looks let me give you another
example uh apparently some Congress
people are sleeping in the capital
instead of walking home at night cuz a
number of them live within walking
distance do you know why do you know why
they sleep at the capital lots of times
instead of walking home it's too
dangerous it's too dangerous to walk a
few blocks to their
house too
dangerous
y
now and one of them says it would be
crazy to have a car to even own a car in
DC because it's definitely going to get
broken into or stolen
these are the people who are running the
country who are afraid to go Outdoors
because that's how well they're running
the country you're running the country
so well that you can't walk outdoors in
the capital of the
country good work
guys hey good job you can't go outside
and you can't own a car remember when
they said you won't own anything and
you'd be happy well these guys look
pretty happy and they can't own a car
and they apparently have an apartment
somewhere but they can't use it because
it's too dangerous to get to it but they
seem happy I don't know they seemed
happy is what I'm saying so I think
klouse was right they can't own a car
they can't walk to their apartment so
there's no point in owning it and they
seem happy so I think that prediction
came true won't know
anything um so you know what the irony
is if people are staying in the capital
to stay
safe that on January
6th we were worried about the uh the
politicians who were hunkered down
inside the
capital do you know what would have been
more dangerous than being hunkered down
inside the capital while a band of angry
people some of them violent were trying
to get to them what's the one thing that
would be more dangerous than
that walking to their
Apartments that's all I'm saying the
only thing that would have been more
dangerous that day on January 6th would
would have been leaving the capital and
walking to their own
apartment much more dangerous and if
they owned a car twice is
dangerous so just know that's
happening well of course we have to talk
about this wall that Biden's building
but he's totally not building but he
decided to build but he totally didn't
change his decisions and the head of the
uh uh Homeland Security mayorcas uh says
we definitely need this wall but
definitely not a wall and definitely
going to build it but definitely not
anything different and certainly it was
always in the budget but uh it's also
brand new and before we couldn't do it
but magically we
can so I would like to summarize that by
saying it's perfectly
clear have you noticed that that's what
Democrats say when they're going to give
you the biggest load of you've
ever seen in your
life it's perfectly clear that we're
totally against building walls but we're
going to build a wall because we have to
but before we didn't have to but now we
have to because it's necessary but only
we're only doing it because it's
necessary not because we have to but it
is necessary and we changed all the laws
and suspended 26 laws to get it done uh
which we could have done before but we
didn't because we couldn't but now we
can but we have the budget but we're not
building much wall so that's completely
different than building walls and it's
more like a physical structure not so
much a
wall oras I said before it's totally
clear now I would like to uh Echo what
other people said the greatest question
ever asked at a press
conference the single greatest question
of all time Peter Ducey if you didn't
see it it's one for the
ages because we know that uh Biden tore
down all of Trump's wall he wasn't even
he wasn't even willing to keep it where
it was where it was already built he had
to tear it
down now he says his feelings about
walls have not changed but but legally
he's required to build it you see where
this is going Biden says legally I'm
required to build it because it's in the
budget but apparently it's also the Le
it's also legal to tear one down
CU he's done it and nobody complained
right it's completely legal to tear it
down but he's required to build
it so he has to build it but he doesn't
want it and he has a pattern of tearing
him down when he doesn't want it so
Peter Ducey asked the following
question once you build the wall are you
going to tear it
[Applause]
down it's the greatest question ever
asked Peter Ducey for the win oh my God
just the best question
ever uh and do you know how that was
answered to be clear to be perfectly
clear we've been over this we've been
over this to be perfectly
clear um you uh I have not talked to the
president about this we're not going to
talk about this Peter we're not going to
talk about this no no no you had your
chance we're not going to talk I'm
moving on that's it that's it moving on
I've been perfectly clear we've been
over
this and
see all right uh let's see what's going
on uh Mike Lindell five of his employees
are being
audited obviously as a punishment for
supporting Trump Trump's got 91
indictments obviously
politically um motivated I saw a
compilation clip of
latia what's her last name
latia James Leticia James and I saw her
publicly saying that they had to stop
Trump like in public multiple times must
stop Trump must stop Trump then she gets
into office and makes up some ridiculous
charges to get Trump how in the world is
she not immediately removed from her job
how in the
world even if Trump did lots of bad
things there's no way in hell that one
specific person who has a history of
saying she's going to take him down and
obviously looked for a crime before
there was reason to look for a
crime and oh my God and then of course
Ela musk is being
investigated in every way that the
government can so can we say that the uh
government that the um the government is
weaponized against the public I'd say
yes uh before I didn't you know I
thought it was just some uh special
cases I thought well that's a bad
situation or there's a special case over
there but we have I think we've reached
the point where if you are a supporter
of the
president president Trump um that that's
enough because the FBI literally started
a group that's organized just to find uh
and try to stop or suppress Trump
supporters Mega extremists they're
calling them but they're basically just
you know drump
supporters
so that's bad
um here's some more uh
fun uh Robin
D'Angelo uh she wrote what white
fragility so she's one of the leaders in
the all white people are racist and she
said this recently all white people's
households are racist now she's white
you should know she says all white
people's households are racist and that
she talked about herself and she says
she isn't any less or more racist than
anyone else and that includes Donald
Trump so the number one spotter of white
racism says Donald Trump is no more or
less racist than she
is does that sound
like like she softened on that point a
little
bit I mean maybe you should have started
with that may maybe say that first
that's not the last thing you say
because we've been dealing with you know
being called racist for what ever since
her book came out and now she says oh no
more than anybody else
okay
okay well we have to talk about Hillary
who did an interview and she said that
uh Trump's followers are cult members
who need to be
reprogrammed formally
reprogrammed does that sound like uh
 Hitler it does yeah so she
finally went full Hitler
now let me be clear I never I don't like
to say anybody would Hitler unless they
do actually something that Hitler
did but this looks like something Hitler
did didn't Hitler identify a part of his
own public and then demonize
him that's sort of exactly what he
did now I believe you could call
somebody Hitler if they do exactly what
Hiller did so this is Hiller like you
know she hasn't done the death camps yet
but if you want to know who is who is
alarmed by this
language Brian
stelter now retired from CNN but he's
still Brian stelter he tweeted on uh to
the to her comment he tweeted uh what
would quote formal deprogramming look
like in other words even he's
alarmed even the CNN guy is like wait a
minute formally
deprogrammed in the United
States so if you want to know what going
too far looks
like it's that that would be going too
far however what does it mean when uh
Hillary does a public call for Trump's
uh supporters to be
reprogrammed what is the uh there's a
ramification of
that Hillary has summoned the
Avatar now if you don't know that
reference I'm not going to explain
it if you know you know but she has
summoned the
Avatar and do you know when the Avatar
is summoned there's a specific situation
there's this very specific situation
where the Avatar is
summoned it's when the world needs to be
reprogrammed it's when their minds need
to be
changed it's when the problem in the
country is not our resources it's not a
shortage of
anything it's that our minds are minds
are broken that's when the Avatar is
summoned and uh so the avatar has been
summoned and it's came on the country
needs to be
reprogrammed the uh Democrats think the
problem is the Republicans Republicans
think the problem is the Democrats and
the Avatar knows it's
both so that's why you need an avatar so
wait for that um MSNBC says that Elon
Musk has turned the xplatform into a
Haven for
bigotry a Haven for bigotry so I'm going
to draw a picture now of the full extent
of the evil that is now coming upon us
and it's pretty extreme I've never seen
anything like
it so MSNBC a major Network which is
sometimes uh people say is associated
with our intelligence operation in the
United States is calling Free Speech
bigotry now I would agree that Free
Speech can have bigoted elements but
that's not what's going on here this is
a full call for
censorship and the censorship would
apply to people that the good people the
MSNBC hosts or the people on The View or
Joe Biden have labeled as the bad
people those would be the bigots so
whenever they talk is bigotry whenever
whenever the other side talks it's just
good honest science but once they can
label you as the bigots which uh which
Hillary has done and Joe Biden has done
as well so the first the first step is
to label some group and then you have to
label them as bigots because once you've
labeled them as bigots you can restrict
their free
speech you can also eliminate their
ability to earn money in the economy
so that that's largely what's
happening but you also want the uh the
justice system and our investigative
arms of the country to be on board with
this because you wouldn't want to be on
the wrong team right you need to be all
on board so indeed the FBI literally is
targeting Mega people so now you've got
the government
weaponized in a variety of ways they're
auditing people they're um they're
targeting magga people
they're jailing j6 people there's a very
clear pattern of Democrats jailing
Republicans for whatever they can get
them for which would make it haunted
exactly the best prediction ever
made
um however there's a interesting thing
happening right now which is if RFK Jr
runs for
president and third party long before
the actual election itself he will know
for sure because there'll be lots of
polling whether he's hurting or helping
which candidate so if we assume that
he's not in a place to win win outright
and he might be he could actually win
outright but if he's not in a place to
win outright and it looks like it's not
going to happen he would have the
ability to either stay in the race and
he would know in advance who that would
get elected let's say it's Trump might
not be but let's say it is and then he
would know that if he dropped out before
the election
itself that that would reverse and maybe
it would make Biden the
president so RFK Jr might be the only
person who matters he might be able to
determine the next president by choice
not just because of what he's doing but
a month before the actual election if he
looks at the polls he can just decide
who's president
and if I were him I would put a price
tag on
that and I would
say Trump if you want to be president
I'll stay
in but I'd like to be attorney
general
because RFK Jr is the only attorney
general who could kick as much ass as
needs to be kicked without it looking
like a um Nazi Republican takeover over
you would almost have to have a democrat
in there he's the only Democrat who
would have no
mercy am I right for him it's personal I
mean he's not going to say that but
obviously it's personal his family was
killed Maybe by some of those people you
know the descendants of them not the
same
people
so uh all of you say hey RFK Jud would
be a good vice president for Trump
zero chance of that happen it's a stupid
idea it's a stupid idea do not pair a
Democrat and a republican on the same
ticket I don't care if it's Trump and
RFK I don't care who it is terrible
stupid terrible terrible idea stop
saying it stop tweeting it terrible
terrible stupid stupid stupid worst idea
ever
but Attorney
General
I could see that because I actually
would trust RFK Jr to follow the law I
would actually F I would actually trust
he would follow the law and I'm not sure
I would trust too many other people at
the
moment so that could happen that's
interesting if you didn't see that
coming well let's talk about the Trump
and the nuclear submarine story so the
story as it's developing goes like this
there's this Australian billionaire
who was also a member of mar Lago and I
guess knows Trump fairly well has for a
long time and
allegedly the uh and there was a
question of Australia buying some
submarines from the US so that was an
open question at the time that this
allegedly happened and what allegedly
happened was that Trump said too much uh
there were no documents involved but the
allegedly Trump told this billionaire
too much about
uh how many Warheads are on a
sub and how close our subs can get to
Russian Subs without Russia knowing
it and therefore it was a terrible
security
breach and it's all bad
now what does this have what does this
story have with it that reminds you of
some other
story let's see we've got the Australian
connection first
huh just like uh sort of how the Russia
collusion hoax was right there was a
Australian
element right so Australian
billionaire um we've got the Russian
element because it's allegedly how close
we can get to Russian Subs didn't say
Chinese Subs said Russian Subs why not
just Subs in
general well
Russia Russia is a little more red
meat uh then it's a of course it's a
nuclear secret so that's like the
ultimate you know right on the nose
don't you think they've been looking for
those documents you remember I said if
there were any nuclear secrets in those
documents at Maro we would know that by
now they wouldn't tell us details but
they but by now somebody would have said
well there were some nuclear documents
that were really sensitive if there
were
because that would be the big story that
would
leak um so we've got a lot of elements
here we've got uh I don't believe there
are any documents or
Witnesses so although it's not an
anonymous source those are the worst
it's a a real Source who's telling you
the story sounds reasonably
credible but can you trust any one
person telling you a story in a
political
environment not
really uh
but here's the question that the Press
will never deal with so
what they're going to make you think
past the
sale the they're trying to make you
think that it was a bad
thing but that makes you think past the
question of what if Russia found out for
the first
time uh that Trump said how close our
submarines can get let's just take take
it one at a time let's say that happened
then secondly imagine uh imagine that
Russia thought they knew but they were
off by a mile or
so I don't I don't know what distances
we're talking about but could they be
off by a
mile would that make any difference to
their
strategy what would be different what
would they do differently if they knew
how stealthy our submarines
were I can't think of anything they
would do differently because they
already know that they're hard to
track and they already know that we got
a number of them but they don't know how
many so they certainly know we can reach
their Homeland with nukes right if if
they know we can reach their Homeland
with
nukes then you have complete you know
mutually assured destruction if you if
you tweak that a little bit it's still
mutually sure Destruction for example uh
allegedly Trump said something about the
number of warheads on the sub do you
think Russia didn't know that the
submarines can carry uh nuclear multiple
Warheads now if they thought the number
was probably 30 but the real number was
40 or vice versa will that change their
strategy how would it how would it make
any difference at
all so it might be true that Trump said
these things and I would agree that he
should not have said those things if he
did but let's be serious about whether
it matters I doubt it and secondly would
do you think the Russians would take
Trump's word for it knowing he's the
most
hyperbola
hyperbole you know producing guy in the
world and it was in the context of
trying to sell submarines to
Australia now
imagine for a
minute that Trump is trying to sell you
something anything in this case it was
submarines do you think you would say
things about those submarines that were
slight exaggerations of their
capabilities well that would be
predictable wouldn't it do you think
that if the submarines could I'll just
pick a number randomly do you think if
they had 40
Warheads that Trump would say they have
40
Warheads
or would he say something like oh those
things they they could have 40 50 60
Warheads you know if you want to buy
something with 60 Warheads on it that's
how he talks yeah he would mention the
first number the real one but then he
would act like it was really a bigger
number that's his style oh yeah the the
these submarines you could put 40
Warheads on there 4050 if you wanted to
you could put 60 Warheads on there right
that sounds exactly like him doesn't it
you could could have billions and
billions of warheads on there and then
how about the exaggeration of how close
they could get suppose the real number I
don't know what the real number of a
submarine would be that they can get
within a mile without being
detected do you think you would say they
can get within a mile without being
detected and he would leave it at that
or would he say these are so stealthy
they can walk right up to the exhaust
pipe of another Uh Russian submarine
won't even know it we could be 10 ft
away you'll not even know we're there wh
which would sound more like
Trump the the the least likely
possibility is he gave real numbers for
either of those two things that is the
lowest level of possibility now imagine
that you're Russian intelligence and you
get this
report we we've got the number of
warheads on their
submarines we thought it was 30 but it
could be 50 or
60
so what do you do
differently do you think if Russia could
build a better submarine they would I'm
sure they would do you think if they
could do something to you know build a
an umbrella of
Defense I'm sure they would have done it
already right what what what what are
they going to do that's
different if they if they heard this
because they wouldn't believe it would
they yeah imagine imagine going to your
boss and saying yeah we got the number
of warheads from
Trump is the boss going to say well that
sounds pretty credible or is the boss
going to say who Trump you mean the guy
who failed the factchecking 35,000 times
during his first tour yeah him we got
that the facts from
him all
right I don't know not too
dependable
all right um nukes in space so
apparently locky Martin wesing house uh
government services and intuitive
machines so they got some big uh
Government funding to build uh small
nuclear um power plants for space
force how many of you remember when
space force was first
cread and I was telling you that if you
want a new nuclear you know um if if we
have any hope at all of controlling
space militarily which we're going to
need to that we would have to go strong
with nuclear because that's the obvious
way you would power a
spaceship and and I
said that that should it should be part
of our larger domestic energy program
because you need to develop people who
have the skill to build nuclear
facilities otherwise there's nobody to
build build it for your
military so credit to the Biden
Administration they appear to be funding
uh you know Trump's space force and they
appear to be funding it in the most
rational way which is nuclear power so
it is weird
that they're sort of below the the level
of
notice even the Democrats know that
nuclear power is going to be the thing
right it just has to be the thing so
they just can't say it really loudly
because it would work against their
climate change
alarmism and do you think that the
climate change models included space
force as one of the
variables no but space force is going to
create a domestic small nuclear reactor
industry lots of expertise there'll be
lots of
advancements and that alone would be
probably uh one of the
biggest contributors to reducing our
load of fossil
fuels so it could be that space force is
the single biggest variable to end
climate
change and who was it who told you that
from the start I did here it is one of
my better predictions but it's all good
news for the country so nuclear is
coming uh China developed a pretty
Advanced microchip which has people
worried cuz if China can make their own
microchips uh then they're in a better
better space militarily and economically
the current situation is they buy a lot
of their microchips from American chip
makers
and uh we don't sell them the best stuff
so we can restrict the best stuff but
the argument goes that if we completely
stop selling chips to China and there's
some talk about that the chip makers who
want to sell those chips are saying no
that's shortsighted if you if we don't
sell chips to China they're going to
build their own chip making facility and
then it will be Advanced and they'll
have any chip they want and then we're
in real trouble to which I say that
sounds like something that you say when
you're trying to prevent somebody from
competing with you that doesn't sound
real because if China want wanted
Advanced chips and had the ability to do
it themselves they would be working
overtime to do it
themselves do you don't think China
wants Advanced chips that we won't sell
them of course they do if there was if
there were any way they could make it on
their own they'd be doing it and trying
as hard as possible to do it apparently
they think they can't or they or they
are working on it and they'll get there
no matter what we do but I don't think
whether they buy from us or not that's
going to stop them from trying to make
advanced chips it's the dumbest argument
ever all
right
um so there's a story about the uh the
two of the s caloa brothers El Chapo's
kids who run at least part of the what
was the caloa cartel
and there's reports that I think I would
I would wait for a confirmation of this
to know it's true
but uh reports that they're they're
trying to shut down the fenel business
within their own uh cartel and that
they've actually tortured and murdered
people who who didn't take their
instructions and shut down the fenel now
I don't know if any of this is true and
if it is
true you know maybe there's a bigger
context we don't know but I wouldn't be
surprised if we haven't worked down some
kind of a deal cuz the cartel does not
want our military to go in there cuz if
the military goes in they're out of
business and
dead but if they simply back off from
the one thing that's uh killing the most
Americans and they go back to just
cocaine and
heroin then in theory they could just go
back to being super
profitable uh but without the risk of
our military getting
involved so it could be that the we
worked on a deal with them it could be
they're just being smart and they know
that that that kind of business can't
last forever as soon as we get a
Republican president the military is
going in I
think would you agree the the moment we
get a Republican president special
forces are going to be all over the
cartels I
think so the cartels probably seeing
that coming are trying to get out of the
business to discourage our military from
needing to go in but they don't control
the other cartels or even all of their
own cartel at the moment so I don't see
any way we're not going in because even
if one cartel makes less of it the
others will make more so I think we're
going
in um are you watching the big story
with OIC I guess it's a diabetes drug
but it also is associated with losing
weight it's like quite expensive um but
some are saying has side effects and
some are saying it's a
godsend some are saying that you lose
weight but it's not the weight you
wanted to lose it's the wrong kind of
weight I don't know if any of that's
true
but do you believe the safety claims of
big Pharma about OIC or I don't know who
makes it but would you believe any
safety claims they make I wouldn't no
because I don't believe in any
medications
anymore and by the way don't listen to
my medical advice do not listen to my
medical advice it'll get you killed
really really don't listen to any of my
advice I'm just telling my personal
opinion I just don't trust any any
Pharma Pharma drugs at
all some of them surely make a
difference and save your
life but I'm not sure about it I don't
know which ones and I don't know if this
is one is this one that's saving
people's lives by you know saving them
from obesity or is it just another
reason that they don't have to
exercise I don't know it feels like it
might be another reason to not
exercise all right I'm going to read you
a long Robbie Starbuck
thread uh that starts with understand
what time it is in America which is sort
of a perfectly written introduction so
the these are a bunch of quick bullet
points but together they form a picture
that might be
alarming all right so this is Robbie
starbu on the xplatform he says uh Trump
is being prosecuted by Biden's regime
plus multiple state level Democrats true
Trump is being politically persecuted
the head of you know the leading
candidate politically persecuted in
America in
2023 that's that's a thing you can say
just as matter of factly and people
won't even argue the facts of it you
know a Democrat would say but but these
are real but they know they're
not
um Robbie goes on every agency in
government has been weaponized to
investigate Elon
Musk
true um Newsweek just broke the story
about the FBI is both investigating
Trump voters and treating them like
terrorists by using the same tools they
created to fight
Isis the DHS Department of Homeland
Security and and CA cisa use proxies to
censor influencers like Robbie Starbuck
uh and Charlie Kirk for opposing
Democrats so in the real world there was
a secret government program to decrease
the voice of some Republican types a
real thing in
2023 um grandmas including one with
cancer who thought they were allowed in
the Capital after police waved them in
were thrown in prison after January 6th
despite zero violence meaning that the
people thrown in prison some of them had
zero violence now none of that's
cool absolutely none of that is
cool Soros daas are releasing pedophiles
and criminals to carry out record crime
true over 7 million illegal immigrants
have entered our country under Biden and
then Robbie puts that in context listen
into this context only 14 states have
entire populations that are more than 7
million did you know
that and of our 50 states there were
only 14 of them that their native
population is greater than the number of
immigrants we've let in in a year or
under Biden I guess under
Biden that's a lot of
people schools are grooming kids about
so-called social justice gender identity
and sexual topics including books with
porn in them while hiding it all from
their parents there's no lie there right
there's no
hyperbole that is a straight statement
of
fact uh people fear saying they vote
Republican despite Republicans winning
the 2022 popular vote because they know
they can lose
what Republicans won the 2022 popular
vote that didn't happen did it
what oh 2022 right I'm sorry I was
thinking of
2020 all right so yes his point that you
can't even tell people you vote
Republican um doctors are giving kids
sex changes with the full support of the
White House including on children of our
troops true doctors lose their licenses
over disagreeing with The Narrative of
the
Democrats on several different topics
true on several different topics and not
being wrong which is important they're
not wrong they're just disagreeing with
the
government um I mean some of them might
be
wrong Banks big Tech and online
transaction Services have banned
prominent influencers for the crime of
being conservative well there's a little
hyperbole there but not much they
basically are banned for their politics
so that's
true um inflation and interest rates are
destroying our economy and ways that
we'll be dealing with for over a
decade 80 to 90% of Congress represent
their own interests and lobbyists
instead of people that does feel like
the right percentage I was thinking
about this
myself and I do think that there are
honest people in
Congress about
10% 10 to 20% that would have been my
estimate as well well so we don't know
that but that's that's just what it
looks like and feels like uh big tech
companies manipulate what the public
sees to sell the Democrats narrative
correct yeah so our online experience is
rigged our government experience is
rigged our schools are rigged soldiers
were fired by the thousands for being
conservatives who didn't want the co jab
they even denied chaplain's religious
exemptions wow people are put through
public strugg struggle sessions if they
say men can't be
women true the Doga and Democrats Das
are deploying lawfare to bankrupt
prominent Trump officials and
supporters uh the process is the
punishment true so it doesn't matter if
they're convicted it only matters
they're put through hell and
bankrupted
true college kids won't get into schools
if they express any conservative views
and many will be failed in classes if
professors find out they're
conservative
true that these are real things in the
current year parents were treated like
terrorists by mer Garland and the doj
for protesting School boards over coid
and the sexualization of
children uh professional programs to
become doctors and nurses are adding
steps to screen for ideology to
eliminate conservatives many do it in
sneaky ways uh doctors do this with
requirements to get the CO vac in order
to get a
residency well that is sneaky some
states pass laws to take custody from
parents who don't affirm the new gender
identity of their kids and even
legalized kids running away from their
state to get an abortion or sex change
true BLM and antifa members received
multi-million dollar settlements after
burning down cities with riots and looy
for a year because their modern day
brown shirts that the Democrats had to
reward to ensure they'll do it again in
the future okay uh and Robbie says our
future is closer to Russia under Stalin
Cuba under Castro China under Mao or
Venezuela under
Maduro uh than we are to our
constitution um and he says Americans
won't survive unless Republicans uh get
serious and ruthless as he says
ruthless well don't take the Ruth
ruthless to mean anything violent
nothing like that but uh certainly
they're going to have to try
harder
and here's what I really think we ought
to
do we should challenge Democrats to
debates
one-on-one and it doesn't matter who it
is it could be just you know their
champion of the day our champion of the
day and have some kind of a moderator
who can stop the Democrat from
interrupting because you know how that
works right as soon as a conservative
talks to any any Republican the as soon
as the Republican starts to answer the
question the Democrat will bark at them
to stop them from answering and then ask
another question and then when they try
to answer either one of those questions
the Democrat will bark and ask a third
question to just keep keep them from
Talking they obviously know they don't
don't have arguments
obviously other words otherwise they
would lead with argument if they had one
so how do we get
Democrats to be dumb enough to agree to
debate with people who actually know
what they're talking
about how do you do that but that needs
to be where this goes it needs to go the
direction of let's put it under a
microscope let's let's see who wins now
what I heard that the Republicans didn't
allow V and Chris Christie to have their
own little private debate I said to
myself oh my God we're
 you never tell anybody they can't
debate anybody just because they're in
your club oh such a mistake I
mean the head of the RNC should just be
fired for that
alone um yeah I mean literally the
Republicans are desperately trying to
maintain freedom of speech and the
argument is that even though you you can
move your lips you know that's legal but
if there's some system such as you know
a social media platform that's
preventing you from taking your message
forward that in effect is like curbing
your free speech in effect and then the
Republicans do it to their own their own
candidates they became the like the
social media platform influence that
told somebody they can't talk to
somebody else in public amazing
amazing so how do we do it that's the
thing that has to be solved how do we
get a good
moderator with uh two people who
actually are willing to
debate uh I would argue that your
best uh your best best scenario would be
uh a pundit who thinks they actually are
right somebody who's in the job of being
a pundit but could use a little extra
attention
well I don't do you think Phil bump will
ever agree to be to talk to anybody who
disagrees with him
again I don't think so now Jen is a Jen
is a possibility because he said he
might run for president right so Jen
might actually be willing to talk to
somebody Bill Mah would be an imperfect
one because he's not exactly on board
with the Democrat stuff to begin with
you want somebody who's on board with
their own stuff and I think it would
take you about a second before they just
started yelling at
you Oprah isn't too smart to do it she
would never do
it see the the trouble is that the
highest level performance on the left
would never take the bait because they
know that their game is to control the
media their game is not to debate so you
need somebody who needs
attention but is also a Democrat so they
might throw their side under the bus no
Rob ryer would be dumb to
debate because he has everything he
wants he puts on his tweets he gets his
attention there's nothing he wants so
you got to find somebody who needs the
the extra kick the well RFK Jr no he's
too reasonable he won't disagree with
enough Gavin Nome would be interesting
you wouldn't talk to me
though
so how do we make it a
thing why don't we just say they're
afraid to
debate then they'll just say oh Trump
was afraid to debate the
Republicans which would be a good point
although you know strategy it's more
like
strategy I just saw a funny meme Jerry
Seinfeld no haraldo no haraldo is a
republican isn't
he I don't even know well he supported
Trump so he's not the one you wanted you
got to debate with somebody that the
left recognizes as their
person right now I've done what I can
because
no I'm not going to say
it there there are too fewer people to
debate with this week than there were
last
week so that's a problem they're
dropping like
flies now dtz is too
reasonable stop saying people who agree
with with Republicans there's no point
in having a debate with somebody
reasonable that doesn't oh do you think
alberman
would can you even
imagine maybe I should I should
challenge Keith alberman to a debate
he's crazy enough to do it isn't
he is he crazy enough to do it but I
think he would just be like a
yeller I don't think he could be
controlled he'd just be cutting me off
and
yelling maybe it would be better to
program to deprogram um individual
voters
I think I need to I need to do a show in
which individual uh Democrats are being
reprogrammed by me while they
watch yeah we don't want to do
professionals professionals will be too
weasly they just won't buy into the
process you need voters who would be
capable of changing their
minds yeah I I'm working it out now I
think it's got to be regular voters not
famous people
people yeah forget about all the famous
people uh you destroy their lives Oh
that's oh that is a problem isn't it if
it were a citizen who was not a pundit
or a
politician and I embarrass them on video
that would be a problem wouldn't it yeah
I don't want to ruin anybody's life just
cuz they're Hypno
IED how about all right here's what I
got to
do um I'm I'm going to offer
to let's see if I think I'll I'll tweet
out an
offer uh let's
see uh let's see I'm going to send this
uh as we
speak
looking for
a
Democrat
who
[Laughter]
doesn't who doesn't believe hypnosis is
real who
doesn't believe hypnosis is
real to agree to be
deprogrammed uh of
their
TDS in
public all right looking for a Democrat
who doesn't believe in h believe
hypnosis is real to agree to be de
deprogrammed of their TDS in
public by
me all right um I won't get any answers
to that because well well I I will get
answers but they will all be
fake uh I'll get a troll with no profile
picture saying
yes I'll get a bunch of people who are
uh just my own
followers who will say yes uh pretending
that they didn't see the part about
having to be a
Democrat so I mean I I know where this
will go there will be no legitimate good
candidates for this it just won't happen
stasel John stel would be interesting as
a debate host wouldn't
he all right do you think anybody's
going to take the
bait I believe there will be no
takers
um well this is
weird two
quotes all right yeah I don't think
we're going to get
anybody I believe it's going to be uh
crickets on that all right
everybody oo Brian
stelter oh Brian stelter
how much would you like to see me do a
zoom call with Brian
stelter oh I think I think he would be
perfect because because you know what I
you know what I believe about
Brian I believe that he actually is
open-minded you might not but I I have a
feeling about him that he was playing
you know he was playing CNN's game my
feeling is that he's actually
open-minded it's just a
feeling Sam
Harris
um Sam Harris is not as good for
this because honestly his problem looks
like uh a mental illness if I'm being
honest his problem with Trump looks like
mental illness it doesn't look like
there's some knowledge he's lacking or
something like that I think that would
be
unkind I don't want to I don't want to
go I don't want to publicly embarrass
somebody who actually has a problem to
me that looks like a mental problem I'm
no expert but I would stay away from
it made LEF his twitch streamer what
stop
streaming oh you really you got somebody
to to do
that
why would a Democrat risk their life
well because they would think they would
not be risking their life they would
think that they would be winning the
winning the debate I
guess Jim gaffan oh he'd be
interesting but I don't want to ruin his
career all right that's all for now
YouTube thanks for joining I'll talk to
you tomorrow same place
