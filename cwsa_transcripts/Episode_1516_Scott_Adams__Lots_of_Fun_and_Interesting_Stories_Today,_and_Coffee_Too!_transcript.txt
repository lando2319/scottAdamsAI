well good morning everybody
my understanding is that the youtube
stream starts about 10 seconds after i
go live in other words you know somehow
i guess you missed the first 10 seconds
if you're watching live
and that's why i stall
i stall
well boo the cat is uh
is
looking good but i have to take her back
to the vet today for a little
checkup as soon as i'm done with this
yes no sip yet no sip yet
so
how about it how would you like to make
this like a really good day a really
good day i mean to launch you into the
weekend i know i know
yeah it's going to be amazing
and all you need is a well a cup of mug
or glass a tanker jealous just like a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure oh yeah
you know it you've done it before you
know it if you're new to this well
you've got a surprise coming it's called
the simultaneous sip and despite its
ordinary sound
it's extraordinary
watch
go
yeah that made everything better
i'm always surprised when it works
well one of my favorite stories of the
day
uh i guess the rolling stones have some
concert to where they're doing and mick
jagger was in charlotte north carolina
and decided to go into a dive bar by
himself
that's right
mick jagger
walked into a dive bar in charlotte
north carolina just just by himself and
had a beer here's the funny part
nobody recognized him
the entire time he was there
including
people who had tickets to his show
now
you have to see the photo because i
think mick jagger is the one who posted
it he's just standing there alone
leaning on some kind of counter having a
beer
and as somebody in the comments noted
and it was just one of the greatest
comments
if you and i take a picture in a bar
having a beer
it looks like
a picture of you or i having a beer in a
bar
but when mick jagger takes a picture of
himself in a bar
it looked exactly like an album cover
and until you hear the comment you don't
realize it and then you look at it again
you're like
that looks exactly like an awesome album
cover
i would buy the album you have to see
the picture to see yeah it's uh with
with no effort whatsoever
mick jagger is so
permanently cool
that he just has to walk in with like a
funny hat on lean on the bar and have a
beer
and you've got an album cover how the
hell does he do that
how do you do that
just just exist and you're so cool
you're an album cover wherever you go
anyway
uh here's my story within the story
did you know that men of a certain age
are invisible
oh
oh they are
men can you back me up if you're male
and you're a certain age
nobody looks at you
you can walk down the street
with like a knife
stuck in your forehead
people will not notice
you can walk down the street
with your dick gang now i'm sorry
you know what i mean
nobody's gonna notice
because in in the way we
you know we score people's value in
society an adult male has the lowest
value
we don't even look at them
and
the first time i noticed this this was
years ago i had some laser surgery on my
face to get rid of some spider veins
and
the technology of the day was a little
less than it is now and so for weeks you
would look like you went through a
windshield
your face would be all like swollen and
purple until it healed
and you know the advice was well you
know you probably want to stay home for
a few days because it's going to be
frightening to go out and people see
your face looking all messed up like
that
that lasted about two oh they're in the
in the on local somebody posted the the
photo
let me see if i can
show this to the rest of you
all right on youtube if you haven't seen
it let's see if this works
uh over at the locals platform somebody
posted it now you tell me
that doesn't look like an album cover so
that's that's mick jagger having a beer
at a dive bar these guys over the side
no idea
no idea that they were this close
to the coolest thing that ever happened
to them in their entire life
all they had to do was stand up
and start talking to mick jagger
because he was standing there i'm sure
he would have been friendly right he
went to a bar he's not going to ignore
them
they could have just hung out with mick
jagger they didn't know they were just
five feet away
anyway something about that i just love
thank you over at locals for
posting that
um
rasmussen has a poll out uh asking
people if they believed biden or general
milley
about afghanistan and specifically the
question of whether the generals had
recommended keeping 2 500 or so people
and biden said that he had never been
advised of that
57 percent of respondents remember this
is
this is the whole country this is
democrats plus republicans
57 percent believe milli
only 21
believe biden
remember i told you about that
25
ish
like every poll seems to have 25 ish you
know give or take
but people are just whack they get every
question wrong
i believe if they took the sats they'd
get a zero
it's like 25 percent of the country
and
that's 21 believe biden how the hell do
you believe biden in that case all the
generals were on the same side it would
be the easiest thing to fact check in
the world
in the world it would be the easiest
thing you could ever fact check and 21
probably all
democrats like oh yeah i believe biden
all right
so speaking of biden and his approval
cnn is
is
ringing the alarm
there's an iowa poll
so this is just for iowa but biden is
approval has reached it an historic low
31 percent
apparently that's lower than obama or
trump ever got
so biden is is breaking records for low
approval
uh and
you know even cnn is saying ah
we have a problem here
do you realize that biden getting
elected
could end up being the best thing that
ever happened to republicans because i
don't think you could ever get to a
point where republicans controlled
everything
until you had a biden
am i wrong
until you have abide
the country isn't going to really
appreciate what the other side is
offering especially trump
and correct me if i'm wrong but isn't
almost everything worse
than under trump
i mean you could argue about the
pandemic but that was you know that was
going to happen the way it happened no
matter who was president
it feels like everything's worse
a little bit
i don't know
uh you know stock market's you know
relatively up but
that's not how you measure things
all right
i'd like to give a compliment to
somebody that i would not normally
compliment
and i i tell you that i i like to do
this as a
system you know i always tell you have a
goal have a system not a goal well if
your goal was to be unbiased
you don't have a way to do it so just
having a goal doesn't give you enough
you need a system
to be unbiased or at least as unbiased
as a human being can be right there's a
limit to how unbiased you could be
so one of my techniques which i share
with you often is to compliment somebody
you typically disagree with
just to see if you can do it
all right so here's a compliment to
cnn's chris saliza
he's an opinion guy
he does these little video packages that
appear on cnn and you you've probably
been watching him forever
so if you've ever watched chris salisa
do any kind of video presentation
most of you have seen him right if you
watch cnn
and you know it's sort of
straightforward you know the normal way
that anybody would do a video on cnn
but apparently he's uh changed his his
game
the way he does his presentation he went
big
so he's got lots of action and you know
he's just going wild and
you know lots of movement in his chair
and
just
just going big and i got to tell you
he freaking nailed it
i gotta say
and and here's your uh here's your
persuasion communication lesson for the
day
there is a when you're doing this kind
of work
meaning you're on camera
there's an illusion
also true of public speaking any kind of
public presenting there's an illusion
that happens with the presenter
and the illusion is that if i get wild
people will like me less or i'll be
embarrassed
you know something bad will happen if i
go big
so i've gotta i've just gotta
give you the facts
you know keep my arms and and the the
normal way the speaker does
just
just kind of keep it serious
but
people don't like that so the thing you
think is going to be the good
presentation is always the bad one the
thing you think is too risky just go
wild
you know just go full alex jones
it works
everybody wants to watch
something with more energy
if you bring more energy
people like it better more action more
variety
etc
um
so seliza seems to have maybe got some
advice or maybe just did it on his own
but he's really nailing it you have to
watch it it's really well done
regardless of whether you agree with his
opinion his his game is really good now
uh
panama is warning us that 60 000 haitian
immigrants are forming a caravan
to go north
to cross the border
thousand
turns out panama has been warning the us
for some time
do you remember the big story about it
nope
no you don't
you don't remember the big story about
the 60 000 people that panama warned us
for for weeks or months or however long
it's been we just found out
you just found out what your government
knew for a long time
sixty thousand haitian immigrants are
coming our way
do you think that's it that's all they
have
sixty thousand and we're done
nope
the reason sixty thousand are coming is
because fifteen 000 or whatever
percentage of them got in
they're coming because it works
as long as it works they're going to
come more i mean why wouldn't they
what is it i tell you that democrats
consistently get wrong
in the comments what do i tell you
democrats consistently get wrong and it
doesn't matter what the topic is
every topic same problem human
motivation right
they they misjudge
or don't include human motivation
and as long as you design a system
ignoring human motivation or assuming
that everybody you know does the right
thing and everybody's
you know generous and fair
you just have nonsense
i mean your your system just looks like
nonsense
all right
so that's happened i would i would think
that 60 000 immigrants coming our way
largely guarantees uh republican
victories
so
you know you might not like 60 000
haitian refugees coming across your
border illegally
but if you're a republican
you probably like the fact that it
guarantees a republican win i mean i
don't see how the republicans could lose
at this point
i mean i could be wrong right
i don't like to speak in certainties but
in terms of the where it's heading it
looks like it's heading toward a you
know just a blowout
we'll see yeah and in the comments i'm
saying that the mail-in voting might
negate that effect possibly
well
i need some confirmation to whether this
is true but i saw a video mark schneider
was
tweeting it that showed trump supporters
and black lives matter people marching
together
against vaccine mandates in new york
city
i'm a little questioning whether the
video is real
i see some people saying it's true
i i think i'm a little bit skeptical
because it didn't have like a
source on it that i saw
um
yeah well if that happens maybe it's the
beginning of
the black public
wanting to actually win for a change
let me speak to the black public
directly for a moment
i know there are a number of uh
black americans who are watching this
and
would you like to win
wouldn't you like to get everything you
want
because you know you can have it it's
like right there for you
just work with the republicans
just do it honestly
you know i mean it's hard to do right
you got historically
you got some tension there
but if you think the republicans don't
want to work with black lives matter
you're so wrong
they just want to work on the things
that you have common interest in
one of the common interests is better
schools you know get rid of the teachers
unions
but there are others
there are others if the black americans
want to win
just join the team that can help you
do you think the republicans don't want
that they do want that
they do want to do something that's
really useful to the black community
because it helps them it's good for
getting elected why wouldn't they like
that they also like americans
surprise
surprise republicans like americans
and if americans
you know happen to be you know
god-fearing well it's a bonus
and if they happen to
respect the constitution and
think that working for a living is a
good idea
you're all good
you're all good
right
you you if you're black you would be
amazed how little your color matters to
a republican you really would now does
it matter in a social way is it you know
on the front of their mind yeah probably
because we're all we're all conscious of
racial racial stuff but in terms of
decisions and choices they make and
hiring decisions and anything else
policy
yeah
they care that you're an american they
care that you
you know love the constitution
love the country if you do all that
stuff you're good with the republicans
every time
monica lewinsky has some new controversy
turns out there's a woman who claims
that monica lewinsky slept with her
husband before she even slept with
clinton
and now
i have a question for you
if this is true and it sounds credible
you know you have to be skeptical of
anything these days but it sounds
credible
if she in fact
ruined two marriages by sleeping with
two different husbands
shouldn't the story be about what a
piece of she is
like why are we treating her as the
victim
is that sexist
you know i get that there's a gigantic
uh like power differential because you
know especially with the president but
apparently
this other husband that she was sleeping
with wasn't the president
so it wasn't just that
monica appears to not be too concerned
about breaking up marriages
i think we have to reassess
what we think of monica lewinsky you
know is she by the way i like her
i like monica lewinsky i you know follow
her on twitter and stuff i think she's a
wonderful personality
and i do think that you know she was
young and she got herself in some bad
situation but
i don't think you can give her a pass
for breaking up two marriages
or you know ruining them essentially
because they're never the same after
that
um
i don't know i i feel like we should
judge her more harshly
and not see her as the victim exactly
she's a little bit of a victim i give
you that
because the power differential that's
real
but
she's she was also an adult
she was also an adult
she had a little bit of responsibility
there and i don't think she did it
all right
some cool housing
options are coming online i think you're
going to see a whole bunch more of this
i've mentioned these before but they're
they're growing so it's more of a thing
so in denver there are 455 units of
co-living space
so basically they're taking the college
dorm model
and just improving it you know so it's
not as basic as a college dorm but it
gives you the advantages of the social
life you know you're surrounded by
people in similar situations and you
might have a roommate but you've got
common facilities where you'll meet each
other etc
i feel like
housing needs to solve two problems not
one
and housing
historically housing has solved one
problem
housing
right the only problem that housing ever
solved
was you got a place to live
but there's a second problem and i want
to see in the comments some confirmation
loneliness
the ability to just meet people that you
can you know have a relationship with as
friends
and neighbors
and
i feel as though we need options such
that the housing solves your social life
at the same time
at least gives you social interaction in
a natural way
and solves that at the same time as it
solves housing there's no reason it
couldn't
in fact it should
i would argue it's the biggest problem
now
when people were universally
or seemingly universally getting married
and having families
much less important
because your family is that you know
that social thing and then the kids have
friends and then the parents of the kids
become your friends and everything so if
you have a family you're already in good
shape
probably because you meet people just
automatically having a family
but for the single people of which there
are more and more of them
they're gonna need something that isn't
tinder
because tinder doesn't work except for
the top two percent of guys
all the other guys don't have a chance
but if they're meeting people in a
natural setting well they have a chance
too
so
uh this is a big deal
that i think will just get bigger and
bigger
and then there's an intergenerational
housing option in which i think the deal
is that they find like a senior citizen
who might need a little help
and they pair them with a
young person say a college student
who just needs a cheap place to stay
it's actually a good combination
you know making sure that the old person
has you know somebody there to call
9-1-1 or you know lift heavy objects
and the young person gets a nice house
to live in that would be better than
they can afford it's pretty good
we'll see more of that too
well there's another woman's soccer
coach fired for
sexual misbehavior allegedly
let me ask you this
you've got a
woman's
team let's say it's gymnastics let's say
it's volleyball
let's say it's women's soccer
what kind of people are going to be on
those teams
young females who are in unusually good
physical shape
do you think you should ever have a male
coach or a male doctor in that situation
i mean
i'm not the taliban right
and i don't think you know you should
necessarily limit people's employment by
their gender
that's a problem
um yeah well some of them are lesbians
but i don't think that
is that's not the biggest variable here
here's my question
you don't want to be the taliban
but why the hell do you think it's a
good idea to put a normal heterosexual
male
in a situation where all day long he
deals with
attractive young women
there's no way in the world this doesn't
get you in trouble
but again you know you don't want to be
the taliban and say oh we can't have the
genders
mixing or anything but this is crazy
it's crazy to have men in these
positions am i wrong
maybe maybe there's a legal reason where
you just have to do it because you can't
discriminate or something and i realize
that you know women are coaching male to
use now but that's different right
isn't that different
because you don't have the the power
imbalance problem
i say yes you're wrong a little wrong
i would acknowledge i'm a little wrong
because there's no
clean right answer right you don't want
to limit people's employment by gender
that's true
but you don't want to create a situation
where you're guaranteeing sexual
harassment
i mean you talk about guaranteeing it
really
all right
well
i'd look into that
uh here's a feel-good story there were
some burglars who broke into a home in
koita county in georgia
and uh the owner's dogs uh killed him
killed the burglar they was found dead
on the porch
i i have no comment on it it was just a
sort of a feel-good story
i love dogs
well dr anarchy over on twitter that's
not his real name but dr anarchy who
does not wish you to know his real
identity
reports that the icu at his hospital in
florida is 100 capacity they have no
beds
left
is that a big problem or a small problem
well let me give you some context before
you say it in the comments
i know i know i'm going to give you the
context don't worry
the context is this all icus try to
operate in your capacity
all icus
try to operate pretty close to capacity
because they make money on the icus
so they're always
90 full
so all you need is any kind of a you
know mass casualty event and that extra
10 gets filled
so covet
should be expected
given all the different hospitals in the
country and the fact that statistics are
not
smooth you know they're they're lumps of
everything in statistics there are
statistical clusters
so you are guaranteed
that even if covid isn't crashing
hospitals in general
you're guaranteed there will be specific
hospitals that do
reach capacity
is that a problem
well
in this particular hospital the
additional context is that only 10
percent of the icu
has coveted patients
so 90 of the icu is just the regular
patients they only had 10 capacity you
know roughly
10 percent extra anyway because that's
what they always have
and this particular hospital filled it
up
does that mean they can't have another
icu person
nope
they just expand it
they just add beds
so no they they are not turning anybody
away
because they know how to expand and
contract that capacity but their
official icu capacity is at capacity
official icu resources are at capacity
but doesn't mean as much as you think
so probably it's not the problem that it
sounds like when you first hear it but
it's
you know we should know about it
um
in other uh
interesting celebrity news do you know
senk uh is it uh auger iger i don't know
how exactly to pronounce his last name
but you probably know senk he's got a
show the young turks
uh he's uh
he identifies with the left
and he i guess he went after joe rogan
on the vaccination question
and somebody dared him to say this to
joe rogan's face
uh and then that turned into
senk
saying in public at least on twitter
senk believes that he could beat joe
rogan in a fight if it came to that
now
take a look at senk
oyger iger
and i apologize if i'm pronouncing his
name right i never do that intentional
by the way i would never intentionally
disrespect somebody by pronouncing their
name wrong
but there it is i probably did
and
is there anybody here who thinks that
senk could beat joe rogan in a fight
senk says he's a big guy and he's been
fighting since you know he's been
fighting all his life so he knows how to
fight
he's not exactly
trained in the martial arts as far as we
know
so
first of all joe rogan would never fight
him i don't think there's any chance
that would happen
but yeah joe rogers like highly trained
and ripped
he could lift a school bus
and
and he could tear a person apart with
you know one hand
but thinks he has a chance now it would
be easy to to dunk on sync for this
opinion that seems crazy to the rest of
us but i'm not going to do that
i'm going to here i'm going to give you
like a surprise twist
i actually like the fact
that senk said in public you think she
could take joe rogan
the reason i like not because it's true
i mean i think it's silly you know and
just ridiculous
but i love the fact they said it
because you know if if trump had said
something like this and brought a lot of
attention to himself i would have been
praising him
because part of his job was bringing
attention right and if it worked hey it
worked
senk's job is like that too part of his
job is marketing his own product and if
he got us all to look at this and nobody
got punched
home run
home run so i'm going to get a second
a-plus
for marketing
i don't know how well he fights
but he's a marketing mofo
this is really good so good job senk
nice marketing
but uh don't take a punch
don't throw a punch at joe biden
or i'm sorry joe rogan
don't punch joe biden either but don't
don't punch joe rogan i don't think
that'll work out for you
alex jones lost a big
legal case it looks like so the sandy
hook thing you all know he
he believed the sandy hook school
shooting at one point he made a claim
that maybe they were actors or something
and that it didn't really happen well he
got sued and
apparently it's gonna cost him a lot of
money if this stands
and he was found legally responsible in
two lawsuits for damages
caused by his claims to which i ask
what exactly were the damages
was it that the
uh the parents and the survivors got a
lot of grief from other people was that
what it is was that the damages
or was it emotional damage
i have mixed feelings about this
on one hand people do need legal
recourse when people say crazy things
that affect them in public
you probably need some kind of legal
you know
option there
but this feels like a violation of free
speech
if we accept that
alex jones was wrong
wasn't it also an opinion
he's not exactly a news
source is he isn't he an opinion person
and if it was his opinion looking at the
facts
that this looked like a hoax but he was
terribly terribly wrong
do you get sued for being wrong
like how do you lose a case just because
you were wrong
and by the way he's invented he's wrong
later he admitted
so if you've even admitted you were
wrong
how do you lose that case i don't know
if i want to live in this country where
you could lose on an opinion because
somebody was injured by your opinion
that's like a standard i don't know if
we want to keep
so
this is a big old red flag on uh freedom
of speech i'd say
well if you haven't seen the video going
around today of rand paul
uh talking to hhs head xavier
basara
or is the c hard
is it a hard scene bakara or is it it's
basara
somebody tell me the pronunciation of
that bakara
anybody anybody all right somebody will
tell me basara i'm hearing
seems right i'm going to go with the
basara
um
so rand paul was talking to him about
apparently health and human services
is part of the government that says
you need a vaccination as opposed to
proving that you have antibodies because
you got infected already
now as you know rand paul has had covet
and he says his antibodies are better
than people who are vaccinated and
apparently there's a large study he
referenced that would agree
and
you have to watch
rand paul dissect this guy on live tv
it is
one of the best
you know live performances i can call it
that
that you'll ever see
now here's what makes it brutal not only
is rand paul you know he has medical
credentials right but
the guy he's talking to doesn't i guess
he's a lawyer or something by training
so first of all rand paul is
uh he's not
listen here's the best way to say it
rand paul seemed to have taken his
presentation instead of raising his
energy to like really press his point
and like you you know and get mad at
this guy he went the other way
that you can only do
if your argument is so damn good
that you don't even need to alter your
presentation to help it
and that and that is so strong
persuasion wise
if your case is this strong and you
lower your energy
it's devastating
so watch rand paul
lower his energy
and just
dissect this mother you know this guy
he dissects him
it is fun to watch
you really have to watch it
um
and so let me let me say it again i'll
give you maybe uh i'll act today
had he said something like are you a
medical doctor are you a medical doctor
are you
and you watch that you would say to
yourself all right it's just two people
fighting on tv i've seen a million of
this
but instead
rand paul is
he's lowered his energy way down
but because he's the only one talking
you know he's televised he gets all the
attention
and the lower he goes
the more powerful it is
so you just see him sitting there saying
and do you have a medical degree are you
a doctor
no you're not a doctor
do you have a science degree
well not a science degree are you aware
of the study
that says that natural immunity is seven
times better
than
the vaccination
or you've not seen that study i think
you should actually refer to that study
two two and a half million people were
studied
you know and i'm not i don't think i'm
doing a good enough
job of it but you have to watch rand
paul pull this off it is masterful and
it is freaking great
so
in terms of public communication a
double plus
for rand paul
uh there's a historian stephanie
grisham's book
uh that uh trump was asked about going
uh i don't know vegan or vegetarian or
something and allegedly trump's
swift response was and he was very
serious about it he said no no it messes
with your body chemistry your brain and
if i leave if i lose even one brain cell
we're
aft
if i lose even one brain cell we're f'ed
first of all i love that part of it
i love the fact that trump is completely
aware that as president of the united
states and the person with the nuclear
codes that if he loses even one brain
cell the whole world is left
true
right and now we have joe biden so maybe
we're left
but do you believe the statement it
messes with your body chemistry your
brain
what do you think
scientifically accurate
or not
now many of you know that i'm
i was vegetarian for years now i'm a
pescetarian
um
let me tell you my experience when i
went vegetarian
you ready
changed my
changed my thinking and my mood and
my body chemistry
and i could tell
now how did it change it
i became less aggressive
now is it cause and effect i don't know
but it happened at the same time
i felt that
eating meat
made me more aggressive
and in my specific case
i have a problem with being too
aggressive not a problem with not being
aggressive enough
i spent a lot of time
trying to
control my own aggressiveness
i think you could tell from my like
facial structure i'm sensitive to
testosterone
it doesn't mean i have a lot it just
means that it has a bigger effect on my
body that's the
the male pattern baldness here the
square chin
testosterone sensitivity so i feel like
i just have a natural aggressiveness
that being a vegetarian
took the edge off that's what it felt
like
i may know i'm not making a medical
claim i'm not saying you would have this
experience i'm not even saying the
science would agree with me but i will
tell you that that's what i experienced
so i don't know if he's right or wrong
but uh
it doesn't shock me to hear you have
that opinion
big news coming uh i'm going to talk a
little bit about uh
covet stuff but it's new stuff i think
you might like it even if you're i won't
try to sell you on vaccinations okay
don't don't worry about that i'm not
going to try to sell you on anything i'm
just going to tell you what's new
so uh merck
is coming out with some antiviral pills
that apparently reduce the risk
of death from covered by 50 percent
and they'll be ready maybe this year and
apparel i think there are two other big
companies that have some antivirals
coming
we're still waiting on information on
their effectiveness but here's my
question to you
how many of these various
meds can you take at the same time
suppose there are three antivirals that
come out
can you take them all
do they work in if they worked in
different ways why can't you take them
all
can you take them at the same time as
your monoclonal antibodies
same time as your prednisone your
vitamin d
how many how many of these things that
we already give to people can you take
it at the same time here's why i'm
asking
if the antiviral did i said
and reduced your risk of
hospitalization you have to take it
early first five days of symptoms but if
you take it early it reduces your risk a
lot
and so do these other things
so we started with a risk that was small
to begin with
but you know it doesn't matter how small
it is if you multiply by 370 million
people is still too big
but we took that risk that was already
small and then we cut it in half
with let's say prednisone
and then we cut it in half again with
vitamin d
and we cut it in half again with
monoclonal antibodies
and then we cut it in half again with
antivirals
am i doing the math right
if you yeah aren't we done
i mean when the antivirals come online
it could be the end of the year aren't
we done
because how many times can you take a
small risk and cut it in half before
you're done
i realize there's a zenos paradox
happening here and you can never you
know you can never get to zero if you're
only cutting into half every time but
yeah yes i beat you to it
i knew that zeno's paradox was coming i
beat you to the comments only because
there's a delay on youtube
um
yeah it depends on how many overlapping
mechanisms right
exactly
if the antivirals use the same mechanism
can they all be patented
here's a question for you can you patent
drugs that are developed at the same
time that use the same mechanism to do
their work
if if one was not copying the other they
just came out about the same time
does the first one get the pattern and
the rest of them can't can't mark it
how does that work
i have questions
but i feel like
we're going to be uh
through with this oh we have some news
that a senior al-qaeda leader was killed
by an
american drone strike in syria
do you believe that a senior al-qaeda
leader was killed in a drone strike no
civilians were killed
who believes that that really happened
not me
[Laughter]
not me now it's not impossible that it
happened
but
let's
let's just look at the timing shall we
because
correct me if i'm wrong didn't the
american military need a pallet cleanser
with the drone strikes because you know
they want to do more drone strikes
obviously it's a good weapon but they've
got that bad one
on their permanent record you know the
civilians they killed by accident
they needed a clean drone strike really
soon didn't they
so that you would start thinking good
about drones again you know you'd
have your average of good ones to bad
ones would be better
what are the chances
that an unfor unverifiable
attack on a
leader an al-qaeda leader would happen
just about now
i'm sorry
this timing
no
i feel as if this al-qaeda leader
might have been not so much of a leader
as
maybe somebody
in the group
and uh maybe there were people who got
killed that weren't just al-qaeda
i'm not going to believe anything about
this story
doesn't mean it's untrue
i'm not telling you it's fake
i'm saying that credibility is different
than true or false i say this a lot but
i have to keep saying it when you say
something's not credible
doesn't mean it's false it just means
that the source can't be believed
so this is coming
a credible source for drone strike
information we know that
right and we know that
uh yeah two on the nose exactly i'm
seeing that comment two on the nose a
little little too perfect
yeah
um
so
uh
california
there's a mask mandate question and
there was some
article about trying to figure out who
it is who actually has the power to give
mass mandates in california i guess it's
a little murky
like who what what part of the
government can even tell you to do that
but i'm not too interested in that part
of the story i'm interested in this part
of the story
i keep seeing online
that the american public believes that
the government
has control over how long you wear masks
that's crazy
everybody who's worried about the
government
permanently keeping you in masks
what
here's why that's crazy
the government doesn't have any power
over you wearing a mask
you wear masks because most of the
public still wants to
as soon as the percentage of the public
changes to you know some other
percentage
it'll stop
the government has no power none
none
you know they have power over
individuals
but they don't have power over the
public
none
no not not for masks i mean if you could
imagine if they used the military to get
something done they could do that but
they're not gonna they're not gonna
deploy the military
to make you wear a mask
because the public will take the masks
off when the science says they can
right
and that probably will be around year
end when we have enough therapeutics and
the vaccination
uptake is looking good and the numbers
are coming down
the american public will decide
now if the government is smart they'll
front run the public that that that the
government will on its own get rid of
the mask mandate before the public
tells them they have to
but the moment you think that the
government has control over this
decision you are very confused
the government has no control
australia nope australia is not an
example
of the government having control it's
not
it just means that the public is not
agreeing with getting rid of the mandate
at a high enough percentage
as soon as enough of the public
is done with the masks in australia
they're done that's it
there's no exception to this
right
not for masks i mean there would be an
exception if it was you know some bigger
issue that
went to homeland security or something
then the government might have to do
what it has to do
but not with masks
right the public has this decision
completely don't be fooled if you want
if you want to change it change change
the opinion of the people around you
change other public opinion you don't
even need to talk to the government the
government will do what we tell them to
do we just have to decide what that is
the reason we haven't told them to drop
the mask mandate is the public the
public doesn't want it by enough of a
percentage
as soon as we do
it's done
and the public isn't going to wear a
freaking mask forever there's no way
no way that's going to happen
all right so don't worry about that
you can worry about how long it takes
that's going to be a pain in the ass but
i wouldn't worry about it being forever
here's a similar this is an analogy i
just thought of it when i was looking at
this story
when i was a budget guy working at a big
bank it was my job to
collect the budget requirements and then
you know report them etc and the
department heads would come to me and
they say i'd need more budget
and i'd say them well don't ask me
i'm not in charge of your what your
budget is i'm just reporting it i'm the
guy who just
gives information i don't make decisions
and they couldn't understand that and i
would tell them you know you're the one
in charge of your budget right
that the all it takes to get more money
is to go to your boss and make a case
that if you had this money the business
would be better off
and i would tell the department heads
stop acting like i have the power over
your budget i don't have any
and stop acting like your boss
has power over your budget that's an
illusion
it's an illusion
it wasn't in this case because we had
plenty of capital if you were actually
constrained for capital then your boss
would have that decision but we weren't
constrained for capital we were
constrained for good ideas that was the
constraint so i said that you can have
all the money you want you just have to
tell your boss that you'll make more
money
than you spend
make the case or that something will be
better security or something
so lots of times we have this illusion
of who's in power
and that illusion can really limit you
and also mess with your head
you have the power quite long
you have the power over how people feel
about you
when you walk into a room
you change how people feel
that's true of everybody right when a
new person enters changes the chemistry
of the room you change other people
and if you learn to do it right
you'll feel that you always have the
power
when
um i'm in a situation with let's say
dangerous men
right who might have some reason to kill
me
i never feel afraid because i always
feel like i have complete power over the
situation
meaning that i can talk a man of killing
me i can run away and get a gun and come
back i mean i just have all the power i
want
so sometimes you get caught in the
in the uh illusion
that people have power over you here's
another one
suppose you are threatened
by somebody that you know
threatened like physically threatened by
somebody you know here's my first
thought
i know where that person lives
that's the end of the threat
isn't it
if you know where somebody lives
they better not touch you
because i'm going to be visiting them in
the middle of the night and it's not
going to go well
right you have the full power to kill
anybody you want i don't recommend it by
the way but you can kill
anybody if you know where they live
that's all you need
right
so um again it's not a good idea i'm
just telling you that
you often underestimate your own power
and it's a big problem
you have power over masks collectively
you have power over almost all of your
situations you just don't realize it or
maybe you don't know how to use it
so don't give away your power is what
i'm saying
and that ladies and gentlemen
is coffee with scott adams
one of the best experiences you'll ever
have
um
you know where i have
that's right you have power over me
because you know where i live
sort of
um
apparently there's a story about a woman
who uh
who was survived the 1918 pandemic the
spanish flu
and then just died at 100 and whatever
uh from covid so she survived the
spanish flu but died of comet
i'm not sure that's the way i would have
coded that i would have called that a
spanish flu death
but that's just me
i'm just kidding
um
all right
uh or did you die of being 102 yeah i
guess she died of being 102.
all right that's all for now um goodbye
youtube
i'll talk to you tomorrow
