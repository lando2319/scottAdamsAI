good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
yep it's cold coffee with scott adams
and it's gonna be lit today
off the hook
it'll be
provocative
entertaining
possibly change your life
all of that in the period of just
minutes it's amazing really do you think
we could do even better than that i do i
do and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass a tanker chalice or stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind filling with your favorite liquid
and
i know you like coffee some of you
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including the pandemic it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now ago
yeah powering up
it's like a battery that just got fully
charged wow
it's amazing
well while i was waiting to go live here
today i was getting catfished
got some messages from a
nice woman named um
christina basham christina basham
and uh
this uh nice woman named christina
basham who doesn't seem to know who i am
is interested in maybe a relationship
uh i look at her picture and she's very
beautiful
very beautiful
and so
i texted back and i said uh
you think i will believe you were my
wife
and the catfisher said yes baby i missed
you
this is not your best catfisher
and i said
i am standing next to my wife right now
catfisher says
you are married
oh no
and i said i'm married to christina
basham who is with me now
cat fisher says
oh lol
[Laughter]
lol
that's right my last message was
nice try where are you based nigeria
i'm actually curious
i want to find out
where the where this catfisher is based
and you know and since i got a an olol
you know obviously he knows whoever it
is knows that uh i know it's a it's a
scam i wonder if he'll just tell me
say oh yeah i'm over here in
detroit or
someplace
but anyway um if you didn't know it my
wife's
photo from social media is widely used
on
on
social media by catfishers cat fishers
yeah
uh and you know about once every two
weeks ago or so we get these
disturbed messages from people who say
but i've been sending you money for
years
no you've been sending money to a
photograph
with somebody else well here's the story
of the day do you know entertainer cher
she was walking out of a movie theater
and saw this beautiful young couple and
asked if she could take their picture
just because they were such a
good looking young couple so she takes
her picture
posted on
social media and
became a big viral sensation
and here's what she tweeted
she said when we were coming out of a
movie i saw a beautiful couple
he was taking her picture she had
flowers i said can i take your picture
i had my mask on so they didn't know who
i was
maybe just a crazy woman that be
um
it could be
it could be that they didn't recognize
her
this 20-something beautiful young couple
it could be they didn't recognize cher
because she had her mask on
that's one of the possibilities
the other possibility
is that they're a young couple who have
never heard of cher
[Laughter]
how many people in their 20s even would
recognize cher
right
am i right
and you know i i feel i can speak to
this phenomenon
because there aren't too many people you
know in high school who could name
dilbert as a comic strip either
but
i like her little blind spot that the
reason they didn't recognize her is
because she had a mask on i'm going to
start using that
you've never heard of the dilbert comic
strip youngster
is it because i'm wearing a mask
i think it'll work
well cnn is all at twitter all at
twitter not on twitter
but they're all a twitter their hearts
are fluttering
because there's some news that is
oh it's just like candy for their hearts
uh and it is that uh the lawsuit
brought by dominion the voting election
voting company
they're bringing a lawsuit alleging that
fox news personalities including tucker
carlson janine
pereiro
sean hannity and their on-air guests
spread lies about fraud in the 2020
election the hurt dominion's business
it's one of several lawsuits
that they're doing against right-wing or
right right-leaning entities i guess
now um
there are two essential claims one is
that the opinion people
uh brought brought experts on and and
talked in a way that suggested there was
a problem and hurt their business
the other is that the news people or at
least producers or you know
people in the decision-making uh
chain
were probably aware of information they
did not report
that would have been more complementary
to dominion
so two claims one is that the opinion
people
said things that they feel are untrue
and number two that there may have been
extra information that fox news
collectively or individually
was aware of
that would have been important to give
you context to the story that was left
out
so does anyone anybody want to make a
prediction how this lawsuit goes
i'm feeling i'm feeling pretty confident
about this prediction i mean
the total amount i know about the law
could be put in a
thimble within a thimble
but i feel like i could get this one
no i don't know that it'll be dismissed
or thrown out
but we have seen that
the rachel maddow defense
is that it's just an opinion
and it worked right
the defense that opinion people giving
opinions
can't be wrong in a libelous way has
already passed
muster
beyond that
facebook's lawsuit
they're claiming that even their fact
checkers are opinions
so not only are opinions opinions but
fact checkers
are just opinions
so in that world where those two things
seem to be
somewhat established ish
is there any way that opinion people
are gonna
you know somehow be found guilty now
um
i don't know what the standard is for
this this is a
civil suit
right
so that means they don't need a
full majority do they
they just need to or the standard is
lower than a criminal case let's just
put it that way
so i suppose anything can happen but i
would say the precedent has largely been
set that opinions are opinions and facts
or opinions
now what if it's true
suppose uh they can come up with a an
email or set of emails just
hypothetically
that would suggest that fox news was
aware
of more information than they reported
and that information could have been
good for dominion's
side of things
do you think that the courts will set a
standard
as a precedent
that if you leave out some relevant
facts to your reporting
you can be sued
just think about it
that's all of the news
the entire news landscape is is the left
leaving out stuff you know that would be
good for the right and the right leaving
out stuff that would be good for left
there's nothing but that
if you create that standard it will
destroy the entire news industry there
wouldn't be anything left
yeah how would the fine people hoax play
do you think that if trump sued cnn
for the fine people hoax you wouldn't
find any internal communication
saying that they knew that they'd
clipped off part of the the video to
turn it into a hoax you don't think
anybody knew that
yeah they did
yeah you might even find a you might
even find a digital communication from
me
to somebody at cnn
telling them that very thing
[Laughter]
so
uh i don't think they can win on that
right i mean i don't know how precedent
works exactly in this domain but i don't
see how you could possibly have a
standard that if you left something out
you're guilty
you know just for that even if you knew
it even if you totally knew you were
doing it and why you did it
i would just it would destroy the entire
news industry there would be nothing
left
which would be funny
all right
now here's the other uh scary thing
about it apparently
there is some point in this process in
which dominion would get access to fox
news's
communications
like private communications
which i assume would include from
outside people
now aside people who are communicating
with fox news hosts
which includes me
my private communications
just got released
i think
i think
because i do have a history that i have
communicated with
more than one fox host by
by digital means
so my private communications are now in
play
let me give you some advice
do any of you use encrypted apps
so you can stay out of trouble
how many of you use some kind of an
encrypted app
for communicating
stop it
stop it
don't do it
if you're using an encrypted app because
you think it's safe oh my god you're a
sucker
you are a sucker
they are the least safe thing you could
ever do do you know why
because that's where all the good stuff
is
where are you going to look for where
are you going to look for stuff
there
here are the ways your encrypted
communications can be corrupted number
one
the government always had a back door
how would you know
company tells you they don't government
says no we don't do that
but that's what they would say
right how do you know the government
doesn't have a back door
why wouldn't they
if they could
why wouldn't they
it's crazy not to it would almost be
um an abdication of responsibility
if they didn't have back doors to all
the encrypted apps now i don't know that
they do
i'm just saying i'd be deeply surprised
if they or some other a foreign entity
doesn't have access to at least one of
them
at least one of them
now i'm not worried about the encryption
being broken at the moment that's
probably your smallest risk
the next risk is that the message you
send can be captured on your device
before it gets encrypted
because anything that you're typing
could be captured by
a virus
am i right
a hacker could install something on your
phone or device
it would capture your message before it
even got to the encrypted part
right
a key logger yeah and i imagine they
could take a screenshot or something
you know you would have those options
how about when it reaches the
destination
and then it's on the destination phone
and it's on the screen
could a a hacker get it if it's if it's
on the screen
i assume so it's just a screenshot
how hard would that be
so
it's definitely hackable
and it's definitely corruptable by some
government entity and they would lie to
you because that's their job in this in
this instance it would be their job to
lie to you so if they're doing their job
you wouldn't know
but here's the biggest part
anything you send to somebody
they can show to somebody else
that's it
anything that you show to another human
that human can just show it to somebody
else
right
and no matter how much trust you put in
the encryption you're just looking in
the wrong place
it's not the encryption you have to
worry about it's all the people
so
um
never send a message over digital means
that you would
um
be in serious trouble if it were outed
just don't ever do it
no matter how private you think it is
just don't ever do it ever not once i
wouldn't do it under any condition ever
once
and it doesn't matter if you're running
for office or not
because you see in these cases you could
be a completely
you know unrelated to any kind of crime
and somebody can open up your messages
you've seen my messages in the news
haven't you
i'll bet you've seen a private message
of mine in the news i have
and i don't know how that happened
anyway
here's some good news on uh
fusion
now of course you have to take all
fusion good news with grain of salt
because you know for 30 years we've had
fusion breakthroughs that never reached
any
conclusion
but apparently the
industry has been chugging along and
they are making incremental
breakthroughs
all the time
you know there it's it seems to be
as sam altman told me a few years ago
it's now an engineering problem where
they just have to figure out how to
iterate quickly
well apparently this big
breakthrough
uh and i don't know the science behind
this i'll just read this so for the
first time a fusion
reaction has achieved a record blah blah
you know energy output
exceeding the energy absorbed
oh sorry
come on
so
so they're saying that they've you know
achieved some fusion breakthrough but i
think what they really achieved if you
read the article
if you read the article what they really
achieved is a way to um
view it
or to actually measure it
which apparently was something they
couldn't do before because all these you
know super hot
reactions you know how do you how do you
know what's happening in there so you
can adjust it so they have some kind of
mechanism now that they they can see
what they're doing and they can know if
they're adding more or subtracting more
and apparently that uh just opens up a
big
you know a highway toward getting it
done
so i think this is further evidence that
it's an engineering problem
we're down to iteration
and testing
and that's it
it's just it's just innovation and
testing
why are you saying something about
cernovich is there some cernovich news
today
that i don't know about
anyway this breakthrough was uh just
down the road from where i am right now
at lawrence livermore lab
practically walking distance someplace
i've i've been
i've
i've given a speech at lawrence
livermore lab it feels it feels kind of
real to me because it's it's literally
you know i know people work there it's
just like right down there
and they've
just right down the road
have created
maybe the most important technology of
all time
all right
i heard from a
german high school teacher today
connor widmeyer
connor might be watching today so hi
connor
and he tweeted this he said i taught the
user interface for reality this is a
micro lesson that i did on locals i
can't remember if i did it publicly too
but
i talked about how to use different uh
filters or frames
to view reality and how to potentially
interact with reality
and connor says he taught that lesson to
his german high school today
and
and he quoted part of it he said first
you must accept that the frame at least
as a filter meaning you don't have to
accept it as truth
just
accept it as a way to predict the world
uh and then he said he gave examples
about religion and they were blown away
now the thing that blows me away
is that something i was doing here is
being taught in high school in germany
in one class
but
it turns out that
a lot of things that i do get taught in
in
schools
so a lot of the dilbert material has
been packaged up to teach in business
schools
so there are lots of business school
classes that i think there are some
some psychology related classes they use
dilbert as a lot of examples
so dilbert is used in schools and then
you know the systems versus
goals the the talent stacking
and now the user interface for reality
i know my book god's debris
is assigned often in college courses so
weirdly i have all these connections to
education
that i wasn't expecting
so the salvation army is uh
took a real big hit on their donations
uh because they had some kind of a guide
they put out
within the salvation army that said that
white culture
has challenges and needs to overcome
among other things this was just
something that was within it
uh including they have to get over their
denial of racism
and their defensiveness about race
it states that white americans need to
quote stop trying to be colorblind
so how did that work out for the
donations to the salvation army
yeah down by about a third
so who was it who said everything woke
turns to was that trump
is trump the first one who said that
it's sort of a
it was trump right everything woke turns
to
there will never be a more accurate
predictive
rule
i mean i thought i was good at
predicting but you can't beat this
everything woke turns to
[Laughter]
you just see it over and over and over
again
every time you see it it's just
destroying something our schools or
our government
so um
here's what uh
here's what i think must be done
well i won't say must but could be done
i've told you about malicious compliance
right
the idea that you can destroy something
by embracing it
and acting like it's real and
important if you think it's not
how would you do that in the case of uh
this wokeness and uh
and the
the the idea that we should
stop denying racism and stop being
defensiveness about race and
and that white people need to stop being
colorblind suppose we embraced that
but
even embraced it more than it is stated
i would go so far as to say we should
also put out guides about ugly people
short people old people and especially
white people who also are discriminated
against i believe that we should
increase our list until everybody who is
being discriminated for any reason
is uh included now if those reasons are
things they can't change such as being
unattractive uh ugly old or white
and so i think the best way to deal with
the fact that
wokeness turns everything to is to
embrace it harder than it exists
and say wait a way why are you stopping
this with
people of color
that's a big problem
but it's only one of them why would you
stop there why would you allow the world
to be so unwoke when there were easy
ways to wake it up even more why would
you stop at half woke
i don't want your half woke
give me full woke
full woke or nothing
so i would call this a half woke attempt
i've told you before that the solution
to all the wokeness is
do you know what the solution is
to embrace it fully
so that if somebody says hey i think
something's happening because i'm black
instead of saying no that's not
happening there's no racism that's a
dumb approach
right it might be true in that in a
specific situation it might be more true
than false but it's a dumb dumb approach
that doesn't work
you want to you want to embrace it and
take it further and say absolutely you
were being discriminated in so many ways
because it's true
you know systemic racism totally true
if you're arguing that it doesn't exist
that's just a bad argument it certainly
exists in the sense of the
teachers unions
uh that's the worst systemic racism as
long as that's an obvious example i
don't think you can say it doesn't exist
and surely it exists in other ways
throughout society in all the ways that
they that they describe but you know
what else exists
all the other stuff
all the other stuff really exists
it's true that short people don't get
promoted as much
it's true that if you have a you know
any kind of a difference you're ugly
you're overweight you're whatever
you're going to be discriminated against
so let's uh let's get all that in there
and i think that the best way we should
deal with each other
is to acknowledge
instead of ignoring the color or
ignoring the difference we should just
go right at it
just go right at it
we should be able to have like a
conversation like every minute i wonder
if that happened because you're black
you should be able to bring that up
anytime without any any kind of
provocative pushback it should be a
legitimate question
i wonder if that happened because you're
short
also legitimate i wonder if that would
have been the same outcome if you were
more attractive
also totally legitimate why not just put
it all out there
put it all out there and say yep
i lost two careers for being white and
male some of you don't believe that but
there's a whole back story there in my
corporate days i was told that directly
by the way that's that's not me reading
between the lines
my bosses told me directly they couldn't
promote me because i was white and male
now that's just true
so that puts me on the side of you know
black americans who have been
discriminated in employment
why can't i be on their side
if i had the same experience
in one of the most important elements of
society which is economics
so
embrace it until there's nothing left
and then we'll all be better off i think
well
there's another
blockbuster report coming out of the
january 6
hearings congressional hearings
you may not have heard this so this this
will be breaking news to all of you
um
someone took a lunch
out of the refrigerator in the
congressional break room and that lunch
was labeled
with the name of the person who is
planning to eat it but someone unnamed
we don't know
took that lunch from the congressional
break room and therefore
president trump is guilty of
insurrection
if you haven't been following the story
you know that the blockbusters don't
have to have any connection to the point
could be just some emails somebody found
could be somebody just testified
they don't have to have any connection
to the insurrection but everything that
they come up with
we have learned from cnn is connected to
proof
that trump is an insurrectionist so
until that missing lunch is uh
found i'm gonna have to say he's an
insurrectionist because logic logic
um
you all know about the elf on the shelf
if you're
coming to us from a non-american country
i don't know if you have that tradition
where a little elf doll is put on the
shelf during christmas
well in breaking news the elf on the
shelf uh got a roommate
uh it's biden's legislative agenda
rasmussen has a poll
uh says the house of representatives uh
people asked what they thought of their
uh how well they're doing their job and
the public
30 of them said that's either excellent
or good the house of representatives
that feels high doesn't it
doesn't that seem high
um
and then uh in the senate uh 21 of them
were
were rated 21 percent of the public said
that the senate was excellent or good
that also seems high because isn't the
approval of congress in general like in
the teens
so this is the weird way that people
answer poll questions
if you ask them to approve of congress
in general
it'd be like 18
but if you say you know how are they
doing
30 said excellent or good
so
i don't know which number is closer to
reality here
um
and then rasmussen asked
about buildback better do people support
it or oppose it
38 support it
that's actually more than i thought
does that sound high
um a 38
support it
i'm not sure if rasmussen is going to
ask how many people know what's in it
how many people do you think know what's
in it
well that didn't take long for a meme
um
i don't know what's in it do you
um i know individual things that are in
it
and i i sort of recall i've read a
number of articles where things are
mentioned
but i don't have a comprehensive sense
if you said write down all of the main
items in it you know just a high level
i don't think i could do that could you
so i mean we just hear about individual
stuff
hey jonathan that that's a real good
comment uh jonathan giglio wants to
share this with the rest of you that
clown scott is a clown
good one i'm glad you uh spent your
energy on that because you know um all
the other problems in the world are
are solved
but the thing we didn't know about is if
clown scott was a clown
so
thanks for doing that instead of
exercising or
teaching your kids something valuable
we're all we're all the better for it
i appreciate that
all right
17 said they weren't sure if if they
could support the buildback better i
would say that 17
usually usually i mock the uncertain
because most of the questions you really
should have an opinion on
but this is one i don't know
17
said i don't know
i feel like that's the right opinion i
don't know
i mean if you just focus on what it
would do to inflation then i guess it
would be easy to have a coherent opinion
which is no that's too much you know
sort of the
joe manchin approach
just it's just too much
that's a reasonable opinion could be
true could be false
but it's reasonable
um
45 percent oppose build back better
yeah i really thought it was more
i would say you a reasonable person
could throw the 17
unsure
into the opposed
because
if somebody said to you we're planning
to spend it two trillion dollars
and uh we don't know if it'll be a good
idea or not what do you say you don't
even know what it's about
you spend 2 trillion we don't really
know
i mean some people say yes some people
say it'd be good some say bad well if
you don't know
good decision making usually is biased
or don't do it right
you don't put two trillion dollars into
something you're just guessing about
um so the the unsures i think they're
slightly opposed dish
especially if they don't feel well
informed
anyway uh jay and jay
do me a fact check on this didn't j
who said they're not recommending the j
j shot anymore because of side effects
that's true right oh the fda yeah so the
fda said they're not recommending the j
and j shots so they would recommend the
pfizer and the moderna
first
over the j j
so
what does this tell us that we didn't
know before number one it validates my
strategy
does anybody remember what my
vaccination strategy was
what was my vaccination strategy anybody
wait as long as you can
[Laughter]
wait as long as you can if you can
socially isolate
right i have the advantage that i can
isolate better than most people
so in those in that specific condition
which you know might be unique to me
uh waiting until we know as much as
possible
makes sense
you know you sort of have to game at you
know what is waiting too long and
what is not but i waited i haven't
gotten the booster um at this at the
moment i'm leaning against it but i'll
still wait for more information
but i'm glad i didn't run out and say
give me whatever you got because
remember the fda wasn't the fda saying
it doesn't matter which booster you get
doesn't matter which ones you got you
can get any one of the three
and what did i tell you
i'm still waiting for uh is are there
any doctors on here
if you're a doctor you probably have a
better
view on this i don't i don't have a
confident opinion but i'll tell you my
opinion so this is sort of leaning in
that direction opinion
it goes like this
if you did not have a bad reaction to
whatever vaccination you got
and you don't really have any tests to
tell you the you know what to do next
is it smarter to get a different
vaccination that could have different
level of side effects
or
is it
versus you know getting the same that
you had you had no side effects or
could that
put you over the limit
of how much of that one kind of vaccine
you've got
um
which would you say would be just
commonsensically if you did not have the
benefit of data because we don't
what commonsensically would be safer
doctors only please
if you're a doctor
tell me if you're a doctor in the
comments please
yeah i don't know stick with the devil
you know
uh
oh so your doctor says pfizer is a
smaller dose than moderna but that's
also why it works less right wasn't
modern of the highest
efficacy
uh
uh dr matt wayne says go with what you
had before
dr johnson i'm not sure if you're a real
doctor you're a troll
um
i'm a doctor don't know all right yeah
there's another
dr johnson's all over this one
uh
doctor modern is the best highest amount
of antigen
don't mix and match
all right so
um here's here's another one of those
sort of edge questions
the fda with all their experts said go
ahead and get whichever of the shots you
want
scott said
if you don't have better information
get the one you already had
who had better advice
because because you know the a lot of
the
a lot of the
decisions we're making there's a big
question of you know should you trust
the experts or or trust somebody who's
just good at decision making
because it's different right
i don't know i i feel like i feel like
the edge is for me
because i don't think that we have um
especially if you had the pfizer
if you had the pfizer shot which is a
lower dose than moderna
that's like that's like a slam dunk
isn't it that you would get the pfizer
shot again
but if you had the modernist shot twice
um
now maybe just a little extra pfizer
similar platforms technology
is that better i don't know
i think my my bias would be to stick
with whatever i got but know that if you
stuck with the moderna
your first two doses would be the
highest you know dose of that type
and then by the time you got the booster
you would be you know well into
highest ever of that technology so
that's that's a risk
all right
um
let's talk about pfizer and their 55
years to release data everything you
knew about that was okay let's
start there
what was it even i believed
i think i hope i showed enough
skepticism in this story because i
should have in retrospect
but
do you know why
the 55 years does anybody or it was 75
but it got lowered to 55.
um does any yeah the 75 i think got
lower to 55 it got revised
but does anybody know why
all right well so um
andreas backhouse was tweeting about
this
and
uh even the fda criticized you know the
fda for its you know data sharing
stuff so nobody's happy that it would
take so long but here's my best take on
it
apparently the foyer requests the
requests where i guess any citizen of
standing can request government
information that shouldn't be secret
so there are so many of them now like
even private companies are doing these
all the time for competitive reasons etc
trying to figure out what the
competition is doing there's so many
foia requests that the fda couldn't
possibly do them all
all right so the first thing you need to
know is that the amount of requests is
this big
and the staff for all of those requests
not just for vaccinations but for
everything the fda does for everything
that the staff is like a pinprick
so the the amount of staffing they have
is
nowhere in the neighborhood
of what they would need to get the job
done competently all right so that's the
first thing
second thing is that i guess there's a
lot of stuff that has to be redacted
which means you have to pour over it and
you probably have to show it to three
people to make sure you redacted the
right stuff and i can imagine that if
you've got a gazillion pages of stuff
you'd
you just couldn't even staff up to do
that
there would be no way to staff up enough
because you'd have to have people who
are trained and know what they're
talking about i mean i don't think you
can get there from here
and
so i've got a few comments on this
number one i think what's happening is
malicious compliance
imagine you're the fda
and it is your requirement it's just a
legal requirement that if people ask for
this information
about anything the fda is doing that's
you know non-non-private
um that they have to give it to them
so you imagine you have this incredibly
understaffed
group of people who do these requests
at the fda
totally understaffed what's their
attitude
it's your job to do this impossible
thing
and you've been given
a spec of a budget i mean it's actually
i think it's hundreds of millions of
dollars but compared to how much it
actually would cost it's just a spec
what would you do if that was your job
and you said boss i need 10 times the
budget to even put a dent in this
your boss says nope can't get it to you
you come back next time it's the budget
you still
i need now i need 20 times the budget
because things are just getting worse
and your boss says we don't have the
budget do it you can
you know that's the real situation right
you don't even have to be there to know
that that's true there's something like
that anyway so what does the average
employee whose job it is to do the
impossible their boss has given them no
budget and a job that's literally
impossible what does that employee say
do they say nope i quit
i'm just not even going to do that for
you
no not in any world as the employee said
that not in any world here's what the
employee says absolutely
that'll take based on the budget we have
uh the the resources that you my boss
have allowed me let's see with the
resources you my boss have given me
calculate calculate
75 years
so let's do that i'm all in
your boss says
wait a minute what
yes 75 years with the resources that
you've given me to do this job
uh i'm i'm all on board let's start this
today can i get going why are we talking
i should get going on this you must wait
wait a minute
75 years
that would be like it's worthless it's
not even worth doing
and your employee would say no this is
totally worth doing these are very
valuable requests
and i want to put all the resources i
have that you've given me
into this request very important i think
we need to do this for the public should
take
75 years
can i get going on that
and then what does your boss say
well the boss either has to say oh i
gotta admit it's my fault i couldn't get
you properly funded or does boss just
take that number to his boss and say oh
 it i'm just going to take this boss
to my boss i'll just take this to my
boss they said 75 years
what would it take
to get it done faster
um three billion dollars of extra
funding
on top of the 300 million a year or
whatever it is it's pretty high
and a staff of 15 000
and then we could put a dent in it
never going to happen right
so i think this is a malicious
compliance story about a bureaucratic
situation within the fda has nothing to
do with pfizer
now here's the second question
how much of that information is the
important stuff
suppose you just said all right all
right i see how that could take 75 years
but how about you just give us
all of the the data
results
with you know maybe some underlying data
don't you think they have that in a
packaged form
are you telling me that these randomized
controlled trials
weren't packaged up already
no nobody thought to put all the data in
one place maybe put it on a spreadsheet
of course they did
so how long does it take you to get all
the data that's already packaged up
it shouldn't take too long
now suppose you wanted more than that
and you wanted all the emails about it
well that would just be the emails since
the pandemic started
right
and you would just do a search where for
keywords
do a search and say you know give me
every coronavirus covid or related term
and you just send them over
if you had all of their digital
communication internally and all of
their trial data
how much extra are you going to get from
all the other 74 years
probably not a lot right there's got to
be some kind of 80 20 rule here but i
feel like it's more like a 99 one
like the one percent of the data is
really
99 of what you need
feels like
i don't know i could be wrong about that
very easily very easily could be wrong
about that
but that's what we know about it if you
thought the 75-year thing was some
indication
that pfizer had
knowledge that there were problems with
the data i believe that is thoroughly
debunked at this point
i think it's really an fda problem
scott's grasping at straws
tyrone you're an
goodbye do you know what you could say
could say what i got wrong
you could add context
all right so russia i'm going to talk
about uh dr mccullough on joe rogan
after i do this next segment are you
ready for that
how many of you want to know my full
opinion on dr mccullough
and what he said on joe rogan oh i know
you're going to stay for that but first
let's talk about russia
who has offered a
clean sheet
deal framework with the west
huh
almost as if
russia finds it in their interest to be
our
almost ally
because in my opinion
the arc of history is unmistakably
bending in that direction
meaning that in the long run russia will
be our ally we should just get over it
and make it happen
it's going to happen
because it has to
because you know we're going to need
each other in space basically uh and
with china's rise
so if you know what's going to happen
and i think russia does and i think we
do
uh i find russia's offer
productive
now i don't think we're going to make a
deal based on these terms but let me
read the terms
and then you tell me how far off this is
from something that we might be able to
do
now i think we would have to add
more to it so so this is their offer
it's it's not something that's
you know needs to be evaluated as an
actual deal it's just their first offer
but this is a pretty strong first offer
there is one part of it that's an
instant deal killer but they know that
and i would say that maybe we could work
with it all right here it is
so here's what russia wants
relative to ukraine and the situation
over there they want to rule out further
nato expansion
in general
around their border and ukraine's uh
any any path to it so they don't want
ukraine to be part of nato reasonable or
unreasonable
reasonable or unreasonable
now we would like to treat that as
unreasonable because that would be the
proper negotiating stance nope nope no
way
because if you have to give that up at
some point in any form you want to get
something really big in return right
here's what i would ask for in return
no cyber attacks on each other
now
is that something we could actually get
or determine that we had gotten would we
even know who's attacking us i don't
know
is there is there a
cyber security expert on here who could
tell me
could we ever make a cyber deal
that we could verify was holding
can anybody tell is that even possible i
might
yeah my
my assumption is probably not
but we keep acting like we know when
russia has hacked us right with
hillary's email and such
so part of this you know maybe if we
tried to make a no cyber hacking deal
we probably
couldn't get that deal could we
dr robert johnson says i'm shocked scott
fell for the 75 years excuse
sad such a sheep
well we'll block you today
all right
i feel if we could if there was any way
to make a cyber attack
you know truce
i think you'd have to throw that in
there i would say that blocking nato's
expansion
without that is a non-starter
what do you think
i think any discussion of limiting nato
anywhere
can't go forward as long as
russia is cyber attacking us on the
regular who would agree with
that so the first thing is don't assume
that their list is list you negotiate
from we can add our own stuff
and it could be that we get more benefit
from hacking them than they get from
hacking us so maybe we don't even want
to offer it
it's possible we don't want to offer
that i think you'd have to be pretty
deep into that world to know
if that makes sense
how much do we learn from russia hacks
good question
wrong scott doesn't understand that
russia ought to be our la i'm just
saying russia ought to be our ally what
are you talking about
uh yeah cyber attacks our status quo but
i feel like
we should be at least trying to
negotiate some way out of that i don't
know
um then they're asking uh not to deploy
additional troops
uh
outside any country which they were in
before some date blah blah before any
eastern european countries joined the
alliance blah blah blah so they don't
want you know extra troops that would
threaten them they want to abandon a
nato military activities in the ukraine
so don't do any military
training there
don't put intermediate and short-range
missiles there
not to conduct any exercises with more
than one military brigade
that's in the engine
i'll tell you this one is the one that
signals they're serious
if if russia gave us a list of things
that you just looked at and you said no
this is all crap
then it would mean that they don't
really even mean to have any kind of a
deal but this one this one really
signals some seriousness
not to conduct
exercises with more than one military
brigade the fact that they would allow
that there you know could be military
exercises
but they should be small enough that
they don't look like an attack that
actually feels kind of reasonable
doesn't it
i mean if it were part of the larger
deal not not if it's on his own
um
here's the next one
this is what russia is asking
to confirm that the parties do not
consider each other as adversaries
and agree to resolve all disputes
peacefully and refrain from the use of
force
what would be another way to phrase that
to confirm that parties do not consider
themselves
to confirm that you're not
the opposite
of an ally
let's see if i confirm that i'm not the
opposite of an ally
what am i
this is it
[Laughter]
what do you what have i been telling you
for actually years now i've been telling
you this
russia needs to be an ally with us
it's totally in their best interest
and probably ours too if we couldn't
work out you know all these little cyber
things and
other stuff
i they're saying it directly
um
i feel like that's something you don't
put in a document unless you mean it
because you don't really see people talk
this way do you
when you see companies that are sort of
at each other and they've got a conflict
they don't say directly
why not be friends
that's what putin just said basically
this is as directly as you can state
why don't we just say we'll get along
because we don't really have a reason
not to
right
i've been telling you the whole time we
don't have a reason to be at each other
but we have plenty of reasons to be
allies i mean the the risk
the list of good reason to be allies is
almost infinite
i mean
you would you would die before you
you know finish the list
the list of reasons to be enemies
zero
zero
none
not one not and i don't think russia
sees one i don't think the united states
is one and to me this looks like it
just sort of uh what do you call it
inertia
it's just some kind of leftover inertia
from the cold war or something
anyway i think the russian situation is
going to go the way we want it in the
long run the way they wanted to
apparently china is offering to pay our
social media influencers to say that the
olympics are awesome
and they've hired a public relations
firm in new jersey
to get social media influencers to say
good things about the olympics
in
china at this point us australia and
canada have all
uh they're all going to boycott with
their
diplomatic stuff
the athletes will still participate
and
um
why are we letting
china pay influencers
how would you like to be an influencer
that somebody finds out was paid by
china
what what would happen to
your influence
isn't this a
a death sentence
i i can't think of any influencer who
would have the clout
or the let's say the anti-fragility if
you will
to survive
knowing that china paid them to say good
things about the olympics who could
survive that
i'm so curious if this company that took
their money
the three hundred thousand dollars to
get these influencers i'm so curious if
they can find any now it doesn't take
much money
to influence an influencer because there
are a lot of them who don't have much
money but have big platforms
so maybe yeah maybe you can find
somebody who'll take money for anything
and they might not even if it's young
enough people they might not even know
they're doing anything wrong
you know you get a
you get a 19 year old influencer and you
say i'll give you a
thousand dollars to say some good things
i don't think they're thinking in terms
of
you know international relations i think
they're thinking in terms of twenty
thousand dollars
that's real money
all right so
uh that's disgusting
um
even cnn has an article in which uh or
was it cnn but there is talk among
experts that the omicron might act like
a vaccination so we still have reason to
be worried just because it will be so
spready but listen to this data that i
don't believe will necessarily hold up
but here's some data about omicron
remember it's still fog of war
all these numbers could be wrong
but it's coming from
you know experts
and the experts say that it affects
people about 70 times faster than
earlier strains
what
70 times faster than the thing that just
took out the world
70 times faster than the pandemic itself
what
does that sound right
i mean i don't believe it do you you
know if they said five times i'd be like
well maybe five times but 70 times
if it said 70
faster i'd say oh that's that's a lot
but 70 times do you believe that
if it's 70 times it's going to be over
in a month
right
can somebody do the math but off the off
the top of my head
we're 30 days to total infection if it's
70 times as spready
am i wrong about that
i mean just just off the top of your
head if anybody's just sort of good at
good at math
you know this is one you don't have time
to do the math but on the top of your
head
if it's 70 times more spready we're done
in 30 days aren't we
somebody says 10 days you might not be
wrong
all right well
and i feel like if it were really that
fast
uh it would have
been more spread already but i guess it
starts slow sort of like the grade of
rice on the checkerboard if you know
that story
but here and it's also
uh
10 times
or the infection is
about 10 times lower in lung tissue
so it's 70 times more spready
but 10 times less infection in your lung
tissue which is where the problem would
be 10 times
how many people are going to die
with a virus that's 10 times less
effective than the ones that isn't
killing hardly anybody
it's a terrible sentence but you know
what i mean
um
you know the news is having a tough time
dealing with this because
all early indications are that this will
solve the pandemic
it will create
extra hospital impact even even in mild
form just because of the rapidity of it
it'll hit so many people at once
so
i doubt that the risk is zero i'm sure
people will die of omicron just like
they die of you know every other
medicine they take basically somebody
does
but damn
damn this
i i i think we're 30 days away from
uh the entire
you know
traditional way to handle this pandemic
just won't make any sense
as if it ever did
well remember i told you
that michael schellenberger keeps making
things happen
uh first in the nuclear domain and then
you saw that san francisco's mayor
completely changed her viewpoint that
was another thing that he and his group
were working on
and today
yet again
yet again so it turns out that
that uh the netherlands has now joined
the uk and france and announcing a major
expansion of nuclear
and uh
michael has a article on sub stack and
uh tweet thread
talking about uh how did this happen
like how did we so quickly
go from
nuclear is bad to let's build nuclear as
fast as we can
and the answer is that one of the people
over in the netherlands telling them
what they should have done is
michael shellenberger
[Laughter]
every place something is changing
he's there
he's the best persuader i've ever seen i
think
you know because and i've been trying to
figure out exactly what makes him so
effective one is that he argues from
data the other is that you actually
can't tell what his political
affiliation is
i mean i i know him pretty well
you know from you know this this sort of
stuff
uh and i don't know
i don't know
does he lean left or right
i know on social stuff
he had traditionally leaned left
but when it comes to hard analytics of
what works and what doesn't that's not
left or right
you know the hard analytics of it are
just numbers
and so he just does the numbers where
they come out
and
he doesn't give anybody a reason to be
against him
which is different isn't it have you
noticed that everybody who's a proponent
of just about anything
is also toxic
have you noticed that including me right
so i'm somewhat toxic because i'm sort
of in the fight you know you get slimed
with
every related thing
but somehow
schellenberger i think mostly by staying
out of the the true political parts of
the questions you know he's not backing
any candidate or anything
so i think
that may be the brilliant part of what
he did everybody thinks
everybody thinks
that he's on their side
and guess what
they're all right
everybody who thinks that michael
schellenberger is on their side
they're all right because he's on all of
their sides he's just telling you what
works and what doesn't that's it
there's nothing else there he's just
this works this doesn't based on the
data
you know debunk this debunk that
but
if you take his impeccable persuasion
skills
you add it with probably a
a better ability to analyze things than
anybody else who's in this conversation
my god
he is cutting a swath
through
bad opinions like nothing i've ever seen
now interestingly he picks the he picks
the domains
in which if you believed the correct
information
you get a better result
which is interesting that they even
exist
why does it exist that anybody thought
that say removing
you know defunding the police was going
to help
like why was that ever even the
conversation so he can get into
conversations where people are
completely irrationally blocked
and somehow break break the log jam it's
really remarkable so keep watching him
um
i asked this uh question
here's a primer for you if if you saw
that a
medical expert
disagreed with a
person who was an expert in data
analysis
and the disagreement was about the
validity of a study
so that's the only question the validity
of some study
and there was a expert who had every
medical qualification
and you know just really deep medical
qualifications that are exact to this
domain
the data analyst doesn't have any of
that
but is just good at looking at studies
and they disagree on whether the study
is good or bad which one do you believe
who do you trust
the expert
or the other expert
yeah the the correct answer is the data
analyst
because there's only one expert in the
story
see it's a trick question
i gave you a setup where there was only
one expert because if you're looking at
data that other stuff isn't going to
help you
it's
does the data look right did they do it
right did they have proper controls that
sort of thing
so
[Music]
um as uh as andres beckhaus points out
uh one of the things that dr mccullough
who we'll talk about
who was on joe rogan's uh podcast one of
the things that he tweeted the doctor
did is a study about people with young
people with myocardial artists
and they found that like 98 of them
had myocarditis
and these are people who had been
vaccinated so he tweeted that
now that's pretty
yeah look at this scott is waking up
right
so the doctor who's and a very highly
qualified expert both in
cardiology and i believe via virology if
i'm correct right the two most relevant
expertise
and he he says that these these uh
uh
that these vaccinated people
98 of them and their young
had had in fact myocarditis
so that's what the expert said and he
sent that around
um am i am i woke enough yet
does anybody think i'm woke enough now
on youtube there's somebody here say oh
now you're getting it aren't you
okay
but as we mentioned the the good doctor
is an expert in
cardiology and virology but not data
analysis not data analysis i'll tell you
somebody who's good at data analysis uh
andres backhouse who looked at that
tweet and informs us that
the 98 people who had myocarditis are
selected from a group of people who had
myocardials
does it sound like i said that wrong
no they found out that 98 of the people
with myocarditis have myocardial
carditis
that's what they found out
because they only study people who had
clear symptoms of myocarditis
if you study people that the doctors say
well that's definitely myocarditis
and then they look into it and they do
the imaging they go yep sure enough
there's some myocarditis there
what would you expect
all it says is doctors are pretty good
at spotting myocarditis
but
uh so that's what andres points out that
it was a completely misleading headline
uh
but this is something that you're
your doctor who is very qualified as far
as i can tell in all the relevant fields
except
data analysis
so i did as you requested and listened
to
dr mccullough on joe rogan and
here are some of my thoughts
he said a bunch of things i agree with
first of all
so for a long time i was listening and i
was thinking where's the provocative
part
because i agree with that i agree with
that i agree with that but as things
went it got a little more interesting
um
so he did not see doc the doctor did not
see some obvious conspiracy theory
to prevent um
hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin so it
didn't sound like he was
saying there was some organized
conspiracy
would you agree those who watched it
he was not
claiming that he was claiming
incompetence
now do i disagree
with the notion that there was
incompetence especially about early
treatment options
i do not disagree does anybody it was a
fog of war everybody trying as hard as
they could bureaucracies
blah blah you would expect massive
amounts of incompetence
as we you know struggle to get the right
answers
so i think that's a fair
characterization of what happened a lot
of incompetence but that's to be
expected
not not appreciated not expected
now
here are some claims uh and by the way
joe rogan i thought did a really good
job in in the interview
uh i don't know for those of you watched
it i thought
joe took just the right tone
of
letting the doctor speak
but pushing really hard on some
questions that the doctor wasn't quite
answering to my satisfaction
i i thought he did a really good job on
that
and
and it's really hard to hit that exact
tone where you're clearly being
skeptical about what he's saying but
you're still showing him full respect
because you don't want to shut him down
or make it
into some kind of a fight
so
i don't know if anybody really realizes
how good joe rogan is at this stuff
right i mean
who's better really it's hard to think
of anybody
especially because he gives them enough
time to say whatever they want my only
problem with that model is that there
should be an expert there
or an expert on the other side why
let me give you an example
when dr mccullough said one of the
reasons that we know uh in fact checkman
this because i don't wanna i don't want
to say a claim that he didn't make
so just correct me in real time if i say
something wrong
um
when joe rogan was asking him
effectively why haven't other countries
why is it if there's something going on
with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
why is it it's happening everywhere at
the same time
it's exactly the right question right
i've asked that question a number of
times
which is
if these things work
wouldn't there be
somewhere
on earth
where they're working
because even though you can imagine an
american conspiracy and even a global
conspiracy easy to imagine
but would it get every country because
every country had a pandemic
every one you you tell me there's not
one little country
that couldn't just say all right we're
going to use ivermectin because we don't
have vaccinations we'll just get rid of
it
so in order for the good the doctor's
opinion that the signal is very strong
we don't have a randomized controlled
trial everybody would like that but it's
impractical
uh within the time frame
um
he's saying that the signal of the
benefits of these drugs is so high from
studies that are not perfect
uh
and the risk is so low
that clearly it makes sense
and then joe kept pushing on that
question about why are these other
countries not having the big result and
then here's the payoff
and so then the doctor proved his thesis
by giving you several examples
where
ivermectin had completely
squashed
the pandemic in their country
so
are you good
so examples were peru mexico
i think he said it's a first level thing
in japan but the asian none of the asian
countries had trouble with it so i think
that's a special case
so let's just take two of them mexico
and i think india india might have been
on his list
um what would happen if you spend five
minutes
googling peru
and ivormecten
well you would find out
that it did not change anything in peru
so the claim that it worked in peru
there's no data to support that
in fact
the data says the opposite you can see
the introduction of it and you don't see
an effect
mexico no data to support it
uh india no data to support it
and there is that speculation that
ivermectin might take care of worms
so well that's what it's for so if it
did that it might help some people who
would have had one extra challenge to
get rid of that challenge maybe they can
survive the coven better but it wouldn't
be a direct effect on on the covet under
that
theory
so
if you believe that the doctor's
hypothesis is correct that these drugs
have a signal they're working
then you must explain to yourself why
his biggest examples
are clearly debunked
now how do i know the debunk isn't wrong
right
well as peru
don't you think if peru had used
ivermectin and just squashed squashed
the pandemic
you don't think more people would be
taking ivermectin
really
yeah if that really happened
this would be over
if that was true
clearly it's not true it's not true
anywhere in fact every example he gave
where people are using it with success
just doesn't exist
yeah and and you can check for yourself
just google it google his name or google
peru and ivormectin
just google it up you see for yourself
five minutes no any of his examples are
real
now
um given uh the andres backhouse example
where we saw that
at least in that one example apparently
we're not i can't read his mind right
but from the outside looking in it looks
like he misjudged
a data analysis
or at least mischaracterized it
secondly
the examples he used as the main things
that prove his point and here's my
problem with the the joe rogan model
if andre's back house was sitting in the
chair next to him
andres would take on his laptop and say
here you go
that example is debunked
what else she got
now that would be useful that's the show
i want to see
in fact if joe rogan is listening
could you bring back on one any one of
the doctors who have the you know
non-traditional views and bring on a
fact checker it doesn't have to be
andres you know he's in germany that
might be hard but just bring in a fact
checker doesn't even have to be in in
studio it could be
i think you could do it remotely right
but that's my request to not do the
rogue doctors unless you bring in a fact
checker now i don't want somebody who
just has the opposite opinion
because that's just a fight
you want somebody who doesn't have a
any dog any uh what is it any dog in the
race
bring on daniel dale
bring on cnn's fact checker daniel dale
just have them sit there as an
advertisement for cnn and say look
here's my fact checker here's my expert
and just have him work it on his laptop
because it's a three hour show right if
you've got a three hour show
you can just check all the facts right
there you don't have to wonder
um scott am i going to take the pfizer
pill
i will give you the same
answer i gave for the vaccinations i'm
going to wait as long as possible
i might
but i'm going to wait as long as
possible before i do
so
let's say what else did happen for that
i do think that the doctor was right
about the no early treatment protocols
but i feel like he has a data problem
about monoclonal antibodies
my understanding at the beginning of the
pandemic is that we knew from
pretty much the beginning at least i did
i did have some information that you
didn't have a long time before you had
it that regeneron
works i can't tell you how i knew that
but i knew it you know months before it
was public and
but the problem i understood is to make
enough of it
can anybody give me a fact check on that
my understanding is that the monoclonal
antibodies were mostly a problem of how
fast you could make it
um because i think that what uh dr
mccullough
may be interpreting as part of that
problem of you know bad early treatment
protocols is that some of it just wasn't
available
like even if you knew it worked you
couldn't get it
right
um but i would uh i think he's spot on
by saying we should have released the
doctors to
you know maybe be a little more creative
with their solutions
because i don't know what does or does
not work but
if if doctors were experimenting with
their custom with their people and
giving them hydroxychloroquine or
something i feel like the doctor should
have been able to do that so i agree
with them on on the big picture
so
here's my bottom line
um i'm gonna
i hate to do this but i just feel like
it's important
because we're all trying to understand
who's credible and who's not
and i have an impression of the good dr
mccullough that i'm going to share with
you now that i'm going to tell you in
advance feels unfair even even though
i'm going to say it
right this feels unfair
but i also think it's important and i
just want you to have this filter
you've heard the phrase it takes one to
no one
well when i watch
i watch dr mccullough
he's one of me
think
all right so that's the part that's the
provocative part and by one of me i mean
a uh grandiose narcissist
now there are several versions of
narcissists and i put myself in the
category of a grandiose narcissist it's
a specific kind there some of the
narcissists are just toxic and bad for
the world
it's not that kind
the grandiose narcissist
is trying to
build up their own image
self-image and reputation
but by doing something useful for the
world
and making sure that you knew it
right i do that every day
i don't think you could have a better
example of a grandiose narcissist than
me
i literally tell you that's my business
model all the time you know it's more
like my psychological model than my
business model but i combined them
and
i literally want to help as many people
as i can that's you know the books
that's why the topics of the books i
write or that that's why i do the micro
lessons that's why i do most of this
but
i'm also self-aware
that i do it because that feeds
something in me right
that you know maybe i'm not proud of
but it's sort of like capitalism
you know nobody would say greed is
a positive element
of life but if you don't have greed as
part of your
capitalism model it doesn't work so i
would say that narcissism is just one of
those
double-edged things that's obnoxious can
have a downside but in some cases
the the person who wants to change the
world
and get credit for it
is contributing is uh let's say uh
bill gates or uh elon musk
you know are they grandiose narcissists
i don't know
i mean i think
i think musk is his brain just doesn't
work like other people's so you can't
make any assumptions there but if they
are i hope so
i hope they are
because they talk like it they talk like
you know i'm doing the best i can to
help the world
in the biggest way that i can
so we don't know how they internally
process it so when when i hear dr
mccullough talk
um the the way he talks you know about
his own qualifications etc and how he's
you know the the only one who knows the
right answer and he's the lone voice in
the wilderness and
going on all the big talk shows and
stuff like that he strikes me as someone
who needs this to be
to work for him
i i feel like
i don't feel his motivation is monetary
because some of you are going to say oh
who's paying him or you know is there
some way
he thinks he's going to make money off
of lecturing or something
giving speeches i doubt it
i didn't pick that up at all now again
right nobody's a mind reader right so
anything i say about another person's
internal thoughts you should
automatically say
well you know how do you know that
that's the right stance to take
but it's just my impression
that his motivation looks like he really
wants to help i think that's real
by the way
so you know if you could pick a personal
doctor
pick this one
he looks like he's a really good doctor
because i think he really really wants
to help people
but it's because it feeds him as well
and there's nothing wrong with that
nothing wrong with that that's not a
criticism
but i think he has that personality
and having that personality myself
i'll tell you there's a risk to it
if
if my hypothesis is right that we have
that in common
which is you can easily blind yourself
that you found the thing that will
change the world
do you know how many times i thought to
myself
i think i found it
i might be the only one who found this i
just found something that changes the
world
do you know how many times i've had that
thought
and then i have to use every every power
of rationality
to like
squeeze it down and say
okay
maybe you're being a little too gullible
maybe you're being a little too
optimistic about you know omicron being
a vaccination
you know maybe you're a little too
optimistic about this fusion technology
you know that sort of thing
so the blind spot that uh a grandiose
narcissist would have and i'm putting
myself in this category
is a little too much optimism about weak
what we can do
you feel that
have you ever seen me do that
to have too much optimism about what i
can do just personally to
make the world a better place
right
yeah and uh reed gfk junior
[Laughter]
[Music]
all right
jfk jr is probably
uh i'm sorry uh rfk right it's uh rfk
um
his credibility is really low you know
that right
which is not to say he didn't get this
one right
but here's what doesn't help
reading one person's book
i want rfk to be on joe rogan's show
sitting right next to daniel dale or
some fact checker you know could be
andres or anybody else
and then we'll have a conversation about
rfk okay
but if you're saying read rfk's book
you're telling me to do something that i
know
to be psychologically crippling
because you would get one person's
opinion and no counterpoint
that is like
that's like you telling me hey i'd like
you to run a marathon but could you
start to start the marathon by cutting
off one of your legs
that's what it feels like
thank you torah i appreciate that
is rfk still alive yes
so
just know this every time you tell me to
read a book or listen to one expert
i automatically think you're not good at
uh
analysis
right nothing personal because as i
often say
nobody's good at anything unless they
practice it right or if they've been
trained or if they have skills so people
have been trained
in data analysis are good at it
and people who have not been trained
think they're good at it but they don't
know the difference
uh read all the books
[Laughter]
you're right
uh what about the elon musk tweet well
we talked about his tweet about me the
other day
um
all right
scott's uh peru debunking need your own
comparisons um well i'm not sure if the
point you're making is that the debunks
themselves get debunked
but i would tell you this if you look at
say who is it is it factcheck.org
who sometimes debunks things that are
true
but when you see
somebody debunk something that's true
there's a way that they do it
which is sort of avoiding the question
or or modifying the question as they go
until you're not really even on the same
topic by the end of the fact check have
you noticed that
but a fact check
that i usually depend on
is one that says the claim is x
here's the data that shows us wrong
usually i'm going to go with a fact
check on that one usually
because if the person who made the claim
wasn't even aware
that there was data that debunked it
that's a problem
now if the person said i'm aware of the
data that looks like it debunks it but
there's a problem with that debunk then
i'd be oh okay now it's a tie
but if the person making the claim is
not aware
of the argument against it or doesn't
include it in their presentation just so
you know that they know it
i go with a debunk in those cases
so look for the debunks on the on the
question of peru and ivermectins make
your own decisions
uh
dismissing japan is a mistake just watch
dr john campbell huh is dr john campbell
somebody who might have appeared on the
show without a fact checker sitting next
to him
i'm just guessing
i'm just guessing
how many times can i tell you the same
 thing
and you'll just say what about this
expert let's do it again
let's do it let's practice this
i'm going to tell you clearly as
possible that the last thing i'm
gonna take as credible is one rogue
expert talking to an interview who
doesn't know what the he's talking
about no that's not joe rogan he's great
at interviewing
um
so now you're supposed to say oh but
what about this expert who doesn't have
a fact checker
go ahead
see how that goes
can we just do this over and over again
until you give up
will you give up to tell me to
read this one book or this one expert it
never ever is a good idea not ever ever
ever
there will no it will not be an
exception
there will not be
but if there's an objective source that
shows the you know the plus and the
minuses and the whole picture i would
definitely like to see that
all right uh
ah
all right
just looking at your comments and i
think i'm just about done
yeah the new
the the thing that's missing from a live
stream
technology
is i would like to live stream and have
a split screen
with you know two remote or one remote
person and we're not there
now you think we are because you're
thinking of you know these um
streaming things that
combine things but they don't work
well enough to be a commercial item
so we're almost there if somebody like
google or something could create a zoom
alternative where i can do immediate
split screens and
and amazingly zoom doesn't do that
either
um
yeah multi-stream
that's what we need
we're only we're only just at the point
where
our wi-fi can handle that sort of thing
but we can do it now
doesn't instagram do that
i don't know i haven't used the
instagram live did they do that
uh it's in locals
no it isn't
it should be in locals but it's not
built in yet
uh are you still taking down att i think
they're gonna take down themselves
all right
yeah fact yeah restream none of those
solutions work if it runs through a
third-party software it's a
it's a non-starter you need one software
that does the whole thing as soon as you
add the other software you don't have a
stable solution
with the cats doing great stream yards
same problem yeah no third-party
software it's got to be
one piece of software that does it all
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
