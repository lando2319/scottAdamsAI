come on in did you think I wouldn't be here
yeah we got stuff to talk about let's uh get the comments working
and then we've got a show
[Music] good morning everyone and welcome to
Coffee with Scott Adams the best thing that ever happened to you if you'd like to uh try to take this experience up to
levels that no one can even understand with their tiny shiny human brains
well all you need for that is a copper a mug or a glass a tanker chalice or stein
a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine end
of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called that's right the simultaneous sip go
tremendous incredible well after uh after the show today um
Owen Gregorian will be hosting a spaces
so anybody who wants to uh follow up on anything that we talked about today or I
guess anything else uh go to go to X and search for Owen Gregorian or you can go
to my X account and you'll see the link after the show
well you probably heard that last night the USA attacked uh three Iranian
nuclear sites it is being called a spectacular success
and I have to say the uh US military is very impressive so congratulations to
everybody involved so it looks like u they did exactly what they wanted to do
um and that would mean that America is officially in a new war
so um here we are now you might say to
yourself well it's not really a new war it's a limited strike unless Iran
retaliates which they say they will in which case
we'd have to do another limited strike so we're definitely in the war now no
doubt about that um but the good news is we seem to be
winning winning solves a lot of problems um Mike Benz is pointing out that the
plot of the real world is uh suspiciously like the plot of Top Gun
Maverick where uh you know a precision strike had
to be made and the world was at risk if we didn't do it and anyway looks very
very movie familiar um so if you did not hear the news there
were three nuclear sites that were targeted for now the big one um then
Natans and Isvahan which I didn't even know was a place but
now I do and I guess uh all three were the the uh major Iranian Iranian
i do you have the same problem I do if you're not sure how to pronounce Iranian
I know it's not Iranian but Iranian is that correct i don't know
they have 92 million people that's all I know
anyway um so one of the questions that I was having before the attack is I was
questioning whether in the real world we could drop two uh of these mops these uh
you know enormous bombs in the same hole
and I was suggesting that that was a little bit optimistic
sounded a little bit like the Star Wars you know have to hit exactly the the uh
air vent or something and I thought really really we're we're going to we're
going to take these bombers and they're going to take off from thousands of
miles away and they're going to fly for 18 hours and then they're going to drop
two bombs in the same hole from you know godwaffle height in the
air and I said to myself I don't think so no no so indeed uh they did not drop
two bombs in the same hole uh apparently apparently they did it six
times in a row so as far as we know
there were 12 of these uh mops or these gigantic bombs that were dropped into
six holes which if I've done my math right means
that not only do they know how to drop two bombs in one hole they can do it six times in a row
and then I guess two other bombs were dropped presumably in the same hole at
one of the other sites but they uh they used 12 of them on just four now now I
was also saying how do we how do we know that we got everything
and we you know it's hard it's hard to know exactly you know what what got destroyed
and what didn't i'll talk about that but one way to make sure that you didn't
miss anything is to drop 12 of them how many of you thought even thought that
was possible as recently as yesterday we we were
talking about well two two of them should do the job
and then some people were saying you know it might take as many as six i'm like whoa no way six of those bombs and
then other people were saying that we only had 12 that the entire US arsenal was only 12
of them but apparently we dropped 14 if you count the two that were dropped on
the other facility so out of our 12 alleged uh MOP bombs we
dropped 14 of them 14 out of 12 so I don't know how many we have left but
obviously we're not good at estimating how many we have um also uh submarines
fired 30 cruise missiles mostly at the uh non Ford hour sites Natans and
Isvazan isahan okay and then two additional mops were
dropped on Natans um apparently our military pulled off a
good decoy move where they moved some B1 bombers that were sort of conspicuous
um and reported in the news and they were decoys so the real bombers were
coming in from another direction but Trump also uh misled them by suggesting
that they had a maximum of two weeks which I interpreted as he'd probably
wait two weeks and my thinking was that he would let Israel take the first
attempt but I would conclude at this point that probably Israel did not have the ability
to destroy these sites or at least to do it in a time frame that was acceptable
so then we have to ask the question um did Israel drag the United States
into a neverending war because I don't know how this ends we'll talk about that
in a minute but uh I would release on the assumption that Israel was telling
the truth when it said they could take care of it themselves so that was
probably another fake out or or was it just an ordinary political
lie i don't know but I would rule out the the option that Israel ever had a
chance of doing it themselves but they did suggest that they could so maybe
that was for the the Iran consumption not us well we'll find out more about
that as time goes on um
then uh I saw one report that I don't know it couldn't possibly be true that
two of these bombs were dropped or that some of the the bombs were dropped down the ventilation shafts did you hear that
do you think it's possible that not only can they drop two bombs in a hole six
times in a row but they can aim at the ventilation shafts and my next question
is if they knew where the ventilation shafts were didn't they already have a
way to destroy it are you telling me there's nothing you can dump down a
ventilation shaft that would be explody or poison or something i don't know
apparently there's uh no no sign yet of any radiation so that would be good now
the uh the satellite pictures that I described with the six uh holes
one question I have is I at least I have four now um the the clusters of the
holes were there would be three over here maybe at the entrance and then
there would be three pretty far away maybe at the main facility i don't know
so my my next question is did we have such a detailed understanding of what
the bunker looked like that we knew exactly where they kept the good stuff
in addition to where the entrance was so I have a question what about all that
stuff between the two bomb sites because if you look at the map it looks
like there's a fairly extensive distance between a cluster of three holes and the
other cluster of three holes so again I'm guessing that one was the entrance
the main entrance and one was maybe the main facility but there's also reporting
that the day or two before the strikes there was a lot of truck activity at
that site so did they know the attack was coming
and did they load up all the important stuff on trucks and move it to other
protected sites and is it even the kind of stuff that you can move it could be
that trying to move it would be you know impossible
or maybe not maybe they had always planned that they might have to move it someday so they made sure that they
could so one of the things we don't know is did they move anything out before the
bombing and then we also don't know if they collapsed everything that needed to
be collapsed or is there still some way that Iran could later dig out something
useful we don't know we may never know
but as of today um everybody seems to be treating it
like a major success and I will um I will temporarily accept that narrative
because there's no evidence that it didn't work and those are some big ass
bombs and dropping 12 of them on one place probably suggests you know what
you're doing so I'm going to give them uh the benefit of assuming that that
much capability is backed by some good thinking as well
so at the moment I would say it all looks pretty good pretty good now I had
uh suggested that you know maybe Trump would wait
um because he would be looking for other other options but the surprise attack is
pretty smart because it fooled me and it looks like it might have fooled Iran too
anyway Iran uh complained a little bit that uh they thought the US was in
negotiation mode but Iran never once acted like negotiations
weren't going to work so that's a little bit disingenuous for Iran to say "Hey I
thought you were negotiating." No you didn't because they knew they weren't negotiating
anyway so Iran now has announced that um they have a right to self-defense as
they call it which probably has nothing to do with self-defense
so they're going to call it self-defense because that's easy to defend you know
everybody has a right to self-defense but what is it exactly that Iran plans
to do to the United States that would stop us from doing whatever we wanted the next time we want to do it
and as far as they know the the US is done so what would they be defending
against you know they could defend against Israeli attacks because those are ongoing but we just said we're done
and there's good reason to believe we're done so why would you call it
self-defense when there's nothing to defend against except you know what's
already happened which makes no sense so no it would not be self-defense if
anything it would be more like uh Iran trying to save face
um and maybe keep their regime in power by acting as though the big uh Satan as
they like to call us um can't get away with this you can't get away with this
so I think it has everything to do with hating the United States and needing to
hurt Americans so that their uh regime will look like they're they're not
toothless um the IRGC the uh Republican Guard is that what
they're called anyway the uh main military of Iran uh the ones that matter
anyway said uh today's act of aggression by the terrorist American regime
terrorists uh has granted the Islamic Republic of Iran the legitimate right to
act in self-defense again is it really self-defense if we're not fighting them
whatsoever and we're done including they say through options that go beyond the
delusional calculations of the aggressor coalition all right so it might be just talk
but Iran does seem pretty violent so I wouldn't assume it's just talk however
when they say something that would go beyond our delusional calculations
um that would suggest maybe cyber attacks maybe terrorist attacks on the homeland
here's the problem there's probably some low level of
response that would make it look like well at least they did something that
would not be so big that America would have to respond to the response
so it's kind of a a narrow little window of options if you imagine for example
some major terrorist attack happening in the United States as as what they would
call self-defense do you think that Trump would let that go
do you think he would say "All right we're even we took out your nuclear you
did a terrorist attack we'll call it even." No no we We would escalate
so is there really much that Iran can do that isn't going to be bad for Iran and
the answer is probably not almost everything they do will either be too
weak or we will respond again and they're not
going to like that at all probably a regime change situation I would guess
um I heard a uh CNN pundit say the other day and this is not authoritarian but
just somebody who was one of their experts
said that uh the reason that they enriched to the threshold of nuclear
weapons is not because they wanted to make nuclear weapons do you know what the real reason was
according to one pundit and I have no reason to think he's right but just so
you hear this perspective um that the reason that they would get so close to being able to make a weapon
without actually having any signs of intention of making the weapon except that they keep you
know crawling up to the line is so that they would have a a chip to trade
for a reduction ction in in US sanctions on their economy does that sound even a
little bit like that would be their strategy because I was saying why would they do
it you know unless they actually plan to make a nuclear weapon what would what
would be the reason for making everybody want to kill them literally kill them to
stop them from doing what they're doing which is looking sort of like they want
a nuclear weapon and that they have a specific reason for it which would be to
destroy the big Satan and the little Satan so maybe
um and the only reason I think that maybe that's true is because it's the
same mistake that Saddam Hussein made do you remember that Saddam Hussein right
until the end pretended that maybe he did have weapons of mass destruction
because that would scare his regional neighbors and we probably destroyed his entire
country and killed him because he did a good job of pretending he had nuclear weapons or at least
weapons of mass destruction so is it possible
that Iran made the same mistake of pretending that they wanted nuclear
weapons any moment but really it was just something to trade away it doesn't
feel like it to me because they didn't look like they wanted to trade anything away they they were so adamant that it
was not on the table you know wouldn't they have at least offered it once you know if you drop the
sanctions then we'll drop our enrichment or something i don't know my next
question is apparently they had already enriched a bunch of fuel
um up to 60% which is very close to 90 apparently getting from 60 to 90 is a
small deal compared to getting to 60 um
so did they do all that and then leave the fuel inside those nuclear facilities
that we just bombed how how much uh
how much of a container does it take to store all of that enriched fuel enriched
uranium and move it somewhere else wouldn't you imagine that even if we
took out all of their big equipment that they would have hidden their actual
already enriched fuel someplace unexpected as in not in Fordo
so how would we know and what you know what mischief could they get into with
what they already have because it's not quite refined to where they need it but
it's right up there um I saw one message from some Russian
guy who is not that dependable who said that uh that countries would be willing
to give Iran nuclear weapons does that sound true
what country would give Iran a nuclear weapon no matter how much of an ally
they are do you think China's going to say "You know what you lost your nuclear weapons but we want to be friends and
keep buying your oil so why don't you take a couple of ours?" No no no country
is going to give up their nuclear weapons now maybe North Korea
might sell them something maybe but uh not right away
anyway so one of the uh questions that I ask is what would be our method for
knowing how well our bombing worked how would we know for example if they moved
anything out would we know well apparently the uh Israelis have an
impressive uh network of spies
and those spies apparently are in all the right places because Israel has an
incredible understanding of where all their leaders are and everything else so it must be a pretty
you know pretty effective spy network so this but the spies are only going to
know what the Iranian leadership knows at best
would the Iranian leadership even know if there was anything inside Ford now
that they could salvage not for a long time so even Iran doesn't
know what the bomb damage is they just know they can't access it right away but
at some point the uh bombing will stop and Israel will not be controlling their
skies and the US will back off and what will happen when they start digging up
the uh the nuclear facility at Hordau we
don't know there might be something in there maybe not
um but the spies won't know because the uh Iranians would not know right away um
I don't think you can tell by looking at it so I saw the satellite pictures and
there's some impressive holes in the ground so let me tell you those mops
those bombs they uh they leave quite a crater so if you imagine that they were
in exactly the right place or they somehow were engineered to take
down everything even though they only hit in two locations then that would assume that things are pretty well
destroyed but I don't think we know that and I don't know that you can tell by
looking at a satellite picture because I imagine I always imagined the
underground facilities would have bomb doors every x number of feet
so that no matter what you blew up you know it was designed to be contained in
you know some area and not get the whole thing i don't know i've never built a underground nuclear facility but if I
did that's how I'd do it um but on the other hand it could be that
uh the US said you know if we dropped two of these mops on that place we
probably could get most of it and then somebody else said "You know if we
dropped four mops we'd really be confident that we got
everything." And then somebody else said who was also at the meeting "Four
you wimp we should do six." And then somebody else said "Six
you wimp we should do eight." And then it stopped at 12 because that was all they had they had to use two for the
other one but uh you know once you drop 12
12 of these bumps you know it could be that it it creates
such a uh um an earthquake that it guarantees you get everything
maybe so it it might be that we don't have to do a lot of bomb dam bomb damage
assessment BDA that all they have to do is say we dropped 12 mops on you and
nothing can survive that if it's underground maybe maybe that's all they need
anyway um according to CNN there they've got rumors or at least one
person believes that Iran has been building some tunnels that uh we did not
target now what are the odds that Iran had some obvious targets but
they had some extra tunnels maybe in other places in which they made
sure they had not everything but maybe just enough you know maybe a centrifuge
here or there maybe a little bit of a processor something so how long would it
take before we know if Iran was smart enough to not hide all of their things
in facilities that had names like here's our nuclear enrichment site
do you do you think they were smart enough that they they distributed it
across multiple sites which would be the obvious thing to do or do you think they
said you know we've got three well-labeled well-known sites let's keep
everything in there cuz they were built to house these things so we'll just keep
it right there i don't know how long will it take before we know if we got it
all i don't know i don't know if anybody knows
anyway um on the plus side um it was a very impressive military
exercise so the military as far as we can tell gets an A++ because they not
only did it demonstrate power which is always good you know we always say about
all of our uh enemies we say they don't understand anything but strength
we we act like we act like we're the only country that can operate on reason
and that every other country just operates on strength no the only thing they understand is bombs we say that
about everybody we need to bomb sometimes it might be true u but it
might be true in this case but the US demonstrated not only power
but u pulled off a highly complicated um multi-refueling
lots of aircraft there were support planes there was coordination there was a need for secrecy so
apparently the the uh success in keeping it a secret not only in the United
States but everywhere else was really impressive of so be exath
um as of this moment we might learn something we don't know but as of this
moment wow nicely done so he he got uh
let's say eggs has been uh baptized under fire and so far it looks like he
was 100% successful now Ask yourself how many ways could
this have gone wrong and the answer is a lot of ways you remember uh Jimmy Carter
trying to free the hostages in Iran during his his reign and the helicopters
took on sand and just they sort of broke and the whole thing was considered a
debacle and that could have happened and it
looks like there were a hundred ways that this could have gone wrong
but if you pull off an operation that looks this successful
when it had so many moving parts and so many different parts of the military to
be involved from you know the communication to the um the flights that
were suppressing fire to all of it every bit of it looks like wow very impressive
so great job military
Um apparently the US told Iran through some back channels that these strikes
would be contained so again we're trying to reduce the odds that they need to do
this big revenge because if they're smart and we don't know if they are but
if they're smart they will treat the US involvement like it's over and just you
know don't do any uh what would you call it the uh
um there's an error there there's a
I'll think of it there's a name for that anyway so Haggath
gave his uh press um his press event today
they did not mention the double hauling of the the mops you know the two bombs
in each hole but they did say there were 12 of them and there there are six holes so it does look like that's what they
did um and uh let's see what else did we learn
from that um and we were reminded by Hagsath that when Trump says they're not
going to have nuclear weapons that he doesn't bluff so one of the things that you're hearing
a lot of people say is Trump doesn't bluff and I'm trying to remember
where did that come from because Trump definitely bluffs when
he's pretending that he's negotiating but he's really sending bombers over so
he totally bluffed that he was waiting two weeks that was that was a bluff
right um but we we we still act like he doesn't
bluff and he doesn't bluff when it comes to the big stuff you know the main theme he
doesn't bluff about that he does bluff about maybe some of the details you know
how we get there um when we're going to move how we're going to move how it's
going to be done that stuff yeah yeah you might bluff on that but when it
comes to the big thing that he's been saying for decades that Iran can't have a nuclear weapon that's not a bluff and
uh I think he reinforced that idea nope not a bluff
um let's see what else do we need to know
skipping ahead here um so Israel's uh Netanyahu
uh did a video statement um commending Trump and thanking him and I want to
show you how capable Netanyahu is with his communication
if uh if you were Netanyahu what would you be trying to accomplish
with your video statement after the fact well you would want to thank the United
States um you would want to thank Trump and you
would want to compliment him and you would want to stay on his side and you
would want to make sure that he felt good about what he did because you know the entire relationship
is kind of hangs on it so here are some of the things that Netanyahu said
which honestly are kind of brilliant so this is a persuasion lesson just
listen to how Netanyahu paces Trump now I've taught you about
pacing and leading pacing is when you match the style of the person you're
trying to persuade in this case he's trying to persuade Trump that Trump did
a great thing and that Israel loves him and they're the best partners ever all
right but listen to the exact words so Netanyahu starts out by saying
"President Trump and I often say peace through strength first comes strength
then comes peace." So do you see the pacing he he starts out with uh we agree on
this major idea that peace or strength now he didn't have to say that but it's
a perfect thing to say because it reinforces uh Trump's philosophy
and it says he agrees with it and uh he starts with that so he's already he's
already brilliant all right then he says uh he described Trump as quote a strong
leader of the free world and a great friend of Israel and a friend like no other a friend like no other
now do you think that Trump likes to hear that he's a strong leader yeah yeah
that would be right at the top of the list of things he would want to hear from another leader so
so Netanyahu lays down he's a strong leader and yeah f first of all it's uh
that would be supported by the facts but secondly to hear him say it is also
important so that's good but then you see this phrase that he's a great friend
of Israel and a friend like no other what does Trump do all the time his most
common communication um technique
so when Trump is talking about something that worked out he says stuff like "Nobody's ever seen this before it's the
best that's ever happened nothing has ever compared to this." Right that's how
he talks and notice how Netanyahu matched him he's he's not just a friend
he's not just a great friend he's a friend like no other
that's Trumpism a friend like no other
that that is a perfect pace for uh Trump's own communication style and then
it gets he goes on and Netany Netanyahu called the US
strikes a quote a pivot of history for Middle East prosperity and peace and
saying that Trump's leadership created a transformative moment
um by acting against it how much do you think Trump who was complaining uh all
yesterday no the day before about how he doesn't get a Nobel Peace Prize for all
the things he's done and he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize but of course he'll never get one because they only give
them to liberals so for Netanyahu to say that this is a
pivot in history and it's a pivot toward prosperity and peace and all that is
right on message with what Trump himself was saying about himself which is hey
I'm doing all these things which are he didn't use the phrase but you know they changed history and they changed it for
the better and I'm not getting credit for it so Netanyahu gives him credit for
it the pivot of history and then he says Netanyahu says "We worked as a team like
perhaps no team has ever worked before." Do you see it yet
have I taught you to spot this yet it's just he he doesn't say we worked
effectively as a team that would be the normal thing you say he says "We worked
as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before in the history of teams in
in the entire world history no team has ever worked as effectively as this."
That's pure Trump pure Trumpism that there's never been a
team that worked as effectively as this one so
no matter what you think of Netanyahu or Israel you have to you have to give it
up for their communication skills they're really good at the communication
thing um anyway um of course Iran Iran uh did
some missile attacks on Israel last night there were no new deaths confirmed
but there were 16 injuries in Hifa and Tel Aviv which would suggest that uh
either Iran is holding off and waiting to do you know maybe one big missile
attack and saving all the missiles or they're running out of missiles or
running out of launchers or they don't want to use them up so we don't know
exactly why but the number of missile related deaths in Israel seem to be down
but the the Iranian parliament has
reportedly just ordered that they're going to try to close the the straits of Hormuz
where uh allegedly 20% of global oil production goes through it but
um I don't know if that's going to happen because that would hurt their own allies more than it would hurt their
enemies so apparently China and uh maybe mostly
China would be affected by this but the United States not so much you know we
don't have that much depending on the straight of Hormuz but some of our allies do and I guess there are some
pipelines that work around it etc so so maybe if uh Iran closes the straight of
Hormuz maybe we just I don't leave it closed
maybe we don't have to fix that maybe China would say "All right all right you
made your point you close it for a week but now you have to open it." Or maybe
they'll close it only to certain types of ships but uh certainly there would some be
some uh you know big response if they do that we'll see all right let's talk
about the exit strategy how does the United States and Israel
too how do they get out of this if you're Israel
you have said um our main goal is to get rid of the nuclear facilities but now
they're gone so is Israel going to pack up today and
stop bombing because their main goal of getting rid of the nuclear plants is
over oh no oh no that's right they added another goal
i don't remember when they added it but it wasn't on day one was it but they
added they have to get the ballistic missiles as well so I guess they stay until they think
they have all the ballistic missiles or all the missile launchers
so what will Israel say is their objective now that the nuclear threat
allegedly has been suppressed um they've got a problem if as some
people say their real goal is regime change and they don't say that by the
way but if their real goal is regime change they have to stay
and what happens if they just stay and they just keep bombing stuff and maybe
they maybe now is the time that they take out the regime
would that make sense if they plan to do it wouldn't they have done it before i
don't know but allegedly um the uh Ayatollah has has already
picked three people who would be his successors but he is wisely not naming them in public because they would start
exploding right away i assume that we know you know what 10 people are likely
to be a successor so if Israel wanted to kill them they'd probably be half of
them would be dead by now so it looks like um neither the US nor Israel are
actively trying to do regime change but they might kind of wish for it the least
likely outcome is the is is the public of Iran rising up and replacing their
own leaders at the same time that Israel is bombing them that's not going to happen
so how do they get out um
and is there any way that Israel and or the United States could effectuate
that's a word I say I've never used before in public now that I've heard it I'm going to use it a lot how how can
they cause a a friendly regime to take over in Iran that's That's not really
possible is it i don't I don't feel like it would last even if they if they
succeeded so what do you do
um apparently uh a lot of major US cities
are now on alert because they think um maybe Iran snuck
in a bunch of terrorists and they could do some damage in the United States but
again I would say unless Iran just wants to destroy whatever's left of their
country that they should just treat the United States like we're done
as much as they need revenge if they go after the homeland United States of
course we're going to respond and it will be bigger than the response on the
nuclear sites i mean maybe we would go after the leadership i don't know so if
I had to guess I would guess that they would not do a terrorist act in the United States
um I would worry about a false flag but I would not imagine they would attack
the United States because that would just be national suicide but they have
done some things that look like you would only do it if you were planning on national suicide so can't rule out
i've been uh curious about the trolls that have been coming after me on on X
because I wonder if they're professionals or bots but they all have a the similar kind of attack first of
all they follow me which is the first signal of the troll they follow me
without liking me all right how often do you follow somebody you don't like just so you can
troll them uh and then no matter what I say they come after me personally for
either my lack of credentials or they try to mock me it's like oh oh let's see
what the cartoonist says about military action let's see what the cartoonist says and
um it's all personal attacks so are those real people
i I act like they're they're not but are they are are those actually
Americans who disagree but they don't have reasons so they just do personal
attacks oh let's see what the cartoonist says and then the the recent one
is why would you spend your last days on Earth you know cuz they're making a
reference to me dying uh why would you spend your last days with such bad
opinions and they won't even mention what's wrong with the opinion you know they're just pure trolls
so are those are they paid are they foreign or are they actually just
Americans who are total i don't know but I don't give them too
much power well here's some uh some reactions from
uh various places um MSNBC I sampled their
their coverage this morning and it looked like they might lean on the um
Trump did this without approval from Congress so it was an unconstitutional
attack um now that's pretty weak if that's all
they got cuz you know the commanders and chiefs have been acting without
Congress's approval for a while and not just Republicans so it's sort of a weak
attack but it's all they have um but you have to watch if you can see a clip of
Rachel Matto interviewing somebody oh my god her face
she She's got total uh drama crap face like
because she's very unhappy but what are you going to say about this
wildly successful military action that reduced one of the biggest risks that we
had in the world or or at least it looks like this you you have to see her face
it is hilarious that she can wind your face up into that and and scrunch it up
like that uh one of the uh MSNBC hosts whose name
I don't know was very impressed by the uh the operation so he was impressed uh
in a very visual way meaning that he he could barely he couldn't contain how
impressed he was how good the American military was in this operation so that's
not what you expect um and I have a hypothesis that winning
fixes just about everything if Trump wins and there's a good chance of that
meaning that um he accomplishes an objective and and keeps it limited that
would look like a big win if he does that then even his critics are going to
have to melt away they're just they're going to have to just change the subject basically and it looks like that might
happen maybe at least a 50% chance
um Hakee Jeff as a sort of a leader in the Democrat
side has to come up with something that makes Trump look like he made a mistake
so he put out a statement that said the risk of war has now dramatically
increased okay but the risk of being uh the victim
of a nuclear attack hasn't that decreased and then he said that uh Trump misled
the country meaning America on his intentions
yes he did he did mislead the he misled the country uh at least in acting like
he was looking for more negotiations while in fact he was planning an attack
but that was part of what made the attack successful is that he had a fake out so do we care
that he quote misled the country because he didn't mislead the country when he
said um Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon i would say that part was really
clear um and then Hakee Jeff points out that
that Trump did not get congressional approval that's all he had
so that that was the worst criticism is that the risk of war has
dramatically increased while at the same time the risk of nuclear annihilation has greatly
decreased at least for a while misled the country which was intentional
because it helped the attack and did not get congressional approval which none of
our recent presidents have done that's it that That was the best he had
that's That's a lot of nothing right there uh then the Wall Street Journal
editorial board uh they were all proTrump on this they
said uh President Trump's decision to strike Iran's three most significant nuclear sites helped rid the world of a
grave nuclear threat and it was a large step toward restoring US deterrence
creates an opportunity for peace they loved it so the Wall Street Journal they
were all in and then uh Van Jones was on CNN before
the attack so this is before the attack and he says "I think progressives
underestimate how dangerous Iran is iran is not a normal country normal countries
don't blind women because they showed some hair they don't empower little gangs and proxies to surround a country
and fire rockets and rape people they cannot have a bomb because they say
death to America death to Israel and death to all the Jews." One of those should offend you if you're
progressives or at least one should offend you and we cannot have a nuclear
armed Iran now that's before the attack
so Van Jones right on CNN um suggesting that being tough in Iran
would make perfect sense um and then uh Constantine Kissen
who you know from X and from podcasting he's a he's a very smart guy he says the
result of October 7th you know the October 7th attack on on Israel the
result of October 7th has been the annihilation of Hamas annihilation of Hezbollah and the annihilation of Iran's
nuclear enrichment facilities and regional ambitions boy
that is true october 7th was the free pass that Israel needed to unleash uh
hell on uh all the proxies and on Iran and they did so that I I do believe I
agree with Constantine that that could be traced back to October 7th so October
7th was probably the biggest miscalculation
that any country's ever made it's I mean that's right at the top of boners
um so Vladimir Putin had uh what Net News
and others are calling a surprising reason for not providing war aid to to
their their ally Iran and it said that uh Israel has two
million Russianspeaking people and that Israel is almost a Russianspeaking
country and that if he were opposed to Israel he
would be opposed to two million residents who were Russian speaking and
he'd be basically opposed to his own people now
do do you have the same feeling I do which is uhoh
that that that's how he got Crimea isn't it by claiming that there were a lot of Russian speakaking people there
now I don't think he's going to try to conquer Israel because they have a lot of Russian speakers there but that was a
variable that I had never seen um and from the perspective of is that a
is that a good answer for the public it really is so Putin as I've often said uh
I'm not a Putin lover i know he's a dangerous killer
but boy is he good at this stuff he's so good at this that was a very unexpected
response and it makes you shut up right away you're like "Oh oh well I never
thought of it that way." But that's actually a pretty good reason
um in other news that does not have anything to do with the war believe it
or not there are things happening um according to Newsmax Canada is
experiencing a big drop in US travelers
so apparently an 11% drop in American tourists going to or driving to Canada
in April and there was an 8% drop in May now
uh there is also a big drop in Canadians visiting the United States
how many of you think any of that's going to last doesn't it seem like we should be done
with that by now it seems to me like we should just
loosen up all right in the in the long run Canada is going to be our friend
right it's not it's not going to go the other way it it's not going to be like
things get so bad in Canada that you know we put up a uh
a national defense against them attacking or something no we already
know that no matter what happens we're going to be friends with Canada
so why don't we just get over this travel thing and just travel and let the
let the government do what the government does but on an individual basis
let's let's just travel you know let's just get over it there there's nothing
to be gained by boycotting the other at the at the retail level
anyway according to Reclaim the Net uh Obama was recently speaking at some
event and if I feel like every time Obama speaks it's now just embarrassing
for Democrats he he used to be so capable but I feel like he lost his fast
ball entirely so the only news that comes out of this event is that he wants
more uh he wants more censorship online and wants the government to control what
people say that is so not a good look
but okay that that would be one more reason not to elect Democrats
um according to Blaze Media Andrew Chap Chapos is writing about this did you
know that uh Trump's supporters have more babies
apparently there's a fairly big difference so the people who are
anti-Trump or voted Democrat have a much lower fertility rate
now does that surprise anybody that's probably the least surprising
statistic you've seen because Republicans are family oriented and find
meaning in forming families and having kids and doing all that and uh the
Democrats um are much less of that
so Democrats would have to bring in um illegal migrants in order to get some
political power because their numbers are going to decrease relative to uh
Republicans and Republicans are just outbreeding them so if you want to know
where the future is going Republicans are outreeding Democrats
that probably will have a big difference in the in the long run
we'll see meanwhile over in Japan according to
wonderful engineering uh Japan found a cheap metal that can
produce a thousand% more hydrogen in electrolysis
so electrolysis would be the way you create hydrogen which would be a a green
fuel but you don't want to use a lot of electricity to make your green fuel
because you're you're going to break even or come out behind but if you've got this cheap new metal
that's a thousand times more efficient um then suddenly hydrogen looks like a
terrific idea so that's coming down the pipeline
and the New York Post is reporting that the Pelosis uh had another great year of investments
and as you know uh Congress can legally
do insider trading so they can make trades based on their secret knowledge of what's going to happen whereas you
and I cannot do that legally but Congress had carved out an exception for
themselves and uh Pelosi and her husband who's a um he's an investor by trade
uh they rad in millions last year and apparently they had an estimated 54%
return in 2024 which is more than double the S&P 500
and they beat every large hedge fund so
uh and some of those trades seem to be suspiciously timed for things that the
government knew about all right and then lastly in other good
news according to interesting engineering um
Korea South Korea has come up with some new windows
that are just amazingly efficient at uh cutting temperature so um if you're
looking at what's going to happen to electricity in this country or the world
um they may have come up with a major major improvement so they can cut the
temperature by 80° and uh windows are a major source of
lost heat so apparently it's not a static window it looks like it's sort of an electrified window where they can
send a little current in it it changes the characteristic of the window depending on what you need and uh that
seems like a boring topic but it's one of the biggest uses of um
electricity is overcoming the weakness of your windows because if your windows
let in too much heat you got to run your AC forever to compensate so some of that
might change anyway so that's all I had to uh to talk about um I'm hoping that
Owen Gregorian is uh in place and he will soon be firing
up a spaces event spaces is the audio only event on X so if you're on X you
can find the link by looking at my uh Twitter feed as Scott says you'll see it
right at the top or you can look for Owen Gregorian and you'll see the link
to the spaces thing at the top of his uh X feed as well so that's all I got for
today i'll uh say a few words privately to my beloved uh subscribers on Locals
and the rest of you uh we'll keep an eye on the news and see what else is going to blow up but uh I'll see you same time
tomorrow and locals i will
