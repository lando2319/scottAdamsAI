after
that
good morning everybody
and welcome to coffee with Scott Adams
often called the highlight of
civilization
reportedly
and today not only do we have two
separate live streams going but do you
see what's behind me do you see that
that's right it's a white board
it's a whiteboard and
special iPad
visuals it's like everything today
everything well there's one thing I
haven't mentioned the one thing that
we'll take it up to levels unheard of
it and all you need for that is a copper
mugger a glass of tanker jealous to sign
the canteen joke or flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
oh
yeah
it's good
that's good
so if you noticed anything in the news
lately anything interesting
yes all of it this is like the best news
day ever
you don't want to miss
one second of today's live stream it's
going to be so good starting with do you
remember the Canadian teacher who is
identifying now as a female
but looks exactly like and I don't mean
to be unkind
a middle-aged man with a blonde wig and
Beach ball-sized prosthetic breasts
now some people had speculated
that this person was maybe playing a
long prank
other people have said no no
this person is just identifying and
might have a different preference for
breast size than than maybe you did and
her preference is
this big
okay
people are different
well today we learned that uh that now
this is from 4chan all right now 4chan
can go either way right
Fortune can either
be a prank itself or they can uncover a
prank
so Fortune is a little tricky because
you never know when they're joking or
they're you know they're uncovering
somebody
but according to at least one person on
4chan
who knows somebody who is in this
teacher's class before the transition
and that person reports the said teacher
was very anti-woke
had a big problem with all the wokeness
and that maybe it was becoming kind of a
problem kind of a problem in his job
now her
now
any questions
[Laughter]
I don't think we can know a hundred
percent what's going on here
but this is the this is exactly the
hypothesis that fits all the data
because because she looks exactly like
he playing a long prank and is very
committed to it
now remember what I said there are two I
said there were two possibilities there
probably more but two big ones one is as
a prank and if that's true if this gets
confirmed
hero he's my hero
and if it's not a prank
still a hero I just love that somebody
would live there live their life and not
care what anybody else thought
I just like that I I generally like
anybody who's non-standard I don't know
if you've noticed that many of you
automatically rebel against the the
non-standard you know the more
non-standard they are the more you Rebel
and I have it the opposite instinct
which is as soon as I see somebody
violating all of your expectations
I think you have my attention
we could be friends
yeah we could be friends
so I always like the people who are
non-standard no matter what it is right
just generally speaking so I I'm loving
this person
but uh
I feel we need to take this another
level
don't you
I feel like
this is almost perfect if it's a prank
and if it's not a prank
I have the same recommendation I stole
this by the way it's so good I had to
steal it
I feel we should create a movement
to get this teacher on the cover of
Sports Illustrated or Victoria Secrets
do you see any reason not to
seriously is right by here who sees any
reason
any reason at all
that this teacher should not be on the
cover of Sports Illustrated
because I think we have a brave
body positive
role model
I mean right looks like a role model
so I think we we should maybe put
together some kind of a petition or a
push to get this teacher on the cover of
Sports Illustrated so that we can show
the world
that unlike some people who are
close-minded we're not like that
we're not we are open-minded
and we like people who Express their
individuality and if this teacher wants
to identify as female I'm all for it and
let us let us celebrate it celebrate it
really
all right
uh so this big storm heading toward
Florida
um
I like states that I can live in year
round
laughs
that's my problem with Florida
you can move into Florida but sooner or
later somebody's going to tap you on the
shoulder and say
no you really need to get out of the
state the next day you better pack your
car get the get the pets you better get
out of the state I don't like that
California
all the California emergencies you could
usually stay in your house
yeah we have lots of smoke
but I stay in my house
earthquakes no problem
um very earthquake proof and I did not
build on a fault line
planned that ahead
so yeah I built my house to be uh extra
um
extra safe
so it's almost impossible for my house
to even catch on fire I know I'm
probably jinxing myself
but it's built to say oh God
damn it sorry
we've got a problem with my locals feed
today because I had a little Hardware
problem
I'm using my phone and it's timing out
now and then all right
um anyway I'm just teasing Florida
Florida is the greatest state but I
should note that you got you're not
going to beat my weather
all right I I will acknowledge to you
that Florida is a well-managed
state
I'll give you that
lots of advantages in Florida but you're
not going to beat my weather
you're not going to beat my weather
sorry
all right well
today the Dilbert comic came out and I
want to read it to you and what you're
gonna do what you're going to discover
is it's it's not funny
and you might ask yourself why is this
not funny this time
now some of you the NPCs go ahead what
did the NPCs say
please NPCs would you like I'll give you
your own time
the NPC say
well it was never funny Garfield
right are you are you done with that are
we good have you said the thing that you
have to say
and you can't you can't prevent it you
have to say it okay now you've said it
now there's a story to this so I'm gonna
I'm gonna read to you the Dilbert comic
you're going to see it's not funny and
then I'm going to tell you what it
originally was
before I was asked to change it
okay the only place you can see the
original is on the locals platform
anyway uh Dilbert and uh Dilbert and the
boss are looking out the window and the
boss says a protest is forming outside
her headquarters because we designed our
Ro our new robot to be too handsome
husbands are uncomfortable leaving them
home with their wives
and dilber says what now
and the boss says marketing thinks we
need to make them look like total losers
how do we do that
um and boss says they suggested making
it look and talk exactly like you
meeting Gilbert and Gilbert says
marketing said that
and the boss says I might have primed
the pump and then one month later dilber
says how are sales and the boss says
still zero
now
it's sort of a joke
but he's a little flat isn't it feels
like it's definitely missing something
isn't it
well that's because I was on deadline
and when my editor talked me out of
publishing this the the one that I'm
going to read to you in a moment
I didn't have time to change the art
so I actually rewrote the words
in an existing comic
so it didn't exactly work but I had to
have to hit deadline so here's here's
the first draft
and I'll tell you what it originally
said are you ready for this
here's what it originally said
the boss says our protest is forming
outside her headquarters because we
designed our new robot to be an
attractive female
people are saying we're sexist for
making us slim they want us to plump it
up
dilber says how plump
and the boss says marketing thinks
something on the low end of obesity is
The Sweet Spot
and Dilbert says okay anything else and
then the boss says the robots also need
to complain a lot so husbands won't fall
in love with them and Dilbert says
marketing said that and the boss says no
that's common sense
one month later
how are sales still zero
better
right that was better
now let me tell you the real story about
this one
all right the story is
uh
is it so I have an editor that works for
the syndication company that sends it
down to newspapers
so the first editor I have to get
through is my own editor the one that
works with me
after that it has to get through the
newspapers editors also so there are two
places that can be stopped
my editor is on my side
so I was on the Creator side so when my
editor says I don't think you should do
that that's for my benefit
and in this case I took his advice
and his advice was based on not there
was anything wrong with this comic you
know relative to other comics
it would have caused trouble
but that wasn't the problem
the problem was that it was embedded
with a whole bunch of other Comics that
were also controversial in other words
in that two-week period there were too
many controversies from me
and you didn't want the editors to just
have you know controversy fatigue and
say you know these you don't want an
Editor to say you're just causing me too
much work everybody's complaining and
it's just too much work
so it was basically a workload
client management
decision it wasn't censorship per se but
just so you know
all right so that's what happened there
um
uh I would like to blow one person's
mind today
if you don't mind
if you would indulge me
I'm going to say something here that
doesn't mean anything to anybody
except one person
you ready
baked turbo Flash
baked turbo flash that's it
moving on
somebody's mind just got blown cleared
off
well the FBI robbed a bank
what
what
yes
apparently the FBI got a warrant to go
into a bunch of safe deposit boxes in a
in a high-end bank I think in LA
and emptied a lot of the boxes and took
their
just took it
photographed it you know allegedly kept
records but just took it all looked
through everything looked through
everybody's personal blowings opened all
the but they had a warrant
do you know what the Warren said
uh go open all these boxes
I'm exaggerating but it was like a
general warrant allegedly they were
looking for illegal
um Criminal
assets
but I don't think they only opened the
boxes of illegal criminals
it looks like they just robbed the bank
if your warrant is fake so the warrant
we know now that the warrant was
fraudulent
so it was either you know fraudulent
might be too strong it was uh let's say
inappropriate or you know against
regulations or didn't follow guidelines
or something like that but anyway it was
an inappropriate warrant
clearly in the plural appropriate it
wasn't like a gray area it was very
inappropriate
and they went in and they took a bunch
of people's possessions
that's robbing the bank isn't it
if you go in under illegal fraudulent
means and take other people's assets out
of a bank and don't give them back
didn't you rob a bank
am I over interpreting that I mean it's
not a normal bank robbery but they did
literally fraudulently robbed a bank
and do you know why you're not more
upset about that
because there are too many outrages
we we have outrage fatigue
the FBI robbed a bank and you just
looked at it and go
that's sort of Baseline now like you
don't even expect the FBI not to rob a
bank
if the FBI murdered somebody at this
point you'd be like
not ideal
but what's for lunch
sounds like this sounds like a normal
day
well
so yeah
um
this is just amazing how could the FBI
be less credible at this point
to the public
well
so the same thing that is keeping us
from being outraged about this bank
robbery because there's just too much
outrage going on
um
I've decided to use that same technique
to my advantage
you've heard of that UDA Loop
you know the UDA Loop if you're in a
battle if you get the other if you get
your opponent continuously reacting
then they can never mount an offense
because they're just reacting all the
time they're just overwhelmed with
reacting to whatever you're doing so if
you can get them in that ooda Loop where
they're just reacting and you basically
own them
right away
now you may have noticed I've done some
provocative tweets and Comics lately
anybody notice
have you noticed I've turned up the
temperature
and here's why I haven't been canceled
yet I think
because I did too much of it so right
now people are mad at me for uh you know
several different tweets on different
areas several different comics in
different areas you know a whole bunch
of different things I've said in the
past
all kinds of stuff I don't think people
can get like a good beat on me because
they're so outraged about so many things
it's it's hard to really
like you know really grab onto one so
I'm basically doing the the Trump method
where I'm going to outrage you in a way
that would normally get me canceled but
before you can even react I'm going to
give you two more
I'm going to so outrage you and let me
tell you what I did today
that I could probably only do
inside my own UDA loop protection scheme
you ready for this this is something I
tweeted today
that has not gotten me canceled yet
and it was a response to Lamont Thompson
who's a an actor
and
he was commenting on my comments to Ida
Bay Wells on the question of whether
um it's about racism and employment and
I noted that I had been lost some jobs
for being a white male now Ida Bay Wells
said I was lying
you know directly said you are lying in
public
I'm lying why would I lie about that
I mean I suppose people will lie about
anything but it would be a weird kind of
a lie no it was a lie
um but anyway Lamont got in there and he
said he said something blah blah blah
and here's the part that caught me you
said about me you said the problem Scott
has is common
he and his ilk
my ilk
I think it's impossible to be mediocre
undesirable or viewed as just not very
good at what they do
and what he's saying is my ilk are white
men
so he's saying that white men
think that they're being discriminated
against and and that other people are
getting favoritism but possibly the real
problem here
as Lamont points out is that maybe
people like me specifically me
we don't realize how mediocre we are
so
let me first give you a little bit of a
response to that and then I'll tell you
the tweet I sent later so this is not a
tweet this is just my response to you
Okay so
let me give you just a little bit of a
context for the the time that I lost my
job
right so the question is did I lose a
job to somebody who has more qualified
and I just
fail to admit it
it's possible right that would be a
fairly reasonable
I mean it must happen somewhere that
surely there are white people
complaining about losing jobs when
really the problem was they were not
qualified
that clearly exists
but Lamont thinks I might be one of
these people
so I'll give them a little context
so
um
so I'll describe me and then I'll
describe the person I was competing
against at the bank the first job
all right so here's me all right so I
graduated high school as a valedictorian
and got an economics degree and I was
working on an MBA from a top school
if you're in a bank
if you're in a bank and you've got an
economics degree
and you're working on your MBA from the
top school that's everything they want
like I had the ideal Banker's resume
and I had the highest performance review
so valedictorian economics degree MBA
and the highest performance review
working in a bank
okay now the person I was competing
against had some strengths too and I'll
get to that so I don't want to leave a
suggestion that I had some
accomplishments and the person that I
competed at didn't
because I did so I'll get to that
um I did manage to become the most
influential cartoonist in the world but
as Lamont would point out you know big
deal your your successful cartoonist
um
I am considered a management expert
partly because the the Dilbert stuff so
yes
I dominate my industry
and I dominate you somebody else's
industry which is management
but that's just two things
um
I did write the most uh influential
self-help book of all time creative
systems versus goals Talent Stacks uh
I did cure thousands of people of health
issues
and
I have dominated uh Politics the best
predictions in the pandemic best
predictions on Military in the Ukraine
and uh wrote The Definitive personal
finance guide
um and they've changed changed a lot of
policies in the United States
so that's all I've done
but like I said the person I competed
against also had some accomplishments
for example
she graduated high school
so as Le Mans says it's hard to know
who was more qualified
I don't know this is a tough one Lamont
I know could be the one with all the
advanced degrees and
who has succeeded and dominated five
separate fields
could be that one or we could be the one
with the high school high school diploma
who is also very good by the way by the
way there was nothing wrong with her she
was a good manager
quite qualified
so it is possible
that I was unaware that I wasn't quite
as qualified as the other applicant
um
never know but here's what I did
I tweeted today that uh
if you're a white man in America
you're odd well if you're a black man
your odds of employment are five times
better than a white man in America
how many of you would agree or disagree
with that statement that as of today
the a black man let's say equal
qualifications
black man and a white man in America
equal qualifications I think that the
black man has Pros approximately five
times advantage over the white man would
that sound about right about five times
yeah now
let me uh let me talk to the NPCs
what what do the NPCs say now what's the
NPC say what's the most obvious thing
you say that doesn't help
yeah well you'll you'll think of it
but do you think that I could have
tweeted
except for being having caused so much
other trouble recently do you think that
I could have gotten away with treat with
tweeting directly
that a black man in America has five
times the employment opportunity as a
white man
I got no pushback
I got no pushback you should see the
tweet
I don't know if I could have done that a
year ago
I think a year ago I mean it would just
been the biggest problem but I've caused
so many other problems this week nobody
knows what to attack me for my ooda
lupus is is intact
so got that going for me and I put that
out there and by the way Ada Bay Wells
just sort of crept away after
you know after we dunk on her because
she's so wrong
and imagine what a mind it is to be
a black person in the United States to
realize for the first time
imagine this imagine what this would do
to your head
you you've lived and you grew up in
America and you have this certain set of
beliefs and you found out today
that you've always had a five times
advantage over white men in employment
you always did it's never been different
my entire life
and if if you want to find out if I'm
you know exaggerating or kidding
walk out of the sideway walk and and
this is an actual experiment I want you
to actually do this if you're black and
you're wondering is this true because
you should be
if I were black and I heard this for the
first time today I'd be thinking well
there's no way that's true
no it is true and if you'd like to
validate it walk out in the sidewalk and
just tap on the shoulder any middle-aged
white guy
anybody anyone
and just say are you aware of any
discrimination against white males and
employment
and watch how many stories you get
it's everybody everybody everywhere now
the question that if you're black here's
the first question you should ask
how is it possible
how is it possible
that I would just be hearing about this
now
right and that's a good question how
could this be true if I'm just hearing
it now let me explain that to you
no white man in the world is dumb enough
to say this out loud
except me and the only reason I can't is
because you
 you that's all I I can say anything
I want because you
I've just decided I can say anything I
want now
because I'm close enough to retirement I
paid my money and now I'm going to stop
lying I'm just going to stop lying
I've been lying for 30 years
black men and black women especially
have a huge advantage over white people
in employment in America and education
it's not even close it's like a
five-time disorder difference if you
come in here and say you know Scott I
hear your argument there there might be
like a little bit of difference you know
maybe maybe a little Advantage for the
the black people no
I'm not saying that
I'm saying this is a five times
Advantage I'm saying we're not in the
same zip code
now to be fair
are the white people really
disadvantaged
well I mean you could make an argument
that they just go get a job somewhere
else
because that's usually what happens but
it's still discrimination
luckily we live in a country where labor
is in great demand
if labor
it had been constrained this would be a
big problem
but let me tell you how white people
think
okay this isn't the hill I'm going to
die on I'm just going to go get another
job
because what happens if a white person
sues
so this is the other dumb question that
black people ask
right and let me say this just as
clearly as I can this is a dumb
question that black people ask
there are a lot of dumb questions that
white people ask
ask black people right all the time so
we can ask each other dumb questions or
say dumb things that's okay all right
the dumbest thing the black people ask
when they hear about this they say well
why didn't you sue
every white man right now is just
laughing
we all know why we didn't sue
because we're white men
we're white men
we don't Sue over
I mean we would sue if it was big enough
and if we couldn't get a job somewhere
else and if we didn't take
responsibility for our own lives if we
blame somebody else for every
problem we had we could do that
sure and then we'd never get a job again
you'd never get a job again
would you hire somebody who had sued
their last employer I wouldn't
I wouldn't
would you if you knew somebody had sued
their last employer and won even if they
were right would you hire them no no
because even if they were right
you don't want the litigant you don't
want the litigious person
it doesn't matter if they're a white or
black or the most qualified person
you've ever seen in your life you're not
going to hire the person who sues their
employer
even a different employer no way
but also white men are not taught
to complain in this way
we're taught to just get on with it so
suck it up
figure it out
go make something work
all right
and here's the funny thing it's almost
like the country is ready for this
message
because I'm not getting any pushback
I I just said the most insanely
provocative thing you could say in
public I don't even think the Press will
pick it up they should
I'll say it again
a black man in America has a five times
better Advantage getting a job similarly
qualified
as a white man
I'll go further a less qualified black
man is almost certainly going to get the
job over a more qualified white man
in most cases the exception would be
where you really need a specific skill
and there's just no way around it but in
most cases the less qualified black man
will be hired
three times out of four probably
now to be fair
and allow me to let me soften that
because I'm trying to be I'm trying to
be honest
not
um not a protagonist for one side
is also true
see if you disagree with the statement
hiring managers aren't really good at
knowing who will do the job better
so even if you think you know who's the
better qualified one yeah don't always
right you don't always
when I told you my story about the high
school graduate who got the job that I
thought I should have gotten
and I was told directly because I'm
white male I can't have that job
as far as I know she did a great job I
have no reason to think that she didn't
perform perfectly
right but those are not the rules that
we thought we were playing on I
developed I developed a set of
qualifications because those were the
rules I thought I was playing
get these qualifications and you'll be
at the top of the list for the job
so I went and got them
all right so it feels a little unfair
but
did I mention I'm a white man
what I what do I do when something's
unfair to me
 suck it up that's what I do I
just get over it just move on with it
you know get on with life make something
work yeah stop stop failing and do
something that works
all right
all right let's talk about the uh
uh re-ups
so this is a point I made before but uh
that was before a member of Congress uh
retweeted it
so so it's
I guess it's prominence just went up a
notch
so this is something uh Thomas Massey
retweeted this morning
um I tweeted that the FBI and the
January 6 committee have signaled by
Omission FBI involvement in January 6
incitement
so that becomes the Public's working
assumption
keyword keywords working assumption if
the FBI wants to change our working
assumptions on Epps nothing's stopping
them
I'll change my mind in fact in fact it
would be really easy for me to change my
mind
with just some information I mean I
don't even think it would be hard
all you have to say is yeah I mean even
this you could say okay yeah he did work
for the FBI but you know we looked into
it and you know that's not what he was
doing that day I could be convinced but
if you're not going to try to convince
me you're not going to attempt it and
you say let's yeah we'll just ignore
this whole thing
if you're gonna ignore it
I will treat that as a confirmation and
it will be my working assumption that
you've confessed
doesn't mean it's true so I'm not going
to accept it as true but remember we
live in a world where you have to make a
choice
you don't get to do nothing well I guess
doing nothing is a choice but you have
to choose
and so if you're going to act on your
beliefs the belief you should act on
is
um Epps being part of a FBI incitement
operation
for which I have no evidence of
I have no evidence to to say that that
would happen I'm just saying that it's
the
as a citizen and a responsible adult
you should look at this and say oh we
asked a direct question they failed to
deny it we can treat that like it's true
if they want to change our mind
we're here
FBI knows where to find the country
just put in a statement
say here's what I would be happy with
let me let me give you an example
I don't personally need to know
everything about rayups
because maybe there's some confidential
stuff there and he's he's a citizen
right he's got the right to some privacy
but
if you told me and I'll just pick a name
if you told me that Rand Paul
had sat with him and talked to him
personally and maybe he talked to other
people and looked into it and that Rand
Paul
knew all the secrets whatever the FBI
knows he knows and then Rand Paul came
out and said okay I can't tell you what
they told me
because it's confidential but trust me
you don't need to worry about this this
I made this go away
I'd be good with that wouldn't you now
there's always some small chance that
you know Rand Paul would be lying to you
but there's no history to suggest that
would happen right he's one of the
greatest shooters
in the country
so yeah you say trust no one I get that
I get that trust no one's not crazy
that's not crazy but I'm saying that as
a reasonable best you can do if somebody
we trusted
told us we looked into it I think I'd be
inclined to go with that I'd go with
that
but if they don't do anything given how
easy it would be to convince us to stop
talking about it
either they either want us to talk about
it to you know make Republicans look
extra crazy which would be a good plot
by the way or there's something to it
all right
um here's another thing I was doing just
to want the by the way the ray up stuff
that's part of my ooda Loop
I don't care that much about it rayups I
just wanted to do one more provocative
thing so that all my provocations are
are rising about the same time
my other provocation was this I tweeted
this I'm seeing how how far how close I
can fly to the Sun
in terms of election integrity
without saying anything that's untrue
all right so I tweeted this uh
I'm not aware of any proof proof that
our election systems are rigged or even
could be
in any of our 50 states
and that is remarkable given that 100 of
everything else we can't directly
observe is rigged huh
uh and then I I added also unarmed
protesters tried to conquer the United
States
now I believe what I said is actually
the official word right didn't I just
agree with the official narrative the
official narrative is that there is no
proof of election systems being rigged I
agree I have seen no proof of that
or even that they could be
and also I've seen no proof of it in any
of the 50 separate systems that are
managed by each state which is
remarkable
given that the FBI is robbing banks
Congress is doing insider trading and
basically a hundred percent of the
systems that we can't view directly are
corrupt
except all 50 state election systems
the only exceptions and you'd think it
would be amazing to have one exception
like one state that wasn't corrupted
that would be amazing if even one
but we got 50. 50.
2000 mules is not proof and if you still
think so you need to catch up
two thousand mules is a
a red flag it's a signal it's an
invitation to look further but that's
all it is
that nobody has looked and found
anything
in my opinion
yeah I do care about ray-ups in the
sense that anything that would free the
prisoners would be good so yes I'll
agree with you on that
um so here and then I said the unarmed
protesters tried to conquer the United
States
well that's the official narrative right
is that unarmed protesters tried to
conquer the United States now the fact
that that seems absurd and ridiculous
when you read it isn't my fault
it's not my fault
I'm just describing it if it sounds
ridiculous to you well that's between
you and the news
don't blame me I'm just giving you the
facts
uh so there's also a story about China
have you ever seen a
picture of a chairman she next to a
picture and a picture of Beavis
like Beavis and bye
have you ever seen them together
I I put a picture of the two of them
together on Twitter today all I see is
Beavis
German she looks just like Beavis
he's got that that oh the look oh
I don't want to do that that sounds
racist but Beavis has you know weird
shaped eyes
so if you take the racist part out of it
he reminds me of uh she
all right
um so people have been saying hey
there's something going on over there
and maybe it's a coup
uh there was there were oh me
bad technology
there we go
oops
all right we're back on back online
back online
all right so I think the uh the dream of
a China coup is probably fake but here
here's something that apparently the
Chinese do this as a regular pattern
before they have their big what what's
the name of it the communist
committee meeting that they do
what's that called
some kind of a big CCP meeting that they
do anyway so they think that she will
try to get uh Emperor for life or
something like that out of that but
apparently what they do just before this
big event is they they put in jail uh
major political people
so they put them in jail on a regular
basis like that's just a regular thing
so they just jailed some minister in the
Chinese government for stealing 90
million dollars or something
and here's the question
I wonder if all the ministers in the
Chinese government are stealing 90
million dollars
because I always assumed they were
isn't that the whole point of being the
you know being toward the top in a
communist country is you get to steal
millions of dollars I just assume
they're all doing that so I wonder if
the people that they decide to prosecute
are just the ones that are not
politically you know on this on the
right team they're not trying hard
enough to support the leader
but anyway
um
I don't think you have to
worry too much about a coup
don't think that's happening
um apparently Twitter and Facebook
suspended numerous fake accounts
for spreading disinformation
now that doesn't sound unusual right
because they routinely get rid of fake
accounts that are spreading
disinformation let's see who who owned
these accounts of the U.S government
yes it turns out that the U.S government
is creating fake Twitter and Facebook
accounts to spread misinformation
and that's confirmed
now
I think the story was telling us that
they were spreading fake information
in the international markets it was a
little unspecific about whether it's
spreading that same misinformation to
our markets but of course they are
they're all connected
you you can't tell a fake rumor in some
other Market not expect it to get over
here
right so now we know that our our
government is literally lying to us
and other countries
and for sure so they robbed the bank
they're putting uh political opponents
in jail
and they're using propaganda and
spreading fake information
so that's your that's your U.S
government right there pretty good huh
all right I decided to come up with a
solution for Taiwan
you've been waiting for this haven't you
I know a lot of you every day like Scott
where's your solution for Taiwan
you solved so many other problems
well I have a solution for Taiwan
you ready for it
and it depends on the following thing
it depends on China being as dumb as the
people who responded to me on Twitter
and I think I can count on that being
true
all right now I'm going to I'm going to
set an NPC trap for you
I'm telling you in advance this is an
NPC trap I'm going to trap you into
saying the most obvious thing about this
topic
and then I'm going to tell you that
that's what I'm making the Chinese thing
to
and you fell for it and it's not it's
nonsense right so here's my idea and
then watch for somebody to say the most
obvious thing
and that's my trick
so here's the idea Taiwan should
announce that uh they're they've decided
to merge with China
so Taiwan should say it first we've
decided to merge with China become one
country
here's how we're going to do it
we're going to become one country in
spirit right away
so that we'll say all Chinese people We
Are One
but we'll wait 100 years 100 years and
then we will merge systems
but not for 100 years and then we'll see
what makes sense for a system because
everything will change in 100 years and
then we'll implement the one that makes
sense in a hundred years
go
NPC is way in
word there we go
first NPC in Hong Kong yes that is the
NPC trick I was trying to get you to say
because you just said to yourself Scott
didn't work in Hong Kong did it
the Chinese just waited and then they
just took over Hong Kong how about that
that's exactly what you're supposed to
think
because everybody who thinks that
analogies
predict
nope
what you want is that China will
incorrectly predict
just like you did
so you said my analogy is Hong Kong Hong
Kong didn't work this is like Hong Kong
this won't work
that's what I want China to think
and I can even say it out loud and
they'll still think it
but here's the trick what's different
this time
well analogies are always there's always
differences in the analogies here's the
big difference
in a hundred years
nothing's predictable
the odds that China will even exist as a
state like you know it are really not
that high in 100 years because in 100
years we're going to be past the
singularity
where computers are intelligent AI will
have changed everything
right technology will have changed
everything
it's perfectly possible than 100 years
mainland China will say you know this
Taiwan system worked better than ours
let's do that
now what happens if a hundred years goes
by and Taiwan is bristling with
self-defensive weapons
because it could be it would just keep
going on as it has gone before
there's just the same odds of China
attacking except you bought yourself a
hundred years
so if you could buy yourself a hundred
years of China not attacking Taiwan
wouldn't you take it
at the end of 100 years everything's
going to be just a jump ball
now would they have said the same thing
about Hong Kong
a hundred years before Hong Kong
transferred
would would people have said the same
hey everything's going to be different
let's say 100 years no because things
did not change quickly
as quickly as they change now so the
rate of change for hundreds of years was
you know there's definitely change
but you could kind of you could a little
bit more straight line the change and
say all right Hong Kong's still going to
look like Hong Kong the buildings will
be better
Hong Kong will still have streets but
instead of horses maybe there are cars
right but basically you could straight
line that one for a hundred years
there's nothing you can straight line
for 100 years now nothing
there's nothing that can be straight
lined for 100 years so if you say we'll
give you our country in 100 years what
have you promised
nothing
the odds that both of them will both be
countries
are actually low
I mean there's something will happen
long before that climate change or mass
immigration or somebody's going to Nuke
you know nuke somebody or a World War
III or aliens will invade or the AI will
change everything robots will be running
everything maybe we've decoupled from
China there won't be anything that's the
same what about weapons
at the moment Taiwan has so many weapons
it almost looks like they could hold off
China
what kind of weapons are they going to
have in 100 years
in a hundred years everybody will have
mutually assured destruction
in 100 years Taiwan will be able to
destroy all of China
as quickly as China can can destroy all
of Taiwan there won't even be a
difference in a hundred years
right now
did I sell anybody
it's not bad is it
it's not bad
it's not bad now keep in mind that
nobody else has an idea am I right
is it true that literally no one has an
idea
and if we continue with just nobody has
an idea
my prediction is that China will take
over Taiwan
do you know why
because this is China
and this little dingleberry hanging off
the end is Taiwan and I'm sorry
your real estate is just important
there's just no way that the situation
lasts forever
but
in a hundred years
old bets are off
Cuba we've never tried to Annex Cuba
all right so that's a bad example
all right well I was surprised that I
did I sell that better than I thought I
would because I'm looking for some
pushback here I'm not really getting it
and and maybe it just has to do with the
fact that literally there's no other
idea
now I told you my idea of
attacking Mexico and occupying it and
using a base there to destroy the
um the cartels for as long as it takes
permanent doesn't matter
all right
now do you remember how radical that
sounded the first time you heard it
and do you notice how it doesn't sound
as radical anymore
I'm doing that I'm doing that to you I'm
making you get used to it because the
and the persuasion principles that you
can get used to anything so no matter
how Radical Something sounds the first
time you hear it if you just keep
hearing it it becomes less radical
so I'm just going to make sure that
people keep hearing it
and it will become less radical
I'll even go further
a military attack by the United States
on Mexico is not optional
only the timing is
the only thing that's optional is the
timing we're definitely going to invade
Mexico
there's no way around it because just
because the danger coming through is
just too great there's no way we don't
do it sometime in the next 20 years
for sure
so I might as well get it over with do
it while it's easy
um
let's see what else is going on
Glenn Greenwald had a tweet today as
often he does that just sort of captures
everything he says I can't stress this
enough at its Core Democratic politics
is about criminalizing opposition to
their party and ideology
dissenting ideas are disinformation and
must be censored by big Tech
and that Dr and that Trump voters are
inherently Criminal
insurrectionists and should be
imprisoned
I think this is exactly right
you know I'm you you know I never jump
on the you know globalists
conspiracy theories and stuff like that
I'm not I'm not into the conspiracy
theory too much uh
I I just have to there was there was a
comedian I was just watching on a reel
and I wish I remembered his name maybe
somebody knows him uh not one of the
well-known comedians but he was a black
man could be a comedian so anybody
recognized and here was his joke and
I'll paraphrase it
and he goes uh
I wish I could do a better job his is
better he goes you know a lot of you
believe in uh conspiracy theories and
some of you think that uh all the
conspiracy theories are are false
he says really
the government
you think the government has a
thousand percent is batting a thousand
in conspiracy theories
none of them are true and when he when
he says it that way really your
government is is batting a thousand
every single conspiracy theory not true
and it's just what he says it like that
I just laughed for like 10 minutes okay
when you put it that way
yeah there must be some of them that are
true
but
this isn't a conspiracy theory this is
more about describing the frame that
they see things and I've I've described
it as shooting the messenger
you know the Republicans think Democrats
have bad plans
and Democrats think Republicans are bad
people
and I think Glenn Greenwald captured
this perfectly that they're trying to
criminalize the other side
and it's everywhere so if it were one
thing you say well that's just that one
thing but they do seem to be
criminalizing in and censoring in every
way they can the other side so I think
politics now is about
shutting up the other side
more than voting and whatnot
um
foreign
how many of you think there's going to
be a Civil War in the United States
spoiler there's not going to be
there won't be
that there's an obvious reason for it
somebody said it on Twitter
and I guess I guess I realized it but
until I heard somebody say it directly
we're too mixed
we're too mixed households have
Democrats and Republicans in them
households there's no there's no way you
can
it just wouldn't work
yeah there's no way
and here's the other thing all of this
political bickering
is largely
um theater
it's 90 theater
so when people especially Republicans
when they talk about getting their guns
and you know overthrowing the government
if the government raises their taxes or
whatever they're talking about it's just
stuff you talk about because it's fun to
talk about and act tough but it's not
real if you think it's real you're
you're on a whole different planet than
I am yeah it's a show it's just part of
the show and part of talking about
politics very connected with Paul
talking about it is a lot of people like
to essentially inhabit a character
and say I'm talking about it and I'm
living in it but I'll play this
character who's really tough and is
going to shoot anybody who gets in the
way and stuff like that
so no we're not going to have a civil
war we're not we're nowhere close we're
not going to divide up our states
you know why we won't divide up the
states
because it would make us all weaker
and no American is going to say oh let's
take our national strength and divide it
in half
if you divide our strength in half then
China wins
there's no way it's more likely that we
would Annex another country than divide
let me put it this way there's a greater
chance will Annex Mexico than have a
civil war and I don't think either one's
going to happen
but there's a greater chance we would
Annex Mexico
all right
somebody on Twitter actually said this
to me
that belief in the merit-based system is
you know basically you're a piece of
if you believe in and that we should
have a merit-based system
and basically that's just cruel and
awful and
fascist
merit-based system
and I thought to myself oh you know
it is a cruel system
and it is unfair a merit-based system is
really unfair
you get that right
ameribace the system is super unfair
why
well apparently some people are born
with whatever capability they need to
succeed whatever Drive they need and
others are not
I mean most of your performances you
know you were born with whatever
capability probably at least 60 percent
of it maybe more 80 percent
and
so a mirror based system is always going
to be unfair
it is however the only one that works
so what option do you have
oh let's use the one that's fair well
that one doesn't work
like it'll the whole everything will
fall apart we'll all die
yeah but it's fair yeah
fair is good if we could get fair for
free I'd want some
but no
I'd rather have a system that works
that's unfair to somebody sometimes
that's the best you can do the best you
can do is an unfair system that works
most of the time that's it that's all
you got
all right let me tell you
um let's talk about uh Russia
so I'm getting mixed reports about what
the mood is in Russia the actual Russian
people
some are suggesting that this new
mobilization and movement of troops is
touching enough families that there's
going to be some internal dissent and
you see some people seem they're leaving
the country I don't think in big numbers
yet but some people are leaving the
country
um
and so some speculate that Putin's in
trouble because his population will see
all these people being mobilized you
can't miss them there's so many of them
and then it will get the public involved
in a bad way
um
but I talked I've talked to uh
some folks
and one was a Russian citizen with
parents in Russia and I told you I got
the
um one person's opinion that the older
generation is pro-putin because he's
been brainwashing them for decades
and that the younger generation is a
little more you know open to any kind of
change but they always are right so I
think that's the situation I think the
older people are actually solidly on
Putin's side at the moment I don't think
Russian
um
Russian citizens look like they're ready
to revolt
now let's talk about Iran so Iran's
having these big protests I don't think
they're going to go anywhere
could be surprised but it doesn't look
like it's going to grow outside of its
you know cultural part of the revolution
and so I don't think China is going to
have a revolution Iran's gonna have a
revolution or Russia but we like talking
about it
all right I figured out why uh we can't
do anything about Fentanyl
and we're going to go to the Whiteboard
um and I don't know if this is fixable
I I thought that like if everybody got
informed and
you know we could find some way to move
forward but there's there is a real
roadblock here that I did not anticipate
and I'll show you and it's psychological
but I don't know any way around it
so here the the fentanyl Illusions as
long as these Illusions
um
control the public
they can't act
and and nothing's gonna and nothing's
going to change that
so right now people believe that demand
can be reduced
that you don't need to have to go after
the suppliers of fentanyl because if you
did the supply would just move somewhere
else
right if you took out the mat the
Chinese suppliers it's already being
moved to India so India is actually
picking up the the fentanyl precursor
business
and if you stopped it in India
we'll go somewhere else right so there
is that argument now
so people say well if you can't stop it
at the supply side it's really
impossible at least you can get people
to do less of it and create the demand
how many of you agree with the statement
the demand for fentanyl could be reduced
if we did if we did the right thing
how many think that
right it's an illusion
right everybody who's had an addict in
the family knows there is nothing you
can do
people believe there's a program
like there's a program although take you
out of your you know you could have your
teen removed from your house like
forcibly and and then they work hard on
some dude ranch until they're good
people
no that doesn't exist that literally
doesn't exist but everybody I talked to
has heard of somebody who's been in that
program
that doesn't exist
there are even people who are naming the
program the program you're naming is not
available
not in California anyway you can't you
can't you can't kidnap somebody out of
their bed in California I don't know
about your state but most not most a
hundred percent of the things you think
work
don't work
and it's known not to work right so do
you think that you can put somebody in
rehab
and cure their addiction how many people
think rehab will cure people's addiction
I don't think any experts like it
they think that people who have decided
to quit can quit
that's it
so you take somebody who has decided to
quit and you put them in any kind of
program and they'll probably do okay
because they've decided to quit you take
somebody who has not decided to quit and
there's nothing you can do
there's nothing you can do you can't
force them
and they're you can't persuade them
there's nothing absolutely nothing and
nobody nobody even has a suggestion by
the way
now some of you can say but but but you
know I heard about ketamine
great if you're a parent good luck
putting your kid on a ketamine treatment
that's not gonna happen
that's not gonna happen anywhere like
you could do something illegal sure but
not really there's just nothing you can
do all right so you have to lose the
illusion that you can work on the demand
side
now you might say to me Scott you need
to lose the illusion
um and let me explain this in a more
direct way
if I were trying to convince you of
something
I would talk to your brain right I I
would say things that would go into your
ears it'll become part of your thinking
and they may or may not persuade you
that's the normal way you persuade
something
addicts don't have a brain
addicts have addiction
addiction becomes the brain
and so the illusion is that the addict
is somebody who has a brain plus an
addiction on top
conceptually yes
but in a practical sense no there's no
brain there
here's me uh negotiating with an addict
you should get some treatment
what no response
fentanyl will kill you
I don't know why this isn't working
this this thing is not going into rehab
I don't know why not
is it not using his free will
there is fentanyl in the products you're
using that you don't know so you could
be killed
what is wrong why oh
why is it not getting in rehab why is it
still buying Fentanyl
because it doesn't have a brain
you can't talk to this I can't convince
us to do anything if you believe you can
talk to an addict
and reason with them
I'm sorry
no you've never met an addict if you
think that
so no you can't do anything to reduce
demand you can't reason with them you
can't do anything
what about that Portugal experiment
where they legalized drugs and they
tried to help them with treatment and
stuff like that
that didn't work
it didn't work
sorry didn't work
if you want to know just just uh just
Google Portugal drug experience
just look for yourself
it had quote mixed experience do you
know why that Portugal experience hasn't
been spread to everywhere
because it didn't work
Right add mixed results now the mixed
results they say they got more people
into rehab
is that good
if you got more people into rehab are
you ahead
no do you know why
because the only people in rehab that
are going to get better are the ones
that decided to
if you double the number of people in
there but the number who have decided to
get better is exactly the same because
they're the ones who went themselves you
get the same result
you triple it same result
they're only good three people three
people get better
now let's do it times a hundred times
more into rehab still just three get
better because they were the three who
had decided
right so a lot of this stuff that looks
like just common sense
you'd say obviously that works obviously
rehab Works nope
nope
no only for the people have decided
and you can't make somebody decide
you have no control there's no free will
none of that is involved with an addict
it's like you know you're talking to a
pencil
so addicts don't have free will they
don't have uh the the whole uh take
personal responsibility doesn't mean
anything
those words don't even mean anything to
an addict addict is just an addict they
just need a fix that's all
and uh
people think that uh
um addicts could just learn to do
something instead of fentanyl you know
still get high
you know but use heroin or something
that's not going to kill you as often
and the answer is no that can't be done
can't do that either because they don't
know they're getting fentanyl that's the
whole problem the ones who are buying
fentanyl directly which does happen
they don't die
as often
because they know what they're getting
so they make sure that they're you know
monitoring it and doing all the right
stuff the people who are dying are the
ones who thought they bought Pez they
got fentanyl right the kids
so the reason that fentanyl can't be
solved is that I can't even talk the
people that follow me into dropping
these illusions
right and and let me test it how many of
you believe that you could work on
demand
watch this
how many people still think that demand
is something you could reduce
so you're just being shy I know you
think that it works
I know some of you think it works right
but would you agree that this is our
problem
who who is gonna who's gonna approve of
attacking the cartels if they think that
the real the real answer is personal
responsibility I wouldn't
if I believe that personal
responsibility would work
or that rehab would work I would not be
in favor of attacking another country
that'd be crazy it's the last thing I'd
want to do
but I would do want to do it because
it's the last thing I want to do now to
the question of
would
the fentanyl production just go to
another place
here's the answer
why is it not already being made in the
United States
because it's hard
the only reason it's not being made in
the United States
is because it's hard to make it in the
United States for whatever reason
too easy to catch or I don't know too
hard to get the precursors in I'm not
sure
but
keep in mind and here's another
advantage of having an economics degree
would everybody who has business and
economics degrees who's watching
back me up on this
I don't know the economics of Fentanyl
but given its wildly profitable compared
to how much the ingredients cost
everybody's on board so far it's wildly
profitable
for a very small expense
suppose that making it in the United
States cost 20 times more
it would be everywhere in the United
States because 20 times more expense
wouldn't even matter
because 20 times more than that tiny
expense is still twine tiny
versus a huge prophet
if it were true that cutting off the
overseas sources of fentanyl made no
difference because we would just make it
in the United States it already would be
here
there would be no Chinese cartel
India
Fentanyl
if it were possible and practical to
make it in the United States
everybody with a business degree just
just agreed with me right because the
economics are just very clear
if you could make it in the United
States in your bathroom you would
already be doing it it would be hugely
profitable
there's some reason you don't I don't
know what it is
um
all right
so I don't know what to do about that
now here's a question for you
um have you ever wondered why we're not
refilling the national oil Reserves
does that bother you I understand the
part where we're taking oil out because
we have a you know short-term need
that's pretty important I mean you could
argue it's a national emergency but
is the reason we're not refilling it
because the cost of oil is too expensive
but wouldn't we be uh
uh well let me ask you this
so let's say you went to somebody who's
well is closed
for whatever reasons and you say to him
the only way you're going to sell this
oil is to the government at a good price
and under those conditions we'll let you
open up the well but otherwise we're
going to go green
so this well can't be opened
you don't think we could make an offer
the government you don't think the
government could find a producer
who would be willing to sell an entire
you know Reserve full of oil that's a
lot
that entire Reserve you don't think you
could get an American producer to give
you a super discount on that
I think you could because the cost of
producing didn't start didn't change
just the market value that you could
sell it for changed because they
wouldn't have a choice of selling it on
the open market if they did then of
course the price would be higher but if
you said the only way you can produce is
if you produce for the US government and
then you have to shut down again
I think you could find that easily so I
don't understand exactly
maybe we are actually maybe they are
filling it up but I don't know
as possible
um
let me tell you something about
globalist conspiracies
I hear stuff like the globalist I heard
one today that the globalists want
um poor people to stay poor
so they have lots of employees
that the rich people have lots of
employees
do you believe that
to me that sounds ridiculous
because you know robots will take over
anyway
uh
so let me tell you this so you've heard
lots of like conspiracy theories and
stuff but I've spent enough time behind
the curtain
like you know in the room with the
people actually know how things work
that I've never seen it
to me behind the curtain is a bunch of
uh individual interests fighting for
their own
for their own little fiefdom like
billionaires just looking out for
themselves basically
now I know some of you are like oh my
God how could you miss it
where is it
yeah I mean the whole thing is basically
uh Klaus Schwab quotes taken in a
context as far as I can tell
you know the the one that got most
people confused is you won't own
anything and you'll like it
that's the world
we're already in
I I don't own the Uber car
and I like it
I don't own the internet
but I like I can use it I don't own
the cable to my house but I'm glad I
could watch TV
you know the the whole fact that you
would be afraid of this you won't own it
but you'll like it
you see you're completely wrong about
that
it's just it's just the most ordinary
statement of how the economy is likely
to develop there's just nothing there
now I do think it's true that the people
who want to save the planet from climate
change according to them
I do think that they want to push
fossil fuels into failure
so that but that's not really a
conspiracy theory that's that's pretty
much on the surface isn't it
right I mean I wouldn't call that a
conspiracy because we can all see it
all right
um
you won't even own the AC in your car
uh yo you don't own the video games you
paid for you don't like it yeah
I don't know I'd rather rent anything
that needs to be upgraded
that's that's my take
um
and I'm pretty sure
I hit all of my
incredible incredible content
easily the best live stream you've ever
seen
all right anything I missed a story is a
big story is happening that
Evan yeah I look well prepared because I
I didn't sleep last night I just decided
to uh screw it I'll just get up
all right you're supposed to say what
tragic boating accident
uh Ivermectin I'm not going to talk
about Ivermectin oh God
yeah again people uh are sending me all
the bad studies about Ivermectin is
there anybody here who doesn't know why
meta
meta studies are not valid
meta-analysis you know what a
meta-analysis is you look at a bunch of
studies that are low quality
but then you say well if most of them
are still pointing in the same direction
maybe some of these errors sort of
cancel each other out
right but here's why it doesn't work two
two main reasons one is there could be
one big study that
um has too much impact so there might be
one you know with fifty thousand
participants and a whole bunch of little
ones with you know a hundred each
the big one is going to just overwhelm
the other ones but it you know there's
no reason it should it just would
uh the other thing is that
when you do a meta-analysis you really
don't include every study you do throw
throw away ones that you know are bad
which means it's subjective
so one person might throw away one study
another person doing the same analysis
would throw away another study so it's
not math it's just an opinion
so when the meta-analysis is done you
can shape it either direction by what
you put in or out for example you could
say the big study that's distorting
everything is either in
or is out and either one of those would
be valid as a meta-analysis except the
answers would be opposite
one would tell you do it one would tell
you don't do it and it's the same
analysis they're both a meta-analysis
and both of them would be reasonable
because it would be reasonable to take
it out and it would be reasonable to
keep it in
they're both reasonable but they'll give
you opposite answers because of math
right so when you're looking at the
Ivermectin studies you'll find that the
randomized controlled trials
are either you know poorly done or
whatever and and all they have is the
meta-analysis and the meta-analysis has
been debunked
uh Italian elections I'm not really
following them too much but there's
some right-wing candidates over there
I don't know if that's a trend or just
an Italian thing
the largest wholesale fresh produce
market in the world is on fire in Paris
