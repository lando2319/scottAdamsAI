hey everybody come on in
and welcome to and i don't like to brag
about this but i think it's
quite appropriate uh yes it's true i'm
the first
heterosexual bald man
to host coffee with scott adams
first one and my critics are saying that
it's stunning and brave i think it is
and it takes courage it takes courage to
do this
and if you'd like to enjoy it to its
fullest capacity all you need is a
copyright marker glass a tanker
challenger stein a candy jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee join me
now for the unparalleled pleasure that
dopamine the other day the thing that
makes
everything better
except the lockdown it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens
now go
well those of you worried about the
coming
demise of periscope worry not
you have options it looks like twitter
is going to just
incorporate periscope into twitter
so it's starting to look like twitter
isn't going away
so much as the name is changing and the
way you get into it is different
so we'll wait on that but in the
meantime
especially since i don't trust youtube
to not demonetize me or not
kick me off i've opened up a rumble
account
in addition to youtube now rumble uh
is almost ready to have live streaming
so until rumble has live streaming i'll
just continue to do the two live streams
and then as soon as these are done
they'll get posted to rumble
also to the locals platform if you want
to see it there
all right let's talk about all the stuff
chris christie just recorded a
commercial
public service announcement telling peop
people to wear masks
because he got the covent himself and he
was in the ico
icu for days and now he says
quote this message isn't for everyone
christy said in the video uh it's for
all those people who refuse to wear a
mask
you know lying in isolation in icu for
seven days
i thought about how wrong i was to
remove my mask
at the white house well i suppose it
depends what he means by that
if he means he thinks he got the virus
because he removed his mask
i'm not sure that's what the masks are
for has that changed
because i thought we were told very
clearly
and often that wearing a mask is for the
benefit of the other person
it's not so much that you're going to
prevent things coming into you
but you might prevent giving off some
virus to somebody else has that changed
did so did i i saw a comment that says
the cdc changed that
but i didn't see that in the news so i
don't know but if it did change or it
didn't
there's so many things that are just
sketchier
but it would be weird if christy went
from
whatever he believed about masks to his
current belief about masks
and still didn't know it's about the
other person somebody says it can help
but
i would have to think it would help in
both directions maybe more so in one
direction
well today is the anniversary back in
1903 the wright brothers
flew their first airplane
and whenever i see a story about the
wright brothers
i think back to all of my critics who
say
scott scott's got stay in your lane
don't don't try to go into some other
field
that's not gonna work you're a
cartoonist
cartoonist draw cartoons cartoon boy
don't you get out of that lane but of
course i call that
the most loser-ish advice of all advice
in the history of time stay in your lane
would have not given you the airplane
stay in your lane would not give you the
automobile
stay in your lane would not get you
[Music]
apple computer what did steve jobs know
about
computers before he got into that
and of course i would not be doing this
live stream
and i wouldn't be a cartoonist because i
was not
in the cartooning lane before i was
and i wasn't in this lane until i was
so stay in your lane worst
advice of all time
here's a question for you just to make
you feel uncomfortable
how how many of your decisions that
you've made during
the pandemic and of course we're all
making lots of decisions every day about
when to put on your mask do you wash
your mask
how much social distancing how close to
get so you're making hundreds of
decisions a day
about coronavirus even if you're not
thinking about it consciously
and here's what i'm wondering
there are a lot of things that we do
where we say you know i'm just going to
take a little extra
chance here i'm going to cut
a corner correct me if i'm wrong but the
only reason that we think we're being
ethical
when we cut a corner is because we don't
know who would die
right if we knew uh oh
if i don't put my mask on to talk to my
next-door neighbor
if you knew that would kill a guy named
bob
you wouldn't do it if you knew but
because you don't exactly know if
talking to your neighbor is going to
spread it one way or the other which
will get to somebody's grandparents
which will kill bob you just have no way
to know the chain of cause and effect
but that doesn't make you less
responsible does it
it just makes it harder to know who did
what
that caused what and so i had this
experience the other day
without getting into the details i had
the experience that you have
every day which is there was a thing i
could have played safe
but it was a little inconvenient and i
didn't
maybe didn't want to it's not that i
didn't know
that there was a proper way to go about
this thing it doesn't matter what it is
i knew what the proper thing was i just
got a corner i made a decision that in
this one case
i'll just cut a corner the only reason i
can do that
is cognitive dissonance that my brain
turns off and i no longer think in some
kind of a social way
that what i'm doing is part of saving
lives
just because i can't trace my specific
action to a specific death
i tell myself well it's not being
i'm not being unethical i'm just cutting
a little corner here
nobody's even going to know the
difference so
i what i noticed and by the way this
this rarely happens
the whole point of cognitive dissonance
is that you don't know you're in it
it wouldn't be cognitive dissonance if
you understood yourself to be in it you
would just think your way out of it if
you could do that
but with this coronavirus i've actually
caught myself
using cognitive dissonance to try to
rationalize my own laziness
because usually it's just convenience or
laziness where you say well
i cut a little corner now some of you
have decided that masks don't work and
that the virus isn't real
i i believe that for some of that
population
the ones who think the virus is not
really real or the ones who think
the ones that think social distancing
and masculine don't work
i feel as if there was a time when that
conversation
made sense but now it's just cognitive
dissonance
just cognitive dissonance and when you
see people argue it
it looks like nonsense now there was a
time when it was perfectly sensible to
to question you know every part of the
scientific recommendations for
coronavirus
because they got a lot wrong right it's
not like the experts were right on top
of it
in every way but it looks to me
it looks to me like there's a sizable
number of people
who believe they're involved in some
kind of a logical argument
but it is really obvious to an observer
and not just me
but to any observer who's not in
cognitive dissonance it's really obvious
all right so let me give you one example
i just saw on social media there was a
user on social media who said
argumentatively
that his child he estimates has a 1
in 250 000
risk of dying from covet one in a
quarter million
so that's the risk of the covet and he
points out quite reasonably
but what's the risk of the vaccine
we don't really even know what the risk
of the vaccine is
nothing is risk-free right even if the
vaccine
passed every standard and even if it's
the safest medicine we've ever made
even the safest medicine you've ever
made
is going to kill somebody you know
there's always somebody who's got just
the right situation where
you know and aspirin takes them out
so
uh anyway it just seems to me that our
decisions are cognitive dissonance
as much more than they are accumulated
learning
and we feel like we want to do things
that are lazy and good for us and
selfish
and so we put a veneer this little thin
veneer of cognitive dissonance on it
and we act like it doesn't matter act
like it doesn't matter
the only thing we know for sure is that
we can't tell if it matters
which is really different all right
um uh elon musk got in some trouble for
complaining about the
what he used this word the aesthetics of
pronouns so you've seen the people with
their
twitter profiles and they'll do the he
him and and
uh etc and musk complained about the
aesthetics
of the pronouns in other words it just
it just takes something that wasn't a
problem before and it makes it
harder to navigate right now his critic
said
elon musk you're being a
anti-lgbtq
really what the hell does that have to
do with being pro
or anti-lgbtq
it has nothing to do with that you know
musk is an engineer
he's simply taking one part of the
problem which
is that the pronouns are are awkward
and he's isolating that problem and he's
saying okay we got a problem with just
these words around pronouns
it's just a very engineering thing to
say is it true
100 the adds a little bit of
friction or complication it creates a
situation where you can be wrong
where before that was hard to be wrong
so
that has nothing to do with whether you
you know love or appreciate
lgbtq people it's a completely
you know independent isolated little
engineering
thought that could not be more harmless
indeed if you are lgbtq
don't you want simplicity in your life
as well
like who who wants to be more
complicated than something needs to be
now i'm i'm very much on the side
of using language that people are
comfortable with
for their own descriptions of who they
are and i try pretty hard to do that
but it's still just a fact it adds a
little friction
i don't think that's improper in any way
so
it's a weird world that even a basic
engineering
thought which would be i would say 100
agreeable
which is the weird part i'll bet there
isn't a person on the planet
not one i'll bet you couldn't find one
person
who disagrees with elon musk's point
that the pronoun thing just added some
friction to something that didn't have
friction before that's all
that's it nobody disagrees with that
cnn who's reporting and i love this
choice of words
i quote from the cnn itself tubin is
holding on to his post
i'm just gonna let that sit there for a
minute
cnn literally wrote this tuban is
holding on to his post
now as you know uh i am a
vocal supporter of jeffrey tubin
keeping his job or jobs uh
despite the fact he made a he made a
humorous
mistake on zoom by pleasuring himself
not knowing that his camera was still on
now
you don't have to make any excuse for or
you know you don't have to apologize on
his behalf or anything he did
a mistake is a mistake but it was a
mistake with no victim
and it was also a completely
understandable mistake
i mean literally this morning
this is not a joke literally
minutes ago i accidentally hit the live
button
on youtube you know 15 minutes before i
wanted to go live i just hit the wrong
button
so i was literally live on camera
to the entire planet i mean at least
they had access to it if they wanted
i was live on video to the entire planet
for about
five seconds before i realized what i'd
done
i mean how easy is it to make that
mistake now as it turns out
i was not holding onto my post
if we may say it that way so i got off
easy
so to speak but i don't want people
losing their job over
a little silly dumb mistake over the
course of a successful
career like that it's just wrong so as
much as i dislike
just about everything jeffrey toobin's
ever said on cnn
about trump i fully support him keeping
his job
and anybody who has a similar situation
has nothing to do with politics
it's just being human i mean let's give
each other a fricking break
you know let's give elon musk a frickin
break for
a reasonable opinion there was nothing
no mistake there at all
and let's give jeffrey toobin a freaking
break
give him a break it was a mistake
it's not like he even argued the point
he never
argued the point accepted it like a man
took his lumps took his embarrassment
he just sucked it up and just that's all
i'd ask from anybody
all right enough of that i'm finding
that uh
there are more artists coming out to
troll me than usual
you know it's sort of a running joke
that when an artist
comes at me on twitter it's usually the
dumbest
take almost always it's the dumbest to
take
and usually they just come with insults
and no no reasons or points or anything
and so i just do hashtag artist and
that's my only reply
because later you'll be able to search
for hashtag artist
and you'll see all the dumbest comments
from all the artists
but as i was doing that today i thought
to myself you know what i'd really like
as a filter on twitter
i would love a filter by talent stack
just as an option you know jack dorsey
was talking about
one of the things twitter is looking at
seriously i don't i don't know
you know where that's at status wise but
they were looking seriously
at letting users have control over the
algorithm
so you would be able to have one kind of
algorithm
maybe i could just turn it off maybe
there's a modified one for somebody else
and i like that idea in concept but
here's a filter i would love to see
i would love when people are onboarded
onto
twitter that and this is not practical
so this
just is conceptual i would love if
people who
signed onto twitter would uh
self-identify what skills they have
so i might say you know i've got a
degree in economics and
blah blah and then
that would give me the ability to filter
out all artists
because i would do that if i had an
option
to never hear again from anybody whose
primary job is
artist unless they also had let's say
a second degree or second talent which
would be picked up you know when you
signed up
i'd like to be able to just turn off all
the comments from people who are artists
because they don't add anything
anything there's no value at all from
the artist
because they don't understand the topics
they they're adding
noise and unpleasantness without
anything valuable now if you say to
yourself
but scott twitter is mostly about
things that are you know like that to
which i say
not exactly because there's lots of you
know ugly disagreement on twitter
but that's also part of the fun and in
that ugly disagreement often you can
get your mind changed you can learn
something somebody will point to a
useful link
somebody will frame things in a way you
hadn't thought of it before
generally speaking twitter does have the
ability to change
opinions i would say my opinion on lots
of stuff has changed
just because somebody's smart came in
and said oh you forgot about this
and then i'll say oh yeah okay changed
my mind
but i'll tell you what never happens not
even once
an artist changed my mind
i don't think it's happened and i mean
that seriously i don't think it's
happened even once
so i'd like the option of just turning
off all the artists so i can't see them
unless
they have additional skills
um all right so
i told you i've moved my videos to
rumble i forget if i told you that
uh rumble will have live streaming
it just doesn't have it yet so just look
for that later
um
oh i think i was yeah never mind so
it looks like our intelligence people
are telling us now
that russia not only hacked a number of
critical us systems but they might be so
deeply
into a lot of our important systems that
you can't get them out
which is the thing because first you get
in there with your malicious software
but once you're in
you can move things around and make
changes so that you can be there forever
without being
identified so it's possible we might
have to throw away all the software
of like all the major systems
because they're all really tainted
now here's the question with this
massive
alleged russian
access to our systems what have they
done
that we could identify as damage well
they've apparently
interfered with the election but we
don't even know
how much you know in 2016 they also
interfered with our election but the
interference
if you added it all up it wouldn't have
changed one vote i don't think
so it was fairly trivial and so i ask
you this
they have all this access but they don't
seem to be using it
at least directly in terms of you know
attacking the country and taking it down
maybe they're stealing secrets or
whatever but
here's my take on this i heard heard
some people online who don't know how
the world works saying that the trump
administration must have done a bad job
in cyber security because russia got
into everything
i don't feel like that's a thing i don't
feel like it was a possibility
that the u.s government could have
protected all of our
technology systems is that a thing
i don't think that's the thing i think
if it's
technology it's hackable and if it's a
state hacker if it's not just somebody
in their basement but it's
in an entire nation with lots of
patients
they'll wait 10 years to you know get
into a supply chain
situation there's nothing you can do to
stop that
it's not stoppable so what do you do if
you can't keep them out of your systems
well i'll make an assumption that i feel
is fair
my fair assumption is this we are so
far up or at least our cyber warfare
people
are so far up putin's ass that they can
see his tongue
meaning that there's mutually assured
destruction
at work i think it looks like
russia could take down the united states
in 10 minutes doesn't it if anything we
saw in the news today is true
russia could destroy the united states
in 10 minutes
just activate some software wipe a bunch
of servers
goodbye banking system goodbye commerce
goodbye internet
we would basically be reduced to our
technological
knees in 10 minutes and it looks like
they have the ability to do that
why don't they why don't they do that
well the reason is we would wipe them
off the map
we would we would destroy
everything that's russian
wherever it lived anywhere in the world
well
maybe we wouldn't do that but the russia
as a country would cease to exist
right so 10 minutes after they brought
down the united states
we'd probably know where it came from
and we just
take out russia now we might have to do
it with nuclear weapons or something
but we wouldn't sit there and take it we
wouldn't take it
just say oh wish that happened no
it would be maximum
response and indeed i would like to see
our
our nuclear deterrent extended
i think our nuclear deterrence should be
just extended to cyber warfare
and we should say if you nuke us we will
respond with nukes and if you take down
our technology with your
hacks we will respond with nukes
because we can't respond with technology
necessarily if you take out our
technology
but we'll respond with nukes now you can
always change your mind
if you're in that situation you could
always say well maybe we won't launch
our nukes
we'll try to deal with it but i'd like
them to think we would
i'd like to put that on the table
because we keep pretending
that regular war is the bad kind and
cyber war is sort of clean
and you know if it doesn't touch you
physically you're fine
but that's only because they haven't
weaponized it the moment russia
wanted to weaponize it as opposed to
just being annoying or
you know interfering with elections and
stuff the moment they wanted a weapon i
say it would be
plenty deadly it probably could kill
millions
probably as deadly as a nuclear war
and ultimately so we should just tell
russia look here's the deal
we know we can't stop you from diddling
with our systems but you can't stop
us either we're all up into your systems
so if you try to take us down with cyber
we will take your whole country down
with cyber and if for some reason we
can't do that
we'll nuke you because i'll tell you
what we're not going to do
let you take down the country with cyber
warfare and do nothing
that's not going to happen we would nuke
them
we should that would be my choice all
right
here's a here's a question for you we
hear a lot of news
about russia so there was the news about
the
dissident who was poisoned allegedly
by putin and putin says that's fake news
putin says if we tried to kill him he'd
be dead
and putin says if i were trying to kill
him
why did i immediately immediately allow
him to be
taken from i guess he was in
where was he in siberia or something but
putin gave him permission
the wid the wife i guess to take him to
berlin for treatment immediately
would putin let the guy he poisoned
out of the country to be cured if it
were his choice and it was his choice
it took putin to say yeah you can take
him to a hospital in berlin
why would he do that now it could be
let me give you a reason it could be
that the
um the threat of poisoning is all he
needs
right he doesn't really need the guy to
die
he probably just needs the guy to know
that
next time he's not going to be so lucky
and he probably
needs other potential dissidents to know
well he didn't die but he got really
close
so putin is probably just as well off
whether he succeeded or he got really
close to succeeding it looks
looks about the same as a warning
but i ask you this question
given that we know that all the news
about the united states the political
news
is fake news i'm exaggerating a little
bit but if you look at the amount of
news in the united states there's just
unambiguously fake news
why would you think any news about
russia is true
where does that come from who exactly
gives you the news about russia
well you know the media but
how much of it is true
what if putin did not poison that guy
it's possible right like we we all take
it as
we take it as a certainty that because
our news
has uniformly reported that putin is
almost certainly behind this poisoning
and other ones like it
we accept that that's probably true
but wouldn't it be weird if the only
news that's true
is about russia you see where i'm going
with this right
this is like the the gel man effect
where if you're looking at your
expertise as reported in the news you
know that the news is fake
because you're an expert on that subject
but then you don't know that about any
other topics you think well maybe those
other topics are better
we're doing the same thing with russia
we're looking at our own news
any news about us politics said we'd
know it's all fake
but the moment it's about russia oh yeah
that's that's pretty reliable
yeah putin's a poisoner now
i believe he did it too but do i believe
it because it's smart
do i believe it because of the evidence
i've looked at
or do i believe it just because i was
told to believe it
think about it the reason you believe
that putin poisoned
anybody is that you were told to think
that
it has nothing to do with your own
senses of yeah
your own sources your own wisdom
anything
you were simply told he did it
and again i believe he did it but my
belief
is so disconnected from reason that i'm
aware of it
that's pretty bad you know usually we're
we're doing irrational things but we
think at least we're being rational
here i'm doing a 100 irrational thing
right in front of you
i'm doing it with no shame it is my
opinion that
putin was behind those poisonings here's
my
good la rational argument for it
nothing nothing
i've only been told that by a
media that i know not to be reliable
that's
it that's all i know why do i believe it
and yet i do that's scary right
i do believe it but i shouldn't
and i can feel that i can feel that
duality in me
because they can't both you know be
smart
all right um
so there's that uh
so apparently we've got lots of evidence
that china was trying to influence our
elections so we've got russia was trying
to influence our elections
in addition to getting into our other
critical systems all over the country
we see that at least reportedly china
and iran were both into our elections
trying to influence them
now here's the interesting question
let's say it's true
that russia iran and china all were
trying to influence our election
what direction were they trying to
influence it
are they are they all on the same side
i'm a little bit confused about this
because i would think that china would
like biden
right fair assumption i would think that
russia
maybe prefers trump
i don't know but maybe or maybe they
don't think there's much difference i
don't know
uh iran probably prefers biden you would
think
but what do we know about putin
so did putin iran and china all decide
they're on the same team
when it comes to influencing our
elections or
or is it possible that the outside
influencers canceled each other out
i mean roughly speaking it wouldn't be
exact
i don't know but we have this weird
situation
where this thing that was designed to be
a you know a democratic
process within the context of a republic
it turns out that your vote is the least
important variable in the entire
election
and all of our votes the things that
matter and
joel pollock talks about a lot of this
in his new book
um uh whose title i always have trouble
with uh
neither fair nor free i think it is
um and it talks about if you look at the
media propaganda
you look at the rules changes and the
shenanigans with the rules
you look at gerrymandering
you look at the the rules changes about
how the votes were counted
you look at the non-transparency of the
vote itself
and you just go down the line and the
the variable that's the smallest and
then throw in the foreign interference
etc
and the smallest variable is
the vote because all of those other
things are bigger
than whatever the difference would be if
you could actually have a fair and free
election
without these influences so you know the
the media can move it more than that
difference
foreign interference i don't think
they've done it yet but i think they
could
you know uh if there's fraud it could
easily be big enough
don't have proof that that happened but
we have this weird situation where the
the republic and our democratic process
is pure placebo
but is that bad so
when i tell you that our democracy is a
placebo it's completely artificial
there's nothing there's nothing even
close
to something like you know the will of
the people being expressed you know in
our votes and all that
on on paper it looks like that but
there's nothing even remotely like that
happening it's just these
all these different forces of mischief
and how they
end up balancing out that's it it's the
forces of mischief
and who's got more mischief on their
team in any given year
who does better at mischief that's it
that's pretty much the whole game
so democracy is uh good and well dead
but here's the interesting thing
has it ever been different certainly you
know there were
there used to be no social media
platforms etc
so it's different in that way but do you
think the elections have ever been fair
in this country i really think maybe not
you know maybe there was some some worse
than others and
certainly if you had a candidate who
gets 70 of the vote
probably that's the will of the people
but
for anything close
uh i think it's just a pretend it's a
pretend democracy republic
situation we're literally pretending
that the vote matters now there's
nothing wrong with that
sounds sounds bad right we're just
pretending
probably this is the most important part
of the process
because the point is to convince the
public that whatever happened was
legitimate
and that's almost as important as
deciding
you know who's going to be running the
government you want the public to say
whoever it is
they're legitimate so the whole voting
thing is nothing but a psychological
experiment
or a psychological process just to make
you feel like
you were part of the process just to
make you feel like you had buy-in
just to make you feel like something
fair happened but nothing like that's
happening it's a pure
it's pure theater on top of mischief
basically
all right i'm going to defend the pete
judge buddha judge
for a moment who has been chosen i guess
for the
uh secretary of transportation
now when buddha judge was picked
to be a secretary of transportation
a lot of people said to themselves uh
what exactly
is his experience in transportation
and if you said to yourself uh wouldn't
we be better with
let's say an expert in transportation
to which i say probably not
let me tell you what i know about
consultants
and pete boudej before he was mayor
before he ran for president he was a
consultant for mckinsey
now mckinsey consultants do not hire
dumb people they hire the smartest
people they can get
they like to hire from harvard where
pete bootaj came from
and also oxford so he's got harvard and
oxford degrees
and he was a mckinsey consultant let me
explain what a mckinsey consultant
does they are people who are not experts
at the industry for which they consult
now you say to yourself
ah isn't that a problem how do you
consult for an industry
when the industry knows way more about
their industry than you do
how does that work and the answer is
it works like this consulting is
largely a fake industry
all right everybody who works for a big
company and has been in this situation
will agree with me
anybody who hasn't been through this
experience will will be thinking
i don't know if that's true that sounds
that doesn't sound quite true
look at the other comments and when i
tell you how the world really works look
at the other comments and you'll see the
agreement from the people who have this
experience
the point of hiring expensive
consultants for your business
is so that the smart employees at your
company
can finally get their way
that's what consultants do for you
because in every group you got your
smart ones and your dumb ones
and there are many situations where the
smart ones can't convince the dumb ones
to see their point of view
because that's part of being dumb right
you can't see a smart opinion it's
invisible
and sometimes that's your boss or at
least the boss
looks at the staff and says i'm getting
different opinions here
and the boss doesn't want to just pick
one because then it's the boss's
responsibility if
something goes wrong so what does the
boss do to solve this problem
where the boss doesn't know what to do
and doesn't want to make the bad opinion
they hire an expensive consultant what
happens if they
if the boss takes the advice of the
expensive consultants
and it doesn't work out well the boss
has a pretty good excuse then doesn't he
he's like look i hired the world class
consultants
i took their advice it didn't work out
i'm still a great manager
because i did everything you're supposed
to do i we just didn't get lucky this
time
it's pretty good argument i did
everything you should do
doesn't not everything works every time
so the first thing that a consultant
does
is it makes the boss more secure
and also gives them an argument that
they can take that to their boss
hey these consultants say this is a good
idea i can sell this to my boss now
if just my employees say it it's not as
strong
so the the the mckinsey people go into
a business and they sit with all the
experts in the industry
some of the dumb ones and some of the
smart ones but they all work for the
same company
and they say all right we got a bunch of
questions because they have sort of a
framework or a process
that they apply to every situation
there's sort of a standard way
to start digging in and analyzing things
so the mckinsey people start asking lots
of questions and interviewing your staff
and they very quickly learn who the
idiots are
and who the smart ones are and they
start winning out the idiots
they start listening to the smart ones
and they take what the smart ones say
and they put it into graphs and charts
and spreadsheets and make it look like a
real proper package
and then they take that to the boss of
the smart people and they say
this is what we mckenzie say you should
do
what they don't say is you know all we
did is package up what your smart people
said
but that's all they do they might they
might act like they're adding something
but
maybe not so much right so
my point is that pete butterjudge having
gone through this process
of being a mckinsey person whose
specific
training is to go into an uh a
new situation which they are not experts
in quickly become experts
because they're so damn smart i mean a
big part of their success is they're
crazy smart
the mckinsey people they're not normal
smart they're they're
crazy smart and they just package up
your smart people's ideas and
sell it back to you and take their money
suddenly it becomes credible looking
within the company etc
so what uh pete buttage brings to the
department of transportation
is exactly exactly what you want
because i got to think that the
transportation department is really
complicated
and probably has a bunch of
inefficiencies
that a mckinsey consultant or somebody
trained to be one
is going to be able to find and if the
and if the only process that p buddha
judge does is the mckinsey project
or process where he figures out fairly
quickly who the smart people are
and then he does what the smart people
want he just packages it up
so i'm gonna say maybe
maybe you don't want to hear this but i
think this
biden pick for a cabinet position
one of the best i've ever seen this
isn't just a pr
you know sort of a political pick i
think people thought that
this is one of the most perfectly on the
nose
appointments i've ever seen this is
really strong
and if biden could do more like this
i'm not going to have a big problem with
him
right if he can reproduce this
we don't know that he can but this is
just inspired this is exactly the right
person in the right job in my opinion um
twitter user human being that's just the
twitter name
uh tweets this at me scott i'm
heartbroken tonight
my beautiful five-year-old niece and her
two sisters
mother is in the hospital dying of
fentanyl use
please send an extra loud and angry
you to china for me
tomorrow happy to do it
happy to do it china
 you
and china you are my enemy you're not my
nemesis
you're not my adversary you're not my
competition you're my enemy
and we we should treat it
like that so you chyna for
killing my stepson and you for what
you've done to
uh human beings family you
 all right uh one of my big
pleasures on twitter is watching uh
andres backhouse destroy people's
data related claims it's
really entertaining so somebody will
tweet look at my graph
it proves something about sweden or
masks or
something about coronavirus and it takes
approximately
10 minutes for andreas to come in
and say and the reason you got this
wrong is
and what's funny about it is he uses
only public sources
so andreas is debunking you know one
thing after another
using nothing but stuff you can google
it takes him 10 minutes
and he's debunking like 95 of everything
you see posted on
on twitter and when you read the claim
and then you read the debunk
the debunk always looks stronger right i
don't know if that's just because
debunks always look stronger
but uh watching him demolish these uh
claims on twitter it's just really fun
you should follow him andres backhouse
b-a-c-k-h-a-u-s
um i've seen people speaking of
claims oh one of the claims he was
debunking is that uh
that the sweden uh total death not just
the pandemic
deaths but the total deaths in sweden
are actually not so bad
uh and he debunked that in two minutes
um here's another thing i would like to
debunk
so i've seen a number of tweets and
analyses and i believe there was an
expert who's
who's testified to this that if you
looked at all the anomalies in the
election presidential election
that the odds of all those anomalies
happening
and biden still being the president
would be
one in a quadrillion or whatever it is
and
i don't think you can calculate those
odds here's why
you can calculate the odds of things
that are very similar
you know of course it's just the odds
you can't know what's going to happen
but i think if let's say if the last
election were two
normal-ish candidates in a normal year
you could pretty much say that maybe
things about that would be similar
the next year but if you have a
situation that's completely unique
i don't think you can calculate the odds
can you
and the completely unique part is trump
you throw trump into the election cycle
and suddenly none of the rules and none
of the history and
everything you thought before none of it
holds
now if you have something that just
changes the nature of the situation so
much
how do you calculate the odds of
something that's never happened
happening and i feel like it's just
magical thinking that we could know the
odds
that biden would win in the context of
say
bellwether states that didn't go the way
you would expect them to
and counties that reliably go one way
usually but didn't this time
i i just feel like it's not calculable
and i guess
if andres if you're if you're watching
this i'd like your opinion on this
i feel like it's nonsense i feel as if
this was just a one-off situation there
was nothing like biden
running against trump just never been in
this situation
so everything you can say about what
that would have looked like before
even with you know similar voting
patterns of democrats and republicans in
certain areas
even with all that i feel like it's just
too different
so i discount all that there was also a
story
that china owned some part of a company
that owned part of dominion do you
remember that story did you all see that
i feel like that's uh i think i saw that
that's debunked as well
and that the nature of the ownership of
those countries
or companies was just misinterpreted so
i feel as though the
china has some interest or ownership in
the dominion
voting system i think that's fake news
now
let's do a little uh recap
how many claims have you seen about
coronavirus for example
that turned out to be you know true or
fake
and this is one of those times where
it's good to look back and see how many
times you were right
how many times did you say ah i hear
that's in the news but i think that's
fake
and how many times were you right or
vice versa you thought
maybe you thought masks don't work but
then
you're convinced that they do so you
change your mind how many times you
change your mind
during the coronavirus because i would
say i have
i'm pretty sure i've changed my mind on
a number of things
um somebody says i'm seeing in the
comments that china owns 75
of something in investor form so the the
debunk to that uh
yeah there's i'm reading in the comments
now ubs 75
china's 400 million to dominion yeah i
think that that's
uh simply a misread
of the bank's role i think the the bank
just did a transaction i think that's
the whole story
so i believe the real financial people
looking at that story
have debunked it but that's just what i
think
all right um
here's here's the prediction that i made
in the beginning i told you that
95 of the specific claims you hear about
the coronavirus would later
prove to be false also 95 percent of the
election fraud claims would prove to be
false
but let's just talk about the election
wouldn't you say don't you think it's
fair to say that 95
of the election fraud claims specific
claims
wouldn't you say 95 of them have been
debunked
pretty much exactly like i told you was
going to happen now
the other percent i wouldn't say they're
necessarily confirmed
they might just be you know not yet
debunked
um but it is completely compatible
i've seen the people say no all the
people who say no are wrong
if you were just if you were to just
make a list
just a list of all the claims and then
you
checked the list for a debunk you would
find that 95
of them have a debunk that's stronger
than the claim now
hold on i know i'm getting getting you
too angry here
it can be true that 95 of the specific
claims of election fraud
are untrue at the same time it can be a
hundred percent true
that the election was stolen do you get
do you understand there's no conflict
there there you could have a 100
chance that the election really was
stolen while
no conflict with the fact that 95 of the
evidence is not real
right there's no conflict in fact that's
exactly what you would predict
you would predict exactly this situation
and i did i predicted
in public exactly this situation which
is that the
most of the claims would be debunked and
that's because of confirmation bias
so once you get into your head that
there's something here
you see it everywhere so confirmation
bias is
very predictable it was obvious that
there would be more false claims than
real ones
even if real ones exist it's also
obvious
that if you have a system that can be
gamed with fraud and the payoff is very
high
if you were to get away with it of
course it happened
there isn't any doubt that it happened
it's just as hard to prove
so you know the election isn't going to
be changed but
somebody said you predict both sides of
everything are you stupid
[Laughter]
you predict both sides of everything are
you are you
are you uh intentionally trying to be
the dumbest
comment on here because i just told you
that those two things are not in
conflict that's really the whole point
so your comment that i i predict both
sides of something
is really stupid
if you were listening all right
um did i seem a little triggered
right then have you noticed that in the
holiday season people get a little tense
you know you can you can get wound up
pretty quickly
um like spygate
which one was spygate i don't even
remember what spygate was
uh somebody says 95 percent of claims
could not be proved
not that they're true no i'll say that
95 have been debunked
so uh i i hear what you're saying but i
i disagree with it all right you were
very wrong
say people in the comments
totally wrong
so there's a separate issue as i'm being
prompted in the comments
it is true that the courts have not
ruled
on a lot of the specifics that's not
quite what i'm talking about
i'm talking about if you go to twitter
and you see any claim
whether it got into a court case or not
you will see a debunk
95 percent of the time that's pretty
good
all right uh
so bitcoin's still going up
somebody said let's see what our bitcoin
situation is here
oh my god bitcoin is really going up
okay cool i was going to do a
special class on investing some
investing stuff but i haven't decided
whether to do that yet
all right that's enough for now i will
talk to you later
and youtube people got a few more
minutes with me
what's trump's next move
uh my guess is he's looking at all of
his options for the next four years
and probably hasn't decided yet
all right i guess that's all for now
we'll talk to you tomorrow
