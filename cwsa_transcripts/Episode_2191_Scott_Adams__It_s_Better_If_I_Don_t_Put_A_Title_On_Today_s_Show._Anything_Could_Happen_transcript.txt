to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and wow
did you pick the right day to come
we got a show for you like the show of
shows like no show has ever been better
than any Show everybody's saying so and
if you'd like to take it up to levels
that are unheard of all you need is a
cup of mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea
style and I can't feed jungler flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee join me
now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
yeah extra good this morning it was a
little extra good
there are no bonus points for gargling
no no no no no no
hold on we've got a couple of eye
Achievers here they're trying to take it
beyond the simultaneous
to gargling no no the Sip is good enough
stay don't go to gargle
well we got all kinds of news obviously
we'd be talking about the uh
Trump stuff we'll get to that but while
people are streaming in to watch
apparently mayor Adams no relationship
to me in New York City
is considering putting migrant camps in
Central Park and a bunch of other places
in New York City
what do you think of that
a migrant camp in Central Park
how about let me let me see if I can
figure out how best to manage this
situation
how about we do I don't know the only
thing that was possible to do that could
work
how about that yes literally the only
thing that would be a good idea
is to find some public space
put up some tents and get them off the
sidewalks
where the other people don't want to
walk past them of course this is a good
idea
it's because compared to the other ideas
the other ideas are horrible
do you think you'd be happy to know
there's a migrant camp in the middle of
Central Park if you lived in New York
City no you wouldn't be happy about it
but it's way better than the alternative
and now what's the third alternative
name one other thing you can do let's
see uh kill them all put them in jail
ship them back you can't do that it's a
sanctuary City
what are you gonna do
yeah they're basically down to one
option so even talking about
that as an option is weird because it's
really a tent on the sidewalk
or a tenth in the park it's kind of a
no-brainer so yes tens of the park
and as I told you before I've invested
in uh camping
as a personal investment
I bought a business a company that does
camping stuff because I just I just feel
like
I hate to say it but a lot of humankind
is going to move Outdoors
does it seem like that to you
that we're kind of at a point where just
a whole bunch of humans are going to be
living Outdoors
and I'm not even sure they'll be less
happy
you know if it's someplace where the
climate is survivable
I don't know they might be happier who
knows
well I say that human women are 20
obsolete roughly speaking and by that I
mean 20 of human males
probably would already choose an AI
companion
because the big story is there's a AI
influencer there are probably more of
them that are completely artificial
they're just digital Creations that look
like Cuban women
except very attractive
and men are sending them money and
forming connections and stuff I would
say that at the moment right now current
technology
20 percent of women are obsolete
and by that I mean
that if you had a choice of matching up
with one of the least you know the
bottom 20 percent of women
you'd probably choose an AI woman
instead
if you could get you know somebody in
the top five percent you probably still
prefer a human woman very much so
but the bottom twenty percent
you don't think I would prefer right now
if the only option I had was a woman who
was in let's say the bottom twenty
percent of desirability
that was my only option
but I have an option for an AI
creature that could be my companion
there's no contest I would take the AI
all day long
right am I am I am I talking crazy
is that crazy
now here's what I say to you
for for every single person who tells me
that that's weird and creepy and wrong
and will never happen I say to you you
do not understand the depth of the
um loneliness problem in the United
States
right loneliness is one of those things
that if it's not bothering you
personally it's kind of invisible
isn't it
other people's loneliness doesn't bother
you do you know why
because you're not with them
by definition yeah others be other
people's loneliness doesn't bother you
because you're not with them
it's just something happening in a
stranger's head That You Don't See
so you've got this enormous loneliness
problem in the United States one of our
biggest problems I would say very near
the top for our biggest problems and the
AI is clearly the solution
and there's no way that you're not going
to see
at least 20 to 30 percent of the public
the male public especially going to AI
companions I I think in five years
thirty percent of men will have ai
generated companions
thirty percent of men in five years
that's my that's my prediction
somebody says you're projecting
that is my point
now you're not disagreeing with me all
right let me say that again somebody
says I'm projecting when I say the 30 of
men will have ai companions
that's my point my point is I'm
projecting
I'm saying that if you were if you had
experienced any loneliness in the past
year you know if you've gone through a
divorce Etc if if you've experienced
that you agree with me
all right that's the absolutes are weird
but mostly if you've experienced it you
agree with me
if you haven't experienced that you say
oh you're you're projecting there can't
be that many people like you Scott no my
point is you don't know how many people
there are like me
now at the moment I'm not that lonely
right so if you're looking at me you
know this week
you know I'm getting my life slowly you
know rebuilding from you know divorce
you know discombobulation so I'm in good
shape at the moment I I have zero
interest in the AI companion at the
moment
but if but if you take me back to any of
the days let's say immediately following
divorce
and how that feels if that had been any
permanent situation and I'm lucky
because I'm I'm healthy and I'm rich and
I'm a public figure
so as you might imagine it's kind of
easy for me to make friends
yeah there's like no there's just no
barrier I can make as many friends as I
want so I you know I can fix my problem
I don't have any problem that needs to
be fixed yeah it just takes a little
while to to manage things but if I were
in that situation and didn't didn't see
a way out if I didn't see your way to
make friends or to have any kind of
human interaction yeah absolutely I'd go
Ai and if you don't see that
you're really going to be blindsided by
one of the biggest threatens
all right
um
and ladies if you thought that you could
abuse nerds for uh over a hundred years
and the Nerds would not find a way to
invent something to replace you well you
were
he had a little blind spot there I think
a little bit of a blind spot right yes
of course the Nerds are going to replace
women who who don't have interest in
nerds now when I say nerds I mean that
in the most
complementary way
I love engineers
and Technical people
so I think they're going to do what they
have to do they're going to build
themselves some friends
all right I saw a tweet by men's sexual
health
and there was a list of the
well they call it the uh eight signs of
a good woman
would you like to know the eight signs
of a good woman
all right
now you want to get all eight
you want to get all eight of these so
look at the women around you
and see which ones could hit all eight
number one loyal
modest
tattooless now this is somebody else's
opinion I'm not reading my opinion this
is from a men's Sexual Health that's
just the name of the Twitter account
uh no male friends
no male friends uh not glued to her
phone
doesn't have Instagram or tick tock is
mentally and emotionally stable
and has a good relationship with her
father
now I've never seen such a strong
endorsement of the Amish
but it's a good thing the Amish are
finally getting their due and Amish
women
boom Amish women killing it
so if you like a woman who is as men's
Sexual Health says a good woman if you
want a good woman
oh don't get any of those harlots with
tattoos
don't come home with some tattooed
harlot
when you can have an Amish woman
and really really get the good stuff
all right
um
I saw one prediction from Jean Francois
and if you don't mind
I'm going to pronounce his name again
just for my own fun
so you could talk among yourselves but
I'd like to add to wrestle with this
name a little bit more garibi
I hope that's close anyway all right he
has a he has a white pilling kind of a
opinion that if you have a bunch of AI
digital fake women
it will make the uh the real human women
who are trying to look pretty on social
media a diamond as
because if right now if you see a
beautiful woman on social media you say
to yourself whoa a real live beautiful
woman but suppose nine out of 10 of them
were not real
what if nine out of 10 is just not real
well you you would maybe slowly or even
quickly decide that looking at these
pictures on social media was just not
doing it for you anymore
because it was just you would just be
overwhelmed with the same look right it
was just ah yeah it's perfect then when
you saw a real human you'd be like a
little flawed
so one thing might be that the AI you
know women posing on AI may become a
thing of the past
because they would be competing with AI
and losing the AI would just look better
so
um maybe maybe but I think that uh
I think the real big change is going to
be people having real AI companions all
right let's talk about politics I know
that's why you're here
so uh Vivek uh is
I feel like a broken record
every day I wake up and every day
there's a new story about the vague
ramaswami getting the so-called earned
media in other words he's doing
something in the real world that makes
the media is impossible to ignore him
do you remember what Chris Christie did
this week
I don't do you remember what Tim Scott
did this week
probably talk to people
do you remember what Pence did this week
uh got blamed for some said some
dumb that's it
that's all you know about all those
other candidates right but what do you
know about Vivek well this is just one
of the three things he's going to do
today that are newsworthy he's proposing
a
Constitutional Amendment that requires
citizens from 18 to 24 to pass a Civics
test in order to vote
the same test immigrants have to take to
become naturalized citizens
do you like it or I hate it love it or
hate it
you can't vote even if you're a natural
citizen you'd have to have a
constitutional amendment
but you've got to be at least as aware
of the country as the immigrants
who have to pass the test to become
citizens yeah
so here's uh let me talk about this in
two different ways from a political
perspective was this a good play
from a political perspective
you know no hold on we're talking about
it
no we're talking about it so it's a good
play
remember when Trump would say crazy
things that you you wouldn't even agree
with it went too far
but then you learn that the more
attention you get the better you do
so he's getting attention if you don't
like the idea that's irrelevant to the
politics because the politics is about
earning attention and you just got some
got some free attention
this is he's just killing it
nobody's coming close
to the level of uh let's say strategic
intelligence and execution that uh
Rama Swami is bringing to the thing
nobody's close he's just killing it the
second best is RFK Jr who's actually
doing a good job as well actually a
great job I I'm gonna I'm gonna Elevate
RFK Jr he he and Vivek are really
standing out in terms of how to run a
campaign in an Innovative way that I
think will change campaigns forever
here's the other thing
the vake is running a campaign
that's changing the real world
who did that before
anybody
Vivek is actually changing opinions in
the real world about actual real topics
while he's running for office he's
changing opinions
that that is so next level you don't
even expect your candidate to change the
real world do you you don't expect you
do not expect the real world to change
because somebody's running for office
but he's actually changing the real
world one of the ways he's changing it
is he's proven there's a better way to
campaign
he's already completely changed what
people understand about how a good
campaign would run
if you keep ignoring Vivek you're
missing one of the greatest shows
of all time
he he's found a way to push into the
conversation with no prior experience
only one person has done that
Trump
and Trump you know Trump at least was
famous forever right Vivek had a had a
good book
and that was enough like that's how much
game he has he managed to push his way
into the top of the conversation
from nowhere
just with skill
just skill that's what it took
now part of it is that he's
demonstrating exactly what he promotes
so he's promoting
um he's promoting competence above you
know racial identity and other
identities that's his whole theme
don't you love the fact that he's
demonstrating it while he does it
right like you've I don't know I don't
know if you've yet forgotten the fact
that some would say he's a person of
color
he's made it irrelevant
hasn't he the the only thing that his
you know his ethnicity the only thing it
is is maybe a negative if somebody
thinks they don't know what a Hindu is
and by the way let me remind you again
if you're worried about a Hindu you need
to look into it that's that's not who
you need to be worried about right you
don't need to be worried about Hindu
I don't know what you think a Hindu is
but just Google it you know do something
that there's not a lot of big Hindu
problems at least in the United States
right
yeah it's very it's a very respected uh
community
so
um
so that's interesting RFK Jr is suing
Google for censoring him I don't know
how you could win that that feels like
something you couldn't win but is it a
good idea
it's a great idea he's running for
president it's a great idea because win
or lose he's now made me pay attention
to the fact that YouTube's censored it
now I was kind of vaguely aware of it
but doesn't it help him a lot to like
bring it to the front of my mind yeah
this is good
so RFK Jr free free media doesn't matter
if he wins or lose it's the right it's
the right play it just is the right play
um just answers to Newsom apparently
it's going to be real they're really
going to have a debate Hannity is going
to host it
which is pretty baller for Newsom I
gotta admit
I I got let me give Newsome some credit
he agreed to a debate on a house by
Hannity
you want to know a little secret
this is something I learned a while ago
I can't I can't tell you that right now
but there are people on the on the left
who really like Hannity in person
did you know that
that when you know if you're not talking
about the on-air performances they had
it he's actually somebody that liberals
actually like in person he's kind of
popular
so it's not a this isn't as weird as you
think it's not as weird to have Hannity
who you would imagine would be you know
a deep deep partisan in this but he's
actually more respected by the left than
you think
and I would be I'm very interested to
see if he can pull this off if if
Hannity can pull off a debate
where Hannity himself does not become
the subject of the conversation
that would be a tremendous
accomplishment
if Hannity can pull this off and even
the left says okay you know that was
just a good debate I'm glad we saw it if
he can pull that off it'll be one of the
greatest things you've ever seen
I don't think he can honestly I'm going
to bet against it because uh you know
the left is too primed to assume that
whatever he says and anything he does is
going to look partisan but if he could
pull it off so that even the left looked
for something to complain about but they
just couldn't find it
that would be amazing that would be
amazing so I always I've I have a very
high opinion of Hannity's capabilities
really high he's one of those talented
snack guys where you know if you look at
any one thing the energy does you could
think well I can think of somebody who
can do that better
but try to find somebody who can do all
of the things that Hannity can do
at the same time
good luck all right he's he's a pretty
unique individual and he did it the
old-fashioned way
took chances built up his skill set
collected a set of skills that work well
together implemented them in the right
place worked hard
perfect role model
in the in the work sense you don't have
to agree with this opinions that would
be a separate topic
all right uh and I also like the fact
that both Newsome and DeSantis agreed to
this because what it does is well I'm
talking myself out of it as I'm talking
but my first thought was it makes you
think past the sale
right the sale is can you see these
second-tier candidates as serious
opponents like actually running for the
top job
and if you have them debate your mind
automatically goes to oh that's a that's
a legitimate
competition if they had never debated it
would be easier to dismiss them
assuming Biden stays in the race
that is not important but the the mere
fact that they would have their own
debate
does sell you a picture of them being in
second place
and that's probably a story that they're
happy with at the moment I think
DeSantis would be completely happy being
the solid second place choice because
the risk is that something happens with
Trump legally and he can't run
or something else yeah there's also an
age risk
so I'd say that's all good I like
everything about everything from top to
bottom I like everything
about the DeSantis Newsom debate
including including Hannity as the
moderator because you know what I'd
rather have somebody who is well known
as a let's say a partisan
and then they have to work as hard as
they can to not look like it in public
I like that because if you put in
somebody who's like allegedly
independent
you know let's say you put in uh Brett
Baier
all right Brett Bear in my opinion is
actually wonderfully nonpartisan
right I mean he works at an entity that
covers a certain set of news but when he
presents it he does a really good job of
not being a partisan but I think he
would be more of a problem in this case
because if you have somebody who's
brand is non-partisan everybody's going
to be debating his brand and whether it
was really non-partisan but if you put
Hannity in there
he's got the highest bar of all to look
like he's not favoring one candidate
and so you're really going to make him
work for it
right so it's interesting we'll see now
I think there's I think it's on
it's unpredictable how people will you
know regard it and have a little turnout
and it's very unpredictable how Hannity
would do but there is a possibility you
could nail it because he has this skill
he does have the skill to nail it
all right
um
Trump has famously uh truth
if you go after me I'm coming after you
I would think that almost everybody
would interpret that as talking about
his legal Jeopardy at the moment
and that who he's coming after would be
anybody who is on the other side of him
and that in that
so how do you feel about that
do you think that well of course the
legal system already warned him off and
said hey don't do that you're trying to
you know this would bias people and blah
blah blah so of course the legal system
is pushing back at him
um but here's my take
If This Were a normal criminal trial
then having the person who's the
defendant threaten the people who might
be trying to put him in jail directly
and publicly
very very bad
very bad and I would certainly want the
judge to try to you know Tamp that down
as hard as possible very very bad
however I don't think there are any uh
honest observers who think this is a
criminal trial
not honest ones I'll give you that lots
of you there might be people even
watching here who think this is really
about crimes
and if you do I just feel sorry for you
yeah I just have some empathy for what
what has been done to you but if you're
like everybody else you see this as the
people who actually pay attention you
see this as a purely political Act
in the context of a purely political act
I do want as much threatening as
possible
so I'm totally in favor of trump saying
if you come for the king
and you miss I'm going to burn you down
that's exactly what I want to hear
that's the safest situation
I want the Republic to avoid all danger
I want the Republic to have no violence
I want the Republic to have no
Revolution
I want the Republic to run the way the
citizens want it you know educate things
adjudicate things and give us some
results and let us go on with our lives
no violence
how do you get no violence
do you know why there's no violence in
my house
does anybody know why
because I'm capable of violence
that's right
the reason that somebody doesn't just
kick down my door and take my
is because I'd kill him
that's why that's the only reason is
there another reason no there is not
there's not another reason
right citizen the the risk of male
violence is the only thing that keeps
civilization together
you know Jordan Peterson says it best so
if you want to see the the smart version
of that arguments he is but civilization
is held together
by males entirely women are not part of
the conversation
by males putting up incredible threats
of violence
to each other and by the way we all see
it
so let me say it directly Trump says if
you go after me I'm coming after you
ladies sit it out
you can set this one out
this is this is not about the women of
America anymore
this is about the men of America and
Trump just put down the you put down the
fact I don't even call this a threat
this is a statement of fact
if this light is crossed
and Trump spends one day in jail
let me tell you as a male who lives in
America
all the rules are gone
that that all the rules are gone
one day in jail
and every every man listening to it
knows what I'm saying
Every Woman listening to it might know
but you're not part of the conversation
you are not part of the conversation
this is pure
male business
because it's the men who are keeping
things from becoming violent by being
violent by being naturally violent
and this is where the men will take
complete control
of this situation you'll never know it
you'll never know it
but let me say as clearly as possible
if Trump is jailed for what is obviously
just a political
Act
the rules are gone
so deal with that
again I do not promote any kind of
violence against anybody for any reason
but if somebody else takes all the rules
away
I will play in the new game as
vigorously as I can
right but no violence
so I'm 100 behind Trump saying that if
they come for him in a political trial
that there should be no controls on what
he does back to them if Trump were to
win now let's say he's in prison he wins
anyway he gets he pardons himself I
would be completely in favor of him
immediately jailing every person who is
involved in this
and then let them work it out on their
own get some lawyers
I mean whatever it takes
I put every one of them in jail
because you need you need a credible
mutually assured destruction to keep the
Republic safe
right everything I'm talking about is to
is to avoid war
is to avoid Civil War that's that's all
I want I want to avoid violence you
can't do it by being weak
everybody knows that well maybe women
don't know it well men know it right can
I get a vote every man knows you don't
you don't be safe by being non-violent
that is not the path to safety 100 of
men understand that in their DNA all
right it's not an intellectual argument
there's no thinking involved
trust us
trust the men
you need violence
to be safe
that's it there's no argument to that so
Trump has uh has gone as he does he's
gone through the and the
 is did he do a crime
that really is just
right what matters is how you're going
to feel about it
how are you going to feel about it and
he just told you how he feels about it
so there you go so this is the very
definition of too far and as a public
service give me a give me a little uh
sanity check here
do you agree with the statement that as
that is it keeps the country safe to be
as clear as possible about where the the
boundaries are
do you agree this is a boundary question
right putting putting Trump in jail on a
political charge even if you can make
your little argument
your little argument won't have any
impact on anything
we don't even want to hear your legal
argument
well do you think I would care if uh if
the court had a good argument no no
that's not that's not in any part of my
thinking
this this is about a boundary
and this is a solid boundary
right
you if you pass this boundary there are
no rules
you don't want to live in that world
because you know how that goes
all right
you got a little quiet there didn't you
uh meanwhile in the absurdity Olympics
we've got secretary Anthony blinken who
said this thing
just just imagine this this is our
government this is a Democrat
was he secretary of state right the
United States strongly condemns Russia's
conviction of opposition leader Alexei
navalny on politically motivated charges
the Kremlin the Kremlin cannot silence
the truth
navalny should be released
he's actually saying this at the same
time that his party is trying to jail
Trump on political charges
this is actually happening
like that this is a real thing that's
happening at the same time
this idiot is tweeting this at
the same time he's insulting
the citizens of the United States by
doing the same thing
he's just doing the same thing
amazing
all right we'll talk about this a little
bit more but in other news there's a new
pill for postpartum depression
do you think it works
that's the whole story there's a new
pill for postpartum depression
I say no
do you know why because I don't believe
everything
if it's in the news I just assume it's
right because where are you the place
you go to find lies is the news
I don't believe any medical claim
anymore
literally well I believe that smoking
cigarettes causes cancer but so I guess
I'm going too far I don't believe any
new medical claim
I don't care who says it I don't care
what the source is I don't care how they
studied it I don't care if it's a
randomized controlled trial
I don't care I just literally do not
believe any medical news
would I ever be wrong about that yes
yes
but I didn't give myself to this point
like I didn't talk myself into this
was the outside world beating the
out of me until I stopped believing
things
that I shouldn't have believed in the
first place
so I hate to say it but
I would never give anybody a new pill
for anything just for anything
now by the way I'd like you all to uh
follow along as I probably kill myself
by um
ignoring medical advice
I am currently ignoring medical advice
in in a very aggressive way
right so I stopped taking uh blood
pressure medications
because I don't believe them
I don't believe it's real
now do not do not take medical advice
from me
you should you should make you up your
own mind talk to your doctor
maybe you belong on blood pressure
medications I'm just telling you that I
can find no source of information I
would trust and I'm not even going to
look I'm not even going to look because
I know there's no Source I would trust
of course there's going to be tests that
say it works of course there are
what's that tell me nothing
right in 2023 there's a whole bunch of
science that says these pills will keep
you alive that doesn't mean anything
I wish it did I would love to tell you
oh I know I'm being a science denier now
but you know probably probably killing
some of you
I mean literally I'm probably killing
several of you right now because there's
somebody out there who's going to say
you know he's making a good point I'll
throw away my blood pressure meds and
then I'll die don't do what I'm doing
this is not a conversation about
medicine
I'm telling you my state of mind right
so you should not adopt my state of mind
and you should make your own medical
decisions do not discontinue any
medications because you're the
cartoonist say so okay
although I think I already went too far
on that
sometimes I forget how persuasive I can
be don't stop taking your medications
because you heard me say it okay please
please don't stop your medications
please don't do that yeah I don't want
to kill anybody today it's only it's
only a conversation about my state of
mind
okay
all right
um
Greg Gutfeld had a uh great take on how
all of our institutions are corrupt
except the elections
everything in the world from a
Department of Justice to the financial
world to the political world it's all
proven to be corrupt but those elections
are good
he of course got some pushback on that
um and so I thought I'd back him a
little bit on that so I tweeted that
uncertainty is the only smart take
when every other American system has
been demonstrated to be corrupt
in my opinion the people who say the
election was rigged and the people who
say the election was not rigged are the
same people
to me they look the same it's two people
who have certainty in a domain in which
certainty is absurd
it's absurd to be certain that was true
it's absurd to say that you know it was
fixed
unless you have some evidence I haven't
seen and it's absurd to say that it
wasn't how would we know
so the two ridiculous opinions are that
it was rigged or that it wasn't those
are ridiculous opinions
and watching and by the way the 81
million votes part is the worst part of
the argument okay let me let me let me
stop It embarrasses me when I hear that
honestly
that of embarrasses me to be kind of
associated with that argument
the 81 million can be explained entirely
by the fact that eight years had passed
or a number of years have passed the
population is larger
and the candidate running was Trump and
the News had an unprecedented you know
opinion on Trump
every indicator suggests that it should
have been record voting
every indicator suggests it should have
been record voting and we got record
voting that is the weakest argument for
a fraud that by far that's the weakest
now that one is just embarrassing
honestly now I get that it's sort of the
bumper sticker View and keep in mind I'm
not saying the election was fair
I'm also not saying it was unfair I'm
saying the 81 million is the weakest
argument
for evidence it was unfair the second
weakest argument is that the votes
switched from Trump being ahead to
Democrats being ahead
completely explained by the fact that
Republicans vote in person and then
ballots from Democrats come in later
right now I don't know if that's true
but it is an explanation which fits the
facts
so your weakest argument
is that there was a sudden change in the
voting that's really weak
and the other one is that a lot of
people voted in the most controversial
election of all time of course a lot of
people voted
if it wasn't a record that would have
been the strange thing wouldn't it be
more strange if it wasn't a record
right so
and let me say again as clearly as
possible
is it possible that the 81 million is a
fraudulent number
yeah absolutely how would I know
absolutely it's possible
is it a strong indication that it was
rigged because of the 81 million no
that's a terrible terrible argument
I think you could only have that
argument if you're really locked in the
bubble
if you spend a minute outside the bubble
that falls apart right away
right now again I do think
there are arguments about the election
that might be strong
might be
you know I'd have to look into them
there might be but it's not those two
you actually hurt yourself when you make
either those claims because because if
you make those claims outside the bubble
the other the people outside the bubble
know that those are the weakest claims
so if you want to if you want to make
the people outside the bubble agree with
you don't use those
are only inside the bubble hey I agree
with your bumper sticker kind of thing
I I actually laugh when I see the 81
million stuff when the 81 million isn't
a meme I think it's great I laugh
but don't take that seriously it was the
it was the most controversial election
of course the numbers were through the
roof
some of them might have been fake I
don't know
who knows
so anyway here's what I said um
I said that Garfield's trying to found
The High Ground here
and now in theory what happens if you
have two arguments that are irrational
and then somebody gives you the rational
argument
what happens to the people who have the
irrational takes so the irrational ones
that you know it's you know there was no
fraud or also that you know there was
cognitive distance right so the
predictable outcome should be cognitive
distance so this is one of those places
in nature where you you get to learn
what cognitive dissonance looks like
so uh here's an example
um somebody tweeted immediately after uh
Greg's tweet it's unprovable all in caps
unprovable so the burden of proof is on
you Greg in other words somebody's
saying oh oh nice try you election
denier but it's unprovable that the
um
the the burden of proof has to be on you
now is that cognitive dissonance
yes it is
because it's not even on the same topic
this is somebody who had to imagine that
Greg said the election was rigged you
didn't say that he's never said that
have you ever heard him say that nope
not once
not once never said it
in fact you said literally the opposite
he said there's no way to know either
way
right and the very first comment it's
unprovable so the burden of proof is on
you in other words somebody imagined
they saw an election denier and that was
the opposite of what they saw
right so if you look at the other
comments if you want to learn what
cognitive dissonance looks like this is
a perfect one because there is no
argument with I mean there's no rational
argument with we can now
there's no rational person who argues
that point
it's only irrational people who are
going to debate that
all right
uh Elon Musk uh not too happy with the
New York Times today you know the story
about the uh the political party in
South Africa
there was chanting or singing the song
kill the boar which apparently is you
know the borrowers of the white people
and so the news about that was oh no
these racists are saying kill the white
people this should be stopped well as
Elon Musk points out the the New York
Times decided to back the people who
were chanting kill the white people
seriously
seriously
and their explanation is that it's
really just a it's an old
anti-antiapartheid chant and of course
you you don't like apartheid right
nobody likes apartheid so you would
consider yourself anti-apartheid just
like them
so they are just you basically they're
they're anti-apartheid you're
anti-apartheid they have a song
it's just an anti-apartheid song kill
the white people
so I think you should be way less
excited or or concerned that in the
context of them actually them at least
in the country that a lot of white
people being killed for being white that
there would be somebody who's a major
political party uh all black it looks
like from the pictures uh chanting
killed the white people the boars
and uh so the walls the New York Times
decided to side with the people chanting
kill the white people
and when I say side with them I mean
just described it as not a big deal it's
just an old song
don't worry about the old song
yeah
I wonder if they say the same about the
um I couldn't go there
third rail
foot third rail
let's keep it off at the moment
so musk says uh he must tweets the New
York Times actually has the nerve to
support calls for genocide
uh if ever there was a time to cancel
that publication it is now and then he
says you can read their articles for
free anyway it gives the
use the remove paywall.com
um
uh URL
by the way I didn't know about that so
you can read the New York New York Times
for free I guess
and I plan to do just that if I ever
have to look at that rag so I thought
I'd run a poll since it would seem that
the New York Times is is siding
aggressively with uh racist murderous
racists that's what it seems like I
thought I wonder how other people think
so I read a little poll on Twitter and I
asked this question who is more racist
than New York Times or me
and as you know
I'm one of the most famous racists there
is
it's true do you know why it's true
the New York Times said so
yeah yeah the New York Times said so
it's got to be true right The Washington
Post said so too
well it's got to be true
is the Washington Post and New York
Times Senate
must be true so I thought I would test
how much of a racist I am according to
the public and uh so when I compared
myself against the New York Times for
who's the biggest racist 95 said the New
York Times was a bigger racist than me
so I'm gonna have to up my game a little
bit
I was only able to capture nine five
percent of the public but I think I can
do better
the New York Times though is killing me
in this all right so I've said before
that I disagree with boycotts
I generally don't like them I don't
think I would have done the Bud Light
boycott frankly although I have to admit
it worked you know from a political
standpoint totally worked
okay can I say that without any
ambiguity
the Bud Light boycott
completely worked you you don't think
that that caused other companies to say
whoop whoop whoop
back off
of course it did of course it did it
completely worked now the problem with
boycotts is not that they don't work
boycotts can work I just don't like them
because everybody will start boycotting
everybody do you see the point yeah you
know as soon as it becomes the go-to
tool then all the left will be boycotted
by the right and the right will be
boycotted by left yeah it's a very big
drag on the free market
right now presumably there would be a
you know a 7-Eleven for conservatives
and someday a 7-Eleven for just
progressives
yeah maybe you know maybe the free
market could work it out but I don't
need two 7-Elevens
I'm quite happy shopping in the 7-Eleven
with people who disagree with me
politically
so I don't want the economy destroyed by
a bunch of boycotts however I'm going to
make an exception on this one
because if they're backing people
calling for my murder I think I think I
think that might be a lie and this is
too far
too far yeah a little bit too far now I
understand the argument that it's an old
song and it should not be taken
literally
that's a stupid argument
right that's like say you could use the
n-word because well it's just a
historical word nobody Muses it
seriously you couldn't possibly think
we're using this as any kind of a racist
way it's just the old way we used to
talk I just thought it'd be ironic if I
talked to them the old way for a while
oh no it's just oh I no no it's an
anti-slavery word no when I use the
n-word what I mean is I'm opposed to
slavery
all right this is a stupid argument
stupid analogy so yes the New York Times
I think deserves to be completely out of
business
this is way over the line
that you can't call for genocide against
white people even in your weird little
indirect way where you say you're not
because they are in effect they're
they're basically putting a little uh
let's say
a little coat of respectability to the
call for white genocide
nope you do not get it so now the they
have to go out of business New York
Times has to be put out of business
one way or the other that's got to
happen now
all right um
Ellen dershow had said the scariest
thing you've ever heard in your life
an opinion about the Trump legal
problems he said that Trump will
probably be convicted
and probably the first appeals court
would uphold it and then almost
certainly the the Supreme Court would
throw it out
what do you hear when you hear that
now you might hear oh it'll all be okay
you know if you're an optimist I would
all be okay in the in the end Supreme
Court will throw down Trump will spend
zero time in jail there will be no
convictions we go on with their lives it
could happen it could happen just the
way he laid it out I think it will
actually that's the most likely outcome
most likely income
but isn't there something we're
accepting as okay
at what point did we start talking
casually about the fact there's no real
there's no reasonable chance
that the D.C courts
would rule fairly
we're actually talking about the Court's
Prosecuting him for political reasons
and we're talking about that like that's
just a normal thing oh yeah but that'll
get reversed in the Supreme Court
how in the world did we start talking
about the courts not functioning in
America because that's what it would be
it would be not functioning
how did we get how do we talk about that
matter of factly
where where did that come from how about
that's the biggest problem in
the world because the only thing that
keeps the entire planet from burning
is that some countries like the United
States have a justice system that is
credible most of the time
as soon as we take it for granted that
the DC you know the the heart of power
the most important courts would be where
your heart of power is right
as soon as we take it for granted that
they're not a functioning real Court
I that's a problem
don't you think that um we need some
kind of a martial law to replace the
courts in in D.C
don't you think we need a perhaps a
Constitutional Amendment
this says that you can't be tried in
Washington D.C
I'd be in favor of that I would be in
favor of saying that it is illegal to be
tried for any crime in Washington DC
because it becomes political
now maybe maybe you could separate the
politically oriented crimes from the
regular crimes yeah that makes sense but
there should be a law that says all
there no politician can be tried in
Washington D.C
it shouldn't even be an option
and I think for fake you know this
sounds like a vague kind of a thing
because he's the only one bold enough to
recommend changes that we all know we
need and by the way this should be you
know if there's somewhere else like
Washington DC I'd say the same thing
right it's not about Washington DC if
you've got a place
uh let me just summarize
if one of the most eminent
lawyers in the United States Ellen
dershowitz can say matter-of-factly that
the first and maybe even the second
ruling will be
unfair by Design unfair and we all know
it unfair and everybody can see it
so much so that the Supreme Court will
certainly overturn it
uh you know maybe you should be worried
that you know what the Supreme Court
will do
let's turn this around for a minute
how did we design the system where you
know in advance what the Supreme Court
will do because you kind of do
now in this case I'm just happy about it
that that would be a backstop for the
worst case scenario
but you could easily see
you could you could easily imagine that
the Supreme Court looks uh illegitimate
from the perspective of the left
because the left also can predict what
the the Supreme Court will do if you can
predict what they'll do
I'm not entirely sure that's a real
Court
I mean again I'm happy that it's
conservative dominated because even
though I personally am left of Bernie
I don't want my court to be making
up
I don't want them to make stuff up I
want them to you know try to like follow
the rules and stuff
so that you know that suggests a
conservative Court
but that has nothing to do with left or
right
you know the left should want a
conservative Court in my opinion but
obviously that's a rare opinion on the
left
all right so that's the most alarming
thing that we just talk about that like
it's nothing
all right uh
I saw Michael schermer tweet
uh I guess Joe Rogan was interviewing
one of the pilots that saw the Tic Tac
UFO
and that same pilot who reported the Tic
Tac UFO
there's probably more than one I guess
um admits to hoaxing UFOs
and gave details about how he did it
so the way you do it was
um
I guess they would try to convince
campers that they saw a UFO because
there's a way he could do something with
his jet
that from the ground would look like
something impossible that happened in
other words he could create the illusion
that the physics had been violated
because of an optical illusion at night
in how he flies his plane
yeah I guess turning off the lights or
something I don't know so the details
don't matter but how do you feel about
the existence of UFOs when one of the
main
Witnesses admits in the past faking UFOs
and I saw I think Michael Sherbert said
this as well
the reason that people think UFOs are
real is that it's hard to believe that
anybody who's a human being
would make up such a detailed story and
put themselves you know in the middle of
it it just doesn't seem like something a
normal person would do
so you say to yourself nobody would do
that it must be real or at least they
must think it's real no nobody would
intentionally do a hoax like that
do you know who does hoaxes like that
people
people
since the beginning of time there's
never been a time in human history where
there weren't lots and lots of people
usually men
usually men maybe always men maybe 99999
man
who will tell you absolutely anything
for various reasons make money because
it's funny
usually because it's funny
yeah usually because it's funny
so if you deny you know if you deny the
existence of hosters you're a hoaxster
denier
no hosters exist
definitely exists have I ever personally
tried to fake a UFO sighting
no common
thank you
of course I have
you you don't think at least once I've
taken a picture of a something I threw
in the air when I was a kid
yeah when I was 14 you don't think I
ever once through a threw something in
the air and tried to take a picture of
it and call it a UFO they didn't come
out very well but of course I tried of
course I tried
[Music]
who calls me before 8AM
all right
I think I know it is
and my last story how many of you saw
the Tucker interview with Devin Archer
so it was like hours long so I told
myself I wasn't gonna listen but then I
made the mistake of listening to a
couple minutes of it
and if you listen to a couple minutes of
it it does draw you in
and the stuff that I got drawn in on
wasn't even important like it was just
Devin Archer describing the the path of
his life
I would have listened to that all day it
was like this fascinating story of how
an unusually smart kid who got to Yale
and he played some lacrosse I guess but
how does a smart kid who's you know very
uh internationally oriented and willing
to do big things and you know how did he
go from just being smart and playing
lacrosse
to Yale to being in the middle of
History
and there are a few things he knows
first of all he's insanely likable
you know I heard a number of people say
that
and I thought yeah yeah yeah everybody
could be likable that's not really a
high bar right everybody's likable right
but he's super likable
he's like extra likable so the longer he
talks like he laughs at himself for
these self-deprecating but he does
self-deprecating right like he doesn't
do it the cringy way he does it the way
where you're laughing with him
like it's all just kind of weird and
funny
but let me tell you when he was done
explaining the entire sequence of events
that got all the way to Hunter on the
board of Prisma
it all sounded normal and legal to me
isn't that weird it all sounded illegal
to me
now you can say it's uh
um inappropriate
you could say that uh you wish it didn't
happen you could say it's distorting
politics you could say it should be
illegal yeah I'm with you on all that
but when he laid it all out I found him
100 credible
I mean unless he's the world's best liar
but he does not look like a liar he does
not look like a liar not that I could
tell
but I'm just telling you the way he he
presents himself is very honest
good presentation of honesty anyway
and when he was done I saw a series of
events where it was sort of one thing
led to another thing somebody saw an
opportunity you know somebody made a
phone call and the next thing you know
you have the situation but honestly it
all looked legal
I didn't see anything illegal
if everything the Devon Archer says is
true which by the way matches almost
entirely the charges against them
right he wasn't defending him he was
actually telling you the details when
you hear the details you go that's
probably totally legal
so apparently the yeah here's what you
need to know if you're a big company
outside the United States
and you want to get something done that
involves the United States you're
probably going to have to deal with it
in some ways regulatory things or you
know bureaucratic things or you could
have to get something done right you
can't just set up shop
so because our government is somewhat uh
opaque like you wouldn't know who to
talk to you wouldn't know what to do
there's this huge industry of usually
lawyers I guess like Hunter
whose job it is to make sure you can
talk to the right person
that's it you meet the right person to
get something done
now here's the weird thing
I don't think the economy could survive
without it
because it's all these people who would
not be able to do business unless they
could find the right person to talk to
because the bureaucracy would just be a
total stopper you would never get a
license you'd never get anything
approved you'd never get past some
regulatory hurdle
so I do believe that this you know
unseemly
corrupt looking business of people
connecting important people
it might be the only thing that's
keeping anything running
as bad as it is right I'm not defending
it I'm just saying what's your
alternative
wow
all right I have to go yellow somebody
outside my doorway be right back
[Music]
sorry real world I'm having some work
done who shows up before 8 A.M
seriously who shows up before 8 am
without telling you first
well I'm glad they're on the they're on
the job getting the job done all right
that's uh that's all I had today I'm
gonna say goodbye to YouTube
and I will talk to you tomorrow
