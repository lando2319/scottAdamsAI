[Music]
well that's the view
once again outside my window of my
office
that is all smoke looks like we've got a
few weeks more of this
i'm literally in not literally but
figuratively i'm in house arrest
because it is unhealthy to go out there
the
air quality is literally unhealthy
and what does my governor say about that
my governor governor newsom has decided
to go completely
anti-science on this and has decided
that he's going to blame
the forest fires on climate change
now if you know anything about climate
change there are two
claims number one climate change will
make everything
wetter and number two climate change
will make everything drier
i'm not even making that up those are
two claims that i've just
read even this week climate change will
make it wetter
and climate change will make it drier
in the same places apparently and
everybody ignores the the obvious which
is
that the the forests have not been
managed the underbrush has not been
cleared out and anybody could have
predicted
these fires so anybody who was in the
fire
management business could have told you
this was going to happen
without any climate change completely
irrelevant it was still going to happen
well
but that's not why we're here first we
need to do the simultaneous sip and we
need a
cover mug or glass a tank or tell us
just dine a canteen joker flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
when you're in jail
as i am right now can't go outside can't
go anywhere
and it's called the simultaneous davies
if it happens now
go
i do not see the air clearing up well
let's talk about all the things in the
news
i've decided that there are two kinds of
people in this country
people who are trying to work toward
making things better for all people
and people who are trying to stop those
people
now the trouble is people don't know
which group they're in
lots of times people don't know i caused
as i told you i caused some trouble
on twitter by saying something true
which caused people to go nuts
and what i said was that you heard this
a little bit the other day
i said that antifa the original antifa
there were several of them i guess but
one in germany in the 30s
was allied with hitler now of course
all of the anti-fa loving people said
that you
crazy dope you know nothing about
history
in fact it was the opposite of that
don't you know that hitler you know
imprisoned and killed antifa in germany
and that
antifa was against hitler how do you not
know that scott
how do you not know that to which i say
well those things are all true it's true
the antifa and hitler hated each other
it is simultaneously true and here's the
fun part
that antifa and hitler were on the same
side at the same time
meaning that they were both opposed to
the german government
for different reasons but they were both
opposed antifa was
essentially supported by stalin
and hitler and stalin both wanted
a change in the german government for
different reasons
but they were allies in the sense that
they both fought
against a common enemy now could you
think of another example like that am i
overusing the word
ally am i well
let me ask you this if you were to do a
google search
on stalin and russia and the united
states
and their their fighting in world war ii
would would the internet say that stalin
was an ally of the united states
well yes it would it would say exactly
that
if you look it up the word ally will
show up as a
just a common description of stalin
and the united states because for a
while we fought against a common enemy
now if we didn't have a common enemy
which was nazi germany
would we have been fighting against each
other
yes because as soon as the common enemy
was defeated
we immediately lined up against each
other so
it is not a conflict to say somebody is
both an
enemy and an ally even at the same time
so what i really wanted to get people to
understand though
is that antifa the original
anti-fascist organization
defined fascism as any form of
capitalism
that usually they said lay form but it
ends up being the same
so in other words bernie sanders
version of a socialist capitalist system
would be something that antifa in
germany
would have wanted to destroy so bernie
sanders is nowhere
near what antifa wants because bernie is
still a capitalist
he's a you know he's on the edge of
capitalism because he's
he wants a big socialist component
but bernie says directly yes capitalism
yes yes yes totally i want capitalism
bernie's very clear about that but you
know a modified
kinder version in his in his model
so when every idiot says to you
scott don't you understand
anti-fa means anti-fascist
anti-fascist
if you're against them you're obviously
because of the logic you must be for
fascists no can you explain that scott
and part of the fun is making the
pro anti-fa people understand the
fascist
and capitalist even the bernie sanders
version of capitalist
are the same thing because you can't
really have capitalism without
without at least the accusation of
fascism anyway
that was fun um what about that bob
woodward book
that's kind of gone isn't it the biggest
bombshell we had going was this
this bob woodward thing it's
sort of already gone i think you know
there's there's like one little note on
it on the
cnn home page the fox news was done with
it on day one
how do you explain that how do you
explain
that there was a gigantic bombshell this
should be like the biggest piece of news
you've ever heard
and it just sort of disappeared well
here's my explanation
it was never news the bombshell
was that the thing that trump had been
telling us directly
was true that's it
but they the way they told it they tried
to make it into something but it never
was something
because there's such a good record of
trump saying directly yeah
it was very serious that's why i closed
travel it's five times
worse than the flu as he told woodward
serious business and i'm gonna downplay
it because i think this is the way to
play it
and he told the public he was doing it
while he was doing it
that that is the closest to nothing
that anything could ever be now you
could certainly
say i disagree with how the president
handled it that would be
a normal thing people always disagree
with every leader
right on some issues but it is not a
thing to say
that the woodward brook told you
something you didn't already know
there was literally no news there it was
just a retelling of what we all all
every one of us
already knew now how is it that the news
can turn nothing into what they sell as
a bombshell which actually
you know may change voters minds how can
they do that
they can do that because they are
brainwashers
not a news organization if you still
think that the news
is just the telling of facts you're
many years behind the news and
and certainly the social media platforms
uh have for some time time now been just
pure
brainwashing the vehicles
and so they actually brainwashed the
country into thinking
something they already knew was news
and not just news but so important
that you should change the the
government of the united states
based on something that you could just
look at and say um
there's actually nothing here there's
literally nothing here
but they're they're that good all right
brian stelter uh did a piece on talking
about how fox
was downplaying the bombshell and it
showed some
clips of uh fox people saying it was a
big nothing
and i'm thinking to myself that is so
bold
to act as though there's something wrong
with fox
for saying something that is clearly
nothing and you can just look at it and
say it's nothing
they're saying it's nothing and cnn is
reporting it as something wrong with fox
no that's not what's happening here
what's happening is you tried to make
something out of nothing and fox didn't
buy it
that's it um
katherine watson who's uh i guess works
for cbs
she tweeted uh because biden put a lid
on his
his schedule yesterday that sort of
insider language
if you put a lid on it i just recently
learned
it means that the candidate will not be
available for any public stuff
now this close to the election
can you come up with any possible reason
that joe biden would not be available
for the public now i certainly
understand if he had a busy schedule say
meeting with advisors or practicing
maybe a speech or something like that
but the entire day while you're running
for president
the whole day you can't sit in front of
a zoom and take a question make some
news
the whole day nothing because i'm pretty
sure that during
a whole day president trump does a lot
of stuff
and i think he does a lot of stuff when
he's tired
i think he doesn't this is trump i think
he does a lot of stuff
when he doesn't want to because it's a
busy job
he probably does a lot of stuff every
single day on weekends
do you think on a day when you know he's
golfing
do you think he's also not working that
day
no there are no days that the president
doesn't work
so seeing a cbs person saying not sure
why biden isn't doing more to show he
can outwork
trump i have a theory
there might be something wrong with joe
biden
um we'll we'll talk more about
joe biden's issues here in a moment but
um i want to i want to put out this
thought
and i don't know why i'm the person who
has to say this
there's some things that you see in the
world and you say well surely
somebody who will explain this correctly
if i wait wrong
wait long enough okay they haven't done
it yet
but surely by tomorrow somebody will do
a good job of explaining this thing
we're all looking at
so i guess it's up to me because nobody
did it but here it is
it goes like this and i tweeted this
earlier if a hundred well-meaning
protesters
do their protest but in this in the
course of their protest
they are quite aware that they've
created an environment
where just two of the hundred people
just for example
just say two of them caused some looting
and some rioting and some trouble
now the first time that happens you say
to yourself
freedom of speech i'm sure i'm certainly
feeling bad that some bad stuff happened
nobody's in favor of that but
at least we got our free speech and it
was an important issue
the second time they do it if there's
also rioting and some
bad stuff they have to say to themselves
huh i wonder if what we're doing
is making it easy for this other stuff
to happen
we don't mean this to happen but we're
kind of making it easy for it to happen
guaranteeing that it happens now what
happens if you do that process
a hundred times in a row like portland
literally a hundred times in a row
at what point do you say okay
protesters we all got the message so
there's no new
freedom of speech thing happening we all
got the message
but you keep showing up every day
knowing that two of your hundred
might be a different two are gonna burn
down
a big part of the city or cause trouble
or
get somebody killed at what point
do the 98 people who are the good people
they only mean well at what point do you
say that all hundred of them are
well i'm already there i think the
protesters
whether you say 98 of them are peaceful
and i think that's probably about right
what do you say if you look at all the
protests many of them don't get coverage
because they're nothing but
but peaceful so if you looked at
everything
maybe 98 you know if you say it's 99
that's fine but something like 98 are
peaceful
but they're also
not originally not originally originally
they were just
free speech they had a cause they had a
concern
most of them i believe genuinely wanted
to make the world a better place
put that energy out there very american
it's very american to put your energy
out there complain
i'm all good with that but a hundred
times in a row
when people are dying and stuff's going
up in flames that's not really the same
thing
anymore and if you're defending it
at this point you're kind of an
all right there isn't really a way
around that
if you know that you're bringing this
danger with you
even if you don't mean it but you know
it's going to happen because of what
you're doing
you're just an you're not
technically guilty of the crimes
true but you're still bringing them and
you're still an
so let's get that clear um
oh and here's a funny thing that
happened when i tweeted that
on twitter nobody expects anybody to
have a consistent
political opinion you've seen this right
that people will make a claim for their
team
and then the other team will say well
aren't you being a hypocrite
because what about this if you're going
to say that
then though you also have to agree that
it's true on the other side you know in
some other different way
and so people came after me when i said
that the 100 all hundred protesters are
are um they said okay scott
now do police all right let's say there
are only
two bad cops but 98
of the cops are somehow supporting them
you know they're
they're backing them how about that
scott
what do you say to that gotcha gotcha
to which i say no that's an example of a
hundred cops that are
that's exactly the same if a hundred
cops
are consistently protecting two bad cops
that are killing citizens who shouldn't
be killed
yeah yeah they're all you might not say
they're as bad but they're all
in exactly the same way so
i hope that wasn't a surprise to my
critics
that i am completely consistent that if
you're an
democrat or you're an republican
it's still the same to me i'm i'm
completely consistent on that
so there's that
um
the the i i love watching daniel dale
the fact checker for cnn partly because
he he has so many things to fact check
from trump
that he gets he's like the most
overworked uh
he's the most overworked guy on tv
and so he is arguing that
the trump campaign ads that say kamala
harris is in favor of the riots
is not true and his description of why
it's not true
that kamala harris is in favor of the
riots is that when she says
stuff like it's going to keep going and
she says she's in favor of it
she's talking about the legitimate
protests
so it is not true that kamala harris is
in favor of the riots
it's only true that she's in favor of
the things which
guarantee there are riots you see the
difference
right totally different she's not in
favor of
the riots she is in favor of doing all
the
things that guarantee there are riots so
obviously the trump campaign must be
totally lying about that
because those aren't the same
those are completely different come on
obviously supporting the riots there's
nothing in faith nothing in common with
supporting the things that guarantee
you'll get riots
different so that's funny
um also that uh daniel dale claims
that the types of lies that the trump
campaign says
are so outrageous that they and he
acknowledges so daniel dale acknowledges
as
context that all campaign ads
you know have a problem with the truth
we're all on the same side on that right
all campaign ads biden trump doesn't
matter who it is
they'll they'll push the truth as much
as they can
so he does acknowledge that but he says
that the
trump campaign ads are a whole different
level
of bad behavior to which i say
doesn't it depend what you fact check
because
it's the biden campaign that's based on
the most destructive
and divisive lie in american history
there's nothing trump has ever said
that's even
close to the fine people hoax
or even close to saying that the the
president suggested
uh drinking bleach to get rid of
coronavirus
nothing the bi nothing the trump
campaign is
is even in the same zip code with how
evil
just those two things are and those
aren't the only by the lies
they're just the alpha lies that that
are the most impressive lies in american
history in my opinion
i doubt anything has hurt the country as
directly as that lie
so i don't know how you compare lies
and the trump campaign when they were
challenged about the
the veracity of their campaign ads they
responded by saying it's comedy
and you should lighten up
now when you see the trump campaign ads
and they've
let's say they've stretched a point a
little bit to the point where the fact
checkers
you know don't agree anymore when you're
watching it do you watch a campaign ad
like it's true because if you do
you're gonna have to you know you've got
some questions to answer here
if you watch anybody's campaign ad and
say to yourself
yeah i think that's true you should
check yourself right campaign ads are
not
designed to be true they're just
not built that way it's not their
purpose
they have no intention of transmitting
the truth
it's a campaign ad it's a lie by design
every time it's a it's a at the very
least
it's a lie by omission at the least
right it's never going to say well the
other side has some good points too
but uh there's no no comparison all
right
um two police officers in compton
were it looks like they were just hunted
and
uh they're so far surviving i don't know
how bad the shape they are
but they're both shot in the head
they're both shot and they had
they were just sitting in their their
car in compton
and uh somebody ran up and just fired
bullets into it and just
executed them now with that execution
that happened
without the find people hoax
would it did these two cops get killed
because of joe biden and the mainstream
news
creating this division with the fine
people hoax
because in my in my view of things the
fine people hoax
caused all the other hoaxes to be
believable
and caused people to believe that black
people were being hunted
by by police officers uh
and and a lot of the protest energy
comes from that core hoax i would argue
that these two police officers
maybe you don't know if this was just a
crazy person or he had a you know
maybe it was personal you don't know but
there's a good chance
that this sort of thing is directly
coming from the biden
type of lie there's nothing trump does
that does this all right doesn't cause
anybody to shoot a police officer
uh and while we don't know that that was
the direct cause
you could see how it could be i mean
there's there's a pretty direct line of
cause and effect
even if that wasn't exactly what was
happening
my smartest democrat friend
and i mean that literally as if you know
if he took an iq test
he'd do great if you looked at his
academic credentials top shelf
right so literally no joke a smart
smart person told me he doesn't think
that biden's
campaign ads are lies
what what do you do with that what do
you do with that
he thinks only trump lies in campaign
ads
so here's a uh here's a model or a
filter on the world that i think you
should use
i believe that people are walking around
the earth
uh experiencing three different
realities or three different dimensions
if you will
the lowest dimension of of understanding
your reality
is to believe that both of the campaign
ads are telling you the truth
so the lowest understanding of your
of your reality is to look at a biden ad
and look at a trump ad and say yeah
they're both probably true
so i'll you know given that these are
both true i'll pick my
preferred candidate based on these facts
the truth and these campaign ads
now that would be a first dimension
thinker
higher up a second dimension thinker
would be one who says
hey one of these two ads is wrong
i think it's this one and that's where
my
smart democrat friend is he believes
that one's wrong
and one's right a third dimension
thinker
which i hope all of you are becoming you
you're either there or you're becoming
is somebody who understands that none of
it's true
it's not meant to be true it's not
designed to be true
nobody has the intention of making it
true it's never been true it'll never be
true in the future
not either of them and again when i say
not true
that doesn't mean that there are no
claims in them that are technically true
but they're all lies of omission lies of
persuasion
etc so when you are
if you're a third dimension thinker and
you know it's all lies and why
and you're talking to somebody from a
first or second dimension
it's like being a ghost where you can't
actually talk to them have you noticed
that
you know imagine your mind you're an
actual ghost and you're in the room
and people are saying things that are
just ridiculous and dumb and you're
trying to correct them
and you're like no no no yeah but what
about the facts here's my source
and they act like you're not actually
there
they don't argue it exactly
they act it's more like that movie the
sixth sense
where they're doing something
independently and you as the ghost
are trying to interact with them but
they don't have any idea that you even
exist
that's the kind of feeling you get it
doesn't feel like a conversation does it
have you notice that it doesn't feel
like a give and take
at all i just had one of those
on twitter as i do every day in which i
i asked people to give me some examples
of biden lies
because i wanted to see how big the list
was so people gave me some lies but
uh of course a troll came in a bite and
supporting troll
to say well what about the president
saying you should drink bleach and was
some other
claim that he had wrong now so here's
somebody who believed
that he understands the world and has
been watching the news
and that the president of the united
states once
asked about in all seriousness drinking
bleach
or a disinfectant to cure coronavirus
now those of you who have followed me
know that that never happened
that there was a technology with light
uvc light as a disinfectant
that would be injected by a ventilator
type device
into your trachea maybe they could get
it further into the lungs
it was being it was being actively
tested
people talked about it on the internet
it was in the news
and the president asked about it now all
the people who didn't know
that it was a real thing and it involved
uvc light
as a disinfectant the very word that
they use
and injecting the very word that they
use
the the people doing it if you didn't
know that
you'd say oh the president is crazy he
you you he wants to drink bleach
so i send him a source a new source that
describes the company that's doing this
exact thing
contemporaneously with the president's
claim so that you can see he was talking
about a real thing
what did the second generation or the
the what did the two-dimensional thinker
do
did the two-dimensional thinkers say oh
that's new information to me
interestingly
i'd never heard of this and so i guess i
was confused
when the news told me about drinking
disinfectant i believed it
but now that you show me the the clear
fact
i changed my mind did that happen
nope question the quality of the source
now keep in mind that all you have to do
is take the the
name of the company out of that source
and just google it
and you would get you know other sources
saying the same thing
uh so so you didn't have to depend on
the source you just use another source
and i find that the second the
two-dimensional thinkers
will generally either attack the
messenger
well i guess it's the same or the new
source is the same attacking the
messenger
and they don't ever really even address
huh
i guess i had all my facts wrong so
that's why you don't get into any debate
with somebody who's on a different
dimension
so you have to first understand can they
say something bad about their own
team here's a little test for you if you
want to test what dimension somebody's
on
so you say to somebody let's say they're
a biden supporter
let's say you're a trump supporter
hypothetically and you're trying to
determine are they in the same dimension
i am and here's how you do it you say
hey just uh just to see if we're in the
same dimension here
um why don't you say several good things
about trump
and i'll say several good things about
biden
no no criticism at all then when you
criticize trump i'll know that you can
see it in context
and likewise when i criticize biden
you'll know that i can still see the
good qualities
and so maybe we'll have a little
credibility that way
so then i'll go first joe biden very
experienced
joe biden a lot of people say he's a
good guy a lot of people say he has good
intentions
there you go there was those were some
good things about joe biden
i'll even throw in some kamala harris
come there was very smart
uh very ambitious which i happen to like
you know
she gets of course she gets you know
knocked for being a woman if she's
ambitious
but i don't knock her i say that's great
how about more of that
um kamala harris good politician
she has most of the game she needs a
little practice but she has
all the raw materials so there you see
that
that was me operating in the third
dimension saying
there are some good things about this
candidate which i can clearly see
now let me tell you the bad things
and i could do the same thing with trump
if you ask me
hey why do you always say there are good
things about trump
i say uh that's the opposite of what i
do
i say bad things about what he what he
does or has done
all the time i also say that the good
things he does are far bigger than the
the other things not even close so
but i do i do always acknowledge the
mistakes and the the thing that always
amazes me is so people will come at me
and say
but don't you understand the president's
failed the fact-checking 20
000 times what about that scott
acknowledge it acknowledge it and then
you'll be on my side
and then i say i've never denied that
have i ever denied that
not once now of course i would argue
with
lots of individual fact checking but am
i unaware
that the president uses hyperbole and
salesmanship
and persuasion when there are facts that
maybe
don't quite fit the persuasion hyperbole
etc
am i does anybody think i'm not aware of
that
seriously that's that second third
dimension thing to imagine that i'm not
aware of that
and i haven't incorporated that into my
larger thinking
is not even on the same dimension that's
that's a second dimension thinker and
it's like being a ghost you can't
can't have a conversation with a ghost
all right
um here's
here's something that just blows me away
and if this doesn't make your head spin
i haven't done enough work with you yet
that this should be the following topic
should make you feel unmoored from
reality
it's that big but it probably won't let
me test it
it goes like this take your google
page open google and type into the
search box
does joe biden have dementia
what you'll notice is that the autofill
will never fill it
you have to type out the entire sentence
does joe biden
have dementia if you do that you can get
some results
now go to bing or duckduckgo
start typing in does joe biden have
dementia
how far do you get before it autofills
does joe biden have dementia you get to
does j that's right
does and then the first letter of joe
biden
autofills have dementia now
if you're google do you want people to
know
that the entire that the most popular
search
is does joe biden have dementia
now is there any scenario you can
imagine
in which this happened naturally
no no you can't um
and so given that it's public you know
you you can just test it
i i tested it myself i saw somebody
tweet it and i thought i better test
this
because you know it's the sort of thing
you read and then you think i don't know
if this is true
because if it were true it would be a
huge
gigantic example that would be
impossible to question
that's in election interference
is there any way to not define that
as election interference is there any
lawyerly argument and again
i'm being i'm trying to be open-minded
here
if there was if if there were an
argument
for how this is not election
interference
i would mention it even in the context
of saying why i
agreed with it or disagreed with it as
far as i know
there is no argument offered for why
that would be legitimate
can somebody fact check that i'm not
aware of any argument
that says that's natural and if it's not
natural
it's generated by people and it clearly
has
a tremendous effect on the national
consciousness
now if what i say is true
and there's an obvious public
public being the key mind-blowing part
of this
you don't have to do research it's
public it's right in front of you why is
this not
the biggest story in the news
because it's not the biggest story
anywhere
it's the biggest thing but it's not in
the news
why here's why and you're not going to
like it
are you ready we don't form our own
opinions
on politics we don't form our own
opinions we believe we do it's one of
the great illusions of life
we believe that we're looking at sources
forming our own opinions
a little bit of that happens but in
general
you know the big picture is that your
opinions on politics
are assigned to you literally
assigned it to you so if you're watching
more of the news on the right
they'll assign you a certain opinion and
you will adopt it
if you're watching more of the news on
the left they will assign you
your opinion and you will adopt it yeah
there are a few people who can
think through that but it's rare in
general
you are assigned your opinion and here's
here's the part that'll make your head
blow off
the reason that the biggest story in the
country if not the world
is this google manipulation and
brainwashing
the reason it's not the biggest story
is because it hasn't been assigned
let that sink in the only reason
it's not the headline story
is that they haven't assigned it to
anybody
we don't come up with independent
opinions
it's not a thing opinions are assigned
and this isn't assigned and until
somebody assigns it
and says here's your opinion we won't
act on it
and we can't really deal with it
it's like if it hasn't been validated by
the assigners of opinions and i'm not
one
so you know i'm not an official assigner
of opinions
i can tell you about it you can hear it
you can hear all the details you can
logically understand it
you can logically know this is a
gigantic problem
i mean gigantic maybe one of the biggest
problems of
civilization that's how big it is bigger
than climate change
by far it's not even close if if the
citizens of the united states are being
brainwashed
to this extent without their agreement
or understanding what do you agree
that's bigger than climate change
because that would affect everything it
would affect climate change
it would affect whether we go to war it
would affect the economy
it's by far the biggest story
but it's never been assigned to you so
you so you don't hold it in your head as
a big story
and even having heard it from me it
still won't be a big story you will
leave this periscope
and it will leave your consciousness but
if it had been
constantly on the news and social media
it would be the biggest
topic in your mind and you would think
nothing was more important than that
you do not have opinions they are
assigned
to you all right
so if that didn't blow your head off a
little bit i don't know i would
um here are some of the destructive lies
from the kamala harris group
so she's talking about as is the
governor of california that the climate
change is what's fueling and
intensifying the wildfires as i
mentioned
now what is the evidence for that and
i've asked people can you give me some
evidence
that it's climate change causing this
and sure enough they'll send me to a
source
it'll be a source that says climate
change is making this worse
and then i'll say all right now now
connect the dots
i hear the claim but why
and where's your data who was study
shows that it's just not there
so there are people who keep reading the
claim and the claim is in
fairly reputable places so they'll read
the claim
and they won't notice that there's no
connecting tissue to any kind of data or
anything
just some hand waving that you know
might make things drier at the same time
it's making things wetter
and that's basically the argument which
is a non-argument
and then you say well maybe we should
ask the
experts at forestry how many
experts in the country who are experts
at
forest fires and forest management
how many of those people think the
problem is climate change
it's kind of zero it's basically zero
the people who know forest management
say
well just look at it we didn't do forest
management
we got exactly the outcome that that
would predict
which is why there's a thing called
forest management
removing the underbrush etc there's a
there's a reason it's a thing
because it predicts this you know
there's a direct
connection now is it true
that the climate change also has some
impact
i don't know do you know
because if we know that the forest
management piece
predicts all of it could it be that
there is an extra
five percent kicker on there from
climate change could be
i would be completely open to the
argument
that it's a little ten percent worse
because the climate change maybe twenty
percent
but there's no science for that there's
no science for that it's just
maybe maybe who knows
so when you when you see somebody like
harris
um promote a lie that big she's either
completely anti-science which is a
problem
especially since she accuses the other
side of that or
she's telling one of the biggest lies
you could ever tell
which would tell you not to do forest
management
why would you do forest management if
kamala harris
who might be president someday if if a
person this important is telling you
it's
it's climate man it's climate change why
would you do forest management
it doesn't seem to be a variable
according to her
this is the kind of lie that you can't
compare this to anything trump has ever
done
maybe there's an exception that i can't
think of
but the worst things trump has ever said
if you believe them you would still end
up doing the right thing
right so let's say the the worst thing
he said was
there are a lot of rapists coming in
over the border and you say to yourself
that's just a terrible thing to say
maybe i'm not even going to argue the
point but what would be
the downside the downside is we would
get a better border security
and then there would be in fact fewer
rapists coming in because there would be
fewer people
so you don't even need to know what the
ratio of rapist to
regular immigrants is you would end up
ahead
right if you liked immigration of course
so the trump quote lies all have that
quality i think where if you believe
them you'd end up in a good place
the kamala harris ones if you believe
them you end up with a divided country
you end up with california on fire
i don't know maybe you end up being
friends with china while they're trying
to destroy you
all of their lies are the kind that can
kill you
whereas trump's lies are the kind that
oh yeah well it wasn't exactly true but
we came out ahead
and obviously he knew that which is why
he framed it that way
all right i know you want me to talk
about this
there's a post on 4chan
you ready for this okay so the first
part you need to know
it's on 4chan and it's anonymous
so what kind of credibility should you
place on something
that's on 4chan and it's anonymous
the answer is none right so if we can be
honest
let's try to keep some kind of rational
thought here the credibility
should be none what credibility should
you put on the
bob woodward anonymous
or anybody else's anonymous stories
about president trump
zero the same now you could argue
that if you've checked on the anonymous
source and you found out
at least it's a real person that could
have been in the room
that that's a little more confirming
than just a
stranger anonymous stranger on 4chan i
can see that
but it's such a small difference that
you would
it's more rational just say these are
two things
in the category of non-credible things
that said
since it is now the election season and
apparently it's okay
apparently it's okay to say things that
are anonymous
reports uh i will report this to you
with the caveat i wouldn't think it's
credible
but there's something i want to call out
in it there's a detail
in this report it's about biden having
dementia so that it's reportedly
some campaign insider who is now no
longer with the campaign
who reports that it was just common
knowledge that
that biden was on dementia medication
and that the dementia medication would
cause incontinence
and that the real reason they don't want
them answering questions or staying too
long in public
is the incontinence now
again this is something an anonymous
person on 4chan is saying
the odds of anything in that category
being true
not so good right but i'm reading this
thing
and trying to to to answer the question
just my
to my own satisfaction of is it
obviously untrue i mean can you pick it
up by the way it's
told or is there something in there a
tell
a little signal that there might be
something true
and here's what's interesting
there's a detail in this post
that it's hard for me to imagine
somebody would have thought of this
detail
to put it in a fake story and here's the
detail
the detail again is an allegation don't
take any of this as credible
but the allegation is that the biden
team has had
actual literal meetings on the topic of
what kind of
depends undergarment would cause
the less the least amount of obvious
you know visual uh something
but also would crinkle the least
that wouldn't have a crinkling sound now
that
that detail either means it's true
or that this post was created by a
really good liar
a really good liar and you can't rule
out either of those possibilities
because if you were a really good liar
and you wanted to put a rumor someplace
well 4chan would be a good place to do
it right
so i only call out this technique
if you're trying to determine if
somebody is lying about a story
look for the weird detail because a liar
doesn't come up with weird details
they're trying to just give you the most
basic version yes there was a gun on the
sidewalk i picked it up blah blah
but they wouldn't throw in something
like i picked up the gun and it was like
i don't know there was something on it
like
i don't know if it fell in some tar or
it was gum or whatever
so i'm scraping off the gum off of the
gun and it goes off
if somebody tells you a story like that
you say to yourself okay nobody makes up
that story
nobody makes up a story they found a gun
on the ground and there was
some kind of stuff on it i mean
it could be made up but you wouldn't
make up that story
you would make up something that just
sounded more real so anyway the cringe
the crinkle part of the story stands out
as either a very experienced liar
or true but it's definitely not a bad
lie
you can rule that part out all right
here are some of the uh
biden lies that people suggested um
that uh if biden had been president he
could have
prevented all the covet deaths that's
crazy
that biden was for the travel ban
there's some doubt on that one that he
that he was against nafta at one point
and he's four fracking
the fracking one by the way seems to be
a lie on the uh on the conservative side
so here's me just
just take note here when i said that the
campaign ads from both sides
are lies well here's an example this is
just a lie from the
the the trump side so the truth on this
one
is that i think is that joe biden
was against fracking on public uh
government land and so there's a quote
saying that
and then there are other courts saying
he's not against fracking
so i believe that he is he said he is
against it on government land
but he's not going to ban it on in
private
where most of it i imagine happens
whereas kamala harris has said directly
that she's against
fracking but she's the vice president
it doesn't really matter what her
opinion was because she would have to
adopt
bidens now is it
a giant lie not really
because the i think the trump campaign
is let's say in the neighborhood of
truth without being technically true
they're in the neighborhood of truth
because it is fair to say
that the you know the entire pressures
of the base
would cause biden to probably fold and
he would probably become anti-fracking
especially if kamala harris is
anti-fracking
once he got in the job you can easily
imagine
that he's so close to being
anti-fracking
you can imagine his base pushing him
over the line so i would say that's
another example of the biden kin
or the trump campaign or trump
saying something that might be not
exactly true
in terms of the fact checking but it's
it's basically directionally true like
it's
even if even if uh it's not true
it leads you to the right place because
the trump campaign wants you to know
that these are two people who are not
too firm on fracking
in in a party that's very much against
it
and if they get power what are the odds
that biden's
you know weak little complaint that no
no
i only meant government land is that
believable
could you depend on it probably not
probably couldn't depend on that
and so i would say that even though it
fails the fact-checking it certainly
gets you in the right direction
um there's a whole bunch of other lies
here
i won't mention them i asked if anybody
could come up with the first
documented as in the internet documented
case of somebody who had seriously
accused biden of dementia and i wondered
how far back that went
and i don't know for sure but a lot of
people
did some research for me thank you and
there's a mark levin quote
in which he says seriously i think joe
biden may have dementia
and then he goes on to to talk about it
this was
april 28th 2012
eight years ago so
if this stands as the earliest serious
serious question about dementia
i think mark levin gets the award for
the first one to spot it
i would say that biden wasn't really on
my radar back then
so i wasn't looking for it one way or
the other i think my first
mention of it was
somebody says that i mentioned it in
august 27th
of 2019
so that might have been my earliest
mention but there are mentions in 28
2008 that that were sort of semi-serious
so there are a number of people who who
talked about
biden being slow in 2008
and 2009 but they didn't they stopped
short of asserting an actual medical
diagnosis
it was more like it was a little bit
more like just insulting a politician on
the other side
uh he's stupid he's slow he's losing
that that sort of thing
but the actual uh i'm completely serious
i think there's dementia i think mark
levin might have the
the winner on 2012. so think about that
eight years ago eight years ago
a smart observer and levin is definitely
smart
a smart observer picked this up eight
years ago
robin williams in 2008 but you know i i
think a lot of them were just
joking or but i think levin was actually
dead serious on that
um then oh in october 2012
uh dr keith abloh uh
mentioned that that he thought biden
might have dementia or at least it had
to be considered he thought because if
you're a doctor you don't
you don't diagnose people you haven't
met so
dr ablo was more saying it has to be
considered
all right here's a interesting factoid
uh there's data shows that half of the
donations in 2019
for a democratic action group act blue
came from untraceable quote unemployed
donors
and it was uh 400 million in donations
and so the thinking is that maybe these
were
untraceable foreign donations because
in the united states it would be weird
if half of all your donations
were from people who didn't have jobs
i am not sold on this story call me a
skeptic
on this it sounds a little bit too
perfect like a story that you'd see in a
campaign
season here's my problem with it
i don't know if everybody who donates
to every organization gets the same form
to fill out
it would be easy to imagine that the
people
who got donations from this group
had a forum in which the employment
box looked optional i'm just making
something up here to show you that there
are other ways this could be explained
maybe the box was optional or maybe it
was explained differently
you know how important it was or
something like that but
here's a thing you should understand
most people in america don't work
so don't be fooled by the fact that
there was a four percent
unemployment rate at the time these
donations were coming in in 2019
a four percent unemployment rate means
half of the people in the country don't
have a job
did you know that go out in the street
during the work day
any week and the street is filled with
people
the stores are filled with people who
are not working
you know all that the seniors all the
the spouses
who are in between jobs or the other
spouse works maybe one stays at home
which is
working in itself there are students
there are children
i think there are 100 some million
workers in a country of 300 some million
people so i wonder if the republican
numbers are right
meaning that the republicans show only a
like a tiny percentage
don't have jobs but the democrat
donations show that half of them or so
don't have jobs half of them is closer
to real
because if you took all the you know the
retired people etc
who give 10 i think half of the people
would be unemployed in a normal
anything if you had a if a big group of
people
just met across the street from your
house it was just a big public reality
how many people who went to a public
rally have jobs
half about half right if you have a job
you can easily be misled into thinking
lots of other people have jobs
it turns out that having a job it's not
even the majority
most people have had a job or will have
a job but at any moment
most people don't have jobs all right um
here's another fact check from so jake
tapper tried to fact check peter navarro
today i think it was
in which peter navarro claimed that
the biden said it was xenophobic to
stop travel from china and jake tapper
quite rigorously fact-checked them and
said nope
never happened joe biden never said
that the china ban was xenophobic is
that true or false what do you think
do you think it's a true fact that joe
biden
once said that the travel ban
from china was xenophobic
well i went to politifact to find out
here's what politifact says as they rate
it
mostly it's mostly false so politifact
says it's mostly false
that biden called it xenophobic to ban
travel from china
but here's how they word it carefully
listen
to this wording from politifact
so it talked about the situation and
then it says
quote but biden has not directly said
that the travel restriction was
xenophobic
so therefore it's false so politifact
says he has not directly said
that china ban was xenophobic okay but
they continue
he has used that phrase in reference to
trump and his handling of the
coronavirus outbreak
what uh what does it mean
if joe biden did use the phrase against
trump
that it was xenophobic the way he was
handling the coronavirus
outbreak but he wasn't talking about the
travel ban
it happened about the same time as the
travel ban
you know just after it and yet there was
something else that the president did
with that was
xenophobic that didn't have to do with
the travel ban
okay okay
could it be that he was calling it the
china virus or the chinese virus
i think you could say that was maybe
offensive
but is it xenophobic the only
xenophobic thing he did according to
the democrats was the travel ban so yeah
technically maybe he didn't directly say
it
but is is the trump campaign lying
when they say he did say it again
it's one of those directional kind of
things if you were to believe the trump
campaign
you know that they were technically true
and biden said that
he was being xenophobic would you be
misled
would it cause you to make a decision
that's wrong
no no you might be not
technically exactly accurate but you
would be the opposite of misled
you would be led to
joe biden saying that trump is
xenophobic all the time which is true
so that's a weird fact jack there are no
real facts anymore
everything is subjective
i think i have to i have to fact check
this myself
but i think that biden said it was
xenophobic
the europe band so that technically you
could say the chinese band he did not
call xenophobic
that he he called it the in reference to
the the european travel ban
but check that on that i saw it on the
internet but i don't know if it's true
um all right
did politifact give biden's actual
quotes
uh i think he gave one of them i forget
calling it the china virus is accurate
it is
calling it the chinese virus i think is
a problem
because chinese is a word that refers to
the people as well as the government
that's a little unfair no that's totally
unfair it's totally unfair
to blame the chinese people for what the
the government decides to do
but calling it the china virus
is just a description of where it
happened totally fair because we call
the other
viruses by their their place and the
president made that adjustment
you know i don't i say this a million
times
but judging people from what they used
to do
as opposed to how they corrected it just
feels like a loser way to
go through life you know it seems like
the smarter way to go through life
is if somebody used to have an opinion
you don't like
and then they changed it to an opinion
you like you should say well there's an
awesome person
that's an awesome person they they agree
with me that that would be the better
way to go through life
all right somebody says stop it i don't
know what you're talking about
have you ever been fact checked yeah all
the time
incorrectly probably 100 of the time
i think i've been fact checked not by
politifact exactly
i've been fact checked by the news you
know a million times
but not a million times but i have been
fact checked by the news
i don't think they've ever fact-checked
me correctly not once
um well chinese food is not
racist because chinese people eat
chinese food
that's was that an insult or something
can't even drive two hours away from the
bay area to go to a gym
or go for a run yeah the entire state of
california is in smoke right now there's
no place you can drive to
that doesn't look like outside my window
as far as i know
all right just looking at your comments
now
what about the spanish flu um
oh so somebody's saying why was it
called the spanish flu as opposed to the
spain float does it matter
does it matter it doesn't matter because
in the old days
if they were racist in the old days that
was the old days so i don't think we
should use the standard of the early
1900s
for how we name things if if people are
more sensitive today
that's fine by the way i'm i'm never the
one
who complains about all forms of social
correctness
i think a lot of that's useful i think
that
they call it political correctness but i
would call it social correctness
i think that social correctness is
something we should be
tuning all the time you just don't want
to go wild with it you don't want to go
too far
but it's good stuff all right
what will be the october surprise
well the obvious one would be biden
being replaced the obvious one would be
biden being replaced
um you want a bigger one a bigger
saudi peace deal how about some kind of
a saudi
israel deal that'd be pretty big it'd be
pretty big
so somebody says they like my shirt
and my lighting oh the reason you like
my lighting is because i did it wrong
um my lighting is supposed to have the
curtains down but i forgot to put them
down
the only reason the lighting works today
is because there's so much smoke outside
that i'm getting a good lighting effect
all right uh that's all for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
