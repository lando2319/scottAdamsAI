Buffalo
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization and
certainly the best live stream you'll
ever see in your entire life it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and I don't
think there could be a better time in
the entire world
but we can test that we can test the
outer limits of how much fun we can have
and all you need for that is
we fix my mouth for a little bit
all right better all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker tells
the style and the canteen jug of flask
of vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope beans here today the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it's gonna
happen right now
go
oh yeah savor it savor it
locals is working great today
just saying everything's working great
today
um
so while we're talking about all of our
small little problems and all of our uh
complaining about what faces on the Bud
Light can
none of that seems terribly important to
what Elon Musk is doing today
which is describing uh his detailed
plans for occupying Mars
so he's got a detailed plan of how many
Starships he's going to build per year
and how much how much uh weight they can
move and how often they can take off
three per day you know three flights per
day and so he's figured out uh he's
actually figured out
how to bring enough weight to Mars in
terms of you know transporting stuff
that he can actually uh
colonize Mars
apparently we have all the technology to
do that
he's actually sending fleets of ships to
Mars I don't know how he pays for it I
mean if you're the richest man I guess
you can figure it out but
that the the impact of that is just so
enormous
but I don't think I will ever be on Mars
Scott thinks we're going to Mars I don't
think you're going to Mars
cloudy face
anyway I I always get rid of everybody
who says well I'm thinking so upon life
if you tell people what I'm thinking
you get removed so you've been hidden
I'll hide you forever
all right well there's not much to say
about this story except it's so amazing
that it's almost impossible to talk
about that in our lifetime
while you were alive
we were packing up to go to Mars
I mean not personally but don't you
think that you'll visit Mars at least in
a virtual form
oh maybe maybe the signal takes too long
to get to Mars but it seems like I would
at least have an avatar on Mars at some
point yeah there'll be a robot on Mars
that you can just put yourself into it
and walk around on Mars
I'm sure that'll happen
so I might do that but I don't think I'm
going to personally travel there I'm not
I'm not that kind of a adventurer
all right
so the state of Montana
banned a tick tock and the first time I
read this story I read it incorrectly
because I believed it was yet another
state that was Banning it only on
government phones but Montana is Banning
it assuming the governor signs it I
guess Montana is going to ban the use of
tick tock in their estate
now
I have no idea how that's physically
possible or legally possible but the
fact that the state is even trying
is a real good sign
so what would happen if the other 50
states decided to do it and the federal
government didn't
maybe maybe the states just have to
leave this but it feels
like a sign that the federal government
is not doing its job
because if you see the states it feels
like the the main purpose of the states
these days is to embarrass the federal
government into doing what obviously it
should do
you know obviously it should be tougher
on fentanyl so the states went first
right the states were the ones who got
tough with or tried to get tough with
fentanyl before the federal government
tried to push him and same with tick
tock
so that's a that's sort of a productive
use of the states as the Laboratories
they can push the federal government by
doing the obvious things and everybody
says well why is that so obvious for the
state but not for the federal government
leave Tick Tock alone
doko Studio says
are you on China side or our side
all right speaking of that did you know
that India is projected to have and may
already have a greater population than
China this year
does that blow your mind
the India
is now the biggest country
bigger than China population wise bigger
than China
now I thought that it might happen but I
didn't think it would happen this year
that yeah talk about a plot twist right
that's a huge plot twist
so everything that you worried
well let me take you back in time
come back in time with me to the 70s I
think
in the 70s do you remember what we were
all worried about
the adults were worried about
it was that Japan was Rising so quickly
it was becoming such a you know
industrial manufacturing power that
Japan would basically take over all our
industry and the United States would be
left a empty shell of a nothing
well that didn't work out did it it
turns out that you cannot predict the
future of Japan
uh so Japan went into a long sort of
plateau phase they've got a population
problem they didn't take over the world
I think that we were cheating China the
same way
and that China may have so many problems
that when we look at them
we say oh my God they're going to take
over the world and all they care about
is expansionism and uh you know they
want to rule everything now they might
want to do that
but how successful they are is probably
overblown
or how successful they could be
um
yeah so who knows who knows but the fact
that India is at least on paper more
pro-america Pro West
that's a pretty good sign
pretty good sign
um
I wasn't going to talk about this but it
just popped into my head
do you believe that the reason we went
into Ukraine had anything to do with
protecting Ukraine's territorial
integrity
does anybody think that's why we did it
see the weird thing about this is that
we're now fully aware that our
government lied to us and lied to the
world
to start a war
I don't think there could be a worse
crime could there name a worse crime
starting a war that didn't need to be
started and lying to your public about
it and then lying to the world about it
maybe the biggest crime since the
Holocaust or you know or since uh you
know Stalin killed bazillion people or
mal I mean it might be in the top ten
and suddenly I realized how many massive
crimes against humanity there are but
it's probably the top ten of one of the
worst things I've ever seen in my
lifetime
and we're treating it like his business
as usual
what is up with that is that a media
thing
can you imagine a media completely
turning on the government saying whoa
whoa whoa
now that we know that this was all just
a big old money grab whatever it was I
don't know but it wasn't protecting any
any you know property in Ukraine I don't
think
yeah Watergate was nothing compared to
this
but why is it that we decide to be
outraged about some things
but we're not outraged about this
because what would be more outrageous
than starting a war with a nuclear power
on false pretenses
and I can't even think what's worse
there's a distance because it's not
happening in our backyard
probably but I think it's also
that it might work
and when I say it might work
we believe that the real the real
motivations of our government was to
drain
drain Russia of his power
ideally to replace Putin but to at least
drain them of their power I feel like it
might do that
it might drain Russia of its power in
the long run
so it's not entirely clear to me that it
won't work
I wouldn't have done it I don't support
it
but it might work
it's possible you know war is very
unpredictable I will I will agree with
those of you who are going to be
screaming me at me in the comments
Russia is winning the war and Russia
will win the war and there's no doubt
about it because they're just not going
to quit until they do
Maybe
I mean that's not crazy
but anything could happen it's an
unpredictable situation
all right I keep saying on social media
people calling for Budweiser to
apologize
am I missing something about the story
what is it that Budweiser needs to
apologize for
is there a part of the story I don't
know and we know that you know Dylan
Mulvaney is on the on the Bud Light or
at least some special Bud Light bottles
but what would they need to apologize
for
being woke why do they need to apologize
disrespecting his customers they didn't
do that
you think that Budweiser disrespected
its customers
how many how many of their men were
drinking Bud Light
I think the whole point of it was that
Bud Light was not a manly drink because
it was light
right
I've never seen a man drink a Bud Light
in my entire life
I've never seen one adult male human
drink of Bud Light have you I've never
seen it I've never even seen one in the
house
I've never seen one in a bucket I've
never even seen a Bud Light I didn't
even know there was a Bud Light
that's how irrelevant it was didn't even
know it existed
so
I believe it was always meant to be a
woman's drink
I mean Bud Light just screams a woman's
drink doesn't it I mean in our in our
sexist World it screams that
I don't know uh the last thing they need
to do is apologize if there's a problem
the problem is Budweiser's problem
it's not it's not your problem
and I don't think that Budweiser needed
to coddle all of its customers for every
line of business
you know like cross collateralizing them
and making sure that well you don't
drink this you don't drink this beverage
at all
but I don't want to offend you does that
make sense if you're not even the
customer how can you be offended anyway
I don't need an apology but if you do
okay
so I didn't realize that Elon musk's AI
was going to be named x dot a i
or that maybe the app would be named
that and I saw a tweet from
from uh Brian uh romelai who I recommend
all the time on Twitter for the AI and
high-tech stuff
and he's he says that the AI
effort by
mosque is going to be tied into the the
future of Twitter
in other words the Twitter will be the
interface to everything
and you'll just treat it like an AI
so I assume that means you could sort of
tell it to send a tweet you could tell
it to send some money you could tell it
to search a database I don't know who
knows what else we will do but
I would be I'm going to be quite
impressed if uh X the new version of
Twitter becomes an AI company and the
whole Twitter user interface
becomes obsolete in a year
I mean that could happen in a year in
one year Twitter and in fact all of
interfaces the entire interface
you know landscape could be completely
different in here it could be that the
only way you talk to a computer or your
phone is by voice or by texting it what
you want
there won't be buttons to push
okay snowflake nightmare you wasted your
time on that comment I'm going to make
you go away just for using too many caps
hide user on this channel goodbye
all right
um
now what else is happening here we got
uh
so the European Union is worried about
Ai and they're going to make some
regulations and what do you think it is
that they're concerned about well
I believe I warned you this was coming
they're concerned about how AI is going
to use copyright copyrighted material do
you see where this is going
there's an entire industry of artists
who will team up with an entire industry
of lawyers
and they will make it illegal for AI to
use their copyrighted material or even
to borrow from it in material ways
which will make the value of AI Shoot To
Zero
now that's that's the exaggeration but
how much of what you see AI do
looks to you like it might be a
copyright violation
it's a lot
right and and the reason that humans
can be controlled is that if you write a
book and you don't mention that you
copied somebody's stuff
you know they'll sue you
but in the AI world you just ask a
question and you're just all alone in
your house and then it produces
something that only you see
but what if that thing it produces a
copyright violation
Who would know
Who would know because it would be
created locally
nobody would know that you violated
copyright you could tell it to write you
a new book by a different author you
could tell it to write you a new Stephen
King book
and then it would just write one and it
would make a cover and make an ebook and
it would look just like Stephen King
made it you could borrow somebody's art
technique without permission put it
together in in a cover
you know borrow some other treatment of
how to organize the titles which would
also be copyrightable
and it would just massively get around
copyrights for you as an individual
now now the thing that makes a
difference is how quickly and how how
fast that happens how easily it happens
and how undetectable it is so that's
that's the big difference
so I'm going to Triple down on my
prediction that lawyers and artists who
have copyrights to protect people like
me are going to make AI really
trouble
that's not a copyright violation the
there will be an argument that it is
so your argument that is not is is off
point the argument will be made that if
you don't include this as a copyright
violation
there won't be any art by by humans
because all incentive will be gone
all right
um
and then of course lawyers will be
replaced by AI
do you think do you think it would be
legal to do a contract entirely with AI
and no human lawyer
well let me tell you
maybe in the short run in the long run
lawyers will make that illegal
how about having AI as your only doctor
in the short run
sure in the long run the AMA will make
sure that's illegal
because everybody's going to be
protecting their little Turf and they're
going to hire lawyers to defend it so
unless AI gets its own lawyer away AI is
a lawyer
what if AI argued its own case to the
Supreme Court
totally feasible AI could actually argue
its own case at the Supreme Court
that would be weird
wow
oh I just want to correct something the
other day I was talking about a
prediction the AI would have its own
police force and some of you said oh
that's like that movie the Tom Cruise
movie no no that's completely different
Concept in the Tom Cruise movie they use
AI
to have a human police force go get
humans that's not what I'm talking about
I'm talking about the criminals or the
AI and the police will be Ai and no
human will be involved directly the AI
police will go after the AI criminals
and you know trap them and turn them off
so just want to be clear there's no
movie like that there is no movie like
that no it's not Minority Report
unless you're just reminding me of the
movie is not like if what you're doing
is telling me it's not like Minority
Report then you we're on the same page
okay
it's never like the movie
all right
um
so I took a look at the pitch for the
app rewind people were talking about
so rewind is another AI app and what
made this a story is that the founders
put their pitch online so you could
actually see a pitch for investing in
this company and it's really strong
so part of the story is how good the
pitch is
but let me tell you the application the
application is so smart
I'm really impressed with it now I don't
know the details of how it works
technically but here's what it does for
you as a person
so I spend my day looking at all kinds
of content
and listening to people Etc
and what it will do is it'll keep track
of all the things you looked at
so it will know for example if I read a
story about a new technology for
removing carbon from the air
a week later when I want to talk to
somebody about that that story I read
and I can't remember where I saw it I
can just say that the AIA
you know what was I thinking about I was
talking about with and it will actually
reproduce the thing you looked at
so basically it will create a artificial
memory of all the things you consumed
so that anytime you want to call back
something you've consumed in the past it
will easily find oh yeah that if you
remember the topic so you could say what
was that story about UFOs I saw last
month boom it'll pop right up now
browser history Now browser history is
you know one percent of how cool this
would be
now and
Nobody Does that though
nobody's going to go back and look at
all the browser history
they just won't do it and it's not just
browser by the way it's not just browser
so it would be also within let's say you
opened an app I guess the browser will
get all the app pages but uh it'll do
much more than
Tracer trace your uh
treats your history all right Mike
Pompeo is not running for president
after all
I assume that has to do with getting no
support whatsoever
I'm kind of surprised I thought he was a
stronger
candidate than the rest of the public
thought
he lost weight for nothing
yeah well I don't think he had a chance
of winning so he made the right choice
all right there is a new I can't believe
this
there is new dash cam not dash cam body
cam footage of Derek Chauvin who was
convicted for killing George Floyd
and there were two other instances where
he did the same move on black people
who were resisting rest in both cases so
what are the odds that we would not have
seen that until now
how in the world was that not relevant
to the George Floyd trial
wasn't that relevant
yeah so his knee was on sort of the the
top of the basketball of the neck right
now here's the part of the story
that gets interesting
if you knew that he did the same to same
move on two other black people
and let's say that the jury and the
George Floyd situation knew that would
that be further evidence that he should
be punished because he had this trend of
doing this move and every time we saw it
was against black people that would be
pretty damning to a jury or or the
opposite
it showed that he used the same move on
two other people and they had no damage
whatsoever
no damage
zero zero lasting damage nobody was
killed
doesn't that prove that whatever
happened with Floyd probably wasn't
the move
yeah don't don't you think that the
existence of those two things
should be maybe something his lawyers
should be taken up
the fact that we have evidence he used
it twice because remember
the the major part of the case if I
under if I understand this correctly
the biggest central point of his
conviction is that he would have
obviously known this could kill him
right the the entire thing was based on
did you know this would be dangerous
well if he's done it in the past in you
know maybe more than these cases that
are on a video he's probably done it a
bunch of times
in fact he was doing it on video right
in front of a whole bunch of other
officers who were just standing around
watching had no problem with it at all
I would think that if I saw those videos
as a juror I would say to myself
Derek shofen may have been doing the
wrong technique in the police department
should deal with that right so if he's
using the wrong technique or he's
trained wrong I mean that's a separate
question but in his mind was that
dangerous
and my answer would be it looks like
it's something he does every day so no I
if I were a juror I would say he's now
proven by multiple uses that these
people were fine of course he would
think that George Floyd would be fine of
course he would
why wouldn't you because remember the
two people he used it against allegedly
not allegedly because it's on video the
other two people that they used it
against was a very slight you know a
skinny black man a young skinny black
man not nearly as big as George Floyd
and a woman
and neither the skinny black man or the
woman
were you know injured in a permanent way
now I believe one of I believe the man
was yelling the same way that Floyd was
like you're killing me you're killing me
and then he was fine
so
probably every time a police officer
does that kind of a move which you know
maybe they shouldn't do but probably
everybody says that you're killing me
you're killing me so if George Floyd was
saying it was probably the tenth time
he's heard somebody do that
and he would just think yeah that's what
everybody does
Reuben Tobias what made you hate black
people
in all caps I assume you're joking don't
hide you on this channel anyway
um
all right
LOL come on man
yeah they all yell about the cusp being
too tight and you're hurting my arm and
that seems to be basic stuff
I can't breathe I think they say I can't
breathe when you handcuff their arms
behind the back
yeah so this is trouble you can't if
you're a police officer how would you
know if anybody's being serious
uh watch the full video he was not
applying pressure well you can't really
tell anything from videos
the one thing we know is you can't tell
from the video
do you ever watch uh NBA replays where
they're trying to determine if a foul
occurred and even you can't tell from
five angles
you know even the experts will be
watching okay let's watch it from this
angle oh
well I'm not sure if that hand actually
hit him in the cheek or not it was close
I can't tell the videos are really tough
to tell so if you think you know maybe
maybe you don't know
all right so we mentioned this before
but it's getting weirder and weirder
which is
um apparently male sperm has declined
for 50 years in a row
50 years in a row
how in the world
do you explain that
well if it's diet it wouldn't have
started 50 years ago would it do you
think 50 years ago the diet was so bad
that it that's when it's I think 50
years ago the diet was the same as it
was 70 years ago
I feel like it's the last 30 or 40 years
where the diet got terrible
or was it processed foods maybe
vaccinations maybe maybe fluoride maybe
soy maybe the food pyramid maybe
everybody's fatter
well one of the theories is men are less
active men do less physical labor and I
think that's part of it
I mean if we know that physical exercise
increases your testosterone and people
are sitting around more that's part of
it but that would explain why it's
falling for 50 years in a row
it's got to be food
what could it be if not food
right
it's got to be food
wouldn't you love to see an experiment
or here's what I'd like to see there are
some people
who eat right all the time not many very
few people wouldn't you like to see a
comparison of the people who have been
eating rice since they were teenagers
with the people who have never tried to
eat right and then adjust by weight
because there'll be some cases where
they're the same weight you know some
people eat poorly but they they're not
they're not fat so I'd like to see two
people like equal you know body mass
index one of them eats a lot of
processed food one eats you know organic
food
just see if there's a difference I
imagine it would be a big one yeah I
worry about soy I don't have any science
behind that but I worry about it
sedentary lifestyle Maybe
Maybe
but don't you think that the low
testosterone is primarily the cause of
low birth rates
so I'm going to go contrarian on you if
I were to ask you why the birth rates
are lower you would give social reasons
and economic reasons you would say we
can't make enough money you say men and
women aren't as valuable to each other
you can give all these social reasons
why things are different socially and
economically and I'm going to give you
my counter argument
if your body chemistry told you to bang
babies you would go do it
no matter how stupid it was
no matter how stupid it was you would go
making babies if your body was telling
you to do it if your testosterone is low
your body isn't telling you to do it I
mean I might enjoy the experience but I
don't think it's driving you in an
evolutionary biological way like you're
gonna die if you don't make a baby you
know get in there every chance you get
you gotta get in there
yeah I believe that the low testosterone
is the direct cause of lower lower
family making and baby making
that's that's my
ulterior hypothesis
what do you think you buy that I think
all the social stuff looks like it's the
reason but it's the outcome of people
not having the right chemistry if we
have the right chemistry we wouldn't
care how much money we had we'd just be
making babies
because the chemistry would over
override your mental process you're
meant if your mental process is telling
you to have a baby your testosterone is
too low
let me say that again
if you're if your brain is involved in
whether or not you're having a baby
let's say you're an adult and you're
married if your brain is what's involved
as an well okay I think my income will
be this much and a kid costs this much
hmm I think I'll only do one because I
can't afford a second
I believe that if you put women on birth
control
and then you lower men's testosterone
they'll they'll use their brain
to decide whether they want a baby
but if you took away all the the
chemical uh impacts they would say I
don't care if I have enough baby I don't
know I don't care if I have any money I
don't care if I have enough time I don't
care if the world is everything from
climate change I'm just gonna have some
babies
that's my understanding of human nature
all right
Bill Maher
can see half of the field
and sometimes more of it so he impresses
me
as being unusually open to arguments on
all sides but he has this weak spot
which I'm going to call out so he does
point out that the Democrats are
probably misjudging the whole Stormy
Daniels situation if they think it's
going to stop Trump they might be wrong
and Bill Maher points out that to the
public it's going to look like Bill
Clinton's situation with Monica Lewinsky
and apparently Clinton had the highest
ratings approval ratings he's ever had
after everything came out with Monica
Lewinsky his approval went up
because it looked like he was being
unfairly attacked for something that
wasn't necessarily too related to
governing
so it just seemed like an unfair attack
that's what the Stormy Daniels thing
looks like it looks like it's not
related to the law it looks like it's
not related to governing it looks like
just a way to get one guy
so Bill Maher's war is warning that the
Stormy Daniels attack might make Trump
more popular
do you agree
do you think the Stormy Daniels legal
Jeopardy
will make him more popular
I think so
now it won't make him less popular
that's the part I'm sure of it won't
make him less popular if it makes it
more popular it might be temporary or a
little bit but it certainly plays into
his narrative perfectly that that the
Democrats are evil and trying to hunt
Republicans and he's just the one who's
standing in the way so it very much goes
to his own narrative
however here's where I'm going to
disagree with Bill Maher and I think
he's got a gigantic blind spot
or I do to be fair I can't tell the
difference right so one of us has a
giant blind spot but I'll let you be the
judge
so what Bill Maher says is you know he's
discounting the stormy thing as as
useful for getting rid of trump which it
looks like he'd like to do
and he said but Democrats didn't have to
do this meaning pursue the stormy thing
Trump commits real crimes
now what are the real crimes
what are the real crimes that Bill Maher
says Ah ignore those not real crimes go
after them for the real stuff okay
here's the real stuff
he pressured state election officials to
fix an election on tape
Is that real
it's not even close to real
he literally said find votes in the
context of thinking they were miscounted
there's not a single bit of evidence
suggesting he didn't believe there was a
miscount he did believe there was a
miscow he completely believed it and he
believes it now he has been completely
consistent from day one that the
election was miscounted so when he asked
them to find votes there's no jury in
the world no jury in the world is going
to think that was anything except
wanting the vote to be counted correctly
because he thought it was miscounted
now
how would you get how would you ever get
12 jurors
to think that find the votes
means inventive Oaks you're not going to
do that that's not a thing and maybe in
this yeah maybe in Atlanta
um and how about he refused to concede
the elections and thereby incited
Insurrection what
it's perfectly legal
perfectly legal to refuse to concede an
election that is not a crime and if on
top of that you encourage your
protesting supporters to be peaceful
that's doubled not a crime that is
closer to trying to prevent a crime
he's guilty of trying to prevent the
crime by telling his people to be
peaceful
that's the worst that is guilty of
trying to prevent a crime based on the
information
now do you think that Bill Maher
actually sees these as legal Jeopardy
do you think that it is real private
moment he thinks oh we've got him now
can't wait to get to the good stuff
now he didn't know he didn't mention the
uh the Box hoax
yeah the boxes at Mar-A-Lago which makes
me suspect that Bill Maher does
understand that the Box stuff is BS and
then it won't I mean it won't amount to
anything or if it does amount to
something it won't be any worse than
what Joe Biden's looking at
so
I feel like Bill Maher is capable of
seeing almost the whole field but but
when Trump is involved he imagines that
there's a crime when there's not not
even close to it I mean if if this were
a toss-up I tell you if this were a like
a jump ball or a 50 50 maybe it's a
crime maybe it's not I can't tell but
it's nothing like that this is not even
in the general zip code of the Wright
County to be a crime and I can't believe
that
that's not obvious to somebody as
open-minded as Bill Maher
because he does genuinely have a
functional brain you know unlike a lot
of people who you know do his kind of
work he actually can consider all the
points
yeah which is strange and beautiful at
the same time
all right um here's what California is
proposing to do with our energy bills
they're going to make the amount that
you pay for your electric bill based on
your income
oh my goodness it's like California is
trying to drive out anybody who would
pay taxes
can you imagine me staying in California
if I have to pay for everybody else's
electricity which is what they're asking
and also have to pay reparations
are you kidding
I mean it's like it's almost like a joke
now it's like they're actually trying to
find one reason after another to make
anybody leave who is white or Asian
American and Rich
you know including Indian American I
guess
so
it's just insane
yeah and they're doing it in the name of
you know Equity of course and you know
making sure that uh everybody gets
electricity and that's good
I want everybody to have electricity but
do you know why the electricity costs so
much
what do you think that was my fault
am I responsible for California's
electricity because I I made a lot of
money
no
California closed their nuclear plants
and they didn't build new ones
California screwed this up and they're
giving me the bill
California
screw this up and they're assigning the
bill to me
probably because I'm white
so to me this looks like uh racism
because if you were to look at the
number of people who are going to pay
more for energy and then you look at the
people who pay less under this plan it
is very clearly skewed toward low income
which is
for other reasons skewed highly toward
people of color
so this is a purely racist change
and it literally is just shifting the
burden from one one selection of races
to another
primarily I mean obviously individuals
are lots of exceptions but the racial
impact of this is huge isn't that is
this not a huge racial
um yeah it's like it's like stealth
reparations
speaking of which I tweeted this because
I never I never really thought of it
this way but you know what Collective
punishment is right
it's a war crime
so Collective punishment would be if you
uh if you're in a war
and instead of just shooting the enemy
combatants you decide to punish
everybody in the town because they let's
say they protected the people you were
trying to get
so you want to make sure the next town
doesn't protect any of their enemies so
you just kill everybody in the town
so that the next town gets the idea that
even if you're not in the military we're
going to get you to so that's Collective
punishment now it doesn't have to be
limited to killing I just use that
example so anytime you're if any time
you're punishing the population
for the actions of some specific number
of people that's called Collective
punishment
and it is generally considered either a
war crime if it's in a war or at least
unethical and immoral would you agree
that that it's a moral I mean obviously
immoral
but my problem is that that's what
reparations are
given that the the people who are the
victims the direct victims direct
victims are no longer with us and the
direct
cause of it you know the the slave
owners and Traders are no longer with us
so my family
is descended from people who either
weren't here just weren't even here
when any slavery happened or they were
on the side of the north meaning that
they were actually fighting and dying to
end slavery among other things
so
in my opinion reparations are collective
uh punishment
because it primarily would punish people
had nothing to do with anything
and I don't believe uh and the argument
that I got against this
um
the argument against it was no Scott
reparations are different
do you know what that is
that's word thinking
they say well wait a minute wait a
minute the words are different so
therefore that's the end of my
conversation now reparations is a
different word
than Collective punishment so once one's
reparations and the other is collective
punishment so therefore they're not the
same because words are different
that that's actually the best pushback I
got is that the words are different no
you're missing the point the concept is
the same I know the words are different
I understand the words are different the
concept's the same you're punishing
people and it is punishment by the way
it is punishment
because
um well it just obviously is it's it's
not just money owed it's punishment
and the reason that any anybody who is
you know potentially going to pay
reparations the only reason they would
consider it
is because some feeling of guilt and
some feeling that they should be
punished
that if you punish if you punish the
innocent people enough
the other people will feel better so
we've got to we've got to punish more
innocent people who had nothing to do
with anything by taking their money
all right
so
um yeah that's going to be my standard
of reparations Collective punishment is
immoral and I'm not really going to
debate it more than that
Collective punishment is immoral
all right
um let's talk about fentanyl so the news
is that allegedly the Biden
Administration is getting super serious
about going after a fentanyl
now there are a whole bunch of things
involved here including
um
a bunch of uh was it indictments against
uh the Sinaloa cartel the kids of El
Chapo I guess there are three kids of El
Chapo who took over the operation
and so he's going to go after them he's
going after dozens of other people
they're going after Chinese precursor
chemical makers they've got rewards
really big rewards like multi-million
dollar rewards for information on the
conviction of 27 individuals including
high level members of the sinloa cartel
now here's my question
is any of that real
because it doesn't feel real
none of it feels real
meaning that I don't think we have
access to any of those people
and there's nothing we can do in China
right
so it looks like window dressing to me
I'll tell you what would look real
we've sent our special forces to the
Border we gave Mexico 48 hours to turn
off the fentanyl trade and at the end of
that we're gonna we're just gonna mow
the lawn
you know not as not as innocent people
of course but we know where the cartel
operations are and we're just going to
destroy all of them for as long as it
takes forever
it's a permanent War we're going to blow
up everything that looks like fentanyl
forever now that would be serious
that would be serious
but indictments about people we can't
get a hold of
I don't know that doesn't seem too
serious to me honestly uh it looks like
they're just preparing for the election
so they can say oh yeah we did a bunch
of things look at us doing all these
legal things on paper
look at all the paper we moved around
our paper is awesome
but it's just going to be paper
I don't see anything real
that's connected to what they have
announced so I'm going to say uh it
looks fake to me
it doesn't look real at all we do have
El Chapo
but suppose we caught two out of three
of his sons it wouldn't make any
difference
suppose we caught all of them it
wouldn't make any difference there's
always somebody who's next in line
right if we get 27 people I don't know
that that would make any difference
so if it's not the people you need to
just blow up all their assets
and anywhere you see them like if you
saw an armed band of Sinaloa people it
wouldn't matter what they're doing
Just Kill Them All
I mean that would look serious but I
don't think any of that's going to
happen
unless a republican becomes president
and then there's a good chance
with the Republican president I think
there would be actual physical action
now what do you think we can do to
anybody in China
what in the world how in the world is
that going to help because China is
obviously just ignoring us on this and
doing their little workarounds that make
no difference at all
right
well
that is my rant for the day is there
anything I'm missing today
so let me answer Don's question
the War on Drugs do you believe that
comparing uh fighting Fentanyl
is analogous to the War on Drugs you
have to just say no do you think those
have anything in common other than
there's a drug involved I would say
there's nothing in common
that would be the worst reasoning of all
time is that the drug war hasn't worked
yet
that is not a logical or reasonable
argument
because there's because there's been
nothing like this
and we've never attacked we've never
attacked a militarily attacked a country
um to get rid of their drug operation
we don't know if it'll work
but you can't say that we already know
it won't
did I forget to take my medicine
now I'm actually in my correct mind
today
I heard somebody say that San Francisco
is actually much better than Twitter
says it is
anybody been to San Francisco recently
because there's a big there's a little
bit of pushback
that the streets are actually safer than
you think and then other people say no
it's a hellscape
but but if somebody been there recently
have you walked around there recently
yeah well Bob Lee was killed by
something he knows is it was his
sister's boyfriend
allegedly
certain areas yeah okay
um
well the cash app developer wasn't
killed because it was San Francisco
he was killed because
um it was just a personal thing
had nothing to do with any Street crime
Don Dodd JR says stop the bud boycott
I agree with that
who disagrees we should not be
boycotting but you know because remember
I got canceled
so I don't think I should have been
canceled and I don't think Budweiser
should be canceled
I think I think it's some at some point
you just gotta let people you know let
the free market do what it does
a homeless man said he was going to get
a gun and come kill you
and I almost lost my temper and threw
him into traffic
oh my God
yes I saw it I saw I was quoted
um
declaring a war all right
you're not going to make me watch the
movie sicario because it reminds you of
something that's happening now that I've
talked about
I'm not going to watch the movie to
learn something right that doesn't work
now I'm not going to watch the movie to
try to learn what's going to happen in
the real world
that will not help me
um
do you feel more liberated oh my God yes
yes Julian you keep saying that and I
keep telling you I'm reading it so you
don't need to keep saying it over and
over again all right I'm going to get
rid of you now for saying that after I
said that
all right goodbye
um
I'm not gonna watch a movie
do you know when was the last time I
watched an entire movie from beginning
to end
I don't
years probably years
uh oh Maverick you're right yeah I did
watch top top gun Maverick that was that
was the only movie I watched
the entire movie
four years maybe five years
Elon Musk said San Francisco's unlivable
I do believe that
I also think I've never seen anybody
drink Bud Light I have no memory of it
that's the only thing I know
um
what's that
really good about Ai and Quantum
Computing okay the Dave show
I have not read the shallows
all right how many of you are afraid of
AI
do you think AI is going to be a risk to
civilizations
um I think no
yeah I I think that well let me put it
this way I need to be more clear with my
language I believe the risk is real and
though Elon Musk says about potential
destruction of civilization is a real
risk I believe that's a real risk I also
think it's small
and I would bet against it quite heavily
so I believe that we will get our you
know we'll we'll put so many limits on
AI
that the biggest risk is that we
it
and it becomes useless
so far I'll tell you what it looks like
it's developing
so far it looks like AI will be tools
that humans use
and that's it
at least for a long time
I think that's all to be just better
tools and nothing else will look
different
if you think about it we could have made
the same argument about the internet
I'll bet somebody did about when the
internet first you know was in this
nascent form I bet people said oh
there's a risk This Will Destroy
civilization
because you know the the governments
will lose control of the narrative and
and rumors will spread and then somebody
will put a bug in the internet and since
the internet is connected to everything
it will turn off everything in the world
and we'll all die
I suspect without doing the research I
suspect
that we had exactly the same level of
fear about the internet itself
am I wrong about that
was there anybody who sort of was around
during the beginning of the internet
when people were talking about it okay
I'll give you another analogy
when
um when I first was a banker
I worked at Crocker Bank in San
Francisco and Crocker Bank was famous
for being uh first I think they were
first maybe on the west coast first to
put in ATMs
and believe it or not that was
considered uh a company risking risk
that people were afraid that the ATMs
would drive all the customers away
because they would want personal service
and they wouldn't trust the machines and
then the machines would steal some money
and then people would have to have a
machine stole your money and then you
wouldn't be able to make a claim against
it because you couldn't prove it but
basically it was every fear in the world
about the ATMs
now 35 years go by
how much trouble have ATMs caused for
banks
none I mean nothing out of the ordinary
right
so it's pretty common
that we think the new technology is
going to end the company or the world
do you remember when television came in
and all the smart people said well
there's the end of radio
I mean who's going to be gathering
around the radio or do you have
television
but radio is bigger than ever
because it didn't go away in cars and it
just changed for him and blah blah blah
so
that's my prediction the AI definitely
does have a risk of destroying
civilization that that's a real risk
but it's small
and I think we'll be fine
transforming art and negates copyright
copyright might go away
it might
yeah I this is the first time I've
genuinely been wondering what I'll do
for a living you know for the next
number of years
because I think just everything's in the
air and for Creative people you know
people who do what I do how long will I
be able to be AI creating comics
now to the earlier question now that I'm
canceled
I can do much better Comics they're
they're much better by the way for those
of you who haven't seen the new Dilbert
Reborn
can those of you who are reading it on
the subscription site locals
because I think there are some of you
watching on the uh on the other feet as
well so for those of you who seen Dover
reborn can you confirm that it's better
than the old Delbert
yes or no is it substantially better now
the locals it's all yes it's just a wall
of yes because they get to see it but
some of some of you have seen it and you
can see the comments like it's all yes
the same well you haven't seen this week
then if you say it's the same
this week was definitely not the same
yeah and then robots read news my my
alternative comic I'm making that even
sharper
so
in my opinion my my ability to create
art that people want to see is at an
all-time high
who predicted that who predicted that I
would be creating my best art exactly at
the same time AI
is coming into existence
now I've seen I've seen a number of
examples where people try to show me
that they got AI to write a joke
have you ever left an AI joke
not yet
you have oh no you haven't I don't
believe that
all right
um
so at the moment I still have some very
large advantage on AI for what I do
but I don't know I don't know what the
nature of that Advantage is
what I think it is is that I can more
quickly tell what isn't funny
and I can more quickly tell what is a
non-standard way to say something
and then I've got a whole bunch of
little rules in my head
for what makes things funny that you
know I've never written down but I just
kind of know after a while the AI might
not know
because people who do humor for a living
are unusually terrible at explaining how
they do it have you ever noticed that
it's probably the one thing you can't
explain
if you ask an athlete how they do what
they do you might not be able to
reproduce it because you don't have
their body but they can tell you exactly
what they're doing I mean Tiger Woods
will say all right here's how I practice
this is what I do you know the whole
system but if you're
if you're a humorist
you can't really explain it
you don't know why it works you just
know it's funny when it does and so your
brain kind of goes there automatically
and you don't know where it went you
don't know why it went there but you
know that's where the humor is so there
is a mysterious part about it that the
AI would have trouble learning because
nobody can explain it
and I don't know that it could pick it
up from pattern alone
because so far it hasn't if it could
pick it up from pattern
I think it could already be funny so
there's something that's not in pattern
that's unique to humor because they can
pick up programming it can pick up
language
you know opinions it can pick up all
kinds of other patterns but it is failed
completely to pick up humor patterns in
a way that they can you know format
themselves
so I don't know why it's just some kind
of a pattern that's not obvious or
nobody's explained it
to the AI yet
data had the same problem yeah data had
the same problem on Star Trek
humor is language with a brain
you know how the exact wordings of a
joke makes the difference
I think you've noticed that right you
can imagine that I would do exactly the
same joke with three panels and it would
say exactly the same thing but just
worded differently and you know it
wouldn't be funny
there's a specific wording
that makes something funny and and
nothing else does and part of it is that
the way humans use words they're also
foreshadowing all right here's something
that
um I've never seen AI do in a joke and
I've explained it a number of times it's
when when you complete the job I'll give
you an example so one of the Dilbert
reborn jokes I've talked about this one
before
was that uh Dilbert's on a date and the
date asked Dilbert
um how many sex partners have you had
that's something I wouldn't have done
before I got canceled
and uh Dilbert s in return does that
include robots
and the day says yes
and then Dilbert answers one
no no computer could write that joke
because what I did was I know how your
brain works and so I gave you just
enough of an answer that you would
complete the joke in your head
and the way you completed it was oh my
God the only one time he's ever had sex
was with a robot
or just as funny
he did have sex with a human
but he's not making the distinction
between human and robot sex which would
be a very alarming thing for your date
so so the reason that joke works is that
I make you do the work right I make you
complete the joke in the funniest way
for your own mind is it funnier for you
that he had sex with a robot and he
wants to count that or is it funny or
that he doesn't make a distinction
because pretty soon he's going to be
cheating on you with a robot
like your your brain just completes this
entire tree branch full of possibilities
with just with just one word when dilber
says one
now how would you teach AI to do that
and and that's just one element of humor
like that's just one little corner it's
not the way you do it all
but how would you teach that
now here's another thing that I do
routinely
I'll do a joke where something is used
something that's typical is used in a
non-typical way like a like a demented
engineer found a way to use something in
the wrong way
um
yeah I see somebody putting putting one
in you know an example of the AI uh
humor doesn't work
um
AI will appear to perform be able to
yeah I don't know if Nuance is exactly
the word
I I guess it's this here's my
simplification
the thing that makes humor work
is that there's part of your brain that
um
tries to make logical something that's
not logical
right now I don't think you've ever
heard it explained that way
the laugh reflex is because something
wasn't logical or didn't make sense
but it made sense but it doesn't make
sense
does that make sense
there's a famous uh
Far Side comic where there's a murder
and you see the inspectors there and the
body is still there and the murder was
in a clock store and every one of the
clocks has a bullet hole in it and all
the clocks stopped at the same time
because I got shot with bullets
and the investigators are sitting there
with all these stop clocks exactly this
time of the murder like I wonder if we
can figure out when this murder happened
or something like that
now
why that's funny is that it's logical
like they're trying to figure out when
the murder happened but in the most
illogical unlikely case every one of the
clocks was shot
like why would you murder somebody and a
managed to put a bullet hole in every
clock in the store right so when your
brain tries to
put together the the logical part which
hey just look at the clocks and they'll
tell you when the crime happened where
the illogical part that somehow every
clock in the store was shot and stopped
like like your brain can't quite
reconcile it and then you laugh
now you're laughing because they're
being stupid
but it's really because you can't
reconcile it just being stupid isn't
funny enough because you could write
those jokes all day
there was a guy who went to the store
and he thought he was buying a uh some
donuts but because he's dumb
he he bought some uh some paper plates
and then he ate them because he's dumb
get it get it he's done
see he went he went to buy a donut
but because he's dumb he bought some
paper plates and then he tried to eat
them to get it
so so the dumbness of the inspectors in
the clock shop is not the joke
because you could write dumb people
jokes all day long that wouldn't be
funny it's it's dumb because it doesn't
make sense that all the clocks were shot
at the same time like that's the part
that makes it funny
all right
um Dad humor dad humor is a one of my
favorite genres
because it knows that you're going to
grown at the joke
and it knows that the level of
cleverness is sort of uh you know is not
a hundred percent
is sort of like the 75 clever like it
you know that it needs to be more clever
but somehow it's funny because it's not
yeah
yeah sometimes dad jokes are funny
because they were sad
does that make sense
it's not funny because it's funny it's
funny because you would you would
actually say it out loud
it's the second out loud that's the
funny part it's not even the joke it's
like did you really say that out loud
like those words actually came out of
your mouth right now see that's what
makes it funny
is that you're saying something that
shouldn't come out of your mouth so it's
the incongruity of you saying it and you
shouldn't say it is what makes it work
it's that incongruity thing now I think
that's what the the AI can't get it
can't get human incongruity and it
doesn't know that's where the joke comes
from
because the AI is going to try to make
everything make sense right
ai ai is too on the nose
okay we do this because it makes sense
and then the natural result of that is
this which makes sense from the natural
cause and effect of that thing
so far
AI fails by trying to be logical
and you can't be logical and all fit
together and still funny it's the
incongruity of logic or incongruity of
reality but almost reality that makes a
funny that's what the reef the laugh
reflex comes from
um
your underestimating AI well I'm not
underestimating it at the moment because
I can observe that it can't do this
but I'm definitely not underestimating
what it could do in the future
because what it could do in the future
is all of that I believe it could do all
of that in the future but it doesn't yet
know that the logical incongruity is the
joke
I just don't think anybody's taught it
that
maybe it could learn that
uh
the Wise Fool archetype you have to
think about that
uh
Germans also love Hasselhoff okay I'm
sure that comment had something to do
with something
yeah
so
all right that's all I got for now I'm
gonna go uh enjoy my day
there's a pretty good chance that I'm
going to do a man cave
live stream tonight
pretty sure it would be earlier tonight
probably
oh there's a good point I'm seeing a
comment on locals that AI doesn't have
access to our private conversations are
you sure about that
um I believe you but but it has access
to only public writing but public
writing has a lot of humor in it
hmm
yeah but I can see how it wouldn't get
conversational humor because that does
conform more to ordinary people talking
to each other casually and you don't see
that in in written humor too much
oh somebody talked about Ai and freedom
of speech
I hadn't even thought about that
what happens if AI starts getting
canceled for its freedom of speech
I guess I will happen won't it
why wouldn't it because you're not going
to get away with letting your AI say the
thing you can't say
can you imagine oh maybe this is the end
of wokeness oh work with me I just had
an idea
I'm now predicting the end of wokeness
and it goes like this
hey Scott what do you think of
reparations I think reparations is a
fine idea because of the pain and
suffering of the past I think that the
white people who were born today and had
nothing to do with it absolutely should
pay because of systemic races and all
the reasons
however my robot is kind of an
you don't want to hear what my robot has
to say about this topic do you I I can't
shut up no no all right
make it fast maybe fast and then the
robot says all the things that you
really believe
you say look at that oh
I am going to have to reprogram this
robot it seems to be getting more racist
every day
and therefore
the end of wokeness
you're welcome
we can finally see the light at the end
of the tunnel people
wokeness has a timer on it
as soon as my robot can tell you what
it's thinking totally independently of
me I mean robot well
uh then everything's fine and I will
never leave the house without my robot
next to me
um I got a question for you Scott well
let's hear the question I'll see if I'll
handle this myself or maybe turn it over
to my robot
who is a completely independent entity
um and don't blame me for what the robot
says the robot is sentient
I think the robot should have rights am
I right robot yeah robots robot agrees
with me
um
Iron Chef says I want a robot so I can
come home from a bad day and smack it
around
there you go
all right
James O'Keefe is killing it with his new
gig which is completely banned on social
media apparently
because uh
don't you think James O'Keefe is
suppressed somehow on social media
because I'm not seeing a lot of his
stuff even though I know he's doing some
you know provocative stuff it's like he
just disappeared you have to go look for
him which I've done a few times I've
gone and looked for them but he doesn't
just normally pop up on anything I see
on Twitter
all right here's a comic strip about yay
all right that's not funny
he went after Dylan
wait who did who are we just talking
about who went after Dylan
or James O'Keefe went after Dill why
would James O'Keefe go after Dylan
I think we should leave Dylan alone
what do you think do you think we made
we meaning everybody who talked about it
do you think we made too big a deal
about one person on a on a beer can that
you can't even buy
I mean remember that beer can wasn't
even for sale
it was never meant to be for sale
I I just
I think I am following OMG and I still
don't see it but I'll check on that I
might not be following it I thought it
was I would have if I'd seen I could
follow it I would have clicked it
but maybe I didn't
yeah no I I think that Dylan
is first and foremost an individual
secondly broken no laws that I'm aware
of
did he break it did she break any laws
not aware of any
did uh Budweiser break any laws no not
really did it insult their customers I
don't think so
I don't think so
no I I think Dylan should just live
Dylan's life and I will agree that
Dylan Mulvaney is very entertaining
which is what Dylan is trying to be
trying to be entertaining totally
succeeding making some kind of a
political Point well maybe I'm not sure
if the point is being made but everybody
gets their free speech
you know I
I guess I'm I'm as Pro Dylan Mulvaney As
I Am pro uh Colin Kaepernick
because sometimes you have to you have
to separate the quality of the protest
or the quality of the communication from
whether you agree with it you could
disagree with Colin Kaepernick uh and
you could disagree
with Dylan Mulvaney
but I don't disagree with the fact that
they're both effective they're both
putting their message out there
good for them you know that that that's
the America I like living in I like
living in the in the America where Colin
Kaepernick can do his thing
make his message even if you don't agree
with it and and the Dylan can do her
thing
and that you get to see all of it that
that is the country I want to live in so
that's that works for me
it would be better if cartoonists were
not canceled for
um for the wrong reasons
by the way have you ever met anybody in
person who thought I should be canceled
that's interesting because I haven't
you have you have in person in person
really
do you know that I haven't
oh most of you say yes interesting
but but I think maybe I asked the
question the wrong way
there are lots of people who are happy
that I'm canceled
that's a different question
and I think the people who are happy
that I'm canceled are being conflated
with the people who think it was the
right thing
because I've not talked to anybody who
thought I should be canceled not one
but maybe they're just afraid to say it
to me to my face
do you think that's the case
because everybody I've talked to on
social media no matter whether they're
left or right on social media I've not
personally talked to anybody who thought
I should be canceled
black or white
I haven't talked to anybody and I would
love to hear the argument to my face I'd
love somebody to make that argument
because I think they would look silly
wouldn't they
like they'd they would have to argue
that someone who is happily reading
Dilbert and was completely unaware that
a few thousand people saw me say one
thing one time
like what would be the logic of of
taking away that product that people
want to see it doesn't make any sense
yeah I've never seen anybody in favor of
uh persuasive English is hard to grasp
I'm good you I'm glad you recommend my
books
did I reach out to the New York Times
about what why would I reach out to the
New York Times
no I'm going to take the Richard Gere
approach
which I've respected so much I've told
you about this right
that Richard Gere didn't deny that a
gerbil was shoved up his butt
now I'm sure that didn't happen I'm very
very sure that never happened but the
fact that he's never denied it makes him
a legend in my mind
I love I love that sense of self
where he can be contained in his own
like movie of himself
and what the entire Globe thinks about
what he did with a gerbil is completely
irrelevant to his everyday life so he
just ignores it
yeah the the strangest thing about my
cancellation and I don't know if you
would be surprised by this the strangest
thing is that it didn't change my day
isn't that weird
like I don't think it changed anything
except that I have more freedom and I'm
enjoying myself more
but it didn't have any negative
consequence
well you know I quit the gym but I
wanted to quit that gym anyway
yeah if I went to the gym today
when there's some time has passed I
wouldn't have any problem
it was a very short few weeks where
people cared here's one of the best
lessons of life people don't care about
you I saw somebody tweet this the other
day one of the most important things you
can learn in life is that people really
really don't care about you
they care about themselves
so when the when the topic was fresh
I might have been approached
but that would have been about the
person not about me
as soon as the topic is no longer in
their minds like it doesn't have any
active feeling to them then they don't
care about me I'm completely irrelevant
to this it was something happening in
people's minds
that they might you know it might cause
some action on me but it's never about
me because nobody cares so all I have to
do is wait a month and I could I could
have gone back to my original gym if I
just waited a month there wouldn't be a
single person who cared after a month
yeah it's all yeah it's all about the
play exactly it's about the putting on
the performance
all right
um
it is questioned your fans for continued
okay
all right that's all we got for now
YouTube
I'll see you tomorrow thanks for joining
best
