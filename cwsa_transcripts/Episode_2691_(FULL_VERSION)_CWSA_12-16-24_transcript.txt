soon as I get my comments working
here
success good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams because it's the best thing
that ever happened to you but if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a tankered shell
wait no you need a cuper mug or a glass
of tankered shells or Stein a canteen
sugar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
including Monday's is called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
oh so
good well I have to start by saying that
last night in the man cave that I do
just for the subscribers to locals uh we
discovered that you can make pictures of
public figures using grock their new
image generator and you could have those
public figures appear to be uh very
interested in each other now it's not
going to do porn but if you'd like to
see a public figure making out with
another public figure apparently you can
do that because people were sending me a
lot of images of me making out with
Michelle Obama
and a few other
people so after that was done I said to
myself
huh I wonder I wonder how well this
works so I started putting in the IM is
myself and other beautiful famous woman
just to
[Laughter]
see now it doesn't do anything uh you
know that's beyond PG it's all PG rated
or maybe G but uh it is weirdly
fascinating to see how how just picture
perfect I can do of myself with another
person I've never met in person it is it
is scary
so let me tell
you yeah let me tell you the uh the
future is going to be wild meanwhile uh
the X app is the number one news app at
the moment imagine being the one that
the news wants to kill and he becomes
the new the number one news app I like
that but the problem is as others have
pointed
out isn't X only the number one news app
because it's where people go to make fun
of all the
news if all the mainstream news went
away
tomorrow there wouldn't be anything to
talk about on X X wouldn't have anything
it would just be independent people who
look at the mainstream news and decide
how true it is but if we didn't have any
there wouldn't be much to talk
about
so
um according to the New England Journal
of Medicine if you're using AI as your
doctor
it could have even worse cognitive
biases than human
doctors so they did a test and they
found that depending on how you prime
the AI what question you ask you might
get a response that's a little biased
even more biased than a human
doctor so well AI seems to be an amazing
thing for knowing what question to ask
your doctor it's really good for that by
the way I don't think the doctor love it
but if you want to just know if you're
asking the right questions and did you
leave anything out talk to AI before you
have your doctor appointment it really
makes a difference it's great doesn't
have all the exact answers
yet but it certainly is good way to
check that you've covered all your
bases um according to uh the new Atlas
publication chronic pain can be lowered
by better quality diet regardless of
body weight so if you improve your diet
so you're not eating junk food junk Feud
junk
food um
apparently um apparently it uh makes
your pain go go less now I have to admit
that's not one I would have known if you
had just asked
Scott um but it makes sense because a
good diet will give you less full body
inflammation
and you would think that pain would be
quite related to inflammation depends on
the pain but mostly so yeah apparently
eating well makes you feel
good
surprise um there's a study in yahu FAS
the older workers are the happiest
workers you know why that makes sense
the older workers are the happiest
workers cuz after a certain age you're
just the delighted that you have a job
at
all if you're over 65 and you have any
kind of a job you're probably delighted
you know uh turns out a lot of people at
that age don't even need the job it's
just the only way they can have a social
connection so they they love just having
their social connection and hey a little
little extra money doesn't hurt so that
doesn't surprise me but uh what's
interesting about worker happiness is
that workers are happiest when they're
youngest and when they're
oldest people are the least happy in the
prime of their
life so during those child raising
years not so good at all nope not so
good so before you have children pretty
happy after your children have moved out
of the house pretty happy but uh raising
children turns out it's hard to be happy
there's a different kind of Happiness
though that when kids are in your life
which most most of you have
experienced you you have this funny
experience where if you just took any
parent and you say hey excuse me are you
a parent well yes I've got a 10-year-old
and a
12-year-old uh and you say well how's
the quality of your day today they'd say
well not not great I got to drive this
kid all over and one of them sick so I
think I got their cold and and you know
wa too many things to do and I've got to
work late but I also have to go to my
kids game it's it's a
nightmare but if you ask them are you
happy they would say oh yeah I'm really
happy so during the middle of your life
if you have kids in your life you would
find that people will self-identify as
happy because they're really glad they
have kids and they have meaning and they
have something important in their lives
but it's really hard so the reason I'm
talking about this is that uh we have
this decline in birth
rate and the the biggest reason there's
a decline in birth rate in my opinion is
it's just too damn hard to be a par a
parent now I've been a just a stepparent
which usually is
easier but I can tell you if I did not
if if I hadn't entered that when I'd
already made money so that I could
afford things like you know somebody has
to watch somebody or you know basically
money makes everything easier
obviously but if I didn't have money and
I tried to have kids or step kids it
looks really hard it looks really hard
so uh we need to make it easier to be a
parent I guess that's my bottom line
there according to Global newswire Nano
nuclear energy and Digos technology
we're going to get together to make a
micro reactor
in Upstate New York they'll have 16 mows
of power now this is only interesting
because the trend for micro nuclear
reactors which I and all the smarter
people think are going to be the
future
um and at the same time just more to
that point the paler CTO is saying that
the uh our Fleet of ships seagoing ships
um should be be powered by
nukes and that it would lower inflation
now there's an idea imagine if the only
thing we did was uh authorize and
approve and build uh Shi shipping
contain what would you call it the big
ships that have containers on um if you
turn those into
micronuclear the way where the way our
nuclear submarines already work if we
already have the technology and it's
been working Forever on nuclear
submarines
would it be that much harder to put it
on a tanker I'd worry more about Pirates
then but I suppose that's not the
biggest problem in the
world according to unusual whales and
Fortune Magazine uh first reported 55%
of hiring managers notice employees
juggling side gigs during work
hours 55% of your employees are doing a
second job while on your clock
55% now that was always true you always
had people doing side gigs but
55% the uh the character Wall-E in the
dilber
comic uh was patterned on one of my
co-workers who used to sit in the
cubicle behind me and he would run a
second business from his
cubicle his first business was you know
whatever the job was was but he had he'
made a mistake with some uh
confidential um with some confidential
information and they said well we're not
going to fire you because you've been a
good employee except for this one
mistake but we can never promote
you so he had a job where he could never
be promoted and he was a young
man so instead of doing his job you know
and trying as hard as he could he just
he just started a second business and he
just ran his second business from his
cubicle he was doing lighting and was it
Lighting and Sound I think it was mostly
sound for big outdoor events so I'd hear
him answer the phone under the name of
his other
company that's the funny part answering
the phone as the other company
anyway um yeah that's a pretty big
problem I don't know how you would
manage an employee without assuming that
they have a second
job um Kyle bass who knows a lot about
investing and he follows China he says
China's economy is experiencing uh its
largest financial collapse since
2002 so bond yields are down and banks
are he call he says insolvent and
leveraged at 350% of reported
GDP now I saw in the comments somebody
saying that that might be a little bit
alarmist and that China is a centralized
economy and they have lots of tools that
they can make sure their Banks don't
fail and stuff like that so they're
probably not you know it's not like
they're minutes from falling off the
edge of the Earth or anything but uh one
more indication that China is not
thriving
um there was a alarming
report at the New York young Republicans
Club I guess uh a young adviser to
president Trump a 27-year-old named Alex
brtz
i' had never heard of but he has
apparently a good reputation people said
good things about him but he was
speaking uh on
stage and he just started slurring his
words as if maybe a stroke and then he
just collapsed and like you know dragged
down the whole Lecter and so he I guess
he came around
backstage and he was you know alert and
seemed okay but then reportedly he
passed out again in the hospital run way
to the hospital so we don't know what's
wrong with young Alex brtz but uh a lot
of Republicans seem to like him and we
wish him the best so keep an eye on
that um yeah some are saying it was
dehydration I don't know Does
dehydration cause you to slur your words
maybe I don't
know uh well CNN's getting some heat you
know I saw this story and I kind of
passed by it the first time so I
remember seeing the video of CNN
apparently being there when one of the
notorious uh Syrian prisons was being
liberated after the rebels took over
from the government and it showed one
particular Syrian prisoner who was being
freed and I remember people saying that
he didn't look like he was a real
prisoner because he didn't look like he
was you know damaged Enough by the time
in prison and now we find out that the
alleged prisoner was actually well one
of the one of the prison's notorious
torturers so he worked for the
government he wasn't a prisoner he was
apparently pretending to be a prisoner
for the benefit of CNN's
cameras and so he just acted like he was
being discovered in the
prison did that really happen
um it it makes me wonder if the if the
story that is fake news is entirely
fake do we know he wasn't just recently
put in that prison I don't
know I don't
know
um so we'll keep an eye on
that uh did you know according to report
in Wall Street Journal that people will
change their spending habits
based on whether their party is in power
and won the election so when Democrats
win national election they spend more
because they feel more
optimistic and same with Republicans so
at the moment Republicans are looking at
more big ticket stuff like cars and
houses uh because they have optimism
about
Trump and I have uh two comments about
the Democrats number one uh it's going
to be tough to be a Democrat for a few
more years because they hated it the
first time Trump was President they're
probably not going to like it that much
better this time uh but I wonder does
this make democrats undatable for four
years I wasn't planning to date one
but if you're so unhappy that you're
changing your spending
habits and they do seem to have genuine
you know mental distress over
this imagine if you're in the dating
pool
it seems like dating anybody who was a
Democrat would be a bad deal right now
because they're all going to be unhappy
and bitching about stuff if you if you
were dated
Republican hey how's it going Republican
great looks like the golden golden ages
kicked off got any problems H none
really that's worth mentioning
everything seems to be going great have
you caught the vibe the vibe is all
positive a lot of unity going on hey
Democrat
how are you doing well it's the end of
democracy we it hasn't happened yet but
any moment now the big old Orange
monster will be stealing our democracy
and our bodily autonomy and uh we're all
doomed we're all
doomed so I'm going to say uh maybe
maybe a little less dating of democrats
for four
years um
so Trump for the first time ever his
favorability ratings are higher than his
unfavorability ratings according to RCP
average daily wire is talking about
this the first time so did you know that
never before has he had more people
favorable than
unfavorable and you might ask yourself
why is
that what what is he doing
right and the answer is everything
you as I said before he ran the greatest
campaign uh even the people on the
losing end are saying consistently okay
the Republicans were really smart Trump
ran a great campaign okay what he did
was smart you know and it's just one
after another uh the people in the
losing end are saying yep they just did
better he was smarter van Jones is
saying it I've seen that Jessica tarof
saying that it was brilliant to ship the
migrants to the blue cities so even the
Democrats are
noticing that the the side that looks
for merit instead of
identity did way
better let me say it
again the team that says Merit should be
the thing you look at outperform the
team that says identity should be the
thing you look at
what what did they think was going to
happen as I've said before Dei destroys
everything it touches and it destroys
the fastest and hardest whatever Dei
touches soonest and most aggressively
and that would be the Democrats the
entire Democrat Party was soon you know
they they were fast on the Dei and most
aggressive because people are watching
and it it's completely destroyed just as
the theory would
suggest
but I saw a podcast it looked like a
Democrat poster who was doing some uh
some focus groups and what the focus
groups were saying and that it was a
focused group of people who were who had
been non-trump supporters usually
Democrats and had voted for him for the
first time so they didn't vote him for
the first they didn't vote for him in
the the first two elections but this
time they did and so the question is why
now why why would you change your mind
now and do you know
why the reason is not
surprising but it was kind of
encouraging here's the reason that
Democrats at least and it's a focus
group so it's not a it's not a
scientific poll but several people said
the same thing which is Meaningful to
me that they were a little unsure about
Trump still but they liked that he
picked RFK
Jr so RFK
Jr did move votes because his
credibility and people liked his topic
especially the food and the you making
sure our drugs are safer so RFK Jr's
message was so strong and he was so
credible that when he said you know what
I can work with Trump as long as I could
get my stuff done and then Trump helps
him get stuff
done um people love
that and I love it too because one of my
biggest issues was our food supply and I
didn't see anything that was going to be
done by just Republicans so you throw
RFK Junior in there and I'm like whoa
you suddenly went from most of the
things I like but not even my top
issue didn't even get my top issue my
number one
issue but now they got it now they got
my top issue
food and they got all the other issues
too so you throw that in there you throw
in Elon Musk and you know uh basically
the argument is that Trump assembled the
Democrats of the 1990s because even
Trump was a democrat in the 90s
so um yeah between you know David sex
and Telsa gabard and Bill Amman he's not
in the team but he's you know switch
sides uh Joe Rogan switch sides not on
the
team but yeah it looks like this pirate
ship idea of bringing people from more
than one group together is having a
modeling effect on the public so when
the public sees that these public
figures can work together you know being
being as diametrically opposed as you
could possibly be in general but when
they had something they both agree on
they could work together that is really
un
Ying that's as unifying as you could
possibly get I don't want everybody to
agree with me I want people who do agree
on the things that we do agree on to
work on that you know and if that's the
only thing Trump gets Unity on is that
yeah for the things we agree on well we
can work with that like the border for
example that'd be amazing it'd be better
than anything we've ever seen in this
country
really so the pish ship is
working uh meanwhile Trump continues to
do what I call the new CEO move to make
a good first impression and hit the
ground running as they say and to make
it look like he's just succeeded before
he even Starts Now succeeding before
You' started is just so strong
persuasion it's just completely baller
and so and so now the uh soft Bank CEO
must son he's going to visit the US the
US today and he's going to make an
announcement with
Trump so I love my de facto president I
love the fact that the world is treating
Trump like the one they need to talk to
they understand he's de facto president
not regular president but still
everybody's just using common sense and
what is the Biden Administration
complaining about so far they're not
I don't know why you you do kind of
expect them to complain a little bit
that um Trump's acting like a president
but I feel like they get it too you know
somebody needs to act like a president
and they don't have anybody who can do
it
so so apparently uh soft Bank CEO is
going to put A1 billion investment in
the US focused on building out
AI thinks he can create a 100,000 jobs
somebody was saying that's no big deal
100 billion and 100,000 jobs somebody
smarter said no that's just the first
order 100,000 jobs creates 100,000
people to buy stuff so 100,000 new
consumers you know uh all the all the
supply chain that would Supply these
businesses it's uh big 100
billion might be a multiplier
to something like half a trillion it's
all
done let's talk about those drones you
know you love them you love the
drones So Adam
kininger who you know as being famous
for not really being good at anything in
politics he he may have been good in the
military I wouldn't know but he's really
bad at
politics uh so he used to be a
republican change sides became the worst
worst politician in the world so he's a
pilot and he says he's spent time
looking at all the videos of the drones
and he says they're all
airplanes they're all
airplanes
so what was he looking at do you think
he looked at all the
videos or do you think there somebody
got to him and
said Adam tell them it's all
airplanes because they're obviously not
all
airplanes they're they're really
obviously not all
airplanes according
to hundreds if not thousands if not
millions of observers so he thinks it
could be a mass
hysteria and he points out that there's
nothing illegal about flying over a
military base and that anybody can do it
now that's the first time I've heard
that do you believe that that's true do
you believe that it's legal to fly over
a military installation obviously it's
going to depend which one I don't think
you can fly over all of them but are
there some of them say in a metropolitan
area where it's no big deal it's just
one other thing that's on the
ground so I'm going to put a question
mark next to that one I don't know that
you can always fly over them but maybe
if you're let's say if you're a
commercial airline you've got a flight
plan and you're a trusted entity maybe I
don't know so I got a question on that
one all right um so he thinks that if
anything if drones are involved at all
it's probably just some
tests but it's way more
activity than just some tests so I'm
going to rule that one out I did a
little uh research because I was trying
to figure out uh what is the lowest
height
that these aircraft should be at if
they're regular aircraft so a regular
aircraft if it's over a uh populated
area is not supposed to be below 1,000
ft uh of the highest thing that's nearby
so whatever is the highest building
that's in the immediate neighborhood
they have to be at least 1,000 ft above
the highest nearby
building if they're in a sparse ly
populated place they could go down as
low as 500
ft and if they were over let's say an
ocean and you know it's a private
private plane or something over an ocean
they could go even lower than 500 ft
because there's nobody there
anyway
um will I debate you on the thing I
already agree with no but thanks for
asking um
so that's so keep that in mind I
mentioned that because yesterday was it
yesterday I drove home from walking the
dog yes I drive to where I walk the dog
because there's a good place to walk the
dog but it's hard to walk walk to it
anyway I look up and there was a uh a
really large jet looked like a private
jet um but one of the biggest ones you
know like a billionaire a private jet
and it was going directly over my house
and I'd never seen a jet that
low um to me it looked like it was lower
than 1,000
ft has anybody had the experience of
let's say a daytime jet that you thought
was lower than you've seen in the past
or am my imagining it do do you think
it's just my imagination because I'm
sort of tuned to it and so my particular
activators are just picking it up and I
wouldn't have even noticed before but it
was a big Jet and it was low enough so I
could see all the details of the
components of the
jet now that's too low right for a
jet when was the last time you had a jet
go over you unless you were right next
to an airport when was the last time you
had one go over where you could see all
the parts like in in
detail I I think it was closer than a
th000 F feet but I don't know what a
th000 ft looks like
really so I don't know what's going on
there but
um Robert Malone you remember Robert
Malone from the pandemic he was one of
the inventors of the MRNA mRNA
platform and he he became anti- I won't
say antia but you a cautious person
about that whole thing but uh his
hypothesis
is that it's a a federal
scop and that the point of the scop is
to get um is to get a law passed and
apparently there's a law being
considered that would um put lots of
regulations on personal
drones
huh what do you think do you think it's
a scop so everybody in the country says
no we can't have drones running around
uncontrolled just at the same time that
the government is considering I think
it's extending something that's already
there but the government is considering
the question of how much to regulate
drones that are owned by
individuals so as they're considering
how much to regulate drones we have a
drone crisis all over the
country that's scaring the public
could it be that the entire thing is a
psychological operation to make sure
that the military has clamped down on
any drones that they don't own so it's
easier to protect the country because
you wouldn't want to say to the country
hey we're going to take your drones away
because they can be turned into
weapons and then all the people who like
guns are going to say um you're not
going to take your gun you're not going
to take my guns and you're not going to
take my drones that I can weaponize why
in case I need to weaponize it that's
why in case I need to weaponize it I
want to be able to because you know the
government so what do you
think do you
think that it's a major s
up I see my YouTube is down but looks
like he came back
up do you think it's a major scop
and the that the military or the
government is trying to make us afraid
of drones so we'll favor our government
Banning drones or at least Banning
anything that would look dangerous as a
drone I'm going to say
maybe but it doesn't really match you
know my experience of
life
um yeah it doesn't match it it's not
impossible it's not
impossible but it doesn't really match
what I think here's what I think I think
if it were a scop it wouldn't be so
extensive and it also wouldn't be in
every country because we're getting
reports from you know all over the world
about too many
drones
so I don't know I would say I'll put
that you know third or fourth on the
list of
possibilities but I'll tell you my
current drone theory if you haven't
heard it I have up updated it I have
abandoned the idea that they're looking
for um
radiation or chemical weapons now the
radiation part I abandoned because I
just happen to know somebody who worked
in that
field and the person who worked in the
field Tom
sour um says you know trust me I have
experienced in the field because he
apparently he searched for wmds when he
was in the service
and there are ways to look for radiation
but without giving too much away about
the way we do things I'll just say it
wouldn't be this
way so in other words you would if you
had complete access to the ground you
know it's America so they have access to
the ground the last thing you would do
is try to fly over it to get the
radiation signal you would you might fly
over it but you'd mostly have stuff in
the ground cuz you want to you know
really get close to the source so it's
very unlikely that these drones have
some kind of souped up radiation
detectors at the height they are so if
you're going to be a th000 feet in the
air your detecting isn't going to be
that great so so probably not it's
probably not about detecting
anything um so here's my current theory
I'll start with my assumptions see which
ones you agree agree with by the way the
thing I'm going to read to you I posted
and last I checked it had
800,000 uh
reposts and um margerie Taylor green
said it sounded like a good
hypothesis and I've never seen more
positive comments so almost everybody
who reposted it said oh this is very
feasible this might be the answer and it
might be so this is based on my personal
Talent stack which I improved by 5% by
listening to somebody who knows about
how you search for
radiation so I had zero knowledge about
how to search for radiation yesterday
and now I have a little bit just a
little bit enough enough to deal with
this
question but I'm also the Dilbert guy so
I I'm really tuned into just how any big
organization gets anything done so I'm
going to use my
filter as the guy who knows how any big
organization does any big thing and it's
going to explain everything okay so
here's my assumptions number one uh the
future of warfare is drones everybody
agrees right the future of warfare is
drones
also it's going to happen really fast
well it is happening it's happening
right now and whoever can most quickly
increase their drone assets is in the
best shape the United States always is
running fast to be the F you know best
military power in the world so if you
know that drone Warfare is the future
and you know it's right now like when I
say the future it's like now now now now
really really urgent you know you've got
several
hotspots you've got the Ukraine War you
might want to have some leverage there
you the Middle East is a mess Iran is
big question mark you really really want
to have lots of drones and you want to
be the unambiguous leader in the good
ones now we also know that we have a
drone pilot
shortage so what happens if you know you
need lots and lots and lots of drones
but you don't have enough
Pilots obviously you would do massive
training of pilots and you would do it
as soon as possible now I'd like to make
a comment for the NPCs we're going to be
piling into make a comment go NPCs this
is where you shine say the most obvious
thing that you say in this
situation I know it's going to appear
who's the first
NPC you're going to say it wait for
it the training Pilots to run the drones
go come on I'm disappointed there's got
to be at least one NPC watching this all
right I'll do it for
you the NPC says oh bcot don't you know
that the drones are autonomous and they
don't need any pilots and they're run by
the AI and
stuff that's what you're supposed to
say it's the most obvious thing to say
to act like you're a little bit smarter
than me you're so dumb you don't know
they don't need Pilots nobody needs
Pilots for their
drones okay here's what's true there's
not one kind of
drone there are lots and lots of
different kinds of
drones some are only piloted by humans
such as if you an infantry person you
had a little handheld drone and you just
wanted to see the enemy on the other
side of the Hill that would not be an AI
drone that would just be one you operate
and it would be completely piloted by
human but that's not what we're talking
about
secondly there would be of course some
Dr drones that are basically fire and
forget meaning that you might you might
put in the coordinates but then when
once it goes it's just going to do its
thing and maybe be a suicide
drone but that still requires a pilot in
The Limited sense that somebody had to
pick the target program the Drone know
which drone they were dealing with you
know make sure it was safe to launch uh
and then then probably at some point
make some human decisions when the Drone
reaches its Target of whether that's
still really a good Target or you know
maybe they need to you know jog over and
do some other thing before they get
there who knows so my presumption is
we're not anywhere near getting rid of
Pilots for drones how many of you will
agree with me so
far
um what does musk say
drone big drone Wars are
coming yeah so Elon Musk was saying that
we haven't seen how big the Drone Wars
are going to be it's going to be epic so
we know we need Pilots we know we don't
need don't have enough we know we're
going to need massive drone buildup and
we know there's no such thing as having
enough drones no such thing as having
enough drones there's no such thing as
having enough drones cuz whoever has the
most wins every drone battle you know if
they have good ones so so we should be
absolutely in a panic mode in the
military manufacturing drones as fast as
we could manufacture drones do you so
far do you do you follow the
assumptions assumption drone Wars are
for sure we need them right away we must
be manufacturing them like crazy and we
need a lot of Pilots even if the pilot
is just putting in the coordinates
somebody needs to do
it so put all that
together where would you train if you
had new drones with new technology and
you had to quickly train lots and lots
of people well NPCs
go this is another NPC place so if
you're an NPC and I say they might these
might be training missions you
say Scott let me tell you with my vast
NPC knowledge that if you're going to
have a training facility it's not going
to be over the densest populated place
in the country it's not going to be
there it would be in a remote
location and then you could test all day
in your remote
location here's why that's not
smart that would be if you need to do a
little bit of training
for a few
drones yes I agree with you if you were
going to do a little bit of training for
a few drones and you weren't in any
hurry you would find a nice remote
location and you would do all your
training for your handful of
pilots in that one place however if you
decided that drones are the future of
warfare there's no such thing as too
many drones you're making them as fast
as you can and you don't don't have
enough Pilots for them what do you do
then do you wait until you've got a nice
remote place and move all of the assets
that you need for testing which would
include a battleship or not a battleship
but some some uh some aquatic military
asset that they can launch it from
because most of them are launched from
ships so you need someplace that's close
enough to the coast so that rules out a
lot of your remote locations
you need ideally all right here's where
my Dilbert experience comes in you've
got brand new drones a new let's say new
class of drones and they're being and
people are being trained on them who has
to be there for the whole thing the
manufacturer the manufacturer of the
drones has to be wherever they're being
tested in a big way it's not like just
send a guy it's not like well we sent
one of our Engineers to your remote
location you know just ask Bob if you
have a problem no they would put massive
staff anywhere it's there's being
testing and training they would be doing
the training actually and they would do
it not just in a remote location but
NPCs here's where you get your minor win
yes they would test some drones in
remote
locations but what else would they do if
they have massive need for training and
massive need for drones what else would
they do
they would train right here because it's
the fastest and everything's
here if you train on the drones in New
Jersey what do you have you've got the
fleet so you can fly from ships at Ocean
because the ships are here and and it's
their home base I guess you you have
military bases that you can fly back and
forth to which is very much what you'd
be doing with a drone um sometimes
transporting but other times just
finding a Target
and you would be going over lots of
residential
areas and it would be easier it would be
probably far more beneficial to train
where there's a lot going on in the
ground so that you can recognize things
at night and you would also probably
train at night because most of the
missions would be at night because if
they turn their lights off they're hard
to see and there and therefore hard to
shoot down now if you're only 1,000 ft
up so give me give me a fact check on
this if you're a th000 feet in the air
and you're a
drone can you be hit by Small Arms
fire can somebody just put their machine
gun in the air and just started shooting
in your general direction if you're a
drone and you're only 1,000 fet in
air so it seems to me that they have the
option of turning on lights if they're
operating in America and they have the
option of turning off the lights if
they're in a danger zone
so um they would train at night because
that would be the best time to do
missions and they would train in the
United States even in populated areas
because that's where all their assets
are for training that's where the
manufacturer is it's where the Bas is
it's where the Navy is just off the
coast so what you should see is on both
coasts of the United
States uh lots and lots of
drones in the air cuz the Coast are
where you have all the assets and you
can kind of test stuff fast if you're
doing it
massively and again if you only had a
few pilots and a few drones and you
weren't in any big hurry you would go to
some remote Desert location and train as
long as you want it we're not in that
situation we're in the we need as many
as we can get right away training is
critical as fast as you can you would do
that in the coast because that's where
all the assets
are more importantly if one of these
drones goes down you don't want it to be
on a foreign country because they're
going to get a hold of it first and
they're going to reverse engineer it
because you can't trust the other
country even an Allied country you
couldn't trust them totally so
everything makes sense for
training um and then you're going to say
but why would you do it over in an urban
area to which I say have you noticed
that when people say they're
hovering it's never over their house
house in an urban area but if they're
passing by is often over an urban area
so my guess would be that the drones are
as um let's say as um good a quality as
all the other aircraft that can fly over
your city so if a regular aircraft can
follow fly over your city and a drone
has the same let's say reliability and
it's not in war and it's not doing any
it's not doing any Maneuvers it's just
flying over that that would be allowed
as far as I know that's completely legal
to fly over a city with a drone that's
obeying all the L the rules it's high
enough and low enough it's got the
lights on and maybe it registered slight
path or whatever has to
do so when you hear their when you hear
they're doing things like hovering which
might be misidentified by the way
sometimes it might look like it's
hovering it's only because it's coming
in your direction from a
from a great distance it would look like
it's stationary so some of it might be
misinterpretation but my guess is if
what they're doing is training they
might be doing the dangerous stuff over
the ocean just like you would want them
to do you know see if you could do
figure eight and whatever but if you
need if you need to just go back to
base let's say to get charged up or
deliver something you're just going a
straight line at the height you should
and maybe that's what people see in the
city
so no real danger as far as I can tell
because they're not sending up
experimental drones over the city they
would be sending up things that are
really really really well flight tested
and not in any specific danger there's
nobody shooting at
them all right
um so so we're ruling out sniffing for
radiation because it's just not the way
you would do it it wouldn't be optimal
for that and the other thing is we've
heard that the flights seem to stop
around 11:00 p.m. every night but
they've been going for
months what possible thing would you do
that you would do massively as soon as
it's dark but you'd be done by 11:
p.m. that really suggests
training because if they were sniffing
for if they were looking for terrorists
or looking for something they would do
it after
12 if it were some if it were such a
national emergency that they would put
this much energy into it they would work
after midnight because it would be
something existential to at least New
Jersey if they're taking off at 11:
saying all right looks like it's a
quitting time I'll see everybody uh not
in the morning not in the morning but
rather when it gets dark
again that sounds like business as usual
to me
so and and even if you look at the
theory that it's it's a scop even a scop
you could save a lot of money compared
to what they're doing if what you wanted
to do was a c up where you've got lots
of you know lots of drones in the air
did you need
50 did you need
50 no not really you could do a S up
with three
drones and you just have those three
drones Buzz one city that's near near
enough to DC that somebody hears about
it
um I see your question ex boss man but
I'm not going to repeat it it is
funny all right I'm going to repeat it
because it's
funny and the comments somebody used the
uh the impolite word for people who are
shorter than
average um but said that the that there
seems to be a shortage of little people
are we sure are we sure that the little
people that we saw more often in public
have not just become drone drone
Pilots which is actually it's like
funny but the more you think about it
the more you think why not I mean if
jockeys if you pick jockeys because of
their weight and their height wouldn't
you also pick drone Pilots if you had a
tiny little drone wouldn't you also pick
them by their height and
weight and and if the little person was
you know fully functional in every way
except
height and you've got a 10t long uh
drone
maybe I I don't think that's the thing
but all right so if it's true the really
stopping at about 11:00 every night I
would think that that's pretty good
evidence that it's a training training
Mission the so the only thing that seems
unusual is the quantity of it and I
disagree with um
kinzinger um I I had the same experience
as kininger and I want you to hear this
clearly all right because later if you
if if I get something wrong and later
you attack me I want to I want to make
sure you hear this
part I have personally seen no
video that looked like anything but an
airplane
some video I've seen that clearly were
not airplanes but were far more likely
an artifact of how it was filmed or
sometimes they came from years
ago sometimes you can't tell what the
source is but everything they had a
source I can
identify they look like normal aircraft
to me
now what people say is no Scott what
you're noticing what you're not seeing
is how many of them are there are acting
strange and how low they are and they
and they're loud Etc but I'm not there
in
person so my my belief that these are
not regular
airplanes is based on credible people
you know people in in one case somebody
I know personally um who say no I stood
there trust me they're definitely not
airplanes so I don't believe any of the
videos because I personally have ever
seen any credible video of anything that
looked anything but a commercial
airplane with a person running it now
there might have been some hobby drones
that look like hobby drones but that's
not what the problem is so as clearly as
I can let me say I haven't seen anything
that looks like a
drone I've only seen things that look
like airplanes to
me but I do
trust I do trust the reports
because you saw the reporter for news I
think it was news Nation reporter said
oh I was poo pooing it myself until I
saw it myself like oh I'm completely
convinced there's something going on
here so those are the people that I'm
choosing to believe at the
moment could all of those trustworthy
people be in some kind of uh you know um
Mass hysteria
yes yes I could
I think it's unlikely though uh I'm
usually the one who's the first one to
say Mass hysteria if you've been
following me for a while you know that I
I jump to mass hysteria right away for
stuff like this but I'm not there on
this one I I wouldn't say I wouldn't
never be there it wouldn't take a
lot to push me into Mass hysteria but
I'm not there yet I I think it's just
training but it does suggest that there
would be a big battle that we're
expecting and I expect that that might
have something to do with
Iran so we'll see uh meanwhile Mitt
Romney had some good things to say about
Trump's
success um Mitt Romney was on some he
was talking to Grace today on CNN and he
said uh that the Republican party is
basically the the magga
party he said that Trump succeeded in
making the Republic is the party of the
middle class and that's the kill shot
right there if you're a Republican and
you can acknowledge which I would agree
is true that Trump has successfully
moved um what is middle class over to
the at least enough of it over to the
Republican side you can't take that away
from him and you can't be Republican and
say that sucked you just have to say we
always wanted to do this nobody did it
except Trump trump gets the win and I
like that mney who has plenty of reasons
to be anti-trump because they haven't
gotten along he has plenty of reasons he
decided that under the current situation
that he's going to be pro-
success so he didn't say he's Pro Trump
he said that Trump has succeeded in ways
that are important and that probably JD
Vance will be the 2028 nominee because
he's well well spoken and he's worked
with him apparently um Romy had had some
really bad words about JD Vince in the
past and I loved what I loved what uh
Romney said about
that so when it was brought up that he
had said some really pretty bad stuff
about JD Vance he said that was long ago
he said it was long ago and since then
I've worked with
him good that's a good answer I I like
the it was long
ago because that shows me somebody who
can get over
something if you tell me that yeah I I
was not happy with this but that was
long ago I just think oh you have a you
have a workable brain that when new
information comes in you can change your
mind I like that yeah long ago I used to
think this now I think that no more
questions I have no further questions if
it was long ago you changed your mind
okay um
and so he says Trump deserves legitimate
credit for expanding the
party uh he says that the part
Republicans are magging now no question
and then he went further he said that
the Democrats he said he said the
Democrats in trouble I don't know how
they
recover now that mirrors what I said so
I've been saying it's not just that the
Democrats are down but normally when a
party is down it's obvious how they
would recover oh well just you know
tweak your policies get a better
candidate you'll be fine next time it
doesn't look like it this time does it
it looks like they've destroyed the very
structure of everything and so Mindy
says yeah uh they lost their base union
members leaving and now people see
Democrats as College professors and
quote woke
scolds I love those two words together
woke SC old
s it's okay to be
woke and sometimes it's okay to be a
scold but if you're scolding me about
wokeness we're not we're not going to be
friends I could take a scolding and get
over it and you know some wokeness I can
even accept but nope don't be a woke
scold that's as bad as you can get
meanwhile Governor Whitmer Democrat
um says she's uh willing to work with
President Trump she said quote I know
Donald Trump cares about Michigan Fox
News is reporting
now people are talking about this in
ways I've never heard people talk about
it meaning working with the other side
who says it this way who says I know
Trump cares about
Michigan is isn't that a sort of extreme
for politics I mean extremely friendly
normally you would say something like
well uh I don't like anything Trump's
doing but you know it's my job to work
with him so we'll we'll do as well as we
can isn't that usually all you say
normally you just say I'll do the best I
can you know it's my job but she went so
far as to say that Trump cares about
Michigan that is not a gift you'd want
to give to your
enemy now it could be that because he
can't run for office again but she's
clearly setting him up for
Success since when do the Democrat
Governors set up Trump for
Success at least in the
wording anyway so to me that was
remarkable and then uh you probably know
the story but there's a Democrat Mega
donor um named Lindy Lindy Lee who's
kind of turned on the Democrats for
wasting a billion dollars and not
getting elected
and she's getting a lot of uh attention
lately Gateway punded is reporting on
this and but she says the Democrats now
have quote a stench of loser hanging
over the party and that people are
pissed at Obama now that's funny the
stench of losing is so heavy that people
are mad at like a guy two presidents
ago they're so mad that they're mad at a
guy two presidents ago
and they're
pissed and they want their billion
dollars back I think
um so that's that's worth noting but uh
I heard some some uh idea that maybe
Lindy Lee would run for governor of
California and if she did she might be
running at least in the primary against
KL
Harris now others have said that now KL
Harris is not own direct interest in
running for governor but everybody
thinks it's sort of a the most natural
best thing she could do um I heard
somebody say that if she entered the
race it would clear the field meaning
people would just say oh she's going to
win there's no point in running that
might be right she she might clear the
field and the the Democrats might say
you know we just need to prop her up and
that's all you would need in California
you would just need the Democrats to say
yes
anyway so if you got Mitt Romney say
I'll give him a chance you've got
Whitmer saying I'll give him a chance
you got a DNC Mega donor saying wow the
Democrats ruined everything she's not
quite saying I'll give Trump a chance
but she gets it she understands why he
won meanwhile Daniel Baldwin U brother
of the other Baldwins was on the pbd
podcast and he claims that I guess
common knowledge in Hollywood that the
celebrity inner circles are
saying that LeBron James does have a
diddy tape and that it was already
purchased on the black market so that
somebody already owns LeBron James
because they own the blackmail tape that
LeBron James would really like to own
how much do you think LeBron James would
pay for a diddy party tape that showed
him doing we we imagine something he
wouldn't want them to see how much do
you think he'd
pay well it would depend of course on
what was on the video because it could
range it could range from oh we don't
like that you do that to um why are you
in jail so we don't know what it is so I
won't I guess I shouldn't speculate
um but this would be this would be a
massive story
can you imagine can you imagine if these
were really for
sale imagine if you are Elon
Musk you're sitting there and you read
the news you see that the LeBron tape is
for sale and you say to yourself if I
just make a post on X saying I'm willing
to buy
it I wonder what would
happen because he wouldn't care about
the cost right he could just pay
whatever he want but he could own the he
could own
LeBron if you see
LeBron start to back uh
Maga it means that musk is the one who
bought his his blackmail
tape now that would be
funny now here's the way to do it if you
end up buying LeBron's black m tape and
let's say what you want him to do is you
know back Republicans let's say
um you don't want to be illegal and say
uh Lebron I will blackmail you if you
don't do what I want that that's illegal
you go to jail for that so you go the
opposite way say LeBron good news I
bought I bought the tape so it's off the
market and LeBron might say oh good so
you'll destroy it right and then you say
well I didn't want to destroy it but
I've taken it off the market you don't
have to worry about it but
you could just change your mind and
Shout to somebody anytime you wanted
right I could but but I wouldn't do that
because I like you LeBron you and I are
good friends by the way uh I'd like to
chat some more but I'm going off to uh
Trump rally uh my good friends uh were
all in mega uh they say
hi and you'd be very close to LeBron
becoming a
republican just to make sure the the
video didn't get out now to be clear I
don't want to malign LeBron I personally
have no knowledge that he did anything
wrong or that even any tape
exists so I'm not confirming that
there's anything he did wrong or any
tape exists and I'm hoping that there is
none I hope that he perfect law-abiding
citizen and it will always be that way
but I'm just telling you how to
Blackmail somebody you don't say the
words you just own the tape and say you
know I own your tape I sure like Trump
so don't take my advice for it if you
become a black mailer it's probably
illegal no matter how you do
it um Mike Davis who's a republican
attorney type we see in social media a
lot he says Manhattan da Alvin brag and
his team illegally conspired to violate
the constitutional rights of Americans
he said so did Jack Smith fonny Willis
Tish James Chris Mays Matthew Graves
their offices he says they must face a
Federal Criminal probe under some law
and then they
said I like that Republicans are
ironically or jokingly sarcastically
saying no one's Above the Law you know
because I say it a lot too because I
think it's funny
now but um as much as I don't like
lawfare and I would not want to be
associated with anybody who pursued it I
think the names that he named
have done enough in
public that looks sketchy enough to
me that if these particular ones get I
don't want to say lawf fared but
investigated that would be appropriate
and my my sense of you know what is
right and ethical and moral and gives
enough freedom to the country but not
too much yeah they should be
investigated it does feel like there
were crimes there and big ones like
we're not talking about jaywalking if it
were jaywalking I'd say h who cares um
we're talking about something that was
going to change the very nature of the
country forever and maybe destroy it it
wasn't they they were an existential
threat to the entire country in my
opinion because a few more years of
Democrats I think would have been been
the end of
us just in terms of national debt if
nothing
else here's the funniest story of the
day um
back when Biden took over when he first
got elected he fired some 4,000 uh Trump
appointees one of them was
uh
Spicer
um so what's his first name why am I
forgetting Spicer's first name um who
worked for Trump and he was one of those
people has
uh tell me Spicer first
name
uh Sean Spicer
yeah thank you so Sean Spicer
um so he was one of the people who got
fired by Biden so he took it to court to
try to get it
reversed or did
he so he took it to court that he got
fired by Biden and he argued that
because the the appointment had some
kind of a term to it that he couldn't be
fired until the term was
over but the the court the judge
specifically he ruled that that the
president could fire him so Shan Spicer
challenged
Biden uh but Biden won so it turns out
that Biden could fire him even though
Trump had put him in a position to had a
term now this is important because there
might be people people that Trump wants
to fire that also were appointed by
Biden and also have
terms here's the funny
part the reason that Sean Spicer
challenged it was not because he wanted
his job back in the Biden
Administration he challenged it so he
could lose the
case because in so losing he would know
that the next Republican who came in
could fire all the Democrats in those
jobs and so they
will so the
claim uh and I'll put it in a quote from
uh Sean uh what no one ever understood
was that this was not about actually
getting back uh on the board meaning the
job he had because my term had been uh
had been expired for months oh uh it was
forcing them to argue in the affirmative
that they had the ultimate authority to
fire anybody at any time which they
did and the court accepted it so
basically Trump has that power
now 40 CH 40
chess right there that's some 40 chests
by the way there is probably still time
to get your dilber calendar if you go to
dilbert.com and follow the link to the
sales page it's the only place you can
get it can't get it from Amazon can't
get it from a store only from that one
online source so we have uh What uh uh
nine days till Christmas the odds of
getting it in nine days are not 100% not
100% but you'd almost certainly get it
before January 1 so if there's somebody
you know who just can't live without a
dilber calendar uh and you don't
absolutely have to have it wrapped under
the tree you got plenty of
time all
right um and uh I've also got a number
of books the one that will change
people's lives that they haven't seen is
reframe your brain this one is on Amazon
with my other books like when bigly is
reupdated that's one that tells you how
Trump uses his persuasion and then had
it failed almost everything and still wi
big the second edition the one with the
blue cover um people love it I guarantee
that and also God's debris the complete
works if you look at all my books you'll
find something for everybody so
something for everybody this Christmas
and I guarantee if they're readers
they'll like them um Democrats are not
and I guarantee if they're ever like to
Dilbert they'll like the calendar um you
can't lose and I would like to give you
two
Christmas
recommendations that I have no I have no
connection to okay so I have no
Financial connection to them these are
just things that I like a lot number one
you you may have noticed I often wear
this back warmer in the morning I love
this back warmer I if you've never
experienced wearing a back
warmer it's really feels really good so
I I started wearing it because I had
some you know just a back strain a few
weeks ago it's all good now my back is
great but I keep wearing it because I
like it I just love how it feels and it
makes my back feel
better the other thing for the same
purpose was was I got a uh uh one of
these incline tables where it holds you
upside down by your ankles now you
probably say to yourself I don't think I
want to try that that sounds dangerous
and what if I can't get back up well the
one I got as an option to go back
60% so you're never really you don't
feel like you're out of control and it
doesn't stretch your body too much but
it feels great it feels great so I think
it's helping with my back cuz my my back
has never felt better literally it's
never felt better my in my entire adult
life and it's called a teeter so that
that's the model now I only I only know
I bought one and I'm really happy with
it but it's spelled
te t er they have several models you can
see them on Amazon so I recommend them
if anybody has a any kind of a back
problem for which that would be
indicated but I'm no doctor so don't use
it unless you're sure that it would
would be safe for
you then my last advice is this is a
weird one if you do any any kind of uh
video like Zoom or you do podcasting
there's something you need really badly
and you see one you see behind me in my
back shoulder there's a it's a printer
stand so if you went to Amazon you said
search for printer stands it would be
something that sits above your keyboard
I guess or something you put something
under it you could put paper under it
but it turns out it works perfectly for
raising your computer to eye level so
right now if you're looking at me on on
video you can see that I'm the perfect
level if I took this
away which people make the mistake of
doing I got to talk to Alan dtz he needs
one of these badly so this is without
it so you're looking
up the the looking is not so good and
the looking down is even worse so there
are different heights so depending on
the height of your table and the height
of your
chair um so I got two of them one one is
a little taller than this one so I use
one in the man cave and one here so
watch how much better it is when I raise
it back
up there you
go
perfect now here's uh here's another
one um I got a I don't know what they're
called it like a desk pad or something
desk Pad but I'll show it to
you so it's sort of a a
soft long
thing it just sits
is where you're
working I don't know if you have this
problem but do you have a cold elbow
problem anybody have
that like you want to work on your
kitchen table or something you want to
work on the kitchen table and you put
your laptop there and then you put your
your arms on the surface and it's too
cold well this will keep your arms warm
but also it's
soft so if you're doing a podcast it
