hey everybody
come on in come on in gather round it's
time
for coffee with scott adams many of you
knew that
and today we're going to talk about
well i don't want to ruin it but it
might be one of the best
coffees with scott adams of all time and
if you'd like to enjoy it to the maximum
potential
all you need is a copper bunker glass
attack your jealous system a canteen
drug or flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that's gonna make everything
better it's called
the simultaneous hip and watch it happen
right now
go
that's what i call good stuff
well let's see what's going on today
so according to fox news biden's catch
and release program for migrants
so these are the ones who authorities
are processing and then they're released
without court dates so more than fifteen
thousand have been released into the
wild
but here's my question i'm not sure that
releasing
people after they've been processed in
2021
is exactly the same as it used to be
because you know there's one technology
that's a little different now
i assume that part of the process of
processing
these these folks involves taking a
photograph
is that fair to say does a photograph
get into the government system
every time we process somebody i assume
so
right now once you have a photograph of
somebody who is undocumented
and we have a facial recognition which
is rolling out everywhere
is the ability to just blend into the
economy and disappear without being a
legal citizen
i don't know if that exists anymore i
feel as if
our electronic let's say requirements of
life
now will follow you i mean if they take
your picture you're effectively tagged
it's just like tagging an animal and
releasing because anywhere there's a
camera
you can find them so i would imagine
that although
we don't have all the assets in place to
immediately track every citizen
everywhere
you know it's coming so i'm not so sure
that it matters as much as it used to if
you release people into the country
now i know you don't like it i just i'm
just saying that compared to
the risk of the past the technology
might be coming
to its own and maybe you don't like that
either because of privacy etc
but just stating it as a fact facial
recognition is going to make it really
hard to disappear
right so uh immigration
and facial technology are gonna
bump into each other and that's gonna be
a big story coming up
um new york times is reporting that the
death rate for 2020 was
uh the highest above normal ever
recorded in the country
surpassing even the 1918 flu pandemic
now i put that out there you know new
york times reported it and i tweeted
it and and i asked if the skeptics
pandemic skeptics
have they been convinced you know is
this enough
to finally convince the skeptics that
there was a real pandemic
and it really killed a lot of people and
the answer is
nope not even close
not even close so uh
and i'm always amused at what level
of information it would take to change
anybody's mind
uh and let me tell you the the pushback
number and by the way the pushback is
valid
all right so even though you know it
came from the new york times
it looked like it would be a you know a
pretty big claim to
make if they couldn't back it up
but we have questions
if you look at the 1918 pandemic the
spanish flu
you see that they too had a gigantic
spike in deaths
over the baseline no surprise right
but the following year after the
gigantic
spanish flu spike in deaths
it was way under the death rate so the
amount of the next year that it was
below the average
largely compensated for the amount that
was above the average
the year before so what do we know
about the death rate from coronavirus
so far nothing
we don't know anything because until we
have another full year
we don't know if we're going to have
that same situation where there's a
spike
and then a gigantic below average year
if that happens we're going to be close
to break even
and it's going to look like what is the
theory the
the dried tinder theory
that the people who died of coronavirus
are the people who were very very likely
going to die in the next 12 months from
whatever comorbidity they had
now maybe they didn't know it but
the data might actually show that that's
what what's happening
so can we look at this data and say
my god it's clear that this virus was
extra extra deadly
nope because we don't know how the
numbers come
out and uh importantly
we don't know how many of those deaths
are because of the lockdown
right that's what you want me to say how
many of you were just saying scott
say they're also desk because of the
lockdown
say it say it scott okay i said it
i think everybody agrees that there is
some number of extra deaths
attributed directly to the pandemic
lockdown and extra suicides
extra you know doses of everything
and then here's another question i asked
about the
the spanish flu pandemic in 1918
how well were we counting deaths
because i feel as if a lot of people
probably just died at home
didn't they in 1918 and
if you have a pandemic maybe people end
up in the hospital because it takes a
little while for them to die
and maybe they get counted you see where
i'm going
in 1918 maybe all that happened was
they were good at counting cova deaths
but they were bad at counting every
other kind of death
because maybe just people died at home
and didn't get recorded somehow
i'm just speculating so i don't know if
the 1918
deaths tell us anything and i don't know
if the 2020
tell us anything and they're also not
done because i i think they cut off in
september of 2020.
so every time i think i'm going to learn
something
because data came out have you noticed
it doesn't work
no matter what you do oh we got this new
fresh data
now we know no we don't we don't know
anything
how did you feel about data
five years ago think about it
what was your belief about any kind of
data that you saw
in the news about a big issue five years
ago didn't you think
it's probably true right
you know not always because there were
lots of things that weren't true
always but five years ago you probably
said to yourself well
it's probably true it's in the news
what do you say now don't you say it's
probably not true
i feel like that's a big shift right you
know
there's almost nothing i could see in
the news in terms of new data
that i would actually just believe the
first time i saw it
i would say maybe i might talk about it
like it's true
but in the back of my mind i'd be
thinking maybe maybe not
so that's a that's a big change in
society that we've moved
from believing data that our officials
give to us
versus assuming it's not true and i
believe there's some
extra freedom in that meaning that
maybe it's a good thing maybe it's a
really good thing
that we don't believe official data
maybe that's a big improvement
there's something going on in india and
like everything else in the world we
don't understand it
so india we thought was doing unusually
well
and couldn't explain it but now india is
doing
unusually not well i'm still not sure we
can explain it
i think they may have changed some
social distancing
standards but i don't know if that's the
reason because we never know
but we do know that their hospitals are
overrun
so we know something's happening because
the hospitals are
are you know overfilled and they're
running out of oxygen and stuff
and there's a big question about whether
the united states is doing enough to
help
in terms of vaccine
materials etc now i don't know the
details of that it could be that
it's just not easy to help and we can't
do it
but i gotta think that for the long run
i can't think of anything that would be
better for american
homeland security than making a really
good try to help india
because the only thing that's keeping
china from dominating
the world is that there are other big
countries that
ideally can band together the united
states and
india are natural allies because they
both have
concern about china they're both
democracies
and you know we get along great india in
the united states
so i don't feel that we should be
treating india like a normal
ally like i i don't think we should
treat india like
france and we're good to france france
is a
you know long-term ally i feel like we
should be a little extra good to india
because they're a little extra important
to our long-term future
just as we are to theirs we're sort of
we're sort of
you know bound together by the common
threat of
china i believe so whatever we can do
there
to make sure that the population of
india
goes away saying that the united states
did what it could
you know people understand that
countries will take care of their own
population first
but still it's probably a little bit we
could do that we're not doing
and i feel like i'd like the indian
public to know that the united states
was
squarely on their side like
unambiguously just
on their side so if we could get that
done that would be
that would be good
while i cr i finally crossed a hundred
thousand subscribers on youtube
yay um and i thought i'd give you a
little update
on uh shadow banning
allegedly now the weird thing about
any of this social media shadow banning
or
whatever it is is that you can never
really be sure
right there are all kinds of things that
look like
maybe was this shadow banning i really
can't tell
but i'll just sort of tell you what's
happening
as you know a number of my videos get
demonetized
sometimes taken down more rarely taken
down
but youtube does watch me pretty
carefully
and apparently i've been close enough to
the line of getting canceled that
you know i get demonetized on a regular
basis and that's that's sort of their
warning
that there's something you're doing
that's not quite a hundred percent cool
with
with the rules now almost all
i don't know the ratio 95 percent maybe
of the things they demonetize
get reversed on appeal meaning that they
shouldn't have been demonetized
is it intentional do you think that
getting
demonetized 95 of the time
is just the organ the is nothing but the
algorithm looking for keywords and
there's no human intervention in that
could be because i talk about a lot of
controversial issues
so you know the keyword alone could make
some
advertisers anxious so it could be just
that i wouldn't rule that out
but i was looking at my traffic over the
last year
and you can see that my traffic built
and built and built
through the end of 2020 but just about
the time
when the big conversation was the big
lie do you remember the big lie
that's what the mainstream media decided
was
the term for anybody who is talking
about the election integrity
in the non-approved way so if you had
any
non-approved thoughts about election
integrity
you were in trouble on social media so
my traffic was
up up up up and roughly my hand is about
where the chart was
it was a pretty good climb up up up up
up until all the conversation was about
the integrity of the election
and then straight downhill for several
months
and that as soon as nobody was really
talking about the election integrity
anymore
right back up so
i can't tell if there was any human
involvement
or algorithmic involvement in what was
straight up straight down and then back
up again
but it does coincide with the time that
the the powers that be we're trying to
suppress uh
competing opinions about the credibility
of the election
was it was that a coincidence
was it just because uh the the trump
conversation fell off but then i would
expect my traffic just to go down
forever
right if the only thing that changed
was that trump is out of office so
people who wanted to listen to me for
that purpose
didn't need to but that would just mean
it would go down forever
or flatten but but it's it
it took off again
you just have to wonder right and the
fact that we don't know
if this is natural or manipulated
is really concerning i feel as if
i should know if there are human beings
suppressing what i'm doing or just the
algorithm or just life
in general i have no idea in fact i
don't even have a good guess
of which which one of those things is is
causing the change
so there's a story about a young woman
kirsten
heading she was on a soccer team for
some college and
she refused to kneel as part of the
black lives matter stuff
she was very much in favor of the
concept
that you know the the black lives matter
as a concept
but did not like the organization and
didn't think that she wanted to
participate
so she didn't kneel and she got kicked
off the team
for not kneeling since when is kneeling
mandatory in the united states
seriously you know lots of times when i
look at
people's behavior i ask myself would i
do that
if i were in that situation would i be
the one person who
got kicked off the team and the answer
is yeah
yeah i would have been her so
there is a really really big difference
between
hey we'd like you to kneel we're mad at
you that you didn't
and you have to the the moment it
becomes required
required to kneel to an organization or
really in the united states you're
required to get on your knees
to an idea i don't care how good the
idea is
that's not happening so let me uh
let me say as uh full-throatedly as i
can
that i support this kirsten heating i
guess
hemming or heating so yeah
and i would hire her in a heartbeat if i
were hiring whatever
it is that she's going to look for a job
because
that's the person you want you want the
person who is going to say
yeah now you've gone too far i'm with
you on the concept
but i'm not going to get on my knees
because you're going to make me
it's just not going to happen so yeah i
would have walked down to the team
as well you know twitter has become this
weird
alternate reality where a number of
people that i follow and follow me
are in the the skeptical camp and
it is amazing to see the data that
the skeptics you know put on twitter
versus everybody else
it's just completely different worlds
and the data
if you didn't know any better if you
weren't good at sort of recognizing bs
it looks just as good they're opposites
you know one will say that the sky is
blue the other
other says the sky is orange and they'll
just be at the same time about the same
data as if
as if we can't tell the difference and
we can't
i i actually don't know sometimes what's
true
but i've started to block the skeptics
who
um who have been so wrong for so long
you know i say this often but the people
who are doubting
the official narrative are
you know patriots and heroes and you
need them even when they're wrong
you need the skeptics even when they're
completely wrong
you just have to have that that tension
but we've reached a point
where some of the skeptics i'm not going
to name names
but some of them have been so wrong for
so long
that i just can't i can't see them
anymore i just have to
block them out of my life so you may
disappear if you're
following me if if you've if you've gone
too far
right i'm still okay with the people
doubting
mask effectiveness
if you want that's fine
um but you know there are some things
that are just
so beyond proven now that uh i don't
think
skepticism is warranted but it's a
judgment call
here's a update on uh propaganda
some people call it news huffington post
ran this headline
uh people are tweeting it around cops
kill
six people in 24 hours after the chauvin
conviction don't you feel that headline
needed a little context
that the police kill six people in 24
hours after the chauvin
conviction sort of makes you feel
as if
as if the the police were just going
wild and shooting black people
nothing like that actually is you know
indicated
but uh boy the huffington post doesn't
even try
to be anything but propaganda
so i'm wondering if the fda should
require warning labels on news
what do you think of that and i'm not
sure if they have that power but
um let's just talk about this now we've
talked about the fact that science has
determined that watching only the news
on one side of the political aisle
gives you brain damage that's the actual
word that they use the scientists do
brain damage because you can't you can't
uh discern reality from fake news
if you're only watching one side it
doesn't matter which side
all the only the right or only the left
now i've said before that the people on
the right
tend to be automatically exposed to the
news on the left
because that's in the atmosphere it's
just sort of around all the time
but it doesn't work the other way the
people on the left will never watch fox
news
they'll never click on a link they'll
just never see it
so they're not going to watch bright
bars they're not going to watch anything
on the right
so although both sides can be silly
if you're only watching one side you do
get brain damage
and i wonder if something like the fda
could put a warning label on the news
and why not if you knew
that consuming only news from one source
gave you brain damage
and again there's no hyperbole here
literally
actually those words coming from the
scientists
brain damage shouldn't you label it
now i don't think the label should go
too far because then you'd be impinging
on
you know maybe freedom of speech a
little bit too much you know
you don't want the government putting
too much pressure on freedom of speech
but truth and labeling is good telling
us when there's a legitimate danger
i will still watch it or not watch it i
still have a choice
you know you're not taking my right to
watch it away
but what if what if cnn and the other
i just used cnn as my example you could
apply this to all the news stations
what if they had to run a little notice
that said
consuming news from only one source
or one cluster of sources because you
know what that means you know only the
left only the right
or one cluster of similar sources can
cause brain damage
and make you less capable of functioning
as an adult
wouldn't that be useful imagine
consuming the news
with a warning before that they just
have to run that says much of this news
is unlikely to be true because
unfortunately much of the news turns out
later to not be true
but does the public know that i don't
think the public knows that
i think some of the public knows it but
let's put a warning label on the news
and i would put it on all the news i
wouldn't i wouldn't discriminate and say
it's just cnn or msnbc
you'd have to do it on all of them
that's my take um so i guess there was
some big ufc
fight last night i'm not really i don't
really follow the sport
and the reason i don't follow it is i'm
just not a fan of any sport
that guarantees brain damage for lots of
people
i guess that's my theme today brain
damage and
um you know i'm i'm sensitive to the
argument that it's a free country and
people can take whatever risks they want
but i really don't understand this one
like i don't understand how you can
watch
people get brain damage as entertainment
i've watched some pretty bad things as
entertainment
but i can't watch people getting brain
damage as entertainment
i watched a clip yesterday and i don't
know if this was the fight or it was the
fight before the fight
but there were two two female combatants
and one of them you know they were
facing off and one of them does this
devastating kick
to the head of the other one and you see
the other one just
wandering around in a daze and can
barely stand up
and and this daze lasts
you know a long time in at least in
those terms a long time
it's obvious i think
can somebody give me a fact check here
if somebody gets
a strong blow in the face or head
and they're walking around like they're
confused
that is brain damage right i mean we'll
call it a concussion
or something else but isn't it brain
damage
and and everybody's cheering yay
that was magnificent let's replay that
all i saw was somebody get brain damage
like
forever forever
that doesn't go away you know when
your concussion wears off
you still have the brain damage right
it's only a question of
how much if you haven't looked into this
whole brain damage situation
it's a big deal it's a big deal
and we we act like it's not so
if you want to say it's a free country
and people want to damage their brains
for your entertainment and their profit
i don't know maybe that's okay it's a
free country
but i don't know how you can watch it
like i really i don't
i don't understand it at all but it's
you know personal
personal differences um
so biden has a somewhat surprisingly
recognized the armenian genocide by
the turkish you know historical state
and if you don't know about this the
the general sense of it is that around
world war ii
i'm sorry world war one uh
turkey was getting rid of armenians and
shipping them off to
death camps or camps where they died or
they're murdering them and
and uh basically it was genocide
not basically it was genocide
and i guess most nations agree on this
but in turkey they treat
they in turkey they teach their own
students it didn't happen
so if you're a student in turkey you
will literally be taught it didn't
happen
now given that turkey is a nato ally
right
and you know we don't want problems with
turkey because we need to work with them
it was kind of ballsy for biden to
you know put the hammer down on him and
i'm going to say
again you know
you've watched me say good things about
trump when he was in office
and some criticisms so i'm going to be
i'll try to be at least a little
even-handed i think this should have
been done by trump
i don't know why trump didn't do this
this feels like a biden
success that was not a trump success and
it should have been
somebody said he did that's not true
uh no trump did not do this
um so but i also have to wonder if
there's anything behind it
you know is there anything about our our
relationship with turkey
or anything about the armenian american
you know group or anything i feel like
there's something more to the story
about why it happened because biden's
kind of cautious
and i don't think he causes trouble
unless
unless he's got a reason so i feel like
there's more to know about this story
but
on the surface i would say i agree with
him
now a personal note
[Music]
is that i own some stock
in a turkish company
that i thought was going to be a good
stock for let's say
the 20 or 30 year years that i thought
i'd hold it
which was the turkish cell phone company
now the
the company itself is doing great except
that the
foreign exchange you know the the
turkish currency just
went to hell so anything you invest
there is a loser
so it's way underwater but um
at this point i feel like now that the
united states has recognized
the armenian genocide and that turkey is
still denying it
i feel like i just don't want my money
there anymore
so i'll probably pull it out on monday
just for
patriotic reasons really i'm not sure
it'll be a bad investment
in 10 years but who knows so that i
don't make any uh
investment advice so don't see any
investment
advice in this i'm just telling you i'm
no longer comfortable having any money
in turkey feels like a bad place to have
money
just my personal opinion um
i love the few that cnn and fox news
have
where it feels like everyday fox news
hosts are being called racist by cnn
and every day that fox news or people
are calling cnn as propagandists
and i feel as yeah they they found a
business model where they can make money
off of each other's flaws
so part of the content of each of those
news networks
is insulting the other one it's kind of
clever that they
they managed to weaponize their hatred
of each other and their flaws
but it's working so good for them um
i would like to make a point which i
made in my book
how to fail almost everything and still
win big it's about
optimizers versus simplifiers
and i think it explains what's going on
with the
tony fauci situation uh
situation meaning that uh anthony fauci
is of course a technical medical
not medical but you know an expert on
pandemics etc
and he's been um
telling us that we got to keep our masks
on even if we're
even if we're vaccinated now that's an
optimizer
so an optimizer is somebody who doesn't
want to leave anything undone
if you can get everything done do it
even if it's more complicated
whereas a simplifier would say you know
we'd like to do
everything but it's it's going to be too
hard so let's just pick the simplest
thing we can do
that's also big and and see if we can
get at least one thing done right
and i would say that leaders tend to be
simplifiers
i'm going to make a generality here that
somebody who's a leader or president for
example
or a governor would be a simplifier
because they have to be
you can't be a good leader if you're
complicating your messages you just got
to be a
trump-like simplifier reagan was a good
simplifier
but scientists are optimizers scientists
are
optimizers and so it's pretty obvious
why you get a difference
tony fauci is saying if you wanted to
optimize
you know a reduction of risk you would
get the vaccination but you would also
wear your mask
and part of it is so that other people
you know
don't feel free that they could take
their masks off and maybe they're not
vaccinated
and um i think that dr nicole sapphire
said it best wrapping up this point in a
tweet
and she said this the best strategy to
overcome covet
19 vaccine hesitancy is to assure the
public that vaccines will lead to
normalizing our lives
that would be a simple message right
unfortunately the cdc dr fauci
biden have all missed the mark with
messaging and their lack of
their lack of liberation recommendations
adds to the hesitancy
so the point here being that if you
could say to people
get your vaccinations and you can take
your mask off
it's simple right now
is it true that we know for sure
that taking your mask off would be okay
or okay enough the answer is there's a
little bit of uncertainty but we do know
that the risk would be smallish
and so as dr sapphire says
and i agree if you're trying to get
people to take the vaccination
and that's the most important thing
let's say from the perspective of
our government percentage of people
getting vaccinated is the most
important thing you can disagree about
vaccinations but
just follow along with the point if it's
the most important thing
you don't want to work against yourself
by saying you still have to wear masks
when you're done
even if that would be a little bit
better we think maybe
not so sure a little bit you're way
better
letting people die it
to that tiny little risk because the
greater benefit of getting more
vaccinations according to the government
would be much better
somebody says matthew says i'm spitting
facts
i don't know what that means sixty
percent of new cases had the vaccination
i doubt that's true um
but there is a period between the
vaccination and when you're
covered so that that might be part of
any data problems there
uh somebody says all the evidence shows
the coveted shots are dangerous
now this is this is that uh two worlds
thing
you can live on twitter in a certain
world
in which all of the information says
that the shots are
more bad than good but you can live in a
different world
and which is unambiguously true that the
vaccinations are good for you
in the world those worlds are
completely um they're complete
you can just go into either of those
worlds and live in it like the other one
doesn't even exist
so if there's somebody on here who says
all of the data says that the shots are
dangerous
you're in a bubble maybe you picked the
right bubble that would be lucky
but just be aware that the smartest
people in the world disagree with you
sorry that's just the fact the smartest
most well-informed people in the world
are overwhelmingly
pro-vaccination overwhelmingly
not even close so if you're living in a
little twitter
social media world in which it seems
that vaccinations are a bad idea you're
not
seeing the smart people you you seem to
have found a bubble in which
there are some smart people but they
would be in
the skeptical uh camp
all right it's like wearing a helmet in
a car or somebody says
yeah so the point is whether or not
being vaccinated
is a complete reduction of risk or not
you should still simplify and act like
it is
because that's how to get to the get to
the finish line
better all right
somebody says the smartest people want
to enslave us
well it's still optional right
if the smartest people say um
you know x has a risk so far
we still have some options about it
right
now
shots won't prevent so there's somebody
here saying that the shots won't prevent
kovid 19. you really have a data problem
all right if you believe that shots oh
in fact i was seen this morning one of
the people that i
i had to block was presenting
graphs that show that the number of
infections skyrockets
after the vaccines roll out now
i don't know of anything that is less
likely to be true than that
now and they have official sources
official sources
that show a whole different world than
the rest of the world is seeing
the rest of the world sees that when the
shots roll out
the number of infections plunges united
states
israel etc but there's a whole other
world where they're seeing
exactly the opposite graphs that as soon
as you get a vaccination you get
you know you get the disease and the
number of infections skyrockets
they can't both be true and i feel very
confident in saying that
vaccinations are not causing more covet
and i feel very confident in saying that
we do know by now
that they work now if you're worried
about long-term
long-term complications that's something
we don't know about
right there's no way to know because
it's not the long term yet
but certainly we know that they uh
vastly reduce the risk of getting covert
we do know that
so if there's anybody here who still
thinks that the vaccinations just don't
work
you are really lost my friends
i mean you're really lost because
overwhelmingly the smart people know
they work
all right um
so i went over to msnbc and sure enough
um they've got a big article there about
the biggest hoax of 2020 or one of the
two biggest
and still they're saying a year later
that trump uh recommended
drinking or ingesting uh disinfectants
they're still saying that as of today
msnbc is still telling its audience
that trump recommended drinking
disinfectants
now that's the most debunked lie in the
world if anybody's here who doesn't know
it
just google heal light
h-e-a-l-i-g-h-t
that's the technology that is the uv
light that's injected into the body
via via trachea you know a what do you
call it a ventilator-like device into
your trachea
and that was in the news and around
social media at the same time that trump
was talking about it i had tweeted about
it i talked about it it was a real thing
and he talked about it as uv light he
clearly was aware of that technology
whether that becomes a good technology
or not
probably not i mean most things they
test don't work out
but it was a real thing and and msnbc is
said that he was talking about bleach or
disinfectant or something
just amazing it's amazing that this that
this can happen
like right in front of you so the the
propaganda is just
over the top and i feel like there was
something i was going to tell you that i
forgot but maybe i didn't oh yes this
um given that i've reached 100 000
subscribers
on youtube which i think was kind of a
kind of a tight rope between getting
canceled and
not getting cancelled but so far i
haven't been cancelled
and i was inspired by the story
that i told you about the young woman
who wouldn't kneel
and she sort of inspired me a little bit
honestly
to do the following tweets
all right and i tweeted
this we'll see if this gets me canceled
i said as a general rule
i try to i try to not care about anyone
who acts as if they don't care about
themselves
that's why i don't care about anyone who
resists arrest
it's still a tragedy but it won't ever
be a priority of mine
i do care about ending systemic racism
by teachers unions so that's in my tweet
now let me tell you the technique i had
to use to keep myself from getting
cancelled here if you don't know how to
do
this don't do what i did
because you could so easily get
cancelled for a tweet
like this if you don't have enough
technique so let me tell you the
technique that's in it
number one i did not say that i don't
care about black lives
that would get you canceled because of
course i do care about black lives
number two i did not say all lives
matter
because that'll get you canceled
so the you know i stayed away from the
you know the third rails that are the
obvious ones
but i'm still in dangerous territory
right because i'm saying very clearly
that i don't care about anyone
who is resisting rest and the theory is
why should i care about someone who's
not acting as if they even care about
themselves
i get that it's a tragedy it's a tragedy
for the person it's a tragedy
for the police officer you know nothing
good comes from a shooting
tragedy for the family so it's
definitely a tragedy but it's not my
tragedy
and if i'm going to rank all the
tragedies to care about
it's going to be close to last you have
to at least hear about yourself
before you can even come to me and ask
me to care about you
and although i can't read your mind if
you're
acting exactly like you don't care about
your own life
i don't care about you i really don't
so when i watch any you know police
shooting of somebody resisting arrest
i just don't care i really don't
now i understand this tragedy and
i def actually i do care about the
family so i care about their surviving
family
because they didn't do anything right
the family was just minding their own
business
so it's a tragedy for them but i don't
care about the perpetrator
because they they took that they took
that away
you know if you're not going to act just
at least act like you care about
yourself
then i'll get involved i'll care about
you too but i'm not going to help people
who can't do the
the smallest thing to help themselves
that's just a complete waste of time
has anybody here ever tried to help
somebody who was a lost
cause how did it work out
in the comments let me see how many of
you have tried it
have you tried to help somebody who was
just too far gone
and you just wasted your time just
nothing good came from it
how many of you have been in that
situation look at the comments
yup yup never works out yep you give up
yes
uh it red pilled me uh oh somebody says
it worked out good
every once in a while many times yes
yes it didn't yes yes yes save your
breath yeah
i would say the minimum requirement of
wasting your not wasting your time let
me re-state that
the minimum requirement to care about
other people enough to help them out
is that you have to see they're doing
something for themselves
like that that they have some intention
of things working out
there are tons of people who have no
intention of success
and it's very obvious they have no
intention of succeeding
no intention of being a good citizen
and what can you do
that's interesting the best advice you
ever gave me was on
deciding um let me restate that advice
so uh usually here is saying the best
advice i ever gave
was about deciding and now what that was
was the difference between wanting
something and deciding to have it
right the people resisting arrest and
getting hurt
they want to be treated right and they
want to be safe and they want to
probably want to live but they haven't
decided
because if you decide it's got the
seller
so i can't tell you how many times over
my career
somebody has called me a sellout now let
me let me
summarize by saying uh that that comment
sort of labels you as a idiot
because you understand that public
people are selling things for a living
right
that we're all selling something what
what is styling out
means because
you have my honest opinion you know that
i've probably lost a
third of my income by giving my honest
opinions
so what exactly is selling out
i'll tell you what it means everybody
who uses that term
is so low on the awareness level as a
human being
that you're somewhere between stupid and
all right so try to improve your game
criticism's great i don't mind it at all
you know i've told you that a good
criticism is like money in the bank
if somebody criticizes me in a way that
i can change something
and prove it i was like whoa cha-ching
that's a good criticism i'll take it
but scott's selling out
i tell you it's such a low level of
of criticism that uh
i just don't know how you you can wake
up and keep yourself fed
i mean really you're you're barely human
at that level
uh so i have a i have a suggestion
for all the conservatives who are tired
of being called
racists for just having an opinion on
pretty much anything
and i'm going to get this this comes
from
a classmate of mine in seventh grade
uh her name was debbie uh i doubt she's
watching this
now debbie was one of the uh the
cue girls you know the attractive girls
who who tend to be the mean girls
because they can get away with it
you know they're popular and they're
attractive and one of the things that
the mean girls did
is uh and it was especially devastating
at that age if you tried to talk to them
and you were not one of the cool
cool boys they would mock whatever you
said
this way and i'll give you i'll give you
my impression
so if a guy say a you know
seventh grade boy came up to debbie or
one of
her friends and said hey hey debbie
would you
would you like to hang out with me this
weekend debbie would look at you and in
front of her friends would say
oh you'd like to hang out with me this
weekend
and she would just say what you said but
like somebody with
brain damage and it was
devastating because there's nothing you
could do to it you just
you just like shrink away you're like
all right
you just you just get out of there it's
just absolutely devastating
and i was thinking about it because you
know every day cnn is blaming
blaming a fox news host of being a
racist for one thing or another
and it would just be hilarious if the
way all the conservatives handled those
accusations
is the way debbie did so that when you
know let's say uh
jim whatever his name is on
on cnn so let's say he's doing an
opinion piece and he says
uh that cartoonist has said this or that
and so he's a racist and my response
would just be
uh well jim jim had a quote today he
said
oh jim acosta yes uh jim acosta said
and just leave it there don't don't even
deal with the facts just go
for he's a racist
and just every time they say it just do
the same
debbie mean girl and just leave it there
never ever do with any of the content
you know that mocking is powerful right
if you haven't been mocked by a 14 year
old girl when you're a 14 year old boy
you haven't been mocked let me tell you
that's like the gold standard of mocking
really good stuff
powerful so uh
i'm watching some of you do it in the in
the comments and i could tell that
i could tell that this is popular uh
critical race theory
yeah president trump was the gold
standard of mocking yeah you're right he
probably was better
all right so a lot of you are laughing
about that all right we'll try it out
and uh the next time one of my uh
critics
uh comes after me i'll do a little video
in which i'll respond to my critics
with just
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
