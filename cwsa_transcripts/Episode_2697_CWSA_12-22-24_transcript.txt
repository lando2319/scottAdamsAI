he it's coming for you you don't even
have to come for the show it's coming
for
you let me get my comments working
here
[Music]
excellent good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called the coffee with
Scott Adams and while those other
podcasters are sleeping in on Sunday I'm
with you giving you that free
entertainment that you demand but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a cup or mug a
glass of tanker chel a sign a canteen
sug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine head of the day
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh that's
good that's
good well we've got news and we've got
fake news today we got all kinds of news
real stuff fake stuff you know the usual
stuff so there's a study according to sa
poost that each additional fast food
meal you eat per week is associated with
a 4% higher likelihood of
depression
so 4% higher depression rate if you eat
at least one fast food mual per week
does that sound like real science to
you or does it sound
like backwards science backwards
science well I can only speak for myself
here but I I suspect this might be
generalizable I when I ate fast food
when I was a younger adult um I don't do
it anymore but when I did I would do it
for the
enjoyment i' do it for the dopamine I
didn't really do it for the food it was
because it just felt so good so who
would likely eat unhealthy food just to
make themselves feel better probably
somebody
who's you know trending toward depressed
or sad so I've got a feeling that the
reason people eat it is because they're
already feeling not
100% so I'm not so sure it's the food
makes them
sad so much as being sad makes you eat
things that are unhealthy but it sure
feels good when you do it now this is
part of my
hypothesis the it's the pleasure unit
Theory I call it a theory but it's a
hypothesis and the idea is that
everybody needs a minimum amount of
enjoyment or else it's just not worth
living and if you can't get enjoyment in
legal and healthy ways you will get it
another way and this might be one of
those examples so I think it might be at
least partially backward science so some
robots are learning to maybe determine
how humans feel emotional state by
touching so they they figured out how to
get sort of a galvanic skin response uh
mechanism in the the fingers of a robot
this is all
experimental but uh the idea is that
apparently you can tell people's
emotional state by their galonic skin
response
now uh this is according to Live
Science
and maybe but here's what I
think why don't robots do it the way
people do it because people can tell
people's emotional state we look at
their body language we look at their
eyes we look at their face we look at
their smile we listen to the exact words
they
choose and those are all patterns so
basically humans have pattern
recognition and the pattern
recognition um allows us to know how
other people are feeling unless they're
trying really hard to hide it from
us so I would think that the robots are
100% likely to deal with humans as
emotional creatures because they'll just
know what that means and they'll know
how to deal with it and they'll
recognize the patterns and they'll see
if your the irises of your eyes are
larger or smaller they'll look for all
those little cues by the way it's the
same thing I learned in
hypnosis when you learn hypnosis you
learn to read people's micro changes you
know tiny changes in skin tone and you
know eyes and stuff like that it's very
useful it's it's a learnable
skill um according to zero heads Trump
says they plans to continue Aid to
Ukraine but he's going to he wants to
raise NATO's spending limit to 5% from
2% so at the moment NATO countries are
supposed to donate 2% of their
GDP toward NATO and and Trump wants to
pump that up and I assume that means
that the United States would save some
money or would
it because if we if we spend 5% on NATO
that's just more spending but the
critics will say wait a minute I thought
we voted for Trump to end this war you
did but but but he says he's going to
continue funding the ukrainians to fight
he did did there's no conflict there yes
he's going to negotiate an end to the
war yes he wants to escalate the
war
yes because that's how you
negotiate it's just negotiating so
Russia needs to feel like he's in it for
the long run and if they don't give him
the deal he wants he'll just keep
fighting and we'll just keep sending
drones over there and uh NATO will up
its spending and we'll just grind uh
grind the Russian army down
now
clearly clearly Trump would rather
negotiate an end to the
war but you don't get an end to the war
if you say I'm going to tell the
ukrainians they can't fight
anymore that's sort of a bad beginning
to a negotiation the best beginning to a
negotiation is we're going to go harder
at you and that's what he's saying so if
you don't understand Trump as a
negotiator everything looks backwards it
all looks upside down you're like what I
thought he was going to negotiate peace
why why is he gonna fund the war oh it's
all the same thing it's just
negotiating uh you heard the story about
Russia allegedly was going to launch
some cancer vaccine in 2025 news weeks
reporting on this so here's what we know
it's not a
vaccine so so first thing you need to
know about the cancer vaccine from
Russia it's not a vaccine so it's not
intended to prevent you from getting
anything it's meant to treat people who
already have something and the described
methodology is that they would uh they'd
have to take a little biopsy of your
tumor and then they would concoct the
vaccination to be specific to you and
then they give it to you and it would
fight your cancer they say but I did
hear just one uh anecdotal report from
somebody in a Russian Hospital saying
they don't know anything about it so I
don't think I would place a big
bet that this is real or that it would
work but it's out there we'll see
meanwhile
Rumble which some of you are watching me
on right now the rumble uh platform they
got 775 million investment from tether
tether's a crypto uh outfit so according
to reclaim the
net and uh that's a lot of
money how how often does any any company
get $775 million investment so if you
were worried that Rumble wasn't going to
make it because it's sort of a free
speech you know one of the last places
you can find it um looks like they're in
pretty good shape right now I I should
tell you that I'm an investor in
Rumble um that's not why I'm telling you
the story but I am an investor so keep
that in
mind according to axios Democrat voters
are five times more likely to exclude
family members because of
politics now fortunately um five times
is not as much as it could have been so
23% of Democrats are willing to
exclude Republicans in their family from
family
events but Republicans only 5% of
Republicans would do the same only 5%
versus 23% and independents are in the
middle of course
11%
um yeah that's pretty uh that's pretty
messed
up wonder if that's true do you buy do
you buy that 23%
I feel like it's I feel like it might be
more I think 23% might be the ones who
admit it I feel like there might be
people who say I'm not going to invite
you but then there must be other people
who simply don't invite you they don't
tell anybody they don't talk to a
pollster but they're just not
comfortable being around you anymore I
think this is low 23% I'll bet it's
closer to half if I had to if I had to
guess well in the fake news category the
news is saying today this is fake news
by the way that Jeff Bezos is going to
marry his fiance Lauren Sanchez and
what's being called a lavish $600
million Aspen
wedding so uh Bill Amman was the first
person I saw calling this out because he
can do
math do you know what's wrong with most
news people can't do math so they don't
know what is real real news and what's
not real news as Bill akman pointed out
you couldn't possibly spend $600 million
unless unless you bought unless you
bought a house for every person who
attend
it no it's not 600
million if you saw that story and for
even one second for even one second you
believe that Jeff Bezos was going to
spend $600 million on a wedding well
he's already weighed in and Jeff bezo
says there's not a single thing about it
that's
true which opens the possibility that
there's no wedding at all but it
definitely debunks the 600 million part
no there's no $600 million
weddings how did anybody believe
that no and um yeah so we don't know if
the wedding is on but certainly the 600
million part is off I suspect the aspect
part isn't real either because Bezos
said it was basically all false so don't
believe
that I saw the best
response to the uh the narrative that
the Democrats are trying to use that uh
Elon Musk is oh he's the real president
he's president musk oh you know they're
trying to drive a wedge between musk and
Trump and here's the best uh that I saw
know I didn't write down where this came
from so I'm stealing this from an
influencer online whose name I didn't
get uh but here's the
persuasion we did vote for we did vote
for Trump and we did vote for Trump to
pick his
advisors yeah we did vote for Trump and
his
advisers now technically technically you
didn't vote for Elon Musk
but you totally voted for Donald Trump
and whoever he wants to work with and he
wants to work with Elon
Musk and you knew that you knew that you
knew that before you voted so surprise
you did vote for Elon Musk you didn't
vote him for president but you voted for
him to do exactly what he's doing in
effect you voted for him not technically
but in effect so that's the best reframe
I've seen on this yeah yeah we vot we
always vote for the advisers we voted
for V we voted for JD Vance even though
he's vice president you know you sort of
vote for him uh we voted for tulsey
gabard we voted for RFK Jr to do his
thing yeah I can tell you for sure that
in my mind when I voted I was voting for
the
team were you or or did you think of
yourself as voting for one
person cuz you don't t technically
you're voting for one person but I mean
the the appeal of it was who he could
bring to the game so yeah we voted for
him we we absolutely voted for musos
indirectly CNN's ratings continues to
make news how bad they are I would hate
to be in the news
business but the news is about how bad
your business
is so CNN probably doesn't cover the
news about how bad their business is but
uh the ratings for their key demographic
you 25 to 54 year old people uh the CNN
average only 93,000
viewers um so that must be per show or
per hour I
guess
93,000 do you know how many people are
going to watch this live
stream probably
100,000 if you count the audience
on Spotify and you count Rumble and you
count the X feed and you count YouTube
and you count locals so on multiple
platforms probably it the live the live
audience will be lower but the nature of
podcasts is they get
replayed CNN largely doesn't get
replayed at least the whole show doesn't
get replayed um so is my podcast as big
as CNN no because here's what they never
tell you when they tell you that CNN's
ratings are low they're leaving out the
main part of their business
model the main part of their business
model is
Clips if you if you follow the news at
all you're going to see tons of Clips
taken from their shows so when you w
when the live show of CNN is on I don't
think even CNN expects you to watch it
but they probably do expect you to be on
social media and see the clips and and
all that so they probably make more
money from the clips and then you know
they're they have advertising but as
you've learned uh especially the Pharma
advertisers are really just trying to
make sure that CNN doesn't say bad
things about them so they
advertise um but I think they make most
of their money I'll take a fact check on
this but I think the cable news makes
most of their money by charging the
cable
providers for their content so even
though you pay just for cable access the
cable company pays for a lot of their
content and they're paying CNN to be on
cable because if you offer a cable and
you don't have a CNN it would look like
it's an incomplete product so they kind
of have to do
it anyway
um so whenever you see these news
numbers there's always something missing
that's important and what's
missing is that they don't get much
revenue from the live
viewership and uh it's about clips and
it's about charging the cable providers
all right um the uh the what's up with
that I think it's a blog or a web page
by Anthony
Watts um he had a article out says Hey
media remember in 2017 when an iceberg
in Antarctica freaked everybody out so
there was some giant iceberg in 2017
that I guess it cleaved itself off and
and then everybody said oh no climate
change is melting all the icebergs we're
all dead and then see that was
2017 in
2024 the current understanding is that
was just a normal thing that's been
happening all the time it has has
nothing to do with probably anything it
was literally just Baseline it was the
most ordinary thing that happens all the
time so so if you thought in 2017 my God
the world is
melting you were
wrong uh climate change was most of the
news about climate change is fake
so I think it's probably true the humans
add to the heat of the
world um whether that makes a difference
or we're going to care about it in the
long run or there's nothing we can do
about it those are all the important
questions but boy I would say the news
about it is almost always
fake whether or not there's anything to
it you know whe whether or not there's
any truth to it the news is about it is
just about always fake because the news
is looking for stories to support a
narrative and there's always someone
who's happy to give it to
him meanwhile Lara Trump who people
thought was going to run was going to
run for the Senate I think she announced
she was looking into it um for Florida
she withdrew so she wants to withdraw
herself from consideration for being a
future senator for Florida she didn't
give a reason but I'm going to
speculate my speculation is that it's
not really an ideal
time um if she has younger kids to be in
a job that pretty much would absorb you
and make you move out of town and fly
around the world and I don't know it
probably just doesn't work with
lifestyle is my guess so I think she
probably thinks she could win and she
probably thinks that she'd be good at it
which I think so I'm going to say
probably later you know but it if the
kids get older and they're kind of
self-sufficient maybe she takes a second
look at it so we'll
see um I'm just guessing I'm just
guessing that lifestyle and you know
keeping the family intact is is a higher
priority but that's just a
guess
um so you heard the story about uh
representative K Granger so this is
somebody who's been in a public public
life for a long time and
uh is a representative in Congress but
hasn't been there for 6 months and when
they finally figured out where she was
she was in a Memory Care Facility so
she's completely checked out she's not
coming back and apparently her interns
have been posting so it seemed like she
was you know on the job because her
interns were posting on
X and the funniest thing is the interns
posted something about how great the
interns were in her office with a
picture of the all posing with her must
have been from the past so the interns
were running the account were
complimenting themselves in the
account those are P I like those
inters as soon as I find out that they
were using their their privilege access
to a representative's account to
compliment themselves I said to myself H
approved yeah that's like something I
might do if I were an
intern anyway so I don't know if we have
a real government or maybe they're all
in Memory Care by
now so there was a sighting in the
southeast United States something in the
sky they don't know if it was a
satellite burning up uh and crashing or
if it was some kind of a satellite I'm
sorry a meteor or satellite they don't
know but I guess people could see it in
Kansas Arkansas Tennessee Missouri parts
of Louisiana
so I saw the video of it and it really
looks
scary because it's you know this flaming
particles coming through the sky that
looked pretty big and it was in multiple
parts so as far as I know we still don't
know what that
was but if I were a meteor Chaser let me
give you a little Financial advice if
you could be the first one to find a
meteor and it's not on somebody else's
you know private property the those
meteors are worth a lot of money did you
know
that yeah they're they're worth you know
it might be worth a million dollars if
there was a big chunk of
it or actually a lot more so we'll see
if I if I if I saw where that was
Landing I would have been driving toward
that thing so fast because it's
basically just free money laying on the
ground if it's intact if any if any of
the parts came through big enough that
there's a nice
chunk well you probably heard the story
that a US jet military jet got shot down
by a uh military
destroyer in the Red Sea now I didn't
see as part of the story what the uh
it's an fa 18 so one of our Advanced
Jets um Super
Hornet uh anyway so it got shot down in
what they call Friendly
Fire which is sort of the worst name for
your co-workers trying to kill you
accidentally but uh the good news as
somebody said is our apparently our
anti-aircraft
defenses are really good because I think
I think it only took one missile to take
it down um but the pilots got out so the
there were two people in the plane or
the Jet and apparently they ejected in
time so I think we're going to find out
more about this
story um on the surface it's sort of a
perfect bad anecdote for the Biden
Administration you know that you by the
end of the Biden Administration the
military was shooting at each other you
know it just it's a little too
perfect as as a little uh you know as a
little punctuation at the end of the
sentence so I'm going to wait on this
one there might be more to this story I
I feel a I have a suspicion that there's
a little bit more to it and maybe we'll
never know but I don't know um maybe
it's a Dei problem we'll never
know Trump provocatively has put out a
notice on social media that Panama Canal
either needs to lower its prices for
American ships or uh maybe we should
take it back now you might not know if
you're not old enough
that the Panama Canal was built by
Americans uh I think 35,000 Americans
died building it mostly from
mosquitoes uh Trump was mentioning that
statistic recently and then Jimmy Carter
sold the entire Canal
to Panama for
$1 I think he just didn't want to be
colonizing pan Panama so he said all
right even though it's very very
profitable
and even though we built it at a great
personal expense it's not our country so
you know we're going to turn it over to
you and I understand I mean I I get why
cardier did it you know we we just don't
want to be that kind of country where
we're just basically colonizing you know
the middle of Panama um on the other
hand what happened was Panama grossly
increased the price for passage freed
ship and I did see that they could
charge as much as
$450,000 for one
ship nearly half a million dollar just
to pass and our ships are paying
that so Trump is basically saying if you
don't want us to take it back which
wouldn't be hard
militarily um you're going to have to
lower those prices at least for American
ships and again the way you should see
this is as
negotiation did did Trump just declare
war on Panama sort of yeah sort of he
kind of did but it's it's in the context
of
negotiations so I like
that uh Jack bobc is saying that uh I
think he's involved in putting together
a class action suit for the January
Sixers and the class action would be
against the committee the January 6
committee who may have done unethical
things uh maybe even illegal we don't
know yet uh that would cause some of
them to go to jail in a context in which
they normally would not be going to
jail um so you know how do you know how
often you've been bugged by the fact
that somebody will get they'll become
Innocent by the law and then there'll be
a legal case so the the the private
lawsuit takes all their money even
though they you know may may not have
done the crime or they're or they were
not found guilty of the crime um I hate
it when it works against my
interests where where I think come on
you know the law found them innocent
it's not fair that they get sued when
they found when they were innocent on a
legal sense and yeah you probably all
know that the reason that you can find
somebody
liable uh and have to pay even though
they were found not guilty of the very
crime is that there's a different
standard so if it's
military uh the entire Jury has to agree
that they're guilty if it's a um civil
suit we just suing them for hurting you
and some way um then it just has to be a
majority of the of the jury so it's much
easier so and Accord and uh Jack babic
is saying that they would start with Liz
chaining now I asked my uh digital
device what is the net worth of Liz
Cheney he said 14 million but of course
nobody really knows that stuff nobody
nobody really knows anybody's net
worth I've been I've been uh looking at
my own net worth as estimated by social
media for the last 25 years not even
close I I don't know where they come up
with those numbers nobody asked me I'm
literally the only person who knows my
net worth literally the only one you
know there's no financial institution
who has a good view of it nobody and
nobody asked me so so when I when I
check social media for somebody else's
net worth it could be five times that it
could be one of that it's you know that
so that's the that's what you have to
look at
now although I do assum she's doing okay
um what do you think of
that so separate from the question of
whether those lawsuits would succeed and
I suspect they would actually I think
they
would do you think that this is the
right
approach I'm going to say
yes because I'm not so sure that they
that there would be any success with a
criminal trial because that's tough but
I'll bet you would have success with a
Civil Trial and if it in the unlikely
event It produced any money then that
would go to the J Sixers after after
legal costs of course
so I I guess I'm in favor of this I
guess I'm in favor there there has to be
some kind of response to the pure evil
of the January 6 convictions so if
if conservatives push back with every
single tool they have I think this would
be the place to do it you know I'm not
I'm not universally in favor
of you know whatever they did to you do
it back to them I I'm not in favor of
that I'm in favor of usually taking The
High Ground and trying to win you know P
persuading people that you're the good
guys is seems like a better long-term
play but in this specific case
the level of evil in this January 6
conviction stuff that needs to be
addressed with a
hammer this is not one of those where
you want to Nuance it you know you you
take a sledgehammer to this one so yeah
first do first go after them criminally
uh whether or not that works you also go
after them civil I would say that that's
probably the right play typically I
don't like this stuff
because it's it feels
Revy but this is Revenge with
utility so I'm I'm responding to the
utility of it at some point
conservatives have to say if you do
stuff like that it might take us a year
it might take us two years it might take
us three years it may might take us four
years but you're
I think that's important you need guard
rails in this world so you got to tell
them it doesn't matter how long it takes
you're going to eat this because it was
evil if if they had a good argument you
know I'd feel completely differently but
January six convictions were Pure Evil
and there were a lot of them and it was
sketchy behavior in every possible
way so yeah uh sledgehammer
meanwhile um president Trump said he
wants to eliminate estate tax calling it
unfair to hardworking
Americans um I want to give you a sense
of the estate tax if you weren't aware
of this if you of course there's like a
close to $14 million
exemption so if your State's under 14
million you get away with estate tax for
the most
part but if you had a business business
or a farm there's a pretty good chance
that the business or the farm would be
worth more than that and then once you
once you cross that number everything
above that gets a
40% um estate tax so the government just
takes 40% after that now if you have a
sep a retirement plan the SE requires
that if you were to take money out of it
after you retire if you took money out
of it you would pay regular income tax
which is fair because it was tax exempt
when it went in so you're just all
you're doing is paying the taxes that
you know were owed plus some extra if
you made money so I understand that part
and and certainly I understood that when
I went into it and funded my
sep what I wasn't counting on is that is
that if you have a business as I do you
know the dilber business is a business
um that you would after you paid 50%
income
tax you would also pay 40% estate tax on
whatever was
left so you'd pay
50% half of it just gone and then the
half that's left 40% of it also gets
taken away so what does that come out to
80
85% when you do the math
tax now I didn't know that when I funded
it it's something I started you know I
don't know 25 years ago or whatever and
you
know I just did it because everybody
does it you know you're supposed to have
a retirement account it's good for
saving on taxes I knew when I took it
out but basically the government is just
going to confiscate it they're just
going to confiscate it
now imagine if you owned a farm and the
farm has been in your family the whole
time but you've got several
beneficiaries well what do you do then
you're going to have to sell the farm to
pay the taxes and then split up whatever
is left to the beneficiaries but you're
out of business your Farm's out of
business
and so I'm very much in favor of getting
rid of this estate tax for selfish
reasons
but also because it's a it's a it's
basically theft I mean to me I pay a lot
of taxes and paying taxes doesn't feel
like theft I know I know what you're
saying you're you're saying all taxes
are theft but if my money is going you
know some percentage of it that I knew
they were going to take and it's higher
than other people's taxes because my
income is good that year or something
I'm not going to complain too much about
that I don't like it I'd like it to be
lower but the state tax is just
confiscation I mean
that's that's really dirty stuff anyway
I know you don't feel sorry for me
that's
okay Elon mus said in a post that the
Legacy Media is a Non-Stop
scop
um that is true but I would add the
following it's not a Non-Stop SC up by
accident it's a non-stops up by Design
and this is one of the hardest things to
accept as true in your world the news is
not meant to inform you it's meant to
control you the news is and always has
been and always will be manipulated by
the intelligence service to keep America
strong and make sure that the country is
United and does what the government
wants it to
do so there's no real alternative to the
news being a SC up there really isn't
because I don't think you could hold the
country together if you had actual free
speech and free you know free news so
the best you can
do is you know have something like the
xplatform and Rumble where you can get
something closer to the truth if you
want it but the news is designed as a
scup it's not designed as uh a public
service which morphed into something bad
no it's it was always a s up by
Design all right so I continue to be
entertained by democrats trying to
figure out what went wrong the closest
one is Van Jones so I talk about him a
lot Eric abinante was talking about uh
on on X today a uh post where Van Jones
was explaining to some Democrats what
went wrong and basically had to how to
adjust so here's what uh van said he
said
uh um he identified what he called the
high IQ low EQ trap so by his telling
the Democrats are the high IQ group but
their emotional intelligence wasn't good
because they showed their arrogance and
disrespect and
condescension that the that people can
see from a thousand yards away says F
now so
far is he
right well he's definitely right that
Democrats showed their disrespect and
condescension and that almost certainly
changed votes I think I think he's right
on topic on that I don't think it's the
key problem I I think people not being
able to buy gas and you know people
coming over the Border was probably
bigger but yes it definitely made a
difference that one side was saying that
you suck and the other side was saying
you know what about these
policies well you suck I know but what
about policies so he's
correct that the Democrats need to do
less disrespect and
condescension but is he correct that
they're the high IQ
people they're not the high IQ
people again this is
disrespectful and condescending van
Jones when I hear your comments I say
are you teaching them not to be
condescending or are you being
condescending and teaching them how to
be more condescending because if you
tell me that the Democrats were the high
IQ group
sorry let me make this adjustment for
you the Democrats are probably the high
College educated group are you with me
so far I would agree that they're the
more educated
party but didn't we watch them get just
about everything wrong for four years or
10
years so why is it that the smart party
got everything wrong they fell for every
hoax they fell for every hoax every hoax
the Smart Ones the Smart Ones fell for
every hoax I don't think you saw one
Democrat saying you know this whole fine
people thing was crap well I guess Bill
more So eventually
some but the thing that the uh
Republicans have going for them is a
much clearer idea of what's Happening
not always right plenty of plenty of
dumb people in the world so they're
going to be in both parties of course
and you're going to see them more than
others cuz it's fun to see the the dumb
people in both parties
but I really think you need to back off
the high IQ thing because if you're
talking about
leadership Trump has assembled the
smartest
advisers and team of leaders we've ever
had maybe since
1776 you know I'll I'll give you that
you know Jefferson and Adams and why
Washington might be pretty smart but
since then we've never seen a group this
smart and that's also why they're able
to work together why can RFK Jr work
with the the opposite party well part of
it is because he's
smart being smart gives you lots of
powers like flexibility ability to make
hard things work for you
right so far in a way far in a way
the current Trump Administration has the
smartest leaders and advisers we've ever
seen I mean they impress almost every
day and and the Democrats had the worst
and literally brain damaged that they
had you know Biden's brain didn't work
and they replace him with kamla Harris
whose brain doesn't
work and they're the high IQ
party the high IQ party couldn't tell
the Biden was mentally
diminished they couldn't tell how many
Republicans couldn't tell none every
single Republican said um I'm listening
to you in 2019 and you don't sound so
good I'm not sure you're going to make
four years all of them pretty much every
Republican saw it how many Republicans
knew that KL Harris was not bright
enough to be the good candidate for all
of them every one of them mean while
what were Democrats thinking was
happening they thought that Russia was
colluding they thought the that the
president was a
Neo-Nazi you know we don't even get me
started on you know the
pandemic they got everything wrong
they're transing people children
everything if if you look at the you
know if you measure the IQ of the
Democrats I do I do believe because a
lot of them are in the higher education
group they'd probably pass an SAT or a
GMAT they probably do really well but
when it came to the real world where
they had to make decisions about what's
real and what's not they got everything
wrong climate change the the way the
left understands climate change is just
a joke it's just a joke they have no
idea that that multi-year predictions
with many variables aren't real that's
not real you can't predict the future
that way nobody
can and I think the Republicans all know
it that the that the models are
ridiculous and the Democrats
don't the Smart Ones
right anyway
um but I'll but I'll say again you know
even though I'm criticizing you know van
Jones's take on this he's still the
closest I think he and uh you know James
Carville and probably Bill
Mah I think they're they're circling it
but they're not they're not quite there
yet they're they're on the outside of
the you know they're knocking on the
door but they're definitely not inside
they don't know what's going on yet but
they're very close getting
there
um so the other thing the Democrats keep
complaining about is that the that Trump
has billionaire billionaire helping him
they're talking about Elon Musk so
here's the current number uh according
to Maria noal was reporting that Forbes
was saying this that uh Comm Harris was
backed by 83
billionaires Trump had
52 so even so even the billionaire
backing was way more for the Democrats
now on top of that what about George
Soros and Bill Gates and Reed Hoffman I
mean the the democat have been just
living off this billionaire backing
forever but both parties have so the
billionaire thing is
ridiculous
um yeah as Mark andreon said uh that
elon's enemies have a real
problem um their argument that a man
worth 400 billion is doing it to make
more money is obviously not credible so
Elon mus responded to that on X he said
also if I'm allegedly quote bought by
some country or group how can they
realistically afford it I'm too
[Music]
expensive how could they afford it of it
too
expensive yes that that is exactly
correct how could you possibly afford
it well like what would that even look
like all right we we Russians we have an
offer for you Elon Musk if you will sell
on America we will give you $10 million
$10
million that's nothing all right we'll
give you I mean it sounds like Dr Evil
doesn't it we'll give
you1 billion
dollar really that's all one
billion hold on hold on um hold on I
just made a billion well we give you two
billion dollar hold on hold
on 2 billion I'm at I just made another
billion you can't really buy a guy like
that it'd be kind of
hard but I should point out before you
get all high IQ about it the one of the
things that conservatives say at least
on social media every day is that Bill
Gates is in it for the
money how many of you believe that Elon
Musk is definitely not in it for the
money he's not in my opinion he's not in
it for the money but you think that Bill
Gates
is do you feel that that would be a
consistent
opinion that Bill Gates is in Fr the
money but Elon couldn't be because how
could you bribe somebody that
rich I don't think either of them are in
it for the money exactly I think they're
in it for whatever reasons you know
usually good all right so I'm not I'm
not defending Bill Gates that's not my
job job I'm just saying that money's
probably not the main thing probably
not all
right um I've been waiting to find out
and some of you have as well what Elon
thinks about the Drone sightings and all
the uaps and
UFOs and I saw him post a meme that
suggests he thinks it's all
fake he didn't say it but the meme was
showing a bunch of aircraft
Silhouettes and they were all labeled
drones you know so to help you spot
drones so the joke was that it's just
regular airplanes that people are saying
I've never seen anything like that it
must be a Alien Drone or China or
something so since uh that was just a
meme I don't know if uh musk has more of
a Nuance take on it but it doesn't look
like he believes we have any trouble or
that there's anything
unusual
um and I don't know either
so I'm I'm genuinely
puzzled because it looks for all the
world like a mass hissteria to me it
looks like a mass hysteria but I can't
explain why so many capable smart
incredible people are saying I'm looking
at it right now and I've never seen
anything like that
like that part I don't understand like
because there's no airplane that's
hovering over your house at 500 feet
right and there are very credible people
who say there's this car-sized thing
hovering over my
house and I can see it clearly I can't
get a good picture but you know you can
never get a good picture of anything
interesting um
so I'm open to being surprised about
whatever the real answer is my my
current best hypothesis is that it's a
combination of things but none of them
are aliens that's my best guess it's
just a combination of things some of it
fake sighting some of it mistaken some
Mass hysteria some actual maybe
somebody's testing some technology so
they don't want to make a big deal about
it could be some foreign influence some
foreigners looking at our army base it
could be all of that but probably not
one big thing I'm guessing it's a number
of things but I'm ruling out aliens so
far I might rule them in
later but on the all-in Pod fredberg
who's whose name interestingly I don't
know his first name from the all-in Pod
what is Fred BG's first name because on
the all-in Pod they call him by his last
name I think they
call some of them by their last name
um anyway whatever his first name is
fredberg um he thinks uh it might be a
SC up scop by China to crush America's
drone economy and the thinking goes like
this China has an advantage in drones
because they have fewer regulations so
they can design and build things and
prototype faster than the weekend and
they control most of the manufacturing
of drones now if they were to be clever
they would take a bunch of suspicious
drones fly them around in our busiest
airspace around New Jersey until we were
all freaked out and said we must have
regulations that no drones can fly in
residential
areas and then then we would over
regulate ourselves and then China would
go wild and own the world with
drones uh I I like I like the addition
of that
to the possibilities I don't think
that's the highest
possibility um to me it feels a little
too
clever but maybe I mean I can't rule it
out
maybe anyway
um so we've learned about Biden's uh
brain not working for his entire term
and you may have heard that uh
Insurrection Barbie is talking about
this on acts that uh Biden only had nine
cab cabinet meetings in four years but
here's the part so you already heard
that he didn't meet with his cabin
cabinet often but here's the uh the more
disturbing
part the the members of the cabinet had
to submit written questions in
advance uh and it's being written so
that he could uh have the answers
written down for him now I don't think
he's the one who wrote down the answers
I think his staff
and advisers wrote him answers so Not
only was he incapable of having these
meetings but he was incapable of
handling them like a meeting he just
used it to read something that was given
to
him that's really really bad how however
bad you thought things were it might
have been a lot worse sounds like it
meanwhile Ukraine's um established a new
point in history by doing an all robot
attack on the Russian lines an all robot
attack apparently that
included remote um controlled
surveillance and U Mine laying
drones so some of the drones were
surveillance some of them were laying
mines it included one-way explosive
robots now it doesn't expl it doesn't
explain what the robots look like I'm
guessing their dog form the four-legged
kind because I don't think you'd build a
two-legged robot if it's just going to
run ahead and
explode um so probably four-legged so
they sent these robots explody robots at
the Russians and they also had gun armed
bots so they had robots I think these I
assume these are remote controlled um
that had
guns and they sent no humans they sent
only robots and drones and they took
out um and they took out uh the the
Russians in very small area now as as
the article I read uh described it the
the robots are not good for holding
territory they're good for killing
people but you you'd have to move in
humans to hold the territory so we don't
know if the ukrainians even tried to
hold the territory but it does
suggest it does suggest that uh it's
going to be all robots from now on
now I think that's a really good thing
for negotiating because apparently there
are way more Russian soldiers than there
are ukrainians because they're running
out of
people if the ukrainians could show the
ability to double their strength through
robots and actually have them offensive
robots um I think that would make Russia
Russia ask a lot of questions CU I don't
think
Russia can maybe match them with
robots yet I don't think that China
would provide them with
robots so how would Russia ever match an
all robot
army they could afford
it but could they build it does Russia
have the ability to manufacture robots
they can make drones
or they can buy them from Russia but I
don't think they would buy four-legged
exploding robots or or machine gun
robots so there's some
possibility that we're on the verge of
completely
changing um yeah of completely changing
how war is done so that the the robot
army will beat the human Army basically
every time and you just need more robots
to win
so if Trump comes in he says here's the
deal Putin I'm going to keep funding
Ukraine which he already said that's
part of his negotiation but I'm going to
massively Supply them with Killer Robots
so you have you have a human Advantage
right now but I'm going to take that
away from you with robots I'll just have
the robots kill your people until you
don't have any left because you can't
match us with robots now of course Putin
does have plays as well he could say I
have Hypersonic missiles and I could aim
them at the United States to which point
Trump would say and you'd all be dead
because they would be because the United
States would destroy everything it could
destroy in Russia certainly Putin would
be
dead so nobody wants to do that so
timing is really good for negotiation
reasons uh it's always good to have an
unknown
that you could take with you to
negotiate because when you when you hear
that there was this one successful
little attack the first thing you should
ask is is that
 I wasn't there I didn't see it
do you trust the ukrainians to say that
they had an all robot attack and it was
a big success no you shouldn't trust
anything coming from a war zone not
anything but do the Russians
know because if you say to them uh we're
already destroying you with our robot
army you know the Prototype already
worked now we're going to just flood the
Zone with Killer Robots and you guys
basically are all
dead now if Russia doesn't know if
that's true and how could they I mean
even we don't know if it's true because
even if you tried hard to do it well I
don't know could you do it could you
build enough robots fast enough that it
changes the course of the war I don't
know know have no idea but here's the
the fun part Russia definitely doesn't
know they don't know if he can do it so
Trump can come in with the threat of
moving to an all robot army that will
destroy all of his his entire Army and
and Putin won't know for
sure if that's
real that's pretty strong that's a
strong way to go into the negotiations
because you could threaten it quite
credibly now that they've tested it and
it worked allegedly according to their
reporting well here's an interesting one
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah kamini
Kam claimed that that they don't have
any proxy forces in the Middle East and
if they want to attack anyone they'll do
it
themselves okay now you all follow the
news enough to know the Hezbollah are
proxies and Hamas are proxies and they
got proxies in Syria and you know
they're they're big on
proxies oh and they proxies in
Yemen right and and why do you know that
why do we all know that because of the
news we already done the
news the news that's a s
up so the news that isn't even trying to
be real the scop
news yeah it it told you that Iran has
proxies I'm just going to put this out
there what if they
don't what if they
don't now your first impression was the
same as my first impression that it's
such a bald-faced
lie it's so obviously not true because
every every news entity every news
entity reports that they have proxies
and Israel's entire existence is based
on the understanding that these are
Iranian proxies so how in the
world could they say this with a
straight face that we don't have any
proxies well maybe maybe they're doing
like the word thing where they say
they're not our proxies they're just
people we support with our money and our
weapons what they do is up to them you
so maybe they're weaseling it
somehow but here's the thing that
stopped me in my
tracks I still think they have proxies
so I I think we are correct you know
hasah Hamas Etc I think they have
proxies but I had to I had to stop and
pause for a second and ask myself is it
possible given all the other things that
the news has told us over the years that
turned out not to be
true a lot of stuff that turned out not
to be true like even our our reason for
the war in Iraq like really basic major
war things that we've been told were
true that just
weren't and and it made me stop and
think what if Iran doesn't have any
proxies we do live in a world where as
shocking as that would be and and I
don't believe it's true by the way I do
I do believe they have proxies but we do
live in a world where if I found out I
had been wrong about that
for
decades it wouldn't be that much of a
surprise because pretty much all the war
news is
fake so could that be fake and the
answer is it could
be now if you liveed there and you lived
in Israel and you had you know much
closer on the ground direct observations
of things you know I'm sure they they
know for sure that they have proxies and
is real but you and I don't have access
to anything except what people told us
so are you going to believe
Israel if Israel says Hey we've got this
problem it sure would help if you gave
us a ton of money to solve
it I wouldn't believe any country told
told me that but I do think there are
proxies my only point is that we live in
a world where something something as
basic an
understanding as that could turn out to
be wrong
and you you just have to stop and say
all right I'm pretty sure this isn't
real but can I be
sure hard to
say well here's something interesting
this this snuck up on me so Tata
chemicals in North America they've got
this soda ash subsidiary and I guess
soda ash is something you mine and it's
not based on soda uh it's just what they
call it
and apparently it's super
energy um energy intensive and so
they're going to build uh eight small
micro reactors nuclear powerered micro
reactors that I think is just for their
own
operation so eight
separate nuclear reactors tiny
ones just for one company and I said to
myself um when did that become
possible like I follow this topic I
didn't know anybody could just buy this
 off the shelf from an American
company is this going to work is there
already a a demo model where this works
and then I read so I have questions
about this one and then I read that it's
uh gas
cooled
right uh it's a gas cooled micro reactor
now the the traditional reactors that we
have in this country even the newest
ones the third generation ones um those
are still water cooled so if you lose if
you lose your power you lose your water
cooling if you lose the backup power as
well that's what happened with uh fuk
fukushi that's what happened in Japan
with their with their nuclear plant it
it wasn't it's not deadly to lose power
it's deadly to lose power and also your
backup power that's what happened to
them uh and the reason is if you can't
uh you know keep the water cooling the
thing it overheats Etc but what about
these gas cooled ones is it the same
problem that if you lose power it bounce
down or are these the fourth generation
where it's designed so it can't you may
maybe it just can't so I have lots of
questions this company uh
bwxt is the maker of these little micro
reactors and if this is
real this is a really big deal because
micr nuclear reactors is in my opinion
almost certainly the future of of US
Energy with solar of
course well there's a uh skinny spy
drone that can fly for a whole year
within a break so it just stays in the
air uses solar to recharge and it's so
light and skinny that it doesn't take
much energy to stay up there and it's uh
this is according to IFL science an
article there um so it is so good it
could be a cheaper alternative to
satellites so instead of uh putting a
satellite up there which is super
expensive you could just send your drone
up and it just stays there all
year um maybe I I assume it can stay
there forever because if it can stay
there for a year why wouldn't it stay
there forever until it wears out I
guess anyway and uh here's some
interesting news so the Vigilant Fox um
has been reporting on this and Joe Rogan
was reporting on the Vigilant Fox's um
reporting and there's a I don't know if
I mentioned this before there's a
existing drug that is being repurposed
for cancer but they don't know if it
works yet called Fen
bendol Fen bendol so Fen bendol is sort
of like ivin and that they're both in
that existing existing um drug it's
already approved for um I think worms or
something so it's sort of like ivin same
same
domain but also low side effects like
icton so there's something that has low
side
effects and
um apparently there's according to uh Dr
mackus there are like 12 different
mechanisms for stopping cancer in this
one drug
now as I've told you before the odds of
something that works in the laboratory
and works in animals also working in
humans not so good it's about
5% that work in animals and then it
successfully becomes a product in humans
um but at least some of the
reason that things don't become legal
for humans is that they would have side
effects and the side effects might be
worse than the thing they're treating
however when you're talking about I Mech
or
hydroxychloroquine or Fen bendol you're
talking about things where we already
know that the side effects are
minimal so if you've crossed the no side
effects that are going to stop it
um then it's not 5% I would guess that
it would be bigger by the percentage of
things that typically were ruled out
just because they had bad side effects
so I don't know what the odds
are but the reason there are no big
clinical trials is that there's not
enough money in it because it's an
existing drug doesn't cost much to make
it and if it worked it would be
amazing um
so the question will
be does it
work and how would you ever know if
there's never a
trial well one way you can know is by
talking to people who tried it but
that's not going to work most of the
time because people who get cancer
diagnosis will try everything that's
even mentioned so if their doctor says
do chemo do re
do do hormones they'll probably do all
of those things or at least two of the
three and then if they also take this
drug then it won't be so clear you know
what's making a difference so it' be
unusual for somebody to just take this
and then see what
happens right so there's not enough
money to test
it but there's also no not even the
anecdotal works because nobody will do a
clean anecdotal they'll always do
everything you could possibly do because
you know you're a little
desperate
um but I will tell you that I have
personally
communicated with somebody who uh had a
one of the bad cancers I won't be more
specific than that and claims to me in
person by by message but a personal
message that uh the cancer is cleared
and it's an incurable one it's one of
the incurable ones now it's one
person but what's special is that this
one person did not do chemo radiation or
any any of the normal stuff and his
doctors tell him he's
cleared so that's an incurable cancer is
one of the incurable ones that nobody's
cured of when I say incurable I mean
nobody but there is a real human being
who has told me
personally that he also I think he may
have also taken Ivor meon but uh he's on
this Dr matus
program
and it's one
person but here's what I don't trust if
a big Pharma company does a trial and
they say you'll live 30%
longer um if you take their drugs and
your chemo and stuff I don't trust the
30%
because I just feel like it's too easy
to manipulate numbers you know
30% but if there's even one person that
you could be sure and I can't be sure in
this case by the way because it's not
somebody you know like you'd have to
live in their house to be sure you know
I'd have to stand next to them and you
know watch them put the pill in their
mouth to be sure but somebody you sounds
honest to me doesn't have any you know
Financial incentive that I can tell
um and one person says that according to
their doctors he's
cleared now one cure of an uncurable
thing gets my interest now that is far
far from proof you all know that right
it's far far from proof um you need real
science to get to
proof but uh it's enough to ask if
there's any
others so if it turned out there were
two or three other people
and their their doctors also confirmed
that they were
cleared I'd be quite excited about that
quite excited so I think you're going to
hear well I know you'll hear you're
going to hear more about this um and
you'll probably figure out sooner or
later whether it works or not and uh
I'll keep you informed keep your eye on
this one I just have a feeling about it
all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I've for now we're going to enter
our incredible incredible Sunday it's
going to be the best thing
ever
um uh it's called
remission well uh I understand what
remission is and I know that you have to
watch him for five years or something
but we're talking about a specific
cancer that basically doesn't go into
remission so at least nobody's ever
heard of
it nobody's ever heard of it doing that
so but maybe it has um but I would agree
with you we are nowhere near proof so
don't take any don't take any medical
recommendations from me but it does have
that pattern recognition thing where it
makes you think of Ivor mechon and other
things and so who knows who knows maybe
we get lucky all right I'm going to talk
to the locals people privately for just
a moment the rest of you thanks for
