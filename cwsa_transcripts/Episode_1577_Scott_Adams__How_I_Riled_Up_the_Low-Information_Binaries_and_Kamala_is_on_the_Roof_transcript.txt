bam
wow
wow
what a morning and it's just gonna get
better
holy cow
um
i think this is going to be the best
time you've ever had in your life
and maybe the best time anybody's ever
had in any life ever
we're including past lives
and uh if you'd like to take it up a
level and i know you do because that's
the kind of people you are do you settle
for the best day ever no
that's not good enough let's take it up
take it up a level all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker tells us
not in a canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen now
watch this watch it
savor it
savor it
good
good job on the simultaneous sip those
of you who only watched
well some people like to watch
some people like to get right in there
you know what i mean you know what i
mean some people just want to
sit in the corner and watch
but that's okay that's okay i'm not
judging
i'm not judging
yes the people who do the simultaneous
sip are better than all the other people
no i did say that i'm just kidding
well um
you should know if you're not on the
locals subscription platform following
me
that uh i'm almost at my 200th micro
lesson
these are these little two to four
minute lessons where i teach you a a
life a skill
that you can actually use forever
and we've got over about 200 of them the
one i did yesterday was a micro lesson
on persuasion voice
so how to how to control your voice for
maximum persuasion
so that's on
locals
uh last night my house got vandalized
yes my house got vandalized
now
i don't know who vandalizes a house
that's bristling with
with video cameras
but
but it's probably going to turn out to
be a bad play because i expect that
10 minutes after i get off this call
i'm going to have a license plate and an
identification
let me just caution anybody who wants to
screw with my neighborhood
my neighborhood is pretty we're pretty
prepared
[Laughter]
so yeah you you can cause some damage to
my house
and we don't know exactly if i was
targeted or somebody else in the house
was
was the target of it
but it's going to cost me some money to
fix it
it'll cost me some money
and
i will know who did it probably in an
hour
all right so if if you happen to be
watching or know somebody
who did that uh just know that i'm going
to be them up at about
some time before lunch just just know
i'm coming for you i'll have your
identification probably
probably either somebody already has
that they're just waiting to tell me
so anyway just thought i'd tell you that
i i don't know if there'll be more as it
gets closer to election time
i'm expecting a lot more attacks on me
personally aren't you
don't you expect that there should be a
major hit piece
developing on me somewhere by now
because i'm you know i have a little bit
too much influence so whoever thinks i'm
influencing in the wrong direction is
going to be probably looking for some
journalist to take me out
but good luck with
that good luck with that
all right
so the news is there are rumors coming
out of
washington and the white house and i
would say these are probably just rumors
that kalama harris looks so unelectable
that they're looking at
getting rid of her
but they might do it with a promotion
which would be the most deliberate way
to get rid of a vice president
what what is the most deliberate way to
get rid of a vice president
if you if you have to pick one thing if
you're familiar with the dilbert comic
yeah you pre
she might get promoted to the supreme
court
[Laughter]
so they could get rid of her
seriously
keep in mind that the supreme court
is in my opinion
the last credible institution which
doesn't mean i agree with them all the
time
but i think i think a lot of people
would have the same opinion the supreme
court is our last
credible institution even if you don't
like their decisions
you know at least they're credible
but if you put kamala harris on there
for what would look like an obvious
just getting rid of a reason
i'm not sure that makes the supreme
court more credible
i think that would make it less credible
uh
you know i'm not saying because of her
qualifications or because of her you
know leading left or any of that it's
just because if you think she was put
there to get rid of her
you're just going to have a whole
different idea about the supreme court
oh that's where you put the losers to
get rid of them
i mean that's not the case but it would
feel like that
i'm going to say that the supreme court
rumor is false
false they may have talked about it
but i'm going to predict that does not
happen anybody want to challenge that
prediction
kamala harris will not be named the
supreme court they might be talking
about it but i don't think they can i
don't think they can pull the trigger
because that would just be so
ugh
right
you wouldn't even know how to put words
on that would you you would just hear
that story and you'd go
like it can't even be described
it's so awful
anyway here's some more uh weirdness
uh jack pasadek was noting that uh
the lead prosecutor in the gelane
maxwell case
is uh james comey's daughter
now
have i told you that one of the tells
that we live in a simulation
is character reuse not just code reuse
but specifically characters
let me give you an example this from my
real life
i think i could tell this story
um
and i can't tell this story well suffice
to say a weird coincidence happened in
my personal life that
the same people
keep popping up in all kinds of
different contexts
so there's one person who popped up in
one context
who i knew from another context and it
was just a weird coincidence but
what are the odds that like a case of
this
magnitude
would have somebody from the known set
of characters on it
i think the answer is usually pretty
good
because in washington isn't every
high-end lawyer related to a politician
or married to one or you used to work
for one
yeah
i think in some places
um you would expect these kinds of
coincidence not really a big coincidence
because uh the everybody who goes into
law has some kind of connection to
somebody important it seems like anyway
i guess the
judge is not going to allow the case to
be televised and there's speculation
that they're protecting the
the elite pedophiles
i don't think that's why
if i had to guess
it would be this
now it could be just a general feeling
that they don't want to make a
you know a spectacle out of the case
that'd be a good enough reason for me
but the other reason might be that a lot
of names are going to come up associated
with galen maxwell and with epstein
and they're not all guilty
you know what i mean
i i do genuinely think that he
associated with people who were not
necessarily doing any crimes
they might have just run into him didn't
know what was going on you know
interacted with them longer than they
should have
bill gates for example might be one of
those
so i would think that a smart judge
would want to
close the proceedings just because lots
of names would come up
without a case against them
it's one thing if prosecutors are have a
case
but if names just come up as associates
or people they knew or people who
traveled with them
i feel that would be deeply unfair
in our system of justice what do you
think
don't you think it would be deeply
unfair to start hearing names of people
who just
were in the circle
trump jumps a good example right clinton
bill clinton i don't have any evidence
that they did anything wrong either one
of them nor do i have evidence that they
didn't
i don't have evidence one way or the
other but i don't think that unless
you're going to bring a case against
them i don't think we should be hearing
these names in some kind of
you know defamatory way
well let's talk about the omicron
virus which the world health
organization knows literally nothing
about
this is what they said on their tweet
this is the the who
we don't yet know whether it is
associated with more transmission well
that'd be pretty important to know
we don't know if it gives you
risk we don't know risks of reinfection
risk of evading the vaccines basically
we don't know anything about it
so you should be very very afraid about
the thing we don't know anything about
i guess
but they're working urgently
to answer those questions
now i ask this question because i'm an
optimist
not because it's likely
i'm just an optimist
i'm trying to think of any
way
that any virus would stop circulating
because
we've talked about this before for some
reason they just stop
now the
the old thinking was that things stopped
because you reached some kind of herd
immunity
but we know that that's not the case
like the spanish flu i don't think
reached herd immunity but it stopped
so
i had speculated and i'm getting closer
to
saying this is probably true that the
only way antivirus stops is that
it creates its own vaccination
meaning that a variant eventually comes
out
that affects people as well or better
than the original
but doesn't make them that sick and then
gives them some immunity against the bad
one
is there any scientific evidence for
that at all
is that
i can't tell if this is me just
spitballing or if there's any science
who's said something similar
well i know a dead host is useless yeah
but that's not exactly the
the answer here
okay well that's what i think is
happening and one possibility is that
this uh
that this is the one
the omicron might be the vaccination
it might be the end of the pandemic
it could you know the
but it's too early to say that
because the early reports of
mild symptoms are coming out of south
africa
now south south africa is part of a
continent
in which people are way younger way
thinner
way less likely to have any problems at
all
so i think that even the regular
covid
would have given them the same group of
people mild symptoms so i don't think we
know if omicron is worse or not too soon
to know
but we don't see evidence of people
having worse problems from it
so we don't know that it's better
but there's no evidence of it being
worse
so that's
not quite
you know that's not quite data
that's short of being data
but
i'm feeling like it's time
it just feels
it just feels like this is it
i'm not sure i felt like this before so
i i can't tell you that my
my feeling is based on anything that you
should believe
because it's just a feeling but i am
feeling that this omicron is going to be
a mild one
and that it will finish up our herd
immunity in its own weird way
i said this on twitter yesterday and i
got almost no pushback on it which is
the story itself
so here's something that i couldn't have
said
one year ago
like the public wasn't ready for this
you ready
so i've told you that there's some big
big shift
in public awareness that's happening
and i'm going to talk about that a
little bit more but the first thing i
noticed was this dog that stopped
barking
for about
i don't know five years
since i started doing
you know public stuff about politics for
most of those five years the biggest uh
criticism i got
was oh yeah we should listen to the
cartoonist
let's not just listen to the experts oh
we should pay attention to the
cartoonist sure cartoon boy tell tell us
what you're thinking
we'll just stop listening to the
scientists and the experts we'll just
listen to the cartoonist
that all stopped
it's all stopped
and i didn't notice it for a while
and it took me a little bit to figure
out why
now i could take
you know credit for maybe being more
credible
but i don't think that's what's
happening
i don't think that people's opinion of
my credibility has changed
you know because of my performance
i'd love to think that the world was
like that you know they could see me
doing a good job and then they could say
oh
that one's doing a good job predicting
so we'll give him a little more
credibility
no i don't think that happened here's
what i think happened
i think it was like trump beating
hillary clinton in 2016.
trump never made himself more popular
he simply made her less popular
successfully and remember i predicted
that i said trump doesn't need to become
more popular
he just has to make her less popular and
then he went out and did that he did
exactly that
so i think what happened is that the
experts have so
self-immolated
that almost anybody seems credible
relative to the experts now because the
experts have done such a bad job
at least it looks that way i would argue
that it isn't so bad
but the public impression of the experts
is awful right now
so suddenly
if you say well i heard it from an
expert versus i heard it from a
cartoonist
they don't sound that different anymore
do they
they should
i mean they should sound different but
the experts have done such a good job of
destroying their own credibility
that people just don't say that about me
anymore
so that's the first thing
so i did a little experiment on twitter
because i was very curious
about
many of my critics
who seemed to think i had completely
different opinions than the ones i
actually have
and they were quite
adamant in their criticisms of the
things i don't think can have never said
and i wondered where is that coming from
and is this something that happens to
everybody and i just see more of it
because i have more of a public profile
and so
i did a little experiment to find out
and i think i have the answer i didn't
think i would necessarily get one but i
do
so i want to give you uh
i'll tell you what happened so i tweeted
if you if you're one of my critics
tell me in one clear sentence
what you believe is true that you think
i don't you know just give me the one
thing we disagree on
what do you think happened
when i asked people to tell me
my critics the people were really really
mad at me to tell me what they disagree
with what do you think happened
almost none of them disagreed with me
yeah no it wasn't crickets because they
had to say something
but i'll give you some of the examples
of what now they imagined i i was saying
things that i didn't i'll tell you why
they imagined it there's a very specific
reason
the people who think they disagreed with
me and that i'm talking crazy
almost all were twitter followers
or people had seen me on twitter
but not the live stream
all right so the people who've seen my
live streams had a completely different
opinion of me but on twitter the biggest
complaint was that i don't seem to take
a side
i'm not taking a side and therefore or
that i see him on both sides of issues
is that fair
would you say that that observation is
true based on twitter anyway that i seem
to be on both sides of issues
that's how it works
every issue
has some positives on one side and some
negatives on one side so if you're not
on both sides of every issue
are you even thinking independently
you should at least be able to say oh
here's a good point on this side here's
a good point on the other side now on
twitter
i think i'm less likely to state a
direct opinion than i am here
i hadn't really thought about it but i
think that's true so the people on
twitter
i call the underinformed
the binaries are people who see two
teams
and they see you saying things that
would be good for one team
but wait now you're saying things that
would be good for the other team
so now scott you're being ambiguous
how can you say something good for one
team
and then also say something good about
the other team that doesn't make any
sense so scott you won't take a side so
therefore you're a weasel
that's what they say
is that what's happening
and some people say i'm betting both
sides
it's called fence sitting some people
say yeah
i would call it looking at all the
issues
i mean that's what it looks like to me
so the binaries are the people who
believe that everything fits into the
two buckets
and i never fit into the two buckets
so the binary choice is
don't take the vaccine vaccination
because it's dangerous
or take the vaccination because it's you
know good
and you know it's more good than bad
right those are the binaries
cassandra says you fell for several
hoaxes
but yet you won't be able to name any
watch this
cassandra name a hoax i fell for
i'll just wait for you
so on youtube
name a hoax that i fell for
if you mean the covington kids for
exactly 24 hours that would be true
the name
if we're talking about the virus
yeah there won't be anything right so
the covington kids was
yeah i was fooled by hoax for all of 24
hours
so i copped to that
you fell for the icl model no i didn't i
don't know what the that is
i'm sure i didn't fall for it
um
previously vaccinated poses a far
greater risk no the science is not
growing on that
you're you're reading crackbots
um
i'm not ruling it out but the science is
not growing on that i don't think that's
true
so here's what's happening i think the
people on twitter who don't uh see me
you know dealing with the whole issue
they just see me say things like
i'm not sure if the vaccines work
but i took them
because that doesn't fit into another
category right
i don't know if the vaccines are good or
bad
i only know that i decided to take them
nobody else has that opinion that i know
of or at least they don't say it in
public probably lots of people have it
or how about this
i think lockdowns work
and we totally shouldn't do them
right it doesn't fit into your box
people say either the lockdowns don't
work and we shouldn't do them
or they do work and we should do them
i say they do work
but we shouldn't do them
other
let me give you some of the other
comments that people
believe i think
this is things that people said about me
you think vaccines work
is that an accurate description of me
you think vaccines work
all i know is i took them and every
expert in every country says that they
work
that's what i know
do you disagree that that you know let's
say 99
do you disagree with the fact that 99
say that they do work
and that i took it that's all i know
and i know that there are other people
who are serious people mostly rogue
people but they have credentials and i
acknowledge that they say there could be
some big problem
all right so that's two uh nuance i
guess
um somebody says i i strategically avoid
stating my position
no i don't
no i don't
i just don't always do it on twitter
uh
you believe it's likely that the vax
compliance close to 100
will make the government remove
restrictions
and somebody says there's no chance that
yes i do believe that
and so do all of you
so do all of you
if
it'll never happen right we don't think
it can happen but imagine if if
california reached 100 vaccination
or 95 percent
they would lose their argument for
continuing to keep things locked down
especially as the therapeutics are
coming online
so um i believe that if uh vax
compliance was high
which i don't recommend
i'm not recommending you get them i'm
not recommending you do or don't get a
boosters so i'm not saying what you
should do that's that's the problem
i'm just saying predictably
if the government's reason for lockdowns
goes away
probably the lockdowns will
not right away but we could make it
happen
if you got kovid why would you not try
ivermectin i don't know
i don't know why do you do you think
that i disagree with you i would try it
so can i say that i think it's very
unlikely that ivermectin
is the solution to covet
and at the same time can i say but if i
got covet
i would take ivermectin right away
because i don't i don't fear the
consequences of it you know hurting me
so i i occupy all these weird middle
grounds where i can you know feel both
sides but
i don't think he didn't have it quite
right
somebody said they've successfully
inserted they being i know the deep
state or somebody have successfully
inserted the narrative of blaming the
wave of heart problems on covet and the
blue pills have taken it hook line and
sinker
and that i'm the canary in the coal mine
so the suggestion is that i'm part of
accepting the narrative
that the wave of heart problems are the
covid and not the vaccination itself
no
no
no that doesn't describe me at all
what i would say is we don't know
i'm saying that all data is unreliable
there is definitely alarming
stories about people dying
uh
usually those alarming stories turn out
to be fake
they're just coincidence or
misinterpretation
but
i'm not going to tell you that the
heart problems from the vaccination are
less or more than
the
the covert risk
i'm just saying that they both have a
risk
how in the world would i know which one
is bigger
how would i ever know that
all right
anyway i could do some more of this but
my favorite one is the abacus he's a
user who sent me a list of
tells for being a fascist
and says that you should look at how
many scott adams
applies to
so i'm going to read the list of how to
know you're a fascist
and i want you to vote in the comments
which of these apply to me
powerful and continuing nationalism yes
or no does that apply to me
uh
powerful and continuing
nationalism people are saying no
really
definitely yes
yes
yes if this is a tell for uh
being a fascist
absolutely i i have a powerful and
continuing
sense of nationalism
i'm not apologizing for that
i would call that patriotic
and i would hope that
people in other countries feel the same
about their country i hope so
because i'm sure some of their countries
are quite awesome
and they should feel quite proud about
it
all right how about this the second one
is disdain for human rights
do i do i display a disdain for human
rights
no
how about identification of
enemies as a unifying cause
that would be everybody
right
is there anybody who doesn't identify
the
the side that's causing them problems
there's nobody who doesn't do that so
yes
i absolutely do this so so far two out
of three
signs of fascism i i perfectly identify
with supremacy of the military
well
supremacy meaning the military runs the
country
i'm vehemently opposed to that
but i would like our military to be
supreme compared to other militaries
so this one's ambiguous but i certainly
don't want the military running our
country
rampant sexism
did you know that was part of fascism
i feel like this was just a
like a woke thing that got lit added to
the list
rampant sexism
what what's that got to do with fascism
uh
but do i display rampant sexism
rampant sexism would be the idea that
some uh
some genders are superior
yes i do
yes i do have rampant sexism i believe
that men cannot have babies for example
uh some of you disagree i know but i
believe that uh women are superior to
men in the
uh production of human life
you know men are pretty good at their
part
but when it comes to actually incubating
the baby and producing it
compared to men
women do that way way better
so i guess i am a rampant and sexist
because i do think women make babies
better than men
um how about controlled mass media well
i don't control the mass media so
not sure that applies
obsession with national security
who isn't
is there somebody here who doesn't think
national security would be
really high on the list
of things to be concerned about
i cop guilty to that
religion and government intertwined well
i'm not a believer
but i do
acknowledge that um
the united states has intertwined
christianity and government and got a
good result
i think
now i could criticize lots of elements
of that and have but
i wouldn't doubt the fact that religion
and government
formed a
not a not a perfect union but pretty
good
pretty good
corporate power protected yeah i want
corporate power protected
that's why we have laws
uh we have laws to protect everybody
including corporations
um and corporations of course are
created for the benefit of the people
it just helps the helps rich people more
but it doesn't hurt other people
mostly
labor power suppressed have i wanted to
suppress any labor power
uh
i'm pro-union
uh so i don't know about that
uh disdain for intellectuals and the
arts well okay
disdain for intellectuals and the arts
guilty guilty
uh obsession with crime and punishment
well obsession is just sort of a
you know
a trigger word
isn't everybody
uh very interested in crime and
punishment i mean it's part of the
texture of life
how about rampant nepotism and
corruption
yes i have hired relatives
i have in fact hired relatives now i
don't run the government so i think that
would matter uh corruption not so much
and then fraudulent elections
oh i don't think that's me you're
talking about
that might be the democrats
so anyway this list of what it means to
be fascism is completely ridiculous
but apparently apparently i do meet
quite a few of those things
unapologetically
all right
the waukesha narrative is getting
hilarious with cnn these are two things
that cnn has said
without being embarrassed apparently
on cnn they reported wakisha will hold a
moment of silence today this might have
been a tweet
or a headline i can't remember marking
one week since a car drove through a
city christmas parade killing six people
and injuring scores of others
now i am mad at that car
if it had had a driver
we'd probably want to know more about
that driver but cnn's reporting it was a
car
so now we have rogue cars driving
through parades and killing people and
that that's a trend i hope doesn't
include but no mention of a human
involved in the crime just a car
also on cnn
said that a new york
nypd hate crimes task force
is investing after police say an
asian-american woman was attacked with a
large rock
so it's worse than just the cars going
rogue
now the rocks are throwing themselves
it's dangerous to go outside you got
your covered you got your cars driving
themselves after you you got your rocks
that are just flying through the air on
their own
it's a dangerous world people it's a
dangerous world
so of course what's happening here is
the cnn if if anybody was white like
rittenhouse
they would be talking non-stop about
that white supremacist which is not
you know that would be fake news but
that's what they do and did
but as soon as it's not a white male
who's the alleged perpetrator
well it's just the car driving itself
and the rocks throwing themselves
because the last thing we're going to do
is blame anybody
who's not a white male
all right
um i believe that there is an awakening
happening and it looks like this so it's
a bunch of things that are happening
they're changing the consciousness of
the country
uh now i predicted this was happen after
trump
that we would just see reality
differently and specifically we saw that
the news is fake
but mostly only the right saw that
the left thought it was only the news on
the on the right that was fake
but the right i think is a little more
aware
that even the news from their own side
could be fake
they're more likely to believe the news
on the right but they know now it could
be made up because they've seen enough
examples
but the left
is just figuring that out
with the written house case in
particular and now with the waukesha
story
i'm hearing anecdotally so we don't have
a poll on this but anecdotally a lot of
hollywood people a lot of left-leaning
people
and people are sending me tweets you
know private communications showing that
their leftist friends have
gone over to the other side
and they don't say it in public
but a lot of left-leaning people are
just woke up
and said wait a minute is all of the
news fake
how long has this been going on
yeah all of the political news is fake
i don't know about the rest of it but
all of the political news is fake it has
been for a long time
so
uh the left is figuring that out here's
what else is going on to further wake
them up
the democrats are watching uh the far
left of their own party destroy their
chances of ever having political power
again
so certainly the moderate democrats are
saying wait a minute
why are we associating with
this crowd
they're batshit crazy
so they're seeing their own wing being
crazy while they always accuse the right
of having the crazy wing which it does
so both sides have crazy wings i would i
would say both are racist
you know if you go far enough to the
right you get racists
but most most of the right or not if you
go far enough to the left you get racist
but most of the democrats are not you
know
not leading hard in that direction
all right
hollywood has even turned on the
wokeness uh i mentioned a tv a series
i've been watching
called the sex lives of college girls i
know i know it sounds like
you know porn or something but think of
it as it's basically sex in the city
redone with uh college freshmen
so think of it that way so it's just the
sex and the city model
which is you know
four or five
uh females
you're working out their sex lives so
this is just a college setting now mindy
kaling
is one of the producers of this with one
other guy i guess
so mindy kaling
is behind it and that's important
because
it viciously mocks woke culture
and even one of the main characters
is apparently a trump supporter but they
don't say that
a female
trump supporter now i i'm the one saying
trump's supporter that the show doesn't
say that at all it just looks like a
republican
but the fact that hollywood is viciously
mocking the woke people in the show
that's different right
it's now it's now
it's a subject of ridicule so you've
seen bill maher turn against it the
wokeness
and now we see a pretty big property
with a woman who
you would imagine would be
in the woke crowd because she's in
hollywood person of color woman
you know every characteristic that would
make you think she'd be the wokest
person in hollywood
and she's
she's producing a show that mocks it
now it could be that that's not
necessarily her opinion she might just
be a good artist
who likes to put out content that's
provocative and may not you know match
your personal opinions that's a thing
but
just the fact that it's even on at all
it means something to me
now you also have to add in biden and
harris's approvals are in the toilet
and the buildback better things looking
bad so rasmussen had a poll
just came out
51 percent of likely u.s voters oppose
the buildback better bill
now 51
isn't you know landslide number
but it certainly tells you that there
are more than just republicans who don't
like this thing i mean that's clear
um
so so some of the the sheen of the you
know biden will do everything better
everything the democrats do is better
than trump that's that's all just
dissolved now
then you look at the fact that trump's
policies on a number of areas are just
clearly better
the the border
you don't think that a solid chunk of
democrats are saying
you know if i had to be honest
trump might have been a bastard
but the border was in better shape then
right you feel that they're they're
seeing it now a little bit
likewise with uh inflation likewise with
china
likewise with a lot of other things
although i would say biden
and the democrats are not terrible on
china they're not worse than the
republicans i think they both fell short
there
and then of course the written house
case opened a lot of eyes so guy benson
tweeted this he said that three
left-leaning friends have independently
texted me
about this vanishing national story
talking about waukesha
they understand what's happening in
other words they understand now
that the press is making stories
disappear if they don't support the
democrats or the narrative let's say
now they can see it
uh but they can't quite bring themselves
to flat out and say
it's f'ed up one wrote
uh
one wrote and then
two of them concede that they now better
understand conservatives complaints
about the media
here it comes
or as i like to say
it's happening
it's happening
there there is an awareness shift going
on that's now i think easy to identify
doesn't we don't know how far it'll go
we don't know if this is just a you know
a minor pushback and then things keep
going the way they were
but i've always told you that the
slippery slope
is uh not real or it's a better way to
say it i think i've said it poorly when
i say it's not real
that probably is just fighting words so
let me say it less provocatively
a better way to think of the celebrity
is slippery slope so instead of
debunking it let me upgrade it and get
you to a place you could agree i think
everything everything goes in the
direction it's going
until there's a reason for it to stop
right you all agree with that right
everything will keep going the way it's
going everything
until there's a reason for it to stop
could be a physical reason could be
psychological whatever
so the slippery slope doesn't add
anything
to the basic understanding that
everything goes the way it's going until
it stops
but
if you can't see what would stop
something
you you say it's a slippery slope
because you can't see the stop
but the stop
materializes when it's needed
and i think we're seeing it materialize
the woke stuff now i think
is so widely discredited
that you would have no risk at all of
mocking it in public
i don't know you could have done that as
much even a year ago
you can just say it's a whole
philosophy that's hurting people more
than helping and you can say that the
school systems are the systemic racists
and you'd like to help
so i feel like things have really really
shifted just in the last really six
months i think it's accelerated
so this is all anecdotal right unless
you have some kind of a scientific
reason to think that there's something
going on here you should be a little bit
cautious
um
oh it's pronounced walker shaw
waukesha
so i've been pronouncing it
wakasha
yeah remember when they called it
political correctness right
um
erica says i have lots of friends
confessing their
democrat hatred privately to me
yeah
so
yeah i think the uh the pendulum um
is a better model than the slippery
slope
the slippery slope is like
you know if you imagine the pendulum you
know that um
imagine the one that's got the several
balls that are suspended and you take
the one ball and you let it swing and it
hits the balls and the other one the
other end goes up the same amount and it
goes for a while um
that feels like a better model than the
slippery slope
meaning that things will go in one
direction and then they almost always
reverse
because people just get tired of things
heading in the same direction or there's
a
counter that that pops up
greg gutfeld's show has helped increase
the awareness level of the middle third
of the public well to the extent that
he's pulling in any independence yes
all right now how many of you see it
are you seeing this trend in awareness
are you seeing the complete destruction
of the credibility of the press
and the professional set
in ways that even the left can clearly
see now they can see that their own
media has duped them
now the other here's the other tell
it used to be when i called the find
people hoax a hoax on twitter it would
be just filled with people saying you
crazy thing i saw it with my own eyes
but of course they didn't they saw the
selective edit of it which reverses its
meaning
now it used to be that people
pushed back on that
now i don't know if they all understand
is fake
or if they know it could be so they're
they're not just not joining the fight
so i don't know if i've convinced him
it's fake
i've convinced everybody who looked at
the transcript
if you look at the transcript it's
obviously fake
but
uh
i think people have softened to at least
the idea
that pretty much everything said about
trump
was made up or hyperbole or
crazy talk
um
you know the the one thing that i think
is like always completely fair to say is
trump university
i think people sometimes
sometimes ask me how i defend trump
university
and i say
i don't
i don't
you
have any opinion of that you want
um
uh
i will answer this one text
um and
that's all
all right my dirt freaks out when your
let's go off
uh
the bird was the vandal
because somebody says gas prices are now
so high
is actually cheaper to buy cocaine and
run everywhere
i
i appreciate that
yeah you know here
i can't defend trump university but i'll
give you some context
i was in the licensing business for you
know many years with dilbert and i can
tell you that the person who licenses
their name or their character in my case
they don't look at all the operating
details of the company that does the
licensing you know you do a quick check
to make sure it's not a complete fraud
but let's say it was somebody you knew i
think he probably worked with somebody
new
and they said hey we'll do this thing
we'll put your name on it
trust us
so
you know if he trusted someone he
shouldn't have trusted you should
certainly hold that against him you know
put it in the whole picture
but
if you believe there's no evidence of
this that he knew exactly what was going
on and was okay with it
that's not evidence
um
yeah
and i'm definitely licensed to people i
wish i had not licensed to after the
fact
so you're saying my dilbert condoms were
not a licensed product
yeah i'd worry about those
do you know how many sales gurus call
their programs universities
well
yeah
um did we do kamal on the roof yes so
yes we're talking about
kamala going somewhere we talked about
that all right i don't have much else to
do
uh to talk about
how about this
with this comment you okay with the
normalization of pedophilia scott all
the capitalism couples why would you
even ask that question
why do you even ask that question
like what would even
provoke you to ask me if i'm okay with
horrible crimes
why why would you be curious about that
for the record i'm i'm generally against
all horrible crimes
um
oh i haven't watched the beatles get
back to special but it's on my list
if there's no supreme court how will
they get rid of kamala i don't know if
anyway
don't know of any way you could do it
you know i think the uh let me tell you
what i think the democrats fear the most
you ready for this
here's what they fear the most
biden has to step down early
kamala harris takes over
and because she got the top spot the way
she did
it makes her automatically the front
runner
for the nomination
can you imagine anything that would
scare
the democrats more than that because
that would be a gimme when
that that would basically be
the election's over i think i'm not even
sure it matters who she ran against i
think she would lose to everybody
um
oh the get back
uh show about the beatles is good
uh
you can't primary uh black woman
is that what you're saying
that's in the comments yes you can
um
all right i just looking at your
comments
yeah your head would explode
uh you depend uh you'd attend dilbert
university well you know i'm thinking of
creating a university
so i told you i have 200 micro lessons
now
so i'm thinking of packaging them
somehow as
you know i had this idea of
a university that you could
attend while you're on the toilet
so the lessons would all be two to four
minutes
so you could do it while you're in there
anyway you do one a day
you'll have 365
life lessons at the end of the year
maybe more
so i and
i jokingly called it
turd university
because you do it in the bathroom two
minutes a day
uh
are they appropriate for teens yes the
the micro lessons don't have any
profanity and they are all appropriate
for teens
uh although i am considering adding some
content that
uh
i don't know if it would be appropriate
for teams
teens they won't watch it anyway so i
wouldn't worry about it
i'm
so here's what i'm thinking about i'm
gonna turn off youtube because you guys
uh can't hear this topic
uh there's something i'm just gonna talk
to the local subscribers about
nothing personal it's just that there's
some things if they get into the total
public domain
they turn into something that they
shouldn't be which is actually the topic
of what i'm going to talk to but the lo
the locals people won't do that which is
what's good about the subscription
system so with all due respect
youtube people i will talk to you
tomorrow
and locals people hang on
