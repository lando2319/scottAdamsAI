hey everybody
come on in come on in still time
you can catch the best show of the whole
day
now i know i say that a lot but
i haven't been wrong yet have i no way
and how can you enjoy this even more
hard to believe right i know i know it's
a big claim
but you can it can be done it's
almost impossible but i have faith in
you
i know you can do it and all you need is
a copper mug or glass of tanker chelsea
stein a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
what do we need more than anything in
the world right now a little news about
trump um we've got some
ah now that's a perfect day
trump's in the headlines coffee is warm
you're all here that's what i call a
good start
all right well the biggest news
is there's an unconfirmed report which
are my favorite kind
that the wuhan lab was at one point
doing experiments
on humanized mice giving them
some kind of bat viruses to see if they
can do it
which they could allegedly
now the first thing you need to know
about any report
that comes out of the wuhan lab
don't believe anything about the lab if
if there's one category of news
that you should disbelieve automatically
it's a hundred percent of everything
that ever said
about the wuhan lab there's nothing to
believe about that story
now i'm not saying that they did or did
not
weaponize a virus or release it or
anything else
i'm just saying that there is no
credible reporting about the wuhan lab
oh there's a lot of reporting some of it
from our own
government but none of it you should
believe
none of it but here's the scariest part
the wuhan lab was working on humanized
mice
and i feel like they buried the lead
lead is spelled l-e-d-e
if you didn't know that one of those
little trivia things you could know
and uh that's that's a publishing
publishing talk bearing the lead anyway
i'm a little bit more worried about
these humanized mice
than i am about the virus oh sure a
virus can cause a pandemic and
bring the whole planet to its knees but
i don't think that's as dangerous
as humanized mice because my first
question is
how big are they and do they look more
like
mice or more like people
or is it sort of a hybrid sort of a big
mouse person and my second question is
how large can these humanized mice be
before it's creepy to use them for
experiments
yeah you can use a bug for an experiment
and a little mouse
but as soon as things get bigger
this doesn't feel fair to use them for
experiments anymore
so i would worry that some of these
humanized mice
get out of the wuhan laboratory possibly
start
mating once around side create an entire
civilization of humanized mice
possibly five to six feet tall
probably good at math they've got that
human part
and then it's it's planet of the apes
all over again
yeah planet of the apes
okay no there's humanized mice just
means they have some genetic
thing that makes them react like people
but it's way more fun isn't it
it's way more fun to think that there
are rap people walking around
that escaped from the wuhan lab
all right let's talk about dr fauci
people are loving to hate on dr fauci
and i feel like that's just become his
job now
i think fouchy's job is to be the bad
cop
doesn't doesn't it feel that way if you
are criticizing fauci for being more
let's say more extreme about the
likelihood of wearing masks for a longer
time or whatever
if that's how you're thinking of him
you probably want to modify that a
little bit
because it seems to me that fauci is
doing a good job
of being a bad cop the bad cop in this
example being the the one who tells you
the scarier version of the story to get
you to
at least wear your mask now
so it's sort of like a big ask so when
fauci
is seemingly more extreme about how long
you
wear masks maybe to 2022 he's saying
does anybody believe that
i mean in your in your own mind do you
believe
that we're going to wear masks that long
even after vaccinations
and i guess megan mccain went after him
on the view
for for saying that um
he couldn't answer the question of
whether
if you had your vaccinations let's say
you're a grandparent
could you hug your grandkids after
waiting for the vaccination to kick in
and apparently he couldn't directly
answer the question
he wanted to you know check the data and
stuff like that
now how big a story is that
that megan mccain on the view is going
after
fauci it's not
it's completely unimportant fauci i
think
is doing something useful even though
you hate it
and the something useful is he's the bad
cop he's giving you the extreme version
i don't know that that's a mistake
as long as you have other voices out
there you know some optimists and
some realists i feel like you need a bad
cop
i don't feel like that's a mistake i
don't
because you know how human psychology
works right
we're we're gonna our brains are gonna
triangulate on you know something
in between the extreme views so he's
creating an
i'll say extreme you could argue about
that characterization
but a more aggressive view about how
long we would have to wear masks and
be locked down et cetera i feel it's
useful
i do feel it's useful so i'm not going
to be his critic
and i also going to use the same
standard i said from day one to the
pandemic
all of our experts are gonna make a lot
of mistakes
because it's new stuff and no as awesome
as science is
eventually it makes a lot of mistakes in
the beginning that's just how the
process works
so anything that fauci has gotten wrong
i forgive him publicly
for do i think he's a patriot i think
he's doing what he can
and i i think we need a bad cop and i
don't mind that it's him
all right um raul davis
tweeted something that'll make you think
for a long time
all right i'm going to read the i'm
going to read the tweet
or the or the quote
and by the way you should follow raul
davis ceo branding this
i guess the label he's got on his
twitter account just do a search for him
he has
lots of good observations so he says
the strange thing about the simulation
you know the simulation we're all living
in
is that robots will realize they're
alive
at the same point humans realize they
aren't
just chew on that for a while i i don't
know how many different ways you can
interpret that
but i like them all i'll just say it
again
robots will realize they're alive at the
same time the humans realize they aren't
just live with that for a little while
i'm not even going to say anything about
it just live with it for a while
um it reminds me of something i said
recently
that uh having complete power
and having no power at all are the same
thing
again i'm not going to explain it once
you realize
that that's true you sort of realize
you're
at a different level of awareness but
you can't get there
because somebody else explained it to
you until you realize that having
complete power
and having no power at all are exactly
the same
you're going to be kind of locked where
you are all right
uh one of my favorite stories there are
a lot of fun stories today
the news and sometimes the news is fun
do you remember
uh let's say years ago when i was a kid
the news was nothing but bloodshed
it was just death death death bloodshed
and now that it's turned into this fake
news
they don't really need to tell you a lot
of ugly things that will make you turn
off the tv because you would just go
watch something else
if you got sad every time you watch tv
so they tried to make
the news more interesting and they have
succeeded so there was an
ap reporter uh at some press
conference with i guess the biden
administration uh was it the
uh secretary of state
doesn't matter anyway
they were talking about this russian
pipeline project
the whatever it's called nord stream ii
and the risk of this pipeline is that it
would bring
a russian national natural gas to europe
now that sounds like a good thing hey
everybody likes natural gas
uh don't we i guess not everybody
but the problem would be that it would
make europe dependent
on russia for a big part of their energy
even more than they already are and so
trump had
put the clamp on that and i guess
trump had caused a number of companies
that had been working on it to
withdraw so this biden appointee was
claiming a sort of claiming credit that
that biden had put some extra sanctions
on russia
and the ap reporter asked the question
this way
it's the way he asked the question
that's the fun part
because after four years of watching
trump get hammered by the press
where we realize that the press has
realized
that they the press can't survive
without controversy and once
once trump is he's not out of the
headlines but once he's
a minor part of the headlines they don't
know how to keep their jobs
right they're gonna have to start
accusing biden of something
they're gonna have to cause some make
some problems if there aren't any there
already
so this ap reporter says this about the
pipeline thing
um let me give you the exact quote
he said uh quote uh to the biden guy
uh what was he somebody tell me in the
comments
the the biden guy was he the secretary
of state
i'm not sure anyway he said the ap
reporter says you guys have only been in
office for a month
right are you telling me that in the
last
four weeks these 18 companies
all of a sudden decided to say quote oh
my god
we better not do we better not be doing
anything with this nord stream too
lee said he's a reporter i guess and he
goes quote
you guys are taking credit for stuff the
previous administration did
yes or no
don't you love this reporter i think
it's just the way he worded it
yeah anthony blinken thank you it was
anthony blinken
um i just
love the way the reporter worded this
question and i would have loved it you
know
no matter who he asked it of it's just a
well-worded question
because he's basically calling calling
the guy out for
in the in the most direct way it was
just lovely
in other news you might be aware that
there was
some pennsylvania related election
uh um court cases that got thrown out
and the supreme court uh declined to
hear the case
meaning that they would not be heard by
any additional court
now the the the cases were rejected for
technical reasons
about standing so nobody looked at the
details of the fraud claims
just the uh the general picture of
whether the court could look at the case
at all and they decided the supreme
court decided five
to four to not look at them but
that creates an interesting situation
doesn't it it's five to four
so does that tell us that there are
four people who have been nominated
and uh and got
put on the supreme court so they're
they're like serious people right
serious i mean to say what you will
about
our supreme court they're all smart
right they're all qualified they're all
oh somebody says it was 6'3
thank you for that correction it was 6 3
not
five four so there were three three
justices
who dissented judge thomas was one of
them and here's why he said
in his dissent he said an election free
from
strong evidence of systemic fraud
is not alone sufficient for election
confidence
so in less complicated language he's
saying
just because you haven't seen fraud that
is not proof that it doesn't exist
has anybody said that before
me right that's exactly what i say
almost every day since november
i've been saying to people you
understand
that the lack of evidence being shown to
you personally
is not proof that evidence doesn't exist
you know that right and then people act
like they don't know that
the news the fake news pretends
that not being able to find evidence is
proof of no evidence
when you haven't looked now if you had
looked
that would be a little stronger argument
right it's not an absolute
but if you had looked really hard in all
the right places and you didn't find it
well you still couldn't be positive it
didn't exist
but you could be pretty sure but we're
not there because we haven't looked in
all the places that could exist
so you've got somebody on the supreme
court
who says exactly what i said and you
could pretty much get kicked
off of social media for this opinion
couldn't you just think of this if you
worded this
just slightly differently the exact
opinion
of a sitting justice on the supreme
court
if you just reworded his opinion and put
it in your own words
could you get kicked off of social media
you could i believe you could for saying
exactly what he just said
just wording it poorly right that's all
it would take
because the implication is that there
might be fraud in the election
not that there probably is not that
they're
you know not that it has been detected
but there's an implication
that there could be and further
if i read between the lines of what
justice thomas says
that nobody looked so you can't make a
claim either way because nobody looked
that's dangerous isn't it he's right on
the edge
of losing his freedom of speech at least
in the limited way of being on social
media
actually i don't know if he's on social
media so it doesn't matter
um okay
so and then he went on justice thomas
said and here's
here's sort of the money shot here he
goes quote the decision to leave
election law
hidden beneath a shroud of doubt
meaning the public has some doubt about
the election
is baffling he wrote
by doing nothing we invite further
confusion and erosion of voter
confidence
our fellow citizens deserve better and
expect
more of us
boom that's
exactly right that is exactly right
now i don't know if this is a good
enough reason for the supreme court to
take the case
uh if the supreme court rejected it for
technical reasons
of not having standing etc i don't think
that's a wrong decision
so i'm not saying that justice thomas
has the right decision
but he has expressed exactly what at
least
something like half of the citizens of
this country are thinking
he perfectly expressed it so i
appreciate that about a minority opinion
you know that one of the one of the best
things the supreme court does
as a process is they let the people who
are on
the losing side if you will write your
full opinions
so you can see what their problem was
this is a real good service for the
country and i love
i love that justice thomas took this
position so good for him
in trump news apparently
the supreme court again uh always in the
news
has decided that the
this democrat d.a sai vance in new york
can get access to eight years of trump's
taxes
so it looks like that's going to happen
now we are told
that that does not mean that these taxes
will be public information
can can i take a take a moment that's
right we're told that if
the psy vance and the the d.a in new
york
gets access to all of tom trump's tax
records for eight years
that that won't become public
necessarily
[Laughter]
i fake laugh at that idea of course it
will become public
do you do you think there's anything
more likely to become public than this
i can't even think of anything more
likely to become public
and it's worse than that it won't even
be all of it
it will be like little little snapshots
and rumors and
and i i've got an unnamed source who has
a copy
and then one page will appear somewhere
and you wonder where the rest of it is
you don't have to wonder which way this
is going right yeah
leaked in three two one but here's the
question you must ask yourself
what's in those things now it's my
opinion
i completely agree with trump which is
this looks like a witch hunt it looks
like a political
you know vendetta it does not look like
the justice system doing what the
justice does it doesn't look like it
now is that because the reporting is bad
i don't know maybe you've seen different
reports that i have here's what
we know about it we know that the
the biggest part of the case i guess
there's some stormy daniels part of it
which seems irrelevant i can't believe
that the payments to stormy daniels and
the other woman
are really the subject of the new york
district attorney putting all the
resources on this case
because he paid some some women on the
side allegedly
definitely did do you think that's why
the district attorneys are after him for
that
payment to the girlfriend that he didn't
account for right
i don't think so and let's say that
let's say that the worst thing happened
because of whatever they're alleging
about that
what would that be just a fine or
something a small fine
so it's not that right the the bigger
part of the case
is that uh allegedly trump
inflated the value of his company
and or properties for
getting a loan but then he deflated them
for purposes of paying property taxes
sounds pretty bad doesn't it yeah if you
don't know much about taxes
and finance and accounting and somebody
told to you that he
he had two different values for his
property
one that he only shows to the tax people
and one that he only shows to the
property tax people
you know one for the income tax purpose
one for property tax
purposes so that's pretty bad right that
sounds pretty bad
except that's normal
that's normal it's being reported as a
crime
but the part they've reported now i
don't know if there's something else to
the story
but the part they're reporting that's
not a crime
that's actually routine
that's normal my house
has a value according to the town for
property tax
values that value that the town
thinks my house has is based on
information i've given them when it was
first built etc
do you think that if i had a choice
let's say there was something ambiguous
and it could go either way
like legitimately it could go either way
if you're analyzing it
what do you think i picked well of
course i pick all the assumptions
that are supportable like i'm not going
to do anything illegal
but you take these supportable
assumptions that work in your favor
and if you've got two sets of uh
situations one for property tax one for
getting a loan
i'm sorry i think i said before that
there was two reasons
one for income tax versus property tax i
should have said
one was for the bank to give them a loan
and the other purpose was for property
tax
but that's sort of normal stuff
let me tell you a story that taught me
a lot about doing your taxes years ago a
friend of mine told me the story he said
he was doing his own taxes and they were
kind of complicated and it was a
situation in which
the irs provided ambiguous instructions
and it seemed like there were two
legitimate ways you could calculate this
thing
one of them would make him pay more
taxes and another way would make him pay
less
and he didn't know which way to go and
he didn't want to get in trouble with
the irs so he called his friend who is
an expert in
finance and said i got this problem you
know it looks like both ways are
acceptable according to the instructions
but one i'll pay more
more and want to pay less which one
should i do what would the friend
who was an expert advise
in that situation to keep his friend
from
any trouble yeah so somebody who has
experience in these fields says quickly
in the comments
the one where you pay less every time
oh somebody says there are people here
who are saying pay more
now everybody who's saying pay more you
know pick the one where you pay the most
you're not experienced in the tax world
everybody who said pay less is either a
good guesser
or you have experience in this field you
don't go to jail
for following the irs's own instructions
that's it so i had the irs called him in
on this one point which is unlikely by
the way i don't know if you know this
but audits
are usually targeted so an audit is
usually
i'm looking at something specific i'm
not necessarily looking at everything
you've ever done
i'm just looking at this specific
question what are the odds that that one
thing
that he would be audited on pretty low
right any one thing you do the odds are
low
unless it's something that creates a
flag
such as a home office thing that can
cause a flag
so uh and then
what happens if the irs calls them in
they let's say there's a chance they do
an audit
they say no you know you should have
calculated this
other way does he go to jail no
no there's not even really any risk
because
he followed the irs's own directions
he just picked one of two
interpretations there's no risk there
now he might might have to pay a fine
if the irs says you know but really this
is the way it should have been
you're going to pay a little fine on
this one all right
the the size of the risk is minuscule
and you know the size whatever he would
be penalized lately is not going to
change
anybody's life right so generally
speaking it is normal and routine
to take different interpretations even
when it creates different values
one for the bank and one for property
tax
completely normal situation
is your news failing you
because i'll bet that's the first time
half of you even heard that
right wouldn't you say that's the first
time you've ever known
that the accusation about his taxes on
the surface
it's not illegal there must be something
below the surface
that i don't by the way if you if you
it's not illegal to have different
estimates for the values
it would be illegal if you did one of
them fraudulently
now trump is claiming accurately
that his taxes are done by high-end
accounting firms
so therefore the part that the
accounting firm was responsible for
is unlikely to be a trump problem
in other words if if his technique was
blessed by a big accounting firm
the irs is going to look at it and say
okay this is in the case
of trump trying to do something illegal
this is the accounting firm giving him
advice
which is different right they're not
going to treat that the same
the irs doesn't expect the business
owner to be a tax expert
so if a if a legitimate tax expert gives
you advice and it's all documented
you as the owner are not in a lot of
trouble you might have to pay a fine
right there's still a fine possibility
but you're not going to go to jail
because your accountants who are really
good accountants
made in an aggressive assumption you
just don't go to jail for that
so the other thing you need to know
is that just because the accountants
blessed
the technique that doesn't mean it's
okay
they've only blessed the technique they
haven't blessed
the assumptions that went into the
technique
that's not something the accounting firm
does the accounting firm has to trust
the company to give them the right
numbers
right because the the accounting firm
doesn't audit the company
and make sure that the number they gave
them for each of the values is correct
they just accept them it is the
company's
responsibility to give them the right
numbers so when trump says
hey this great accounting firm did all
my taxes
don't interpret that as therefore there
can't be a problem
that just means that they've blessed the
method
doesn't mean they've blessed the numbers
that went into the method
all right scott does not do his own
taxes
you are correct um
my taxes are so complicated
oh my god like you you can't even
believe how complicated my taxes are
all right um i i just
i i just well it's a different story
um so i would agree with trump's
characterization of this as a witch hunt
unless the news can give us
some indication of why they're looking
into him it looks like they're just
digging for something
just digging for something i don't know
what they're going to find there
we'll find out all right um
my favorite prediction that i'll remind
you of all the time is that
every day that biden is in office trump
will look better
the reason being obvious when trump's
personality is out of the news
all you have is you know his policies
and biden will have a tough time
improving on a lot of his policies one
of them for example is kids in cages
and hilariously the washington post
it's almost unbelievable that they have
the the
the balls to even do this the washington
post so after
however many years of blaming trump for
kids in cages
at the borders they
they write a story about uh biden's
going to have the same problem of course
because the immigration is increasing
and he'll run out of um he'll run out of
let's say
civilized appropriate places to keep all
the people
because there'll be too many people
compared to the civilized
appropriate places to keep them
temporarily
and so uh they've reactivated these
uh migrant facility for children as the
washington post calls it
it's a migrant facility for children and
they're these little uh
looks like these little temporary
buildings that have air conditioning and
walls
but there are lots of these little pods
lined up
largely windowless or they i don't know
maybe they have a little window or
something
but okay maybe they're not
cages but they're boxes
if you were if you were kept in a box
with no windows
maybe you can see them but i didn't see
any windows on them
versus a cage i don't know if you'd have
necessarily a preference
would you i mean how many kids get put
in one of these boxes
is it better i don't know
so here we have biden reproducing kids
in cages but maybe his kids in boxes who
knows
it's all bad right so i don't want to
make
light of this like nobody's making fun
of
people who are in bad situations
especially kids
but it is fun watching the media
try to spin this as migrant facilities
for children
because i'm going to call everything
that's a box
from now on a migrant facility for
children's
yep i got a package from amazon today
i took my my item and of its migrant
facility for children oh we call that a
box
you used to call it a box all right
uh how many of you are watching my
ongoing
uh conversation shall we call it online
with on twitter with the doctors is
anybody watching the fun
so um as you know if you watched
recently i've been questioning the
statistics
about regular seasonal flu deaths
and this has attracted a number of
professionals doctors and nurses
to storm into my twitter feed to
call me an idiot in various ways and to
point out how
little i know about the doctoring
business my
complete ignorance of science my
my ignoring of the experts and the data
they are quite quite worked up some of
them are very mad
and so i decided to make them the show
as i do and
you really should just check my twitter
feed and look for the
my responses to the various people who
have md or rm
behind their name and just look at the
conversation
you're going to be amazed and what
you're going to be amazed at
is how doctors don't know how to think
it's scary now do doctors know more
about
medicine than i do yes
yes yes doctors know more than medicine
about medicine than i do so
i don't need to be reminded of that
right a lot of people have felt they
needed to remind me of that but
i kind of knew that right but here are
here's some of the things that they're
that they're getting wrong
first of all the mind reading so some of
them are telling me
what i'm doing but i'm not
so they're saying oh you're quote
tweeting me
to attract all the trolls to come in
and and you're a bad person scott
because you're basically
it's a bad look scott it's a bad look
you're a bad person because you're just
bringing all your trolls in to attack me
no i'm not that's just bad mind reading
how do you know what my motivation is
because you guessed
is that how doctoring works you guess
what people are thinking
how about just asking me you can just
ask me why i do it
and i'll give you the reason because my
entire
content including the dilbert comic
through every comment i've ever made on
politics they're all in the same field
which is showing that the experts are
foolish yet
in dilbert i show that the management
experts are full of
i show that your management is full of
 your training program is full of
basically debunking experts who know
wait for it way more than i do
right that's what i do for 30 years
i've built a fortune and a national
reputation
making fun of experts who are clearly
not thinking well
now they obviously know more than i do
about their area of expertise
but they don't think well and it's
obvious
so mind reading is a is your first sign
that somebody's not
thinking well they could ask me why i'm
doing something
and maybe i would tell them the truth
and maybe i wouldn't i mean i would
tell the truth they wouldn't know but
if you're if you're publicly debating
with somebody
and then then assigning them an opinion
because you're
a mind reader and then criticizing the
opinion you assigned to them
purely through your imagination are you
a doctor
are you a person of science
well that's the most ridiculously
irrational thing you could ever do
now of course all communication requires
making assumptions about what other
people are thinking you can't turn
off your ability well your reflex i
guess
to make assumptions about what people
are thinking
but where you should do that is in
simple situations
somebody orders food you might say to
yourself
they're probably hungry i mean simple
situations you'll get those right most
of the time
if somebody's yelling at you you might
say hey that person might be angry
you'd probably be right but i'll tell
you where you're not
good at it the mind reading thing
anything complicated or novel
anything new anything you haven't run
across and they have never run across
me specifically arguing about
uh seasonal flu statistics
it's a brand new situation so how can
anybody know what i'm thinking
in this brand new situation right it's
dumb
it's dumb to think that they could guess
what i'm thinking
now the real reason that i tweet quote
it
is not so that my trolls can come in and
attack them
that would be a dumb reason why would i
even do that
but there's a doctor who diagnosed me as
having that motivation and i didn't even
understand that
motivation like i don't know because i'm
a bad person
i would do that just to cause them some
pain
why would i do that no the reason i do
it is that it's the show
i'm putting on a show i talk i talk
about
i've often talked about trump knowing
that he's in politics but he's also
putting on a show
and he was the only person who really
knew that well reagan i think knew it
but he knew it better than other people
knew it that the show was part of it
as a public figure with you know the
cartooning as well as what i talk about
in politics and stuff
i'm always putting on a show that's my
job so even if it's not you know you're
reading the comic
or doing or watching in the live stream
i'm always putting on the show
you if you're in my line of work
you're never really a civilian if the
public is watching you you're always
putting on the show
and so the show is showing you that
these experts
probably know not probably know a lot
more than i do about their topic
but they don't know how to think another
one of them and you'll see
used like a weird analogy to make a
point
these are doctors who don't know that
analogies don't work that way
they're not part of reason in the
traditional way that people think
an analogy is great for explaining a new
concept
they don't have any value for winning an
argument
because they're just different
situations
so somebody said oh yeah well if this
happened or that happened in this
completely different situation what
would you do and i say
well it's a different situation it
doesn't matter what i would do in that
different situation
it would be like saying well elon musk
is
uh putting people on mars but
what if you were mowing your lawn and
you hit a rock
to which i say that has nothing to do
with going to the moon
so unless your analogy is telling me
some point
it's not an argument it's just a
different situation
doctors apparently don't know this or at
least the ones who are arguing with me
one of them came in to tell me how dumb
i was because
it was clearly true that the cdc what
did he say
that the cdc has detailed statistics
on seasonal flu deaths
so this is a doctor coming in to dunk on
me for being dumb
by telling me that the cdc has detailed
that uh
information about this is the exact
quote from
dan friedman who's some kind of medical
person
and he said i and others did explain to
him
talking about me online here that the
cdt cdc keeps detailed flu data
no they don't no they don't
so this this guy's some kind of medical
expert
and he's coming into me and he doesn't
even know that the cdc
doesn't keep seasonal flu detailed
data they do an estimate
but they don't count them they can't
tell you
you know the details of some specific
person
that's not a thing so here's the expert
who knows less about this
than i do i'm a freaking cartoonist
all right i just read some articles and
and looked into some things people
tweeted at me and that's it
and somehow i knew more about it than
this doctor who's coming into the public
to
try to dunk on me um
here's the other question and then
somebody else
who was also in the medical field was
sending me a bunch of anecdotal stories
stories in the news of individuals who
died from the seasonal flu
to make the case but and i was
questioning why i don't know anybody
who's ever died of a seasonal flu when
the numbers are similar to the number of
people who die from overdoses and
automobile accidents
but i know lots of those if it's the
same number of people
every year why do i always know the
automobile accidents and the overdoses
but i don't know anybody who's died of a
seasonal flu
now that's my question which is not a
statement i'm not making a statement
that the seasonal flu is somehow not
dangerous or whatever
i'm saying i can't understand how that
can make sense just explain it to me
because there's probably something to
learn in that if you could understand it
so here's a question i ask uh so some of
the examples that were sent to me
i read the first one and the the
headline is you know somebody died of
the flu
and then you get into it it's like it
had meningitis and something else
so clearly there was an underlying
condition so the very first example
that i say doesn't exist or i haven't
seen it
so somebody sends me an example of it
exists but i read it
and it's not it's had underlying
conditions
so i look at another one and it's
a young child died unexpectedly
and i said to myself did they do uh
autopsy
when a when a five-year-old dies of the
seasonal flu
and they say there's no underlying
condition
so they died of the flu is that because
they did an autopsy
and they have determined that there were
no other causes it was literally just
the flu
and this per this kid was entirely
healthy otherwise
do you think that happens no
no i don't know if it's ever happened i
think what happens is the doctor says
well this kid had flu symptoms
the kid died kids die of flus
died of the flu right
um somebody said would you ever know if
it's all been
faked well i don't know if faked is the
right word i wouldn't say that
but here's my point what does it mean to
say that a five-year-old dies of the
seasonal flu
when you know millions of other
five-year-olds did not
but let's say one does it's more than
one but let's say one does
does that mean that that kid died
healthy
there was nothing wrong with that kid
until the seasonal flu took the kid out
doesn't it seem more likely that there
was something about that kid's immune
response or
situation that was not quite entirely
standard now if your immune system
is not standard but you don't have any
challenge to it
are you healthy is
is a bubble boy healthy as long as he
stays in the bubble
because if he's in the bubble nothing
can hurt him but if he goes outside the
bubble
where normal people are i don't want to
say normal because everybody has a
some kind of medical problem but the
other people are
so the bubble boy goes outside and then
immediately catches something and dies
did the bubble boy die perfectly healthy
because the the bubble boy was perfectly
healthy yesterday
when he was in the bubble so he goes
outside
and he gets the infection and the
infection kills him so the cause of
death was the infection right
because otherwise the bubble boy was
perfectly healthy
obviously there's something wrong with
the bubble boy
in the sense that doesn't have the same
kind of immune system as everybody
outside the bubble
i would say it seems obvious on the
surface
that if millions of kids get the same
seasonal flu and don't die
but every now and then one does
isn't that more indica indicative that
there's something going on with that kid
that is at least non-standard
a type of immune system that maybe
hasn't been challenged yet
maybe one that's not fully developed one
that has
maybe overreactive so that it has too
much of a response
which i understand is actually the
problem with kids
so are we only arguing about the word
healthy
and is that science is it science to
argue
over the definition of a word because
what i see
is that somebody who has a non-standard
body situation that makes them less able
to survive the normal environment
doctors are calling them healthy
that's just a weird definition of a word
i would call them people who are
unhealthy they just haven't been
challenged yet by the environment which
will take them out
so when doctors are arguing
over the word health they're not really
arguing science are they
it doesn't seem like this is even good
thinking
at all um
and then others are saying that i'm
making a claim
dressed up as a question no there are
such things as questions
you can have a real question about
a fact that's important and in the news
and doesn't make sense
to your mind you can ask that question
look at the number of experts who tell
me i shouldn't ask the question
because they believe that asking the
question
is really my way of making a statement
without data
why would they assume i would do that
what what's my payoff for doing that
it's crazy mind reading you can have a
question
it's still okay you can go out and have
a question
but the funniest part is that these
doctors tried to shame
me off my point they tried to literally
embarrass me and insult me away from my
question
not answering the question at least not
answering it in a way that i find
incredible
but to shame me from even
asking it because they said it was
dangerous and that i'm a bad force and
i'm a bad
person because i'm asking a question
about the data
really that's where we are and others
others saying that i had a political
bias
what exactly is the political bias
of wondering how seasonal flu data
is collected because that's republican
or or what what the hell
does that have to do with politics i
can't think of anything that has
how is that even related is there some
republican who
is the only one who's questioning the
data and seasonal flu
i mean that so when you see the experts
completely unable to deal with simple
concepts
in reasoning their their mind reading
they're using analogies
they're trying to shame me off my point
telling me that i can't ask a question
because it looks like a statement to
other people
that's the quality of your experts
right now let me point out
another glaring problem when the experts
say
you cartoonist as they're talking to me
they say you don't know as much as we do
and therefore you should listen to the
experts that's not true
there are plenty of cases where the
where the let's say the client
of the patient knows more than the
doctor does
you want to hear some examples now do i
even need to give you an example
have you ever been in a situation where
your own condition
you knew more about it than the doctor
you were talking to
i'll bet every one of you i'll bet every
one of you
if you're old enough you've had a
situation where there was one condition
maybe only once in your life but at
least one condition
where you knew more about it than the
doctor you were talking about
all the time yeah look at look at the
comments look at the comments
now is that because the doctor is
unqualified
no it's because medicine is gigantic
it's a gigantic field even the doctor
has to look stuff up while you're in the
office
if i go into the office it's fairly
common
that the doctor says okay those symptoms
and they have to type it into the
computer and
see what comes up right so
uh and i'll give you a specific example
when i had a lot of people know i had
voice problems
years ago i lost my ability to speak and
it was mysterious and couldn't figure it
out
i ended up solving it myself using
google
because my doctors could not diagnose it
how common is it that people correctly
diagnose themselves when their doctor
missed it
pretty common right now i do take the
criticism that doctors hate it
when you've been doing your own google
search and you go in and you tell the
doctor what you have
i would hate that if i were a doctor and
i don't believe that most people
have the capability to do a google
search and diagnose themselves
accurately
you know better than a doctor can that's
not common
but it happens happened with me
so once i learned that my condition was
called this this thing called spasmodic
dysphonia
fairly rare i became sort of an expert
on spasmodic dysphonia
do you think that if i picked a hundred
doctors randomly
and put them in my room and said all
right 100 doctors chosen randomly
tell me everything you know about
spasmodic dysphonia
how many of the hundred would know as
much as
i do about a condition that i wrestled
with and researched and had to deal with
for years
none it would be exactly zero there
wouldn't be one person in the room
who came close not even close
to how much i know medically and
scientifically
about this one thing so
having spent you know 20 minutes looking
into the seasonal flu stuff do i know
more than the doctors
probably and it wouldn't even be unusual
you can see this exact situation here
was a doctor who thought that the
cdc keeps detailed flu records
i know that they don't because a doctor
told me
it was something else i saw online other
doctors looked into it
found out they never counted them it was
just an estimate all right
um so apparently doctors do not learn
reasoning skills uh in school and it
really shows at least with the ones who
are
on twitter and uh my book loser think
that you see behind me loser think um
talks about all of these reasoning
problems
that i just mentioned so i would
recommend
for medical school
and maybe for any other school that
loser think
should be um a required reading
now one of the things you're hearing a
lot of is that we should be teaching
children to spot fake news and we should
teach children how to
think and deal with the fact that you
know so much
manipulation is happening in the media
i don't know how to say this without
sounding like it's just a commercial
but loser think is the best way to do it
because it's written to be friendly and
easily digestible
and it's all the common thinking errors
that you see the experts use
the doctors in this case and i think it
should be required
now of course there's no way for you to
separate that from the fact that i'm the
author of the book
and wouldn't it be good for me if
everybody everybody read my book of
course
of course it would be um but i'm also
serious that it should be required
because you see professionals and
scientists getting out of school
who can't think and how much are they
going to help us without that
all right
mike lindell is in a interesting and
terrible situation
in which as you know he'd been
questioning the
credibility of the election he says that
it's cost them 65 million dollars in
businesses so far for one year
uh based on uh big stores like kohl's
bed bath and beyond and stuff
dropping him because the controversy now
the
the first thing i say is i am so opposed
to big companies dropping somebody's
product
because of what the ceo was saying
because
while i do not think that mike lindell
has uh
good data for his argument at least the
stuff i've seen i
i'm not seeing good sources for some
some of it
um he does have a right to do this
he has a right to say anything he wants
if he believes it's true well even if he
didn't believe it's true he has a right
he does believe it's true i think that's
obvious right
wouldn't you agree with me we're not
mind readers
but certainly there's no indication
whatsoever
that he doesn't think it's true and if
people can't say what they believe to be
true
in public without losing their business
i mean this is not like he insulted
somebody he didn't he didn't call
somebody out he didn't attack somebody
there's no hate speech here
this is literally love
basically mike lindell loves his country
he thinks there's a problem he thinks
that he wants to step in and fix it
at great personal expense great personal
expense
now i feel as if even if you think
everything that mike lindell says
is inaccurate and it might be
i feel like this is just the worst thing
in the world
that that this poor guy can't you know
say what he wants in public without
getting boycotted
all right but then of course he's got
more problems because dominion is suing
him for 1.3 billion dollars in
defamation
and this raises a really interesting
question
let me say you're dominion and you're
making this decision
do you have to sue this guy i feel like
you kind of have to right
because you know just as
mike lindell has free speech or should
have
to say whatever he wants so long as he
thinks it's true he's not hurting
anybody directly
then dominion also has a perfect right
to defend their company and sue him for
defamation
so i feel that kohl's and bed bath and
beyond and all those
it's just not their fight right
you guys need to stay out of the fight
because this is between dominion
and mike lindell and that's a fair fight
i don't think that dominion knows how
fair this fight is yet
so here's the part that i like about
this story
i wouldn't underestimate michael and
bell
that feels like a terminal mistake
because i don't know how the law works
but maybe somebody who does
i always have a lot of lawyers on these
live streams somebody who's a lawyer
there we go i'm seeing it in the
comments
who's saying this discovery process
baby doesn't this open up
mike lindell and his lawyers doesn't
this give them the ability
to look into dominion's software
wouldn't they have to have the right to
audit them
end to end to be able to
defend themselves in court or
and this is the part that maybe you'd
have to be a lawyer to know
or can the lawyers for dominion
so narrowly uh so narrowly restrict
their case
that lindell would have to prove his
allegations
without benefit of looking at their
software
because that might be the case it might
be that he's making a claim
that you can debunk without ever looking
into the code
in which case dominion is playing it
right
now if dominion can avoid um
any discovery if they can avoid
showing you know opening their kimono
and showing all their proprietary stuff
then they've made the right decision
business-wise
it's exactly what they should do
business-wise
if they can show their stuff or
if they can show their stuff and there's
no problem
i don't know if they can do it seems
impossible
um somebody's saying on bannon that
lindell said that was his strategy
to get dominion to sue him he has said
that
but that's also the sort of thing you
say after you find yourself in that
situation
so i don't question the fact that he may
have created an accidental advantage
i think it does put him in a stronger
position
than maybe the public is
is aware of because here's the thing do
you think
mike lindell sold
a zillion my pillows because he's not
persuasive
he's persuasive in fact i told you once
that i was going to do
a live stream in which i did nothing but
tell you how good his technique is
for persuading he uses every every known
method
science knows for persuasion in his
commercials and it's
it's jaw-droppingly effective that's why
he's so rich
he's so good at it what would happen
if you put mike lindell in a courtroom
with a jury full of my pillow customers
of which you know at least three or four
of them are gonna be
my my pillow customers right i mean he
sold a lot of pillows
i would love to see a lawyer
versus mike lindell but he'll probably
have his lawyers arguing the case
but i'd love to see him on on on trial
because while i don't i guess his
his video and that got taken down of
course
in which he made lots of allegations his
video was viewed
110
million times
the super bowl only gets 90 some million
people viewers
the super bowl mike lindell
got 110 million people to watch his
video about the election
all right if you're dominion voting
systems
and you're going into a persuasion
battle
with a guy who just made a video that
110 million people watched
he had just made a fortune selling a
freaking pillow
i gotta watch that i mean you want to
watch this fight
so on the surface you'd say to yourself
wow
1.3 billion dollar defamation suit looks
like dominion has all the cards they're
really going to
take mike lindell out and they might
that is one of the possibilities
you know my pillow could be on a
business a year from now that's that's a
very much a possibility
the other possibility is that they have
no idea how much skill
mike lindell possesses they just don't
know
because if they think those pillows sold
themselves
well they've got some they got some
surprises coming
so while i do not endorse the argument
that mike lindell makes about the
election the the stuff i've seen didn't
pass
my sniff test um you can't take away
from him his skill
this is gonna be fun and it might be the
first and only opportunity we have
for a little bit more transparency about
the digital part of the process michael
and della might be doing for the country
one of the greatest things that's ever
been done for the country
and at personal great personal sacrifice
that's happening right in front of you i
mean it's easy to imagine this oh he's a
gadfly
crazy guy wasting his money yadda yadda
it would be easy to make that argument
but also i believe it is completely true
he's a patriot i think that feels
unambiguously true again can't read
minds but
that feels safe right he's a patriot i
think that's unambiguous
wants to help the country at personal
risk
do you think do you really think that
mike lindell thought he would sell more
pillows
by challenging the election i don't
think so
i don't believe there was any point he
said i'm cleverly gonna
you know raise the profile of my brand
and sell more pillows
no he's a patriot he just put
65 million dollars of revenue
in just one year on the line
for you for you you
american citizens and and also citizens
of the world
i feel like this is um
one of the greatest services anybody
ever did for the american public
at one of the greatest costs now of
course you put military members
above this but within the civilian world
and first responders of course
but within the sort of suit-wearing
civilian world this might be one of the
greatest sacrifices anybody ever made
for the country
will it pay off i don't know
probably not if i had to guess i would
bet against it paying off
in terms of you know producing a benefit
greater than the cost
but i really appreciate this
i really appreciate this that he's doing
this
at personal risk and i hope it gives us
more visibility into the election
and that would be one of the greatest
services ever for this country
all right
that is what i wanted to talk about for
today
i know it's a little bit harder to
have fun with the news when trump is not
in it
but maybe this you know this these
lawsuits with the taxes and stuff
will bring us something and i guess
trump is also going to be a featured
speaker at
cpac so i don't know when that is but
it's going to happen soon
and then that will give us more news to
talk about
well thank you i i love you right back
um thoughts on merrick garland
yeah i watched only a little bit of
merrick garland talk
and he doesn't seem capable
did you have that did you have that
impression i feel as if
age has caught up to him he looks
not sharp let's just say that garland is
the
joe biden of the of of the attorney
generals
uh yeah now it could be that i'm
judging his mannerism and not his
brain in all likelihood his brain
is fine and his just his mannerism was
misleading but i don't know if you want
an attorney general
who presents himself as not mentally
capable
because that's how he looked to me and i
say that
not as an insult and i do believe i
would say this no matter what party he
was with
right i don't think it has anything to
do with politics
when people speak that haltingly
yeah and they have the sort of joe biden
presentation
with biden you could say maybe has
something to do with his um
speech difficulty uh i guess he had a
stutter when he was younger that he's
conquered
to his credit and um you know maybe
there's something there with garland too
that makes them speak in that halting
way
but it doesn't give me confidence at all
it does not give me kind yeah he looked
that's the word
befuddled he looked and acted
befuddled and i don't think there's
anything you want less
in your appointed top government
officials
than to appear befuddled in a situation
which you've prepared for
vigorously keep in mind he prepared for
this
vigorously one assumes right was i
wasn't there but
you don't just go walking into these
hearings you prepare
and he was prepared and still acted
befuddled
that's not a good look and by the way if
the
republicans decided to vote against his
nomination
because he seemed to be funneled that's
fair
even even if you know he doesn't have a
background that would suggest any
problem
just the fact that he couldn't pull off
the hearing itself
is all you need i mean you don't need a
better reason than that
um all right
somebody said barrett just walked in i
don't think she did
uh that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers still with me for a
moment
uh early onset
befuddlement
the central committee needs another
puppet somebody says
um scott how would you know the
difference between code
used on election day versus updated code
a good question i would leave this to
the programmers dancer
a lot of things have logs
so if there was a change in software it
might be logged in some file
that doesn't mean that couldn't be
falsified but it's the right question
the right question is is it even
possible
to look at look at like an image that
was
relevant on election day yeah that is
the right question
i think it might be but i don't know
that for sure
um somebody say
michigan erased the logs and antrim yeah
so certainly logs can be erased
and what what would you do if you were
on the jury let's say you were on the
jury i don't know if it'll be a jury
trial for mike lindell
guessing it will be i don't know um or
does it always have to be in these cases
i don't know the law on that
so
and i forgot what my point was doesn't
matter
uh
linkedin takes down racist anti-white
male stuff
yeah you know the anti
uh white people stuff is is getting
a bit out of hand at the moment
podcast recommendations tim ferriss is
probably the best
podcast that you probably already
watched joe rogan
um you're moving toward debunking
covides
with your flu question don't you no
no that's what my critics are saying and
that's that's dumb
frankly that's dumb uh there is
the questions i'm asking about the
regular flu and whether or not it's
appropriately coded do not apply
to something that apparently has killed
half a million people in a year
right the whole point about the seasonal
flu is
why doesn't the observation fit the
science
covid the observation fits the science
right they say a whole bunch of people
are dying
i've heard of personally a whole bunch
of people dying celebrities of dying
from it
no anything i say about the seasonal flu
does not prove anything about govit very
much does not
that's what my critics say and that's
just there's no logical connection
um do i recommend recommend stefan
molyneux you know i don't he got kicked
off of
social media i don't even know where
you'd find his
stuff but he's he's very talented
if you can take an edgier uh let's say
uh a a presentation which gives no
credit to wokeness
definitely good content yeah brett
weinstein
i hear he's good
peter principal doctors now you know
what i think it is is that
i think doctors if you become really
smart
at one field i feel as though
it can fool you into thinking
you know more than you know
uh the young turks i don't recommend
them now
somebody's saying i i beat up stefan
that's not true we did have a good
conversation
he's fun to talk to you because even
when you disagree
with stefan molyneux
his point of view is going to be well
well presented
so at least it's always a fair fight
um all right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you
he has sticks sticks and hammer that
would be a great one i always watch him
uh tim pool yeah
excellent all right that's enough for
now i'll talk to you later
