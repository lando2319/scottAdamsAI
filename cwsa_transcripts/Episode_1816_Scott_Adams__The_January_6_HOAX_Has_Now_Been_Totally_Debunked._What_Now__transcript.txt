good morning everybody and welcome
to what i think will be a highlight of
civilization and certainly your life
no matter how exciting it is it's about
to take it up a level
and if you'd like to join me in this
experience raising your awareness
raising your metabolism
really making everything better all you
need is a copper mug or a glass of tank
or jealousy just die in the canteen
sugar flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine today i think
it makes everything better
watch this go
ah that was somewhere between a sip and
a gulp
it was more of a
soap
and that's how words are created
by writers
yeah i just created a word it's a
sulphur
well what's happening in the news that
will entertain us and delight us
oh let's see
uh autonomous killer drone robots
oh
so the united nations is uh trying to
get together and to decide
if autonomous murderous
drones should be legal in war
because you know there's one thing you
don't want to happen in war
it's killing people
so
if you could make it safer to go to war
seems like a good idea to me
i'd love a good war with no casualties
that would be ideal
but
do you think it's a good idea or a bad
idea to have autonomous murder robots
that might go out and autonomously
murder people
because what if they murder the wrong
people
yes that's never happened in war has it
um am i missing something
isn't the alternative to swarms of
murderous autonomous drone robots
the alternative is just artillery right
how how in the world could you be angry
about
a tool that's designed to uh
you know to be smart about what it hits
should we use the dumb kind where you
just shoot big bombs into
clusters of civilization
i feel like we have to compare this to
the alternative don't we
that's always that's always the problem
that we have in politics
we look at something as though the
alternative is some kind of a perfect
situation
huh
should we have autonomous killer drones
or everybody live in peace
drones murdering innocent people
or everybody live in peace i think
everybody will live in peace would be a
better one
would you like to debate it i think
everybody living in peace would be way
better
than autonomous murder drones
but
suppose you
compare that to the alternative
correct me if i'm wrong but autonomous
murder drones are going to kill
leadership
right
why would you why would you waste your
autonomous murder drones that can
identify people
why would you use them to murder
civilians
or even
artillery
i guess you'd go after the artillery
but it's kind of a tool to go after
leadership isn't it
i would like more of that not less
in fact i would like all of our military
hardware to be designed to kill the
leaders of the other countries and not
kill anybody else
and if they make stuff that only kill
our leaders but don't kill me
well
i'm not going to hate that
rasmussen has a poll that says
uh one in five voters think it would be
good if uh good for the democrats
if biden does not run for reelection
so here's
uh
so here's the question which must be
asked
so what only one in five things
of democrats think
uh
no voters
actually so it's voters not democrats so
one in five voters that could be both
republicans and independents and
democrats
thank you don't think it would be good
for biden to run for re-election
um
i think that's fair
now here's my question to the people who
voted for biden
if you voted for biden
because you didn't want the guy who lies
to be in office
how did that work out oh i know i know i
know what you're going to say yeah yeah
yeah
sure
maybe biden lies too
and you know get granted that was his
main reason for wanting
to replace trump that was his
proposition and sure enough we just
replaced trump with another gigantic
liar
but but at least biden's effective
[Laughter]
moving on
um
tom cotton is getting some heat from
representative liz cheney i guess tom
cotton went on a show and said some bad
things about the january 6 thing
but it turns out he has not watched much
of the live coverage
so tom cotton a sitting senator
can you believe that
he hasn't spent really much time at all
watching an obvious hoax on television
what's wrong with that guy
well what the hell is he doing instead
of watching a hoax playing out on
television
is he wasting his time trying to stop
fentanyl shipments from the cartels oh
yeah he is
right that's what he's doing
he's trying to stop fentanyl shipping
into the united states trying to stop
china
from owning the united states
i'm sorry
did he not spend enough time watching
your brainwashing
propaganda hoax
well that's what liz shady says she says
hey sen senator tom cotton heard you on
hugh hewitt criticizing the january 6
hearings
then you said the strangest thing you
admitted you hadn't watched any of them
zing
zing i gotcha
i got you you admitted you haven't
watched any of my completely useless
 propaganda so what do you say
to that when you're out there wasting
your time trying to stop fentanyl
shipments to the united states
is there any new story i can do without
making that face
i just realized you can't talk about the
news without making that face
because everybody's just such a
idiot right now
that you can't even treat it like it's
serious i mean not really
you can't treat it like it's serious
seriously
liz jd thinks that tom cotton should
spend more time watching her hoax
she's already debunked herself
the entire january 6th thing proved
there was nothing there oh oh there was
something there
yeah let's get to that let's see it
started out number one that trump
attempted a planned insurrection of the
united states wow that's pretty bad
wow wow
wow
trump planned
he planned an insurrection
okay loosely planned
loosely planned but still he loosely
planned a insurrection of the
united
okay well he didn't loosely plan
anything turns out nothing was planned
but he encouraged it he
encouraged
an insurrection
okay he didn't actually encourage it
but he didn't try to stop it he didn't
try to stop it
all right he did try to stop the
violence but he should have done more he
should have done more
let me
accept this standard for a moment
because i think it's a useful one
i believe the standard of should have
done more
and should have done it sooner should be
the new standard by which we judge all
of congress
everybody raise your hand if you agree
unanimous unanimous
uh and by the way
oh here's a here's a coincidence
i wrote a book called loserthink a few
years ago
and there's a chapter in it
talking about how loser thinkish it is
to say that something good should have
been sooner done sooner and better
because you know what else should be
done sooner and better
everything that's good
no exceptions
if it's good it should have been
done sooner
and better
do you know what else should have been
done sooner
and better
the january 6 hearings
it was a four-hour event that was
completely reversed by the second day
the actual january 6th thing so the the
attempt in the delay didn't work next
day everything was back to normal it
took him a year and a half to put on the
hearings
really this is the big critical question
in the country and you take a
year and a half to put it on television
how about doing your job how about you
should have done a lot more
and a lot sooner if you thought this was
the most critical issue if it's not the
most critical issue what the are
you spending your time on it for
maybe you should be helping tom cotton
stop the fentanyl flow into this country
instead of wasting your time
with a show trial that's obviously
political except to democrats
that you've gaslighted so thoroughly
that they will believe that monkeys
could fly out of your ass just
because it was on cnn
so let's let's use that uh let's use
that standard by the way so
remember i told you that reality and
parody have merged
the january 6th thing
literally devolved into a punch line in
my book
that actually happened it actually
devolved to the actual
the remaining claim is that he didn't do
enough fast enough
it's literally a chapter in my
book about how not to be an
and they walked right into the
thing
oh let's be an and say should
have been sooner and better everything
should have been sooner and better every
 thing how's the fentanyl uh
trade going liz how much time did you
spend trying to stop deadly fentanyl
coming into the country
none
was it because you were watching your
own useless propaganda
is that why you didn't do a
thing that the american public
elected you to do
well don't worry you won't get elected
again you're not going to have to have
to make that decision again
and thank you for guaranteeing trump's
return which is nothing i wanted at all
let me say it as clearly as i possibly
can
i don't want a president
who's too old for the job
trump is too old for the job now i think
he's probably in great shape blah blah
blah individual differences blah blah
blah blah all of that it's just too
old there's a reason we have to we that
we have age limits on everything right
sure
there is an 18 year old who's smart
enough or somebody under 18 who's smart
enough to vote
well not many of them
not many of them
all right
um but now that the january hearings
basically have cleared trump of all
wrongdoing and reduced it down to the
most ridiculous
charge
didn't do enough soon enough
during
the fog of war
imagine you're president trump and it's
january 6.
imagine the information that was coming
in
most of it wrong
right now i don't know what he heard and
what he didn't but in that situation is
most of the early information you get
correct
or is it mostly wrong and unreliable
it's mostly wrong and unreliable
that's what the fog of war refers to a
new you know multi-variable situation
that's popping up and you don't have
direct visibility on it
all he knew is what people told him and
what he saw on tv
how reliable are those two sources what
you saw in the news
and what people told you
those are the two most unreliable
sources of information you could ever
have in the fog of war
so did did he not act soon enough
not not from my um point of view
i don't think he acted soon enough
now here's the real question
if he put liz cheney in that same fog of
war
would she have known what to do
i doubt it
not right away
because she also would have been in the
fog of war and people would be telling
her conflicting things for four hours
right do you think that people were
telling trump one thing
hey hey you better stop this no no you
can guarantee that you heard every
opinion
and that they're all different
although some people said you know
that's a there's a little bit of
violence but it looks like it'll be
controlled
it's more important that the people get
to speak we know it's a messy system but
let the people speak let's see how this
plays out
you don't think somebody was telling him
to let's see how it played out
of course there were
of course there were were they right to
say wait to see how it plays out i don't
know
did they know if they were right but
they couldn't it was fog of war could
trump know who was right he couldn't
he couldn't it's not knowable
in the fog of war you don't have
information
so you wait until things clear up
did he wait too long in retrospect yes
but if you'd been in that situation
would you have known to do something
faster maybe
maybe
but do you know that no you don't know
that
you don't know that
stop acting like you know
that if you'd been in his situation
you would you would have seen the danger
which we didn't learn about for a
 year and a half right i mean not
in its completion how much do you think
he actually knew
during that
tumultuous period
not enough
he definitely didn't know enough to know
how it would turn out under each
scenario
so did he act slowly
and not do enough to stop violence in my
opinion
he did not act in my opinion he should
have done more
and he should have done it sooner
but
if you take that to the next level and
say that if you were in that situation
you would have known better
that's crazy
there's there's no
there's nothing that suggests that's
true
everything suggests that somebody in
that situation would be in a really
tough spot for decision making
not only would you be in deep
cognitive dissonance
theoretically
you know no matter who you are take
trump out of the equation
take any normal brain
put it put it in the job of president
be sure that you really won
and then be told that you didn't
it's not a small thing
it's a second term for president of the
united states
it's for all the marbles
everything in your life depends on that
if you put any normal brain in that
situation what would be the predictable
outcome
of that human brain
cognitive dissonance
not only would it be predictable
it's damn near guaranteed
damn near guaranteed
now do you notice we never treat uh
medic mental situations as medical until
you need to
right we're all we're all willing to act
like mental stuff
doesn't count as like a medical problem
unless you're really forced into it
but what is cognitive dissonance
is that is that a mental disease
it's not
you know necessarily because it doesn't
last
might not affect your life
but in this situation there's no
reasonable way to assume that he was
capable of making good decisions
and you could replace him with
anyone and they would be in the same
situation
anyone who would anyone who had
experienced what trump experienced
would not be able to make good decisions
so did he make a good decision i doubt
it
because nobody could
i couldn't in that situation i would not
be able to make a good decision
so i mean we could have gotten lucky and
maybe a good decision was made but to
imagine the skill or or good intentions
or you know anything that's happening in
your brain would have helped you in that
situation that's that's very unsupported
assumption
not only is it unsupported it's the
least likely possibility that you would
have done a better job
right
many of you think you would have done a
better job
in a generic way
here's what i tell myself
well at the very least i would have made
a lot more noise about being peaceful
right
don't you all tell yourself that well at
the very least
i would have really been noisy about be
peaceful
but he probably thought he did
if you're the president of the united
states how many times do you have to say
it
right
everybody's paying attention to trump
if he tweets be peaceful and he says be
peaceful in his speech
those are the two ways he communicated
that day he gave a speech and he tweeted
and in both of those he said be peaceful
do you think he was thinking he didn't
do enough
i think he thought he did enough
i think he was busy
and he was in the fog of war and when
somebody said did he tell everybody to
be peaceful he probably thought yeah i
did twice
like what else do we have to talk about
i mean he had everything going on and he
was in exactly the type
of situation where you wouldn't trust
anyone to make a decision
let me say it again it doesn't matter if
it's biden or clinton or or trump it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter that it
doesn't matter the age the person the
gender the political party the race none
of it
what matters is you put any normal brain
in that situation
where they're positive something sketchy
happened that that really changed the
nature of not only the country
but their life in an irreversible way
nobody goes through that unscathed
no normal brain can survive that
they gaslit him until it broke his
 brain
but he got through it
he got through it
like he he managed to get through that
and
he's coming back
now
if you ask me would i support trump for
a second run
i say unambiguously no
under normal situation
under a normal situation no
no no the age alone is out i i'd like uh
tom cotton maybe
you know desantis maybe they'd be fine
in fact i'd be fine with either one of
them right
i'd even be fine with maybe some
you could hate to hear this i could
imagine being fine with a democrat
sorry
[Laughter]
sorry
i did support bill clinton i don't know
if any of you know that
but i thought he was a he was a pretty
good president
that's my opinion
um
so
so here's the thing
under normal situation absolutely i
would not pick trump as my first choice
but there's nothing normal about this
situation
do you know why i chose him the first
time
because i wanted to break
all of this stuff
i wanted to just put a spear in it
like i didn't care what he built i only
wanted him for what he could break
you needed some demolition before you
can even talk about construction
i trust the united states and the
american people to construct
do you know what we're good at
we're good at building stuff
americans are really good at building
stuff
if you knock down our building we'll
build that back
right you you knock down our
our organization we'll we'll build it
back
we build back and i hate to use some
guidance
binding saying but we do build back
better we actually do that that's you
know that part of the saying works
perfectly
and
the part that we're not good at
what's the part we're not good at as
americans
breaking the we already have
right
but we do it better than anybody
and if i had to say there's one thing
that defines americans i mean you could
think of lots of things but the one
thing i like to look at that defines
americans
is that we're willing to break our
to build better
like nobody
right like we we have less investment in
the past than any society i think
i mean it feels like that obviously
obviously i'm you know jingoistic
american kind of point of view
so i'm sure you think your country does
that too but the point is and there may
be lots of countries that are in that
situation but i think
sometimes you need
demolition
and sometimes you need construction
i'm confident we can always build things
i'm not confident we always have the
right assets to
do the demolition
and when i see this january 6 stuff and
i see you know what's happened to us
i feel like we need demolition again
i feel like we need it again
so if trump could get back and simply
destroy all these hoaxes
and have a strong vice president
i would support him
just to destroy the system
it feels like the response that the
country needs
like the country needs him to just come
back and
break this stuff again
and i don't even care if he served the
whole term you know if he got
if he had a good year and broke some
stuff and changed some things and then
vice president took over that that'd be
fine for me
um
well
so what else we got going on here lots
of stuff today
um
did everybody see my epstein thread
i don't know why i even tweeted this
i i just had this thought i thought well
this will cause some trouble
all right i'm gonna go through the
thread
and the argument is this
that the most likely explanation for
everything we know about the epstein
situation
is that he's still alive
now i'm not alleging he's alive
i know you want to hear this part
clearly i'm not saying he's live
that's not my allegation
i'm saying if you look at the evidence
that is presented to the public
it says equally likely actually more
likely than the other alternatives
here's why
listen to this argument
i'll read it just the way i tweeted it
i said remember when you were sure
epstein died
if i were in charge of creating the
illusion
i'd make sure you thought past the sale
to the question of how he died was his
suicide was he murdered suicide or
murdered because if you can get somebody
to think past the sale
they get trapped in a mental loop
and they can't go back
and check the question that mattered
how do you know he's dead
right how do you know he's dead
well how do you know he's dead
have you ever asked yourself that what
sources do you rely on to know that he's
dead
well
um we know that uh here's what we know
so
so instead of looking at the things we
don't know yet let's see what we know
we know elaborate hoaxes are a routine
part of the top echelon of politics i
didn't know that before
five years ago i literally did not know
that the government was in the routine
business of creating elaborate hoaxes
with characters and plots and story arcs
i thought that was too complicated and
there would be too many witnesses it
just didn't seem like it could be done
but then we watched it being done right
in front of us
we watched it being done over and over
again you know i've got a 12
12 things on a list of obvious hoaxes
that the public bought in some some
fashion
so if we know that elaborate hoaxes with
like characters and players and things
are routine
would you by my first assumption that as
of 2022 it could be stated as a fact
that complicated multi-variable
hoaxes
are routine
they're not even unusual anymore right
would you buy that
okay
so let's buy that big hoaxes are just a
routine now
and we know for example that 50x intel
professionals were willing to lie about
hunter's laptop
they got 50 people to publicly lie about
hunter's laptop
and risk their careers
but of course it didn't matter because
we just forget
and what about the same
probably a lot of the same intel
professionals were behind the russia
collusion hoax
this is our own intelligence agencies
this isn't the other countries
this is american intelligence agencies
we're behind and i don't know how much
behind but certainly supported the
russian collusion hoax if not created it
themselves
and
those are the things we know about
how many things do we not know about
i mean think about we these are the
things we know about and they just
happened these are like recent news
and
here's the other assumption don't you
assume i think everybody assumes this
that epstein had a trove of videos for
blackmail
don't you think he had enough blackmail
i mean even if it even if it were only
videos of people on the island that'd be
enough
and where is it
why is that that you and i have never
seen any any leaked video from epstein
never any mention that there's some
might some might exist that they found
right
interesting
and why is it that we've never seen the
list of his
clients i mean you think by now
so what are the possibilities for why
we have not seen what we all assume
exists a trove of blackmail videos
what's the most
logical reason we haven't seen them
could it be
because people who were powerful
got their hands on all of the copies
how likely is that
if you were a rich person and you had
been to his island and you were afraid
that he had video
even if you could ask him to give you
the video or delete it and you watched
him do it
would you believe that the video was
missing
if you were the rich person would you
believe that epstein had gotten rid of
all of his copies even if he told you
you did of course not you would
definitely not believe it
he would epstein would be crazy to
delete all of his copies
i i had a blackmailer myself
and you know asked the blackmailer to
delete some stuff
didn't
pretended to delete it didn't of course
now in my case it won't be a problem but
uh
you know blackmailers don't delete their
their material if they don't have to
they just tell you they did if it's
digital
all right
and by the way nobody had anything on me
that i cared about
um
but they tried
it's the life of famous people
getting blackmailed
having stalkers show up it's like it's
just my normal
like a normal life for me
being robbed of you know tens of
thousands of dollars being targeted for
every kind of crime and hit piece
normal day
i i did sign up for it so i don't
complain it's just a it's just a fact
all right back to epstein
all right so we know that elaborate
hoaxes are possible and we wonder why
all of his blackmail material never came
out
what is the most logical
explanation for why we haven't seen any
of his blackmail material
and
and it's gone this far
the most logical way the most logical
explanation is that he's still alive
leaving him alive is the best way to
keep your secret safe for as long as
possible
killing him almost guarantees that
you're going to be
you know dead from your own blackmail
information that's going to come out
let me ask you this
what would be harder to pull off
a murder
a planned murder
inside a secure prison
for somebody who you know is at risk and
has cameras on him and is being watched
what would be harder to pull off the
murder in the prison
or to pull off
taking him out of the prison and faking
his death with some
photos and photoshop
which would be harder
i think killing him would be harder
i think getting him out of there alive
would be easier and here's why
in both cases you need insiders
right
i mean we we assume that the guards were
not coincidentally asleep we assumed
that the cameras were not coincidentally
not working
right we all assumed that
so there was some insider involvement as
long if if you're going to assume
insider involvement well then anything's
possible
just opening the door and having him
walk out
would be the easiest solution and then
you know
fake that he
something happened now you say to
yourself scott scott's got too many
people involved
you got the coroner you've got the this
and then that you know all these people
involved
do you know what else had lots of people
involved
the russia collusion hoax
how many people were involved in
that
a lot
a lot
so it turns out that the the old
argument of there were too many people
involved so it couldn't be a hoax
that doesn't hold anymore
every hoax that has been uh perpetrated
against the american people
has had lots of people involved
all of them
and it doesn't seem to matter
my common sense tells me that that
should matter but we've seen example
after example where it didn't matter
for various reasons i don't know why
but it doesn't matter
so
there's the bottom line
um i'm not saying that epstein's alive
i'm just saying that the if i were to
rank the likelihood of each of these
cases it would be this rank
most likely not guaranteed
the most likely explanation is still
live
and was taken out by you know
important people who can do that sort of
thing
the number two possibility this is just
my opinion
is that it was a contract killing by a
victim's family in other words some
victims family said you know
for ten thousand dollars i can get some
bad person to to wax this guy
now have you ever thought about that if
somebody did something terrible to you
and they got caught and they went to
prison but you weren't happy with prison
being enough
have you ever thought to yourself how
hard would it be to pay somebody in
prison to kill them
okay i do think about those things
and i think it's probably not that
expensive is it
your
family or your kid ten thousand dollars
if you kill this guy in prison because
you're in prison for life either way
but your kid will get ten thousand
dollars i feel like it's cheap do you
think there's no
family member who could afford ten
thousand dollars and
you know didn't know somebody who could
get it done
i i put that at the second most likely
possibility a contract killing from a
victim's family
then three i would say guard assisted
suicide meaning that epstein himself
may have bribed the guards to pretend to
be asleep and turn off the cameras
uh because he wanted to kill him and
maybe they helped in some way it's
everything
i think the least likely is that he was
murdered in prison to bury his secrets
two reasons one it's too on the nose
because everybody thought he would be
murdered in prison and then oh yeah he's
murdered in prison
it's too on the news
doesn't mean it didn't happen right
when i used that two on the nose thing
doesn't mean it didn't happen
it just means that's a big red flag that
happened exactly the way people thought
exactly the way
that's a little too close
and
so that's one thing that raises the flag
the second thing is that it wouldn't
work
and everybody knows it wouldn't work
if the idea was to kill him to keep his
secrets buried
nobody thinks that would work
because everybody assumes somebody else
has a copy
wouldn't you
wouldn't you if you were the blackmailer
you wouldn't have
an auto release copy somewhere that says
if something happens to me this is going
to be released of course you would i
would
i mean i'm not
i'm no epstein and even i would think
that
so that's my bottom line most likely
possibility is live you're going to say
to me but scott what about the
what about the autopsy
what about that uh
what about that x-ray of his neck with
the bone that broken bone in his neck
how hard would it be to get an x-ray of
somebody with a broken bone in their
neck
it can't be that hard
apparently that's a common thing that
people break
apparently there are enough people have
broken that exact bone that the medical
community could talk about it as a like
a common thing
right so
yeah and and if you uh if you were to
google
or i'm sorry um
if you say to yourself but i i saw a
video of his autopsy or i saw a photo of
him dead or there was somebody who
testified that he's dead
we can't trust any of that anymore
can we
we can't trust photos we can't trust
videos we certainly can't trust
people reporting to us
none of that's reliable
so
again i'm not saying that
that epstein is alive i'm saying it's
the only
hypothesis that fits all of the facts
it's the only hypothesis
that fits all of the facts
the rest of them fit a lot of facts
but there's only one
that fits all of them
so for what that's worth
all right matt gates is making some uh
news
so i guess he was at the
what's the name of that event
tp usa or something it was at the
young republican event and
he was noting that the abortion
protesters
tend to be unattractive and overweight
and why is it that the people who most
concerned about abortion rights are the
ones you at least want to impregnate
he said
but no one wants to impregnate
impregnate you if you look like a thumb
he actually said that no no one wants to
impregnate you if you look like a thumb
so he was asked by a reporter
is it safe to say
after the event based off your comments
you're suggesting that those women at
these abortion rallies are ugly and
overweight and gage says
yes
and then the reporter says
well what do you say to the
people who were offended by that
and he said
be offended
and then he was done
now here's what's interesting
if you do to matt gates what was done to
matt gates
which is you take everything from him
at least career-wise
you take everything from him
the democrats took everything from them
i mean they removed his ability to be
present effectively
and
what do you do when you've when you have
nothing to lose
what happens
what happens if you have nothing to lose
i don't know if this is going to happen
but it might
gates might go full truth
and that
would be the best show
you've ever seen
he might i don't know if he will but if
you put me in a position where i lost
everything
i would go full truth
and it looks like he started
i don't know if he's going to like carry
this ball forward
but there is something that americans
love
about telling the truth
you need to go uh google uh bill burr in
philadelphia when he uh
i guess the crowd was getting on
somebody and he took the stage somebody
was a comedian and he took the stage he
spent i think 12 minutes
just insulting the insulting the
audience
like really deeply insulting them and to
the point where he thought oh my god
this isn't even funny anymore he's just
he's just ripping them a new for
12 minutes by the end of the 12 minutes
it was like a standing ovation
americans love honesty
and bill berg just gave them
like the most ugly honesty anybody ever
dumped on anybody and they all said yay
yay all right we like that
yeah we like that we didn't like those
jokes
but all this ugly honesty give us some
more of that we're americans we can take
it
yeah so
i don't know this is
this might be foreshadowing
if it is foreshadowing he's on the verge
of becoming the most interesting person
in the country
maybe
we'll see
well it turns out monkey pox is sort of
real
it's being called an epidemic i guess
now national emergency or
international emergency so i think
they're around 3 500 cases in the united
states
um and now we're getting some guidelines
about how not to catch it
and i'd like because i like to do
helpful things on my live live stream
i'm going to give you some tips
for not getting monkey pox
if you see a somebody who has open
blisters on their body
don't lick those blisters
if you see somebody with open blisters
take a shower
and put that wet towel hanging on a hook
don't use that towel
that's a that's an actual guideline
actually real i'm not even making that
that one up
um if you see somebody who is uh
coughing and sick they have a fever and
they have open sores on their body
and you're really horny
masturbate
so
that's your
sort of my medical advice
just you know
just just start yanking but stay away
from that monkey box infected person no
matter how horny you are
um
if if a monkey pox person dies in a bed
don't sleep in that bed
until you wash the sheets
so i know a lot of this will be uh a lot
of extra effort for you
a lot of you are gonna say well i like
to lick people's open source
oh why are you telling me how to live
well i know it's individual situation
so if you don't want
the country to be closed down again
stop licking people with open source
stop using their towels
and if they
if they're ready to sneeze do not run
over there and put your face in front of
it these are all not recommended
not recommended at all
all right
so that's your monkey box
advice for the day now if you don't do
those things apparently there's not much
chance you're going to get it
so
yeah we have there's good advice over
here
um over on the locals platform that's
good advice
somebody said uh if
rather than licking somebody who has
open sores
just put your penis in them but don't
don't try to touch them or breathe in
any way
excellent advice
yeah you shouldn't listen to me for
anything really
well biden has signed an executive order
to spend a billion dollars to federalize
the zuckerberg ballot box situation
so that the government will run what i
guess the zuckerberg people funded
privately so hud and other federal
agencies will
be in charge of this
so you know every time somebody makes a
change to the election
system i say to myself
well why'd that take so long
if this was worth doing why'd it take so
long
and
if they're trying to make the elections
more secure
why
why why would you try to make the
elections more secure what would be the
point of that i mean because we've
already been told that they're
completely secure
we've never had a problem
so why would you fix something that
isn't broken
oh is it because they've been lying to
us and of course it's broken and of
course it's not transparent and of
course you can't audit it fully of
course you don't know if your vote got
to the final database of course you
don't
but they're going to tell you at the
same time that it works perfectly and
we're gonna fix it
they're not just gonna build back better
they're literally building it back the
way it was
so they're saying the elections are
perfect
but we're gonna build back to make them
the same as they are
by
bill wait
okay i guess none of it makes sense
bottom line
uh demolition yes they need some
demolition
all right have i covered all of the
topics
is this the best live stream you've ever
seen in your life
come on
come on
all right now here's my question
uh i know that fox news
hannity tucker
et cetera have said that the and i think
uh mark levin probably others the
opinion people have said that nothing
has come out of the
january 6 hearings
how how long has uh fox news been saying
that trump has been exonerated
by the hearings
did it start around friday this last
week or they've been saying that for
longer
now greg guffeld said it also on
so is that now um is that going to
become the
the fox or the right-leaning narrative
that it exonerated trump
is that going to be the narrative from
the right because
in my opinion it's not a narrative in my
opinion that's literally just what
happened
they went after him for a bunch of
serious charges and found there was
nothing there
that's what it looked like to me
so
if republicans are just treating it
like there's some kind of ongoing thing
and some allegations came up they're
really missing the boat on this
what they should say is they should
honor this january 6 hearings and say
you know i was skeptical but it did show
that the president was
you know didn't do anything uh wrong
except the fog of war decisions
which you understand
and so we're glad that that was all
aired because it cleared the path for
him to run
and even if you don't think he should be
the president isn't it good that this
hoax was cleared up
so
the best
most effective persuasion you can do
against an enemy
let's say an opponent i don't like to
say enemy an opponent
is to agree with them
it's a real baller move
and say you know i didn't respect that
january 6th thing but i have to admit
once all once all of the allegations
were aired it makes us feel a lot better
that there was no problem there so let's
move on
if you if you brand the january 6th
thing as a valid process that cleared
trump it will drive them crazy
if you want to make the democrats
actually crazy
embrace the january 6th thing
say you were a skeptic at first
but it did show that the president you
know didn't do the things that were
alleged and we thank them for their
service
yeah you still have to do something
about the political prisoners
that's not cool and by the way as long
as there are january 6 political
prisoners i i'm balls to the wall for
trump
they just forced my hand and i don't
want to be it's not my first choice
but
that that's sort of a red line
political prisoners of people who look
like me
that's a red line
you cross the line on that
right you know and i have to say it
would have taken a lot
to make me unambiguously pro-trump for a
second term it would take a lot
because he's not cheap
am i right
like he cost me money
because you know my career takes a hit
with any reputational
you know association
it's terrible for me so you have to push
me pretty hard to make me go
unambiguously pro-trump in this
situation
but putting people in jail because they
look and talk and act like me
well that's over the line
so if it takes a trump
to unfuck that
i will take him every day
if the only thing that will unfuck that
is trump
and it looks like it is
i will i will i will support that every
day and i don't care what else he does
i don't care what else just do that
i could be a single issue voter on that
no problem
your career would take a hit with
support of any republican probably true
at trump gates 2024
that would be the ultimate you
party trump and gates
the the no apologies
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
i hope i didn't just see the future
but if trump and matt gates ran as a
team
and his slogan was no apologies
it's over it's over
just a big bust that says no apologies
and it's over
do you know how many people want to hear
no apologies
a hundred percent of republicans
he would get a hundred percent of the
vote
he would be the first candidate who got
a hundred percent of the vote from his
party and he wouldn't even need to
propose any policies he'd just say no
apologies
that's it no apologies
wow
you know as soon as i thought of that
like the the no apology to her
like you could feel it couldn't you it
almost feels like the future
like i don't think it is like my brain
doesn't think it is but why does it feel
like it is
it feels just like that's the future
right
how many of you have the same impression
when i said it
you got goosebumps yeah that felt like
the future didn't it
you know i only had this i i've had this
experience
once that i can remember well twice
actually
twice twice i've had an experience where
i thought i actually saw the future
more than that but two that i'll talk
about
uh once it was when somebody suggested
that a little cartoon character i was
drawing in the office
should have a name and the name should
be dilbert
the moment i heard that name
i and i've told this story before i felt
myself pulled down a tunnel
to the future
and then i saw it
i saw dilbert in the future
and as soon as i saw it i was like holy
 i got pulled back down the tunnel
back to the present again
and i sat in the present saying
ah
something just happened
and i actually saw the future
and by the way the future played out
just like i saw it
now could be coincidence could be
optimism right the other time that i had
that sensation
was when trump entered the race
and i just saw him winning
i just saw it that's the main reason i
wrote about it is that i couldn't
explain a i don't know
a weird
vision
like that just sounds crazy and even i
think you know it's probably just a
mental thing
but
um i felt it i felt it like it was real
and then it happened
when i said no apologies and i thought
of trump and gates
it just felt like it's already happening
in the future
doesn't it
i mean it actually feels like it's
already happening
but in the future
it doesn't feel like
like imaginary
it's weird
now i'm gonna i'm gonna bet against it
because that that would be the weirdest
specific prediction in the world so i'm
gonna bet against it
but i'm gonna call out the fact that it
feels like it already happened
and some of you felt it too right
i once uh
had an experience with a psychic
i don't believe in psychics but i had
this experience
in which the psychic said that the past
and the present
are the same thing
we just don't realize it
and that sometimes you can see that see
the future
actually accurately but you're not
really seeing the future because the
future and the past and the present are
not really separate
you're actually just seeing what is
there
all right so i don't even know what that
means but it sounded cool when i said it
yeah maybe it's just cognitive
dissonance who knows
maybe we saw the potential
but
in terms of motivating me
what i most want to do is stop
apologizing
it's weird that's my that's my
i didn't realize it until i said no
apologies but
um i feel like that's one of my
strongest urges right now and i didn't
really even know it
yeah
uh what about legit apologies
um
the trouble is
other people always think the apology or
the need for it is legit
so if you let other people tell you
what you should apologize for you're
right back to apologizing for everything
because they always have a reason
so you either have to never apologize
or you're apologizing for a lot i don't
think there's much middle ground
can you ever apologize enough for being
white i'm being asked
i don't think it's possible but you know
the way i see all the racial stuff is
just uh
power dynamics
you know if you could say something
about another group to reduce their
power and increase your power
people do it so i mean that's all that's
happening
um
all right
yeah
the trouble with apologizing is that it
focuses on the past
now in a personal
in a personal situation apologizing
makes a lot more sense
because the apology is more about
showing you have empathy for the person
it's not even so much about the past
but that doesn't apply so much for
apologies in public
those are just performance nobody really
feels those apologies
um
yeah i did see the interview between um
i'm being prompted the lex friedman
interview with donald hoffman
is highly recommended by the way lex
friedman
and donald hoffman do it do google on
that you won't you won't regret it that
is fascinating interview
i don't think you're going to see
matt
matt gates be picked as a vice president
today
somebody said that on youtube here's why
it won't happen today
because if it were going to happen today
matt gates would not have caused trouble
the day before
the fact that matt gates went you know
full face into trouble
with not even a pause
suggests that he's not trying to make
trump happy at the moment which means
he's not already selected for vice
president
doesn't mean he won't be
but uh it means he's not
that decision definitely has not been
made
all right
uh i shouldn't use the word no in no
apologies uh
i see what you're saying because the the
brain
sees the active word and not the no word
but i think in this one instance this
would be a worthy exception to that
because a slogan you do spend a lot of
time on it
the problem is on a sentence that's a
throwaway sentence the no gets
disappeared
but if it's a slogan people really do
spend time thinking about that and then
and then all of the words will register
robert barnes says the deal's been made
the deal for who
did you think it was desantis
i think i'm hearing the rumor that
there's a desantis trump deal coming and
i'm gonna i'm gonna predict against it
here's the reason for predicting against
it
you don't
you don't put
somebody that strong in the vice
president chair
you just don't do that
that that would be basically
handicapping desantis it would be
smarter to let him run for his own
office
you know in 2028.
so i don't see the republicans making
what i would consider a mistake
even though
the two of them would win
if you're saying to me is that a strong
package and would they win
yes
and having desantis there would make me
much happier about a president at that
age oh you know how he could you know
how they could win me over on that i
mean it wouldn't be hard
here here's what you say
you know there is a there is an issue
with it having a president of a certain
age
and that's why my vice president is
going to be unusually strong
now i believe that biden tried to sell
us on that
but he tried to sell us on kamala harris
and nobody was buying that she was the
strong choice to make up for him
but but republicans would definitely buy
that desantis is a strong backup
just in case
you would definitely buy that
and i would also accept the possibility
that trump would leave office before his
fourth year of a second term
do you know why
because he might think he needs to
and it would be one of the most awesome
george washington things that ever
happened
because if if trump left his office
early in the second term
then everything that you believe he did
about trying to hold power for the first
term
would dissolve in your head it would
just dissolve
if he became most famous for the person
who walked away from power
let's say second or third year of a
presidency
then he becomes george washington
because he walked away from power
but if you don't do that then the
january 6th thing wants you forever
behind the scenes trump threatens to run
if garland decides not
i don't know what that means
wouldn't it link to nixon
candidates should not come from the same
state
yeah
is that a law
is it a law that a candidate can't come
from the same state or is that just a
standard
if it's not a law it doesn't matter
constitution
are you saying the constitution says you
can't be from the same state
that doesn't make sense
i don't believe that do you believe that
barnes cleared that up they can
oh uh i guess trump would only have to
register to vote in another state
okay so that wouldn't be so hard so i
guess the constitution bans it but it
wouldn't be hard to get a work around
that makes sense
i'm going to bet against desantis for
vice president
but it would be a ball or play if if
trump wants to sell desantis as his
worthy backup
i don't know might work
might work
i was quoted on uh gutfeld yes i saw
that
all right enough for now
i'll see you later youtube
