good morning everybody
and welcome
to the golden age
the highlight of civilization it begins
here we're going to recognize it here
and
will it into existence
yes are you tired of all the negativity
all the fighting on other
on other outlets well today
it's going to be all unicorns and
rainbows and
whatever else you like
because the golden age is coming
and it doesn't come by itself we've
gotta pull it a little bit give a little
yank that's what's gonna happen today
and if you'd like to
enjoy
the feeling of going to another level of
awareness and realizing the golden age
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tank your cells to stand a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind boom did it right that time
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
go
oh my god
oh my god
wait wait
i don't think i can resist a double sip
oh
god did i need that
well
let's talk about paul pelosi's
dui
you know
nancy pelosi's husband got stopped for a
dui recently and today we learned that
he allegedly
and i guess we should highlight
allegedly
because this does sound a little bit
too on the nose
i have to admit it doesn't sound true
but i'm going to tell you what is
allegedly reported
that he handed officers his driver's
license and
an 1199 foundation card
which is a group that supports highway
patrol
and provides scholarships for their
children
now
here's the thing
here's the thing
if if one of you
you know some unfamous
less rich person
had tried this
this approach
i would have said ah worth a try
worth a try right if it's a normal
person i'd say yeah whatever
everybody's got an angle yeah it's worth
a try
but when somebody of
nancy pelosi's husband's prominence
if this is true
it just makes you want to slap him
doesn't it
now regardless of whether this trick
works and i assume it doesn't because he
got arrested right so it looks like it
doesn't work
but
if it's true you just want to slap him
am i right there's just something about
the combination of who it was
plus the technique
see that that technique should be the
thing that's used by people who are not
powerful
i i guess here's the thing that bothers
me
people who are not powerful have a set
of strategies
and then people who are powerful have a
different set of strategies
and if he had to use a strategy that
typically you'd associate with the less
powerful people
i don't know
it just feels feels like you he's taken
something away
i i don't know what it is about it
there's just something about the story
that goes
now apparently there's some kind of drug
that was discovered in him as well who
knows who knows what that is
maybe we'll find out maybe we won't but
remember everything you hear about this
situation is a legend
a legend he has not been proven guilty
in a court of law
and
that has to mean something in our united
states
has to mean something
all right
how would you like to see critical race
theory
and things related to it destroyed
in the classroom
well i'm pretty close
yeah you don't see it coming yet
because there's there's no signs of it
yet
pretty close
it goes like this
what would be the opposite of critical
race theory because that's kind of
missing isn't it
have you noticed what's missing
if you say hey i don't like this
critical race theory
the alternative is just to be silent
that doesn't feel like enough does it
so if you're noticing hey why do we keep
you know it feels like we should be
fighting against this thing if you're
against critical race theory
you're fighting against him it feels
like
you're not winning
it's because you don't have any tools
you don't have anything to fight with
you're basically saying
basically somebody's shooting you in the
head and you're saying i wish that
weren't happening i sure i sure wish you
weren't shooting me in the head
how often does that work
it doesn't you have to have something to
fight back with now some people are
threatening lawsuits and you know that's
that's all good if it works
but
uh maybe you didn't see this coming
but there actually is a
solution there is a solution
it's strategy
the solution to crt
which
uh conservatives would
characterize it now this is of course a
right leaving characterization
everybody's got a narrative right so it
doesn't mean it's true
but the way it's the way it's portrayed
is that it's a victim mentality
if you don't like the victim mentality
you better have something better
just saying i don't like the victim the
victimhood that crt sort of implies
that doesn't buy you anything
you got to tell you got to tell us
what's better
what would be better
strategy
strategy would be better it's a high
ground
all right victimhood is low ground
strategy is the high ground and the
strategy is how do you use your
victimhood in the best possible way
all right now the worst possible way is
just complain and say give us stuff
because we're victims that's the worst
way it might work i'm not saying it
doesn't work it works a lot but it's
still the worst way
the the best way is to have a strategy
for success and just make your
strategies for success work
because if you're succeeding
you're basically fixing the current
generation and the ones after that as
well
so how could you possibly fix it well
what if what if there were a book
that taught you how to succeed
no matter how much of a victim you might
be
wouldn't that be useful
and suppose that book had been written
for somebody 14 years and up
so that they get could get it at about
the time that they're developing a
little bit of critical thinking
if only such a book existed
it's called had failed almost everything
and still win big and i wrote it
in part for exactly this
now more specifically i was sort of
thinking of my own
step kids as i wrote it
but it was written for the purpose
of battling this exact thing before it
had a name you know we always thought
about people
expressing their victimhood as their
primary
let's say philosophy or or operating
system of life
and
before i had a any kind of a name there
was that book
that said
how about a strategy instead of a
complaint
and the problem is that that book sort
of exists outside the
you know the educational system
but as of yesterday i did
offer
and i think it's been accepted i haven't
checked yet
for somebody who's a professional who
makes curriculums and lesson plans out
of books
so my book can now be turned into i'm
working into it into a lesson plan
and i'm not telling you that my book
needs to be the one
i can think of maybe
there might be five to ten books that
just jump out as something that
even a teenager should be exposed to
maybe in summary form
perhaps in summary form but definitely
the material right should be made
available to kids
and if you could make homeschoolers
learn strategies for success
while
the rest of the world is learning to
just read and write and complain
you fixed everything
because the market competition will take
care of the rest
so right now you've got a situation
where you've got public schools not
doing so great
and then you've got homeschoolers that
we don't understand
if if you're involved in homeschool you
probably do understand it but do you
understand
that people not directly involved in
home school don't exactly know what it
is
because it feels like mom has to stay
home and be the teacher and she doesn't
know how to do that
i mean that's that would be like the you
know the sexist way to look at it
but
but don't you think that home school
needs like more of a marketing kick
suppose i said to you public school is
where you learn to read write and
complain
and home school is where you learn to
read write and strategize or have a
strategy for success
am i done
that's it
that's the end of critical race theory
you just need to offer an alternative
and it hasn't been offered but the
alternative exists in the sense that all
the pieces are there you just have to
package it up and put it in a narrative
which i'm doing for you right now
all right let me say it again public
school is where you you learn to read
write and complain
about your victimhood about anything
you know your gender who knows whatever
complain
home school is where you learn to read
write and have a strategy for life
success
it's over
it's over
you you can't
that contrast
is first of all something that everybody
would get right away
but not until you can prove it
right right now home school is not that
home school is not that homeschool is
just another place to learn to read and
write with less complaining
but there's a real big difference
between less complaining and an active
strategy for success
that has been tried and works for
countless people all over the place
right there's you can't compare those
two things
so the title of the book is called it
had to fail at almost everything and
still went big you see the cover of it
over my shoulder there it's been out for
a number of years and and the reason
that
it's getting more attention now
than it did when it first came out it
was very successful when it first came
out
but it continues to grow in
i would say importance
because so far nobody has reproduced
something that is so directly
so directly gives you advice from
teenager up on how to organize a life
based on just plain obvious statistical
truths you know nothing that's nothing
that's out there
so anyway in the in a few weeks i will
probably have a curriculum and class
plan i'll make that available to
homeschools and i don't think that
necessarily my book needs to be the
thing that solves everything
but it's the narrative
if the one thing i can do is consolidate
the narrative around home school is
reading and writing
and strategy
you you tell me that you give that
choice to a black single parent
you say i'll give you a choice
you can go read write and complain or
you can go read write and have a
strategy for success that's so well
proven
it's almost guaranteed if you don't
become an addict
right
every parent is going to say yes to that
if they have the option right now they
don't have the option
yeah yeah i'll put the math in there
don't worry about it
you get the point
all right um
i'm going to tell you over and over
again until it becomes true
that we're seeing advanced signals of
the golden age approaching
and they're a little bit invisible
until i call them out
now one is a little bit more visible so
that's what reminded me
but i'd like to congratulate jon stewart
and all the people who worked on this
burn pit
packed bill that the major health care
legislation for
veterans now i don't know the details of
the bill
but i know that republicans and
democrats voted for it so i'm guessing
they did something right i still don't
understand what took so long i'm a
little i'm a little confused maybe it
was lack you know maybe it was incorrect
information
something maybe it was a strategy i
don't know
i'm a little bit confused about why it
did work didn't work and now it works
i i missed a little bit in in between
but it doesn't matter
so here's the thing i'd like to call out
can we
can we
the the audience that's watching this
mostly
um
you know mostly right-leaning people i
suspect
can you give jon stewart and
uh a completely
butt-free you know bots
congratulations and thank you
can you do that
can we without any reservations just say
that was good
yeah right
and that's what the golden age looks
like
now
how many of these examples are there
how many examples are there some some
people say no
really
so here's what i think i think the
democrat the democrats or the
republicans who voted for the bill
must have been satisfied that it was
clean enough
right
i believe that your information about it
being a dirty bill with pork in it
turned out to be not as true as you
think
i i think maybe that wasn't quite
accurate information
i think that there was some stuff that
wasn't maybe on point
but still good for veterans and health
care
i feel like that's what was happening
something like that but that's
speculation
the fact is it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter if both the democrats
and republicans voted for it
that's good enough for me
for now
have i read it would it make a
difference
if i read it would it make a difference
no
keep in mind the scott doesn't do read
or do research you're correct you know
one of the things that i try to do for
you
is to take your point of view
in some situations and this is one of
them
in other words as a consumer of the news
i'm i'm also criticizing the news
sources because i haven't seen the news
source that told me what's happening
have you
have you seen a right-leaning or
left-leaning news source that accurately
told you what was in the bill
i haven't even seen one try
i i've read all the headlines
every day left and right i i make sure i
look left and right
i'm i've not seen anybody even say what
was in the bill
so
you know i feel like that's the most
important thing to call out is that
we're not told what's in the bill and i
believe there should be a law that says
you should have uh those bills labeled
so the public can understand them but
anyway i'm going to congratulate
jon stewart because i think he was on
the side of good and he got what he
wanted and the veterans got what they
wanted and
maybe it's the golden age
maybe it is
well
uh so yesterday i think it was i asked
this provocative question
what is wrong with stephen king
how is it that he can write all these
best-selling books
and yet when he tweets he looks like a
 now it could be
the problems on my end
i can't rule that out so one of the
possibilities is it's just me but i know
a lot of you see it too
and
if you have the same cognitive
dissonance or confirmation bias i do
well maybe you see it the same way but
to me it looked like there's there was a
huge disconnect
between the way he tweets
and the quality of the commercial
products he's creating
now i don't have this feeling about
everybody who disagrees with me
right
just taking the prior point if jon
stewart disagreed with me on something i
don't know if he does but if he just if
he did
i would say well there's a smart person
with a smart background
saying things that i disagree with but
it's not because he's dumb or drunk or
something right
like you never say to yourself huh
jon stewart must be drunk today
at least it always sounds smart even if
you disagree with it but stephen king's
different he doesn't sound smart when he
disagrees with me it sounds like there's
something wrong
and so i
i asked
joshua lysek for an opinion and i
retweeted his thread in which he goes
into some detail and i would recommend
it to you
on the following basis
you could make an entire college class
around
joshua lysex tweet thread
there's so much in there
there's so much technique
uh put into the thread
that you should you should read it for
the technique
um even
well even more than i think the the
topic the topic is really interesting
but the technique he
he puts into it is
is uh that's just a lesson
and what what you're seeing in
particular from joshua i like to call
this out whenever i see it is somebody
who has intentionally built a talent
stack
which is a set of talents that work well
together
so he's a
ghost writer for a number of people
so the first thing he gets for free
is the ghost writes for people who are
on opposite sides of things
so he actually has the experience of
writing
arguments that are opposite of each
other do you know what that does for
your brain
good stuff
right if all you did is say i'm going to
be a ghost writer for people on the
political left or the political right
you would talk yourself into their point
of view by writing it over and over that
that's scientifically
demonstrated in studies by the way if if
somebody is asked to just write down an
opinion
physically write it that is not their
own opinion they can actually talk
themselves into the opposite of their
opinion
just by the process of writing down the
other opinion
it's a thing
now you could argue that like most
studies they're not reproducible
but i choose to believe that's probably
true because it agrees with
everything i know about brains
but joshua takes business on both sides
and so he gets to see both sides of
a pretty big topics
that's a talent
he's also demonstrates probably the best
marketing i've ever seen on twitter i've
never seen anybody market better on
twitter
case in point the very thread i'm
talking about
gets you all hooked on the you know the
topic but then he embeds a little
advertisement
later down in the thread
when you can easily accept it
because he's created enough value for
you that when you get to something
that's clearly a little promotional bit
you're like ah okay i actually am
interested in that because everything
else was so good oh good to know that
he's got a product too
and then of course he's learned
persuasion hypnosis i think you can see
reciprocity built in that's a persuasion
technique so for example he mentioned
something good about me
in the thread
what's that going to do
well first of all it's going to make me
retweet it
if i hadn't already liked the content
yeah i was going to retweet it anyway
but that would have been a little extra
kicker so you can see all the techniques
of persuasion in it you can see all the
writing technique which is you know
just the top level commercial quality
you could ever see marketing 100
uh and it's just a strong package so you
should read it for that that reason
i'll give you uh just a preview
he starts with three theories about why
stephen king could be tweeting so
differently than the quality of work
suggests
one would be substance abuse that's in
the public domain we know that he was a
long-term
substance abuser stephen king was we
know he had
a serious accident that presumably
caused some head trauma
does that make you the same when you're
done
we don't know
but it's certainly an open question
and but the more interesting part which
he develops is the fiction writers have
overactive imaginations
and if you write fiction
and the in the first chapter i think
this is the example that joshua uses if
there's a if there's a rifle hanging
over the fireplace in the first chapter
it's going to be important later on
because that's how fiction is written
but in the real world
you see all of these things that don't
mean anything
and they never will mean anything
they're just coincidences and all the
coincidences could be interpreted by a
fiction writer
who has wired their brain to think
everything matters
it's just an automatic thing if you're
if you're in that mode everything
matters every every piece of evidence
you know will will will have a role
later on in the book and then you look
at the real world
and you see all this stuff that really
doesn't mean anything and suddenly your
confirmation bias just kicks in so yeah
this means something oh yeah i'm picking
up the hints oh a lot of people don't
see this but i'm seeing that gun over
the fireplace of the first chapter
it's an interesting theory
and it's based on the fact that whatever
you're doing often is however you is the
way you wire your brain
if you have a brain that's looking at uh
is is looking for your victimhood
what do you do to your brain
hey today i think i'll go out and look
for some victimhood of myself
and then tomorrow i'm going to go out
and look for some victimhood and hey
there's some other people talking what's
their victimhood
you can talk yourself into that being
your operating system
meaning your your go-to reflexive way of
thinking even without trying it's
completely accidental
so we've got an entire education system
that doesn't understand
some of the most
basic things about how the human mind
works and how to program
not even the basics
i wonder if there are anybody else who
doesn't understand the basics of how
brains work
huh
i wonder if i might mention something
later on in my presentation
foreshadowing
foreshadowing
well arizona had some uh elections
uh with the primaries i guess yesterday
blake masters looks like he's the gonna
be the candidate on the republican side
for senate
he is a trump endorsed guy uh the last i
checked carrie lake was ahead but it's
getting close right isn't isn't the
is it pretty close now
uh oh the spelling for joshua's last
name is l l-i-s-e-c
pretty sure if you google that you'll
get his twitter account
so joshua lysek
i hope i'm pronouncing it right he never
told me i wasn't so i'll just go with
that all right so it does look like
trump is still the king maker
um
am i correctly reading the the news from
last night
uh am i correctly reading that trump
endorsed candidates had a good day
are we all agreeing with that
or is that something that the right the
left is not agreeing with yet
i think i think that looks to be the
narrative that everybody's sort of
settling on right
now
that's interesting isn't it
this uh disgraced politician trump
he's uh
somehow the most the most important
character
um and yet and yet
uh he's been out of office and should be
disgraced by now shouldn't he
i hear people saying kerry lake won but
le i checked the fox page just before i
got on
and it looked like it was narrowing
so i don't know
um
so let's talk about the january 6
hearings backfiring i tweeted this and
i'm going to give you a lesson on how to
make a viral tweet
so i'm going to talk about my tweet
and then i'm going to tell you that as i
created it i said oh here's a viral
tweet
let me
let me check on it let me let me check
to see if it actually
went viral
um
i'll bet it did are you checking out
so you're checking on it yourself
all right let's see how many this is
only about there a little bit and it's
already got over 300 retweets generally
300 retweets this quickly would suggest
is heading to over a thousand
which would be viral in in my world a
thousand retweets would be i would
consider that a viral tweet
uh viral you know not within the world
so much as within maybe my universe
all right
um
here's first of all we'll talk about the
content of the tweet but then secondly
i'll talk about what made it viral okay
so here's five things no democrat wanted
yet the january six hearings delivered
so it's what they didn't want but they
got number one it kept trump the most
relevant figure in politics
is that what they wanted
don't feed the energy monster
if there's one thing
one thing you have to get right
here let me give you a visual for this
imagine there's a
there's a monster from space that's
behind it
it's behind a cage
and there's a big sign on it that says
energy monster
and then below that it says do not feed
energy to the energy monster
it's the only thing you can't do
no matter why you do
don't give it energy
and so they gave it energy
how'd that work out
exactly the way you'd imagine
it worked out exactly the way you think
it would he became the most important
person in politics
when he should have been heading in the
other direction
if they had completely shut him out
and ignored the entire january sixth
thing completely
he might have been less important
but instead
they made us think this is number two in
my tweet number two made us think about
election rigging until it seemed true
if there's one thing i can teach you
about persuasion it's this
don't think about an elephant
stop it no stop thinking about the
elephant because there's no elephants
there's no elephants no there's no
elephants stop it stop thinking about
elephants
the most basic mistake in persuasion
is to tell you to stop thinking about
something because it's making you think
about it right
that's what they did
they made you think about election uh
election rigging until more people were
convinced it was true
they actually talked people into trump's
point of view by just talking about
election ringing over and over and over
again even saying it wasn't true
didn't help basic rule of persuasion
number three
by showing people who looked like
republicans being hunted and jailed and
demonized
for things that other republicans we now
know republicans generally believed as
did the people were protesting that they
were trying to save the republic and so
the january 6 hearings made the people
who believed they were trying to save
the republic looked like they were being
rounded up and jailed they made all
republicans feel hunted
possibly
possibly
the biggest mistake in politics of all
time
you know history might record this as
just the biggest gaff
you i don't know if you could ever top
this one
but uh
fourth
because nothing is really coming of it
and
it looks like congress looks more
useless than usual how would you like to
be in charge of congress
and the thing that's getting the most
attention for congress is the thing that
is the least useful
the hearings
it's the least useful thing they could
be doing and also getting the most
attention now lately some of the other
bills have gotten attention that's much
better for them
all right number five
they debunked their own narrative
basically they cleared the way for trump
to return to power and i don't know if
that could have happened without them
in my opinion
in my opinion the zeitgeist will soon
change on both the left and the right to
realizing that the hearings guaranteed
trump's return to power because they
didn't find anything that would damn him
and put him in jail
and so it cleared him
how many republicans thought to
themselves you know
i supported trump but once they dig into
this they're going to find some bad
stuff and i'm going to hold back
and then they dug in
and they didn't find any bad stuff in
fact only the only thing they found
is a harvard study that says that the
protesters believed they were there to
help the to
fix a problem not create one they
thought they were saving the republic
and now that's in evidence
this could not have been better for
trump
every part of this worked for trump
every part of it
um
all right
so it's already up to 350
retweets
re retweets
you know as i'm reading it the retreats
are climbing
1300 hearts all right so what made this
viral yesterday i was asked on the live
stream
uh i think yesterday how to write a
viral tweet
here's how to do it
now there's not it's not like there's a
formula
that if you follow the formula it's
always viral
but if you don't use these elements you
probably couldn't get there
and
uh
the elements
are number one
is it something everybody's thinking
about and already has energy
so your viral tweet should start with
energy that already exists that's rule
number one
it's very hard to make something that
nobody's thinking about
turned viral
unless
they were all sort of thinking about it
but nobody said it yet that's your best
situation
if everybody's thinking about it and
everybody has emotion about it but
nobody's really
put in words yet that's the perfect
situation
if everybody's thinking about it but
also everybody is already putting in
words
then you're just one more tweet the same
the same thing as everybody else so you
need to be you need to stand out so you
need to be different that's important
but you need to be different in a way
that agrees with what people's energy
and enthusiasm is already you know
prepared for
so certainly
people are looking at january 6 this is
on people's minds so it had a high level
of energy so i got that right all right
so so number one i i caught the energy
and the relevance correctly
next i did a list
uh lists tend to be a little bit more
viral
because they're they're really easy to
consume
people don't like paragraphs and then
they can also pick out uh one of the
elements and say oh i like that one
and i'll use this if you can give people
something they can use themselves
it becomes a little tool they can use
themselves for their own arguments then
it's viral because they want to they
want to spread their own arguments so
here i've given five different
i think compelling reasons
uh so people could pick any one of the
five and say i like that one so i'm
going to retweet this
next i did not i did not put any curse
words in this
do you see how often i put curse words
in tweets
a curse word
even a little bit of naughtiness
will remove 75 percent of the energy
from a tweet
about 75
in other words it's really hard to make
a viral tweet with a curse word in it
unless
the public is also so mad
that they will tweet a curse word
it's very unusual so you have you have
to look for like really special cases
now
it might sound like i'm contradicting
myself because i'm teaching you how to
be viral and also saying that i often
tweet things that are not couldn't be
viral
right if i put the f word in a tweet
it's not going anywhere
unless it's a real special case
why do i do it
why do i put the f word in tweets and
when i know it will suppress their their
tweet
and the reason is
because it's how i really feel
sometimes i tweet for a fact
and sometimes i tweet because that's
just what i feel and twitter is also a
place you can say how you feel
so if i say how i feel i don't
necessarily need you to retweet it
like that's not the game
sometimes i just need to get it off my
chest
so i'll put enough word there because
that's how i feel
i'd rather be genuine and you know give
up a few retweets in those cases all
right what else makes this um
um so viral
uh it's it's gonna be probably 400
retweets before i'm done talking about
it
um one is that each of the points is
easy you know it's just a simple
declarative sentence
and that's all basically i took away any
reason not to retweet it i gave you lots
of reasons to retweet it i connected it
to something that's in the headlines and
i have a provocative point
being provocative is important
and it's also useful
if it looks like it puts you in danger
the best thing you can do to make
something viral and i'm not sure i can
recommend it
i'm telling you what works i'm not
recommending it because i would never
recommend you get yourself in trouble
but
if your tweet looks like somebody
is going to have a bad day because of it
or somebody might get in trouble
or somebody's in danger
danger really makes things viral
and the danger in this case is to
me
you can feel my danger in this tweet can
you not
because look look what happened to my
career just saying good things about
trump and here i'm not even really i
mean trump is barely the subject of this
because it's really more about january 6
making gigantic persuasion mistakes
he just happens to be the topic
but every time i associate myself with
trump
i put myself in danger
do you feel that by the way
does that you probably feel it for
yourself but if you're a public figure
and you say anything that's pro-trump
even indirectly this is pretty indirect
right you feel my danger
when when people project danger and it's
real
you know they have to believe it's real
i guess
but if it's real
that makes you
it's a little higher energy situation
and energy is what makes you retweet
stuff
all right um i think you have most of
the
points and and i think that putting
these five things together creates a
full narrative which i think makes us
strong as well if i had made only one of
these five points in a tweet you might
have said to yourself oh that's one good
point
there's one good point i agree with
might not retweet it but if i put five
points
in the same tweet
you say to yourself that's a whole
narrative
that's like a whole zeitgeist explains
in five points so that ladies and
gentlemen is
what makes a tweet viral
you're welcome
all right
how many people do you think
believe that the u.s economy is in a
recession
and what percentage of the country would
you think
uh thinks we're not in a recession just
take a guess
you don't have to be a professional
pollster just take a guess how many
people what percentage
how did you do that
what
how are you all guessing correctly how
are you doing this
you're not professional pollsters
how how
how are you doing it
yes according to rasmussen
62 percent of likely u.s voters believe
the u.s economy is in the recession but
23 percent think it's not
and you're guessing 25 that rounds
rounds up
how did you do that
i think rasmussen may be replaced by
your tweets
because do we need rasmussen to do this
anymore you already knew the answer
before they even did the poll how
how how did you do that
oh we know how
25 of the public will get
every question wrong
[Laughter]
now that's not every time you know i i
say it as an absolute because it's more
provocative that way it's not absolute
but the number of times you see it
try to unsee it
right try to unsee the 25 for the rest
of your life
sorry
i just changed your brain for the rest
of your life
you will never not be able to see that
here's another theme i keep telling you
is predictive
is it's a sub theme of fall of the money
remember follow the money is your best
guide to what is true even when it
doesn't make sense why it would be
it works
and the corollary to that is that the
insurance industry is the only one who's
going to tell you the truth
which is weird because there are not
many entities that i trust less than
insurance companies but there's one
thing i do trust
they like to make money
they do they like to make money and so
they are really really serious about
getting the risks and data correct
and they have something that you don't
have
their internal data
so they can look at their internal data
and match it to whatever the cdc or the
government is saying and they can say
huh
something wrong with that cdc data and
then they can make a wiser decision
because they're going to have two
choices you might have only one
so if you see the insurance
insurance industry
start to move in one direction as a
whole i wouldn't i wouldn't necessarily
listen to one insurance company but if
you see the entire industry say uh-huh
we're going this way because that's
where the risk was sorry i'm sorry
popular narrative but we're here to make
money we're not here to
support the narrative and unfortunately
our data is moving the narrative over
here sorry about that
and we're seeing the beginning of what
that might look like
i'm going to call on herd
mentality for insurance companies
herd mentality is very much a thing
right so herd mentality very much
affects things
in my opinion
in my opinion
insurance companies are as close to
immune to that as you could be
because if you're the actuarial you need
to get it right
you need to get it right your money
depends on it and i think that you would
become very unwoke the moment your bonus
directly depends on getting it right
now if one insurance company gets it
wrong
i might say
there's somebody who's too woke
but if the entire group of them if all
of the insurance companies as a group
start moving in the same direction
i'm going to listen to that
because let's follow the money business
and the question that they're working on
is the excess deaths
and uh whether it's you know i suppose
one part of the country thinks it's
because
people are unvaccinated another country
another part of the country thinks the
excess deaths are being because they're
vaccinated
i will not get into that debate today
i'll just say that the insurance company
is going to settle that question for you
they have not done that
they have not yet done it
but i guarantee you
the insurance industry is going to
settle this question
maybe in a year maybe in two years but
they will settle this question i'm
pretty sure
i'm confident they can do that as a
whole
all right now i'd like to totally screw
up a narrative that you've been enjoying
for a long time
has to do with george soros and i
finally figured out a narrative that
explains all the observations
my problem with the soros
criticisms is that it didn't match
all the the data that i could see that
was you know right available to
everybody did not match the narrative
and i was looking for some kind of
explanation
that would make sense for why uh soros
is in fact so this is part that i'm i'm
now on board with
it it is in fact true
that soros is giving money to groups
that let's say are
uh getting your liberal prosecutors in
office and creating more crime and all
kinds of problems
and when soros was asked about that he
didn't have a coherent answer
and that was my first flag that said
wait a minute
he doesn't even have a coherent answer
because the worst person in the world
has a reason
am i wrong
if you talk to adolf hitler
he had a reason
he could at least explain it it was a
terrible reason
but he can explain it
soros can't even explain it
what does that tell you
i'm going to eliminate evil genius from
the options that i'm considering
i don't think evil genius is what's
going on
the other explanations of he wants power
here's here's my um personal take on
that
people who are that rich
that rich
and that old
are not looking for power
that's a dumb narrative
i i would uh i would uh
let's say
imagine yourself i'll do i'll do this in
terms of allowing you to imagine it
imagine you have so many billions that
you'll never lose them and you can do
anything you want
money is no longer any object to you you
have all the money you want so much
money that you're trying to give it away
as fast as you can
you have only a few years to live
few years to live and you know it
do you think that george soros with a
few years to live is looking for
personal power
i would call that
a really low low likelihood
i think what he cares about is the
world he leaves to his children
i think the most real realistic
assumption remember we can't read his
mind
so everything i say about what he's
thinking is speculation just like you
right if you think you know what he's
thinking or what his motives are that's
speculation
everything i say is also equal to that
so so would you agree with me first of
all that anything i say about what his
motives might be i can't know
i'm speculating so i'm saying that all
of our speculation should be treated as
equal would you would you give me that
would you give me that we can't know
what he's thinking
so that all of our speculations start
out being equally
sketchy
the only thing i'm going to offer you is
that the explanation i'm going to fill
out here when i'm done
will fill will fit all of the data
and that all of the other narratives
don't fit the data that's all i'm going
to say i'm not saying that's what he's
really thinking
and this is an important point if i told
you i knew what he's thinking that would
be crazy and that would be bad
form
but if i tell you there's one
explanation that fits what we observe
and all the rest do not i think that
that moves the ball so that's what i'm
doing
here's my
uh hypothesis you ready for this
the only thing that fits all the data
is that whoever it is who makes the the
the detailed uh recommendations of where
his money goes
it's not thesaurus himself
soros is not investigating organizations
and looking at grants
he's just sort of you know blessing him
when they happen the only explanation
that makes sense
is that whoever is doing the grants is
getting a kickback
from the organizations that are they're
funding
do you know what do you know why that
fits all the data because it would give
you a reason
why soros is funding so many
disreputable groups
because what kind of a group could give
you a kickback
now what i mean by kickback is this if
you imagine the soros owns the money
but he's he's authorized some group to
decide how to distribute it
the group that decides how to distribute
it could either do it honestly and just
get their paycheck
or they could look for groups that will
give them money back personally like a
bribe
and they'll say if you give us 10
million dollars of soros's money
we'll make sure that an entity that
you're involved with
will somehow coincidentally get a
million dollar contract that they
wouldn't have gotten otherwise
you see how easy this is
if you're the if you're the group in
charge of who gets the money
you would go for the ones that are the
lead the most sketchy the most corrupt
you would intentionally seek out the
most corrupt people to give the money to
not all of it
not all of it because you want to cover
your tracks by giving money to some
groups that are unambiguously good
so you'd have you know let's say 30
groups or whatever you know 28 of them
are unambiguously good
but you find a few sketchy ones that'll
give you a million dollars back in ways
that can't be traced
right
would soros himself be aware of that
no he would not because he's not on the
ball
the one thing i can tell you for sure is
he's not quite all there yet in the way
he used to be i don't know how smart he
used to be
i imagine he was quite brilliant i think
that's what we all understand but he
doesn't look at at the moment
and to me it looks like anybody could
tell him anything and he'd probably
believe it
because he's that old
so if the people giving out the money
would say to him hey
people are saying that that uh
you know we're just creating more crime
by getting all these prosecutors
their jobs
what do you think what do you think
those people tell soros
i think those people tell soros it isn't
so bad
or it's temporary or mostly it works but
yeah in this one case it didn't
don't you think he's getting a
completely different story
about how bad it is and if he looked at
the headlines the headlines
on the people he doesn't trust
if you're george soros most of the news
about you is fake
in my opinion
in my opinion most of the news about
soros is fake so he probably doesn't
even look at the news to get any
information because it's all fake
who is he going to trust well the people
he hired
the people he hired are gonna say
everything's fine don't believe the news
you know we're giving it to really good
organizations we checked them really
carefully we audit them every day don't
worry about it we got this under control
that's just it's just the fake news it's
just fox news it's just rumors on the
internet
so
here is my proposition
my explanation which i can't confirm in
any way is just an allegation
my explanation fits all the data
because the part i did not understand is
why soros could not explain why he's
doing something clearly bad let's say
the prosecutors who are letting people
out of jail and making crime spike
there's no way he's in favor of that no
way he's in favor of that
he either doesn't understand it doesn't
know what's happening
somebody's you know gaslighting him
locally something like that
the
if you tell me he's in it for the power
you have to explain to me why there are
zero
uh 90 plus year old billionaires
fighting for power while giving away
most of their fortune at the same time
that's the bill gates problem if you
think bill gates is fighting for power
while giving away most of his fortune
i just don't see it it just doesn't look
even logical to me
and part of that is because my
perspective is as someone who used to
have not have money
and then was lucky enough to get
relatively rich not as rich as those
guys you know nowhere near it but but i
know what it's like to get rich
and i and i know that it doesn't make
you
it doesn't make you evil
you know if you're evil when you started
maybe
but
it does make you want to do things for
the rest of the world
i actually think that bolsoros and bill
gates
are completely interested in what's best
for the world
but also would be good for them wouldn't
it
but i don't think they're they're in it
for the money
and i don't think if they're in it for
the power i think they're in it for the
the credit
that you get when you make the world a
better place
has anybody figured out what i'm in it
for
what do you think i'm in it for
like i spend all this time preparing and
doing work in public it costs me a great
deal of money what do you think i'm in
it for
yeah i would love for people to say you
didn't you did a good job scott
good job you helped the public
yeah
now somebody's saying is for ego
maybe
here's how i here's how i internally
understand it
i believe that once you've taken care of
your own needs
you naturally take care of your family
the people closest
once you've taken care of yourself and
your family
and you still have stuff left over
i believe there's an instinct
to help the larger group the tribe
so what you say is ego i say is instinct
and i think that gates and soros are
also working on instinct
but it looks exactly like ego to you
here's why
i say that
because i've experienced it
and if there's anybody here who's
experienced getting rich when they
didn't start that way
ask
ask yourself
uh did you help other people if he did
because of ego
or because of
instinct it feels like instinct
because i could tell you i had a very
like profound experience when i had more
money than i needed like because it
happened kind of instantly it was like
winning a lottery because for me it was
a very big check from a publisher early
in my career where i said this check is
so big
i might not have to work again if i
don't want to
and in that moment i lost all of my
incentive
that i had always had all my life
because everything i'd done up to the
point was to make myself successful
and then i i succeeded
and then what the hell do you do
what do you do if your life
your life mission to become successful
what happens if it works
if it works suddenly i i had this
like transformation
my brain just went from oh
you took care of yourself and now you
can take care of your family easily
how about the tribe how about other
people so so you can see the arc of my
career followed that pattern and i'm way
less rich than these those other guys
like way less not even close
so i i think it's instinct
you say it's gratitude i don't think so
i think it's instinct
so that's my take so i'm gonna so here's
the full model and you compare it to
yours there's either these people who
got super rich and still want power even
though they have practically unlimited
power for anything they want right bill
gates can make pretty much anything
happen
right does he need more power i don't
know
i think it's people working on instinct
and in the soros case i think he's
poorly
maybe poorly served by somebody
down the line
i
now let me let me test you
let me test you
does my assumption and this is just an
assumption it's not an allegation
just an assumption
it was speculation i'll weaken it from
assumption assumption is even higher
than speculation i'm going to take it
all the way down to speculation
so all of our speculations are evil
because or not evil equal maybe maybe
they're evil all of our speculations
about what soros is thinking are equal
because we can't read his mind
only we can only see what he does
and i would i would put my
uh my fortunes i would bet them on their
because there's corruption below him
and that explains everything
what do you think
did i sell it
disagree wholeheartedly i see people say
i see no way off
i saw some people say yes
now i would argue that those of you who
have been so deeply in the soros is evil
camp are unable to hear what i'm saying
those of you who didn't really have a
strong opinion one way or the other
probably heard my explanation and some
of them said oh that looks better than
the other explanation
i think if you can't make the leap
on this one
you have to
check your thinking
just step back i'm not even going to say
you're wrong because that part we don't
know right
so hear me carefully i'm not saying
you're wrong
do you get that
do you get really clearly that i'm not
saying you're wrong whatever your
interpretation is you could be totally
right totally right
it just doesn't fit the facts as well as
mine that's all
um
all right
uh here's uh an interesting thing um you
know i told you that uh ai especially
with the help of
machiavelli's underbelly
on twitter i've been testing whether ai
can write a dilbert comic strip and so
far it's uh it's shockingly close
but not there i made the mistake
somebody's telling me that i have a
strong opinion and that therefore i am
biased
that is correct that is correct
that's why
i tell you to check check my work the
same as you should check your own
but here's what you should look for
what what would be the source of my bias
if i had had a strong opinion
one way or the other before this started
then that would be
that would be a good speculation
but i think you can say that my bias
from the start is i just didn't
understand
would you agree
would you agree with my characterization
of my own public statements of soros
that from the beginning i've said i'm
just puzzled i just don't understand
if you approach a topic from i'm
confused
and then you form a point of view it's
less likely to be confirmation bias
do you get that
confirmation bias is when you're just
agreeing with what you already said oh
all the evidence supports what i already
said
that's not what i did it was literally
yesterday when i realized that
corruption could explain all the
elements so i didn't have anything like
a firm opinion and still don't that's
why i'm so so adamant about saying that
this is speculation
but so is yours
we're all on the same level of
credibility which is none basically
so back to humor so ai did a good job of
coming up with things that uh sounded
funny and i cleverly but incorrectly
suggested
that if ai were fed the six dimensions
of humor a formula that i came up with
years ago for what makes something funny
the formula is that if any of two of six
dimensions are used in a joke it's it
could be funny but not necessarily but
it's a minimum requirement the minimum
requirement
is two of six dimensions if you haven't
heard it the six dimensions are
is it recognizable you know something
that happens in your life is it naughty
cute clever bizarre
um
and there's uh
another one i forget but if you use two
of the six you get it so i said hey if
you were to feed this formula into a.i
could then it beat me
because i believed it had not been done
but it turns out that
machiavelli's underbelly had done
exactly that and fed my entire
explanation of the six dimensions of
humor into it it still did not create a
joke
that i think was
great it was missing one thing
but this is going to really this is
really going to blow your mind down
there's only one thing that it couldn't
do
you knew how to write
you knew what a joke was
you knew the formula for writing a joke
it had the right topic
but it didn't quite hit
there's one thing i say all the time
that it needs to have to write jokes
that's missing
a b testing
do you know how i know if something is
funny
i'm a b testing it in my own brain
because there's still one thing i can do
that ai can't do
well that's a lie it's one thing that ai
hasn't done yet
but could really easily do
that's the problem
the problem is
it can't a b test on its own
because it doesn't have a sense of humor
but a human has a sense of humor this
developed in whatever weird way we
develop
so when i'm going through all the
options i'm saying if he says this is a
funny if he says this is a bit funny he
says this
i actually laugh
i a b test instantly
if it makes me laugh that's the
requirement it has to make me laugh
the computer doesn't have that it'll put
on its best shot
it'll try one thing it's best shot and
then it's done
if i did that i couldn't write humor
either if all i did is
put put down my my first draft
you would never read my comic
it doesn't do the second drafts
it doesn't edit
and it doesn't test it with the audience
now here's what's going to put me out of
business
all you need is a twitter account that
the ai has access to
that it can tweet
and then you say
ai
write me a joke about um george soros or
critical race theory
and then the ai
gives a first draft
here's my first draft and then
it tweets it and says what do you think
about this
and then humans some way instantly
because jokes are
are easy to read might be three
sentences
within five minutes
the ai has hundreds of responses
it only needs ten 10 responses would be
perfectly adequate to say if something
is funny or not because people are
similar enough
that if three out of 10 thought it was
hilarious that would be a hit
right
you know you can't get 10 out of 10. but
if you got 3 out of 10 people say that
is just really funny you would have a
best-selling book number one comic 3 out
of 10 is huge for humor
so the only thing
ai doesn't do to write jokes
it could do tomorrow
it just had to know what i just told you
all it needs to do is add the one thing
that i have that it doesn't have and it
could do it better than i could do it
because if i could test all of my jokes
instantly
on twitter with other people
i wouldn't use my own brain to do it
because the limitation of my own brain
is that i'm only getting the things i
think are funny
and cartoonists become a little weird
over time
we need edgier stuff to laugh because we
deal with humor all the time so you just
need more
and so sometimes there are things i
don't think are funny that the audience
would
and some of the actually some of the
most popular dilbert comics of all time
i thought were some of my weaker efforts
but the public thought it was my best
work
so i can't tell
but hey i could tell ai would know what
the best one is because it would have
data it tested it
so you you add the first draft
a b testing second draft a b testing you
add that to the humor formula
and a i already can do my job
did you see the pictures the a.i drew of
my comic strip
and you noticed that the the heads of
the characters were like mishapen
how hard would it be to teach the ai hey
hey we we see your first draft of these
comics but we should remind you
that on humans as well as comics
the ears on both sides are symmetrical
the eyes are symmetrical
so you want symmetry the let whatever's
on the left should look like the right
believe it or not ai doesn't seem to
know that yet in the context of creating
you know dilbert comics but how hard
would it be for ai to learn
that the ear on the left needs to look
like the ear on the right or it's not
right
pretty easy
pretty easy
all right
that should scare you
you know a lot of us thought that art
would be last
the art would be the last thing that the
ai could do
and for probably 20 years i've been
saying
you are so wrong
art is going to be the first thing
art isn't going to be the last thing
it's going to be the first thing and the
reason that i can say that
is because of my talent stack
i do creative stuff for a living in a
lot of different realms you know visual
art and writing etc tweeting
speaking
so i have the you know the creative
experience down but my background is
more economics and rational business and
you know even engineering type of
thinking
so i bring sort of an engineering
approach into the creative world and
what i can see
what i can see is my own method
i can see my own system
i'm not sure other artists
see it as clearly if they don't have
sort of an engineering mindset going
into it
and so what i can see is that all art
is just
a formula
art is just a formula
and then you add the first draft and the
a b testing part of it and you're done
i knew that from this from the jump
i knew that art would be first and in my
opinion the art that the ai is doing
right now is better than human art
so let me call let me call it and by the
way
it doesn't matter what you say it
matters what artists say
this is one of those situations where it
takes an artist
to tell you when the ai is better
and i'm telling you that right now
i've seen a lot of ai art in the last
month it's better i if you told me what
do you want to put on your wall
i would put the air on my wall right now
it's not even close
in my opinion the ai art has already
lapped human art and it will never
return
it's over
you know people might buy human art
because it came from humans and you know
they're always going to see things they
like
but the ai art is just better it's just
better
calling it better is silly no it's not
no it's not better better in this
context means that it lights up
the parts of the brain the art is
supposed to light up
and it does does it more uh thoroughly
than other art that that's pretty
objective you know i know art is you
know it when you see it blah blah but
that's just not true
it's just not true
what's true is good
art is done well
is very objectively
done well and you could find the formula
to it you know how many of you know that
if you were to do a portrait
there's a let's say
a design element or several they pretty
much have to use if you go outside that
you know those design expectations
you don't have art
so art is always been formula it's just
that the artist didn't necessarily know
they were following one
and you thought it was maybe magic and
art because you didn't know the formula
either
but if you do create art
and you have some background and you
know rational thinking
you can see instantly that it's just
craft art is mostly craft plus luck
there's some people who make things and
it's just magic on the first draft
and that's just luck
you know if you tried to make artistic
things all day long and you had some
skill at it you're going to nail it once
in a while
it's just luck
you're not talking about the same art
that you're talking about
i think i am but i don't know
there's a priceless plexiglas box called
art well i think that's more about
marketing
than anything else
is luck really genius
well let me give you one of the reframes
that's in my
how to fail book
well that's weird
uh
about luck
the old frame is that you can't control
luck
the reframe the one that i offer is that
you can totally control luck
you just have to go where luck exists
so go where there's more energy more
things happening more connections more
networking more jobs faster growing
industry a growing industry not a
shrinking industry you just go where the
action is and then you know put yourself
into it and you're going to have all
kinds of opportunities but if you sit on
your couch at home
luck isn't going to find you a home
so
you would say that's not luck no it is
luck because you still need the
accidental
you know opportunity you still need to
notice when somebody said something
somebody named their couch lucky yeah
okay that's one way to play it
um jeff says you do realize the engineer
artist thing works both ways excellent
point
the the engineer science thing works
both ways too
yeah there is a hypothesis that i found
stronger than i thought it would be
that artists anticipate science and
therefore engineering
right
do you believe that do you believe that
art
anticipates
science
i'm going to go further
you can't make anything you can't
imagine
there's your reframe
you can't do anything you can't imagine
i've often been asked
you know uh have i ever been tempted to
do this or that illegal thing
to which i say well i can't imagine it
working out for me
so no
there's nothing that would cause me to
do something where i can't even imagine
it could work out
at the very least you have to imagine it
before it activates you you don't even
stand up
you don't even get off the couch
unless you can imagine that that
pays off if you can't even imagine it's
good to get off the couch you're not
going to do it
so your imagination is the only thing
that activates you plus um
dopamine
it's basically imagination
plus dopamine
plus a functioning body you know health
that's it
imagination plus preference i guess
imagination plus preferences you know
personal preferences
plus dopamine there you go
all right well some of you need to go
start your day
and that means it must be close to eight
o'clock
uh my time not your time and
may i say
that i had the most
excellent writing trip
i felt i was uh
totally totally
inspired
a apparently my muse did a good job
and
i'll see you tomorrow and youtube
bye for now
