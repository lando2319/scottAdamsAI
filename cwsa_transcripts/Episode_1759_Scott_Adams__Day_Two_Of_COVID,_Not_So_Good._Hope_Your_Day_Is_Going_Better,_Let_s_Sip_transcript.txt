oh
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization coffee
with scott adams
today will be the special covert uh
version
because i got myself a bad case of the
covet
day two of symptoms
and let me tell you it's really
unpleasant
really really unpleasant
but the biggest part about it which i'll
tell you later
is the brain fog so
uh i may have some trouble getting
through this
it's pretty bad
and all you need to take it up a level
is a copper mugger glass a tanker
chelsea stein a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopey of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous
go
all right i've got some confessions
confession time
i'm going to tell you something that was
too embarrassing to tell you yesterday
i'm going to tell you today
so i told you i tried to get some uh
that pax loved it was i guess it's the
pfizer pill
and uh i did not succeed
ultimately i decided to go without it
but i did try to get it and did not
succeed and do you know why i did not
succeed in getting it
anybody want to guess
why did i not succeed
in getting the pavloxin or whatever it
is
i had two in shape now well i don't
maybe
um here's the answer and here's the
embarrassing answer
too much brain fog
i actually couldn't figure out how to
receive a phone call
now let me say that again
i couldn't figure out how to receive a
phone call
and my
my medical
service kaiser
they have to call you back
so you can't call them they have to call
you back
i couldn't figure out how to receive a
call
now here's why i have my
phone
ringer turned off unless it's in my
contacts which i did a long time ago
and so i said to myself oh if i'm going
to get this call i better turn my
notifications back on
because i know i turned them off
so i went into my iphone
went to the part about notifications
went to the part about phone
notifications
and there was nothing there about
turning my ringer back on for contacts
before you before you go on
you want to jump in and tell me how to
do it right
i know how to do it
i just go to google and say how do i
turn my wringer back on
and it will tell me how to do it
i didn't know that yesterday
or to put it you know in a
more accurate way i kind of knew it i
couldn't execute it
i just couldn't do it
so i was actually
mentally incompetent
and trying to
navigate
a complicated situation that i hadn't
been in
now for things which i've you know
experienced before i'm fine right so i
know how to
do little stuff
but
yeah somebody says it sounds like
getting old
but here's the thing
if i didn't have the brain fog i just
would have googled it and changed my
phone and taken the call and gotten the
drug
it's not hard
there was nothing there was nothing to
it
but i didn't have anybody
at the moment i don't have any adults in
the house
and i didn't want to call somebody and
admit that i couldn't figure out how to
use my phone
i was so degraded like i just couldn't
get past it just couldn't figure it out
and ultimately i decided not to take the
drug anyway
because
how much testing went into that drug
here we all been talking about the
vaccinations you know wasn't tested
enough and stuff i thought well what
makes the pill any better
i don't know
why should i assume that that's safe
so if you
take the assumption that you're going to
be fine anyway maybe it takes an extra
day or two
i'm not sure it made sense to take the
pill unless you were in a
in a let's say a
worse situation
so the brain fog is the hardest part
yesterday i just sat there and just
stared at a wall for 18 hours i think
uh i could barely do anything
and
i tried sleeping a massive amount
because which i never do and let me tell
you i hate sleeping oh god i hated it
i did a lot of it
i probably needed it but man i hated it
and
i started dreaming again
because i haven't dreamed in decades
because i don't sleep enough to actually
get to the
rapid eye movements so i slept enough to
dream
i didn't like it at all
how do you people put up with dreams
they're all just like annoying
frustrating things
i mean it's not like i had like an
awesome sex dream or something that'd be
cool
but no just like awesome weird things
that bother you that's all
so
i'm sorry that you dream
i don't plan to do any more of that
um here's something i learned
did you know that uh george washington
didn't know dinosaurs existed
um
that george
check this to see if it's true
but uh the first dinosaur was discovered
in the early 1800s
and george washington had already lived
and died by them
yeah if you want to say remember my
dreams that's more accurate that's true
um
you're low in b vitamins if you can't
remember your dreams no it just means i
don't sleep more than four hours a night
that's what it usually means
so i never get to the rapid eye movement
stuff
didn't that no i don't have a sore
throat i do have a dry cough
and a runny nose and
brain fog
it's awful
but i also
i couldn't take a tylenol because i
couldn't eat
i'm just
super
nauseous all the time
i also had this problem which is i
couldn't eat anything
because my mouth was so dry
that it would just turn into concrete in
my mouth
i couldn't just
take a piece of bread and just eat it
it would turn into
like i couldn't even swallow it it just
would turn into some kind of
weird thing
keep using mouthwash somebody says
oh well uh anyway
i saw a movie called the lost city
last night with sandra bullock anybody
seen that
pretty good
pretty good a little too long as usual
but sandra bullock makes good movies i
think sandra bullock and
tom cruise are the last
you know great stars it seems like
but yeah i was watching sandra bullock
and i was trying to figure out how old
is she because she looks exactly like
she's always looked
and she's 57
and she looks maybe when she paid her
she was 55
but
oh my god
oh my god just whatever
whatever fitness thing she's doing is
working out
um
and she's older than uh her co-star so
they finally had the older woman younger
guy situation going on there
well you know when we've got these
school shootings we need aoc to tell us
what the basic problem is and she came
through for us
she said that
basic problem is america's patriarchal
society and masculinity that's quote
rooted in the subjugation of other
people
so if we had less patriarch patriarchal
society
and our masculinity was not rooted in
the subjugation of other people
we might shoot less people
but i ask you this question
interesting hypothesis
but would that mean that wherever there
is the greatest patriarchal societies
you would have the most mass shootings
and i don't think that's the case is it
because when i run through my mind of
all the mass shooting
places that also have
well all the places that have a
patriarchal society i don't feel like
they have a lot of mass shootings there
i feel like the more patriarchal the
society the the fewer there are
did anybody do the do the math
all right
i don't know everybody's got a theory
um
the other theory is that there's too
many missing dads what do you think of
that
that all the bad behavior
and the school shootings are from
missing dads
uh lots of yeses that's a conservative
point of view there's missing dads
um here's the counter to that hypothesis
there does seem to be a correlation
so the people who don't have dads do
seem to get more trouble
that part we all agree on right if you
don't have a dad
more likely to get in trouble
uh i think i think that data stands
but
do they have the correlation
or the causation correct
let me ask you this would there be
anything about
the people whose fathers left or didn't
have a father in the first place would
to be anything else that that group had
in common
other than the fact that the child
doesn't have a dad
wouldn't it be a lot
don't the people who only have one
parent have a lot in common
poverty for example
poverty
and what about the nature of the dad
do we believe that genetics
don't have any role in anything
if you're a dad who's likely to leave
or to not take care of a kid
does that genetic
propensity
is it likely to follow to the child
i mean not every time of course
but crazy xyz yeah and yeah did the uh
the father leave because the mother's
crazy
what kind of mental health
do couples have if you know
on average if they've broken up versus
if they didn't
i don't know
seems to me
seems to me
they've got a lot of correlations there
and they've picked out one
no dad
bad behavior
seems to me that the no dad thing and
the bad behavior are both caused by the
same thing
which is
parents who are not quite fit to be
parents
and if you have two parents that are not
fit to be parents
and you put them together and have a
child is that child going to be really
competent
i don't know maybe
but it seems like it seems like you're
selecting for a certain personality type
that the
single and having a baby
on average this is not about every
person right everybody's in a different
situation but on average
you don't think you could find a
correlation with a lot of other stuff
other than that the dad was there or the
dad was not there to me it seems like
the missing dad is a symptom
of some deeper problem
and
you know it affected the dad in the same
way it affected the kid i don't know i'm
just saying that i don't believe
that it's as simple as no dad
equals mass shooter more likely i don't
think it's that simple
how about this one
um how many of the
mass shooters also played violent video
games do you know that i don't think
i've ever seen that mentioned
so of the mass shootings the school mass
shootings
how many of them
played a lot of violent video games
because i feel like it's every one of
them but i've never seen that mentioned
depends on the decade
now you're saying everyone plays violent
video games but not not as often
now even if everyone did that doesn't
mean the game is causing it but it might
for some people
you know 99.9 percent of people are
going to be completely unaffected by
their entertainment choices
but it only takes one to pick up a gun
all right so that's a sort of an open
question
um
sirius xm host dean
abadila obadily
so i guess he was arguing that there's
no constitutional right to own a gun and
that it's a
mirage you know there's no such thing as
a constitutional right to own a gun
what do you think of that
i feel like that's ridiculous
and it's not because the constitution
says you could own a gun
that's not why
it doesn't matter what the constitution
says
if the supreme court says that's what it
says
then you have the right
that's how it works right
the the constitution of the united
states could be just the uh
you know a dictionary
with nothing in it
but if the supreme court says yeah it's
right there i see it there's a right to
own a gun right in there
then you have the right to own a gun
that's what that's what our system is
the system is the supreme court tells
you what's there
and if they make up something
that's your right
because didn't they make up the right of
uh
abortion
i mean that was basically they pieced
together some privacy elements from
different places and sort of made
something up right
so
so what if
what if you buy the premise
and i don't
i mean i'm willing to actually i am
willing to but what if you bought the
premise
that the actual original constitution
did not contemplate
gun ownership the way we have it today
it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter
because the supreme court said it's
there
that's how our system works
it doesn't matter if it's there
it to have the right now if you're
arguing that the supreme court made it a
mistake
that's a good argument
or at least one that you would you know
you could credibly make
but once they've decided
you do have the right
that's what it means to have a right
means
you know somebody gave it to you
now some say you have rights to do
everything until the government takes it
away well okay
i'll give you that but the government
does tell you what is what is and what
is not allowed in our current system
yeah the federalist papers help explain
some of the framers thinking doesn't
matter does it
it really doesn't matter if it's in the
original document
it only matters if the supreme court is
willing to say it's there that's all
all right
um
washington post senior editor
mark fisher i guess on thursday he
tweeted that the ar-15 was quote
invented for nazi nazi infantryman
the the quality of our
discourse is so bad
what if it was
and the volkswagen was invented by
hitler
so
should you not buy a volkswagen
i actually know some people won't buy a
volkswagen for that reason
but
what if it was you know
what if this is true
i don't know if that is true but what if
it is
does it matter it's completely
irrelevant to the question of whether
you want one i don't care who invented
it
do you
all right
and documentary filmmaker michael moore
has called for the u.s to repeal the
second amendment entirely
all right well i guess you'd go say
something pretty extreme to get some
attention these days
but
um
i don't see that happening
let me ask you this
we're all afraid of the slippery slope
right
and if you restricted gun laws in any
way
would you agree
that it encourages
more restrictions
i think that's true if somebody asks for
a restriction and gets it they're going
to say oh that worked
let's ask for some more restrictions
see if we can get them right so i think
we pretty much all agree
that the slippery slope is a real thing
can we agree
in this specific example i don't i'm
anti-slippery slope
for lots of things
but in this specific example there's no
question that if you asked for something
you want and you got it
why wouldn't you ask for something else
it doesn't wouldn't make any sense not
to i mean in that case it's pretty
straightforward right
so
let me ask you this
is there any area in american life
in which the
um
age limit
um disallowed young people from doing
something and then that situation
specifically just an age limit question
nothing else
just an age limit has that ever become a
slippery slope
cigarettes have an age limit
alcohol has an age limit
drinking
how did that become a slippery slope
voting
now we've we've changed those things
we've altered the age
but that didn't lead to changes in
non-age-related things did it
to me it just looks like there were just
a bunch of things that were done
and all right let me ask you this is
there anything that has an age limit on
it now
that you think should not
all right let's here's the new question
is there anything that has an age
restriction on it now
that you think you should not
somebody said work well works a special
yeah i'll give you work okay
but we're not talking about work
um
all right
so here's the question
gay sex
here's the question
do you think that putting an age limit
on firearms
for let's say 21 or 25 for let's say and
ar
do you think that that would become a
slippery slope
toward more restrictions
mostly yes a lot of no's
yeah
it makes you
it makes you wonder if there's some way
to manage that
because i think
if you could convince republicans
[Music]
let me ask you this behind closed doors
if you were talking privately to your
republican senator do you think your
republican senator would say that
increasing the age limit for ars
would be a bad idea
now forget about the slippery slope
problem just if that if you could only
do that do you think any senators would
disagree with that
probably not
probably not behind closed doors i don't
think so
they would just be worried about how it
looks and what it might lead to right
yeah i think they would agree that
everything needs an
age limit
and
how about this
how about this
suppose you're republicans and you say
here's the deal
we'll put an age limit on the ar
firearms
but in return we want a
age restriction on social media
boom
ah
let that sink in for a moment just let a
second
right
because if you if you make a deal
then you have less odds of the slippery
slope right
am i right
because that would be a deal
you'd say okay well we fixed social
media
um and we're giving up a little bit on
guns
so that's not exactly like a slippery
slope that's more like a deal where you
both got something
see the slippery slope happens when
somebody gets something and the other
for free
and the other team just gave something
away
if you could guess something just by
asking for it
wouldn't you do more of it of course you
would but if you could only guess
something by making a deal or you've got
to give up something to get it well
you're going to do a lot less of it
because there aren't that many deals to
be had
so
why don't we stop arguing about whether
social media is hurting people
or
guns
and just make a deal say these are two
things that kids shouldn't be doing
or young people
shouldn't be doing these shouldn't be on
social media until maybe 18
and shouldn't get a gone until maybe
whatever whatever we decide
i'm not sure 25 is the right number but
uh feels like 21 is the right number at
the very minimum
because the number of number of people
under 21 who are doing it i think you
had to have to see the data to know what
the right number is
uh unenforceable somebody says yeah well
that's true of every law right
you can't make people
what's unenforceability
unenforceable that kids use social media
now you could you could police that
pretty easily
you have to be 35 to president so why
not make everything 35 well
you know the presidency is one of those
few things where the older you are maybe
the better you are up to a certain point
i mean the 70s and 80s is too old
but
certainly between 35 and 65
well here's something i can speak to
with great um
great personal knowledge
if you compared what i know today as 65
to what i knew at 35
it's a pretty big difference
and i would i would be afraid of me
being president of 35
at 65 i could do the job
so could you probably a 65.
it's just that you learn enough along
the l along the path they think oh yeah
i could do that job
i could do that job
but at 35 i didn't know how anybody
could do that job it just looked
impossible
like i thought how in the world do you
find somebody who could be present
there's so many topics
so much to do and now i just look at it
and think i could do that yeah i could
do that
um
yeah rural kids hunt
you could make exceptions for
you know hunting
i suppose
or you could also make an exception that
says
you know if you're under a certain age
you could use a head gun if you're with
somebody over a certain age
how about that that's what they do with
automobiles right
if you're just getting your permit
you can drive as long as you're with
somebody older
well if you're hunting
correct me if i'm wrong when you hunt
you usually go with somebody else don't
you
i i don't hunt so how many people hunt
alone
hunting is usually with another person
right
like
oh some of you do hunt alone okay so
there's a little both but it wouldn't be
a big deal to say that if you're 18 you
need to be with somebody older
i don't i don't know they would probably
wouldn't make that much difference in
your happiness would it
um would the age limit apply to women oh
now there's a provocative question
you mofo
that is such a good question
[Laughter]
all right here's the question
since women basically never do mass
shootings
why should there be any age limit for
women to own a handgun or any kind of
gun
i agree
i i hate it but i agree
i hate that this is a clear a clear case
where discriminating against men makes
complete sense
am i right
usually usually i'm i'm on that soapbox
don't discriminate against men
you know there's enough of that already
too much pushback you know it's going
too far
but
if you ask me what's more dangerous a
man having access to guns at 17
or
a woman
let's say a woman at 17.
i don't think there's any
any comparison
there's no comparison
and if you want to throw in lgbtq
okay with me
until there's a mass shooting from an
lgbtq
uh member oh actually there probably
have been
i'll bet there have been right somebody
do me a fact check on that but if it's
never happened
don't they have an argument
i suppose it never happened yeah
orlando's maybe that might have been gay
right the orlando shooter but i think
that was
undetermined
uh
you think you yuvaldi was
you think
you think that he was gay
the shooter
i haven't heard that
why would you care if i got vaccinated
somebody says they're on the comments on
youtube
that they forgive me for getting
vaccinated
because i'm i'm doing these things
um
all right gerald you can go away
goodbye
the media said um the uvalde shooter was
gay
well let me be clear about my
vaccination
decisions
it's none of your business
i mean i'm happy to tell you what i did
but
your opinion of what i should do
doesn't have any
impact on me
ar-15s are very seldom used in homicides
but they're used often in mass shootings
i saw the list recently
spiraling into the brain fog probably
all right
pretty much all the data on the school
shootings is fake there was a story
saying there were 27
mass school shootings but really it was
27 school shootings which would include
any gun activity
including one-on-one and even when
nobody got hurt or killed
so it's a problem but
all our data is incorrect
so basically it's
all bad data
all right
um
so how about ukraine
so i saw on fox i think it was a fox
news story in which buried at the bottom
of the article
they basically say that uh
putin won the war
that his primary goal was controlling
the you know the east part of ukraine
and he now has it
so he has
he's actually won the war
what do you think
has russia won the war and now all
they're doing is consolidating
yeah the ruble is doing well
there doesn't seem to be
a massive civil war
they seem to be able to adjust so far
so if that's true
if russia
essentially succeeded
then would you also say that all the
money we spent to prevent it was wasted
did we waste all of our money
because we didn't prevent anything
nothing happened except it took longer
for russia to do it and probably killed
more people than they would have
otherwise
i feel like we completely screwed the
pooch
now
i'm not saying that we didn't have good
intentions
but i don't think it destroyed russia
i don't think it's going to replace
putin
and
it made a war on your neighbors look
like a good idea
did it not
because 10 years from now
putin's gonna this is just going to look
like a great victory for putin within
his own country so i would say that we
managed to show that russia can
attack their neighbors with old
equipment and get away with it
uh
all right so let's
so somebody's saying but wait you
claimed ukraine victory a few days ago
it depends what you think
was putin's goal
if you believe that putin's goal was to
take over the entire country
then he failed
and it doesn't look like you will
succeed anytime soon
but
now even fox news is saying well his
primary goal was
that stuff on the east so he got all of
that
to which i say
here's your story where ukraine won and
also russia won
it's the only way you can get past it
so the only way this can end
is if putin says i got total success i
took the parts i wanted and ukraine says
total success or
large success because we we're still
ukraine we're smaller
but we're still ukraine and we're still
fighting to
to liberate those
entities
and so i think you can say with complete
confidence that russia won the war and
also ukraine won the war it's the only
war where both sides won
it's the best war of all
both sides won
we were played yes we were
um
apparently trump is using ultra mega
uh to fundraise
no surprise right so as soon as you
heard biden saying there was this ultra
mega group
and and almost everybody
who was pro-trump said
ultra mega
ultra mega
yeah
that sounds pretty good
so the democrats are just
hideously bad at this branding stuff
and trump of course is the best of all
time
so every time they they take the worst
branders in the world and they go
against the best brander in the world it
always turns out like this it always
goes this way and as soon as they said
it you all knew what trump was going to
do
you knew he was going to snatch the gun
out of their hand and turn it around you
knew that he's done it too many times
for you not to know that especially with
ultra mega
i mean as soon as you heard it you're
like okay i see where this is going and
it did
all right
and i guess
trump is calling the january 6th
uh business
uh he says
calling it an insurrection is a hoax
a hoax you say
now when you hear uh that that word hoax
does it make you feel like
there's some kind of voices he listens
to more than others
or that somebody does
because i'm not sure hoax was a word
that we would have used for this sort of
thing
five years ago
am i right
hoax hoax feels like
a branding thing and i think i think
mike cernovich is primarily
and the one who brought hoax
into the political conversation am i
right
that was sort of it's right now i use it
all the time but i think ceravic is the
the father of that that word
for political purposes
so
so trump has picked up on that now i
fixed him
a typo and then republished my list of
10
top 10 hoaxes
but i added another typo in there so i
fixed the typo that i added when i
fixed the other typo
but then there was another typo in there
that i fixed so i'm on my fourth edition
of it this morning
have i mentioned i have brain fog
has that come up at all i think i
mentioned that earlier right
yeah it's really hard just to do basic
stuff
it is hard to do basic stuff
i tried to find some tylenol yesterday
if you're coming in late i'm second day
of coving symptoms
and i couldn't figure out how to get
tylenol
like it took me half a day
to figure out how to get tylenol i just
door dashed it eventually
but
yeah now
so i see you're prompting me about the
uh
the nancy pelosi's husband getting a dui
i don't know that that has anything to
do with anything
honestly i think when a family member
gets in trouble
that's just too far for me
i
you know if if one of the trump kids did
something
unsavory
i would just say that's about them
i don't think that i don't think that
nancy pelosi's husband
is telling us anything about nancy
pelosi or about politics or anything
important
um
yeah maybe he's done some insider
trading that's another question i don't
know about that
tells us that the head case theory is
real i don't know
hunter's laptop that's on the hoax list
what about the big guy
so i guess the amber heard uh jury
continues tomorrow
do you think what do you think that's uh
going to end up where is that going to
end up
does it look like johnny is going to win
you think amber wins
i don't know because
what i didn't hear is the law
generally during a trial there's some
point where somebody describes the law
and then they say you're seeing if these
if this criteria is being met
to say that the law has been broken or
or if there's libel or whatever whatever
the charges
i haven't heard that
so what i haven't heard
is you must prove this
and here's what they
here's the evidence they presented so i
don't really have a
i don't have a sense of who's winning in
this in the court of public opinion
johnny depp one
can we agree on that
then the court of public opinion johnny
depp one now imagine if johnny depp
loses this
imagine that
imagine losing this
that would be pretty bad
because it would just be more abuse on
top of the other abuse and by the way
i'm not so sure that he's never done
anything wrong in his life
so it's not like i'm a a huge johnny
depp makes no mistakes kind of guy
uh but it would look like she was the
abuser and she got away with even more
so that would be
um
that would be bad no i haven't watched
norm mcdonald's special yet uh where is
it by the way
the the norm mcdonald special that he
did before he passed
and we're just seeing it now it's on
netflix all right i will watch that i'll
watch it today actually
uh
am i a fan of 21 jump street not really
not really
um
oh yeah then biden implied in his speech
recently that
um trump supporters killed a cop
on january 6 which didn't happen
it's amazing
it is really amazing watching
uh how much biden lies
and how much that's not being called out
it's really incredible
um
you said multiple cops did you say they
killed two cops
when they were actually zero
uh some of you are well behind on my
personal life
so uh they're
yeah so i'm divorced in case anybody's
not caught up catching on
i'm in the process of divorce
all right um
you didn't know that
erica attention
all right
um
biden's while lies are worse than trump
oh i don't know
now in case you're wondering um
the
is a reasonable question is the brain
fog from marijuana or from covent i can
only tell you this
that
i often smoke marijuana to get smarter
in a creative way
so creativity actually is enhanced
and for what i do it actually helps
but i can tell you that whatever is
going on now is not enhancing anything
i am just dumber
i am just dumber right now
there's no
no marijuana effect going on
do i know how i got coveted i don't
because apparently you can get it from
you know like a week or two before you
know you have it
so i have no idea if i had to guess
probably the airplane
the only other place that i was with a
crowd
and there's nobody in my personal life
that i know that has it
so i don't know anybody
that i've been anywhere near that has it
yeah
i've asked people to test and they have
so i'm guessing it was what i flew
yeah it was probably maui because i had
basically no human contact in maui
and it was just the plane
so i know
now the movie theater is where i got the
symptoms but they would have been there
for days before the movie
i'm only taking tylenol right now
i got the flu when i flew
true enough
yeah you know i i do think that planes
are relatively safe because their
filtration systems are so good
but
i don't really know where else i would
have gotten it because i don't know
anybody i don't know anybody else who
has it
in fact the other day i was saying why
is it i don't know anybody who has
covered
like i used to always know somebody but
at the moment i didn't know anybody
a tylenol bleach
yeah it's the first time i got a copy
and my
my vaccinations have worn off
so i'm i'm effectively unvaccinated at
this point i did the first two but
that's it
all right eric i see you coming
i appreciate it
um oh here's another factoid i meant to
mention
so prior to getting coveted
um whenever i got it last few weeks i
was aware that my
immunity was at its lowest point that i
could remember
now that can't be a coincidence right
and i knew my natural immunity was
in the basement
because for about two weeks i hadn't
been able to sleep
and i was just completely exhausted all
the time so i was very aware that i
could get sick because my immunity was
so low and then sure enough
which makes me wonder if the omicron is
is so
measly
that you don't even get it if you're
basically healthy
i wonder if i wonder if my normal good
health would have just slapped it away
because it's been
i was trying to think the last time i
felt
this sick
and i'm thinking
30 years
maybe 30 years this is as sick as i've
been in 30 years
because i don't even get bad colds or
like regular flus
in decades i can't remember anything
like this even when i get a cold it's
just a sniffle for a day or something
that's about it
yeah so let me say what other people
have said
this doesn't feel like a
organic disease
whatever's happening in my head
is not like any other thing that's ever
happened to me
and my body as well
and
the hardest part is the temperature
dysregulation
because if i just walk from my office to
another part of the house
i might have to change my shirt twice
because i'll put on my sweatshirt
because i'm freezing
i'll open the door to walk down the hall
and i'll be sweating i'll take off my
sweatshirt to the end of the hall and
then i'll be freezing again i'll put on
my sweatshirt it's actually that fast
the temperature thing could go on and on
hormones
back pain for three days wow
all right
take a bath to regulate your temperature
is that a thing
i don't know
all right that's all for now and i'm
gonna go do something else which is
probably just sleeping
and i will talk to you
later
bye for now
