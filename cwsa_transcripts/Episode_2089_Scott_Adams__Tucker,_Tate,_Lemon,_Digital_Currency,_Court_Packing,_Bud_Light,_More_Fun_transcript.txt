good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization best thing that ever
happened to you and anybody you'd know
and if you'd like to take your
experience to levels that nobody's ever
seen before in the known universe all
you need is a cup of mugger glass a
tanker Chalice of Stein a canteen Joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now of the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous if it
happens now go
that's some good stuff
well I know what you all want to talk
about
Tucker Carlson and the news and stuff
like that but I'd like to suggest a
theme for today's live stream do you
like it when I have a theme
when all the news coincidentally seems
to fit
a theme
and here it is
we'll put it together uh as we go
but first I would like to do a
demonstration of the wisdom of my
audience the smartest audience in the
history don't answer don't answer the
question before I ask it stop it stop it
they're answering the question correctly
before I've asked the question that is
unbelievable
unbelievable it's actually happening
it's happening on YouTube too now
I I'm just blown away how some more my
audience is well now that you know the
answer
let me ask the question
according to erasmussen poll
what percentage of Americans I think
it's likely voters but something like
that about what percent of these
Americans are not concerned about
domestic spying
oh you all get it right it's exactly 25
percent
25 percent
yeah it turns out that 74 of likely U.S
voters are very concerned or they're
concerned and then half of them half the
people are very concerned but 25 percent
not concerned one bit about the
government watching everything you're
doing
no problem with that whatsoever
so pat yourself on the back if you got
that one right
I'm going to keep quizzing you until you
get one wrong
yeah I'm just going to keep keep asking
questions until I can find anything you
guys don't know it's amazing
all right
have I ever told you that all news about
public figures is fake
have I ever mentioned that
like maybe a lot of times like maybe
almost every day
yeah
so I'm going to tell you a bunch of news
about uh public figures
how much of it should you believe
the answer is that 25
now the answer is zero
it might be that all of the facts are
accurate
so I might be telling you all accurate
facts based on the news
but how often are all the accurate facts
that you hear in the news a complete and
accurate picture of what was going on
basically never it's just not even a
thing and I'm I'm saying this based on
my own experience
I've been a public figure in the subject
of news for 30 years
it's never true
they'll get maybe your birthday right
and even that's a deposit
all right so let's talk about some
famous people
saw a tweet from Tristan Tate one of the
Tate brothers
and I guess they got
brought back into court in Romania
and things are getting really sketchy
over there
right the the news is just so incomplete
but would you agree that whatever we're
hearing about Romania and the the Tate
Brothers is probably inaccurate would
you agree
do you think we know anything about
what's going on let me tell you this
tweet just to give you a a sense of how
little we know about what's happening
all right
this is from Tristan Tate he says they
meaning Romania they charged me
yesterday with quote inciting violence
toward others
and then he says I thought it was a
human trafficker where's the evidence
for that
uh oh yeah that's right they don't have
any so they make something else up all
right
now I'm not gonna uncritically assume
that the defendant is telling the truth
that would be sort of a stretch but do
you think that Romania is acting in a
way that sounds like just a government
looking to handle crime
there's something else going on there
isn't there
don't you feel like there's something
else going on
yeah
now do you think that one way to
characterize the Tate Brothers problems
is bad behavior toward women
do you think that's at the heart of it I
mean there there's some other
allegations swirling around but it seems
like
some kind of behavior regarding women
not women in general but the women who
may have worked with him in his
operation now those are the accusations
I'm not saying I'm not saying I know
what's true
but those are the accusations the women
are accusing them of being bad men who
do bad things
all right let's talk about Tucker
Carlson
uh
so Tucker Carlson and Fox News
are going to part ways but apparently
it's only the show
I guess his contract will probably be
paid out the news is saying
so Dr Carlson is having a terrible day
where he just learned that he gets to
spend as much time as he wants with his
family and doing whatever he wants and
instead of working he'll be and being
the subject of everybody's hate he'll
just make 20 million dollars a year from
staying home
so bad day for him huh
yeah
he he must be I'll bet he's crying
himself to sleep
probably crying himself to sleep but
given that we know absolutely nothing
about this situation and it wouldn't
surprise me if Tucker doesn't know why
he was fired either
because it's all what's in people's
heads right
I mean it Whatever happened there will
never really know I don't think we'll
ever know the the real truth but don't
you think it's a some kind of average of
what people have in their private
thoughts
you know there's some executive who has
a private thought about this or that
there's another executive who has a
private thought about this or that
there's you know Murdoch and the Murdoch
you know kids
who have different thoughts about
different things and then some decision
gets made
so
you're going to see all kinds of reasons
for him getting fired
but none of them none of them
individually seem to rise to the level
of really
that's the reason you're getting that
they got rid of the show
but I'll list them all right so the
Daily Beast says helpfully put together
a list as have other media and they've
got their own ideas but among the many
many many things that Tucker Carlson did
uh he used the c word
a lot
he used the c word a lot and there's
something about his comments about
Sidney Powell
now it's a little unclear if the c word
was used
in conjunction with a conversation about
Sydney Powell or if those were just
different
topics
now
um
correct me if I'm wrong but when you use
the c word at work
that really angers men I'll tell you men
really get bad about that
you use that c word in front of a group
of men and nobody else and those men
will be like hey hey don't use that word
so I'm just assuming that men complained
about his use of that word
um
he made disparaging remarks about
management
is there anybody who hasn't never made a
disparaging remark About Management
are you kidding me
I'm doing a live stream which is almost
entirely people who want to see me
and even most of you have made
disparaging remarks about me
I mean maybe not in that you might you
might like some things too but everybody
makes disparaging remarks about
everybody what's different is that his
emails may have been surfaced her
Communications may have been surfaced
during that lawsuit so maybe some of
those Executives saw some discouraging
or disparaging remarks the The Daily
Beast also says it's something about his
January 6 conspiracy coverage
now do you think that there was anybody
at Fox News who said out loud
the problem is is January 6 coverage
Maybe
but this sounds like just something that
The Daily Beast would make up because
they want it to be true
it feels like wishful thinking doesn't
it
Dan Dan the NPC says Scott you ignorant
that's almost a sentence there goodbye
thanks for joining us
um
let's see what else has he approved oh
he's all Tucker is also accused of a
former producer has a lawsuit that says
it was a sexist environment
now he's not being accused of any of me
too stuff
but rather the way he talked
was sexist
so
um and that's the sort of thing that men
who work with probably complained a lot
about
so I can imagine Tucker talking to the
guys and the guys are like whoa whoa
Tucker that's a little bit sexist
can you calm that down a little bit calm
that down we men don't like that at all
uh let's see what else
uh Oliver Darcy says it's related to
ex-producers lawsuit
for his rampant sexism and then Oliver
Darcy as he then throws this in and
anti-semitic Behavior
um
what would be an example of anti-Semitic
Behavior
now I would understand if they said he
had anti-semitic words like words
I can imagine somebody doing that not
necessarily Tucker but you could imagine
a person doing something that's
anti-Semitism but what exactly was his
behavior
do you think that's real
did he start a little Holocaust of his
own there
was his behavior to overtly discriminate
against Jewish employees or Jewish
guests
seems like if they had a specific
we might have heard it
does that sound like just something that
was made up by CNN
does that sound true
remember a hundred percent of stories
about famous people are not true
now I only see this stuck in in the CNN
report
like I don't even The Daily Beast which
is no friend of Tucker's doesn't mention
anything about any anti-semitic thing
do you know that when I got canceled
the ADL somebody from the ADL came after
me they tried to make it anti-semitic
just kind of tack onto the story a
little bit well
you know maybe he did something
anti-semitic too
right well he said some bad things that
had nothing to do with us but we think
we could maybe tag on a little bit and
get a little juice from this too
so
uh that's probably ridiculous but it's a
serious accusation so
we'll uh we'll put a pin in it but if
you don't hear this from other entities
it sounds like it's just a CNN little
little Jab
all right
all right uh
profanity laced remarks now there's
another thing that men hate men hate it
when men swear
so a lot of men were mad at Tucker at
Fox News that's for sure
um
and maybe uh
maybe something about the advertisers
wanting to stay away from uh Tucker's
show
it did seem to be that Tucker did not
have the
a-level advertisers
and you know I've always wondered how
Fox News even makes money
when I see the advertisements that
they're wrong I think to myself
how many pillows can you sell
or you know how much gold do people need
I I don't really even understand their
business model because when I look at if
I look at a commercial on one of the
major networks you know it's going to be
some big Pharma company or something and
you say oh I understand that they make
money that big Pharma company is paying
them a lot of money to advertise but Fox
advertisers don't look like they even
have money
I don't even know where they get their
money I mean they seem like smaller
outfits I just don't know how the
honestly I don't know how they make
money
um like literally I don't understand how
they do it
so
maybe it's that
um then RFK Jr said it was something
about not long after
uh RFK Jr was on the show and talking
about big Pharma so RFK Jr thinks it
might be something about big Pharma
pushing back
what do you think of all those reasons
which ones do you find compelling
knowing that we'll never know all right
it could be that the real reason is some
reason is not even in the news right so
some say big Pharma some say lawsuits
uh potential lawsuits
some say RFK some say a combination some
say it's a rayap story the January 6th
stuff
don't want to get sued basically right
um
you think it was Kennedy you think it
was Dominion you think it's j6 some say
insurance
all right what if I taught you let's see
if you remember this lesson
what does it mean when everybody has a
different opinion of why it happened
what's that mean what can you conclude
from the fact that all The Observers
have a different opinion
well nobody knows
nobody knows it might also be unknowable
because like I say it was a I'm sure it
was a group decision
you know even though Murdoch could make
the decision himself I'm sure it was a
group you know they consulted but I
don't think that they each knew what was
in the minds of the other
obviously they
said what they want to say
but maybe their actual secret thoughts
were for themselves and they just made
the argument that was fit for other
people to hear
so I got a feeling it was just a bunch
of people who had a bunch of problems
and when the bunch of problems reached
the level where it was higher than the
benefit
they pulled the trigger
yeah it could be the power the Paul Ryan
effect he's on the board and doesn't it
could be that the Carlson was too
friendly
not friendly but too beneficial to Trump
getting elected
because if Tucker kept going at the
January 6th thing
then that would make Trump stronger
all right
so
I guess we don't know what it was
exactly
but I'll tell you
the uh the spot that he's in so the
people who have been in that spot was uh
let's see Bill Bill O'Reilly was there
in that APM spot
Megan Kelly was there
right
um and now Tucker was there somebody
else there Glenn Beck right so Glenn
Beck Megyn Kelly and O'Reilly and now
Tucker
so if you had to
come up with a name for what you would
call that eight o'clock block
I would call it the the kill me block
you know if you go there you might as
well just kill me right just kill me
um so who did they have as a guest host
in the kill me
slot last night
just guess just imagine that you live in
the simulation and everything is meant
to be a joke
you don't know it but it's like a
physical joke that's being played on us
who would they put in the kill me spot
Brian kill me duh
Brian kill me duh was in the kill me
slot
I mean come on
come on
total simulation
I didn't say it was funny I just said it
was a simulation messing with us you can
decide on your on your own if it's funny
I mean it's not my joke it's a
simulation
so let's see uh
we got all those possibilities
um
now the the speculation also is
what's going to happen to Tucker where
will he go
and everybody's got their own guesses
um
now there are two lines of thinking and
they're both worthy of exploring one
says that Tucker is a singular
personality he's bigger than Fox News
and when he wherever he goes if he goes
independent he could become The Joe
Rogan of you know independent people or
something like that
but even Joe Rogan depends on
advertisers doesn't he
it's going to be a little bit tough
for uh Tucker to find advertisers
because he couldn't find it for a show
so I mean if Fox News can't get you an
Advertiser it'd be hard to scrounge one
up on your own but I suppose he could I
suppose good yeah uh Mike cernovich
accurately points out
that Tucker is sort of a target for
lawsuits so unless you've got some big
organization behind you to pay your
legal bills it's it's too risky to be in
business The Way Tucker does business
maybe maybe but you know if you're
making Joe Rogan kind of money you can
also buy Joe Rogan kind of insurance
and Dr doesbank Joe Rogan mummy so he
can buy insurance
I don't know if you can buy you know 100
million dollars worth of insurance but
maybe he can I don't know
so
so some say he's going to go to the
independent route now others say and I
think they're not wrong
the Fox News is the star
and the the eight o'clock spot is the
star and you could put it in anybody
good and they would have huge ratings
because it's about the platform
that's not wrong
you know I've been telling for you for
years that whatever you want to whatever
you want to say to complain about Fox
News there's one thing that they do
consistently well
and have for years
which is their producers really produce
yeah see that looks poorly produced to
me as does MSNBC but Fox News
consistently looks like the producers
the people behind the curtain are just a
higher level of operators they just seem
more effective to me so they can put on
a show
and maybe it's the show is the star and
they can put in interesting people and
you know picking picking the right
celebrity
or the right personality is part of
producing
so
I'm going to say that their eight
o'clock hour is going to do fine
what do you think
now it might take him a while to find
their footing but I think they're going
to put in somebody who's as interesting
yeah maybe not on day one but as
interesting and you're going to tune in
because it's eight o'clock and the TV's
on and you're just gonna watch it
that's what happens when they got rid of
not got rid of but so in the after Glenn
back after O'Reilly after Megan Kelly
there the ratings just kept going up
so why won't that happen again so I'm
going to say that from the perspective
of Fox News
probably it looks like a pretty good
decision
does that surprise you if I'm if I'm
just going to do the business decision
the the things that have been listed as
the potential problems for Tucker if any
subset of that is true
yeah that's pretty good reasons pretty
good reasons
now because remember they would have
confidence that they can fill that slot
eventually with somebody who makes them
just as much money and they wouldn't
have the problems they wouldn't have the
lawsuits
so it's not a terrible business decision
it doesn't mean that it'll work out
right all businesses at risk so it could
be it could be the worst thing they ever
did but if you based it on their history
it was a smart business decision
which is not to I'm not trying to not
support Tucker I'm just saying you can
see it from my business perspective and
the risk was higher than the return
we'll see
um but how will Tucker do do you think
that he will go off and start his own
thing that's bigger than his old
audience
well I saw a reporting that says that
none of the three people I mentioned did
so Megan Kelly's doing well but doesn't
have the same size audience
Glenn Beck obviously is doing great on
the blaze but proudly the smaller
audience
and O'Reilly has got his own thing but
smaller audience so do you think Tucker
will go on to just have a nice solid
respectable podcast
and you know you'll just happily go on
Maybe
Maybe
there are a number of entities that
would uh try to get him news nation and
news Nations where uh
um
Chris yeah Chris Cuomo ended up
so that might make sense they're
independent
you know they're trying to hit some kind
of Middle Ground reporting
so I don't know I don't know if anybody
has enough money to pay him what he
needs but he could make a fortune as a
podcaster obviously so he's got lots of
options it's a good place to be
I would guess that his cancellation if
you want to call it that
feels a lot like mine did
which is everybody else thinks is worse
than it is for you and you're thinking
oh
well it's a good thing I spent my career
up to this point building a bunch of
skills
because if you have a bunch of skills as
stalker does he's got a ton of options
he has so many options I hope nobody's
feeling sorry for him is anybody feeling
sorry for Tucker I mean I wish I wish
things didn't happen that were bad for
anybody
but no he's doing great
I I would guess he's having a good week
if I had to guess
this following week will be more fun and
interesting and stimulating for Tucker
than the week before
because he was just sort of going to
work and grinding out the same show
after a show which had to be a lot of
work and now he's on vacation he's
getting paid the same the entire world
has opened up to him
I don't know looks pretty good for him
let's talk about uh
oh AOC
talked about
deep platforming works and it is
important so AOC is very happy about
Tucker being de-platformed
okay oh also some people think it's the
war in Ukraine because Tucker was
anti-war in Ukraine
um some say it's about the presidential
election
because you want to remove players from
the field
I think it's all of those things
I think it's all of those things
it's it's the whole bag of things that's
that's why it's we'll never hear there
was one thing
and if you do hear that it was one thing
I wouldn't believe it
it's it's all the things
um
how about Don Lemon
so Don Lemon
now I don't know if this is true but I'd
like to think it's true every once in a
while you like to think
um
you like to think that people do smart
things
if CNN was getting ready to fire down
lemon and then the unexpected news about
Tucker Carlson hit
wouldn't the smartest thing for them to
do is immediately Fire Dog lemon
so that his news is tagged on to
Tucker's news but it's behind it because
Tucker is going to get more attention
I think that's what they did if if they
didn't do that intentionally I'll be
very disappointed because it would be
one of the smartest media things I'd
ever seen I mean really really smart
you know they like to announce bad news
on a Friday before a three-day weekend
uh but this was even better you know
assuming that they they were ready to go
you know they'd already made it were
almost a decision to fire him that was
just such a good timing
and what was Don Lemon
um fired for well his uh diva-like
Behavior
do you think his diva-liked behavior was
bothering the men
the Menace he had done do you think the
men were saying that Don Lemon
he's acting so diva-like
I don't know based on the reporting
there are a lot of women in the
reporting who seemed angry at him and he
was being called misogynist
so the teeth are misogynist Tucker
Carlson was accused of being a
misogynist and now Don Lemon gay man is
being accused of being a misogynist
have you seen the pattern yet
do you know this pattern
yeah working with women is really
dangerous
working with women is going to put you
in jail and get you fired
that's where we are
basically if you're working with women
and there are a bunch of them
the odds that one of them will sue you
or call you a misogynist is nearly 100
percent it's nearly 100 percent
so it seems to me that the obvious
future of all men in public life is to
eventually be sued and fired in disgrace
because if you took a hundred of any
type of person so this has nothing to do
with being women right if this sounds
anti-woman just you can remove the woman
from the story and replace any
demographic there's a hundred of
whatever albonians
100 binaries 100 cisgender white men 100
anything if there are a hundred of them
you're going to have some bad ones
do you agree it doesn't matter who it is
a hundred human beings you're gonna have
some bad ones and if those bad ones have
this easy way to take out the men they
work with it's going to happen over time
so you so you're seeing the complete
inability of men and women to work
together
for long
now I'm not going to give men a pass
if you put men in any environment and
you wait long enough they're going to do
some bad stuff
because you know man
I can say that because I am one we do
bad stuff if you wait long enough
so men and women working together just
doesn't work
I hate to say it but in 2023 men and
women working together absolutely is too
dangerous
because some of the women are going to
complain and then that would have to be
taken seriously and probably it is
serious it probably is based on
something real
so
let me ask you this
do you remember when the metoo movement
was everywhere and people were getting
me too all over the place
did you notice it stopped
what's up with that
how did it stop
did the guys stop big guys I doubt it
did the women stop complaining
I actually don't know that I don't know
the answer but didn't we get one or two
metoo stories per day
and the closest we've come is wasn't
there some NBC executive
who admitted he had a consensual affair
with somebody in the at work and then he
quit but even that wasn't scandalous it
wasn't it wasn't even scandalous it just
seemed like there was an affair and that
was against the rules and that's about
the whole story
um
yeah
so that's how I'm going somebody says
all right
so uh
uh oh and uh it might be a little bit
racist to the Don Lemon stuff not that
not that Don Lemon was fired uh
because their management was racist I'm
not saying that so management was not
racist rather that Don Lemon was being
called a racist
and Don Lemon was being called a racist
because when he interviewed uh
um Vivek ramaswamy he said something
along the lines of that ramaswamy
couldn't speak about the post-civil war
history
because ramaswamy wasn't black
is that racist
I guess so I mean technically yes
okay
so Don Lemon was a racist misogynist
uh
as were basically all men in all of our
stories
how about a story that's not okay we
have a story that's not about
men and women fighting and the men
losing because that seems to be the
theme
all right here's one that just has
nothing to do with that
um Elizabeth Warren wants to pack the
courts so that they can get what they
want without having to worry about the
majority of the Republicans
so at least that has nothing to do with
you know women blaming men for stuff
right
oh yes except that that's exactly what
it is
it's a woman blaming the men on the
Supreme Court for abortion decisions
basically because this is all about
abortion
I don't think they were going to pack
the court until there was abortion
question
and what about guns maybe something
about guns
do you think guns are
maybe sort of have a gender split too
maybe so
here we have Elizabeth Warren trying to
destroy the most important part of the
Republic which is that we don't pack the
court
if I could if I could come to Earth as
some kind of a God and tell America how
the one thing they have to do right
imagine I I just appear as an angel uh
uh I have come to Earth
to tell America
you can do almost everything wrong and
recover
there's just one thing
I I just want to ask you just do one
thing right
don't pack the court
it's the only thing that could destroy
everything everything else we can figure
out
but if you pack the court
it's over
now how does she not know this
I think she
she puts the goal above the system
I put the system above the goal I
understand that they have a goal of you
know having the Supreme Court make
different decisions I got it
but if it were the other way I wouldn't
want to destroy the courts to get those
specific decisions
especially if it's something that God
has said to the state like abortion
but to me this looks like a decision she
doesn't like and so she's going to do
something to destroy the entire
civilization
so those men won't make that bad
decision anymore
she wants to destroy not wants to but
her proposal has a pretty high risk of
destroying the Republic and maybe all of
human civilization as a consequence of
that
so that's special
um Biden made his announcement
and he's got a theme for his
announcement
his theme will that he will be telling
lots of lies about Trump
so that's his sleeve so he's going to
start with the January 6 lies
he's going to go to the soul of the
nation that's the uh
um the Charlottesville fine people lie
um and probably a few other lies
so he's basing his campaign on lying
about Trump
I wouldn't expect much more than that
actually
um
do you think that the Democrats are
feeling trapped
do you think that Trump can finish off
Biden this time if it turns out to be
Trump versus Biden which is sort of
looking like
I don't know I thought Trump was going
to make an easy worker Biden the first
time
except for you know the the let's say
the changes to the voting system because
the pandemic just
made everything different
but don't you think Trump has more to
work with this time
last time it was all a hypothetical well
if you elect Biden you will do these bad
things but now we've seen Biden so
there's specific things to talk about
right energy blah blah
well many of you think this system is
rigged and that Trump can't win
do you think that the Republicans will
do an adequate job
of making sure that they're monitoring
elections better
I don't
I don't think the Republicans did
anything useful
so I wouldn't be surprised if the
campaign makes no difference to the
outcome
it wouldn't surprise me would it
surprise you
don't you think you could see a campaign
that clearly indicates one person is
going to win but then the other person
wins and you wouldn't be surprised
because we don't believe the system at
this point
yeah so I have no evidence that the
election system is rigged
I have no evidence of that
I only have uh a brain which tells me
that if anything can be rigged
it will be
if it can
and do you think that the election is
something that can be rigged
of course of course in some way big or
small
and someday today or later or yesterday
but yeah
it's a riggable system so therefore it
will be just eventually we don't know if
it happened yet or in the future
all right
um
so Biden put out his little video yeah
he's going to focus on January 6. isn't
that convenient that Tucker Carlson the
primary person who pushed back on
January 6
disappears right before Biden announces
that he's running and it's all going to
be about January 6th stuff
interesting
that's a lucky coincidence for Biden
right there
all right speaking of January 6. in a
story that reminds me of it apparently
uh a bunch of left-wing protesters
descended on Montana's capital
disrupting proceedings in the State
House of Representatives
this was in support of transgender
lawmaker Zoe Zephyr a Democrat now what
happens when uh protesters
they disrupt a government proceeding
what's that called there's there's a
word for that
inser
Insurrection yes Insurrection so the
next part of the story is that every one
of those that left-wing protesters were
rounded up and put in jail
do you believe that
no of course not
you don't put left-wing protesters in
jail what are you crazy
are you crazy
rayups was not there I know you're going
to ask
okay well so
what else can you even say about that
story
that you just have to shake your head
because you live in such a corrupt
country that that the Democrats can make
this coherent story that only applies to
this one situation but no that's not
going to apply to other situations no
all right
um
and do you think that the uh
do you think that the trans movement is
more about uh left-wing men or left-wing
women
who do you think are the primary backers
of the trans movement besides the trans
themselves besides the trans themselves
you're saying men I
know men are men might be transitioning
more often
but who are the non-trans people
supporting mostly women right
so this would be a case of women
complaining about men and the context
here is trans discrimination
all right
so do you see the theme it let's talk
about Bud Light
um so you know you all know this Bud
Light story so I don't have to tell you
that but apparently Bud Light
uh increase sales and some of their
other beverages at about the same rate
that Bud Light decrease sales so the
Budweiser boycott didn't work at all
in case you're wondering the Budweiser
boycott probably didn't make any
difference you know Budweiser doesn't
like it and they're paying some
expensive people to figure out you know
how to make their brand good and I don't
know if you saw the clip of Joe Rogan uh
laughing hysterically at Budweiser's new
commercial
because they tried to change the
commercial into America and
patriotism and Clydesdales and it was
just so over the top
pathetic that Rogan was just using it as
a joke to laugh at it
yeah it feels like they lost their way a
little bit but I don't think they're
going to lose their money so it looks
like Budweiser is gonna be fine
um let's talk about U.S digital currency
which you all want me to talk about but
you're not going to like what I have to
say
so that's why I've been avoiding talking
about it because you're not gonna like
it
all right here's what you want me to say
the government is looking at creating a
digital currency
not yet to replace cash
but we we assume that that's the
direction it's going
so what you want me to say is that we
should stop this immediately because as
soon as the government can control your
money and everywhere you spend it they
can just turn the knob on and off and
they can control you and that's an
unlivable future
so we must stop them from doing digital
currency
and I just can't make that argument
because unfortunately there's another
argument that's bigger than that
which is there's nothing you can do to
stop digital currency
do you seriously think you can stop
digital currency from replacing cash
there isn't anything that could do that
there's no protesting there's nothing
that could do that we absolutely are
going to have digital money that the
government can control and can control
you I can complain about it but it's not
going to be different
it might like delay at six months or
something
but no cash will not be the the way we
pay for things in a hundred years
no it's just going to be digital and
there's nothing you can do about it
so I see people signing off bye bye now
I'm not saying that I want it
I'm saying I don't complain about things
I can't change that's not a changeable
situation
now we might want to figure out how to
safeguard our our life in that situation
I haven't heard of any
ideas for that if I do you know maybe I
can back them but
yeah there's nothing you can do we will
be completely without privacy and we
will be completely controlled
I don't like it just to be just to be
clear it's not my first choice but
there's nothing you can do about it
um I suppose complaining could make
people think of better Alternatives but
I don't think there's going to be one
it's going to be digital now I don't
think it'll be as different in the
future as you think it will because
how many of you already pay for things
digitally anyway
how many of you are still writing checks
or giving cash to people
don't you pay on venmo or Google pay
at least let's say half or more of your
transactions
don't you
for the little stuff you know the little
services and stuff no
you're not there yet well you will be
yeah you will be
sooner or later this is going to happen
you need to pay somebody cash and you
won't have the cash with you you don't
have time to go to the ATM and then
you're going to say well I have this
thing called venmo I've never used
does that work and the person will say
yeah that works yeah Apple pay
I I think we're just going to sort of
drift into it from convenience and
there's nothing that can change it
all right if you think of a better uh
spin on that let me know
um
here's news from the Haitian Capital
it's over in Haiti where a crime is
rampant and the gang members are
practically running Society over there
this happened
a mob in the Haitian Capital pulled 13
suspected gang members from police
custody they actually took the gang
members from the police
and set them all on fire
put a tire on them I guess that's sort
of the way it's done put a tire on them
pour gas on them and set them on fire
so the the the law-abiding public in
Haiti
is so fed up that they actually attacked
the police
to take custody of their prisoners to
murder them in public
now that's some serious citizen action
right there now I'm not going to say
that's a trend
but I don't hate it
I don't hate it
looks like citizens might have to do
what they need to do
and
I'm predicting a wave of
vigilante action in in the U.S there's
only
what do you do if you're in a high crime
area and there's no police
you either have to fight yourself or
leave
if you leave well you get canceled I
hear I hear I hear bad things about
people who try to stay away from
potential trouble but
I don't know I think there's going to be
a lot more vigilantism
um
also a lot more mass shootings because
there's so many uh young men with no
purpose
so I think you're going to see a lot
more of that
all right here I'm going to uh
agree with Ibrahim kindy
here's something you didn't expect today
um
so I saw on Twitter people are tweeting
around Paul Graham had it the average
income of people by ethnic groups in the
United States
and what it showed is that the Indian
immigrants who are now Indian American
mostly
um have the highest
income by ethnic group and then there
are various Asian Americans we had them
who have high incomes compared to the
rest
and some people said
hey that means that if black people are
not doing as well as Indian Americans
and Chinese Americans Etc that must be
something wrong with black culture
so what is it about these Asian and
Indian cultures that allows them to
succeed
and the critics say it must be something
with Black Culture now Abraham kindy
says no it's systemic racism it's not
culture who do you think is right
who do you think is right is it culture
or is it systemic racism
what do you say
um well I'm going to agree with one of
the points that candy said especially
that the the immigration paths were
different
and that does matter
do you think that the uh the Asian and
Indian American immigrants
are coming here with the same
disadvantages of a freed slave
it's not even close I I feel as if the
people we're getting are you know often
technically proficient often came from a
you know a high-end School in India are
specifically recruited for their skills
you know they're going to be doctors and
technologists and Engineers of all kinds
so
isn't there a filtering issue going on
are we not getting the
you know cream of the crop from some
countries because of the way we set up
the immigration process whereas the
black Americans were
brought in on slave ships many of them
and
descended from that
so there's no filtering mechanism
at least that kind of filtering
mechanism
I think that's a good point
how many of you think that's not a valid
point from Kennedy that the immigration
filters differently from different
countries at different times that's
valid yeah you there are people actually
saying that that's not valid now keep in
mind I'm not saying that's the only
thing that's causing differential I'm
not saying it's the only thing but
there's no way that's not a valid point
come on
come on seriously
you don't you don't think that we have
different filters for different
countries
of who we let in and why
of course we do
you think you would get the same result
from Indian Americans who are flying
here
on airplanes
compared to people flowing across the
southern border which is basically
anybody with legs
so if you were to compare any two groups
one group is anybody who has legs
and the other group is people who can
figure out how to buy an airplane ticket
to get to America
there's no way those two are going to
have the same
income in 10 years
there's no way
all right
I I feel like when I say candy you just
want to disagree with them
you would be far more credible if you
allowed him the points that are clearly
obviously true which is the immigration
paths make a difference
as long as you don't accept all of his
points
I'm not saying except all of his points
that's just one good point it's just one
good point
I think we can I think we can agree to
that
now beyond that
I'm sure there's a cultural difference
that makes a difference
it feels like it but that's just
anecdotal
I don't have any science to support that
but it looks like it it looks like it so
from the outside our
poor powers of observation sure looks
like it I just don't have any scientific
evidence that would back that point
and I would definitely back candy for
saying that there are systemic racism
um in the school system for example that
would be my best example of it
so
all right
um so did you catch my theme of the day
every time we put men and women together
it's a problem for white men
and every time you put black people and
white men together it's a problem for
white men
okay not every time you know every every
time I say every time you shouldn't
believe every time that's obvious
hyperbole
so all of this is obvious hyperbole when
when you double cancel before it it's
probably going to happen probably going
to get double triple canceled today
but there is a real problem of people
working together now
there's a real problem it's actually
dangerous to be around other people
am I wrong it's actually dangerous to be
around other people
even if you think you're not breaking a
law you might think you're just being
yourself or you think oh I just tell the
truth that's my maybe what you think
about yourself but other people are like
oh I'm going to cancel you mofo I'm
going to get a little I'm going to get a
little dopamine hip from cancel you
I don't want to be around anybody who
gets a dopamine hair from canceling me
did you see aoc's Glee when Tucker
Carlson uh parted with Fox News like
watching her little video of how happy
she was I mean she was genuinely happy
that's a dopamine hit
don't be around anybody who would be
that happy if something bad happened to
you
is that good advice don't be around
somebody who would be happy and get a
dopamine charge
just for seeing something bad happening
to you
get away from that as far as you can
yeah
so all right that's my general theme men
and women were dangerous to each other
all right um
the uni party idea now I don't buy the
unit party idea I buy individuals doing
individual things and it sums up to
something that looks like a uniparty
well we definitely have a unit party
when it comes to war
so there's an argument on that
um
uh your kids have canceled you because
you're afraid of woke culture
all right
all right so here's something I'm no
longer going to entertain
please please do not ask me to comment
on people from different political
parties running as one party I'm not
going to comment on RFK Jr maybe being
on the ticket with Trump
just stop that's not going to happen
that is not worth talking about there's
any chance
all right
um
and uh so what else is going on
I continue to use AI with no success
whatsoever
has anybody used AI for anything
successful
where it saved you saved you time and
made you some money or something
yeah I've been looking so far it's just
extra work
I mean one assumes that the upside is
tremendous but nothing yet
all right
um charging higher fees for people with
good credit scores well the Democrats
are consistent in ignoring human
motivation
so the story about people with higher
credit having to pay extra to pay for
people with bad credit is one of those
stories the story about Elizabeth Warren
wants to pack the court as if the
Republicans won't repack it when they
take charge
all right it's a ridiculous idea
ridiculous
perfect idea but each of these
ridiculous ideas has the same problem it
ignores human motivation
if you ignore how humans are and how
they normally are and how they normally
act you cannot build a system
and that's consistently what the
Democrats do they ignore human
motivation
all right
um
using mid-journey for Film Production
right now well I'll bet you spend extra
time and don't get any extra benefit
from it
Democrats announced their 2024 nominee
okay Biden I guess
all right um
at Biden's current rate of decline
what do you expect by next year
is he going to be even a little bit
functional
and what it what do the Democrats do
about uh
about Tacoma
you know what would be interesting
if Trump just ran about ran against
Kamala
by just not mentioning Biden by saying
he's irrelevant
he could actually just say all right I'm
running for president against Kamala
Harris
and then people say no no Biden is the
top of the ticket and then you just look
at him and you go right
yeah that's funny
you actually he could just pretend Biden
isn't running
just imagine that imagine Trump running
for president
by simply acting or playing as though
Biden is not in the race and just say
Kamala Harris whenever whenever he talks
about their candidate just don't even
act like he's part of the process
say Joe Biden is babbling with his
dementia making some claims about
January 6 and the good people hoax he
can't tell a hoax from reality he's so
far out of it but uh looks like I'm
really running against Kamala Harris
so if you think Kamala Harris can do a
better job than me vote Democrats
so Susan Rice
resigned which is making people
speculate that she could be a vice
presidential running mate what do you
think of that
that does sound like
does that sound likely
wouldn't Susan Rice be the Obama Handler
like the one that Obama would use to
handle
to handle my
so to me that doesn't sound crazy
if you were going to predict what
Democrats want to happen I think what
they want to happen is Susan Rice
to replace
Kamala but
ideally they'd like to replace Biden I
guess
all right
oh someone says that Susan Rice was not
left enough so she got pushed down for
not being left enough well not being
left enough might be a perfect vice
president
because you don't want somebody who's
two left
she's horrible for this country some
people say that Susan Rice I don't know
enough about her I don't really have a
is there a Susan Rice and a Condoleezza
Rice two Rices
what are the odds that there would be
two Rices
all right
she's just Obama as a woman
all right
well
could Obama transition and then run
again
um
interesting
no it would still be him though so
technically he would still be him so he
couldn't do it
all right I don't think I have anything
else left to say so we're gonna
end this conversation now for YouTube
YouTube thanks for joining
Let's uh fix the country tomorrow we'll
do that tomorrow
