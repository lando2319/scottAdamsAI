it'll be okay
settle down
[Laughter]
it will all be fined I promise
and if you'd like to take what might be
a bad day for some of you
if you'd like to uh make the best of it
well you came to the right place I'm
going to explain it all
and so you will go away from this uh
this encounter knowing exactly what went
wrong are you ready well if you'd like
to take it up to the highest level of
understanding all you need is a couple
of my girl glass of tanker Chelsea
starting the canteen trucker flaska
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine the other day the
thing makes
everything better
except the midterms it's called the
simultaneous but it happens now go
ah
yeah
two sniffs in an exhale
oh don't you feel better now
a little bit
all right I'm gonna lift your spirits
and make everything better
maybe we'll see
I don't know if you heard there was uh
an election last night
um I think Ben Shapiro
summed it up best in a tweet as he was
watching the uh
results come in
he said from Red Wave to Red Wedding
now if you don't watch Game of Thrones
that meant nothing to you
if you do watch Game of Thrones pretty
darn clever the Red Wedding was a bloody
massacre in that
um
can somebody confirm something for me
before I get ripped apart today I need I
need you to be my memory
I believe
I never predicted a red wave
is that true or do I have false memory
about my own performance go
true
mostly jerusal he says yeah
yeah I couldn't I couldn't remember if
there was any time I did
but my memory was never being confident
it was going to happen
I was never confident it was going to be
a red wave and I'll tell you why
because once again the persuasion filter
just sees things different than the fact
filter
so I was never feeling it
I never once felt a red wave like in my
bones
I saw the same thing you saw I saw the
experts I saw the polls I never really
felt it never really felt it
so I'm not surprised at all let me ask
you how many of you are surprised at the
result
I was completely open to this going
either way
yeah
yeah all right well we'll talk about all
of this
um
so let's see if we can learn from our
mistakes okay
let's be the only people in the internet
who can learn from our mistakes
and as I tweeted this morning if you
believe the experts
uh
uh the non-redway is a surprise right
any anybody who believed the experts was
surprised today
how have the experts done in the last
few years
what would you say have the experts been
nailing it bat in a thousand doing real
good
if you would bet against the experts on
literally everything how would you have
done
suppose you didn't even know what the
didn't even know what the issues were
you weren't paying attention to anything
and you just cast a bet against the
consensus of the experts just every time
on covid on Politics on the economy just
every time
how would you do
you you would have had a positive record
no it wouldn't be a CO it wouldn't be a
coin flip it would not be a coin flip
you would have probably a
I don't know two-thirds success rate two
and the three something like that yeah
following the experts is a terrible idea
lately
maybe the worst it's ever been I don't
know
um if you believe that facts are more
important than feelings how'd you do
how are the facts of how the country is
doing
and if you believe the facts said oh
there's all this crime and inflation in
the economy if you thought the facts
were going to tell you how the midterms
would come out how'd that go
didn't work at all did it
completely non-predictive right so
what was predictive was there anything
that people used to predict that was
predictive
well it turns out yes
yes it turns out that there was one
frame for looking at this situation that
was completely predictive
you're gonna hate this
you're gonna ate this
what demographic group caused the win
for the Democrats go what demographic
group caused the win
foreign
not white women not white women
it's women and it's not women it's young
women
right so young women of all types
um
who seem to be the dominant you know
Factor right
young women
um
have I ever told you what is the
strongest form of persuasion
what's the fear yeah there's nothing
that persuades more than fear because
fear you have to take care of first it's
like oh well I don't need lunch if I'm
going to be eaten by a lion
so first I'll run away from The Lion and
then I'll worry about lunch right now
lunch is essential
I mean eating's essential
but not as essential as surviving so you
can eat
so fear is number one and there's
nothing close
somebody said sex I'll agree with you
sex would be more persuasive than fear
even fear but it doesn't really enter
into politics
but you're right so that that was
actually a very insightful comment sex
would actually be more persuasive than
even fear you see yourself right people
have sex even when it's risky so yes
you're absolutely right if if sex had
been part of the question
like sexual relations not gender yeah it
would have made a difference but
politics it doesn't
um
all right so if fear is the most
important persuasion Factor let me ask
you this what demographic group
based on science not not bigotry
based on science not bigotry
what group is the most susceptible to
fear
what group is easiest to scare
yeah and this is not a sexist
comment
I had to go Google it because I didn't
know
and I just wondered if there was any
difference and you Google it and all of
the top results say the same thing yeah
there's a big difference
the the women's biology
is such that they're easier to scare
they have more fear
about things now that makes sense
doesn't it
you understand that like if I walk out
in public
um I've said this before and it's even a
little bit irrational I've never been
afraid of a person
isn't that weird
now I've been afraid of you know a gun
that the person had in their hands
unfortunately I've looked down the
barrel of a few guns I've been afraid of
that but if it's just the person
I'm not really afraid of somebody just
because they're big
right it's part of being male are you
are there any men
who are afraid of just being in public
because there are men who are bigger or
tougher looking that never even enters
my mind oh you are you are now I'm not
talking about going into a dangerous
neighborhood of course you shall be
fearful of that I'm talking about just
you get on the bus and there's some big
men on the bus
would that scare you if you're not as
big as them if you're male that wouldn't
scare me
I mean not even a little bit
but if you're a woman
do you have an actual risk you do yeah
it's an actual risk so it makes sense
biologically it's completely rational
that those who are you know less able to
inflict death on somebody would be more
afraid of other people
you know one of the benefits of being
male is that we can kill anybody
am I right
you could be bigger than me but I could
definitely kill you
right I might have to wait till you turn
around
I might have to wait till you go to
sleep but oh I could kill you
I could kill you right it was every man
could now women could kill you when you
fall asleep too it's just they're less
likely to do it
by the way I saw a story in the news
it was a woman who found nude pictures
on her boyfriend or husband I think it
was thinking of his husband and found
nude pictures of you know some young
looking hot woman on his computer and
she ended up stabbing him
she was so jealous she stabbed him
and later she found out that the nude
pictures on his computer were pictures
of his wife when she was thinner
so that was probably awkward later in
the evening when they sorted that all
out
talk about an awkward day wow
anyway so women can kill men too it's
just they need a reason
that was a reason she didn't kill him
though she just stabbed him a few times
um
so yes it is scientifically true that
young women who dominate the Democrat
Party are easier to scare
now
so so number one
since both sides are trying to scare
their own side mostly you're talking to
your own team right
so you've got one team of
dominated by older white men
are are men are older
white men easier or harder to scare than
the average person
older I'm not talking about elderly
necessarily I'm just you know older
mature older they're pretty hard to
scare right
yeah we're pretty hard to scare I'm in
that group we're pretty hard to scare
like actual scare you know we'll we'll
be concerned about things like anybody
would but it's kind of hard to scare us
and irrationally
so that is a that's a built-in Advantage
all right now I'm going to go one level
further
who is easier to scare
a man with high testosterone or low
go and this is not bigotry this is
science this this is only what science
will support there's no speculation
involved here
yeah Low T people are easier to scare
high tea people are braver
now they might be braver to the point of
stupidity uh let me be clear here I'm
not saying men are awesome in high
testosterone men are the best of all
there's no quality judgment happening
here I'm not I'm not trying to put
anybody down
I'm only talking pure science
and if you Google it which I did you'll
find that the higher your testosterone
the less fear you have
that's just sort of what that drug does
to you
right you put a little more testosterone
in you get a little braver it's one to
one
now let me ask you this
uh
does the Democrat Party have high T men
or low T men
on average
yeah
I feel like it is sort of low T men who
want to uh
who want to be popular with women
and they believe that women told them
the truth
that if they act sensitive they'll like
them better
do you know I I believe that for like 20
years
that women have gaslighted me for almost
20 years when in my younger life
because I got raised in the you know the
feminist era
so the feminist said you know
to be a good male and not a piece of
 you should be in touch with your
feminine side
and you should be flexible and more and
more like a woman I mean you know you
don't have to be a woman but just be
more in touch with your feminine side
and that would make you a person that
people are really going to like
so yeah in in my younger days I thought
you know if I give women everything they
want
I'm in
just give them everything they asked for
yeah and it won't be easy but I'm the
kind of guy who's willing to do the
extra work
yeah I don't care that it's hard to get
there oh you tell me if the path is hard
but there's a good reward at the end
I'll still take that path because I'm
the kind of guy who will crawl through
broken glass to get what I want which is
true
basically I'm unstoppable if I really
want something
but I was gaslighted so badly that I
thought the way to crawl through grout
glass was to give women what they asked
for
oh my God was I stupid
oh my God
like it took me years to figure out that
was all a lie and none of that was like
how people work like it was just
completely off model for just anything
just reality did not conform to any of
that
right
your libido has ruled your life well of
course it has
am I supposed to apologize for that
if your libido ruled your life it might
not have worked out well
but I wouldn't apologize for it that is
literally how you were evolved you
evolved so your libido would take over
your brain
I don't apologize for that it's neither
good nor bad it's just how I evolved
right I didn't have anything to do with
the choices my ancestors made not my
fault
I just I just got here the way I got
here
all right
what is uh the most predictive element I
asked you what's the most persuasion
element what's the most predictive thing
in all the world
the most predictive thing
it never fails
seriously yeah money
follow the money works even when it
shouldn't
now the even when it shouldn't is the
part that I'm adding to the conversation
you've all heard follow the money blah
blah blah right follow the money is just
so obvious
there's nothing to say about it it's
just so obvious but what I'm having
and I'm adding this aggressively
is that follow the money works even when
there's no reason it should
like every part of your instinct says
not this time this time is not going to
be about the money because we have all
these other big issues there's you know
the the fate of the world you know it's
honor it's Integrity it's the fate of
the Democracy these are all so big it's
not about the money this time
and then it's always about the money
right
my understanding is that the Democrats
spent better on uh close races
is that confirmed
can can anybody confirm that from the
reporting today
I saw one of the pundits say that the
Democrat it was a republican who said it
a republican said that the Democrats
spent better
in the close races
so now you've got
two factors that predicted the Democrats
would do well
Factor one fear is the biggest
uh persuasion thing
but here's the next thing all right
here's the next Quiz
which is more persuasive
uh I will give you something you want
or
I will take from you something you value
which one which one forms action more
I'll give you something you asked for
or I'll take from you something you
value
not even close
not even close
if you're going to take something you've
got to fight
you got to fight on your hands if you're
taken right you don't take
we're not a species that evolved to give
up stuff
you know we like stuff but there's lots
of stuff we like and we're also used to
not getting what we like right we're
very used to not getting everything we
like but man if I've got something and
you try to take it away from me
suddenly it's the most important thing
in my life you're not taking my
right
so what did the Republicans say they
would do for the Democrat women
they said they'd take their
elect us and we'll take away your rights
that's how they heard it
right because abortion
now I'm not I'm not speaking for or
against abortion so we're not talking
about the policy I'm only talking about
the persuasion
now a lot of people said that that
um
abortion was not why they were voting
a lot of people said like two or three
percent said that's why they voted but
two or three percent was the margin on
all the tight races wasn't it
two to three percent said abortion was
why they voted
you know they were kind of single issue
voters
two to three percent is all it takes
that's the whole game
I I mean you could easily make a story
that abortion is the only thing that
mattered
at the same time the news is saying the
opposite they're saying that only two to
three percent said it mattered so it
didn't matter
isn't that upside down if two to three
percent actually voted because of it
that's the whole race
so I don't know I mean I think that
one's still a little bit Gray
but you gotta you gotta at least wonder
if that mattered all right what is
something else that uh the Republicans
were going to take away from the
Democrats go
what were the Democrats afraid of losing
besides abortion
democracy
democracy
yep
they thought they were going to lose
democracy
now
doesn't that sound ridiculous
if you don't believe democracy was at
risk
that doesn't even register as you as a
thing does it if you're a Republican and
you know the January 6th stuff was all
not even once did you think that
democracy was at risk did you so you
didn't take that seriously did you
ever I didn't every time I heard it I'd
be like okay that's nobody's going to
take that seriously but I was sort of in
my bubble wasn't I
how many people would it take to take
that seriously before the the red wave
goes away
not many
if if five percent of Democrats believed
they were going to lose the thing they
valued the most
Freedom democracy
it would only take five percent of them
to be afraid that they were literally
going to lose it
do you think that five percent of the
Low T men who are Democrats were
literally afraid of losing democracy
I do
I do
I don't think most of them were
seriously afraid about five percent yeah
absolutely do you think that five
percent of Republicans
who had some fear of like losing a thing
I don't think so
I think they all thought they were going
to get something Republicans all went
into the midterm thinking yeah we're
getting stuff
but they weren't afraid of losing stuff
were they
now you could say yeah inflation
you know losing their guns but gun
control wasn't even an issue was it gun
control just disappeared as an issue
if the Democrats had pushed gun control
as their number one issue what would
have happened
they were lost
bigger yeah because that would be taking
something away from Republicans what
happens when you say we're going to take
something away from Republicans
they'll do anything to stop it because
nobody wants to lose what they have
right
right so
correct me if I'm wrong if you look at
the demographics of the two groups you
can see that fear would
be more effective in one group and fear
is the most important persuasion
did the Democrats try to activate that
fear
did they tell you you're losing your
democracy you're losing your freedom of
your bodily autonomy yeah they did
you as a republican take any of that
seriously because you thought that's not
going to work
probably you didn't take it too
seriously
but that's because you didn't believe it
right
they actually believed
they were going to lose these things now
abortion's kind of a gray area because
the states get to decide so maybe nobody
will lose anything at least in terms of
the majority
but certainly they had the feeling that
they lost something right if you're a
Democrat it doesn't matter that it's up
to the states they can't feel that what
they feel is it's harder to get an
abortion they feel that they lost
something
yeah and the January 6th thing probably
did make it a little bit credible that
they could lose their democracy
um here's a big hidden Danger
the polls the polls were unreliable
right so the polls before the election
didn't get it right
what is more dangerous than the polls
not agreeing with the outcomes of
Elections
that is like the most dangerous
situation isn't it because you've got
people who are wondering about the
credibility of the election
and at this point you know we're happy
that Justice is blind
we like it that Justice you know isn't
the bigot Justice is blind
but now we have democracy as blind
democracy is blind because we don't have
a system where we know what happens when
the vote gets into the computers it's a
little bit blind there but now we're
blind because the polls don't even tell
you okay if the outcome in the polls
were close
probably was a fair election
but what if they're not close
what if the polls say oh it's going to
be a red wave and then the actuality is
nothing even close
at that point it's easy to rig elections
because the public doesn't expect the
polls and the outcomes to match
the moment the public doesn't doesn't
think polls and outcomes should match
because they've seen enough examples
where they don't kind of like a weather
report right well you don't really
expect the weather forecast for next
week
to be necessarily accurate you know
might be better than 50 but you know
your expectations are not that high
well
the good news
and
um I see on Twitter just the smallest
amount of quibbling about you know some
election Integrity stuff
you know mostly just about Arizona
Maricopa but I think Maricopa is the
closest watched
you know election segment in the whole
country
uh because especially because they had
problems so I think there are plenty of
people watching it and however that
turns out it doesn't it doesn't affect
most of the results one way or the other
um
but we survived and it looks like
um we're not going to have a huge
election Integrity problem would you say
as of today does it look like there
won't be any major risks to the
democracy
so far
yeah
all right now here are the uh reasons
you're going to hear in the regular uh
pundit Press today
everybody's going to have to tell you
why the results didn't come out the way
you thought
some people are going to say the quality
of the candidate mattered
but does the quality of the candidate
matter every time
I would argue that the quality of the
candidate matters only if everything
else doesn't
right the quality of the candidate
matters
only if everything else doesn't matter
so if you're if the control of the
Congress is at risk
then the quality of the candidate
doesn't make any difference at all
none when when the Democrats needed to
get Trump out of office did the quality
of the candidate matter nope didn't
matter at all
so everybody who says the quality of the
candidate matters
they're right unless there's some other
thing that matters more now so which
makes it almost worthless right isn't
the Yogi Berra famous saying
uh good pitching beats good hitting and
vice versa
is is that Yogi Bear or somebody else
but the the thinking is
that and let me say that again
a good candidate
can overcome almost any situation you
know that's what Trump did he was a good
candidate in the first election
right but more money can overcome any
candidate
so there's an amount of money that can
overcome any candidate but there's also
a quality of a candidate that could
overcome almost any money
so when you see the pundit say well it's
the candidate that matters
the little recording in your head should
say
unless it's a close race and Congress is
up for you know unless there's a lot of
money you know blah blah blah blah yeah
and also depends who you're running
against right would fetterman have won
against a more traditional
candidate than Oz
didn't get Oprah's endorsement
now do you think that Oprah uh makes a
difference when she makes an endorsement
how much do endorsements normally matter
sometimes they matter a little
but I feel like their Oprah endorsement
is like might be the only one that
matters from a celebrity
remember Oprah can sell books
do you know who else can sell books by
recommending them almost nobody
almost nobody if anybody else could sell
books like she does they'd all be doing
it because that would give you some
power or you could get some you know
benefits from the books that are sold
Etc but Oprah has an unusual ability to
move her own audience
and her own audience is who
who is the audience for Oprah
weapons women
and probably younger ones
I don't know if it's younger ones but
might be
all right
um
see I think Oprah actually mattered
um I literally don't care who won
I know you don't want to hear that I
don't care at all and I told you that in
advance you know why right I'm a one
issue voter
and nobody had a fentanyl plan that was
good you know some of them were you know
tighten up the Border but that's just
basic stuff that's something you need to
do
it doesn't get anywhere close to
stopping Fentanyl
so if the Republicans don't have a
anti-fental plan and the Democrats don't
I don't give a which one of them
won
don't care at all honestly don't
um
but I'd like to give a shout out to
Twitter user Dodger Dave
Dodger Dave I know he follows me on
Twitter but I don't know if you're
watching this but Dodger Dave reported
on Twitter today that he's been off of
fentanyl for one year
one year today
so if anybody uh would like to
congratulate him on Twitter
please do he's going to need all the
help he get that he can get
um but
this is a real accomplishment by the way
yeah when you're somebody like you know
he overcame odds to run for Senate and
you won the Senate you're like hey
that's a that's a strong person there
you know Kerry Lake there's a strong
person she's overcoming odds to you know
maybe when we don't know yet but none of
that comes close to Dodger Dave
Dodger Dave got off Fentanyl
this is the strongest guy you know
right like I wouldn't want to be in a
fight with Dodger Dave
I wouldn't want to be in a contest with
Dodger Dave where whoever could take the
most pain was going to win the contest
Dodger Dave's got the goods all right so
he made it a year so keep going
um Trump made a joke in a third of the
country either pretended they didn't get
it or wanted to act like they don't or
don't know what a joke is so prior to
the election
Trump was asked if he would take you
know credit for his candidates he
endorsed winning yes they did and he
said quote with a smile so you have to
understand he said this with a clear
smile that says I'm joking
and he said well I think if they win
meaning his candidates if they win I
should get all the credit
if they lose I should not be blamed at
all
and then later he you know he
confirmed the point that everybody acts
that way you know everybody acts that
they take credit when they win and they
take no responsibility when they lose
and he made the point that that's what
everybody does
right but what he first answered it
about himself
what did the Democrats say
oh my God
the ego on that man
the narcissism of them in that if he
wins he takes credit but if he doesn't
win he doesn't take credit my God the
ego The Narcissist everything we thought
about him was right
to which I say
he was mocking his own ego
that was the joke the joke was he was
making fun of himself that he would take
credit for something that clearly you
know might be a random occurrence
that was obviously making fun of his own
narcissism
and they couldn't tell the difference
or they pretend they couldn't but I saw
a lot of comments where it really looked
like they couldn't tell the difference
they actually thought that was
narcissism I've argued with you before
that
he's he might be closer to the opposite
because he puts his ego out there where
it's just trashed every day by his
critics most people couldn't handle that
but he kept so apparently he's got some
kind of control over his ego where he
can mock himself
and he can still make the joke after the
fact you know if his people had won he
would have taken full credit
and he would have done it with a smile
and and those who knew him would have
known oh he doesn't mean it or or maybe
he does a little bit but but he knows
he's having fun with it right you would
know he was having fun with it
somebody says but your record not good
well your records not good you talking
about me
anybody who tells me my prediction
record is not good means that they only
know about some of my predictions
generally that's all it means
um I don't even know if my record is
good but I know that the people who say
it's bad are never aware of my actual
record
um Mike cernovich
said this on Twitter today after the
results are mostly in he said Trump has
zero shot at 2024 General after tonight
this is enough for debate uh I was
around in 2015 when he had quote no
chance and accurately said he'd win true
statement
and he threw the biggest inauguration
event in 2017 but he says times change
or or he changed or whatever but it's
you know time to move on
um
[Applause]
what do you think let me let me pull you
before I give you my opinion uh does
Trump now have zero chance of winning
because his he met he's going to get
blamed for the midterms because he he
promoted some candidates that lost and
maybe it was their loyalty to him that
was his main consideration
and that's how it's going to be
interpreted
a lot of people saying zero
okay now everybody who's at zero hold on
for a second hold your answers for a
second so everybody who says zero
who would you vote for if he's running
against a Democrat
who would you vote for
would you not vote for him because you'd
vote for the Democrat
how many of you will now vote for the
Democrat no matter who it is if Trump is
the other one
nobody nobody yeah everybody who says
Trump has zero chance
totally wrong you're totally wrong
yeah
now
I don't normally disagree with Mike
cernovich
you've probably noticed that right I'm
going to agree with him most of the time
but one thing one thing you need to know
about him is he's one of the strongest
persuaders
in the country
right his persuasion game his actual
technical knowledge of how to do it is
one of the best in the country
so in the in the political context
he's persuading as well as giving you
his opinion and sometimes it's more
persuasion and sometimes it's more
opinion
it's a little hard to know
with people who are good at it it's a
little hard to know exactly when they're
doing what
but
um I think this is more persuasion than
prediction
would you agree
because two years is a long time
do you know it's a long time
a week
everything you know about everything
could be done could be wrong in a week
am I right everything we knew about the
midterms was wrong today
in 24 hours everything you knew about
politics changed am I right
everything you knew about politics just
changed in one day
so if you say that Trump can't win based
on what's happening today
I think that ignores the the function of
time
and what we've observed for quite a
while now which is things can change
radically and quickly and you know you
don't you don't predict it so so yes he
could win
all right now here's the second question
can win doesn't mean will win right can
mean does not mean will
if if DeSantis primaried him
which I'm not going to predict I don't
predict it I don't rule it out but I
don't predict it so remember I said that
I don't rule it out but I don't predict
it that's that's a hard one because you
could imagine DeSantis getting enough
pressure
that even if he had decided not to maybe
he could change his mind you know good
of the country it's the right time sort
of thing
but do you think he could primary uh
Trump successfully go
who would win in the primary dissentis
or Trump
DeSantis or Trump in the primaries
most of you are saying Trump
it looks like about two-thirds or more
saying Trump now it's evening out
I'm just it's hard to tell just by the
answers all right so it's mixed it's
mixed uh here's the answer
they both could win
yeah I think that was not as obvious as
anybody thinks they both could win
the way that uh DeSantis could win
is to say I'm Trump without the uh the
bad parts
and then it's just over
that it's just over
now I'm not saying that's a true
statement or that you should believe it
because Trump does have them some things
which are unmatchable right Trump is a
little unmatchable in some categories of
of things but if that if that was the
pitch
if DeSantis says look I'll give you all
the good of trump but without the
downside
I think he just walks to the nomination
I think if he played it that way
he just walks into the nomination
honestly I don't even think it would be
close
but I don't think he would play it that
way
I think you'd play it more traditionally
and then it's anybody's guess
he already is
yeah and the fact that our their
elections are always close
this was really that probably this was
the greatest
um affirmation of democracy that I've
ever seen
would you agree
I I feel like yeah that our our system
just totally showed itself as strong
and once again
you know big uh big uh Applause for the
founders who hundreds of years ago built
a system to last the test of time
and it did
so far so good
I I think that our our Republic is the
strongest it's been
in a long time like right today
this is actually a really really
positive thing because not only did the
Republicans uh find some humility
but I think everybody did
that the the one thing that everybody
needed both the Republicans and
Democrats and Scott needs this too
and all of the public all the pundits
right so I'm in this category I'm going
to criticize you know what we all needed
there's one thing we all needed
a big old dose of humility
that's what we all needed right we all
needed to be a little bit wrong and just
have it slapped in our faces right so
everybody got to be a little bit wrong
on this one here's how the Democrats are
wrong
the strongest governors
one one easily
right the governors who who handle
things like Republicans and had real
plans and you know real
like solid policy things
DeSantis being one Abbott being another
I guess
what's his name in Georgia
Georgia Governor is a camp yeah so those
three governors are being held out as
um good models
so if you're if you're a Democrat you
look at those three governors and you
say oh
and young young kids another example
yeah four Governors let's say you would
look at those governors and say oh every
time somebody acts like a good
Republican they win big
how about that
the people who actually act like real
Republicans
not crazy Republicans you're not extreme
Republicans not not Marjorie Taylor
green I'm not criticizing her I'm just
saying that she's she's in that way
right
so if you're a Democrat you need to have
some humility that when a republican
acts like a Republican
without the crazy
they win hard
right
being a just a normal capable Republican
governor and you don't just win you you
win with
like a punch
it's like a win plus it's not even close
but then you throw the crazy in and
what happens
not so easy right you throw in Dr Oz
and he's not exactly a traditional
Republican is he you're not quite sure
what you're getting there because it's a
little mix of stuff
um a mix you know his background has
some sketchy stuff according to people
what's crazy about Oz is some of his uh
let's say uh things he's promoted in his
entertainment career now I don't
necessarily think that should haunt him
because that's a different kind of job
but it is I think it does I think it I
think it leads to the not serious
feeling you look at DeSantis and you do
you say he's serious or not serious
DeSantis is as serious as a heart attack
you look at Abbott is AVID a serious
politician or not so he's serious
that's a serious guy right
uh right those are serious people but
you look at Oz and as serious as he may
be about politics at the moment you
don't get the same feeling about him
right it feels a little more
opportunistic would you say a little
opportunistic which is nothing wrong
with that by the way if you're not
opportunistic why aren't you you should
all be opportunistic you know that's our
system play it play it the way it was
designed be opportunistic but it might
not look good
might not look good as a look
yeah uh is masters
done or does he still have a chance with
what's uncounted is Blake Masters done
that race hasn't been called to you
right because there's still some small
chance that the remaining votes go his
way
small chance not looking good
all right
um
do you think that uh
do you think that Trump made the quality
of candidates not matter
I think a little bit he did
and what I mean by that is uh the
what Trump did
was maybe solidify the team play aspect
more than anybody else did
you could imagine or you know 20 years
ago you could imagine a Republican or a
Democrat just voting for the other team
because they like that candidate it's
easy to imagine a Democrat voting for
Reagan right
that's pretty easy to imagine and it
worked
but Trump came in and he basically you
know made it a blood War
so so being on the side of the the blood
enemy that doesn't work the same
right Reagan liked everybody and so it
was okay to be on his team even if he
didn't like 100 of what he was doing
Trump is so polarizing that I think
people just voted for their team
so I think that the the team play nature
of things just eliminated the quality of
the candidate except
remember you know good pitching beats
good hitting and vice versa
except where the candidate was so strong
like the Republican Governors we
mentioned where the candidate was so
strong that nothing else mattered and
people said oh okay I can get beyond
that
all right
um
uh Rasmussen
um said that uh 25 of the people they
polled say that the the late results
that make them more confident that the
election is fair
25 yeah so 25 say that when you don't
immediately have a result like every
country in the world can do that that
that's probably an indicator that things
are more
secure than you thought
25 percent
sometimes that's called like one quarter
oh
and why does that number keep popping up
anyway
here's the uh most uh unexpected but not
really
story of the day that has nothing to do
with this but we'll get back to it
uh remember Alan dershowitz was accused
by one of the Epstein
victim young women
and the the victim young woman who has
been accusing dershowitz of sexual
impropriety four years
today recanted her accusation
she she fully recanted her accusation
what yeah exactly exactly yeah I'm
watching the comments over locals and
the people are like what
what
the
now
does recanting your accusation mean that
it wasn't true
it doesn't right it doesn't
doesn't mean it wasn't true
but I'm going to Pat myself on the back
for something if you don't mind
all right when many of you were
basically saying you know dershowitz is
dead to you because of those accusations
um I said
I said
he has an unusually strong defense and
you better wait
you better wait on this one
because he's not hedging he wouldn't
write at it he went at it like a maniac
do you know how he defended himself
he defended himself like an innocent
person
now remember he's smart enough to know
how to play it psychologically and leave
the right impression but he defended
himself like an innocent person
and and the claims that he made in his
defense
sounded so
so weak that they they actually sounded
real
you know what I mean like if you made up
a defense it might sound a little
stronger but he had that yeah she did
give me a massage but I left my
Underpants off
and you're saying that's not like the
strongest defense
but that's actually why it sounded real
to me it sounded real to me because who
would say that
that's like the better defense would be
we didn't have a massage
right if you're just gonna lie
you know maybe you'd lie differently now
none of that says he was innocent
so let me be clear
I don't know I have no idea who did
anything but I'll tell you dershowitz is
the person who fights for your ability
to be innocent until proven guilty
that's who he is he fights for your
ability to be innocent until proven
guilty so I I returned the favor
I returned the favor
again has nothing to do with any
knowledge I would have about who did or
did not do anything how would I know
but in our system
in our system I'm going to favor the
system over the individual results
because you got to keep the system
strong and this was one of those
innocent until proven guilty things that
I was kind of a Maniac about honestly
like I didn't know which way it would go
but I'm a total Maniac about the guy who
helps keep your ability to be innocent
until proven guilty that's who he is and
he's very consistent about that always
has been so I respect that and I return
the favor which has nothing to do with
any other thing he may or may not do
done it's just about the system
so
um I hope I hope I hope this is the
right outcome
I hope
but it's another reminder that
everything you think is true
no matter how sure you are that is true
you don't really know
don't really know
um I gave a warning last night that I
thought was going to be important but
maybe it isn't which is the same morning
I gave at 2020 which is everything you
hear about maybe there's some
impropriety in the election
that 95 percent of it at least at least
95 percent of it would be total
I'm still at that number
yeah because we you've heard some things
like oh what about this what about that
I think it's all so far
which is not to say
there's no cheating I would never say
that there's just no way to know but
what you hear the things that go
surfaced are 95 so if if you
hear something that sounds really really
credible about some election shenanigans
it might be true but that shouldn't be
your assumption you should start with
the Assumption very unlikely
but be open to the possibility be open
to the possibility just don't believe in
any Krakens like I did don't be a don't
be a kraken believer
be a kraken denier until until it's
proven
all right but it looks like there isn't
so far I'm not seeing a lot of claims of
fraud am am I looking in the wrong
places
is there anybody on television who's
claiming fraud has Trump has Trump
weighed in and said the election was
rigged
because Trump would have already said
something would they because they're
going to ask him Trump's going to be
asked so somebody Carrie lake is saying
something is suspicious uh I don't know
what she's saying but here's what I'll
bet without even knowing what she's
saying I'll bet
what she's saying is you know we need to
be careful and take a look at this
I'll bet she's not saying it's
definitely rigged
because she would be way too smart to
say that right
confirm that she's way too smart to say
the election is rigged
she is definitely smart enough to say we
need to take a look at why things didn't
go as planned and that's important you
know the election was kind of you know
botched
right yeah so if she says the election
was botched
that's right
if she says she got cheated on the
victory
that would be too far
with what the information we have
um
all right
um
so
here are all the different things you're
going to hear from the pundits who got
everything wrong up to this point
they're going to say the good candidates
won they're going to say spending was
the difference the somebody say cheating
I suppose some might say the rule
changes some might say
um
the GOP had no Solutions
did you notice that the GOP didn't have
Solutions
well it turns out they did they had this
whole commitment to America thing today
let me tell you what I remember from
reading the commitment to America
and now I'm done
those are all the things I remember from
my reading of the commitment to America
do you know when I learned that there's
a commitment to America document
I learned that after the election
all I do is watch the news
that's all I do is watch the
news all day I didn't know
I didn't know the Republicans had a
written plan did you
yeah first year hearing of it
now I feel like like I have this vague
memory
that Rick Scott had something but it was
different from what the Republicans had
as sort of a platformy thing but I just
thought it was something generic
platformy thing I didn't think it was
anything serious
Fox talks about it all the time
do they
I haven't heard any details what were
the details
uh refund police I don't know so
my uh well here's one of my blind spots
I had until right before the election I
I sort of tuned into this on Election
Day but not soon enough
uh that the Republicans were not giving
a positive story
they were sort of assuming that you knew
that they did a better job
and because you could see that things
were bad under the Democrats but I guess
people were not making the leap from
things are bad to Republicans have a
better idea
I think they do have a better idea but
they didn't make the argument
yeah and Rick Scott made them afraid
that Social Security was on the on the
line right now whether it was or not it
was enough to get them afraid of it so
what is the biggest persuasion fear
Who had who had the better fear of
persuasion the Democrats said
um
was it uh really about Trump
how much of the election was really
about getting rid of all Trump
supporters it makes sure there's you
know less chance that Trump would get
elected
probably some of it
I I think I think people's minds are
framed by Trump so that you can't not
consider him it's impossible not to
consider it
uh how about uh the mega mega extremist
claim made by Biden did it work
the mega mega they're all extremists and
and Marjorie Taylor green and you know
those are the ones you have to watch out
for
I thought it wouldn't
because it wasn't working on me
like when I hear blah blah extremists I
go blah blah blah I don't even care but
remember the Democrats the demographic
that is more Democrat is younger women
and as we discussed in case you missed
it science says very clearly that women
are easier to scare they're easier to
frighten
so
do you think that women were afraid of
losing democracy and
um the mega mega extremists and they'd
lose their bodily autonomy and stuff
probably yes
and the Low T males again this is not a
judgment statement I'm not saying
there's something wrong with you because
you have lower testosterone it's just
different
and but those differences do translate
into you know mental States and actions
uh how about uh apparently the Democrats
are getting credit for their uh crazy
sounding strategy of boosting the worst
candidates on the Republican side
so that the primaries were won by the
work the worst you know extremists and
then they lost their elections
apparently that worked
is that what happened
is it did that happen with Oz
was I was backed by the secret dark
Democrat money
yeah Marjorie Taylor Greene won as did
probably a lot of the people who AOC and
the squad all won by big numbers too the
the people were in safe districts all
one
that has just more to do with the
district
um
how about uh do you think the GOP stayed
home because they thought they were
going to win
what do you think of the theory that
Republicans didn't turn out because they
were confident of winning
I don't feel that
I don't feel it
yeah it's possible I could be persuaded
but
that wasn't the energy I was picking up
I was picking up
Republicans vote for fun
and for a principal
Republicans don't vote or not vote
because it's convenient
am I right
in fact you could Define Republicans as
people who are going to vote no matter
how hard you make it they're gonna
 vote because it's important it's
a principle
right
um
I don't know if it's the same on both
sides it might be but I don't see
Republicans staying home because it
rained
yeah maybe
all right
um the best predictors in my opinion
were follow the money
and persuasion of fear
the persuasion of losing something
abortion rights bodily autonomy you know
losing your democracy those those were a
good good
approaches by the Democrats it turns out
um and it was it was a little bit
invisible to me
because that persuasion wasn't intended
for me
and it didn't work on me so I was a
little bit
um I was blinded by the fact it was
designed for a certain demographic and
it worked it worked on that demographic
I think
and then what about The High Ground
maneuver that's that's the fourth thing
that I talk about all the time which you
you can never lose
if you take The High Ground
you win every conversation I'll give you
an example we should do a no we should
do B and then somebody else in the
meeting says can we test both of those
things cheaply
and both the people go yes
and then the smart person says well why
don't we just test both of them and
we'll do the one that works better
That's The High Ground once you hear it
you just stop arguing because you would
sound like an idiot after you heard of
The High Ground right was there any High
Ground
did anybody have The High Ground in this
election
well maybe a little bit
maybe a little bit because I think The
High Ground was protect the democracy
it was
but it does sound like the bigger
principle doesn't it
if I gave you a choice to get exactly
the right candidates you want
but you might lose democracy itself
that's not a good deal for me right so
preserving the system actually is a
pretty good high ground
and the Democrats have it they actually
had The High Ground
weirdly the low ground was I might get
mugged on the street
right I might get mugged on the street
is real that's like freaking real that's
a real immediate personal local fear
but it's also not The High Ground
it isn't The High Ground is the whole
country that's just bigger than your
little problem on the street
so the Democrats have that they have The
High Ground and uh January 6 was
probably the key to to holding that now
again I was a little bit blind to that
because it didn't work on me
right so that's the persuasion you miss
when it doesn't work on you personally
it was easier to see Trump coming
because his persuasion was working on me
you know what I mean if you can feel it
it's easy to call it out but I miss this
completely
um Maricopa County what went wrong so
the information we're getting is sketchy
as hell which is that some of the
machines were crashing some of the time
because they couldn't handle the type of
ink that was used on the ballots
how many questions does that raise
question number one
you don't test the actual ballots with
the actual machines before the election
or do you just test a few
and testing a few wouldn't have picked
up these errors
did they test the actual ballots
or was there you know some production
problem that they have to use you know
cheaping for the for some of them
I don't know so those are big questions
we'll find out
but
could you game the system
by giving some people ballots that had
intentionally weak ink and giving the
people that you knew would vote your way
Bellas they had the proper rink
could somebody game the system that way
could you take legal ballots and replace
them with weak Inc ballots could you if
you were the printer if you were the
printer of these ballots could you make
two batches of ballots one that you sent
to predominantly Democrat areas and one
two predominantly Republican areas
I don't know you could
but
here's the sketchiest part I heard about
it
the technicians visited all the machines
it's now on Election Day you've got
people inside the election machines
okay there are people inside the
election machines on Election Day that
makes you feel comfortable doesn't it
now I'm hoping that they have systems
and processes to protect that very thing
because you would expect on Election Day
would be the day you would have the most
technicians and the most machines for
just ordinary reasons right so they must
have some way to protect against the
obvious danger of having anybody in the
machine I don't know what it is but I'm
hoping they have a process so probably
that wasn't a problem
probably not
but
does it raise any suspicion
that they could tweak individual
machines to a higher state of
sensitivity and then they would work
wait a minute
if so if all of the machines were made
the same
but only some of them needed to be
tweaked
doesn't that mean that they were not the
same machines
that they were they had different
settings
because if the hardware is the same and
the software is not the same and the
only thing they changed was a setting
that means they weren't using the same
machines
and that means
I'm very curious if the ones that didn't
have the right setting
were in one kind of District versus
another
or one Precinct versus another
somebody says it's not the tabulators it
was the printers
not the tabulators but the printers so
is the system that when you vote it
prints out your vote and then they take
that printed vote and put it in a
tabulator
is that what's happening
somebody says yes
however
was it the printer they adjusted or the
tabulators
what got it what got adjusted the
tabulators or the printers
the printers
so somebody tabulous somebody changed
the printer so they printed properly
but it's the printer on the voting
machine
right
if that if the vote gets printed out by
the voting machine it's the voting
machine itself that's rating the or
that's the problem right
okay I guess we have a whole bunch of
questions
so I I don't have enough detail to go
much further but let me make the general
point
so whether it was the printers
or the printer on the voting machine
or the election machine counter no
matter what it was
no matter what it was the intention was
they were all the same right
the intention was everybody had the same
equipment
how can some of that equipment act
differently
how is that possible
well one way would be if somebody put
Bad Ink or not enough ink in some of the
printers
that would actually be a pretty you know
normal reasonable thing some of them
just add Bad Ink or bad printers but it
could be the same printer just some of
them weren't good
uh listen to the printer expert uh who's
the printer expert
you have no standing to find out what
happened yeah yeah maybe maybe there'll
be no standing from a legal sense so
there's no way to find out
all right all all I'm saying is
they have not eliminated the possibility
of shenanigans would you agree with that
that what we know so far
has not eliminated Shenanigans from the
possibilities set but there's but would
you agree with the second part
if the problem is the printers were not
printing
um
let's say the same
doesn't that sound like a normal problem
like you know the whole thing is
explained
if all it is is that printers don't
print the same everywhere that's
everything we already know every one of
you has a printer problem
yeah but then the question would be this
why do we never have this problem before
why do we never have this problem before
first time
Evan we always use printers and printers
suddenly went from functional to
non-functional and why did they only
become non-functional in the most
important County
all the other printers everywhere were
fine
just this one very important County
had some bad printers in it a lot of
them a lot of them got a lot of bad
printers in there
so here's here's what I believe
I believe we're still in the fog of War
so the the one thing we can all say
about Maricopa is we don't know what
happened would you agree with that
we don't have enough information
so the first thing we know is we don't
have enough information the second thing
we know is there is a perfectly normal
explanation for what we're seeing
doesn't mean it's true
but it's perfectly normal
yeah there was a problem with some
printers in one area
I mean that feels like something they
could explain with normal stuff again we
have questions why just this one area
why didn't we ever have this problem
before good questions but I wouldn't be
surprised if they could be answered
it could be as easy as
let me just give you an example it could
be easy as there's a procedure to put in
a new ink cartridge before you start the
election
and in one place they didn't do it
they they did some testing and they
forgot to change the ink cartridges and
then when it got toward the end the ink
was light and then the reader didn't
pick it up but everyone else just
followed the procedure
so they just didn't have that problem
maybe now I'm not saying that's the
answer I'm saying that it would be real
easy to imagine a very normal human
error situation
right
well but here's the thing
um
you could also determine whether it was
a mistake that would favor one side
but if the problem was simply that some
machines didn't work could you know that
would favor one side
good could you be confident that your
plan would work
I don't know these are questions we must
we must get to the bottom of
um
but I don't think the country is up in
arms I feel like Maricopa no matter what
happens there maybe we learned something
maybe we get smarter but it's not like
the end of the Democracy no matter what
happens
um
and let's see
that ladies and gentlemen
is I believe the most useful and best
live stream you're going to see today
about the election
now if you would like to track my
influence on the world
watch how the election results are
covered today now I have the advantage
of being able to go early in the day
so sometimes you know if I just say the
obvious thing
other people will also say the obvious
thing but it's not because of me
people are everybody's going to say the
obvious stuff so they're not copying me
if they say obvious stuff but
if you hear people talking about uh the
demographic difference
the fear persuasion you're taking
something away persuasion
or those things then maybe maybe that
was my influence
all right
um all of the pundits and news people
today are going to be struggling to say
something new
I just achieved that
see if anybody else does
so there's your challenge for the day so
this this is this is my pitch to you for
why you should watch my live stream it
is my contention that I I gave you a
take which you won't hear anywhere else
unless they were influenced by me
and I think that's what I had I add the
take you haven't heard somewhere else
which is not crazy by the way how did
you like my take
I guess I'll just ask you how you liked
it what do you think of my take that I
was blinded to the persuasion
for all the obvious reasons I'm not the
target of it
and and because I'm not the target
that's not a good excuse
because I do know enough about
persuasion I should have seen it
I should have picked that up
honestly but I think maybe I was picking
it up subconsciously because remember I
was very unique in not having a
prediction about a red wave
is there anybody else who is notable in
the prediction world
who also did not predict a red wave
sticks sticks and Hammer
is that true
nay silver but his was based on data
Michael Moore
yep
interesting all right let me ask you
this did Michael Moore do it again
I don't know if he was right on his
reason because I think he thought uh
I think he thought abortion was going to
be the like a driving thing but he might
have been right about that he might have
been right that that two or three
percent was all it took
uh are you admitting you are lacking in
Persuasion analysis in this case I
missed the signals yes but
but I don't think I missed them enough
that I made the wrong prediction
I I knew to not predict because there
was just something about this situation
that wasn't
I I couldn't put my finger on it just
wasn't something working but now after
the fact
it's it's a little clearer after the
fact you know you're you're analysis
could be a little bit better
um
but I would ask you this every time
somebody is this wrong
can you you know adjust to you believe
in the future
right if I had told you there was a red
wave
I would be pretty embarrassed today
and I would I would probably have to
tell you honestly that you should
discount what I predict in the future
but the fact that I was one of the few
people who did not predict a red wave I
feel like you should take that into
consideration too
oh you're right I wouldn't be
embarrassed yeah yeah I I guess that was
hyperbole yeah I don't really get
embarrassed by anything
but you get the point I would have been
wrong
um
yeah
all right even Jim cravers once right
once in a while somebody says
um
now let me let me ask you this
what happens if Carrie Lake loses
so that's still possible Right
or actually probable I think given her
current uh situation if she loses what
are the odds she wouldn't be the vice
president pick
for Trump
now he'd still have to get through the
primaries before that matters but what
are the odds
that that wouldn't happen
now
let me tell you a play that Trump could
do that he won't
but if Trump wanted to change his
reputation
from you know half of the country
thinking he's the worst thing that ever
happened to Earth
here's how we could do it
run for election with uh Carey Lake as
his vice president
win the election
and resign
win the election and resign
and then Trump
would give you
the first female president
and
and he would be George Washington
he would be George Washington
he would walk away from Power
after putting a woman in power
just think about it imagine him being
the person who put a woman in the
presidency his own decision nobody
else's his own personal nobody else in
the world decided he personally could
make her present
and then he does it
it'll never happen I agree it'll never
happen but
it's there
it's there
is free money
he could retire
as George Washington
people would people would go nuts the
heads would explode
now I agree with you the people who like
Trump like him because he's not like
that he's just always Trump
he's Trump today he's Trump tomorrow
will be Trump next week and that's part
of his appeal honestly so I don't think
he can do that
all right here's another way Trump could
easily win the election
but it also requires him to do something
Trump isn't going to do all right but
here's how easy it would be
you know I have to be honest I may have
pushed those vaccinations too hard
and I apologize for that
now
you can still say it's up to you I got
him I you know I did what I thought was
the best thing to do but I have to admit
that this didn't work out as well as I
thought
he he could actually just claim that
that didn't work out
the second thing he could do
is admit that he's getting people all
worked up about racism and and he wishes
he had
all he'd have to do to talk about border
and the immigration is just stop saying
they're sending their worst people
will you just stop saying that
like the first time you said it I feel
like it was good provocation
like it really you know brought all the
energy to him and they'd fight over
whether that was true or Hyperbole and
blah blah blah blah maybe it kind of
worked for him but at this point it just
looks racist
I don't think that's why he says it
but he has to know by now how it sounds
to the other team
all he'd have to do is say you know what
the people coming across the border are
are like a gift to this country
we should have more but we should do it
the right way
it's just so easy
I mean he could win everything just by
being
uncharacteristically humble
which isn't going to happen right but is
it I find it fascinating to know how
easily he could win everything
the the all he'd have to do
is just act normal for a while and even
if it's acting he knows how to act
so he could do it
yeah and and all the people who say I'll
never vote for him because of the thing
he did or the thing he didn't do it all
depends who he's running against
if he runs against a Democrat you're
going to be like ah damn it it's not my
first choice but I don't want that
Democrat over there so
if he gets in the race he could
definitely win the race I think getting
in the nomination would be the hard part
winning the race might be the easy part
in the end
but uh yes I would say this if Trump
acts exactly like he's always acted
he probably would lose to any Democrat
what do you say if Trump acts the way
he's always acted
he would lose to any Democrat because he
lost to Biden by acting that way
if you lose to Biden
whatever you did was the wrong thing to
do
but again what makes Trump trump is he
doesn't change and there there is value
in that there's value in knowing exactly
what you're going to get and I kind of
like that actually
but it doesn't work in this situation
right change is the only thing that
would get him
um elected only change and I don't think
that's on his menu
so there you go
but did he lose fairly I don't know
I'm going to say yes
because in my opinion uh cheating is
part of our election system and if the
Democrats haven't cheated the
Republicans and that made the difference
they won
they won because anybody who says that
the Republicans aren't trying to cheat
well you're just you're not a serious
person
somewhere there's a republican trying to
cheat somewhere
I don't know if there are more of them
or fewer of them than Democrats but
let's let's be adults it's a big country
with a lot of people in it somebody's
tried to cheat somewhere on both sides
uh uniparty Theory I don't discuss uni
party Theory because I don't take it
seriously
I I get the idea
that they end up being similar they all
want war
they all want to raise your taxes I get
that but I think it gets there
through a variety of ways you know
calling it The Unit party doesn't add
much to the analysis
will anybody primary Trump I think so
no you
I think Trump's going to have to get
through uh I hope so actually I hope so
I don't think I don't let me say this I
don't think Trump should be the nominate
and nominee without a primary
what would you say
because I think the Republicans need to
sort that out
don't they yeah normally you don't I
mean if he were a sitting president I'd
say no primary but given that he lost
and he lost to Biden
if you lose to Biden you have you have
to primary and if you're people you
recommended for the midterms
didn't work out you have to primary
now here's what's different today than
yesterday
if DeSantis and Sonny was going to
primary him you'd say well that's being
kind of a dick and maybe you're not
helping your party right
what would you say today
today it doesn't look like a dick move
today it looks like saving the party
right if DeSantis said he was going to
primary Trump he could say this is the
last thing I wanted to do
it's the last thing I wanted to do but
it's the only way to save the party
that's a really strong argument given
that the person he's primary just lost
to the worst candidate in the history of
candidates whose name wasn't fetterman
right
if I primary Trump I would just say this
he lost to Biden
and then they say but what policies are
you bringing and then I'd lean in and
say
he lost
to Biden
and then they say yes yes yes but what
are you going to do with taxes and
Ukraine and then I'd lean in and say
he lost the Biden and I I'm not even
going to give any more argument
honestly
he lost to Biden
right no whatever you want to say about
the you know propriety of the election
and the the pandemic changed the
election procedures and that made a
difference yes yes it made a difference
but he lost the Biden
I don't know how you get past that
right
how do you compare Trump to DeSantis in
a primary
they don't even compare do they
because you know you know Democrats are
going to be sort of or Republicans are
going to be sort of automatic for a
competent Republican all you need is
somebody who isn't going to embarrass
you and you get all the Republicans
and unfortunately Trump embarrasses some
Republicans
so you just can't get those
who who does DeSantis embarrass
nobody
there's there's no embarrassment to
factor so he just has to be solid and he
gets 100 of Republicans
but Trump can't do that
Trump can't just do a solid job and get
100 of Republicans because people are
kind of pissed
he'd lose to cheating again
I don't know I I'm optimistic that
um
that our elections are more watched than
they've ever been
uh and we don't have much of a complaint
this morning
except for the one one County that
everybody's watching carefully
so we'll see we we may be in good shape
we may be in good shape
Scott also believes the stripper loves
him very optimistic fellow
no I don't believe anybody loves me
so that's sort of my general uh my
Baseline I don't I don't mean you know
in the political in the public world
no I you know I know that uh many of you
have a positive feeling but I mean my
personal life
like in my personal life I just assume
nobody really loves me
I just
I'm not saying you should
I don't think he has to do with any of
my specific situations I just don't
assume it I I just assume it's all
transactional
I I saw some people on social media who
are saying that you know the way that
men love women and the way that women
love men is different
and I have to say it it matched my own
views I don't know if it's right
but the idea is that um women love what
men can provide it's a transactional
conditional relationship and that's all
it is
whereas men fall in love with
women
they're just the love of the woman
and so the woman can do
kind of anything good or bad
and it wasn't transactional in the first
place so the good or the bad won't
change your opinion about anything
you're still still want to stay married
whereas if the man doesn't provide the
things
then
you know could I uh inform some of you
 idiots about what incel means
can I can I show you in cell means
involuntary
involuntary
do any of you idiots think that
a rich healthy man in America can't get
laid
I'd like to see your opinion do you
believe that a rich
completely fit good BMI
ordinary person in America do you think
I can't get laid
in 2022
say so
all right so somebody says no
all right here's how this works
everybody who's healthy and has money
can get laid
if they're male I mean I don't I can't
speak for women maybe it's the same
right
um
but do you but do you buy that frame
that men have to provide by the way
Chris Rock was saying the same thing I
think Chris Rock said the only people
who are loved unconditionally
are women dogs and children
they're the only ones who get
unconditional love and but men you you
got to deliver so for men it's just what
you're providing
now when I said I don't assume that
anybody loves me in my personal life
that's what I meant
that's what I meant I meant the moment I
stopped providing the love would go away
of course
of course it would but I've never
assumed differently
have you
is there any man here who thinks that
they would still be loved if they
withdrew all of their benefit from the
person they think loves them
now maybe if you had like an accident
you know if if you had a tragic accident
you couldn't do what you wanted to do
then yes
you know you probably would still be
loved but she'd still have an affair
because she would love the other guy
better
if maybe he could provide more so yes
and and I find this really helpful
I find this helpful
uh I find it helpful to assume that men
aren't loved because then you don't get
disappointed
right so one of the things that I get a
lot of heat for is having two divorces
to to which I say
I wanted to get married
it was good for a number of years
and then when I didn't want to be
married I changed the situation and you
know so did the other person it's not
it's not all about one person
so
I don't I didn't get married because I
thought they would last forever
I never said that do you know why I
didn't think I would I would be married
forever
could be the reason why do you think I
didn't ever believe I would be married
forever
because
of the age difference
because what I could provide
was you know money and and comfort but
also you know a physical part you know
the physical intimacy as I aged it was a
hundred percent likely I could not
provide the physical intimacy
and that by the time that happened
whoever I was with would be rich by them
just by the relationship
so one so the the thing that I knew had
to happen
is that the things I was providing would
be taken for granted because they would
eventually be transferred in enough
quantity that they could divorce me and
be rich at the same time
so my benefit of keeping them you know
alive went to zero because they could do
it themselves and they were already rich
and any benefit I could bring from you
know my awesome physical intimacy would
eventually shrink to zero
am I right
what else am I providing
my great personality
there are plenty of guys with good
personalities
was that I'm so fun to be with that
somebody just has to be with me in the
room nope turns out there are plenty of
people who are fun to be with in a room
I didn't have anything
so I said to myself on day one I'm
bringing this amazing physical intimacy
that uh that I provide
a financial bubble that anybody would
want
a lifestyle of somebody who's a
celebrity
don't you think that some people sort of
you know would like a little bit that
their partner is a celebrity especially
if it's a male
yeah I mean they're all these little
benefits things I could provide that
other people couldn't provide
but it was a hundred percent guaranteed
from day one
that what I could provide would shrink
to zero
so therefore since I believe in a
transactional world at least we're
involves men and women I knew that
marriage was a rental and not a by Tone
now if you thought marriage was a buy to
own but you were in a similar situation
to me well you missed the signs you
missed the signals the signals were all
there you weren't going to get younger
but she was definitely going to get
richer right it was all there you should
have been able to predict it easily
all right
Judy says love is not transactional
well as soon as uh your guy stops giving
you stuff
check in with me see how that worked out
are you going to continue renting yeah I
think renting is all that makes sense in
from my age
I'm at the age where every woman wants
to marry me if she can stand me for five
minutes
do you know why
why does every woman want to marry me if
they can even stand me for five minutes
right because I'm near death and I'm
rich
I'm near death and I'm rich that's like
a really good deal
transactionally that's something that
most people would say you know this
might suck for 10 to 15 years
but if I could if I can if I could gut
it out for 10 to 15
. I'm rich
I'm rich
yeah so I'm very very popular so to the
whoever it is who who said I'm an incel
it's definitely not involuntary
uh I could get laid three times a day
it wouldn't take any effort whatsoever
none
all right
um
get another dog
uh why would you leave your to your
shitty new wife yeah who else is going
to get it
you might like your wife
um
someone as old as you yeah that's
possibility too
but two of those times will be with
David what
uh
did anyone in particular help you change
your mind to how you view women in
relationships
that's a good question uh now
I can't think uh I don't believe there's
any Guru or anything and by the way I
don't have this is nothing new
my my views on this are at least 25
years old but I definitely had different
views when I was young as I explained
early on early on I thought if I did
what women said they want wanted of men
that that would make them happy
have any any of you ever fell for that
if any of you men fell for that
the women will tell you exactly what
they want
and then you say ah I just have to give
them that and then they'll be happy you
fall in for that trick
yeah it took me decades to realize you
know like my pattern recognition wasn't
kicking in all the pattern was so so
clear it takes you a while to realize
that the operating system of women
is to be perpetually unhappy because men
think if I just solve this problem today
I'll be good tomorrow
they don't know they never catch on that
tomorrow is a new problem so the the
operating system then is to drain
resources operating system of women
is to drain resources for men by being
dissatisfied that's what works within a
relationship so dissatisfaction is a
requirement of the system it's not
today's problem that you're going to
solve
and once you realize that's unsolvable
you realize that women are essentially
toxic unless you have a combined
objective to have children
too strong the women are toxic to men
unless you have a shared mission
too strong
if you do have a shared Mission it could
work out great a shared Mission would be
um you want to have kids
you have the same lifestyle preferences
you like your friends you like doing the
same things lots of good reasons to be
married now anything I say bad about
relationships does not apply to all
people
I mean that's the thing we always get
wrong the problem with marriage is we
apply it which we think it applies to
all people at best it works for 20
percent
like really well it'll work you know
well enough for more than 20 but 20 are
killing it
and the rest kind of struggling or wish
they hadn't done it yeah
now women are toxic to men
unless they have a shared Mission and
then the man doesn't mind the resources
being deployed because that's where the
man wants them to be deployed
I I think I just red built the living
hell out of Erica the excellent
I'm just looking at your comments
all right uh that ladies and gentlemen
is all the red pilling and persuasion
you need for today go watch the rest of
the news and find out how much it sucks
compared to the awesomeness that was
this
and goodbye to YouTube talk to you
tomorrow
