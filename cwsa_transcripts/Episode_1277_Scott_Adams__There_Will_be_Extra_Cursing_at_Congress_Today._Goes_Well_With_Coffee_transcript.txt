a copper mugger glass attacker
challenger signed a canteen checkered
flashlight vessel of any kind

you'd better be ready go
yeah now if you enjoyed that live
you know what the feeling is don't you
yeah you do savor it savor it
okay now we can move on gotta stop and
smell the coffee
that's just good advice
well yesterday there was a big national
event something called a super bowl
have i ever told you before that one way
to predict the future
is that the best story almost always
wins
not every time but the best
story usually wins
who was the best story for the super
bowl
tom brady was the best story because he
left a dominating team
they decided that they didn't need him
anymore he was too old for them
and so they let him go what would you
want to do
if you had just been the greatest
quarterback
ever and you had just been let go from
your team
while being still a winning quarterback
because you were too old
what would you really really like to do
in that
situation well what you would like to do
is win another super bowl
with a different team because if you do
that
what does that tell your old coach
tells you it wasn't about him was it
what's it tell your old team
well it kind of says it wasn't about
them was it
maybe all those super bowls weren't
because you used to have a good coach
maybe the super bowls were because of
you
so i can't imagine anything that would
be more fun
than being tom brady this morning
can you i mean what would be more fun
than not only winning the super bowl yet
again
seventh seventh one i doubt anybody will
ever match that
and also rubbing it in the face of all
the people who said you were too old
guess i don't need that coach guess i
don't need that good team that was
behind me
now i'm not what you'd call a sports fan
i'll say some bad things about sports
later
but uh i had a little thing i was trying
to do
just sort of a mental experiment and it
went like this
i wanted to see if i could get all the
way through super bowl week
or the two weeks before super bowl and
all the way through the game
and all the way to today without once
knowing
the name of the quarterback who was
opposing
tom brady and i still don't know it
i actually don't know the name of the
other quarterback
for the kansas city chiefs
uh can anybody tell me the name of the
quarterback who is the other guy
don't even know his name
patrick mahomes somebody say don't know
okay i guess that's the name of an
athlete patrick
mahomes well patrick mahomes did not get
a lot of attention
relative to tom brady yesterday how
would you like to play in the super bowl
and people don't even know your name
[Laughter]
i i guess a lot of people didn't know
his name the ones who actually watched
the super bowl
there were a lot of jokes that came
after the super bowl
including uh brett wine weinstein
who said uh in a tweet how long before
the court's rule on who actually won the
super bowl
now that was a good tweet and a good
joke
but not as good as all the comments
on this tweet so go look for that in
either
brett weinstein weinstein's
feed or in mine i retweeted him
yesterday
or today and you should see all the
other funny comments
it turns out this this was a really good
straight line
or at least the situation was a good
straight line for lots of good jokes
all right now do you believe my theory
about the best story usually wins
and tom brady was the best story so even
though he was not favored
in terms of you know the specifics of
the betting odds
of these games he had the best story
so now uh remember i first used this
theory when president trump ran for
office in 2016
he was the best story by far him winning
was the best story
but when he ran for re-election
what was the best story it really wasn't
trump wins another election because that
would have been
sort of expected so that's not the best
story
you you expect incumbents to win
the best story would be running somebody
who's clearly mentally defective
while you're really trying to put in
office the vice president
who's too progressive according to a lot
of people
that's a good story right if you compare
those two stories of
trump just wins again and you get more
of the same
or the brain dead dementia guy who's
being really backed by the real
president i mean it's not even close one
of them is the good story
so watch how often that predicts it's
there's no reason for that by the way at
least that i can think of now the best
reason might be that
because our minds are so tuned to
stories from movies and books and all
the all the fiction that we consume
that we that we we kind of guide
ourselves subconsciously toward the best
story
so maybe even the players on the field
with tom brady
even the other team knew that the best
story was them losing
right so it could be that we're just too
biased toward the best story
that we make it happen without even
knowing that we're consciously making
any choices
maybe or it's just a it's just a
coincidental thing that
i think i'm noticing but i'm not that's
possible
here's a a little uh
mental exercise for you and this is a
good mental exercise for
every situation i'll give you a specific
one here
but in general it's good to do this and
i talk about this and lose or think a
little bit in my book
sometimes take a situation that you're
very familiar with and you have an
opinion on
and just say to yourself what if i'm
totally wrong
what if i've got the wrong filter on
this what if i'm just looking at it
upside down
what if i've got cause and effect
backwards
and that doesn't mean that you're wrong
it just means that it's a good exercise
to every now and then then say what if
everything is just
exactly backwards of the way i think it
is
i do that all the time i take anything
that i'm sure is true
and i just say but what if it's
backwards
would would it still work like would all
the with all the evidence that i'm
looking at
still apply and still be perfectly
compatible
if you took what you thought to be true
and literally reversed it
and sometimes you surprise yourself you
say uh
uh-oh i just found out that all the
facts i'm looking at
work both ways it's scary when it
happens and you realize how
how fragile your mental process is i'm
going to do that for you right now
i'm not going to try to change your mind
okay
i don't want you to change your mind on
the topic that i'm going to bring up
i'm only going to show you an exercise
where you can reverse
the truth and it won't be crazy
that's all i'm going for okay just the
process
don't change your mind on anything
when we look at the issue of don't don't
sign off yet
i know you're going to turn off this
live stream as soon as you hear this
topic because everybody always does
transgenders in sports stay with me stay
with me
just for a little while you'll it's
worth it
just stay stay okay
you know that i am one of the leading
voices
at least in terms of being vocal in
public about it uh
for saying that transgender should have
every right to play sports
etc but what do what is the common way
to look at this the common way that
conservatives look at it is this this is
not my opinion
i'm describing other people's opinion
the sports is good
and there's something wrong with the
transgender athlete
that they're they're broken in some way
or they're
morally or ethically deficient because
they would want to play on a
on a team in which they would dominate
because they were born with some
biological male qualities
that they've been transferring out of
that's what you think right wouldn't you
say that the most common opinion from
the conservative side of the world again
not my opinion
but a common one is that sports are good
just the way they are
and it's there's something wrong with
the athlete in this case
now i'm just going to ask you this
question
what happens if you reverse it and you
say that sports
are broken but all the athletes are fine
what if you just say how about the world
is full of all kinds of different people
there are short people
tall people people who have skills
people are strong people are weak
people have different gender sex traits
infinite different people can can people
really be broken
is it really the people who are
defective here because people come in
all kinds
it's hard to say that any one of them is
wrong when it's an
infinite variety and none of them are
exactly the same
why don't we say the sports are broken
and here's specifically what i mean
the best kind of sports would be where
you're playing with somebody who is
roughly equal in ability isn't that the
whole problem with having a transgender
athlete
playing on a women's traditional team
the whole problem
is that you have a mismatch of talent
and even physicality right
so the problem is not that the athlete
is broken
there's nothing wrong with the athlete
who wants to just play some sports
what's wrong is that the sport doesn't
allow people
of equal ability to play against each
other you want another example
i'm male so according to the rules of
sports
the way they exist i could play on a
men's
basketball team if i were let's say in
college or high school
but could i could i play on a men's
basketball team
i'm five foot eight no
no i can't there should be a sport for
me
in which i can play basketball against
people who are roughly the same height
that would be a good sport what is the
point of putting me
in a game in which i'm playing with
people who are seven feet tall
there's no point in that the sport is
broken
it's not me i'm not defective because
i'm five foot eight
i'm kind of in the normal range of human
beings there are people smaller than me
people bigger than me it's completely
normal
to not be normal right we're all not
normal in some way
fix the sport why in the world
do you ever put people of wildly
different abilities on the same team
does it matter what the gender is
you shouldn't if i've told this story
before i played co-ed soccer years ago
and one of the women who played co-ed
soccer on our team
was really good so as a female player
she was
extra good at soccer which made her
better at soccer than
maybe a quarter of the men that were on
the field
now the other men were also good at
soccer and they're
physically stronger so they had some
advantages but she was probably better
than a good
25 of the men who were playing should
she
have to play with only female athletes
if she would prefer to play with
stronger players and the answer is no
she was perfectly happy playing co-ed
soccer with people who were physically
bigger than her
now it didn't work out well for her
uh it turns out i i broke her nose but
if she had not been on a team with
larger men maybe
her nose would not have been broken i
didn't do it
intentionally by the way i just cleared
a ball
fairly aggressively her face was in the
way a lot of blood happened
but did she quit playing soccer she did
of course because her face was broken
but she had the right to play and she
was with people of equal talent and it's
where she wanted to be
the sports were broken not her and not
me
so that is my point sports are broken
why do you have men's teams and women's
teams instead of just
teams why can't people just play on the
on the team that's the right
that's matched to their ability why do
why do sports have to be part of
high school and college it's ridiculous
the way high school sports are designed
is to make stars out of a few people
and to make everybody else feel like a
loser sorry
that's the way they're designed sports
make most
people losers and they make stars and of
a few people who were born with some
lucky combination of things that made
them athletically gifted
and why do we praise people who were
born athletically gifted
i don't know i don't see a good reason
i'd rather see somebody who wasn't born
athletically gifted do a good
you know try hard and do good work for
what they've got
all right so fix sports so that
everybody can play
in the team that is roughly their
ability and while you're at it why don't
you fix the rest of sports which are
broken
i'll give you some more examples golf
is mostly about looking for your ball
that's a stupid sport golf should make
all of the
clubs the same length number one
having having clubs of different lengths
is just stupid
i mean it's just making it extra hard
for no reason
make the balls easier to find or allow
you to just put your ball down wherever
is the last place you saw it it'd be
better
how about uh how about tennis tennis
used to be fun
it used to be my favorite sport and i
would play with people roughly my
ability and so it was a lot of fun
but then the the equipment got so good
the actual tennis racquet that even a
average player can hit a serve so hard
that a good player can't return it so
tennis is a completely ruined sport
because the equipment got so good
that the whole serving part of it which
is so so big a part of the sport
is not fun it's not even close to fun it
just the ball goes past you
or maybe you hit it but it's just luck
so
tennis is a completely ruined sport
because when the equipment got good it
just became
not fun to play anymore that's why i
don't play anymore
so all of sports are broken stop
thinking that the athletes are broken
there's nothing wrong with transgender
athletes there's nothing wrong with
any athletes people are just different
give everybody a way to play sports
and the whole idea that women need to
have trophies
aren't we over that i don't know why
anybody needs a sports trophy unless
they're a professional
if you're a professional then yeah i can
see you know
having things arranged differently
because it's foreign it's for spectating
but for for school sports uh
get rid of sports in schools now those
of you who are
resisting it's because your kids do well
in sports
if if i had kids who did really well in
sports
i would want i would definitely want
sports in schools
but most kids are not good in sports
so what's good for your kids might not
be good for other people all right
apparently two-thirds of voters or
citizens i don't know maybe it's voters
like biden's coveted plans so that
includes a third of republicans
say he's doing okay in covet i'll give
you my opinion
he's doing okay i think he's doing okay
if i had to grade biden for covert
response
pretty good now there's still things
that
uh he needs to do better but
uh here's something he did really well
now i know some of you aren't gonna like
this because i know the nature of my
audience
but you i need you to get used to this
so it doesn't bother you in the future
when biden does something right i'm
going to call it out
all right i'm not about just criticizing
him for things i don't like
so i'm going to do the same treatment
that i gave trump
but i'll do it for biden and he's about
to do something that's
really really smart if he pulls it off
and that is this as you know teachers
unions are the biggest threat to this
country
um but the federal government doesn't
want to exert
you know direct control over unions
because that's
politically bad as well as uh you know
the country isn't ready for that
you don't want your federal government
to put a boot on a union
it's just not a good look but
the school unions are the biggest
problem in the country because they're
keeping the
teachers and schools which keeps the
schools
closed so biden is in favor of opening
reopening the schools as soon as you can
do that safely
i think that's exactly what president
trump's opinion was
probably exactly what most of your
opinions are so we
we can say okay good so far the biden is
pro
opening schools soon and safely
but he can't get it done so what do you
do
well what biden is doing is he said at
least in his interview on cbs he said
that
by wednesday-ish the cdc will have a
here's the fun part science-based
recommendations
about how to open schools so though
presumably it will say if you take the
following precautions
science says it's safe enough to open up
schools
so what happens when science
which democrats love i hear they love
their science
everybody loves science so it's dumb to
imagine there's somebody who is
anti-science but that's what they say
about
that's what they say about uh
republicans so biden is setting up a
situation in which his cdc
will say scientifically it's okay to
open up schools
under these conditions which most could
meet
what happens then when the teachers
unions say no
well that will put the teachers unions
in a public
disagreement with wait for it
science that's pretty good
that's pretty good because biden is a
little bit handcuffed his own party is
so close to the unions
he can't stomp on a union but he needs
to
if you ask biden privately would you
like to stomp on these unions
and make them just agree to open up the
schools with you
safely i'm pretty sure he'd say yes
if i could if i had a way to stomp on
them i would
because it needs to be done i believe he
would agree with that statement he would
agree with
most republicans on that and most people
most parents for
sure but he may have found a workaround
he may have found a workaround we don't
know yet
but setting up this public battle
between
science as it will be presented by the
cdc
and the schools that are supposed to
teach
science as represented by the the
teachers unions right
isn't that interesting that is really
really good
if he if he does this right and then and
so far he's setting it up just right
that the news that's friendly to biden
the news that propagandizes and and
and brainwashes the public what is the
news going to do
when biden sets up teaches unions are
anti-science
what's the news going to do
it's pretty good i think the news is
going to have to back science
aren't they how does cnn go against
science when it's biden science they
can't
i think he's created a situation in
which he can use the public
as a hammer and also use the news
networks as a hammer against the
teachers unions
and i don't know that there was a better
play than that
it's actually really good so if i'm
going to be honest
and we're dealing with technique and
persuasion not politics per se
just technique and persuasion this is
pretty good
now we got to see if he can take it home
right it's not good enough that he just
puts it out there and then nothing
happens
he's going to have to sit on this
scientific recommendation
and he's going to have to pound it but
he could
he could do that all right i'm not going
to rule him out i'm not going to say he
can't i'm not going to say he won't
until he tries but if he lets this go
and the teacher unions just prevail
after he set it up the science
says this and they say that well that
would be a pretty big failure i think
i think once he's set it up that science
is on the opposite side from the
teachers unions
he has to finish them right
he can't wound the teachers unions
he has to finish them off at least on
this topic not
not completely so we'll see if he's got
the uh
he's got the guts to do that he might
we'll see and if he does i will praise
him for it
um so the news is saying this is also
something cbs said
nora o'donnell said that at the current
rate of
vaccinations it would take uh like a
year to get 75 percent of people
vaccinated which
might be what you need to stop the virus
do you think that that tells you
something what what do you what
should you think when somebody says at
the current rate
it will take a year how should you
translate that in your mind
should you translate it into your mind
as it's going to take a year
you shouldn't because what you should
translate in your mind
is that there's a learning curve here
and it's a pretty big one
meaning that on day one you expect
everything to go poorly because they've
never done this before
on day two they're fixing the problems
they saw on day one
on day three they're fixing the problems
they saw on day two
so by the time you get let's say six
months into this
your learning curve should have gone
through the roof
and you we're seeing now that biden has
been offered by i guess the nfl offered
all of their stadiums every every
football stadium has been
offered as a mass vaccination place
right where'd that come from and that
just came out of nowhere right and it's
because we needed it
so this is similar to the um the year
2000 bug
when all the experts were saying at our
current rate
there's no way we'll be able to
reprogram the computers they'll crash
and society will be
damaged by a lack of computing for a
while
but i said no you got it all wrong the
learning curve
suggests that the last few months before
the actual
year 2000 our ability to reprogram
things will be way better
than you could even imagine back even
just a few months ago
and what happened exactly that happened
a few months before the year 2000 bug
would have been a giant problem
private industry figured out how to
rapidly re-program it
so they learned to do something quickly
toward the end which is the way you
would normally expect these things to go
so here's my prediction if they say that
it would take a year
at current rates you could probably cut
that in half
you could probably cut it in half
because we're probably a month away
from really really knowing what we're
doing wrong and fixing it
and then the rate of vaccination should
just start
going straight up that would be the
normal thing to expect in a normal
process of this type where everyone
wants the outcome
and we're all working toward it we just
have to
get rid of the wrinkles and it looks
like that's happening
all right um do you own bitcoin
how many of you own bitcoin
because there's some news about bitcoin
uh
elon musk who continues to be the most
interesting person on the planet
this uh has said that tesla will start
accepting bitcoin
as payment for tesla products
now how important is that
it's really important because uh
elon musk is a big enough player
that he can make the currency have a
value that it didn't have before
he just he just basically he just made
it a legitimate currency
he has the power of a government
because it's a government that makes a
currency a currency
the government says you can always pay
us in dollars
for your taxes so as long as the
government will always take your dollars
your dollar always has a value because
you always have to pay your taxes
they'll take your dollar that dollar
will always have a value
but bitcoin was not something that
anybody had to take
the government didn't take it in terms
of taxes
and there weren't any big companies the
big companies that would say
we'll only take bitcoin and there
still are not as far as i know but when
somebody as big as musk
and a company as big as tesla says we
will take it for our cars
a big ticket item elon musk
just made bitcoin a currency like a real
currency
he just did that with a freaking tweet
the most uh the richest or second
richest he'll be richest at some point
probably
uh yeah he'll be richest when he owns
space then he
he's on his way to be the richest for
sure
unless amazon gets there first or bezos
gets there first
so that's a big deal i don't own any
bitcoin
at the moment and i don't make a
financial
recommendations but i'm definitely gonna
be uh
looking at bitcoin a little harder now i
used to own bitcoin i sold it when i was
up at one point
uh so it's not like i haven't made money
in bitcoin i just don't have any at the
moment
but i might change that we'll see uh
meanwhile
jake tapper did a uh
did a what would you call a monologue or
something about
how there's been no real accountability
for several prominent gop
leaders after the capital riot now
i don't know what has happened to jake
tapper but
uh i just don't know what's happened to
him
he looks like something's happened in
his personal life or something because
his his demeanor on camera when he's
talking about the republicans and
the need for accountability it just
feels
demented and revengey and
and broken in some way he doesn't look
like he's calling for justice he looks
like he has a personal mental problem of
some sort
now i'm not saying he has a mental
problem because how would i know what
any what's happening in anybody's head
i'm telling you the way it comes across
is not like opinion
it comes across as a mental problem
that that's how i read it now again i'm
not saying
he has a mental problem i'm saying that
i i
perceive it that way that's just the way
it looks
it looks like he has some kind of a
mental issue or emotional problem
um but when he talks about the no real
accountability
for several prominent leaders here's
what i hear i hear him
looking to punish anybody who had a
different opinion on this
and extend that by extension
he didn't say this directly but by
extension you would think that he would
apply this to
trump supporters including people like
me
now he didn't say that so that's not
something
jake tapper says directly but that's the
message i hear
that's what i hear when he talks about
it
but here's the interesting part in order
for jake tapper to maintain his
righteous indignation he has to assume
that this election was fair and free
and that's making you think past the
sale because the best of my knowledge
nobody could determine uh given the
lack of transparency of this election
and
probably all of our elections there is
no way to know
that it was fair and free there is only
a way to know
that it has not been proven in any court
that there was widespread fraud
so those things can both be true at the
same time we don't know if it was fair
and free
but we do know for sure it hasn't been
proven that it was fraudulent in any
widespread way
in the court now we also know that
courts are the wrong
tool for for doing that because they
reject the cases on different
grounds than the fraud
so that's our situation but for people
like jake tapper to
illegitimately claim that it would be or
at least
the implication of making you think past
the sale
is that we know for sure that the
election was perfectly
perfectly good and we don't know that
we only know that there's no proof it
was bad
which is quite different and
when i see him you know gaslighting the
public like this
and calling for essentially revenge
against a class of citizens this is the
worst thing i've ever seen
did i did i warn you that there would be
a little extra cursing today
we're getting to the extra cursing
portion of the program
so this would be the part where you
maybe want to take the kids away
jake tapper has turned into a horrible
horrible person
and the way i read this is an attack on
part of the public
the viewing public now i am perfectly
okay
with democrats mocking trump supporters
for you know being on the losing side of
the election
i mean the trump supporters did the same
to hillary's supporters
that's just all part of the process but
jake tapper
with all seriousness talking about the
real accountability
of prominent gop leaders accountability
for
what exactly because he's calling this
this uh takeover of a viking
horn guy
with some and another guy with some
twist eyes occupying some empty rooms
in the capitol building uh he's calling
that
a insurrection or a coup what do you
think the people who did that
want it jake tapper and cnn
what do you think they were asking for
were any of them asking for
an illegitimate government to be
installed
no every one of those people
wanted the constitution to be
followed and the election to be fair
did any of them say we would like
the a different president even though
the election we believe
was fair no what were they asking for
a change in who was the president based
on
uh non-constitutional methods
no they were asking for constitutional
processes
they were protesting too aggressively
they need to
pay for any any too aggressive actions
the legal system still has to do what it
does
but for people like jake tapper to sell
this
 thing as a coup when it wasn't
it was an attempt to make sure a coup
had not happened
in this country and people like jake
tapper are selling the coup
meaning you know at least the allegation
that the election was uh
was not appropriate so branding these
these democrats i'm sorry branding the
gop leaders
who were uh asking for
a little extra time for a audit
and by the way they didn't ask for
anything to be delayed
ted cruz was simply asking to use the
time we have to do a little auditing
that's it
that simple request fair and reasonable
has been turned into there are a bunch
of insurrectionist
treasonous people who need to be
punished forever and so do you
if you support them you piece of
jake tapper you piece of
 i hope you see this i'm sure
somebody will send it to you
jake i used to like you but you've
turned into a very bad person
as a human being you should have some
something to
to think about you've gone way beyond
telling the news
and you've gone way beyond having an
opinion on the news that i don't agree
with
you've gone into evil you are
painting your fellow citizens
with lies and fake news from the
find people hoax to the drinking bleach
 hoax in your whole
 illegitimate fake news
organization
and now you've made it personal
it's personal now jake tapper
this is personal you
you've made it personal
because i'll tell you the way the way
people listening to you are going to
take it
is not i don't know what way you mean it
but if you're talking about in uh
generating
uh violence in this country by your
speech you're doing it now
 jake tapper you are causing some
real
 problems all right these are
real problems
you're causing them with your way of
talking
what you could have done to help the
country heal would be something along
the lines of hey
i know a lot of people had questions
with the election but it'd be better if
we moved on now
try to fix them next time maybe jake
tapper you could be talking about
what the country is doing to fix the
election for the next time
jake tapper do you have anything to say
about that do you have anything to say
about the fact
that you're not reporting on anything
being done to
fix the election for next time
how about that being the most important
thing in the country and you don't even
 mention it
because you're still on revenge you're
still on
getting back at these
republicans
you small piece of
do something good for the country do
something good for the country
speaking of pieces of
congress the democrats
seem unable to read the room
because here's my feeling
was it appropriate for democrats to
criticize republicans and
protesters sure criticism is always
appropriate
always we like a good free speech
and give and take so no problem with
anybody's you know opinions
and i don't have any problem with
anybody who broke any laws being
punished to the full extent of the law
although there is a real question about
free will here
and brainwashing et cetera so i wouldn't
give them
anything like bad uh
sentences i mean i i would do suspended
sentences
if i were in charge of that but
something you know
there has to be some response from the
legal system for sure
but here's the problem
there's a limit to how far
normal people are willing to be pushed
and i think i just reached my limit
so it's one thing to say you know you're
a bad person because you were associated
with trump or whatever
they go okay that's just free speech
it's just opinion
but when you start making it like it's
some kind of national priority to
punish people who had a different
political opinion
and punish people who don't think that
our election system
was transparent you've gone too far
and when you take president trump who is
out of office and is no risk to anybody
and there's no chance he's going to run
and win an election
there's no chance and you're just making
this a complete waste of time
and you've decided that you can't do
your regular work which is essential
essential the normal work of getting out
the you know the
stimulus stuff getting people nominated
so they can do the work of the
government
somehow without all these nominations
there's no chaos in the biden
administration
it's amazing it's amazing or it could be
that there's just bad reporting we don't
know
but here's my bottom line on this
going hard at trump when he's in office
perfectly acceptable
going hard at him as hard as you want to
go
while he's in office makes sense
we have that system i wouldn't object to
it
but going hard at him after he's out of
office
is really going after me
and many of you because this isn't about
trump anymore is it
it really isn't this is about the people
who supported him
this is about the public this is
personal
criticizing politics well that's just
politics
this part of the the trump saga
the part where they're going to take two
weeks and the public's time
for congress and they're going to grind
on
on him just to grind on you
this is personal this has nothing to do
with politics it's personal
and i take it personally so to the
democrats who are
pushing this completely
useless waste of time
i take it personally and
every one of you
who wants to make this personal vendetta
this revenge-filled
if you want to waste my time
doing this punishing me
go ahead but read the room
because this isn't going to be free if
you think you have a free punch
you're wrong because
i don't get mad that easily
but i'm there if you can't make this
this impeachment thing trial go away
you're pieces of
you don't care about the country you
don't care about a thing except
revenge
and you suck and
there should be some way to to
make a penalty for this um
a editor for the daily beast or
uh wrote at me and when i said you the
democrats should read the room
and he tweeted back a picture of uh one
of the
uh protesters with a
confederate flag standing in the capitol
building
and he said this room
to which i say you daily beast
 you i didn't that wasn't me in
there with the flag
it's not clever we know there were
people in a room
you know that's not the point
just you just every one of you
who thinks that punishing these people
to punish the rest of us
is a good idea it's not a good idea
it's a really bad idea
 i'm gonna have to run for president
[Applause]
all right that is my angry screen for
the day
um can you reflect on the immediate
60-day stand down i don't know what that
is
there's a 60 day stand down of what
somebody says the person was with the
flag was antifa
well i doubt it but there could be some
uh
there could be some some antifa uh
element there but i don't think that's
the whole story
um
gonna get you somebody says
you and candace
uh all right i'm just looking at your
comments i have your vote
you know the thing is that if anybody
who looked at me
on paper would say to themselves
well there's no way he could get elected
but you have no idea what my
capabilities are
you have no idea one of the weird things
about
having my weird skill set for
persuasion and once you once you become
a hypnotist
one of the things that occurs to you is
that you can't
use your full power now if there's
anybody out here
who has studied hypnosis and you've
actually become a hypnotist
i'll bet you've had the same thought
haven't you
which is it's a little bit too much
power for a person
and you have to make this decision about
how much to use
your persuasive ability because if you
use it too much you're just eliminating
people's
free will basically you know if you took
it to the max
and i would not find that ethical or
moral
so in my case i make a uh a
conscious effort to not be as persuasive
as i could be
depending on the topic right
and i do that because i'm aware of it's
like being a prize fighter you know you
can't get in a street fight
if you're a prize fighter where's that
old-time term come from
if you're a professional boxer you can't
get in a street fight
because if you kill the guy you had a
deadly weapon because you're a
professional boxer
blah blah so hypnotists have a similar
thing
which is you have to make this decision
about whether to
change people's minds and whether you
have the right to do that
you know do you have a right to change
somebody's mind
it's a it's an interesting question
isn't it i mean we do
i mean legally we have the right but is
it morally and ethically right
to change somebody's mind about
something
within reason it is but but there's a
point beyond which it is no longer
reasonable all right um
i can't wait to see your campaign ads i
don't know if i would campaign
if i ran for president i don't think i
would even leave the house
because why should i what is it or that
i could do in person that i couldn't do
on video nothing i could run the entire
campaign without leaving the house
how would you debate trump i wouldn't
if trump were in the election i wouldn't
run
go after china yeah well
china would have to china would have to
kill me
if i if it looked like i were going to
become president
china would probably have to have me
taken out somehow
because china would not be in for a good
run if i were president
um what does the republican where does
the republican party go from here
well the republican party has a real
problem that they don't have a leader
now on paper trump is sort of a leader
but he's
missing an action who who exactly is the
leader of the republican party
because if you don't have a leader it
doesn't really have a
a brand per se and nobody has emerged
it's a little too early
you know there's too much trump hanging
over everything
so it's a little too early for anybody
to emerge you're seeing uh tom cotton
tom cotton is clearly trying to make
some space for himself
matt gates you see
uh rand paul so those are the ones who
are
sort of floating up in in prominence but
we'll see
um would you admit the president
can't control co2
well why would i admit that because the
president
can control co2 a little bit
the president can't control most of it
but they can control a little bit
um biden didn't even campaign yeah you
know
if you look at the biden example um
campaigning didn't seem that important
it didn't seem that important
you know if i ran for president all they
would talk about is that i'm a hypnotist
it would just make everybody crazy
because they wouldn't know
you know the stories would be we can't
tell is he hypnotizing us
is this hypnosis wait a minute does he
believe this or is he just saying this
it would make the the news business
would be crazy
let me tell you uh since uh
i i the only the only way i'd run for
president is if i were so mad
that i didn't care what happened to
myself like if i lost all
fear of personal harm and
that happens to me if i get mad enough
i'm not there yet
but i'm getting close
but you would have to know that you
would be destroying your own life to run
for president i think that's
that's kind of built into the process
now unfortunately
so being president of this country is
sort of a kamikaze
pilot run you don't come back
it's sort of a one-way trip so maybe
it's better if you're a certain age
because your life is over when you're
done
in in the current system
uh you would not win
trust me i would
all right if you were that good the
media would never criticize you
no the media criticizes that's what they
do it doesn't matter what you do
if you think that criticism follows
actions you haven't been paying
attention criticism follows
team the team criticizes the other team
that's just
how the game is played it has nothing to
do with what the other team is actually
doing
so let me make you this promise
if i ran for president or somebody
decided to take me out
there would be immediately be a number
of stories about my personal life
that you would hear that would be very
interesting
meaning that it would be things that
would be designed to make you say
he did that in his personal life well i
can't vote for that
um but here's the rule you should take
you've heard the uh
um what you call it the uh the gel man
amnesia theory that if you happen to be
famous and you see stories about
yourself in the news
you know those stories are false in fact
i was just
i just googled something yesterday and
it brought up some stories that included
me
and i'm reading the stories and every
bit of it is just wrong
like i know it because the story is
about me
but i mean just basic biographical
you know what year things happened or
why something happened
just completely made up crap and i know
that the stories about me are just made
up
but you don't you think stories about
famous people are
probably usually mostly true right
not even close stories about famous
people are
usually false usually because at least
there's context left out
and the stories about me are usually
false and have been for
30 years that i've been tracking it
usually very misleading usually
not not sometimes usually
if you don't understand the usually part
you don't understand
anything about the news so
if i ran for president you would see a
bunch of stories about me
how would you know if they were true
because you would hear stuff
that would be just like shocking i don't
even know what it would be
because most of it wouldn't be true or
it would be stuff that's true
but it's out of context so it looks bad
when it really wasn't right
so what what percentage of those would
you guess are true
probably not many if any so here is the
advice i would give you if i run for
president
someday you should assume that all of
the stories about my personal life
are true all of them just assume they're
all true
except anything that alleges i broke a
law
because that's probably not true but
anything that
looked like it wasn't breaking a law but
it was just really bad behavior
just like really bad behavior assume
it's true
because if i couldn't win the presidency
anyway
i'd be surprised you you could assume
every bad thing about me that isn't
against the law
is completely true it won't be of course
it's not going to be true
it's going to be 75 false at least
if not hundred but i wouldn't even talk
you out of it if somebody said oh
scott you did x or y and it was just
like the worst sounding thing you'd ever
heard in your life
but it wasn't illegal do you know what
i'd say i prefer you believe that
i'm not going to talk you out of
anything interesting if you think i did
something with a gerbil
that didn't hurt the gerbil
okay fine with me
go ahead and believe it in fact if it
makes me more interesting
a plus so yeah just make up any story
you want
the thing that makes me dangerous is
that i'm not beholden to anybody
i'm just not uh so i don't know how
how often you can get a president who is
not beholden to anybody
but uh i would be one
um taking people out of it is the whole
point of a smear story yeah
christina would be an elegant first lady
she'd be terrific
she'd hate it i don't think she would
like the uh
the job so i'd really have to be angry
to run for president because it would be
bad for the bad for the marriage
all right uh that's all for now and i
will talk to you
later remember that periscope will go
away in
the i think in march uh and so you'll
always find me live
on livestream on youtube which i run
simultaneously
and so when periscope is gone just look
for me on youtube
just google real coffee with scott adams
or look in my twitter feed it'll always
be there near the top
and that is all and i will talk to you
tomorrow
all right youtubers i've got another
minute with you
um hey aloha
how's hawaii
they'd say i left my ex-wife for a
younger woman
yeah they would say all of that stuff
how do they
all right just looking at your comments
all right uh thanks for all your
comments i'm not ready
to run for president yet but uh
uh that would be fun you know if i
picked a vice president
i would have to do what trump did so
trump
picked pence so that there was one
person who knew how government worked
in the team and i would do the same
thing if i if i ran for president i
would pick as a running mate
a traditional um probably a congress
person or a governor or something like
that
but i can't imagine any i can't imagine
any real politician who would want to be
my running mate
all right that's it for now i'll talk to
you tomorrow
