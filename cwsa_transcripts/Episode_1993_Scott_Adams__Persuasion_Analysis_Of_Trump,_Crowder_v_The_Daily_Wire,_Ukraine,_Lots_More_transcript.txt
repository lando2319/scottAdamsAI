good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization Today's
show will be really some that well I
feel sorry for the people who aren't
here honestly I do you're going to be so
much smarter when you're done
and if you'd like to prepare yourself
for the incoming amazingness
well all you need for that is a copper
mug or a glass of can tanker Chelsea
style and a canteen jogger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine to the Daily thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip of the habits now go
foreign
yeah you weren't ready were you gotcha
see sometimes you got to be ready to
leap at it
all right today's presentation is going
to be primarily
about persuasion
it's the one time you don't all hate me
I I don't think I'm going to say
anything today that will offend any of
you in fact you'll probably like the
whole thing I don't know but we'll find
out
but I want to show you something to
start off with the
sweetest thing I've ever seen now I hate
to be a big old softy
but I just have to give a shout out to
this
uh most of you know conservative Matt
Walsh
right Matt Walsh and you may know that
if you follow his Twitter account he had
some twins recently so congratulations
on that and he reports that wife and
babies were finally discharged from the
hospital this gets better by the way
this gets this gets to something you're
gonna like hold on
so other it just sounds like somebody's
baby but
um so he gets these twins
and what I learned from his tweet today
is he already had twins
says two sets of twins
but
here's what he tweets wife and babies
were finally discharged from the
hospital today I assumed there was some
you know concern that they stayed a
little extra
um and he says the older twins haven't
left their brother's side since they
came home
my daughter ex my daughter explained
that someone needs to be sitting and
watching over them even while they nap
and here's a picture
of his older Twins were not that older I
can't tell what maybe 10.
10 years old or something and they
decided on their own that these that
their siblings could not be alone
so they're sitting there reading it
looks like
and making sure that the babies are
never alone even when they're sleeping
now
here's the thing
I I've had this discussion before
in which so let's say Matt Walsh is the
you know the uh
the poster child for traditional
marriage wouldn't you say
if there's anybody who's like the person
you think of when he talks about
traditional marriage I think of him
and I always say judicial marriage is
absolutely the best way to go
for about 25 percent of people
the trouble is you know if one of you is
a addict or crazy or something you know
nothing works but for about 25 and I
know you would argue oh it's higher it's
maybe 75 percent but today I'm not going
to have that argument I think it's 25
you think it's 75 but you know it's not
100 and it's not zero
but
talk about winning oh my God
how many of you
like heard this story and just said uh
if I could if I could have that life
that looks pretty good doesn't it like
you could already you can already like
Fast Forward yourself into the future
where they're having you know big family
events and all the twins are there and
stuff that sounds like so much fun
I I'm just going to call it out
because it's the best it's just the best
little anecdote
of why people like traditional families
it looks pretty strong
so congratulations Matt Walsh I'll just
add this one thing that no matter how
winning other people seem to be
remember do you remember the basket case
Theory
Basket Case Theory I've told you this
before
that what you know about other people is
a very small amount of who they are
right so if you imagine that the Walsh
family has solved all of their problems
I'm sure that's wrong I I I'm sure they
have some challenges like everyone but
on the surface this is pretty amazing
story and I just like it Elizabeth
Warren tweets apparently a bunch of
people are worried that Zell the digital
payment service that is owned by some of
the big Banks including Bank of America
is stealing their money
what
I don't even know what to say about this
apparently there are a whole lot of
people and I don't know what percentage
and I don't know how true it is
but a whole bunch of people
um
I think Laura Loomer was one of them I
saw a tweet from her who say that their
payments payments are being sent and
then they don't re they're not received
on the other end it looks like Bank of
America is keeping it or somebody's
keeping it or it's disappearing so it's
a little bit of fog of War right now
so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna claim
that I know what's happening in this
story because I don't think anybody does
in fact Elizabeth Warren's you know puts
it as sort of a question she's
she's uh she says I've called out
serious fraud issues on Zell and this is
their latest failure
so I don't know what the other fraud
issues are on cell
is there some reason to is Laura Luber
credible well on there she is sure do
you think Laura Loomer would tweet that
she was having problems with Zell if she
just made it up
now I'm not saying it's true because she
said it
but really
you think somebody would just make that
up
there's nothing in her history that
would suggest you to do that
is there like you could like you know
like or dislike other things you said
but I don't think that doesn't sound
like a lie
could be anything's possible but it
doesn't sound like a lie to me
anyway we'll keep an eye on that uh New
Zealand New Zealand's prime minister
resigned
uh yes and uh what's her name uh ardern
now she was famous for being a
progressive and doing things a little
differently she was also famous for
having a baby while prime minister
because she was one of the youngest
leaders we've ever had she had a baby
and she managed to do her job while
being a mom as well being a young mom
but she's decided that it's a little too
much and she's decided she's I'll use my
own words burned out
and then she doesn't have the
the drive or energy to run New Zealand
and run her family I guess
so
here's how CNN
described it and this is in a in the
CNN's website
um it started off by saying burnout is
real and it's nothing to be ashamed of
that's the conclusion trailblazing New
Zealand uh leader yasinda Arden ardern
seems to have reached after almost six
brutal years in office
so CNN is first saying you know burnout
must be recognized as a a genuine
phenomenon and we should not ignore it
okay I'm all with you on that
later on in the story they say during
her time in power ardern showed that it
was possible to juggle a young family
and a demanding role
good for her
look at that she managed to run a
country and you know juggle her home
demands as well very good
and now she's leading by example to show
that when a tank is empty and there's no
more to give it's also okay to opt out
now this is pretty good
this is pretty good on her part not only
is she proving that you can you can run
a country and have a family but she's
also proving at the same time that you
can't run a country and have a family
so a lot of people would just try to
demonstrate one thing at a time
she's doing two
this is quite impressive and CNN I
credit them for calling this out that
she's not only proving that you can do
everything have a family and have a
demanding job but also that you can't
so
what
I'm going to read a comment
from Erica and she says so this is not
me this is Erica and you wonder why I
don't want woman well woman in charge of
anything
okay I think that's too far too far
Erica you've gone too far
uh but let's live in the real world who
in the world could do both of those
things well
nobody
nobody it's not a man or woman thing you
know women happen to be the ones who you
know bear the children so you know they
end up and for other reasons they end up
I guess having a big role in the child's
life as they should
so I don't see how you can do both do
you
how in the world could you do both
and do you do you imagine that New
Zealand
got a good job out of her
I mean maybe he was good enough
I don't know but it doesn't matter what
the external uh what the external let's
say competition for the leader's time is
whether it's a baby or they've got
lawsuit problems or they're having
troubles at home it matters it all
matters
so if we're if we're being uh
open-minded about this
I guess the right place the land is
everybody should have the opportunity to
try anything they want
and if it doesn't work out it doesn't
work out so yeah I don't think there's
any judgment to put on this
do you
I wouldn't put any judgment on it it's
just a thing that happened
well the New York Times has a story and
because it's in the New York Times
that's actually the big part of the
story
if this were some obscure publication
who had the following story I'm going to
tell you about it wouldn't mean much
but because it's in the New York Times
that's
it means it's uh let's say it's reaching
common
or because of the story is now a common
story or a common understanding and it
goes like this
hacking the simulation
so there are some serious people and one
in particular
I guess it was a was a professor or a
true scientist computer scientist David
Anderson
and during the pandemic he did some
noodling on if we're in a simulation
so if our so-called reality is a
computer simulation could you hack it
from the inside
now I don't think the article is very
interesting so I'm not going to get into
the details but
do you think if we're a simulation
that we could hack it from the inside
because here's my take on that
if that's not true
that were a simulation and you can hack
it from the inside I can't explain my
life experience
because I've been using this thing
called affirmations
that apparently hacks the simulation
and
you know the list of things that I've
affirmed that actually happened in the
real world is so wild
and you only know some of them
you know there's some that are just
private the private ones are crazy
crazy like you would you wouldn't even
and and you know even recently like I'm
not even talking about in the distant
past you know something worked out for
me once I'm talking right up to this
week
crazy and
I'll just put this out there if we live
in a simulation and that's not
guaranteed
and if we can hack it and that's
certainly not guaranteed
my best instinct is that the
affirmations or the amount of basically
the amount of focus you put on the
things you want to happen
might make reality fork in that
direction
so
one possibility is that all
possibilities exist
and they're all here at the same time
do you know how
[Music]
animation works
animation is a series of still pictures
that if you were to put them together in
let's say a pages of a book and then you
flip through the pages it would look
like the animation is moving which is
how you do movie TV animation
now
I've always imagined that our reality
is a three-dimensional Cube
in which you know conceptually let's say
you're somewhere in the middle of the
cube and your direction of the future is
every direction so you have infinite
directions from where you are and each
of those directions looks exactly like
our reality with a small change
and the small change is based on
whatever you know whatever path you you
take
now
my understanding of reality or let's say
the standard understanding reality is
that you're a conscious being
and you're in this big moving machine
reality is is moving all around you and
you're also moving so it's a bunch of
moving stuff
what if the only thing that moves is
your point of view
that's how I see the universe that it
all exists and always has and there's no
time
it just sits there all of the
possibilities as a solid cube
and the only thing that's changing is
your point of perception and which path
you follow
and nothing else changes the universe is
static
and always has been
and that the Big Bang
the Big Bang is simply a location within
the cube
it might be the middle
Imagine The Big Bang is the middle of
the cube and from that middle all the
possibilities and they just sit there as
a solid
and you're it's only your mind or your
you know you can say your soul or
whatever is passing through it and as
you pass through it it appears to be
moving but that's because your conscious
went through a series of Still Still
frames
now the reason that I uh mention that
frame is not because I think is
necessarily true
but it would perfectly explain how you
could hack reality
because you wouldn't be changing
anything
except your direction
and how hard it would be to change the
direction
of a mind
that is not bound by a physical laws
maybe easy right and it might be it
might be as easy as dreaming it might be
almost something we do automatically
[Music]
so I just put that weird possibility out
there to spin your brains around a
little bit all right
it's going to get weirder this is going
to be one of the most interesting live
streams you've ever seen and we're going
to get to Trump persuasion
my sweet spot so wait for that
all right let's talk about Ukraine
persuasion
question number one
remember I said that I believe that
ukrainians would outperform expectations
at the beginning of the invasion and I
said primarily because of modern
equipment that they would get from NATO
and the U.S and that drones in
particular
would be the the things that made the
difference
but then other people said drones Really
Scott is really the high Mars
it's the high Mars that are making the
difference and then they're introducing
these new kinds of missiles called glsdb
so precise
it can hit the radius of a car tire
and it can hit a moving object within
150 miles and it can go around it and
come back in another Direction
so it can you know evade radar it can it
can do anything you want and it can hear
something under a bridge
right you could hear something hiding
under a bridge from the air
so so these apparently this is good
weapons and apparently these are heading
toward Ukraine
and that they would be especially good
for taking out supply lines
now remember I told you that
I feel like Russia has a real problem
because they won't be able to supply
as long as Ukraine can you know drone
their supply chains from the air
so that's what they're doing you know
they're doing exactly what would be
obvious
but here's my question to you what is
the definition of a drone and would you
call a high Mars uh yeah the rocket that
comes out of it and the
glsdb systems would you call those
drones
here's a definition of a drone
any unmanned aircraft or ship that is
guided remotely
uh or or it could be autonomous
so in other words you can control it
directly or you can give us some
instructions to do something and it goes
and does it that's a drone
I think the high Mars and the glsdb
systems are drones
well whenever I talk about this all of
the the Russian assets
start start yelling Scott Ritter
you can tell all the all the Russian
assets
Scott Ritter and and also wrong and big
letters
this is so easy to pick out the Russians
now
anybody else want to say Scott Ritter so
we know who all the Russians are go
ahead
let's see if I can quiet him down
Scott Ritter literally writes for the
russian-controlled uh publication RT
which is called Russia Today
so do I think this Scott Ritter would
have a different take on whether Ukraine
is winning huh
why don't we see what the guy who works
for Russia thinks hmm
hmm
and Andrew says and who do you write for
copy well you nailed me burned burned
who do I write for whoa whoa well as you
know I write for UT
oh you didn't know that I write for
Ukraine today
the publication that's owned by zelenski
yeah no I talk to him every day
hold on he's calling again
you want me to write one
right Ukraine has nuclear weapons you
don't have nuclear weapons okay I'll say
you do I'll say you do I will do an
article on that uh you know there's talk
that they have nuclear weapons anything
else
f-15s
you don't have any okay I'll say f-15s
F-150s you got hundreds of them hundreds
of them thousands thousands of f-15s
all right
I got my assignment
got it right for zielinski
now for the dumb people
that was just theater and I don't
actually write for Ukraine
but I think it's funny that you asked
anyway I would just like to make the
following Point
um I I can see why you would call these
missile systems not necessarily the same
as drones I get it but I wasn't making
that distinction when I talked about it
laughs
my trolls are just so pathetic today you
know when the trolls are doing a good
job and they're like getting under your
skin
like they're annoying but when they do
an unusually bad shot
they just become part of the
entertainment and today they're totally
entertaining it's the same same person
anyway that's pretty funny
um let's talk about everybody
weaponizing everything
so you know the Republicans are doing
this investigation into the
weaponization of the Intel community
and now the Democrats are going to match
that persuasion by saying that the House
Republicans are setting up a committee
to
um that the it's the Republicans that
are weaponizing stuff so everybody is
weaponizing
is that good persuasion
to say everybody's weaponizing stuff
I don't know
it feels a little generic doesn't it
a little bit generic I don't think the
weaponization thing is
quite hitting but we're going to talk
about uh Trump's recent statements I'm
going to show you how to do it right
yeah and I want you to contrast
the the weaponization word
with where Trump goes
so you can see you can see the weak
sauce and then you're going to see Trump
just just punching it right in the
 face
now whether you like it or not
he definitely has
a skill
a very specific skill set we'll get to
that a little bit
all right
um apparently Trump is reportedly NBC
says going to come back to Twitter and
he's petitioned Facebook to go back
there as well now Facebook would have to
say yes Twitter already did
but he's not back so we'll see if that's
real I think most people assumed that
running for office would require it
don't you think
now I don't know what that does to the
viability of Truth social so that's
going to take a hit but
um I saw a
sir comment
um about Trump's support of his work to
bring the vaccinations out
now how many of you think that's going
to be just a huge problem
that that Trump was behind operation
warp speed
and that
a lot of his base is pretty unhappy
about vaccinations so how does he solve
that is that solvable
you tell me because I was solvable for
his base
yeah it is solvable I wasn't sure how
but he he's he's putting together a
package of persuasion in which this
folds into it really well
and
I almost hate to say it
because you know this time around I'm
not going to support Trump on you know
his policies except one he's the
strongest one in fentanyl he would go
after the cartels he says I mean so so
far that's that's the best take
so I'm going to talk about his
persuasion skills if you can be uh let's
say alert enough to know that doesn't
mean I support everything he says and
does right I'm a one one policy you
voted at this time just on Fentanyl
but
um on Hoodwinked on Twitter Twitter user
on Hoodwinked
who's also a good follow very
provocative tweets if you'd like to
follow somebody interesting
and he says uh and this is and this is
why Trump won't be re-elected talking
about his support of the vaccinations uh
he continues to fail to read the room on
this issue
and he says it wasn't an accomplishment
warp speed meaning it was a hyper hyper
rushed departure from safety protocols
on an experimental drug administered to
Millions with our full-informed consent
how many of you would agree with this
statement I'll just read it again agree
or disagree with this statement warp
speed wasn't an accomplishment it was a
hyper rush departure from safety
protocols on an experimental drug
administered to Millions without full
informed consent
boom agree agree agree
all right
may I offer a counter point
right I'm not going to try to change
your mind
if that makes you feel better
because I don't think I need to right I
I feel like you've all made up your
minds and
you can stay there but wouldn't you like
to see the counter that just out of
curiosity
do you think there is any counter to
that point
all right here's my counter to the point
it was fully disclosed
and it was not mandatory
let me say it was not mandatory from
Trump
there were definitely mandates but Trump
is anti-mantic
now you're saying that it was rushed
and it did not meet the normal safety
protocols who didn't know that
we we were told that directly and daily
every single day
everyone knew
that you can't know what will happen in
five years if you've only tested for six
months or whatever it was
there anybody who didn't understand the
vaccinations at a risk and and is there
anybody who didn't understand that the
risk was more than normal
anybody
so would you say there was an informed
consent I've never seen more informed
consent
or well informed the consent part is
optional I've never seen more more
information
that this was not the same safety
protocol as before and I think we were
told directly
consistently and often
that we also don't know how bad the
virus itself would be so we're looking
at two unknowns and we're taking our
best shot
but nobody nobody was presented with
safety
not not a level of safety that was
consistent with the past
right so the informed consent thing is
ridiculous in my mind because I was
informed
why were you not informed I was totally
informed
do you remember that I waited from the
time that I was eligible which was early
on because my age
I waited I don't know six months or so
do you remember why I said I waited
I said because they're telling us it's
not as safe as regular things of the
past
I waited because they told me
they informed me
it might not be a safe
and that I acted according to my own
desires and wishes
you don't think Trump can defend that
yeah you can yeah you can now here's the
part you're missing
everything is compared to something else
no matter who no matter who Trump runs
against
he's going to look better on this
because there's nobody everybody has
something to explain about their actions
right everybody
including me
everybody has something to explain
he's not going to run against somebody
who has less to explain
he's only going to be running against
somebody who's probably pro-mandate
right I mean it's not even going to be
close if your only choice is a
pro-bandate and an anti-mandate
he wins
he owns it now he has he's barely even
tried to defend himself he's just you
know said we did but all he'd have to do
is say what I did
every one of you people complaining knew
there was extra risk that's why you
didn't get vaxxed you can't
simultaneously say we all knew there was
a risk
and then say you weren't informed
you can't say both
everybody who told me they didn't get a
vax they said it's because it was very
clear from day one this was not the same
risk profile as the past right
so how can you argue both sides I
totally knew what the risk was and it
was more than normal
and nobody told me the risk
pick a side you got to pick a side
so
like I told you I'm not going to
convince anybody to change their mind
about this I'm just saying that Trump
has he's got a freeway right through it
I mean he can slice through this like a
hot steel through butter
it just doesn't feel like it because it
hasn't really ramped up yet
but he will he will now he could also
blow it right I mean he could say the
wrong thing blah blah he could
but where do you see what else he's got
cooking
oh this gets better
this gets so much better
and it's it's going to really challenge
me to stick to my you know single single
issue vote and you know not get involved
in his other opinions
but he's got something that he's sort of
he's signaled today or yesterday that is
really cool persuasion wise all right so
again I'm only talking about his
persuasion game that's the part that
always impresses me you know not
necessarily the policies
so here's what uh
Trump has decided to do let's see uh so
he's tweeting about the empty folders
and you're going to say to yourself but
Scott this is a different topic
the the empty folders and the
vaccinations totally different topics
right
they were
watch what Trump does to the empty the
empty folders all right now here's
here's what he said he posted on Truth
social
uh that the the empty folders were
marked classified uh and then he
explained that it was common for the the
folders to have con you know contents in
them during a meeting
and at the end of the meeting
to keep these classified documents safe
they would collect up the documents but
not the folders
because the folders were unnecessary
because they were just going to maybe
destroy the extra documents probably
because they had copies
and so Trump says that you know he had
hundreds of them and he kept them as
cool keepsakes does anybody believe that
does anybody believe he kept empty
documents as cool cool keepsakes
I don't think so
I doubt it you might keep one
you might use three of them
if he said I kept three of them as a
Keepsake I'd say maybe
but they're literally just folders with
words on them why would you keep 300 of
those
so I I can't support this take but he
uses this to suggest that maybe the bad
people in the FBI would put something in
one of those folders to make it look
like it was always there
now who knows if anything like that
would happen but uh I think we'd all
agree that the FBI is not above it
would you I mean that's an it's it's an
outrageous claim
that the FBI would you know possible or
somebody else would possibly plant
classified documents just to put it away
that's outrageous
and also well within uh the range of
things they've done recently
totally within the range
so this is the sort of thing that 10
years ago if you said the FBI is trying
to frame me wouldn't you laugh at that
well I think the FBI is trying to frame
the president no they're not
but today
yeah it looks totally within the within
the realm of
very reasonably possible
now I don't think so I'd vote you know
if I had to bet I'd bet against it but
totally within the range of possible so
Trump puts it out there just to you know
just to keep that in your head
because he knows some people are going
to believe it
but here's the best part
uh
he said that uh oh he referred to the
FBI agents as Gestapo
Gestapo
do you see it yet
I think he's going to Brand the
Democrats and the FBI
as the real Nazis
God I hope so
if there's I'm not a Believer but just
once I'm gonna pray
Dear God
please let him just brand the Democrats
so the FBI is the real Nazis
and just like hammer it to death
and please if I can ask for one more
thing would you ask him to address
directly the fine people hoax don't say
a word about it just create a good
little video that shows it's a hoax and
tweet it
that's all
that's all I ask
what is Trump's biggest problem
they think he's the Nazi
right
do you think you could brand the
pro-mandate team that sends people in to
uh you know
rile let's say everybody from Roger
Stone to you name it you don't think he
can brand them as Nazis
they want to take away your guns give
you mandates
give power to the wef
oh yeah
yeah and
if you told me there's going to be a
politician running for office and he's
going to go branding his enemies as
Nazis what would you say
you say I don't like that guy
or or woman
uh you would say
no then no no no no no you know you
can't be branding your enemies as Nazis
this is the United States we're just
political we're not branding anybody as
a Nazi
but in this one case
it's exactly the right thing to do he
needs to Brand them Nazis
full out
and just say your Nazi hoaxers the FBI
can't be trusted it needs to be gutted
the leadership not the good people who
work there
and
he should just go for it
just go for it and I think he could win
I think he could win
what do you think
because his weakest point is hey blah
blah blah you're racist now let's say
let's say he took my advice which I
don't think will happen but suppose he
took my advice on how to frame the
Border
hey we're never going to agree on this
border stuff
let's get a bunch of economists to tell
us how many people to let in and when
and what types
and let's have it like the OMB you know
some
quasi-independent organization that can
just tell you if it makes sense
economically and whatever it makes sense
economically to the people who are
already here
we'll we'll open the door a little bit
and when it doesn't make sense should
that ever happen we'll close the door a
little bit but we're in a New World
Imagine imagine Trump saying this to
um just imagine him saying this to
conservatives you know this isn't the
world of five years ago we might
actually have a population problem in
the other direction
we might we might have too few people
then imagine and again he's not going to
do this but imagine he could
you know the people coming through there
we do have to worry about the you know
the criminal element
but let's not forget that the the people
coming here
tend to have conservative ideology
yeah their their family religion work
family religion work
you can let a few family religion work
people into the country without it
falling apart
you can you can let a lot of them in I
just don't know what the right number is
is it 5 million a year I don't know it
seems like a lot doesn't it
it seems like a lot but I don't know
that might actually be the right number
it might be low
I'm not sure if there's any way to know
that's why you need a independent group
to just you know help us get a feel for
the economics of this stuff
so Trump could because the situation is
a little different than it used to be uh
he could totally sell it as something
that should be decided by economics and
that the politicians should maybe
pull back a little bit so you're not
just blaming each other being racist
you can be uh Hispanic vote
you could
do you know how
if there's one thing
if there's one like common stereotype
that I hate to do stereotypes but this
one seems to hold up the Hispanic
Community especially you know one first
generation and second generation
they don't like a lot of
there's there's sort of a no
culture
do you know what I mean
they're not worried about your wokeness
so much it's just not on their minds you
don't think Trump could win a group like
that
all they'd have to do is offer him
something
now you know citizenship would be a
probably too much for his base but yeah
now and I also think
that you yeah and I think he could find
some way to have like a I don't want to
say second-rate citizenship for people
who are not yet legal but there probably
is something like that that his base
would live with
as long as the economic argument was
made if you could make the argument we
could keep the country safe enough and
it's good for the economy
I think his base accepts it and it also
accepts that it brings in people who are
more like them than the people who are
already here on average
uh not the second rate pay no not the
secondary pay of course
but you could have somebody who's uh has
most of the rights of citizenship but
may be short of voting
if you have somebody if you knew
somebody was here illegally
but also have a job they had a job
and how about couldn't own firearms how
about that so Suppose there were some
Caravans he said yeah they could totally
live here
but uh they they can't vote
they have you know they can get a
driver's license and do all the work
related things but they can't vote
and they can't own a firearm I'm just
picking two random things
could you live with that
if somebody made the argument that it's
in your economic interest
to allow more in but you know be a
little more careful about the vetting
could he live with that
now what what's the argument against
let's just take this as a hypothetical
because you need to teach me what
there's something I'm missing
there's something in my mental model
that's missing
is it just racism
no I'm saying if the people who are
already here legally
you know we have a long tradition of
Pardons and paroles and you know uh
reconstituting people who are in prisons
and retraining them we have a long
history of uncriminalizing criminals
that wouldn't be new
so that's not your objection right you
wouldn't object to the general concept
there's somebody who's who's minding
their own business but broke a technical
law but they're adding to the country
you wouldn't allow them to have maybe a
second class citizenship
which would you know permanently
keep them in you know not full
citizenship but they're adding to the
country and they want to be here and
their and their kids would be full
citizens and blah blah blah no
somebody says you can't have
second-class citizens yes you can what
are what are children
children are second-class citizens what
are illegal
you know immigrants are not citizens but
but you know basically we always have
classes
you know what are billionaires are you
the same class as a billionaire who
would that's not an argument you can
have all kinds of classes of people
in a democracy
join the military yeah maybe they can
join the military in certain
circumstances
all right so
um I need you to educate me
if if you could handle the economics
and you could check them out better so
that you're reducing the criminal
element if you could know that they're
paying tax is right if you knew they
were paying taxes and adding to the
system
and and independent economists said yeah
we could let in a few more
and let's say Trump agreed to it
tell me the problem with that it's all
hypothetical right I'm not saying that's
the situation
right but but if they were LED illegally
legally what would be your problem
yeah pay they pay for their own health
care right they would just be like us
with a few fewer rights Maybe
their kids vote view vote blue
I I think you should check that
assumption do you know why the kids vote
blue
because Red's never tried to incorporate
them the moment red says you know what
we like workers we like we like uh
people like families we like religion
you know what we love you guys
they just have to say the words
because in fact they do
you you pick you pick show me any
Republican in Congress
pick any Republican and say all right
look at this guy
this guy is you know loves his family
he's working hasn't broken any laws
just wants to be an American
you have a problem with that person
like really like that's your problem
the person who's living the ideal life
that you wish everybody would live
so if you think that they're all going
to vote blue blue when you could be
right
just don't give them the vote
by the second generation they're going
to be Republicans
the second generation will just be
Republicans because by then the
Republicans will will have figured out
how to deal with this community in a
more productive way and the Republicans
have a perfect way to do it
how about we just agree with your
you know your character and we reach
some agreement about the economics and
who can vote and who can own a gun
and then we're all good
I don't know so the only thing I'm going
to try to convince you of
is that there's a third path on
immigration that's neither Democrat nor
Republican and it's the right one
it's the one that makes sense
all right so uh let me acknowledge
everybody's yelling legal legal legal
the people who are saying because
they're illegal you should give them
nothing
do you do understand that we have a long
tradition of making legal people who
were illegal it's an ordinary thing we
do all the time
so that's not really an objection that
makes sense on a any logical or other
basis we do it all the time and the
reason we do it is for our own benefit
right
we wouldn't be doing it for the benefit
of the criminal we'd be doing it for
ourselves
I I want I want everybody to be paying
taxes don't you
why wouldn't you
so yeah
all right I'm just going to put it out
there as something that could be
improved in terms of the messaging but I
do like uh Trump saying that mandates
are going to be that's what the Nazis do
to you I just gave you options and then
when they say but but but you gave us
this risky vaccine then Trump says who
didn't know it was at risk
we could not have been more clear about
that
and I would agree
he also says China is buying up all the
all of our assets there's something to
that but I don't know what the extent is
all right here's my provocative thought
for the day
wouldn't you agree with the following
statement
that the social media platforms
if their algorithms are favoring you
know one political side or the other
that effectively they're running the
country
would you agree with that statement
that the algorithms could program the
country so effectively based on what
they see
that the algorithm ends up running in
the country and not you know Congress
and not the vote Congress ends up just
you know going along with whatever
social media forced into the thing
well
your provocative thought of the day the
world economic forum is just an
algorithm
it just happens to be a physical one you
could look at here's why what an
algorithm does is decide what you see
and how often right
that's all it does an algorithm decides
what you see and how often
what does the world economic Forum do
let's say you went to the world economic
forum and say you know I'd like to have
a
a presentation there
and I'd like it to be on the topic of we
should use more fossil fuels
do you think they'd say you know we like
we like opinions on both sides so yeah
here's here's a full platform for you to
say your thing that's opposite of what
we usually say and we'll give you all
the attention you want because we like
balance
do you think that's happening
I don't think so I think that the world
economic Forum decides what they present
and also who attends
they didn't invite me
did they invite any of you
right so if they can decide who's in and
who's out
at least they can decide who they invite
and they can decide what information
from their attendees you know Rises to
the point where it gets promoted
and what doesn't
they're an algorithm
they are a physical algorithm and that's
how they can run the world
because all they have to do is control
the information that they allow to be
promoted through them
and then they get everybody on board and
they get their people in in office and
everybody's like oh I better make these
World economic Forum people happy
because they invite me on excellent
vacations in Switzerland I love
vacations in Switzerland
and I get like luxury accommodations and
I get to meet all these other people and
all I have to do is do what they want
and then I get all these benefits
yeah if the and the beauty of it is that
because it's an organization
they use the fact that they have members
who are the members the ones who are
surfacing all the ideas
so the illusion is that there's some
kind of
quasi-democracy group
grouped decision making so it's not
Klaus oh no no it's not Klaus
he's just like the organizer guy it's
all these individuals who collectively
nothing like that's happening
because somebody decided who's there and
of course they know what that group of
people is likely to say that's why they
got invited right they invited Al Gore
they didn't invite you know Alex Epstein
or Michael schellenberger did you see
Michael schellenberger anywhere at the
world economic Forum do you think he was
invited
do you I don't think so I don't think so
nope that he wasn't so the world
economic Forum acts just like an
algorithm on a on a social media
platform but if that's invisible to you
you easily get fooled into thinking of
some it's it's all the smart people who
got together and then came up with smart
ideas
and then Only the Good smart idea is you
know filtered up and and so you're
seeing the best of the best it's like
the the smartest most connected people
and all their best ideas that's how it's
presented
is it no it's probably Klaus or maybe a
handful of people
who decide what's in and who's in
and that's it
it's just like an algorithm
so it is an algorithm that can control
the world in those elements you know
those areas that they want to which are
primarily Financial
which is really everything
if you control the finances of the world
what else do you need
you don't you don't want to control
their military do you let's just work
you don't want to control who picks up
the garbage do you
that would just be work
no you want to control the economy of
everything
and then you get your cut
you have your power you have your
influence and basically the economy
influences the military and everything
else
well apparently Greta has been caught
faking a staged arrest so we've seen the
video as there look as she's laughing
and joking with the people who are
allegedly going to drag her away
and you know they're all putting on a
show
I don't really mind that if that doesn't
offend me
because the whole point of activists
getting arrested is for the cameras
right
so the fact that you know she's so she's
such a celebrity that even the people
arresting her or just having a laugh
with her and you know they're they're
just preparing the camera angles so that
when they drag her away it looks good I
don't have any problem with that no
problem at all
um do you
because you know all activists are doing
it for a theater that nobody's
pretending right they don't pretend
they're really going to jail for a long
sentence or anything like that
so I don't know if as long as it's all
theater I don't care
um I saw Al Gore getting very worked up
at the world economic forum
and uh just shouting at the world about
how they're not doing enough about
climate change
now
whether or not he is right or wrong a
separate conversation and worthy having
but here's my problem you know as as
many have noted
uh
he doesn't act the way he talks
in other words he takes private jets and
you know lives a
lifestyle that uses a lot of energy he
would argue that he bought carbon
offsets by the way do you know that
I think he did
so I think he used some of his vast
recent money to buy carbon offsets
which is not a problem
I'm actually going to give him a pass
for that did you know that
by the way I could use a fact check on
that but I believe you know he was quite
aware that he used more energy than the
average person and I think he just went
to the whatever Market there is and he
bought now the the thinking behind that
is that if you create a free market for
buying and selling carbon offsets or
yeah I guess that's what it's called
that eventually that drives everything
down to a more efficient you know less
carbon producing world and I I think the
logic if that makes sense
so in theory he is being consistent
by doing what he says some people will
have to do which is by carbon credits
and maybe that's the best you can do
but here's the problem
if Mahatma Gandhi had been fat
do you think he'd been
just as effective
do you
hey everybody uh
I'm really fat and happy but you know we
should date the British no he had to
starve himself literally near death
to be credible his credibility came with
his suffering that was equal to or
greater than the people who represented
that's a problem persuasion wise for Al
Gore because he's clearly leading living
a
a more awesome life than the people he's
trying to get to give stuff up
right if a rich person tells you to give
up your stuff you're not going to take
that well
if somebody who's suffering more than
you and has less of you he basically
lives in a you know one dirty diaper
uh you're gonna say all right well if
you can do that I can give up a little
bit you know I can take on some risk to
get rid of the British rule or something
so that's definitely working against
Gore is that
um even though I think he's on a
logically solid basis
uh people don't work on logic it just
looks like he's not he's not walking the
walk so that'll be a problem
um
yeah let's see what else are you all
aware of the uh
Stephen Crowder versus The Daily wire
controversy
I don't know if that's
risen to your attention yet so I'll give
you all right a lot of you not so
Stephen Crowder recently I think I have
the details right
um recently out of his contract with the
Blaze and he always I think
independently produced his show so he
can just do his show with or without any
other platform
but the daily wire realizing that he was
a you know a superstar in their in their
domain made him an offer and uh there
was one element of the offer that he
objected to and he talked about it on
the air he didn't name the entity that
made it but everybody figured it out in
about a minute
so
I was asked who was winning the uh
persuasion
because on one hand it was a very
generous offer 50 million dollars over
four years but he would have to do his
own production so that 50 million would
have to pay for his production costs as
well so let's say that I don't know
takes 10 or 20 percent off of that it's
still a real big number and then an
option for two more years at the same
per year price
now the party objected to was there was
some language in there that if he gets
um strikes or bans on other social
platforms you know let's say Facebook or
Twitter or something that they would pay
him less money
so there would be penalties in there for
getting banned on platforms and he
always gets banned on platforms like
he's always getting strikes and stuff so
he he thought that that was uh
I don't know what word you'd use
inappropriate
or unfair or too much control
too much control right probably
but he thought that was sort of icky and
don't don't talk like that
we don't like those words
um
so
uh over 10 million per year you know
after expenses probably
uh and I'll tell you the most
interesting part of the story well so
first of all here's my persuasion
analysis I thought they both won
you don't see that often but I think the
daily wire
um and Jeremy boring who you know did a
video about it I thought he totally came
off looking great
because in the in the process of
explaining the offer they made
uh he also got to explain how how
substantial their operation is
and I wasn't fully aware of that and I
thought wow that looks like a really the
the daily wire
as a business model and as a new
business is really something to behold
it
I think they do everything right
like just everything it's one of the the
few companies you can look at and say
all right it looks like they just keep
doing all the right stuff and they're
they're growing and now they're going to
make movies
and here's how they explain the movies
they're going to make because they want
to be a media entity not just a you know
a bunch of podcaster types the in the
movies they make are movies you you want
to watch
isn't it funny that that's like a real
thing
that somebody saw an opening for making
movies you'd want to watch
last night I tried to find a movie I
wanted to watch
I ended up with a movie from like the
early 90s
that I had already seen
that's it like there wasn't any movie
currently out
that wouldn't make me uncomfortable
right because if you turn on any any
basically any movie it's going to be
somebody tortured in a chair somebody
lost their money somebody's loved one
died
I I don't get any entertainment from
that that's that's like stuff I run from
right you know the but you don't see
like sitcoms and funny comedies anymore
because that's sort of phased out so
so the fact that the daily wire
has a theory that they want to make
movies you might want to watch
it's pretty interesting and it's also
right on target Right On Target and some
TV shows I guess
but here's what I found out about uh the
daily wire they have six hundred
thousand subscribers
and they have 150 million I think it's
Revenue per year
that's really substantial and the part
about the subscribers is that that makes
them not to fully independent not fully
dependent on Advertising although
advertising is part of the model
everything about that smart everything
about that and the offer that they made
as uh Jeremy boring explained was a
first offer
so in the the normal give and take of
negotiating
they made an offer that apparently
Stephen Crowder did not like you know
there's one part of it that was just
totally unacceptable but instead of
doing what people normally do
a counteroffer
he sort of went public with it
now
does that make him a bad person well it
might make him a person who's not
experienced at negotiating contracts but
I think he has an agent
so you know I feel like you know maybe
there was a better way to handle that
but here's what I found out about
Stephen Crowder that I didn't know
um
he has about five million YouTube
subscribers
did you know that
five million
he's one of the biggest media Stars
in the world I had no idea like I you
know I was well aware of him I've seen
his content a bunch of times but I had
no idea I had no idea he was that big
and so when you see this 50 million
dollar offer
my first thought was are you kidding
like in what world does that make sense
and then I saw his numbers and you run
the numbers you go oh yeah actually that
that was actually a perfectly reasonable
first offer
perfectly recently he might have gotten
more in fact
he would have gotten more all he had to
do is push back a little bit and he
would have gotten more now maybe he
wouldn't have been satisfied
with the parts about you know if he uh
if he doesn't perform on social media in
some ways right
but he probably could have negotiated
that a little
there was probably a way to
you know make that work I don't know
because if he got kicked off of YouTube
that would be a big hit to the Daily
wire so why should they just accept that
risk without trying to mitigate it
now how they mitigate it
that could be a longer negotiation but
his best
in a traditional world
let let me give Stephen Crowder more
more credit than it sounds like I gave
him so far
in a traditional world you should just
negotiate these things privately go back
and forth and see what you can do
not go public all right the going public
part is the weird part but
he's Stephen Crowder
the rules don't apply to him
Russell Brand the rules don't apply
right there are a lot of people for whom
the rules don't apply Greg Gutfeld
the rule the all the rules don't quite
apply Joe Rogan the rules don't apply
right so when Stephen Crowder
goes public
and he says this you know huge solid
entity offered me a deal and then you
know certainly you find out what the
dollar amount is later
he's really making himself more famous
and looking more valuable which he
succeeded at
so here's the here's the persuasion play
after looking into this and just you
know being aware of their little fight
um I I came away with a much higher
opinion of Stephen Crowder's business
model and value of it
at the same time
I came away with a huge respect for the
daily wire just how they're running
their business
that's a win that's a double win
two wins now is there anything that
would stop them from still doing the
deal
no
absolutely not because they're business
people right
in in negotiations you do get you know
some bad feelings and stuff but if
you're you know a Jeremy boring or
you're uh you know Ben Shapiro
you don't think they know how to get
past a little bit of a tiff
you know but get back to business of
course they do of course easily easily
you don't think Stephen Crowder can say
some things about some people and then
get past it of course he can
so neither of them lost anything
zero loss on either side both of them
raised their profile
quite appropriately
win-win
when you see people
um seemingly having a conflict and
they're all high-end operators because
these are some these are people who are
killing it and they're independent
Fields well same field I guess So when
you say the fight you got to put a whole
different frame on it because they're
they're their world of options isn't
like normal people you know Crowder can
throw away a 50 million dollar deal
with confidence that it might get him
another one all right or a higher deal
or a better deal or something so they're
not like us
let's talk about uh uh dumb Joe Biden
and his I I can't stand it when he says
that people with the AR-15s they're not
going to be much good against the f-15s
that the American government has if
they're going to fight the government
ah number one
every country that the U.S military has
tried to conquer they had their own
firearms
that country won there's a reason we're
no longer in Afghanistan there's a
reason that you know
Vietnam kicked us out we're not really
good
at beating anything except the military
but when it comes down to like you know
getting into their homes that's sort of
a police thing
and there are not enough police in the
United States to handle all the
residents who have guns right the F-15
isn't going to strike your house
and you know the f-18s won't just won't
be part of anything now the part that I
like to add
is that if you're trying to keep an
American Tyrant from taking over and you
know turning it into a into a tyrannical
regime
that dictator would have to know that
all of their family would be killed in a
week
by the people who have guns
nobody's going to go after Joe Biden
but they'll kill Hunter within a day or
take him captive right
the hunter doesn't have a chance
now just to be clear I don't recommend
any violence especially against families
you know so I'm not promoting any of
this I'm just describing
if we actually got to a point where the
whoever was the leader of the country
wanted to you know turn it into a you
know a Nazi regime or something
the people with the guns wouldn't go
after the leader
but that leader could never go in public
again
and nobody in their family could ever be
in public again
who wants that that they would be
winning something they didn't want
it would be a terrible life you could
never go outside because somebody would
take a shot at you now
now an ordinary rational person
will not try to assassinate a political
leader just because they don't like
their politics
that's not what we're talking about
we're talking about like a like a
hitler-like entity taking over the
country
if that were to happen
we would all take a shot at the leader
we would just need an open shot
we would all do it I'd do it
I I would risk my life to take out my
Hitler I would just have to have a shot
that's all I might do myself you know
right afterwards so so I didn't have to
get tortured to death but we'd all do it
yeah
so every time I hear that oh those
AR-15s will be useless against
f-15s
I don't know what Hunter Biden's going
to do when when they got to round him up
and all of his family and everybody that
you like and all of your friends you're
basically going to lose everything
nobody you know will be able to go
Outdoors ever again
so good luck if you want to conquer the
country and have that kind of life so
it's a good disincentive
yeah that worked in Venezuela Venezuela
didn't have enough guns
yeah anything you do to compare the
United States to any other country is a
waste of time we're just not like any
other country
we're just not
um
yeah
read the screenshot
was screenshot
why does Joe provoke what screenshot
you retweeted the screenshot
I don't know what you're talking about
I retweeted the screenshot
oh the the 4chan thing all right yeah
4chan had a good uh rant on
on this
so you can see that in my Twitter feed
please reconsider what
why do they focus on the ARs because
they look like military weapons
I think all right ladies and gentlemen
that
is the conclusion of my prepared remarks
um and how many of you know what AR
stands for
how many
go ahead said what does AR stand for
uh somebody actually said assault rifle
it is not it is not assault rifle
but that was a
oh this is interesting
it's not automatic rifle it's ArmaLite
ArmaLite is it ArmaLite rifle or is they
AR for ArmaLite well ArmaLite is the the
a for sure
so it's not assault
it never was
Heraldo was funny
you yeah
I think you're totally missing the value
of Geraldo on uh the five
Heraldo is great on the five
because he gets them all worked up he
you know takes some alternative views
that you don't like you know he supports
them well I think I think Heraldo was
great on the five but I also think Juan
Williams was great because in both cases
they know their role right or all those
fitting a role where he's trying to be a
little provocative and you know get
something going that's his job
I think he does it really well I
absolutely love her although like he's
one of my favorite TV people
Brave as hell
uh can't get embarrassed you cannot
embarrass him
so I just love that stuff
but I understand he's he seems unpopular
because you think he's arguing against
the people you like but you know that's
the show
all right was there anything I missed
any uh topics I should have mentioned
and by the way let me let me just do a
little test with you
when I talked about what Trump could do
did it sound like it could win
we don't know what he'll do but did I
describe a path where he could just walk
into the White House
I think I did
yeah and again he's very unpredictable
he's going to do what he does
but I I think he I think he drew up a
plan
that if he's stuck to it you could walk
into the whale skin it looks like it
uh
yeah or I'm a light rifle I think is the
right answer
you're flooded with illegals
um
yeah okay
Amish rifle
who is advising Trump I don't know oh
how many of you saw Matt Gates on Tim
guest
highly recommended
Tim Tim uh pool does good work the the
Tim cast
this is another business model that I
have a lot of respect for even if you
just go to the timcast website
it's a really good website it's really
put together
like exactly
it just looks exactly right you got good
good advice or good help on that and
then the show itself looks like high
production and it's always interesting
but anyway so Matt Gates comes on and
I'm going to say something that uh I
want you to test you you tell me
you tell me if I'm wrong
but you have to watch Matt Gates on Tim
Poole if you've seen a lot of Matt Gates
he's usually just doing like quick one
minute hits for a media hit his one
minute hits are really good
by his long form where he can actually
you know expand on something
the best in the government
there's nobody there's nobody on either
side
who does long-form explanations better
than he does period
there's nobody in his class
now here's the thing that's just amazing
he went from as politically dead as you
could possibly be
to are you going to be running for
president and are you know would you
accept the vice president role if Trump
asked you and everybody wants to talk to
you and by the way you did that great
job with McCarthy and it's good that you
can work with him now everybody came out
ahead
you're the only one fighting for us
how did he do that
how in the world
did he pull that off
but he did pull it off am I wrong
is there anybody here who saw him on Tim
cast
and does not feel he's not only fully
redeemed politically
but he has some impressive power levels
there more than we've seen
and here's one of the other things that
he does consistently right that I don't
see other people doing consistently
right
he defended Eric swalwell from the Fang
Fang accusations
just just hold that in your mind
now he's consistent because he saw he
also defined Katie who who is the woman
in Congress who got there were some
pictures that came out and
Porter was that on a hill
Katie Hill yeah he defended her like you
know leave her alone basically that's
just her private life and now so here's
his defense of swallow and by the way I
didn't know this this was all new to me
so that tells you how bad my bubble is
you said that the Fang Fang thing uh the
affair anyway happened when he was a
single man
so that's a big deal because I thought
happened when he was married I didn't
know uh that's a huge deal all right
it's a huge deal for trust but also
happened when he was a councilman in
Dublin California
now
as Matt Gates described it
he described Dublin California as
nowhere California
he was a councilman in nowhere
California
I have a small objection to that because
I lived in Dublin
while he was a council member
yes I lived in nowhere California
and let me say this about Dublin
California it's one of the best towns in
California
it is fiscally solid
with really good schools
low crime
and you would definitely want to live
there right pleasanton's better it's got
a downtown Dublin doesn't have a
downtown
but you know if you live next to it you
get all the Dublin benefits plus the
Pleasanton benefits it's one of the best
places in the country honestly you know
um but living in Dublin's not as good as
living right next to it and then you get
all the the Dublin goodness
so
that's my defense of Dublin
but
um
but apparently he you know had an affair
didn't know she was Chinese spy as soon
as he found out he worked with the FBI
and got rid of her
I'm going to accept that
I accept Matt Gates's defense of uh Eric
swalwell and as Matt gay says you don't
you don't need any of that
to kick him off the Intel committee
because he was part of the Russia
collusion hoax I mean that's good enough
that's good enough to kick him off so
you don't need any of that it's just a
distraction and it also puts you in a
weird situation because you know there's
going to be another Republican you like
who has some kind of like sexual
impropriety
so just taking that stuff off the table
is the smartest thing a politician can
do
there's no other Republican who is smart
enough to do that
now don't you trust him more Matt Gates
Don't you trust him more because he
wasn't willing to to just take a
narrative
he rejected the narrative
I do
does it tell you that
um oh and he also admitted he got caught
on tape or video talking to AOC and he
said yes I talked to AOC I talked to
Elon Omar and who is the other one on
the squad
and the reason you talk to them about
you know whether that the Democrats were
going to walk out under a vote or vote
were they are going to vote with the
Republicans or not
so he had a reason to talk to him uh
Rashida talibia and was it yeah it was
Rasheed I think
I think it was Rasheed but
now how do you how much do you like the
fact that Matt Gates can occasionally
defend a colleague against really an
unfair attack and can also talk to them
and they seem to be able to respond to
him
and he can also talk to McCarthy
was it Presley oh maybe it was Presley
yeah I may have the third person's name
wrong you're right
um
oh uh you would have a strong border uh
the only way the economists making
decisions about who comes into the there
was a question here on YouTube the the
only way it makes sense
to have economists tell you who to let
in the country and when is if you
completely control the border so that's
just a given
under all conditions
we should tightly control the Border but
we should also decide how to let people
in separately so that's the problem we
make we keep we keep conflating how many
people to leave in with the physical
security
those should not be the same topic
one should be total physical security
second topic
Wendy opened the door
just like your house
you know you don't you don't say well
people might sneak into my house so I
won't have any doors or Windows
yeah nobody makes that decision
uh Trump versus Newsom who would win
well
I hate to say it might have to do with
you know mail-in votes and other things
that where the system would favor the
Democrats so probably the system
elements are bigger than the candidates
at the moment
maybe Trump could get past that
but I think the system decides who is
president not not the voters exactly
in our current situation
so if for example the total media shut
Trump out
then he couldn't be present
right so it's not up to Trump it's also
up to the system and how the system
works
but yeah yes I think it's at least a
coin flip
Trump versus nusup I think that's a coin
flip
with what we know today
how about let the wisdom of crowds
specify the number of immigrants
interesting suggestion
the wisdom of crowds are here let me let
me try to support your idea before I
give you an opinion so that would be
instead of asking the economists who get
everything wrong anyway which which is
the problem with my suggestion you let
the let's say the public
decide the problem is the public is uh
poorly informed
so you might you might need to limit it
to people who voted because they're
going to try a little harder to be
informed
but let's say the people who voted came
up with a number of people to come in
the good part about that is that the
wisdom of crowds would pick up how
people feel about it
and how people feel about it is actually
part of the question
because if you have a really bad
attitude about it you might vote
differently you might treat them
differently
so how they feel does matter and The
Economist might ignore how people feel
and just say oh the dollars are better
this way but if it were the wisdom of
the crowds where he just pulled the
public and he said should we let in
another million yes or no
then people would look around they'd say
well how do I feel
like does this feel like a risk to me
or not
because our our feelings are part of
that are part of the decision
you know if something makes you feel bad
it costs you that's a real that's a
price
so you can't ignore that and I think the
economist would ignore that whereas the
wisdom of the crowd is if we just sort
of voted on it would capture how we feel
and also a little bit a sense of the
economics as best we could
it's a good that's a good suggestion I
think that's a that's a productive
suggestion
all right
um
should cops attack what
uh Let The Economist suggest and the
people decide well there you go
there you go
that would be a twofer wouldn't it
that's not bad all right so the
suggestion is you let the economist make
their recommendation
but you don't follow it you you see how
the public feels first because their
feelings matter
you could easily imagine that the
economists say you know uh that this is
going to be a good good thing to let in
a million people and you can imagine
that the public saying you know I don't
feel comfortable with that
like I I see your numbers I just don't
feel comfortable with it for whatever
reason and then let and then maybe
maybe have the president have the final
vote
but then the president could look at the
economists
or it could look at the public
or could look at the both of them
still you probably want the president to
make the decision or congress I suppose
but I'd love to see it informed by the
public and The Economist
let the crowds specify in the economists
verify if you flipped it around
I think the public is better at
responding to the experts than the
experts are at responding to just like a
uninformed feeling
I think it works better economists first
but that's a good suggestion
I like all the suggestions that you know
at least make you think a little deeper
so that that's like a great suggestion
yeah tyranny blah blah
experts responding to feelings is how we
got lockdowns
Maybe
how much would you like to see me
interview Rob Ryder
would that be wild
no
really you said no
seriously
you don't think that would entertain you
or is it just you don't want to hear any
more from
oh my God
see here's why I would be the perfect
one to interview him
because I like him
I like him I know he's just likeable
like the stuff he says just looks you
know bad crazy but that's because
we're so Political Animals at this point
um but I know I would have a fun
conversation and I think we'd both
learned something
it actually could be useful might be
good for the country you never know
all right so
uh I'm still planning to do interviews
but probably once the real political
season gets cranked up because then I'll
have an unlimited number of people who
want to talk to me for politics
so I think I'll do them not live
because the the tech isn't quite ready
for Life yeah it would fail too often so
I think I'll do that not live and make
some recorded
videos the the people I want to talk to
are Trump
and I think Trump will do a lot of
podcasts
because that's that's really a strong
play he'll do that obviously I don't
know if you would do mine but he'll do
he'll do most of the big podcast he gets
invited to
and
do you think I could get Newsome
I mean I live in California and I would
give and here's the thing here's the
thing I would let all of them
show their best face
right it would not be my job to like
embarrass somebody
who who was nice enough to do the
interview I was certainly you know be
forceful in my
counterpoints but I'm not going to get
excited about it
Steve Cortez Steve you're recommending
him as a a guest
I love Steve Cortez everything he does I
like
um yeah I I don't think I would ask the
same questions as other people do you
I I think that my my questions would be
completely different than anybody else's
so that would be fun
um
I'm guessing that Scott would push
fentanyl well I would certainly mention
Fentanyl
Carrie Lake Matt Gates I'd love to talk
to Matt Gates
uh
see here's here's what I think you need
to do a good interview
the person you're talking to has to
believe that you're not there to take
them down
and I wouldn't do that because it would
be unfair
so I think I can convince people that
I'm there to let them show their best
life
Andrew Tate
Tate's not a political figure
I don't think
Nick Fuentes is a political figure at
this point
set up the chairs like Shatner did where
the chairs like need any
all right I'm just saying goodbye to
YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
you're all awesome it's the best live
stream you've ever seen
