hey everybody
come on in it's so good to see you it's
the best part of my day
every single time and i know it's going
to be a great one today
whoa is it going to be a great one it's
going to start out slow
and then it's going to build into a
crescendo
or possibly not but it will still be the
best part of your day and all you need
is a couple of maggots
let me start again all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tank or gels or
stein a canteen jugger flask of vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen to you
right now go
sublime all right a number of you said
that
my periscope live stream those of you
watching on periscope
um did not get a notification on twitter
yesterday i believe i have solved that
problem so you should have gotten one
today
and i think the problem is that when my
ipad reboots it disconnects twitter from
periscope
in other words they're separate apps
owned by the same company
but if they're not connected to each
other
uh twitter does not automatically send
out a notification
so they got they got unconnected during
a system update
on my ipad i reconnected them
everything's good it wasn't
suppression in case you wondered i have
a entertainment
recommendation for you you ready don't
you need more laughs
wouldn't your life be better if you
could laugh your way through the
pandemic
well if you haven't already watched it
and you're a south park fan i don't
recommend this
if you've never watched south park
before
and you might be offended by stuff
[Laughter]
so the following recommendation is with
the caveat
that if you know you like south park
you're really going to like the pandemic
special that they did so just google
south park pandemic special i was crying
i mean i was just crying watching that
thing and
the the great thing about south park
there's a lot of great things about it
but the humor is you know sophomoric
you know kind of just naughty humor and
by all by all rights
it should be not clever all right
it should be just this ah you know i
could have made that joke when i was 12.
but it's clever as hell and when you add
the
the sophomoric humor to extraordinary
cleverness i mean really
first rate you know best in the world
kind of cleverness
that combination just never fits which
is what makes it hilarious
you know the the the the artwork being
so
you know crude by design on top of the
humor being so crude by design
and then you add to it really really
intelligent writing
and it's just it's a freaking
masterpiece
but you have to like south park to to
enjoy it
here's something else i've mentioned
this before but i finished watching it
what we do in the shadows i hope i got
the right name for that
it's about vampires now i've said before
that humor is largely
dead as an art form because our senses
of humors are
are so distorted by political
correctness and everything else
so one of the genius things that south
park does
is during the course of the show this
this won't ruin it it'll
you know this is not a spoiler they deal
with the fact
that doing a pandemic comedy during the
middle of a pandemic when
people are dying by the hundreds of
thousands is clearly inappropriate
right making jokes about the pandemic
is clearly inappropriate and when you
watch the way that
south park deals with that head-on
it's just it's just brilliant um
but the other thing that you can enjoy
during the pandemic and
it's a very rare exception to the fact
that nothing's funny anymore
at least intentionally i've said before
that
scripted comedies are being replaced by
the news
because the news is hilarious and
entertaining in a whole
you know very rich way and when i watch
the news i do it for the laughs
and that's not a joke it's not i'm not
saying that for a fact i
actually do it for the laughs and it
delivers
but watch uh what we do in the shadows
it's about vampires and it's
really really clever here's another
recommendation
one of the great things about youtube is
that you can
it will make recommendations and then
just keep playing the recommendations
automatically if you set it up that way
um
one of the things that i've discovered
and probably you've all
already discovered it and i'm just the
last one to know
but if you watch a youtube about a
personality
it will it will automatically cue up
other content about the same person
and you can effectively create a
mini-series
about somebody that you think is
interesting and most of the comment
most of the the content does not overlap
so you can just listen to a whole bunch
of shows about one person
so i did that with paul mccartney and
john lennon it was really entertaining
because i'm interested in them you would
pick you would pick the people that you
would be interested in
i did uh a few other people
but uh most recently my favorite and
here's my recommendation
is uh norm mcdonald go to youtube
and just look at any any video that
features norm mcdonald and then youtube
will do the rest
it'll start recommending other norm
mcdonald's stuff
so if you just put it on nora mcdonald
you can listen
all day long and it never gets less
funny
and it doesn't really repeat there's
just a
ton of content with norman
mcdonald talking either you know on a
talk show or his own show
or people talking about him and even
the interviews of people talking about
him
are freaking hilarious and here's here's
the takeaway
i didn't realize this until i saw a
bunch of them
all at the same time if you watch one
clip of norm mcdonald you like it or not
like it
but you don't get the you don't get the
big picture and the big picture is this
i didn't quite realize it
although i had a hint that norman
mcdonald's humor is not like
other people's humor in a variety of
ways but the important way
is that the joke is on the audience
or if he's talking to somebody let's say
on a talk show
the joke is on the audience and the
other guests
and maybe the host and what he's doing
is
entertaining himself in front of you
and once you realize that's what he's
doing
you'll just cry in laughter every time
you see him do it
if you see it individually and you pull
up one clip
here's what you might see you might see
a joke
that makes you think wait a minute is he
a racist or something
because the way you told that joke i
mean it's not racist
but it's it's close to it
and if you hear one you think oh a
little worried about
norm there maybe he's you know got some
thoughts that are not so pleasant but
then you watch a whole bunch of them
and you realize that that's that's what
he's doing
he's making the listener uncomfortable
because you're supposed to be thinking
i don't know if i can laugh at that i
think it's just a joke but i'm not
positive and once you realize he's doing
that
to the audience and he's doing it to you
and he's doing it to the other people
he's talking to
and you and you get in that vein where
you realize what's going on
it is freaking hilarious and i was just
watching that yesterday and just crying
so funny all right those are my
recommendations for fun
have you noticed that everything became
about china
now of course the coronavirus came from
china
probably the coronavirus changed the
election result
i think smart people will conclude that
now it's not like one thing ever makes
the election what it is
you need lots of factors but one of the
variables that
everybody would agree is gigantic is
that we had more mail in ballots
and there is some science to suggest
that democrats are going to be more male
in ballot
centric and therefore would have an
advantage
that probably happened it's hard to tell
but probably china determined who our
president is
think about that not necessarily
intentionally
but yeah i'm not i'm not going to buy
the idea that
china intentionally launched a pandemic
i don't believe it was intentional
i think they could have handled it
better but so now
our biggest issues in this country are
all just
china and what did we do
in response to the fact that china
destroyed our economy
hopefully temple temporarily uh
infected and killed you know quarter
million americans
and effect it affected our election
again they weren't necessarily trying to
do it
a lot of you were thinking it was
intentional but it would be a weird
thing to do intentionally
i guess you can't rule out anything but
if it feels pretty unlikely to me that
it was intentional
so i don't think you could convince me
to that without more evidence
but everything's about china and what
did we do
as a as a response to the fact that
china
basically is controlling both our
political process
our economy and our health care system
and our trade right which is part of the
economy
but and what did we do
when we found ourselves in a situation
where china is
totally the dog wagging us like a little
tail
we elected the most friendly china
person
which is kind of the opposite of maybe
where we should have been
which is maybe we should have china not
affecting
everything in this country maybe they
should have
less effect but instead it looks like
they'll have more
which is an odd way to go historically
let me tell you the
uh maybe the saddest thing that's going
on here
joe biden is not really a friend
to black people but i think if you're
black
you can't you can't see it not because
you're black
it's not a racial comment but rather
anybody who's in a political
bubble it's really hard to get out of
your bubble
no matter who you are this this includes
you
includes everybody so everybody's in
their bubble
and i believe that once you get into
your head that there's an idea that's
just
true and let's say the idea in this
example is that
democrats are the party that are going
to be best
for the black population of this country
so once you've accepted that that's
true for decades whether it's true or
not you're accepting it as true
you really can't see counter evidence
so confirmation bias by its nature will
make it
invisible to you if there's anything
that would you know be
fighting against your world view let me
give you an example of some of the
things that biden
says he will do and now imagine you're a
black
voter in this country so you just
elected this guy
and then he's telling you what he's
going to do and he's not hiding it
he's telling you directly i plan to do
these things
right away top priority stuff
all right you're a black voter and he
tells you top priority we're going to
stop building the wall and loosen up on
immigration
all right so you're a black citizen of
the country
do you like that do you like that joe
biden has decided
that you're going to have a lot more
competition for jobs
because the immigration problem does hit
the black population harder
than other parts of the population
because the
competition for jobs at the at the lower
end
because unfortunately that's you know
that's our situation
so is that good for black voters did
they want
more competition for the jobs i would
think they would want the opposite but
biden is
promising them and that and if he is uh
takes the job if he ends up being the
president
he will give black people more
competition for jobs
okay how about the green new deal he
promises to do that is that
good if you're black nope
nope it's the worst thing in the world
if you're black is it good if you're
rich
and white it might be it might be
if you're rich and white you can afford
a little extra taxes and maybe you
maybe you want to reduce the chance of
climate change
disruption etc so maybe if you're rich
and you're white it could be good for
you
but one thing that's true all the time
is that your energy situation in your
country
largely drives your economy you can't
really have a successful economy
without a robust energy program
or being a special case right you could
be a special case
but in the united states our energy
program is central to
the health of our economy and if you
liked ultra low unemployment
under the trump administration before
coronavirus
do you like that the green new deal
guarantees
that the economy will suffer
because they'll you know they'll be
tough on fracking they'll be doing the
green new deal
so if you're at the lower end of the
economic
situation the green new deal is just bad
for you
maybe good in the long run maybe good in
80 years
it might be but if you're poor today
do you care about the green new deal in
80 years or do you want to make sure
that you get a job today
i feel like this is terrible for black
people the green new deal
even if it's good for the world which is
a separate argument
it's definitely bad for poor people
right away
how about biden looking to
put into place people who are part of
the school unions
and that's what he's looking for for his
education
you know cabinet member probably that's
that's the rumor anyway
which would indicate no school choice
what is the single
biggest source of systemic
racism nothing comes close to this thing
nothing which is that if you're black in
america
your odds of getting a quality uh
education
are way less than if you're you know
white in america
way less one way you could fix that and
maybe the only way
would be school choice and market
competition
because that kind of works all the time
whereas government
having a monopolies doesn't work all the
time
it can work in some cases so biden
is doing all of that so immigration is
bad for
black population green new deal is bad
for everybody who's in the lower income
including black population
and then school choice is like a
holocaust
in this country i mean it guarantees
that you have more systemic racism it
guarantees it
whereas if you said school choice let's
go crazy with school choice
let's fix this one thing nobody gets a
bad education
because they have a choice where to go
you could
you could take a gigantic bite out of
systemic racism if you
let's just define it for convenience as
starting from behind and then the ripple
effect that that has
in 12 years you know the length of
school in 12 years you could completely
transform
the black population of this country
economically
by making sure that everybody got a good
education
biden is guaranteed that that won't
happen because the system
he supports we know that can't get you
there it won't change that fast
here's another one suppose you were a
successful
black entrepreneur or just successful
in general and you're making a lot of
money so you're a black person in this
country
you beat the odds you you overcame
whatever discrimination
or uh systemic racism you overcame maybe
starting from behind you just overcame
everything
like you you figured it out and now
you're making a million dollars a year
in your business
or your your salary or whatever and
you're killing it
and you did that under the old rules the
old rules were what the tax rates used
to be
and the the way the law used to be and
you succeeded
against all odds you won
and then joe biden says i'm going to
raise your taxes to about 80 percent
if you add everything from state income
taxes and
states like mine california to federal
at 39 percent
12 for the state you add your sales tax
your property tax your payroll tax
other things that are like taxes and
suddenly
um your successful black entrepreneur
just used that as an example
suddenly everything that you worked for
joe biden can come and take a bunch of
it away
is that cool are you cool with working
your whole life under the old rules
you win and then somebody changes the
rules
after you win you're cool with that
i sure wouldn't be cool with it but i
can't speak for anybody else
and i'm definitely not cool with my own
case because i earned all of my money i
didn't inherit anything
i literally inherited zero
i worked for it now joe biden says let's
change the rules let's take that away
from you
not cool so uh certainly i have
great empathy toward the the black
opinion that i imagine they would have
if you if you were
highly successful you'd have the same
opinion i'm guessing
don't really know um i think the fake
news is already missing trump
do you see all the complaining about him
not coming out in public
so my understanding is that trump is
doing a lot
i mean he's making phone calls and stuff
he seems to be more engaged with the
election stuff
but i feel like the news is already
thinking
oh what are we going to talk about
if if trump doesn't come out and say
something in public pretty soon we're
just going to run out of
news because we might have to go look
for news instead of just reporting about
what the president tweeted
um
former cia director john brennan
tells cnn's wolf blitzer that he's more
worried than ever about trump
trying to you know stage a coup or
something like that
uh because i guess trump is replacing
some of the
civilian uh defense people with
loyalists they say which means making
people think he's gonna
try to stay in office somehow with a
coup
or whatever that's not going to happen
let me say it as clearly as possible
here's what's not going to happen
the president running a military coup to
stay in office
the odds of that happening are zero
they're not it's not like well there's a
long shot chance
no the odds of that is zero and here's
why
number one the military would never go
for it there isn't the slightest chance
in my opinion that he could get a even a
loyalist
to order some kind of a military coup in
the united states
so it's beyond ridiculous that that
could happen because the military just
won't do it
and there's no there's not the slightest
indication that they would follow those
kinds of orders
and there's lots of indications that
they wouldn't but
there's a factor beyond that i
i'm gonna i'm gonna make this assumption
and see if you
agree with it i believe there are 20
people
in the world who if those 20 people
said you know it's time for trump to
concede
we've supported trump in the past you
know vigorously
but now we 20 people or so
see that it's over hypothetically
it's definitely not over but if they did
there's 20 people who could absolutely
guaranteed make trump not the president
let me give you an example if sean
hannity
decided that he'd seen enough
information i don't think this is going
to happen i'm just
walking you through the thinking here if
sean hannity decided that he'd looked at
all the information
and said you know i love the president
but i'm looking at the information
and even with a little fraud it's not
enough to change the result
uh the process has been served and i
think it's time for the
the president you know my friend that
i've supported
to just concede so sean hannity
is certainly one of the 20 or so people
who if they decided that trump
is out of office he couldn't stay in
office
because he would need that 20 and the
people who follow that 20 which is you
know the bigger force
he would need all of them on his side to
have the slightest chance
of working any gray areas that could
keep him in office
all right rush limbaugh would have to be
in favor of trump staying on or he
couldn't
right maybe not by himself right if it
was an individual
important person who who was a rogue
you could ignore him but there are about
20
maybe fewer it could be 10 people
in the whole united states who would
you know have that kind of influence or
audience to do it
i don't know if i'm one of them but i
would nominate myself
as who you should look for in this
decision there will be a time
when as trump supporters many of you are
you will have to decide
have we seen enough is there no evidence
or
have we decided we're going to move on i
don't think we're there
i don't think we're there because i am
i'm aware not not in great detail but
i'm aware that there's more to come
in other words what you've seen so far
about the
credibility of the election is not the
good stuff
right i i warned you early on that all
of these little anecdotes
you're going to see 95 of them would be
debunked
but don't let that fool you
because confirmation bias guaranteed
there would be lots of false
false claims that was guaranteed it was
work it was just
part of the setup that that had to
happen because of the way our brains
work
but no matter how many are debunked that
doesn't tell you anything
about the ones you haven't seen
once you see them if they also get
debunked
well that's when you start saying oh
okay
you know maybe we've looked into it
maybe we know everything we need to do
here's why i would here's why i submit
that you should listen to
my opinion you don't have to take it of
course
but on the decision of whether
it's time or not time
to either support um that biden got
elected
you know at least support the outcome of
the election or
to keep keep digging here's why i think
you should listen to me
you know especially those who've been
watching me for a while
you know that i can turn on you right
you know that you could have an opinion
you really really care about
and you think i'm on your side and then
you hear that opinion and you're like
what the hell
what the hell is that i thought you were
going to agree with everything that
trump did nope nope i've never agreed
with everything trump has done
and i tell you quite often to your
distress
when it happens i'm not even a
republican
nor am i conservative i describe myself
as
left of bernie but better at math so his
programs don't make sense
because of the math but i like his
objectives
i like to get to full healthcare
availability in this country
so you know i like lefty stuff if they
can figure out some practical way to get
there which is
always where they they fall apart so
here's the point
you know me to favor systems over goals
and i could promise you
and i think you could trust this that if
it ever came down to supporting an
individual
let's say trump for example over the
integrity of the system
i will always pick the system
if i had to throw trump under the bus
love him as i do you know i like trump
i've met him enjoyed talking to him
i think he's done a great job for the
country but
i would throw him under the bus so fast
if the election system
indicates that that makes sense right
so i'm going to go with what makes sense
i'm going to follow the system
and i would like to have a good american
system when we're done even if
here's the important part you ready even
if
it means trump isn't president i would
absolutely choose the integrity of the
system
over any one president all right it's
not even close
i won't even i'm not even going to weigh
them as even being in the same category
the system is everything the individual
is not and and that's
that would be the approach i would take
so if you're listening to somebody who's
clearly just in the bag for the
president will agree with whatever he
says
you're not going to get anything
credible you know the fake news isn't
going to tell you anything useful
it's all lies because it's the news they
don't do the truth
you know the politicians are not going
to be unbiased
you know your fellow voters and
neighbors are not going to be
unbiased the one thing i can promise you
is that i will apply
reason i will imply i will give you an
uh an estimate of the odds of any facts
that i'm
incorporating and i'll tell you if it's
time to move on
i see no reason that you should listen
to me
to be honest i see no reason you should
listen to me
but who else are you going to listen to
years ago
i'm going to tell you something that
maybe it was a private conversation so
maybe i shouldn't
but i'm going to do it anyway all right
several years ago i was talking to my
friend
naval ravikant and i told them that my
objective because a lot of people ask me
why am i getting involved in politics
and why am i
why why am i even in this field
and i told him at the time that it was
my goal to be the most
credible person in the country credible
doesn't mean right
very important distinction credible
doesn't mean
that i'm right credible means
that you know what my intentions are and
that i put in the work
and there was enough transparency where
i showed you why i'm thinking what i'm
thinking
how i reasoned it what facts i thought
were credible what percentage i put it
on it
i can give you that so i've spent years
trying to develop um to develop let's
say a platform
in which what whether you hated me or
loved me
you would say damn it
at least he's credible let me give you
an example of somebody i consider
credible michael moore
right that doesn't mean you agree with
him it doesn't mean he's right all the
time
because that's not what credible is
nobody's right all the time
but when michael moore says uh hey
democrats
i don't think you're listening and trump
is
to the to the voters michael moore is
kind of credible
right maybe not on every topic but when
he says
stuff like that you know he can he's
capable
of leaving you know leaving the politics
and saying
uh but people are dying here and only
one person is listening to him maybe you
should listen to him a little bit better
too
pretty credible pretty credible
all right i don't know if i'm hitting my
mark but just so you know that's what
i'm shooting for
is to be a useful a useful component of
the country
in a world in which every one of our
systems has lost
credibility so who are you going to
believe and i think that
like i said i'm not alone there are
probably 20 people
who could who could basically
cause the president to have no hope of
holding on to the office
are we there yet nope nope we are
definitely not there yet
and i don't know if we will be but i'll
give you my prediction here's what i
think is going to happen
i think the president will make his case
that uh that fraud happened i believe
that he will eventually
and unfortunately it might take too long
i think eventually again
probably it'll take too long we will
know that the
election was maybe or definitely
illegitimate and could have gone or
should have gone to trump
and that will create a situation in
which even after
he has conceded if that happens
that we would consider him still the
president
because he got elected even though he's
not in the job
so you're going to have a situation
where you have two presidents
one official and then one sort of
in absentia if you will almost like a
venezuela situation
so that's what we're heading for because
everything's lined up for that to happen
um i don't know how long that'll last
all right
uh and the only reason that you know
that biden won
if that's what you think happened is
that the most
corrupt institutions in the country told
you it was so
right tell me who told you that binded
one
who is also credible
nobody you haven't heard it from anybody
credible
you've heard it from the news
fake news they're all liars you've heard
from politicians
you can't trust them they obviously are
playing the game
who told you that biden won who
is not already corrupt and non-credible
all right um i took a stand
in favor of uh jeffrey tubin who was
fired by the new yorker
i don't know if cnn will uh yank him off
the air
um but i said in a tweet apparently he
got fired by the new yorker where he
also worked as a writer and i tweeted
that i strongly disagree with this
firing
i don't want to live in a world i don't
want to live in that world
so what do you think people said
when i said that i disagree with jeffrey
tube and being fired
because i don't want to live in a world
in which you can get fired
for what is obviously a mistake now do
you think that people
correctly interpreted what i said no no
this is
this is the real world where people
misinterpret
so uh claire cullen tweets back at me
and she says you dot dot dot
want to live in a world where men
masturbate on camera
and work zoom meetings with no
consequences
weird and then she also tweeted
separately
what a hill to die on quote and then she
makes up a quote
as if i said it so it has quote marks
around it but i never said this right
i want to live in a world where men can
masturbate on camera
on work zoom calls free of consequences
did i say that
[Laughter]
is there anything i said that would
sound like i'm in favor of
masturbating on zoom no
no that would be a misinterpretation
of what i said a straw man if you will
i'm
the facts that we have are that it was
an accident
so am i okay with a man
or woman having an accident
which caused them great embarrassment
but it was just an accident
nobody got hurt no victims highly
unlikely to ever happen again
under those conditions man or woman
democrat or dem
or republican i don't care i just don't
want to live in a world
where a dumb mistake that had no
consequences
it really didn't let's let's be honest
the
the women who were on the call or men or
whoever else were on there
they weren't scarred for life because it
wasn't personal
it was just like an image on the screen
it wasn't meant for them it wasn't about
them
it was weird it was funny they're part
of history
i don't want to live in a world where b
where a simple technical error
can can lose a good job so i am
completely
sincere in saying that the new yorker
made a mistake in my opinion they should
hire him back
and cnn should not keep him off the air
indefinitely a little time out might
make sense for everybody
but i don't think anybody should lose a
job for that
douglas carr weighed in on this
conversation and
said uh douglas said quote i've never
unintentionally played with myself at
work or
intentionally so douglas claims that he
has never
gone full tube and at work whether
anybody was watching or not
to which i replied well maybe douglas
maybe you're just not that into yourself
because you know
there are times when i just can't resist
myself i don't know about you but
i am so into myself but douglas
douglas has rejected himself to the
point where he's not even interested in
in himself
apparently president trump has told
friends allegedly
who knows if this is true they want this
is from axios
that he wants to start a digital media
company to clobber fox news
uh although so it might not be a cable
channel
it might be just an internet only thing
to clubber fox news what are the odds of
that
well if he's not president
pretty high don't you think you'd watch
it
i don't know how you would not watch it
how would you not watch
president trump dunking on biden for
four years
i don't think i'd watch anything else i
don't know what could be more
interesting than that
so that might happen
again trump has two ways to win one is
he
somehow prevails with his legal
challenges and becomes president
for a second term and the second way is
he doesn't become president
and he makes you know billions of
dollars as the most interesting
conservative channel
so i've been asked to talk about dr
shiva's
analyses of the election and so i will
here's my problem trying to analyze
anything that
dr shiva does or claims
i can't i don't have those skills i
can't look at anything he does
and say oh well i agree with that or
don't agree with it what the hell do i
know
that's him working in a domain in which
he's an expert has several degrees
that are all relevant to this so
if he says he's done the analysis and it
tells them something
i don't know otherwise i don't know if
it's right but i don't know if it's
wrong
i just don't know so we need
people you know on both sides to be
looking at this stuff
so the claim from dr shiva is roughly
this i'll paraphrase it
that he can determine on a graph that
the
votes coming in for biden and trump were
somehow typical and appropriate
based on everything we know about the
past and and even what was happening in
the election so far
and then they would go along in what
would be a normal way and then suddenly
just like somebody turned to switch
as in a software uh thing then suddenly
it
just became albiden could there be a
natural reason for it
i don't know i imagine that's what the
other side would claim
but until lots of people have looked at
it it's hard to know
so i don't have an opinion about how
true it is
because i don't have the qualifications
to judge that sort of thing
and that's why i wouldn't want to have
him on as a guest
to talk about that sort of thing because
you should only do it if you've got
somebody who can
you know ask the right questions and
that's not me
apparently pennsylvania
asked the dominion software people
to make some changes before the election
and one of the
requested changes would give control to
a
an operator of the software to
mark blank ballots
any way they wanted and then just put
them in the system
so they actually asked for the ability
to fill in blank ballots
in writing that's actually a software
request
and i think dominion gave them that
ability so basically it's just
that an operator has the ability to do
what they want with a ballot
as opposed to the system somehow having
all the control
so don't we need to know more about
whoever had access
to that feature how many people in
pennsylvania
had access to a feature where they could
go in and just
change the vote wouldn't you like to
know
i'd like to know
um apparently biden is not getting
security briefings from the current
administration
and the reasoning is that he's not
officially the president-elect
but in the past that hasn't mattered
however i think in this case
it's humorously appropriate it's not
appropriate
government wise you know if you want to
just good government you should probably
let him have some briefings just in case
because he may not become the
president-elect
officially but i don't think there's any
risk
of somebody in his position joe biden
having been at the you know
top security clearance for what decades
probably
i don't think there's a risk in letting
him get some
some briefings but because uh the obama
administration
had screwed with trump that way and not
given him
the right briefings and they were they
were pretending as if he was a security
risk
i love from a humor perspective
that trump is not giving biden security
briefings because you could argue
you could argue that he's in the pocket
of china
right that was the argument for not
giving trump
security briefings as he might be in the
pocket of russia
so trump has 100
um reasonable
reason to not give biden these this
clearance
now i think it's more funny in fu than
it is
useful as a citizen i think he should
have those
uh briefings but as an observer of
politics it is kind of funny it is kind
of funny
so i appreciate it on that one all right
i think that we're watching the
slow motion self-immolation of the
democrat
democratic party and here is my argument
which i have not yet made and it goes
like this
if you're going to predict what would
happen if biden
eventually does get into the job as
president
what would happen between now and 2024
what is obviously going to happen
between now and 2024 so here's a few
things
keep in mind that trump did something
that nobody thought was even possible
he unified the republican party now
prior to trump being president i was
telling you he's so persuasive he has
these persuasive qualities and people
kept saying well why is he not
persuading democrats well we don't live
in that world anymore
we don't live in a world where you
persuade the other side
that's not even a thing you just
persuade your own team and if you can
get a hundred percent of them are close
on your side that's might be enough to
be president
so the president had unusual skills and
he could get
96 percent republican support
do you think that biden has those skills
given that he's dealing with the green
new deal
people and the squad
well i don't think that biden has the
skills
that trump has trump could
do things that other people can't and he
got his team completely on his side
biden probably isn't going to do that
because he doesn't have that kind of
game
so the first thing that will be
different is he won't be able to unify
the party so this is my prediction
so that's trouble secondly the things
he's pushing for are higher taxes
not withdrawing troops more systemic
racism
yeah the examples that i gave you
earlier like no school choice etc
that's pro-systemic racism uh
and more lockdowns now even if lockdowns
are good they're unpopular right
so even if you said oh they're necessary
the public doesn't like them
so the public isn't going to like any of
this higher taxes more war
systemic racism lockdowns then
there's talk that he might want to share
the pfizer vaccine overseas
before everybody in america gets it
because that would be
fair and it might be you know if you're
being a
citizen of the world does it make sense
that maybe you share your limited
vaccine with the rest of the world
i think you can make an argument for
that the argument would not be america
first
it would be the opposite of that but
could you make a philosophical argument
and maybe this will happen that the
any vaccine that's so important it's a
world problem
that we should not hog at all you can
make that argument
but it won't be popular you know the
people in the united states
are going to complain so that's you know
not going to look good in 2024 i think
you'll get more riots
anybody who thought that the rioting
would decrease under biden they're
probably asking themselves uh what
happened
so biden is going to have that i don't
think um
that you've got a nuclear problem a
nuclear energy problem
biden i believe is at least
nuclear curious if not flat-out
pro-nuclear at least keeping the ones we
have
he's going to run right into the squad
on that and the green new deal
so what happens if biden is pro-nuclear
and the squad is not what happens if
biden has
age-related problems do you think
there's any chance in the next four
years he'll have
age-related problems and it'll make
democrats say
uh what did we do here it seemed like a
good idea at the time
what happens when you take president
trump out of the equation
and and biden no longer has this enemy
that everybody can
get behind as the same enemy if he loses
his common enemy
who is the enemy if you don't have an
enemy it's hard to keep your team
together right
at least trump had you know socialism as
his enemy
you know he had that so
biden will lose his enemy maybe what
happens if there's a terror attack in
this country
and it could be traced back to biden
reversing the ban on those countries
that don't have good record keeping so
you don't know
who is migrating immigrating what
happens
in four years four years is a long time
what are the odds there would be at
least
one domestic terror attack
because of that decision to let people
in from those countries that are a
little bit more risk
i don't know what the odds are but it
could happen what if he does something
with gun legislation
et cetera so you can imagine a whole
bunch of bad things happening if he
raises taxes
it's hard to imagine the economy doing
too well under that
situation so i've got a feeling that
you're going to see if biden takes the
job
it could be the beginning of a real bad
problem
for democrats because i think they would
lose the next presidency
if he if things go the way i think he
would lose presidency next time 2024
maybe lose the house
you know the senate might stay with the
republicans and you might have the
republicans in charge of
everything that really could happen
in 2024 so we'll see
why does it seem to me that when
democrats talk about
taxing the rich it doesn't sound like an
economic plan it sounds like punishment
for being successful doesn't it
now some people inherited so or got
lucky or whatever so
you know that seems different but
when i hear the democrats about talk
about taxing the rich
it just doesn't feel like it's because
it's a good idea
it feels like because it's revenge
right is it just me maybe it's because
it's personal
but it feels like it's personal it
doesn't even feel like they're
they're trying too hard to make it sound
like economics
that maybe it's just me
have you ever wondered why businesses
are still boarded up
i mean we have a president biden right
so
racism is over we we got a democrat in
control
shouldn't we be on boarding those
businesses
see the problem turns out that um
you know probably a new president won't
make any difference to those
riots or protests all right i'm going to
ask my uh
my friend dale to come in and to explain
to us
exactly how it is that this election
is not rigged um so you
if you've met dale before he's the
anti-trumper in some ways he looks like
me but he has a goatee
that's how you know he's not me and
so dale um if you could just come over
here i just have a quick question
um there have been a number of uh
allegations of fraud
in the elections um what do you think
about that
there has been no widespread
fraud in the election yeah i know
nobody's saying there's
widespread fraud the allegation is that
it's targeted
to just the places where it would make a
difference so do you think that happened
how many times do i need to tell you
there's not
any widespread fraud
okay i don't know what's happening here
um i'll try it again
nobody is making the allegation of
widespread
fraud so when you say there is none
we're in agreement on that
because nobody's saying that so but what
do you think about
the targeted fraud why do you think
there's widespread fraud
what the hell is happening here
do you not understand what what i'm even
talking about
i mean i i don't know what's happening
here
scott scott scott let me explain it to
you
in the past there have been recounts
many times in the past there have been
recounts those three counts
few hundred votes does not change the
outcome
scott scott scott you fool
[Laughter]
okay but dale the argument here
is not that this this year would be just
like
other years nobody's making that claim
the claim is that after four years of
this president being compared
to hitler that the incentive
this election was to get rid of them at
all costs
even at the cost of breaking the law
because that would be morally and
ethical
ethically supported
if you were really doing something to
get rid of hitler and that is exactly
what your fake news has told
democrats they were doing so under that
very specific situation
the claim is that it's not at all
comparable to
any prior year and that looking at prior
years
could only be misleading because they
don't have enough in common
with this very special election that had
a
weird situation with a president trump
who is compared to hitler for four years
so really it's only about this election
that the claim is being made
i don't think you understand scott there
have been recounts in the past
they they don't find anything a few
hundred votes
that's it what the hell is going on here
what the hell is going on are any of my
words that come out of my mouth
penetrating your skull we're in
agreement
no prior year is similar to this one
and scene so that's what you see on tv
is just a whole bunch of dales
pretending that you're in a different
argument and
what do you do with people who pretend
they're in a different argument
they're not even addressing anything
that's coming out of your mouth
and they they act like they are it's the
weirdest damn thing isn't it
all right um here are some things that
you would have to believe
in order to believe that there is
definitely
no no problems with the election
all right so you would have to believe
the following things
okay now i'm not if anybody is
joining late i do not make the claim
i do not make the claim that widespread
or even targeted fraud
has yet been demonstrated factually
in public i don't make that claim i do
make the claim
they haven't seen the good stuff yet now
whether that
makes a difference or not we'll see
but here's what you would have to
believe to believe that there's no
problem with the election that's big
enough
that could change things first of all
you'd have to wonder why there are no
data scientists on the democratic side
who are debunking the data scientists
who say hey i'm looking at this data
and it looks like there's a lot of
trouble here where are those people
so you first thing you have to ask
yourself is where are all our
data scientists because i can't tell if
dr
shiva has a good point but maybe
our top data scientists can
maybe they should weigh in where are
they
all right so that's the first thing
you're going to have to wonder is like
where are your experts
the other thing is when your news
reports
that they can't find any of this alleged
fraud where are they looking exactly
if if i tell you that i looked in my
pants pocket
for diamonds and i didn't find any have
i proven that diamonds don't exist
no not really i've only proven that
where i looked
i didn't find any and they're trying to
sell this to the idiots and the public
as if that means there are no problems
yeah if i look in the wrong place
no problem how about looking at the
right place
which would be an audit of let's say
this dominion software
when the new york times says there's no
evidence of fraud
does that mean that they have personally
audited the code
of dominion software or does it mean
that they looked in all the places where
there probably isn't any fraud
and then they didn't find any you have
to ask yourself
why are your sources of news
looking in the wrong places
so that would be a question why would
you think that this year
or this election would be anything like
prior elections in terms of the degree
of fraud
i think everybody agrees there's a
little bit of fraud all the time
but why would this year be comparable as
as dale is arguing it wouldn't be so if
you're thinking that the fraud of the
past and the recounts of the past
are indicative of what we're likely to
find this year
that's just batshit crazy if you think
that this is just like other years
you don't have a leg to stand on
uh biden's chief of staff this guy ron
claim
back in 2014 and of course
it doesn't take long for people to find
out what people have said in the past
uh he responded to a tweet by vox that
said they did a survey and found that 68
of americans think elections are rigged
this is 2014 right so in 2014
68 of americans thought elections are
rigged
what did biden's now selected chief of
staff
say on his tweet he said
because they are so biden's own chief of
staff
has said in public that he agrees with
the statement
that elections are rigged do you think
he got fixed
since 2014 do you think that somebody
who is
connected enough to politics to be
selected
as biden's chief of staff as president
do you think that such a person
is close enough and connected enough
with the
machinery of elections that when he says
in public
that elections are rigged do you think
he's guessing
probably not guessing probably not
um you would also have to believe if you
believe that there's definitely not any
widespread or significant fraud that
would change the election
you would have to believe that both rudy
giuliani and trump himself
uh have not seen better evidence than
you have so far seen
do you believe that do you believe
you've seen all the good stuff
because they're telling you you haven't
and would rudy go
that far out on a limb if he didn't
think he had the goods
let me ask you this who can sniff out
corruption
and fraud better than rudy giuliani
do you think there's anybody who has a
better nose for fraud
than rudy giuliani and if he were to be
doing this whole big effort
and it's based on nothing would he do it
and would he know he was doing it based
on nothing well i think he would know
if there's something there i feel he
would know
i feel the things we've seen so far
might be a stalling move
meaning that they're they're keeping the
the question of fraud alive with these
less credible accusations because it
just keeps the topic alive
then should they come in with better
information you have a live topic you
don't have to resurrect it
so i think what you're seeing is the
weaker claims
you know just sort of softening up the
room
they'll probably be debunked but the
strong stuff would come later
if it does all right so do you believe
that giuliani and trump
would do what they're doing now if they
hadn't seen better evidence
than you have seen so far
and then of course you'd have to believe
that the most corrupt institutions
in the country this time are telling you
the truth
they've never told you the truth before
but you would have to believe that this
time
this time they decided to tell the truth
so
it's not impossible it's definitely not
impossible
that the election will stand and will
stand because there wasn't enough fraud
to change anything totally possible but
if you think there's no chance
that this election was rigged at a
sufficient level to actually change it
if you think the answer to that is nah
zero
you're a idiot
sorry there's no way around that
if you think it could have happened or
you think it's unlikely
those are all reasonable opinions maybe
it happened
maybe it didn't pretty reasonable if you
think
that the absence of proof so far
is all you need to know about this being
a fair election
you're a idiot you're a
idiot
there's no way around that because we
don't know how this will turn out
that's the point nobody knows how it'll
turn out and if you think there couldn't
have been
enough fraud you're just a idiot
all right um
that's about all i need to say on this
i think i have said everything i need to
say
probably i think i have checking my
notes looking good
all right that's all i have for today
somebody said did you just insult my
ex-wife
perhaps i did you're welcome
somebody says the facts say i'm not an
idiot
which facts are those so basically 90
of the media no actually the media is
just lying
the the people in the professional
jobs you know the professional media
they know that
uh for this election could be fraudulent
i refuse to believe there's anybody on
cnn or msnbc
who's you know a high level person who's
been around the real world long enough
and
seen enough real news i don't think
there's anybody on cnn
who thinks it's impossible there are a
lot of people on cnn
who hope it's true that there wasn't
that much fraud
and there are plenty of people who know
it hasn't happened in the past or at
least
identified and there are plenty of
people who want you to believe
it's not true but no i don't believe
that the the jake tappers the don lemons
i do not believe they fall into the
category of idiots
the idiots would be the public who
believe what they're saying
the people who are saying things that
even they don't believe
are not idiots there's something else
going on right
they're persuading they're taking a team
side
maybe they think they're helping the
world but what is not happening is
stupidity
in their case but they are talking to
idiots and they are convincing idiots
so that's definitely happening all right
you seen a lot of trolls on this
broadcast i don't see too many
it's not as bad as it could be i would
say that the trolling
is way less this election not even
close the amount of paid trolls in 2016
was just crazy
the amount of trolls that came after me
this year
kind of trivial now i think some of it
is because
i learned how to block them better but i
think there just weren't as many
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow all right
periscope is turned off and youtube
still
on bitcoin is still going crazy
somebody says yeah i uh
i sold my bitcoin probably shouldn't
have done that
what electric bike do you have uh it's a
trek
trek i didn't do any shopping
because at the time they were in they're
really hard to get
so my local bike store has that brand
and had that model
and that's it i just got the one that
was available but it's very good
i i'm very happy with it
where is christina somebody says
christina
is probably right now getting ready to
go to flight school so she's trying to
get her
instrument rating she got her her pilot
license
yesterday she landed a uh
pits now there are
two percent of the people on this
periscope just heard that statement and
said
really holy cow so let me tell you why
that's impressive
uh planes are not alike
some are relatively easy to fly and easy
to land a cessna for example
would be a pretty easy plane a
a uh what they call a uh
a tail dragger or these these planes
that uh
are used for aerobatics tend to be
harder to land
because of the configuration of their
wheels and then within that world
of planes that are hard to land there's
one that's the hardest of all to land
it's the brand is pits p-i-t-t-s i
believe
and that's the one that if you can land
that plane
you can kind of land anything because
it's just so hard
and so christina accomplished that
yesterday so she landed about a dozen
times
all good and
yeah so there's somebody in the comments
who's saying impressive you're probably
a pilot
ask a pilot if they can land a pits
and then you'll be impressed so you'll
be impressed
as oppressed as i am yes she's a pilot
and she's hot as you say in the in the
comments you're right about both
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you
tomorrow
you
