good morning everybody and welcome to
another episode of the best thing that's
ever happened it's called
it's called coffee with scott adams and
the simultaneous sip and i was thinking
of doing something different this
morning
because
what normally when i do this i do it in
what i would call uh
let's say presentation mode
meaning that i know i'm talking to you
know a large group of people
and so i you know i modify my
presentation to make it a little bigger
for people and i thought what would
happen
if instead of that
i spoke to you
like we're just sitting in the same room
and it's just one of you
you want to try that today i want to see
if i can make you feel like it's just me
talking to you
now in order to do this experiment
sometimes you're going to have to talk
back
but since i can't hear you
i'll just act like i did
so i'll do my part and then i'll pause
for a moment while i listen to your part
and you can say anything you want at
home because i can't hear it
but despite not hearing it
watch how good my uh my communication
skills are
because without even hearing what you
say
i'm still going to respond to it yeah
that's how good my conversational skills
are
so
after the simultaneous sip
which i'm going to do in casual mode
we'll just talk
all right so so we'll just try this
today it's the only day we're going to
do that all right
hey how's it going you know you know
what would be great
have you ever done that simultaneously
you have
what do you mean you don't like it
you have to try it just try it
all right just pick up your cup
i know yeah i know you're skeptical i
know you're skeptical i was skeptical
too the first time i heard about it but
try the simultaneous sip you know
because all you need is a copper mug or
glass
you don't need much
tanker jealous
stein what are the other things uh
canteen jug flask whatever
so
let's see if it works go
was that a little too slurpy
it was
sorry
so have you seen the news today did you
have any time to look at the news
yourself
uh well luckily i did
so
anything happening with you
how was your morning
oh that's good
what are you doing today
you got
plans ah yeah one of those days
yeah
yeah i got plans too later
so uh did you hear about uh
did you hear about china
wow um
i don't know if this is working at all
probably not
but let's go back to presentation boat
so many of you asked me why it is that
i'm the only podcaster in the world
who can't solve
the audio problem
did you ever wonder that because you've
all seen me with massive audio and video
problems and you say to yourself
scott
joe rogan has solved this problem
why don't you just do what joe rogan
does or
how about any of the 10 million
podcasters who don't have any of these
problems
because let's explain it to you scott
there's you
here's you
and then there's 10
million podcasters
who seem to have solved the problem
that you alone
can't seem to solve do you see the
problem here
do you see the problem
well carpe thank you for saying the
audio is fine today
i don't think that was worth 20 but i
appreciate it
i mean it wasn't worth twenty dollars to
you
but i appreciate it
so here's here's what's different
nobody is solving my problem
right the problem that i have is
unsolved by any podcaster any anywhere
in the world
it's sort of an illusion do you know why
joe rogan can have good audio and i
can't
it's because it's not live
that's why
see what happens if he does it live
every day
it's going to be different
right
so if you do live
you can't do what all the other
podcasters do which is make sure it
works before you go now one of the
things that you don't know
if you've not been a guest on many
podcasts as i have been
is that even the recorded podcasts
they usually have to tweak the audio and
try it again and test and move things
around and you know it even recorded
once it's hard
then the other thing is suppose i did it
live
but i had a an engineer
who was working with me to make sure
that everything's working as it happens
so i don't have to worry about that
there's an engineer sitting there
i can't do the show with an engineer
do you get that
how many of you understand that before i
explain it
that if i had an engineer
working with me i couldn't do this
this none of this would be possible if
anybody else is sitting in the room
because anybody else in the room is
going to be sucking my energy out before
i go live
you can't have other people in the room
if you're going to be live right
now if you're joe rogan it's a whole
operation right you've got you got your
engineer your guest you know it's like a
party
if it's a party
that works pretty well right you got
more than one person you're you know
it's a whole thing but the last thing i
would want is to wake up at four in the
morning
and have my engineer sitting here
can you imagine that
it would just be the worst
setup in the world right the fact that i
do this alone is why i like it
everything about
the thing that i like i couldn't do with
an engineer alright that's enough about
that
i have revised my opinion on general
milly since yesterday
you ready for this
i believe and i've said this before
that everyone deserves a defense
would you agree with the the following
statement everyone deserves a defense
even if they're guilty
in our country now in the legal system
of course they get one
but what about in the public realm
suppose you were you're
suppose you're being attacked in the
public realm
do you deserve a defense well of course
you can make one
you can just go in public and say here's
my defense
but what if you can't
and i'm not sure general milley can in
this situation
because there are a lot of minefield
you know a lot of minds in the minefield
i'm not sure he can defend himself
and so
as a courtesy
to the military
because he is a he's a military person
and we respect the military and i
believe that as a member of the military
that it is my responsibility as a
citizen
to support them as they support me and
support you so i'm going to support him
now
i don't know if he's innocent or guilty
competent or incompetent i'm just going
to give him a defense
is that fair before you even hear it
i just want to ask you is that fair
to give him a defense
wouldn't you want to hear one
if he's still guilty after you hear the
defense
that's fine but everybody deserves a
defense especially a military person
who here thinks a military professional
doesn't deserve a defense
right nobody
all right here's the defense
shoe on the other foot test number one
this is the alan dershowitz test
if
tr um if biden
had been the president
when millie talked to china and said hey
don't worry
you know i got this you don't have to
worry
would i be
as angry at him
or would i say to myself you know
you
know biden might be a little mentally
degraded
i kind of feel a little safer
knowing that there's an adult who will
say no i'm not going to push that
nuclear button
i need to ask some questions
so so that's that's the first part of
the defense is would you feel exactly
the same
if millie was the check against biden's
brain
because he was acting as the check
against trump's brain
now i think he was incorrect in
estimating his risk
if he if in fact because we don't know
this as a fact but if he thought it was
a real risk
and i'm not sure he did i think i think
you have to be skeptical of the
reporting but if he thought it was true
that there was some risk
wouldn't you want him to act
now some people say oh that's the wrong
way it's the wrong mechanism should have
gone through the 25th amendment to talk
to congress talk to the vice president
there's a whole different thing you
don't want to violate the chain of
command hold on hold on
separate question
did i defend
his going around the chain of command
no no i'm not going to defend that
i'm not going to defend
the question of whether he should be
fired
because he should
i still think he should be fired because
he went around the chain of command and
unfortunately that's it just has to be
there's just no way around that
right the moment you allow
that you can make an exception to the
chain of command you're done you're done
right you can't make it an exception
he has to be fired in my opinion based
on what we know but you know
if we're being honest and humble about
this we don't know everything it could
be that the story is not anything like
we think
but here's the defense i'm going to give
him
are you ready for this
here's the defense
although i believe he needs to be fired
for violating the chain of command
if he was acting responsibly
it probably looked like this
imagine if you believed that china was
worried
do you think they were
do you think that china's military
was getting antsy
now the question is was china simply
sitting there not worried at all
and they didn't even think about it
until millie called them do you think
that's the case
or do you think that millie already knew
china was concerned about some kind of
sudden military action because trump was
unstable according to our own our own
media
i think
china's military was concerned what do
you think let's let's test your
assumptions test your assumption we
don't know
but do you think china's military
was at least concerned enough to ask
some questions
not not really worried necessarily that
it'd be a war
but worried enough
just to ask the question
what do you think
a lot of no's a lot of people say no
but you don't think that they would at
least ask if there was any risk because
you just have to ask right
just ask your counterpart is there any
risk here
is there something we need to be worried
about here
now a lot of you are saying no but would
you agree that that's an assumption
of you saying no
that's an assumption right you don't
know
i'm going to make the assumption that
and because remember i'm i'm giving
milli a defense doesn't doesn't matter
that i believe in it or that it's true
i'm simply giving him a defense that
everybody deserves because for whatever
reason he's not doing it himself
and maybe he just can't speak of it
without getting in more trouble
if the only thing milly did
was talk to nervous chinese counterparts
and tell them
there's no real risk here
what's the problem go
all right so just take this as an
assumption not a fact it's sort of a
mental experiment
if the only thing he did
was reassure them that it doesn't look
like there's any risk
is that good or bad
because was there a risk
was there any risk that trump was going
to attack china
no right
no there was no risk
if china thought there was a risk was it
good or bad
that he told them don't worry about this
there's no risk here and even if you
thought there was a risk with trump
he'd have to get through me first and
it's not going to happen
right chain of command now everybody
who's saying chain of command
we're all on the same page milly needs
to be fired
for violating it
right
i think he does
but that doesn't mean he did the wrong
thing
there can be times when you do the wrong
the right thing and still have to be
fired
does everybody agree
there could be times when a military
person does the right thing
but still has to be fired
this might be one of those cases
millie
might have simply been telling a
dangerous uh
you know dangerous country
that there's nothing to be worried about
because there wasn't
now
the i think the hypothetical that you're
holding in your head
is that maybe we were going to attack
right because if we were actually
thinking of attacking china
then that would be treason
does everybody agree with that that if
it was on the table
if we'd even been thinking about it a
little bit
attacking china
if it was even a little bit of a thought
then talking to china about it would
certainly be treason
you'd all agree with that right
that's obvious
but suppose
and he wouldn't know for sure
suppose there was no chance
there was no chance at all
there was no plan no chance no no remote
chance at all
is it treason to tell somebody who could
act dangerously if they don't know
that there is no uncertainty here
there's no uncertainty
there's no danger
you're definitely not going to get
attacked by us
and believe me i can assure you that
because i can stop it personally
somebody says it's treason
make the argument for treason
what is the argument for keeping the
united states safer
how's that treasonous
when there was no risk of danger other
than you know people's minds imagining
there was a risk
why would they believe him well that
doesn't matter
that's
not relevant to the question
um if china attacked what you think
china was going to attack
who thinks china was going to attack
we are so far
from a shooting war with china
we're a million miles away from that
because neither side wants it for any
reason whatsoever there is no scenario
in which either the united states or
china wants to shoot a bullet
right
we don't want to do that
um china has been attacking yet in the
cyber way et cetera but and of course
i'm sure we're responding on that
all right so that's my defense of
general milly
and i
um again if you're just joining me it's
not that i know he's um
that i know he did something right i'm
not saying that i'm saying that there's
enough ambiguity in this story that you
cannot assume
it was treasonous by its nature
we don't have enough information for
that
if the only thing that was going wrong
was that china had some questions
and he was just making sure that
something that wasn't going to happen
was well understood
and it made us safer
which it would have
yeah right reassuring china that we're
not going to attack any moment does make
the united states safer
so if general milley made us safer or
even was attempting to make us safer
and it cost him his job
well maybe that's the way it has to go
but you know they sign up to die
right
you join the military to give your life
potentially for the country
if what millie did was risk his job and
reputation for the country
he's a military man
and i would respect that if that's what
happened even if he has to be fired for
violating the chain of command
all right that's my argument
um apparently there was a research
funded by some big tech company or
companies that found that 32 percent of
teen girls
who felt bad about their bodies
said instagram made the issue worse
now
32 percent of girls
said that
but that's probably also how many girls
use instagram
because i don't know any
uh teenage girls who don't feel bad
about their bodies
pretty much they all feel bad about
their bodies
because that's what social media has
done
but but 32 of them are literally being
uh psychologically harmed by instagram
how do we let this happen
how do you let in teenage boys too but i
i have to think it's way worse for girls
because instagram really is a showcase
of
female
sex appeal
it's not so much male sex appeal but i
know what you mean
um
here's a question to you do you have you
know anybody who's dating age
so this is this is not for you who are
of a certain age but rather do you know
somebody who's a teenager or in their
20s and they're dating and i have this
question for you
i've been hearing this from anecdotally
from a number of different sources
that boys aren't as interested in girls
as they used to be
are you hearing that
and specifically
um
even physically
i um yeah i'm seeing all yes's in the uh
in the comments on locals it's a little
faster than than on youtube yeah i'm
saying all yeses
oh my god i didn't think i'd see this
much agreement
you know what i expected i expected you
to say i hadn't noticed it
oh my god almost every person noticed it
holy holy holy
cow are you seeing this if you're just
listening to this i'm being blown away
right now
on both youtube and locals
it looks like a hundred percent of the
comments just flowing past
or are saying yes
they've noticed that the boys are less
interested in girls
now people are saying it's the low
testosterone
might be political correctness or well
not political correctness that's the
wrong word it might be more sensitivity
to me too stuff could be the boys are
less aggressive because they've been you
know trained to be less aggressive
in a good way i mean it doesn't mean
that's a bad way
if they're obeying the law i suppose
that's a good way
um
yeah
now why do you think that is
i have two hypotheses
three i'm making just came up with the
third one
number one low testosterone that's the
obvious one and we know i believe we
know that to be true is there anybody
who thinks that's not true is that
possibly fake news
it's confirmed right i hope i'm not
spreading some fake science but i think
it's confirmed that testosterone is much
lower than it used to be
in the average public
somebody's saying this because of soy i
don't know if that's why but maybe
the other thing is
porn
women and girls didn't used to have
competition
if you were a heterosexual
that's all you had when i grew up we
didn't even have porn
and we had it but we didn't have much
access to it
so
if everything i know about economics
and competition and humanity is true
then as porn got better
the extra value of a living human being
that you know the difference was
decreasing
and as i've said before porn has gotten
to the point thanks to technology where
you can get exactly what you want
and the difference between
seeing you know general porn that you
know everybody responds to a little bit
versus that exact thing that really gets
you going maybe not everybody else but
it gets you going
you can get that exact thing
and that closes the difference between a
living human
and the experience you can get from your
computer
and it is continuing to close it's you
know every day
it's closing more what happens when you
get full uh
3d
what happens
when you have full 3d
and you can actually just put yourself
at the scene
well
why would you date
if you've got an ai girlfriend that you
can visit anytime you want just putting
on your goggles
two-thirds of men are just going to give
up on women
because
i'm just going to say this
all right
i i think my audience can handle this
are you ready
women and girls
are a much
worse deal than they used to be not just
because of the competition of porn
but because i think society has caused
us
to sort of become enemies
you know the the genders
and um i'm open to the argument that it
used to be better for men and worse for
women and all that's happening is things
are rebalancing and things are better
for women
at the expense of you know whatever
badness men were getting away with
so i mean maybe it's a good thing but
the net effect of it is that women are
less valuable
to men
because they're more of a pain in the
ass
let me just say it directly
women are less valuable to men in 2021
than they used to be because women are
more of a pain in the ass
every man knows what i'm talking about
right you all know what i'm talking
about now
does that mean
that that's a bad change i'm not saying
that i'm not saying at all because
sometimes being a pain in the ass is a
good thing
it means you're getting what you want it
means you're asserting yourself
it means you're not you know you're not
being walked all over etc so i'm not
sure i would advise a daughter
to be any different than that you know
stand up for yourself
go go get what's right for you
but the net effect of that
is that it makes women a pain in the ass
and less valuable as a
as something you want to associate with
so there's a lot of bad stuff happening
right now in terms of gender relations
keep an eye on that meanwhile over in
china
wall street journal did a piece on
how tick tock is reprogramming your
brain
and apparently the main part of tick
tock's algorithm and this is no surprise
yeah you assume that this is true of
instagram and everything else
but apparently the main part of the
algorithm is how long you watch anything
so if you spend a lot of time looking at
a certain kind of content
tick doc knows it and they
give you more of that content
now
what does china need to brainwash our
children
just this
because china has owns basically tick
tock
meaning that it's a chinese company
and the chinese government of course has
access to any chinese company's
technology or backdoor
nobody doubts that
so the chinese government
has a tool
that can brainwash every child in
america who uses tick tock which is most
of them at this point
and the way they can do it is simply
finding out what they watch naturally
and that tells you what they respond to
and once you know what somebody responds
to
you have everything you need
have you ever trained a dog
it's easy you just give them a treat
when they do something similar to what
you want them to do
until it gets closer and closer to the
behavior you want
and then you lock it in by giving a
treat every time you get the behavior
tick tock
can give you treats now
it can train you like a dog
really
not that's not hyperbole
tick tock can train you like a dog
because it knows which
treats are treats to you
it knows how to how to light that up
light up that part of your brain
for just you
remember what i said about
porn is
turbocharged because they can
they can adapt it just to the specific
individual
well so can tick-tock
tick-tock can give you a treat in the
form of exactly the content you were
looking for that makes you happy
any time it wants
and if it can control when you get a
treat
and when you don't
it owns you
whoever controls the treats
in charge
now will they weaponize it will they
take advantage of this opening that they
have to
to change the brains of american
children
of course
of course suppose you saw some content
that china thought was going to be
really bad for america let's say it's
something some meme or some belief
that kids were spreading around
and you knew it was going to be
destructive to the fiber of american
life
how could you make
more of that go around
well
all you could do is sandwich it between
two treats
you just serve up a treat that's exactly
what you wanted to see oh i love that
then you serve up the little part that's
the brainwashing manipulation
and then you serve up another treat
and you just sandwich it
what will people think of that little
nugget that's between the two treats
where dogs
we're gonna like that thing better
because it was sandwiched between two
treats
and the treats made us happy and then we
were happy when we saw the content and
the happiness rubbed off on us that's
how it works
you associate things and you take the
goodness or the badness of a thing and
you transfer it to another thing
that's brainwashing
that's what tick tock can do
natively
it's built for that
okay
so
why is tick tock legal in the united
states
anybody
why why is tick tock still operating in
the united states
can anybody answer that question
why is tick tock still operating because
remember
trump took a run at it but for whatever
reason didn't didn't shut it down
greed i don't know i don't think there's
any profit motive because it's a chinese
company no i don't think they're bribing
anybody i'd be really surprised
if it's a bribe
somebody says china owns biden well i
don't know i doubt it matters on this
issue necessarily
here's my opinion
they don't understand the the issue
i believe that joe biden does not
understand the risk of tick tock
did you did you understand the risk
until i explained it to you
let me ask in the comments until you
heard it from me
did you understand the risk
all right looking at the comments
uh seeing lots of yeses but lots of no's
now of course my audience you know
you've been sort of maybe trained to it
so see the difference well you can't see
the difference so i'll just tell you on
you on youtube where i get more more
people who are new to me
i think there are a few more no's than
there are on
on locals where people have been
following me for a while
yeah so here's my
my belief i don't think biden knows it's
dangerous
or and nobody's probably taken it to him
and explained it in the way that i'm
explaining it
so i think it's probably an incompetence
problem
meaning that there's there's a level of
ignorance about the risk
and hasn't been communicated to the
people who can make the decisions what
else is cia doing
now maybe maybe the cia you know got in
it too and
maybe they've got some secret plan to
use it to spy on china or something i
guess it could be some reason that i
don't know about
but it doesn't look like competence to
me
according to a tweet i saw by saul of
united on twitter
china is responsible for more than
two-thirds of state-sponsored cyber
attacks around the world
two-thirds of them
and apparently the new technique is that
states like russia or china
will use criminal organizations to do
the hacking
so if anybody gets caught the government
can say well it wasn't us
we're sorry that our criminal
organizations did that to you and we'll
arrest them as soon as we can we'll get
right on that
so suppose that's the situation and
they've got this deniability because
they're using these criminal
organizations to do their hacking
what would you do about it
well i don't know what we are doing
about it but i'll tell you what i would
do about it i would pay
russian hackers to hack china
right
if our cia is not
hiring russian hackers
criminals
to hack china
why not
why not
how about north korean hackers
i don't know if you could hire them
that'd be harder but i hear they're
pretty good too
are you telling me we're not hiring any
criminal organizations to hack china
and if china's doing two-thirds of the
hacking
we've got some catching up to do
because i'm sure we have enough money to
hire enough criminal organizations
to you know
get up to two-thirds of the hacking
ourselves we should be hacking the
 out of china
with illegal um illegal hackers
in fact their entire network should be
crashing right now
from illegal criminal gangs hacking
their network in fact there should be so
many hacks their lights should go out
and then we should say
i don't know what you're talking about
oh oh you mean what the criminal hackers
are independently doing
well we don't know about that
i mean it's a shame that all those
russian criminal gangs are hacking you
china
it's a shame
what can we do about it
nothing we can do about it oh and by the
way
that trucker full of fentanyl we shipped
over to wuhan
good luck with that we should also be
shipping them deadly uh fentanyl and
putting it in their water supply
just kidding just kidding we don't want
to do mass murder
well
yeah we don't want to do that
well i think that the funniest story in
the world still two days running is
nicki minaj's cousin's friend with his
swollen balls allegedly because he got a
vaccination turns out that the
government of trinidad spent the entire
day yesterday
researching
wait for it
let me back up again because i want to
make sure that you're all ready for it
when i when i get to the
conclusion
the government of trinidad
the government the government of
trinidad
spent all day yesterday
researching
nicki minaj's cousins friends swollen
balls
and found out
it didn't happen
or at least they can't find it
so according to them
there was no nicki minaj cousin's friend
with swollen balls
i don't know where that came from
but
i don't think there's anything better
or more entertaining than the government
of an entire island nation
spending their whole day
researching somebody's balls
now
i've been accused a little bit of
you know being sometimes narcissistic
i can't believe that anybody would say
that about me seems so cruel and wrong
but when i heard this story
i thought to myself
why not me
nobody's talking about my balls
it's like we're all about oh nicki
minaj's cousin's balls
like he's so special
like his balls are
just they're special because they're
what swollen
my balls could be swollen that's no big
accomplishment
why are we talking about my balls
why are his balls so special that the
entire country of trinidad cares about
it nay
america cares about his bowls does
anybody care about yours well those of
you who possess them
no
nobody cares about our bowls
let me tell you the funniest
act that i ever the funniest thing i've
ever seen on the stage comedian it was
george carlin live
so a number of years ago
i attended a george carlin outdoor live
you know stand-up comedy event and it
was you know near near my home not too
far down the road
bicycle distance in fact i've bicycled
to that location before
so it's a
bicycle distance i'm sitting there and
i'm listening to
george carlin
and
he gets introduced and he starts talking
before you even see him
right so imagine the empty stage he's
been introduced by the you know the
the host
and then as you see this figure walking
toward the stage he's already talking in
his microphone
now
the background you have to know is that
lance armstrong was in the news a lot
and that lance armstrong at that time
and that lance armstrong famously has
one testicle
right
and he had cancer apparently
and
george carlin is walking onto stage
and with no context this is what makes
it funny there's no lead in no trigger
for this no context this is the first
thing he says
he goes
 like he goes lance armstrong
and as he's walking to the stage he goes
 is cancer and i'm starting to laugh
and by the time he hits the stage he
goes his balls
and i'm dead
i'm just dead
from that moment on
i was uncontrollably laughing and never
stopped
now why is that funny
i don't exactly know
like i've spent i can't tell you how
much time i've spent thinking about it
but
um it's not it's not something that
sounds so funny if you wrote it down
it's a it's a live act kind of a joke
and it only works in person
i guess because it's naughty i guess
because it's so irreverent i guess it's
unexpected
i guess
i don't know i guess it's like five
different things in there it's a whole
layer of complicated thing
but
um until until this week
lance armstrong had the most famous
bowls
or ball
at least he was halfway there
and uh
um it's not true that he would lance
armstrong was ever asked to uh
to do a commercial for uniball pens
uh i've heard that but that's that's not
true
all right
you know the publication the hill
you've all heard of that the hill
today
they have an article today
in which they repeated the fine people
hoax like it was real
today
now i understand back in i don't know
was it 2018 or whenever whenever the
charlottesville thing happened i
understand that a lot of people were
taken by the media hoax at the time
and they believed that trump had
actually called neo-nazis fine people
now anybody who seen the transcript
knows that didn't happen there was a
selective edit
that made it look like that and the part
they cut out is the part where he goes
and i'm paraphrasing uh don't you know
don't be confused i'm certainly not
calling the neo-nazis fighting people
i don't mean them
right so they just cut out the part
where he says no i don't mean the
neo-nazis he wasn't even asked about it
he said that himself because he wanted
to make sure
that nobody would be confused that he
certainly wasn't talking about neo-nazis
being fined people so they just added
that part out it looks exactly like he's
calling them fine people
so the hill
somehow in 2021 a news organization
doesn't know that
they still today they reported it like
it's true it was you know in a larger
article but reported this like it's true
what the hell
what the hell
i mean
and and i know you know from experience
that lots of people will see the tweet
in which i called the mount for that and
lots of people are gonna say well i saw
i saw it myself
yeah we don't have to reiterate this but
you know they didn't see it themselves
it is literally a mass hallucination
it's the best one i've ever seen by the
way i don't know if you could come up
with a better one
i think the fine people hoax is the
biggest i don't know if it's the biggest
but probably the best example of a mass
hallucination you'll ever see lots of
people believe they saw it like their
memory is that it actually happened but
never did
all right
north korea has tested a missile that
they launched from a train
um i'm not really afraid of
train missiles
because i don't think they're the ones
that are going to be aimed at the united
states i don't think you i don't think
you
uh launch a missile from a train at the
united states because it seems like that
wouldn't be the right launch pad
secondly what happens to your train
after you launch a missile from it
is there anything left to your train
i can't think of a worse way to launch a
missile can you
i feel as though if i had to pick any
way to launch a missile
putting it on a train would be the worst
way i mean i realize the train stops
before they launch the missile but isn't
it going to mess up your trade a little
bit
how do you get your train home
are the tracks okay you're gonna run
your passenger train over the i mean how
does that work
so anyway i would uh say again that i
think trump has solved north korea in
the sense that north korea doesn't seem
to be pointing any missiles at us
whatever they're doing maybe it's for
commercial reasons they want to sell
some missiles that's bad but they're not
pointing them directly at us and i think
i just don't think trump gets enough
credit for having solved north korea
when was the last time you worried about
north korea even when they test missiles
are you worried
no no you're not
because
we they're just not enemies
trump
i you know i'm just blown away by this
what trump did in north korea
is probably the greatest persuasion
we've ever seen in public
i don't know that there's ever been
anything more impressive than that
see what problems i got here now
no okay
um and what was impressive about it is
that the only problem between north
korea and the united states was that we
imagined we had a problem and if you
could stop imagining that your enemies
then you just stop acting that way and
so what
and so what trump did was simply
convince kim
that there wasn't any reason to be
enemies
that's it
uh and it was brilliant and apparently
it's lasting because years later
i mean several years later and they
don't seem to be any kind of a risk
we're barely even talking about them
question whatever happened to the coven
sniffing dogs
covet sniffing dogs
we were told maybe a year ago the dogs
dogs could detect covet
and
if we had dogs that were trained to
detect covet
could they not
check everybody going into a sporting
event and pull out the infected ones
probably
and how many dogs would it take
i mean by now it's a year later have we
not really trained enough dogs i'd love
to have an update on that
and and wouldn't you love dogs save
america
because they could
apparently if it's true that they can
they can sniff it out
then it should be true that they can
save america
and why don't we have like what is it
the um
the war production act or something it's
the one where we produce more stuff
president makes companies private
companies produce more stuff because
it's a war setting
could we not use the production act
war production act to train more dogs
and just have ton of trading dogs
everywhere just everywhere you go
there's a dog
why not
do we run out of dogs
do you have to have a special dog is it
that hard to train them
i know i'd just like an update on that
it could be that it just takes so long
to train them
you can't get there i don't know
here's a perspective from the panda
tribune you'll have to do a fact check
on this i don't know if this is
factually correct but it's interesting
so the panda tribune says statistically
speaking school children are far more
likely to be sexually assaulted by their
teachers
than they are to die from covet 19.
number one
is that true
is that true
they're more likely to be sexually
assaulted by their teacher than to die
of cover 19.
i think it might be
i think that might be true
right
and if it is true
does that tell you that the kids are
wearing their masks on the wrong part of
their body
i'll just let that sit there for a
minute
i'm just saying letting us sit there
that's all just enjoy it
okay now we can move on
my next question is how do we know that
the delta variant of the covid is really
a variant and not a separate
virus created
for the same bad reason
how do we know that
what are the odds
that we would have a zillion variants
and only one bad one the delta
now we hear rumors that there might be
the mew and some other greek letters
coming that could be bad
but not yet
what are the odds just statistically
that you'd have exactly
one
delta variant the kind that's super bad
just one
now i could see zero
and i could see 25.
like those would make sense to me right
just
just how you you imagine statistical
likelihood
zero makes sense
because it's just unlikely
25 makes sense 100 makes sense a
thousand would make sense
but one
exactly one
i'm not buying it
it's sketchy
right i would love to hear an expert
tell me
what are the odds you get exactly one
now i get that some of the other ones
are a little bit worse and you know the
other variants and stuff and we're
watching them and blah blah blah
but just what
i don't know not buying it
could be but i'm not buying it yet i
could be convinced
all right uh you've been hearing for a
year and a half michael mina has been
talking about the why we should have
rapid tests now we're doing a little
more biden authorized some money for
rapid tests and that's very good
but i think some publication needs to do
a pulitzer prize winning report
on why we don't already have rapid tests
let me tell you the situation
so the fda gets to approve what tests
are in the market
they have very strict requirements
because medical things need to be tested
to be safe so they have to medically
medically certified right
but as michael mina points out
that is probably stopping us from
making a big dent in the pandemic
because the rapid tests which would be a
little harder to get medically certified
because it's a higher standard are super
useful
if we had them
but we don't have many of them because
apparently something's holding up the
approvals
now
what is it that would hold up the
approvals of the one thing that we could
pretty much say for sure
would solve the pandemic
did you hear what i just said
that we have something already a known
thing
that we know how to make more of them we
know how to do it
and we know
that it would solve largely solve the
pandemic
and it's not happening
all i would take is an executive order
from biden this is michael mina's idea
to simply redefine the rapid tests
as being a uh
was it a
public health product as opposed to a
medical product i may have the words
wrong but that's the idea
so all he has to do that's it
all biden has to do
one piece of paper
to say oh if it's a rapid test and
define what that means if it's a rapid
test it's not a
a medical device
it's a it's a public health device
that change alone gets the fda out of it
opens up the market so the market can do
what the market does
tons of rapid tests everybody tests
96 of the time you find that you're
um that you're a spreader
a few times you don't but you weren't
going to find that anyway
so you're you're 96 percent better than
you would have been if you have the test
and it's probably enough to squash the
virus
it's probably enough
to get us back to normal
all it would take is one signature on
one piece of paper and there's
hold on
there's no argument against it
show me another
another important topic in the united
states
where there's no argument against it
well nuclear power
nuclear energy became that right yeah i
mean at least in public people are no
longer willing to say bad things about
it because science has you know
made that ridiculous
but think about it there's got to be
some corruption going on here
or massive incompetence or something
going on but one piece of paper
and biden could
eradicate the pandemic
yeah there's something going on here and
we need to know
uh rasmussen asked how concerned are you
about crowds attending football games in
terms of getting covered and as you
might imagine 34 said they're very
concerned and 25 said somewhat so 59
percent
are concerned
about covid and football games
but
if they all took a rapid test before
they went in or they all had a dog
sniffing them
would they be so worried
no so there are things we can do that
we're not doing and we don't know why
incompetence and or
corruption it's got to be the answer
so this is uh
this is uh michael mina's letter to
biden he put it on
on twitter
he said uh dear
president of the united states biden the
u.s is at a critical point and need
greater access to faster tests rapid
tests are barely available because
they're regulated here as medical tools
and hold which holds it back please
write an eo that makes cova testing in
us a public health good as opposed to a
medical good and then that will free up
the market
one piece of paper
one signature
one of the biggest improvements in
in the pandemic
now
the same idea
was pushed and pushed and pushed during
the
trump administration and didn't happen
i heard some reports that maybe some
bureaucratic
stuff stopped it from being explained in
a way that the administration could even
know how to deal with it but i think
michael mena has now simplified it to
the point where it's just one piece of
paper one signature if biden gets this
done
i will say publicly that biden has done
a great thing that that the trump
administration failed on
and i will say that plainly
if biden signs the ceo
or even knows about it i don't even know
if he's heard about it but if he signs
it
i'm going to say unambiguously that
biden gets the win and and trump has to
explain why he didn't do it i mean he'd
have some explaining to do
so
that's as open-minded as i can be on
politics
um somebody says dog sense illnesses not
viruses
yeah i guess that's true but it means
that the virus had taken hold enough to
give you an illness
um
all right that's all i got for now
and uh i'm sure this was the best live
stream i've ever done
just like the last one
and
that's all
i've the sound is not not good oh good
all right i'll talk to you
tomorrow
