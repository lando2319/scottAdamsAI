[Music]
hey Peter come on in
here I'm sure that like Peter you have
your beverage ready Peter I see you
picking up your beverage container right
now those of you who are not as quick as
Peter such as Paulie and Jackie and
Arlene I see you coming in here grab
your cups your mugs your chalice your
Steins your tankers perhaps your thermos
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
simultaneous
sip
oo extra extra good today
extra so you may have noticed that the
news has already gone into summer reruns
a little early this year I was expecting
the summer reruns to start closer to
may you know what I'm talking about
there there's no good news coming out so
the the news has started to recycle
scandals from the past do you remember
that time the president Trump made the
hand motions that seem to be
mocking a man with a physical
disability no I don't remember that I do
remember president Trump being blamed
for that
and unlike half of the country who is
trapped in a news Silo I saw the
compilation Clips showing that he uses
that same motion making fun of a lot of
different people including Ted
Cruz in fact I would like to
suggest the Ted Cruz rule are you ready
for
it if the
president uses a particular insult or
attack against Ted
Cruz you cannot say that he is using it
because he's a ra that the president is
racist and you can't say that he's
making fun of handicapped people because
also the president questioned Ted
Cruz's uh birth
certificate not technically but he he
questioned whether Ted Cruz was born in
the United States and eligible to run
for for
president so the president has uh blamed
Ted Cruz he's he's mocked Ted Cruz
exactly the same way he mocked a person
with a bad arm and he's questioned Ted
Cruz's citizenship and eligibility for
president the same as he criticized
president uh
Obama so it's the Ted Cruz rule if he's
ever done it to Ted Cruz it doesn't
count um the other rerun we're getting
is the animals comment taking in a
context we're getting the fine people
hoax over and over again the fine people
hoax is coming out the idea that the
idea that the president never uh spoke
out against white
supremacists um we're getting oh we're
getting the Steve Miller attacks we've
never seen those before have we oh Steve
Miller that Jewish white
supremacist how does that even work
how can you even be a Jewish white
supremacist isn't that like
opposites so the criticisms have become
sort of hollow reruns of past criticisms
that have already been
debunked that's all they have it's
really a good time to be alive because
you look at the the problems in the
world and and you just say uh that's it
the biggest problem in the world is a
rerun of a
hoax that everybody well not everybody
half of the country knows it's a
hoax on CNN last night the columnist
Matt
Lewis uh is saying that the Democrats
are quote too woke they're over
woke the Democrats are realizing that
they're over woke they're so woke that
they might not be able to be beat
president
Trump now not only are they over woke
but today the CNN is taking a run at um
knocking kamla Harris on of the news now
they could be trying to inoculate her by
getting her bad news out of the way but
it doesn't look like that it looks like
they may have soured on Harris why you
ask would would CNN be seemingly This Is
Us just just interpreting it from the
outside doesn't mean we're right but the
way it looks from the outside is that
cenan was initially very Pro haris but
now that she is fourth in the poles they
may have soured a little bit because the
problem with what what is the big
problem with Kam
Harris can somebody tell me the big
problem with Kam Harris as a
candidate
boring boring
she's very boring she's had quite a few
months here to make some news and she
doesn't know how to do it apparently
she's boring and you would never have
imagined that boring would be would be
such a uh a problem doesn't it seem to
you that boring didn't used to be a
problem nobody really said hey that
Romney he can't work because he's boring
not really I mean people said that but
they they said he was boring but I don't
think anybody said there's no way you
can win the presidency with your boring
personality
although um I thought Romney was
interesting and funny when he was
talking about the effort by the
Democrats to get Trump's tax returns and
he called it
moronic with a big smile that he showed
some personality there I I thought that
was funny
um so it could be the
CNN because CNN remember CNN is mostly
like any other public company they're
mostly involved with their own
profitability would and so here's the
interesting question would CNN make more
money if their candidate
one in other words if a Democrat beat
Trump would they make more money in the
future or
less think about it or like along the
same lines would CNN as a business make
more money in the future by running a
boring candidate against President Trump
which which situation feeds their
business model the most I don't know it
looks like running the interesting
candidate who could also win would be
you know in their best
uh their best interests but I think on
some level they may not want to
win let me ask you this would CNN have
more stories that are interesting or
fewer stories that are interesting if
president Trump is no longer president
they might actually be panicked that
their side could win there might be and
this is no joke so what I'm going to say
is not high
just
speculation CNN might get to the point
where their their financial interest is
exactly counter to their political
preferences if we get to the point where
let's say it looks like kamla Harris
could
win what would that do to CNN's ratings
if she actually
won who would watch CNN again for the
rest of lives what would be the point
people watch CNN to watch them bash
Trump watch watching CNN bash kamla
Harris that's not fun there's nothing
fun about
that
so we may be in this weird situation
where CNN needs to take out their own
side for financial
reasons now I don't believe
that there will ever be like a
conversation like that where anybody of
CNN and management says anything like
that right so I'm not saying that
anybody in CNN will ever say hey maybe
we should put our thumb on the scale and
let Trump win again because it's good
for our
ratings but they're all going to think
it they're there's nobody in CNN who
won't think it excuse
me I don't know my nose runs only when I
talk on Periscope it's a weird
thing so we may see a situation where
CNN becomes the inadvertent Ally of
trump just to give him a second term
it's
possible uh you can't rule that now
anymore all right
um so one of the big stories we're going
to hear as we talk more and more about
immigration is about the administration
putting kids in Obama cages you know
about the Obama cages right oh oh you
didn't know they were obam cages of
course most of you do do know that but I
was testing out the idea
of for a long time people have saying
yes Trump did put children in cages but
Obama did it too and you've notice that
absolutely nobody cares about that
argument have you noticed that it's a
true AR
argument that can be verified the the
facts are all clear Obama did it at a
lower level situation changed so that
more people were coming because of the
rules that allowed amnesty Etc and and
Trump had more of
it but did Trump build the cages I ask
you did Trump build those
cages maybe maybe some of them are
new my gu is that they are literally
obam
cages so rather than saying Obama did it
too maybe we should just say yeah it is
true that the administration put kids in
obam cages so let's call them obam cages
because that's catchier than saying well
Obama did it too because the the
whataboutism just always falls on
empty well empty ears now that doesn't
make sense
the when you say the other side did it
too nobody can hear that it's such an
empty charge that everybody knows it's
true they just don't care so I would say
rather than say rather than trying to
defend what Trump did I wouldn't I
wouldn't try to defend it because you
just can't there's just no defense for
it that that feels good there there's
plenty of defense for it in terms of
explaining the situation and it's
unfortunate but we you know it really
kept them safe nobody can even hear that
stuff it's
like just noise they hear cages kids and
and that's pretty much they're they're
done with the thinking so let's let's
talk more about the Obama cages that's
what they should just be called if Obama
built them and Obama put them into
action and Trump just continued using
them just call them obam cages we got to
get rid of the obam
cages don't you think I think it should
be a goal of the administration to get
rid of obam
cages all right
um Corey Booker
is proposing
legislation to create a reparations
commission a commission to look into
reparations for
slavery now my first reaction to that
was next
meaning that it's such a nonstarter for
a national political
campaign that it would make him
irrelevant as a candidate that it would
it would be such a um such a provocative
stand that he would not really be a
credible candidate for president and
then I saw that most of the most of the
Democrats have to agree with it or at
least AG agree with looking into it or
agree to try to make something happen
there and I thought to myself the the
problem of them being too
woke is is really displayed in this
issue because I don't know that any
Democratic candidate could win the
nomination coming out against that it
would be better if it had never been
mentioned in terms of Politics as soon
as the first candidate candidate gets
serious about it and that was Booker so
now that Booker has gotten serious about
it the other candidates have to answer
to it they have to answer a yes no
question are you for or against it I
don't think Trump will have trouble with
the question but the Democrats can have
real trouble because if they say no they
can't get the nomination and if they say
yes they can't get elected president so
Corey Booker has set up an almost compl
complete um
trap making it impossible for any
Democrat to get elected Am I Wrong Am I
Wrong that you could not get the
nomination now unless you come out in
favor of reparations because you
wouldn't be woke enough if you didn't
and if you do and you get the
nomination Trump is going to slaughter
you just Slaughter it is not even going
to be
close now there's one thing that um I
don't think we've seen
yet there's something we haven't seen
yet but if Trump ends up running against
reparations you're going to see it and
it's going to look like
this successful black people and even
maybe some who are not successful yet
are going to come out and say F that you
give us reparations and it's going to
make us look like second class citizens
there there will be black
people very aggressively coming out
against this idea because it's going to
make
them um it's going to put a Target on
their back it's going to make them seem
like less than regular citizens so I
think you're going to see the
reparations things is a double-edged
sword on on an intellectual uh let's say
on a scholarly level you can make a case
for it you know we're we're all familiar
with what the argument is that the uh
the African-American population of the
country has such a disadvantage coming
from that Legacy that maybe the country
owes some kind of an
evening eventually somebody's going to
say um let's let's be scientific about
this if the if the argument is God can I
even say this without losing everything
I have
this is one of those questions you have
to stop and ask yourself when you talk
in
public what I'm going to say is Innocent
but how easily it could be taken out of
context
uh maybe
not
yeah maybe not may maybe I will save
myself for a better fight okay um but
we'll maybe we'll Circle back to that
another
day oh no screw
I'm just going to say it
[Laughter]
anyway if the reparations argument gets
serious somebody's going to say what is
your reference point in other words what
is your reference point for saying
here's where the um the American
africanamerican Community is and and
what are you comparing it
to when we get to that question of who
are you comparing it to
things are going to get
ugly because somebody sooner or later
somebody's going to
say how would you be doing if you had
never come to this country by force and
they're going to say I'm not saying this
let let me let me clarify this is not my
opinion somebody's going to say how
would you have done if you would not
come to this country by force as slaves
and the they're going to say should we
compare you to the people who didn't
come is that the right
comparison because if you compare them
to say an average African citizen are
they doing better than the average
African citizen or
worse now do you hear do you feel how
ugly that is like that point that's an
ugly point but somebody's going to say
it and then that argument is going to
get really racist and really bad
because the the reparations thing and by
the way um I I have written I I have
personally
written back in 2016 I think not that
long ago that we should consider
reparations so just to be
clear I have come out saying we should
seriously think about a way to do this
because there's a bad way to do it and
there's a good way now I'm going to
suggest a way that avoids that ugly
problem I just
mentioned the the good way to do it is
what I'm I'm going to call it the hawk
and
Nome uh approach and I'll give him
credit for this uh Hawk as you know had
been I'm not I think he's still
associated with black lives matter of
New York and his idea was that any any
policy you do for the country that helps
the African-American part of the
population ends up helping
everybody and and it's one of those
points that that you have to think about
for a while to see that there's actually
some depth to the point that even if
you're thinking about helping the
African-American Community there's
nothing you can do in a rule of laws
that wouldn't also help everybody who's
in a similar situation meaning anybody
who's got an economic disadvantage for
example
so if we came up with let's say
reparations is just prioritizing
education at the top free education so
let let me say this let's say Bernie
Sanders I'll give Bernie some uh some
free advice if Bernie Sanders
says let's make education
free as a as a response to reparations
it's not reparations because it would be
free for everybody college and and let's
say trade trade training so any kind of
training for an adult education an
adult um skill set any kind of training
would be free at least as a goal if
you're Burnie let's say you're burning
and you're saying this and you say that
this is our way to
address a
reparations without making it unfair to
the uh rest of the PO population who did
not get any advantages from from the
legacy of slavery so if you if you
framed it that way you would simply have
taken a whole bunch of priorities and
you say what what's what's our top
priority free health care free education
you know um higher minimum wage what's
our
priority and you just say because of
reparations we'll make our top priority
education because that has a societal
benefit but it has an unusually good
benefit for anybody who's at the lowest
part of the economic um
situation all
right so I'm not saying that would be
necessarily the best idea in the world
but what I'm saying is that when you
talk about reparations it could be a
really wide conversation and there might
actually be a way to do it that even
that everybody in the country says huh
because remember there's there's always
a second benefit to anything that you
call reparations that people say is a
good idea the second benefit is the
psychological benefit uh I would argue
that one of the great powers of this
country is a rule of law treating
everybody equally as best we can you
know we we have to tweak this every
generation you know the laws got to get
tweaked to to make sure that we're still
staying on our on our
brand but one of the great things this
country did was brand itself as a
Melting
Pot so when it when when America branded
itself as a Melting Pot and started to
socialize the children with that
term Generations grew up saying that one
of our powers you know one of the powers
of being an American is that we can
absorb different cultures and turn that
into
Power the United States probably more
than any country yeah I'm not a
historian there may be other examples
where this has worked but I would argue
that the United States um as a as a
manufactured country meaning you know
we're we're created by people coming in
from lots of different places we're you
know mostly a manufactured
country uh ancient Rome somebody says
there might be another example of this
but probably nobody at least in the
modern times has done a better job of
turning what could be a problem which is
all kinds of different people trying to
live together naturally that would be a
problem right you would expect but we've
somehow
cleverly managed to turn that into a
strength and I think that that's
legitimate as many problems as you get
from having different types of people
and those are real those are real
problems when you have different types
of people living in the same place I
think we've legitimately turned it into
a strength I think that's real and it's
amazing and it's a it's a psychological
invention it's a psychological invention
as powerful as you know the steam engine
it was that powerful for for creating
the America that we have
so if you have a little bit of a let's
say a defect in your invention and I'm
going to say the invention is the
psychological invention that the that
America is a Melting Pot and the idea
that we do that well and we can convert
that into strength that's the invention
and we've had that invention guiding us
for for Generations but it's a little
bit defective because there's still this
problem with our invention
that the legacy of slavery is making
people uncomfortable in different ways
so if we could fix just that little
tweak with our great invention of the
Melting Pot you know mental construct if
we could do that at the same time that
we're getting people better
education maybe that's a maybe that's a
win who knows all right let's talk about
uh I want to
do since I've it's a slow news day so
I'm going to do something for fun I
promised you when I had my other
technology that today I was going to do
you a
demonstration of cognitive
dissonance I'm going to plug in my other
headphone and we're going to do
that all right all right assuming that
you can hear me
I'm going to take some
calls but I'm going to take some calls
from people who want to tell me that
uranium
one was a big problem for the country
all right so I so the only topic I'm
going to take is somebody who wants to
tell me that the uranium one situation
was a big problem and Hillary Clinton
should go to jail for it or whether or
not she goes to jail it doesn't matter
but that you think it was big Scandal
and a big problem so anybody who thinks
that that's the only the only topic I'm
taking and I will take some guest
callers and we'll see and I'll I'll make
the call quick if you only wanted to
talk about something else so Hello
Alex hey are you here to talk about
uranium one he sure am uh do you think
uranium one was a big problem affects
the United States in a strategic
way I think it is a problem um legally
the way that has been handled I think
that it was swept under the rug oh hold
on that that's uh that I will I will
accept that there are some legal
questions there but that's not the
interesting part do you have would you
say that beyond the fact there are some
legal
questions does it have an effect on the
Readiness of the United States the the
Strategic strength of the United States
or in any way that's I was going next is
that I think that it may have only if it
had been uncovered we would have known
but we are unable to see because none of
the information has really ever come out
other than little tidbits here and there
that were reported because media mostly
has been just you know CNN and all right
so aside aside from the legal part which
is
important what are you worried that
there's a strategic thing that that we
lost because we sold that those rights
are you wor you worried that we're worse
off as a country I I would have no idea
to that information like I wouldn't know
but I'm not
concerned uh that's fair you have a
reasonable view but um I'm G to take
another caller I want to get I I want to
get somebody who's going to argue that
it
matters all right let's see if Doug this
looks like a troll possibly a troll
because he's using my own character as
his
uh
icon caller can you hear me he you hi
are you here to talk about uranium one
yes I am do you think that the United
States was weakened or lost anything by
the uranium one deal uh I believe that's
possible if uh things I've heard are
true I don't know that they're true I
have no way to confirm it but what if
what I heard is true then yes I believe
so and what would be an example of
something you heard that if it were true
would be bad for the country for the
uranium one deal uh what I believe I
read was that the uranium going through
Russia was being processed out to Iran
for their program uh which would of
course be a huge problem for
us okay I haven't heard any of that
um uh I have heard that the uh the stuff
from the United States couldn't be
released from the United States
without uh official permission so for
example uh another country couldn't buy
it if they wanted to it would have to be
sold inside the United States but I'm
not sure about that that's one all right
let me let me take another caller I want
I'm looking I'm looking for somebody who
is really who really buys into the whole
story let's say
Joe all right firus Joe coming at you
Joe good how are you do you have a
uranium one opinion uh yes uh I do I
don't know if it's going to be able to
Trump what you're about to lay down but
um basically with uranium one what the
issue I I think would be other than
potential corruption in the future as
far as what other countries uh think
that they're going to get from us as
well but the crossover
of the of the crossover of of the
nuclear going around to different
countries that if you know as the media
says Russia is their enemy then it's
sort of odd that we're you know in bed
in a situation where we're getting
uranium trading it to to different
places um doing it in a way that is um I
guess National Security wise the biggest
biggest uh danger would be the fact
about how they're actually transferring
it because okay uh do do you know that
the uranium is a product on the open
market and that pretty much anybody can
buyer from one of the countries that
sells it I did not know that yeah so um
what I was hoping to get here is
apparently most of you are too smart or
or you know there was a trap I was
trying to see if anybody would come here
and say that Russia got 20% of our
critical uranium resources oh no because
that's that's sort of the story you hear
from some pundits and that that by
itself is the problem the problem is
that this is a valuable National
resource and that we're giving it to our
you know potential Nemesis uh Russia um
but it sounds like everybody here is too
smart for that so so thanks Joe and I I
will end my experiment there all right
what I expected was that some of you
would come on here and say no we're
giving away our critical resource and
then I was going to tell you that your
critical resource um is 6% of domestic
production six it's 6% of domestic
production and you can buy it anywhere
you can buy it from Canada you can get
your uranium from um Australia now you
might say to yourself well wait a minute
wouldn't it be better to have it than to
have to go buy it and the answer is
either way you have to buy it just the
fact that the mine is in the United
States doesn't make it free there's some
company that owns the mine you can go to
that company and you can buy it you can
still go to that company and buy it just
because Russia has an interest in a mine
that's located in the United States that
doesn't make it
Russia not really I mean if we got in a
war with Russia would Russia still be
able to take their you know their
uranium out of their mind that's located
in the United States I don't think so so
we still have control over it we can buy
it on the open market uranium one was
never a real problem except that there
might have been some Clinton you know
quid pro quo there that we'll never
we'll never identify
anyway yeah I thought this would be
interesting because I thought some of
you would be hypnotized by the story
and uh but apparently you're not you're
you're all Way Beyond that and that's
good all right uh did Hillary receive a
dollar from this transaction well some
of the accusation is that uh Bill
Clinton got half a million dollars for
speaking in Russia now you'd have to
know how different is half a million
dollars from what he normally
earned and it might not be that that was
too far man his market price I'd have to
see that but that's not an Evidence so
anyway uh I will end here and I'll talk
to you later
