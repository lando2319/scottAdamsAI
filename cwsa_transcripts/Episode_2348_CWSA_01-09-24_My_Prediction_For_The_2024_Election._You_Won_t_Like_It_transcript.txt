good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure there's never been a better
time in the history of the world but if
You' like this experience to go up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny human brains all you
need is a cuper Mugger glass a tanker
Chell ory and a canteen Jugger flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine the other the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
that's right the simultaneous sip savor
it ah
delightful well let me talk about some
of the technology news and then we'll
get to my prediction for the first time
this will be my first prediction for the
2024
election you're not going to like
it you're not going to like it at all
but you will you will experience it well
Apple has introduced its uh glasses I
think they're
$3,500 February 2nd look come out and uh
I guess it's virtual reality glasses
there's lots of talk about how they'll
Incorporated in
AI now there is a lot of uncertainty
happening around Apple at the moment and
I would ask you the following question
I'd be interested in the comments what
you think without knowing too much about
this new product the the Apple goggle
glasses
thing do you think that Steve Jobs would
have introduced this product without
even seeing it without even seeing it do
you think Steve Jobs would have
introduced this
product I don't know I feel like
no I feel like no but how do you know
right um so Apple has the following
things going on they got a you know
virtual reality they're going into that
hard uh they're introducing AI
apparently their AI will be integrated
into the function of the
phone uh but their biggest risk in my
opinion is companies that are going to
make a phone that is AI
native I think what apple is going to do
because it has to protect its existing
base of business it has to integrate AI
into something that looks like the same
phone that they've always produced and I
don't know if that's the best way to go
I'd rather have a phone that has a blank
screen and I just say uh call
Bob and it calls Bob I just want
something I can talk to and it does what
I want it to do that's that's the phone
I want and I think that's who Apple's
going to be competing with I think
they're going to compete with a phone
where you just start working and the AI
figures out what it is you wanted to do
so for example let's say you don't want
to talk you're in
public so you're not in a place you can
talk to your phone so you want to send a
message in the current model you have to
search around for your message app it's
like am I using Whatsapp or am I texting
or what am I doing but I think it would
make more sense if you just set a blank
screen and you just take out your phone
and you start typing a
message and then as you
type um three buttons appear do you want
to send it by WhatsApp or regular text
message or something else and then after
you're done with the message then you
can pick which way to send it but the
way you do it now is that you're
thinking about the message you want to
compose but you have to first work
through the interface to find the app
and open it and stuff that's terrible
mental cost you want to do work first
and then at the
end poke the app that's going to execute
that's how you should do it if you start
putting some numbers on a page it should
turn into a it should turn into a uh
spreadsheet it should just automatically
turn into a spreadsheet because you're
doing numbers that sort of thing so I
think Apple has
gigantic um potential risks but also
gigantic upside so I sold my Apple stock
because I didn't want a company with
gigantic upside and gigantic
downside um I already hold it I have
index funds so I've got Apple exposure
anyway but I don't want to I no longer
want to have an exposure in the company
itself
specifically um because the reason I
held the stock indiv indvidually was
because they were a
monopoly and I liked putting my money in
a monopoly because nobody nobody was
going to knock him out of
business but with VR and Ai and uh all
that I would say they're no longer a
monopoly so you don't know what you're
getting it could be it could be the best
investment of all time because it could
double and triple because of all the new
stuff or something else right Samsung
introduced a uh robot that looks like a
little ball that rolls around on the
floor and it's got a cool feature as a
projector so you can tell it to project
on the wall or it can project on the
floor so it can give you a message like
hello or something uh it can do stuff
like control your your household
appliances and feed the dog and stuff
like that but it doesn't have any arms
so it has no arms it just rolls around
and it looks at things and IT projects
things and it can communicate with
things
but looks pretty cool I wouldn't get one
uh especially because there's a Tesla
robot coming and the Tesla robot in
addition to a human form
factor they're working on a Tesla dog
robot now that doesn't mean they'll
produce one but apparently they're
playing with a dog model how much would
you want a Tesla dog
robot like if I didn't have a human
Tesla robot plan to have a robot
soon I plan to be an early adopter of
the robot technology I feel like I might
start with a
dog you know the dog isn't going to be
able to empty my dishwasher I want that
to probably can't iron my
shirts as if I iron
shirts I I I said that like I've ironed
a shirt any time in the last 10 years
have I ironed a shirt in 10 years yeah I
have when I traveled
I guess maybe within 10 years I've
ironed a shirt but in a hotel not at
home um see I want my Tesla robot dog
that would be so cool I can't even stand
it give me that now uh President Biden
is a post on social media that Americans
in 30 states are now paying under $3 a
gallon to fill up their tanks quick
survey so three out of five of you well
we don't know which states it is but
let's say if it were just by States
three and of five of you would say your
gas prices are under
$3 go are your gas prices where you live
under $3 go yes yes yes no no no no no
no yes yes yes yes yes no no no no lots
of yeses lots of NOS I'm pretty sure my
gas price is still over
$5 in California because the California
 they put on top of it plus we
don't have any refineries locally plus
all that yeah I am so jealous of your $3
gas if I had $3
gas I would feel like everything was
okay I think I could get over almost
everything else if my gas 265 that's
amazing Colorado two
$2.70 all right well so do we give Biden
credit for this or what
you tell
me if if your preferred president were
president would you give that President
credit I don't know anything that Biden
did he you know at one point he used the
uh the national
reserves but that benefit presumably is
already worked through the system and no
longer is affecting prices I
think so what is it that Biden did
exactly is he claiming credit for not
not clamping down on drilling as much as
he promised he would is that the basis
of his success that he didn't do the
policies he
promised it sounds like it was it wasn't
he he said directly I'm going to shut
down the fossil fuel
industry did I imagine that I mean in
the long run not in the short
run but it am I is this too far am I
saying something this crazy that the
reason he's claiming success is that he
did not Institute the policies he
promised which would have put more
pressure on gas prices not
less feels like that I don't know I need
a fact check on that but it feels like
his doing less than he said he would do
is why we had
success maybe he could just keep doing
less things would be great that would
just be
great all right
um it's
$635 a gallon in Europe is that
Euros all right um Wall Street Journal
is reporting that ESG is a dirty word
now by the way that's not my
interpretation of their article that's
actually the title the title of the
article is that ESG is a dirty word have
have we done our job well I think we
have
I I think we've done our job now I don't
think it's going away a lot of it is
just they're changing the names of it
some of them are changing their framing
of it to more of the environmental part
you know they're going to focus on the E
not not the G so much the governance
part but I think this is a good sign
that businesses are embarrassed to be in
the ESG business as you know Black Rock
was push pushing it and then they backed
off from it at least the
words so what do you make of the fact
that it's
embarrassing it's actually embarrassing
to admit to your shareholders that
you're involved in
ESG that it's all
downside and by the way you know uh I
don't have a big problem that companies
would try to be better corporate
citizens but the ESG stuff's
crazy University of Michigan uh has uh
Dei
employees uh take a guess if you didn't
see the story how many Dei employees do
you need to staff your college Dei
department just take a guess in the
comments how how many do you think would
be a full
compliment if you guessed
hundreds you would be
right they have
241 employees who do nothing but
Dei
241 people at one
college one
college now what does that say to you
about the VA value of that college
degree who would want a degree from that
college they obviously are completely
incompetent and and of control and
poorly
managed my God so if you want to put
this in context as Steve Maguire did in
a post on X uh the they're spending $23
million a year for salaries then then
you had the benefits it's like $30
million a year for the staff for $30
million they could cover instate tuition
and fees for about 1,800 undergraduate
students about 1,800 students could go
to school for free if they would get rid
of their Dei department and use that
money I I love that Dei is just and Es
year just now disgraced Concepts
probably not in the bluest of blue
places but in most of the Ordinary
World well Biden said uh in a post for
too long our tax code has rewarded
wealth not work increasing income and
wealth inequality in America and he says
working Americans pay their
taxes all right
so what do you think about this uh fair
share
business do you you know I've said this
before one of the reasons
that the word fair was
invented was so that idiots and children
had some way to participate in
conversations because you know what is
fair nothing there's nothing Fair
nothing in this world is
fair it can't be I mean it's just a
logical impossibility and the reason is
that fair is subjective have have you
ever seen a situation where everybody
was happy and they said well that looks
fair to me no you've only said you've
only seen situations where some people
say that looks fair to me and other
people say that looks unfair to me and
there's no objective standard to decide
what is fair so fairness whenever you
see it employed is pure propaganda
there's no rational logical basis to it
whatsoever there's no standard to
compare it to as soon as you hear the
word Fair
don't participate in the conversation
because you're not talking to a
legitimate honest broker of conversation
you're talking to somebody who's trying
to bamboozle you basically so fairness
is a word of bamboozlers and con artists
or children and idiots right so if
you're not a child and you're not an
idiot and you're using that words is
because you're talking
to
children or idiots because there is no
smart person anywhere who believes that
fairness is some kind of a standard you
could actually
employ nobody believes that all right
nobody's smart all right remember I told
you that uh you don't really know a
story until you know the players and who
they're married to and how they make
their money and all that stuff just what
they say doesn't tell you much but if
you know who they are plus what they say
that might tell you something here's an
example you know you all know the story
of uh General Austin had the Secretary
of
Defense
um and he uh disappeared into the
hospital without getting the message out
to his bosses there's some might have
been a mixup there uh but whatever the
problem was he was off the grid and
maybe not even conscious he was in the
hospital without people knowing he was
missing at a time when the country is at
Great military
Peril um um so I think it was CNN or
maybe MSNBC it doesn't matter but one of
them had John Brennan on to talk about
this now what do you know when you hear
that John Brennan was asked to be a
guest and he he he talked about this
problem what do you know all right John
Brennan is who you is who you invite on
the news when you have the following
situation that you want to
accomplish what you accomplish is
there's a news cycle that's working
against you and that means Democrats so
the news is unfriendly to Democrats and
everybody believes they understand the
story oh I understand the story and it's
bad for Democrats in that case you need
somebody to come in and introduce a new
narrative that will give you at least
some question about whether the obvious
explanation is the true one for example
Hunter's laptop the obvious explanation
was it's actually his
laptop that's the obvious explanation so
John brenen comes on and says oh I don't
know a lot of Intel people talk to
everybody and they think it looks like
Russian
disinformation so here he took a story
with that's bad for Democrats and it was
pretty obvious what the situation was it
was Hunter's
laptop but he introduced the new
narrative that might be Russian
disinformation so now you've got this
bassing story about the Secretary of
Defense which would suggest that Biden's
white house is completely unmanaged
because if you're not managing military
command during days like this you're not
really managing anything so this's a
story that's bad for
Democrats the the secretary of defense
was unavailable and nobody
knew so they bring on John Brenan and he
introduces a new
narrative and the new narrative is well
he he just said it sort of as a toss off
he goes well we're not sure if his
medical condition is a reason for his
poor judgment and why he didn't inform
people that's pretty
good that's pretty good because I
couldn't think of a good reason for why
we would be seeing this news and why he
wouldn't tell people or maybe he did but
he told somebody who had a cold and I
know he told somebody who had Co or
something and it didn't get through so
whatever the story is
it it just still looks incompetent no
matter what the details are it looks
like incompetence but you introduce this
new narrative it's like well you knew he
was in the hospital and he couldn't
function so if he's in the hospital he
can't function and then he does
something that sounds like somebody who
couldn't
function it all makes sense it's not so
bad it'd be a bad situation but you say
oh it was it was medical so you give it
a different different uh vibe to it so
my only point about this I'm not really
too interested in the general loss of
the story but the fact that they bring
John Brennan on to introduce the new
narrative you understand that's pure
propaganda right that's not news that
that is pure
propaganda all right and also you can't
get other people to say it who would
have credibility so they needed somebody
with a high level of cred
ability to introduce a new thought it
was the perfect
one all right there's a axios
reporting um now again put this in the
context of uh an election
year does it surprise you to hear that
as we launched the election year the
axios is reporting oh the biggest
surprise story you could ever have in an
election year that 2023 was the hottest
uh year in 125,000
years now could you have
predicted that the news would tell you
and axios in particular would tell you
that it was the hottest year last year I
could have predicted that without any
science at all because it's bad for
republicans and good for Democrats
that's it that's all you have to know in
order to measure the Earth would you
like would you like to see me measure
the temperature of the Earth again
watch it's an election
year uh warming of the earth to new
records would be terrible for
Republicans good for
Democrats concentrate yes oh I see the
temperatures now yes yes they're up half
a
degree that's how you measure the
temperature in an election year now do I
have to go through the details to
convince you that we can't measure the
temperature over 125,000
years do does anybody need even five
seconds of why nobody in the
world can measure the temperature of the
earth to within a degree or two over 125
 thousand years because you know
I could give you the conversation about
why you can't measure it
today do you do you think you can
measure it today within a degree or so
and then measure it over time it is
absurd to imagine that that's some a
capability that humans have the Earth is
a pretty big place and the problem is
that even if you have lots of
thermometers things can happen to the
thermometer but also the Earth does not
have a uniform kind of common
temperature rather has Hot Pockets they
can stay hot for a long time cool
pockets and sometimes those change out
sometimes your hot pocket becomes cooler
and vice versa but if you don't have a
thermometer probably you know every
square mile or so over the entire Earth
including the oceans you're not really
measuring
anything you you might be able to
measure the measurements you have
changing over time but there might be
other reasons for that change could be
where they are what happens since they
were put in could be that the the he
sink is going somewhere it didn't used
to go a lot of possibilities but no you
cannot measure the temperature of the
earth
accurately it someday that will just
seem funny you know 100 years from now
there will be history courses where they
laugh because they thought that they
could measure the temperature of the
Earth with some thermometers and some
satellite images you were satellite
measurements nope can't do
it at least not that level um and then
other people pointed out that the ice
levels are the highest they've ever been
do you believe that's true there's a
claim that our ice levels are the
highest they've ever
been do you think we can measure
accurately how much ice there
is all right so this might be on the the
side that you agree with so if you agree
with the people who are not worried
about climate you might agree with the
people who say that the amount of ice is
increasing instead of
decreasing do you think we can measure
the amount of
ice seriously do you really think we can
measure the amount of ice no and you
know we can't because you've been
watching them try for years and you'll
see a story say oh we measured this ice
and it's you know it's down by two feet
and you wait a week and there'll be
somebody else says oh we measured the
ice and we made a big mistake yes it was
decreasing here but it was increasing
over over here and we didn't catch that
you've been watching this for years no
they cannot accurately measure any
 ice just like they can't
accurately measure the
temperature stop pretending these things
can be measured to some degree where you
can really see the change no those are
real things so don't believe the
Skeptics but don't believe the science
on this they can't measure this
stuff all right
um a few years ago I made a bet on a
betting platform and the BET was I think
it was predicted or something I bet I
never told you this by the way I bet
that it would be reported to be the
highest temperature that year of any
year now the reason I bet that is not
because I know anything about science I
just figured every year they're going to
say it's the hottest year to me it
seemed like a no-brainer I'll just I'll
just put us some money on the fact that
they're going to say again
again it's the hottest year but you know
what I got
wrong I made that bet on a non-election
year and it wasn't it wasn't the hottest
year if I had had if I had had even the
smallest bit of brain uh working I would
have bet maybe a week or two ago or
whatever that 2023 would be recorded as
the hottest year on record do you think
that would have been a smart bet
yes the odds that they would have said
that 2023 was not the hottest record
hottest on record in an election year
was zero there was Zero
chance they were going to say it wasn't
a record no matter what the actual
measurements
are I'm so mad at myself that this is
like a bet that wasn't a bet you know
the first time it was kind of a bet but
in an election year it's not even a bat
it it's just basically it's dialed in I
could have just like collected my money
if I just waited I'm an idiot boom next
time I'll get it next then all right um
can you become president of the United
States if none of the citizens you've
ever met let's say if as a as a voter
can you become president of the United
States if the voters have never met
anybody who supports you and voted for
you well we might find out
because there's a poll out of New
Hampshire interactive polls I don't know
how scientific it was but it shows Trump
at 39% in the primary in Haley Dicky Hy
at
32% and chrisy at 12 do you really
think in the real world that hay has 32%
support in New
Hampshire I still don't know anybody in
person who supports Nikki Haley I do
know a person or two online that I
haven't seen in person but they seem
like real people so I think they exist
but in your wildest imagination do you
really think Haley is at 32% in New
Hampshire does that
sound possible do you think it's women I
don't know I don't know so I'm not I'm
not believing any of those polls but
could we have a president where you know
anybody who voted for that person I
think we're at that place we could I I
think you know I'm not I'm not
predicting this will
happen but I think we're at a place
where you could actually have a
president and you would never meet
anybody in your whole life who voted for
them that could actually happen we're
we're at a point of brainwashing and
gaslighting that could literally happen
a president that you don't know anybody
who ever voted for and they that could
serve out 8
years yeah that that's actually
something that can happen in our current
environment it couldn't have always
happened but at the moment we're so
primed for literally anything from UFOs
to you name it yeah they could do
that uh Trump is doing his usual
provocations that get taken out of
context so here he's being quoted as
saying that he hopes the economy crashes
in the next 12 months because quote I
don't want to be Herbert Hoover now
Herbert Hoover was president when the
economy crashed so he was always famous
as our you know worst president for
economics um although there's a dispute
whether he was really that bad you know
some some say not so bad but uh what
Trump was saying was he would hate to be
the president when the economy crashes
so when he says he hopes the economy
crashes in the next 12
months
it was so that he wouldn't be president
what it happened now how seriously
should you take
that he he's the potential next
president and he said he hopes the
economy crashes in the next month 12
months because I don't want to be
Herbert Hoover seriously how seriously
should you take
that that's just Trump being Trump he's
just saying he doesn't want to be in a
situation where he has bad luck and he
gets blam for destroying the economy so
if it's going to tank he wants it to
tank before he gets there so that he can
be the one who recovers it now how
seriously should you take that come on
that that's like a big headline today
nobody should take that
seriously literally nobody should
believe that in in the actual World
Trump
prefers that the economy
tanks at all like who believes that he
wants it to tank
nobody he doesn't want it to tank I
think my interpretation is if it's going
to tank on his
own what's best for him is it happens
fast so then he could be the one to fix
it it's not exactly the worst thing in
the world to say it's just a very
trump-like way to put it like once you
get used to him you can just hear this
and go okay I know what you're saying
what he's saying is he doesn't want to
have bad luck that's all but he also
thinks he could fix the economy if it
Tanked I have no problem with that at
all but it's the election year so
everything he says will be taken out of
context who how many of you are watching
the ongoing social media battle between
Elon Musk and Mark cubin because it just
keeps getting
better it's the best dollar value for
entertainment that I've seen in the
longest
time so I'll give you a little update on
that so Mark cubin is pro
Dei and and uh you know he's got some
complaints about mosque and musos has
some complaints about Cuban so they made
some accusations back and forth but Elon
Musk uh posts a video of Mark cubin in
some event he's on stage and it's on a
context of course but cubin is saying
that he is um he's Prejudiced and
bigoted and that for example if you were
walking down the street at night and you
saw a black teenage in a
hoodie uh he would cross the street to
get away from the black teenager in the
hoodie so
musk mus posts that and he goes this
explains Mark Cuban's ridiculous
overcompensation regarding racism same
thing happened with me too guys who got
busted suddenly became fake ardan
feminists um yeah now I remember oh
shoot
yeah
remember
um that
uh sorry I had to fix my screen it keeps
going turning off
here
um so remember they're they're after
each other a little bit so don't take
much of it too seriously uh later musk
said he posted Mark Cuban is a racist
okay he also posted that uh he's a liar
separately so he's called them a liar an
overcompensator a
racist um and the racist comment was
because Cuban said recently that a
private school if they wanted to have
only one kind of person at the school
it's their choice because it's a private
school to which mus says that's
racist which it is right if you had a
private school and you said I'm only
going to allow a specific
race it doesn't need to be government to
be racist does it doesn't that count as
racist so I I think I would back uh Elon
Musk on that
so I don't know that their conversation
is particularly important but it sure is
fun and it got more fun when somebody uh
surfaced a trump post from 2014 I don't
remember this news but apparently back
then Mark Cuban tried to buy a baseball
team and and oh no he buy tried to buy
an NBA team and he was
rejected and no he's trying to buy
baseball team not an NBA team and
uh apparently uh Trump sent him a
message that said I'm truly
sorry I'm mixing up two different
stories one of them is that
uh Trump called Cuban an in
2014 so Trump doesn't like uh Mark Cuban
I didn't when do you remember when Mark
cubin was was very Pro or
anti-trump and you wondered what was up
with that and it looked kind of personal
well apparently it was really personal
so a lot of what looked like politics
was you know two billionaires who had
had some past so once you see the
history you understand why he so
anti-trump um but also it gets worse uh
I guess Mark Cuban tried to do a TV show
called The benefactor and it didn't work
out and Trump sent him a
uh Trump sent him a letter I'm G to
leave a typed a typed and signed letter
from Trump when when Cubans uh TV show
failed and
the this is what Trump said I'm truly
sorry to hear that your show has been
canceled for lack of ratings when I
called to congratulate you on the
benefact
little did you or I realize how
disastrous and embarrassing it would
turn out to be for
you and then Trump says if you ever
decide to do another show please call me
and I will be happy to lend a helping
hand and then here's the best
part uh the best part is that he signs
his letter
sincerely Donald Trump he signed that
letter
sincerely
sincerely now apparently he's been
hilarious for years you know before
before it came to my attention I didn't
realize he was such a troll before he
ran for president but yeah he's been
he's been battling people like crazy all
right there's also a story about uh
Jesse Waters is talking about this and
others so this Fanny um Fanny Willis
who's a DE for Fon County going after uh
Trump for the Georgia stuff uh
apparently the prosecutor that she hired
to put on the case is her
lover she hired her lover to be the what
they say overpaid and highly
underqualified hasn't done much of this
work so he's underqualified overpaid and
her lover and apparently this is known
and then related to the story and
nobody's nobody's denying the
accusations uh and then related to the
story is a separately that the
prosecutor who was her lover I
guess uh visited with the white house
before making their play so the the
think is the thinking is that the White
House may have been coordinating the
local da actions which would be highly
inappropriate and ricol like and it
would look like a coordinated illegal
Behavior so who knows if any anything
will come with that but it looks pretty
super sketchy to me let me ask you this
do you think there's any chance that the
local Das did not coordinate with the
white house or at least operatives from
the White House I would say that's in
the category of
obvious like I wouldn't need a news
story to know that the federal type
people are involved and talking to them
and you know giving them encouragement
do you think somebody like Fanny Willis
has already been promised um some big
role in future politics if she takes
Trump
down I would guess yes whether it's
stated whether it's stated obviously or
implied I would I would think she's just
doing it for career reasons pure career
career development but she and her
boyfriends seem to be making at least
even he's making a lot of
money H all right so here's
update on the you know the the case of
the fake electors the so-called fake
electors that Trump and his staff
allegedly tried to pull together so that
they could take over the country with
their fake electors instead of using the
real ones so that's the story we've been
told that they had these alternative
lectors it was illegal because that's
not the way the process works so it
turns out none of that was
true that whole story was
fake here's the real story that's just
coming
out actually I don't know how how
recently this came out but
um it turns
out that
um these the so-called fake
electors there's documentation
describing what they were up to so in
writing you know contemporaneous when it
was happening in writing there's
documentation that shows they were not
intending to be fake substitute electors
they very clearly said the only point of
this is to have some people lined up to
be
Replacements if the legal challenges
succeed so that you can maintain your
legal right to continue your challenge
so apparently the whole point of having
the alternate alternative electors in
writing and in words were not to be fake
electors it was to preserve their legal
rights to continue the procedural
challenges so the entire basis of the
claim is known to be debunked on
documents that very clearly say the
intention of this is just to keep our
rights open not to take over the
country isn't that freaking
amazing that that that kind of news is
just sort of bubbling up now I think
it's been known for a while but it
wasn't known to
me now they use a different word yeah
there are different words like you know
provisional and whatever but they very
clearly stated these are not trying to
be fake electors these are like
alternative provisional just keeping our
options open kind of
thing it is a lie says somebody well
it's in writing all
right you all heard about that door that
flew off a a plane and I guess United
Airlines has found at least five of
those kinds of doors with loose bolts uh
those are on Boeing 737 Max
planes
and um I I heard the story last night
about you know how the the door blew off
but then the the seat that was closest
to the door just by big coincidence was
empty like that's the biggest
coincidence in the world that that one
seat was empty that person missed the
flight can you imagine that you imagine
if you had been on that flight and the
door next to you just flew off and
you're like you're basically you're in
the elements you're basically flying
Outdoors at 10,000
fet the level of fear that that would
give me would be you know just
outrageous I would never fly again for
sure but uh of course all the buzz on
social media is whether this is uh
because of diversity hiring let me ask
you do you think that the specific
problem with these plug doors is because
of diversity
hiring all right well
here's all right anything's possible but
I think it's completely unfair to take
any specific case and say that this is
because of University hiring I think if
you had to bet I would bet against it I
would bet against it if I had to bet but
maybe here here's what's a more fair way
to talk about this topic uh I'm
completely
convinced that diversity hiring in a in
a general sense over time on average
lowers the competency of the of the
workforce now that's based on UN based
on anybody's ethnicity not based on
their gender or any of that it's based
on just math because there's a small
pool of people that fit the diversity
criteria there's not enough of them so
that you could hire people of equal
quality so you can have to go down the
you you're G have to go further and
further down the quality level in order
to get somebody because there just
aren't enough so has nothing to do with
your ethnicity or your genes it's just
math we should see all things being
equal we should see a decline in
competency but I think it's terribly
unfair to pick one like one business
failure and say oh that one that one
looks like it's diversity so don't get
over your don't get too far over your
skis you know you could easily find out
that this had nothing to do with
anything you know maybe just bad
luck but your general fear that uh we
could be you know dying or in deep
trouble because of our lack of
confidence that's real there there's
absolutely a very
noticeable decline in
capability of
workers that I've never seen less
competent employees everywhere just
everywhere it's just massive
incompetence everywhere so I think we
all see that there's a new chip you can
put in a monkey that will change its
Behavior
you can turn a little mck
monkey um you can make it lower its risk
or increase its
risk and so you could make a monkey have
a gambling addiction by tweaking the
chip one way and you could tweak it the
other way and you could remove the
addiction now they're already saying of
course this may have application for
people but I would be more worried that
we're uh weaponizing
monkeys because I don't want a monkey
with a chip in his head I mean
that's we're talking trouble because if
the monkeys start coordinating
and I don't know I just don't like the
idea of chips in the monkey's brain it
just feels like that could go
wrong well the Missouri Secretary of
State uh has a clever thing to say so
the Missouri secret secretary of state
is opposed to attempts by Colorado and
Maine to remove Trump from the
ballot uh obviously Missouri is a
republican kind of a state um so if that
happens if Colorado and Maine take Trump
off the ballot the Missouri says they'll
remove Biden from the Missouri ballot
for giving Aid to the invasion of our
Southern border to which I say how in
the world is that
legal and then the second thing I say oh
I actually don't
care I don't care if it's legal
I'm glad they would do it because
obviously taking off the Colorado and
Main ballots might be legal I doubt it
it might be but it's so sketchy that if
a Republican state did something that
was just flat out
illegal I would only care if they got
away with
it right I generally I'm pretty much in
favor of Law and Order but you know if
you're trying to uh write a wrong yes
two wrongs would make
well two wrongs wouldn't make it right
but one of the wrongs might compensate
for the other wrong wouldn't make it
right but it might get you to a better
place so I'm fully fully uh supportive
of threatening to take Biden off the
ballot and I think the invasion of the
Southern border is perfectly legitimate
because that would that would uh suggest
treasonous behavior and if treasonous
Behavior here let's say Insurrection in
particular is the reason for taking
Trump off the ballot and it doesn't have
to be proven in a court so they don't
require a court to say it's treason just
the judge can say yeah it looks
treasonist you know in my opinion
without evidence so I'm going to say it
is sure if that's the standard then
Missouri can do it too all right let's
talk about 2024 I'm going to give you my
prediction for the first time of the
2024 election outcome and I warn you
you're not going to like it you're not
going to like it but let's look at Peter
Zan's prediction I just watched that a
moment ago and he says Trump can't win
and the reason is that Republicans can
only win if they're really unified and
he's driven too many wedges in the
Republicans so you know unless they're
super unified they can't win because
they have fewer voters than Democrats um
I feel like that's a complete lack of
understanding of
Republicans doesn't this feel like
something that was said in
2016 Trump is too divisive the
Republicans won't he'll never get the um
the religious
conservatives and then once it became a
contest between Hillary and Trump
suddenly all the Republicans said oh
crap and they lined up and they voted
for Trump why wouldn't that happen again
I feel like it's just going to happen
again Trump trump will be divisive the
primaries will you know sus out all that
divisiveness among Republicans but once
they have their candidate whether it's
Trump or anybody else they're all going
to line up and I think The Independents
are not really Independents you know
they're people who always go one way you
know they just call themselves
independent so I don't agree with Peter
Zan's take on this at all I do agree
that Trump has divided the Republican
party but that's only going to last
until they get to the front door you
know as soon as they're walking through
the
election you know polling place they're
just Republicans that's that's my take
now am I wrong do am I reading the room
wrong is Peter Zan reading it right that
the Republicans
will sort of opt out or not vote because
they're not pro Trump enough of
them
yeah if he CH yeah if he chose Haley as
a VP that might be a problem but I'm
going to disagree with Peter xan I think
the Republicans will uh form up just the
way they always do I don't think it'll
be any difference this
time um s rasmason says that two-thirds
of Democrats approve of keeping Trump
off the
ballot
2third of
Republicans approve of keeping Trump off
the ballot
and I'm pretty sure that most of them
understand they're not doing it legally
in other words it's pretty obvious that
the Supreme Court will reverse it so you
can't really say that they're saying
they agree with the law because they
probably know that it's not going to
pass legal muster
eventually but still two-thirds of
Democrats are in favor of it now you
know what's scary about this if you
reverse the parties just the exact topic
you just you know changed Biden with
Trump about two-thirds of Republicans
would be in favor of keeping Biden off
the ballot for similarly stupid reasons
it's just people like to win you know I
I think people are just saying well
what's it take to win all right if that
gets it done it's so important we'll do
it but keep this in mind how many how
many Democrats are opposed to Trump even
having a fair chance of running and
where does that come from from that
doesn't come just from wanting their
candidate to win that comes from being
propagandized and brainwashed to
thinking that Trump is literally a
dictator and that yeah that he h and
that you know there there's a
existential risk that's how you get
two-thirds of the people say he can't be
on the ballot even even if he's legally
allowed
um Let me let me ask you this though
among Republicans
among Republicans what percent of
Republicans think it's perfectly fine if
he's taking off the
ballot that's right about a quarter
20 um
73% disapprove of taking him off so 100
minus 73 and you got your number yep
it's always about a quarter of the
people are
OTS um and now I give you my prediction
for 2024 the presidential election this
will be the first time I've made this
prediction my prediction is that when
the votes are counted we will not have a
president or we'll have two but we will
not have a result and I don't mean that
the result will be delayed I mean that
the result will be thrown
out and that the Supreme Court will
order a
doover whether it's the Supreme Court or
we just just decide to do it but uh my
prediction is this that if you simply
counted the votes I think Trump would
win but if you look at the number of
people who would be willing to take him
off the ballot whether that's legal to
do or not if you look at the framing of
him as you know Hitler Etc you've
created a situation where the Democrats
have to rig the
election they don't have a
choice I would if you if I were a Dem
rat and i' been brainwashed to think I
could stop Hitler I would rig the
election in a
heartbeat for you I'd do it for you I
wouldn't even do it for myself I would
literally risk my life literally I would
risk my
life to keep Hitler out of office and if
I thought I could cheat and I had some
chance of getting away with it totally
so there is a situation that guarantees
Democrats have the incentive to cheat
now do they have the ways do they have a
mechanism is there any practical way
Democrats could cheat well yes yes there
is now is there a way to cheat massively
and get away with
it
no that's the
problem so the two things that would
cause us to have an election with no
president elected would be these two
things that are both
guaranteed with current information
they're guaranted anything can change
we're
guaranteed that Trump is a better
candidate than Biden and that if it were
you know straight up those two and we
don't know yet because people are a lot
of smart people say including me that
Biden might not make it to the end zone
but suppose he does or there's another
candidate who doesn't poll any
better and let's say that the polling
clearly says that Trump is going to
win and then then he goes ahead and
doesn't
win if you saw that the polling said he
was clearly going to win but the results
were
ridiculous and obviously
rigged I think that's where we're
heading I think R rigging is guaranteed
because the brainwashing and the priming
up to this point is guaranteed you can't
not have rigging under our current
situation does everybody agree with that
there is no reasonable way you could
have a fair election when one side
that's running the election believes
it's an existential threat to not just
their own careers or lives or livelihood
but to the planet remember they believe
that the planet will be destroyed the
planet by climate change and nuclear war
whatever if if Trump is elected they
believe he will he will uh round people
up and putting them in prison camps
right now that's just citizens that's
just what the citizens have been
brainwashed into thinking imagine what
you would think if you were a leading
Democrat and you knew that either you
had done some sketchy things that the
Republicans might catch you for and jail
you for or you really did some sketchy
things and they're going to catch you so
so either they're going to accuse you of
sketchy things which is a big problem or
you did sketchy things and they're going
to catch you which is an even bigger
problem so if you're a leader given that
all the things they doing against Trump
and Trump is saying directly you elect
me and I'm going to give Vengeance I'm
going to get revenge he's clearly stated
whether he does it or not I'm not sure
he would do it but he's clearly stated
he's going to go to try to
jail members of the democratic
party why because they're trying to jail
him so I think he's saying very clearly
if you're going to try to jail me and
you don't get me I'm going to jail you
if I can now under those
situations do you think the leading
Democrats will cause a rigged vote of
course I would you put me in that
situation where I think the incoming
president might try to put me in jail I
would rig that vote every
 day I'd be rigging it up and
down oh I wouldn't and I and I had no no
hesitation whatsoever so here's the the
most like thing is that Trump would beat
whoever he's running
against but the election will go the
other way and it will be so obviously
rigged like it'll be so an awack with
what we expect that the Supreme Court is
going to say you got to do this
again we we just have to do it again
there there's no way this can stand now
others have pointed out that well you
know in 2020 they didn't redo the
election they just decided who won not
good enough this time
because if it really was just which
votes do you count you know that's like
a a small question but if it's a we
think this entire thing was rigged and
by the way we have
proof If you have proof it was rigged I
don't think the Supreme Court just gives
it to the other person I think they're
going to say the only way to hold the
country together is you just got to do
this again and you got to look you got
to watch it a little more carefully and
just do it
again so my prediction is we will not
pick a president in 2024 because we have
designed a system that guarantees we
won't remember design is Destiny we have
now designed our current system to
guarantee that it will be rigged and
guarantee that we'll notice it and
guarantee that we have to throw away the
election I think it's
guaranteed
um the Supreme Court does not settle if
no electoral vote
majority right so yeah process-wise if
if there's no
electoral uh majority then he goes to
the house Etc but I'm talking about in
the situation where rigging is um
obvious and it shown in those situations
I can't believe it goes to the
house I think the Supreme Court would
insert itself and we' want that to
happen because I don't think you'd want
a political I don't think you want a
political solution to rigging I think
you need a legal remedy to rigging
because that's a crime if it were a
political problem then
yes take it to the
house so that's my prediction my
prediction is no
result and do you think anybody else
will make that
prediction yeah do you think anybody
else will make a result that on the coin
flip it's going to land on Edge because
that's what I just did I I just
predicted that the coin flip is going to
land on the edge and stay there now if I
get this right would you
acknowledge that it's the most unlikely
prediction of all time because it's
never happened it's never
happened so for a coin flip to land on
the edge is like a
real kind of a
gutsy or crazy might be just crazy Co
all right let me tell you what's going
to happen in Gaza and the West Bank
so uh the US wants a two-state solution
the two states in this telling would be
a combined Gaza and West Bank so the
United States doesn't want Gaza to be
its own country anymore I'm sure Israel
doesn't either so the thought is that
you combine the Palestinians into one
entity um and then the the US is pushing
that the Palestinians you know ideally
somebody that can get along with Israel
uh run their own shell and that you know
you move toward a you know solid
two-state solution now that of course is
crazy that could never happen so here's
what could
happen and by the way I do agree with
blinkin and Biden talking in those terms
because they're talking in a term that
the Palestinians might want to hear as
in oh yeah we do want to have our own
place and run things we'd like to take
over Israel too but you know at least
you're not being crazy saying that we
would have a state we would we would be
in
charge
um so politically it's the right thing
to say I I would say the same thing but
realistically can't happen because
Israel's going to need control here's
how you solve it um I don't know if I've
told you I have a long background in
negotiating contracts and stuff and it's
also something you learn in business
school negotiating so here's a little
negotiating trick for you if you can't
decide how to make something work today
you change the time frame change the
time frame that's one of the big
variables that you can you can make
people agree because there's no way
you'll get people to agree on day one
there is no solution for the first year
after the war is let's say done there is
no way to agree so we either have
permanent war or you Agree to Agree
later so here's what I think is the only
way they can go make a 20-year plan for
um the fate of Gaza and the West Bank
collectively so I do agree that it needs
to be treated as one entity not Gaza as
one entity and the West Bank is a
separate one I feel like that's maybe
will be easy to make that happen
I think they have to say on year one
Israel will have complete control over
the West Bank and Gaza for police
security and
schools now whatever is happening in the
West Bank now you know make some
adjustments to that because if
something's working in the West Bank
they probably keep it uh in other words
if the Palestinian police are doing a
good job
already you maybe that's a stable
situation you you could extend to Gaza
but uh generally speaking Israel would
have the The veto over anything security
related now I think there's no way
around that for the first year Israel is
going to have to have absolute security
control as much as they can over the
area and they won't I don't think that
they would settle for anything less but
if they said our long-term goal is to
fix the education system so we're not
training a bunch of young people to be
terrorists and to eventually
uh work together productively to until
you're partners and then you can really
let the Palestinian area be free or
govern
itself so you wait your 20 20 years with
the with goals along the way that if
there are no terrorist attacks or maybe
they're limited then you could say that
the experiment succeeded and in 20 years
you've reprogrammed the kids to be
peaceful and live together and and
you've reduced the number of Terror
attacks to small or nothing and then you
say all right let's rethink this 20
years is going by I think you guys can
run your own country we'll save some
money because we don't need to be your
security we'll just save some money and
let's live in peace and be
friends I suppose that could happen but
here's what more likely would happen at
the end of 20 years it would look
exactly the
same and then the Israelis say well I
guess no change I guess you can't run
your own place cuz nothing changed kids
are still being brainwashed despite our
best efforts we're still getting Terror
attacks every day despite having full
security control so it'd be worse if we
didn't um so we got to keep
it so you've got to tell the
Palestinians that you have a plan for
their independence not a plan not a plan
to own Israel but a plan for the West
Bank and Gaza you have to tell them
there's a plan and you have to let them
try to achieve it as in if you can Tamp
down your terrorism you know we will
give you all these concessions
Etc so the best case scenario is for
Israel to give the
Palestinians uh everything they ask for
but not for 20
years and then watch them fail for 20
years and then do do whatever you want
at that point because you'd have full
security control so the Israelis can
make a fake deal saying yeah if if if we
can live together for 20 years and
improve that whole time then we're
better off if you run your own place we
don't want to be there anyway and that's
a story that I think you could sell
because they could always tell well we
could stop doing some terrorism and I
think we could work that out in 20 years
so 20 years is long enough that nobody
thinks they'll be in the same job so
nobody know nobody thinks that they'll
be respons ible for the
outcomes so they can agree to things
because they won't have to pay the price
if it doesn't work so I think you're
going to have to give the Palestinians
something that's real in terms of if
they did meet these challenges they
could have their own government in their
own State uh they still be unhappy that
they don't conquer Israel but you could
work it
out so I think that's the only way it
can
go um no matter what we talk about until
then it's going to have to be a
multi-year plan it's going to have to
start with Israel having full control of
everything that can control and there
has to be some kind of metric or goal or
subgoal to change that situation over
time or else everybody will be
permanently
unhappy so there's no good
solution but the fake solution is
probably the only one they can
do so I go for a fake fake piece with a
20-year
plan um meanwhile Israel is picking off
Hezbollah leaders they've got a couple
of them in uh Lebanon and you might say
to yourself but Scott does this not mean
that Israel is going to open another
front and Hezbollah is going to be
storming over the border and attacking
Israel and the answer is apparently not
so here's the main thing you need to
know about
Hezbollah they
have tens of thousands of missiles but
they don't have an offensive Army
besides the missiles in other words they
don't they're not really even organized
as like a proper military that could
invade a country so Hezbollah is
probably not going to rush across the
border and start
attacking it would be a bad idea because
if they did then Israel would turn all
of their guns on HBO when they're done
with Gaza they would wipe them out
because they would have to they would
have enough support to do it so
Hezbollah could end its existence if
they attack but on the other hand they
have to keep doing little missile
attacks to look like they're still in
business right because their own
supporters need them to do
something so Israel has apparently
cleverly deduced that if they keep their
killings to just their
leaders and Hezbollah keeps their
terrorism to just
missiles that that that's a stable
situation it's
terrible but it's stable and I think
both Hezbollah and Israel would be okay
with you know HB would be okay if they
can send some missiles now and then and
Israel would be okay if they can kill
some leaders now and then but neither of
them have any interest in a ground war
so I think Ground Wars kind of
unlikely uh partly because Hezbollah
doesn't have that capability all right V
had uh warned that he might surprise in
Iowa and the caucuses and we were
wondering why does he think
that because the polling does not show
that but uh there are a couple things
going on that look good one is he he's
done
239
events which is more than the other
three uh combined so if you take uh
Trump DeSantis and Haley all of their
events combined in Iowa are
174 but aake by himself has done
239 now he's also focusing on colleges
and young people including free
beer he's got like a free beer thing
where uh if if the college kids come and
listen to him he'll he'll pay for their
beer tab so that's
fun so he does seem to have a strong
following among the young who are you
know less likely to get to out in caucus
but maybe this time you can get them to
do it I think the worse the weather is
the you know the less the young people
are going to come out but so can for
vake surprise can he surprised by doing
more events and by apparently most of
his sporters are
male no surprise there so most of his
sporters are young and male at least at
the colleges they're mostly
male no
surprise but uh as I've said many
times if America is to be
saved who's going to do
it you know who
right it's going to be the same people
will do it every time if America is to
be saved it'll be young
men young men will say this and
they'll just start overturning all the
tables right you can always depend on
young men to break anything that needs
to get broken if you want to fix
something or you want to build something
you know not every young man is good at
that you know some Steve Jobs and Bill
Gates are but generally your average
young man is better breaking but if you
need if you've got a system that's not
working and you need it
broken call the young
people yeah get your your Hamiltons and
your Jeffersons and stuff yeah on the
younger
side so I do think that maybe v may have
a
secret hidden card here which is a lot
of young men if he can get them
mobilized mobilizing them is a hard part
but they seem to like him whether they
show up in caucus is a separate
question but we'll
see
so
um that ladies and gentlemen is my
excellent live stream for today
um I don't think anybody will match my
presidential
prediction but there it is and um I'm
seeing I'm seeing indications that Trump
is going to flat out win the Hispanic
vote do you think so do you believe the
polling that says that Trump would not
just do better than normal but would
flat out win the Hispanic
vote I'm going to say I don't believe
that I don't believe that but I think
you'll do Better Than People
expect now what about the black vote you
know the polls are showing that he still
lose the black vote but he would close
he would close the gap more than any
Republican ever closed the Gap that part
I believe I do believe he's going to be
have the best black
support uh of any
Republican
um yeah of black men right I think black
women will be solidly Biden and oh okay
I'm good do you think that Trump will
win more than half of black
men I don't know about that I'm not sure
I would make that bet but he'll do
better than people
expect all right yeah I believe well men
in general don't like weak men women in
general usually don't like weak men
unless they're afraid of the strong one
and I think Trump is scary by his
Persona all right oh yeah I saw so this
is funny uh so cartoonist Ben Garrison
who's my Nemesis he started with his
cartoons he started a bunch of fake news
about me and
vaccines but he didn't know it I don't
think he knew it but he used the
dementia Hitler uh meme that I created
and made a cartoon around it and I think
then people immediately said hey you're
using Scott Adams's meme in your cartoon
which is
funny all
right
um Fanny Willis is the poor woman's
comble
harir yeah uh Greg geld mentioned
dementia Hitler yesterday on the show so
it's not trending but I think we can get
it trending again all right thanks for
joining everybody uh
YouTube and Rumble and uh
xplatform see you
tomorrow
