well if you're here and I'm here must be
time for something you know what I
[Music]
mean good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
it's the best thing best time you'll
ever have in your life but if you'd like
to take this experience up to levels
that nobody can even understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need is a cuper muger glass a tanker
cheler Stein a canteen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine here the day the thing that
makes everything better little oxytocin
extra today it's called the simultaneous
Sip and it happens now
oh my goodness so
good so so
good well let's start with some science
and we'll get to the politics and today
I will give you my official prediction
for the
election you're going to want to hear
that because you
know anyway so according to s poost u
there was a study that says uh if you
have a habit of suppressing positive
emotions it could lead to lower
well-being let me see if I can put this
in my own words uh if you refuse to act
happy you will be more
sad okay again could have saved a little
bit of time and money just by asking me
hey Scott do you think that acting happy
could be good for your mental health and
I would say you mean when things are
going well yeah when things are going
well if you act happy and enjoy it will
that be good for your mental health I'd
say let me think about
that uh uh yes yes it would save your
money on that study you don't need it
that's what I would have
said in other news study finds which I
guess is a site of some kind uh there's
a social Crisis 4 in 10 people
um I think it's Americans haven't made
new friends in over a year how many of
you have made a new friend in the past
year do you make a new friend most
years what do normal people do I don't
know because I'm not a normal person do
most of you make new friends every
year I'm quite impressed if you do you
do all right all right well those of you
who make those of you who make new
friends every
year my hat is off to
you good job on that but uh more on this
survey uh more than a third of Americans
37% say their their social life is stuck
in a
rut and and uh it's been at least a year
for many it's been at least a year since
they've gone to a concert so 59% of the
respondents
said it's been at least a year since
they've gone to a concert with a
friend how many of you even go to
concerts with
friends and of the entire public what
percentage of them ever go to a
concert if if 60% of them have not gone
to one in a year let's say 40% have
isn't 40% a lot of people to have gone
to a concert in one year like even
one I don't understand this poll at all
and then it says uh and 44 uh have not
been on a vacation with friends in a
year how often do you go on vacation
with
friends is that something normal people
do I have I have been on vacation with
friends it's something that's happened
and I enjoyed it it was great but it's
not the main way people go on vacation
is
it any anyway um I have a uh I have a
theory that the reason people are doing
less stuff and going to fewer parties is
there's less drinking people people who
don't drink don't really enjoy parties
the same as people who drink enjoy
parties so if if you were to say to me
and say my
30s what would you think of the idea of
seeing a bunch of people you know in
your demographic group uh not racial but
you know let's say same socioeconomic
group and uh same age is and you're all
going to have some drinks and eat some
good food I would say to myself that's
like as good as it gets I can't wait for
that now all you do is take the alcohol
end of the equation all right you're
going to meet with some people you love
and you can eat some good food and
you're going to drink some
water it's not nearly the
same you know pretty much the drinking
was the
organizing focus of the Gathering so you
know you still like the people just as
much but the
event maybe you'd rather go to the
gym well according to RFK Jr fluoride in
our water is so dangerous that uh if he
were to come into any Authority with the
Trump Administration should he get
elected Trump uh that uh very soon after
that they would advise all us Water
Systems to remove fluoride from the
public water
apparently U fluoride is according to
RFK Junior an industrial waste
associated with arthritis bone fractures
bone cancer IQ loss neurodevelopment
disorders and thyroid
disease I think I have most of those so
it's the water so people whatever you do
do not drink the water from your town
that's got the fluoride what you want to
do instead is drink the water that's put
in those plastic bottles that um the
plastic bottles okay don't drink
anything out of plastic because that
will get you the microplastics that will
stay in your body and your balls will be
full of plastic so don't drink any water
that comes from your
TAP uh but also from a water
bottle if it's raining I wouldn't open
my mouth and look up cuz I don't know
what's in the ution of that
rain
um now I feel like I should be
recommending something here but every
now and then you'll see a dirty
puddle I recommend sticking your face in
it and
going and just drink up that dirty Brown
puddle CU it's not going to be perfectly
healthy but it's as good as the other
water you have it is but you might be
delighted to know there's a
revolutionary new water Harvester that
uh is one of these devices I've told you
about these before that extract uh water
from the air but according to Ohio State
University they've made it much more
efficient so it'll use way less
energy um I literally bought one of
these I it's still in the box I haven't
opened it but I bought a water generator
I'm sorry a power generator that could
work on
solar and I bought a thing that will
turn air into water
because I feel like I need to make my
own water at least the drinkable stuff
and I don't know any other way to do it
where do you get your water if it's not
in
plastic or out of the
tap it's the only two places I can get
water and they're both apparently going
to kill me so I'm going to make my own
water out of the air and then it'll take
me about six months before somebody will
say whatever do don't use one of those
machines that sucks the water into of
the air because the filters are all
corroded that I'm making that up that's
not true but sooner or later somebody's
going to say that that water will kill
you too so if there's anything I can
tell you I'm not a doctor but you should
never drink liquids for the rest of your
life well maybe that's why I'm not a
doctor you'll be dead in the week if you
take my advice don't take my
advice all right here now my 2024
election prediction this is the official
one this is the one I will not be able
to wiggle out of there will be no
weaseling I am committed I am nailed
down to this following
prediction and I'll will read it exactly
as I wrote it on the
xplatform I predict a
landslide of election rigging
claims that's right there will be so
many claims of rigging on this election
uh and more than the courts handle
before January 6 which allegedly is when
we would certify the election so what's
going to happen if we have a landslide
of election irregularity
claims as you know the vast majority of
them will
be not real ones in other words some
people will think they saw something but
maybe it wasn't what they thought they
saw however since there will be a
landslide of claims and already It's
Beginning by the way we'll get to that
uh you can be sure that some of them
will look at least on the surface like
they could be quite credible in other
words it'll be people who have signed
things under penalty of you know law you
know they'll sign something um legally
there'll be multiple witnesses to some
things in some cases they'll have a a
ballot in their hand that literally is
obviously fake those are the
cases where we're not going to be able
to have an answer about what's going on
before the election has to be certified
so what do you do if you had a few
little claims the courts have the the
luxury of saying well even if we were to
take this case it wouldn't change the
outcome of the election so why don't we
just let it go but what if it's an
avalanche of
claims and there are enough of them that
look credible and of scale
that you couldn't possibly know who won
unless you figured
out whether the claims were real what do
you do
then well here's the rest of my
prediction I predict that Trump will get
most of the real votes but Democrats
will empty the trickster Vault to keep
him from being certified and taking
office on schedule in other words I
don't know what the
official count will be but I think that
in the real world Trump will get the
most votes that's that's my prediction
we might not ever know that because I
don't know that we have a system that
can tell us who got how many
votes um I predict that massive voter
fraud will be discovered and it will
confirm in the minds of the public that
Trump was probably right about 2020
being rigged in other words if there is
a largescale cheat that is
discovered and maybe it already has been
this is a a little bit of a tease for
what what is to come uh then people are
going to quite reasonably assume correct
or not correct they will assume that
Trump was right about 2020 because do
you think that there could be a massive
voter cheat in
2024 and there wasn't one in 2020 would
anybody believe that right now we have
not discovered one in
2024 that that has not been
confirmed but if it did and this is my
prediction my prediction is that it will
it's going to make you thing 2020 look
different than maybe you thought unless
you already thought it was
corrupt anyway so the tricksters will
come out they will try to keep Trump
from taking office um and uh I think
that by the time that uh we discover the
fraud which I think we will I feel like
Trump will eventually maybe the Supreme
Court will get into it but maybe it's
the House of Representatives depending
on the claims but I think Trump will
ultimately take office uh maybe by the
end of January is I think that we will
miss our deadlines I don't think January
6 or January 20th will necessarily be
the certification and then the swearing
in but we won't be too far off because
the the more we miss those deadlines the
more critical it'll be to you know get
get something done so I think Trump will
take office and I think the golden age
will
begin but not without a fight now when I
say fight I do not mean
physical I believe that uh we've got
several weeks of some real serious legal
maneuvering we don't know who will win
that for sure so when I make my
prediction of course nothing is binary
you know it's it's all uh based on risk
assessment and my best
guess I think that everything depends on
whether there's a big enough cheat that
gets
caught before something gets
certified and I think the odds of
catching it are now above
50% so in past elections I don't think
either side was trying hard enough to
catch any
rigging this time they're trying hard
this time the Republicans are putting
something like 100% effort into looking
for a cheat if they don't find one I'd
be kind of
surprised I think we'd all be surprised
if they don't find one but we'll see U
more on that so KL Harris went on SNL
and it was just the cringiest thing with
Maya Rudolph pretending they were
looking in the mirror except kamla since
she was doing a comedy routine on a
comedy show and she's the cackler and
chief uh may I give you my impression of
90% of everything come Li did on camera
are you
[Music]
ready and then sometimes a little bit of
on top of it I think I nailed it nailed
it
so if uh if that got her any votes I'd
be pretty surprised because she did look
like she she she look like the bus that
she loves is a short one is that's all
I'm going to
say anyway according to Brendan car uh
uh FCC commissioner
um she may have broken the law because
there's a sort of an equal opportunity
thing on TV that if you give somebody
time on TV the other one has to have
equal time but by waiting for the last
minute before the election when Trump
couldn't possibly schedule his own time
on there they may have found a way to
skirt the rule and break the law so she
should be in
jail no not really I do not believe in
the law pring the candidate 2 days
before the
election but I would note that it does
look like a technical violation of the
law
now um I'm not in favor of lawfare so I
don't think somebody who made a small
technical violation of the law that
won't move a single
vote should be prosecuted two days
before the election and but I wish the
same standard were used for Trump
because I don't know if you're ready for
this
but one possibility is that Trump loses
the election and goes to
jail you know that's actually a
possibility
right that he could lose the election
and just go to jail like within a month
now I don't know how the appeals would
work maybe stuff would be stretched
down I don't think that's going to
happen uh I put a strong bet against it
but it's possible now you know how I
keep saying that you know the country is
not going to get violent and you know
we'll work it out I don't think that
applies if Trump goes to
jail if if the election didn't look
proper and Trump not only lost an
election that didn't look proper but he
also got put in jail in a process that
didn't look proper I think violence
would be guaranteed at that point now I
don't recommend it I'm just saying if
you're going to predict it that would be
a line too far for some degree age some
number of people some some number of
people I think would become violent at
that point so I hope that doesn't happen
because that would be the worst case
scenario do not become
violent all right according to the
federal list uh there's a new uh Inside
Story an investigation of how Reddit has
been totally manipulated by the commonly
Harris campaign so apparently they have
this big network of fake Reddit users
who pretend their regular users to uh to
rig
Reddit so as far as we
know I have no proof that the election
is rigged so I want to say that clearly
I have no proof that the coming election
is rigged or that any past one has ever
been rigged no proof at all we do have
strong evidence that the media is
rigged we know that the intelligence
outfits are
rigged we know that Reddit is rigged
Facebook was
rigged um and uh basically everything
that's outside of the government is
rigged so if the election is not rigged
it would be the only
thing so so I love the fact that people
don't want to deal with the the the
obvious truth that everything we can
check is rigged so if you said to me
Scott we're going to do an investigation
going to look at Reddit going to find
out if there's anybody on the Democrat
side who's doing any you know skevy
things on Reddit I would have said well
I'll save you some money yes they
are because they can and it doesn't seem
to be illegal in any standard way or at
least if it was it' be maybe a fine or
something so of course they are of
course they are so the media rigged for
sure obviously I I don't even have to
make a case for that you all know that
the social media is rigged obviously you
know X is the exception I
hope I mean who knows maybe maybe even
deep in the bowels of X there might be
some shenanigans that uh even Elon
doesn't know about maybe it's
possible meanwhile Jimmy Kimmel's taking
some heat because uh he made a joke
about um when you should vote and he
said that you should vote on Tuesday
unless you're a trump supporter and then
you should vote on Wednesday or Thursday
which of course is not a time you can
vote and your vote would not count so
that's why it's a joke it's a joke
because everybody knows that you're not
allowed to vote after the
election except I don't know if
everybody does know
that I'm not sure everybody knows that
so do do you remember when uh who was it
Douglas Mackey did a meme for the 20 uh
16 election and went to jail because it
suggested uh that you could vote by text
and uh that would be incorrect so it's
illegal to send out election related
information that's
inaccurate now Douglas Mackey did it as
a joke
and Jimmy Kimmel did it as a
joke one of them went to
jail and one of them just had a nice
day should they be treated the
same
well here's the thing I think it does
matter how obviously it's a joke I think
that Jimmy Kimmel won in my opinion
qualifies as obviously a joke so no
problem but we also have to be
consistent right so it's not just enough
that one of them gets away with
something they have you have to treat
them the same I I looked at the Douglas
Mackey thing and I said to myself oh
below a certain IQ that might actually
make you think you voted a different
time or a different
way so I think maybe the problem was
that Douglas Mackey was just 10% short
of being obvious in both cases they were
jokes so I don't think either should be
um I I think both of them should be uh
you know Free Speech free
people but at least you can see there's
some difference you know dumb people
wouldn't have known the difference with
the Macky one I I don't know if any dumb
people would have been convinced by
Jimmy Kimmel though so there's a small
difference but not enough that I would
have treated them differently are we
okay with that are you okay if I do say
there's a small difference but it's not
a small difference I would say is
important in a legal sense if both of
them intended to say a joke if the vast
majority of people who saw it took it as
a joke that's good enough for me I don't
need to know that some dumb people were
fooled by it that's you know Free Speech
has got to let you do that
so um I saw that was it Matt Walsh was
making the case that uh Kimmel should be
put in jail and he said I'm dead serious
when I say if Trump wins he should do
that now I get what you're saying Matt
Walsh I don't think they're saying that
before the election was your best
play
cuz you don't want to start saying
you're going to lock up your enemies
right before the
election and first of all we're
not let's say this clearly I I get what
Matt Walsh is saying I totally
understand the point you know that you
should treat treat things equally and it
would
certainly you know send a
message but no you don't say this a day
before the
election or the week before the election
you know even if you're thinking it
maybe keep that one to yourself and by
the way I wouldn't I wouldn't be in
favor of putting Jimmy Kimmel in jail I
would be in favor of Douglas
Mackey being pardoned or whatever it
takes to make him a free man is he
already free he's out right is Douglas
Mackey already out you think he
is hope
so um well there was a big story
yesterday that uh if you don't mind I'm
going to skip and it involves a squirrel
and a raccoon and I just like animals
too much you know there there was
something funny about the story but also
something just horrible about it so if
you don't mind you're going to see
plenty of it all over the place today so
with your permission we're going to skip
that story today it's one of the biggest
stories but I I can't handle pad stuff
it's just I don't want it in my head do
you know why the very first thing I I
wrote about was if you have positive
thoughts in your head you're going to be
happier
anyway um I'll just say that the person
responsible was a Dei hired named Karen
and then we'll move on that's actually
true by the way um Harrison Ford did a
weird uh black and white video
endorsement of Harris and honestly when
I look at it I can't tell if it's
brainwashing stupidity or
blackmail but there's something
wrong there's just something wrong with
it I don't know what it is and the
reason is that when you hear him talk it
doesn't even sound like it would be
something he would
say maybe it's my bias could be entirely
happening in my head but when I look at
it it just looks weird there's just
something wrong with it I don't know and
and you know of course people are joking
does he have a connection to Diddy or
Epstein or is he being blackmailed
somehow I don't know it doesn't look
right Mark Ruffalo apparently also being
uh endorsing Harris apparently said this
quote she's got black woman
wisdom
okay she's got black W woman wisdom no I
think black women have
wisdom
but is that is that something you should
say about who you're voting
for I think a lot of people have
wisdom but is there a special kind
called black woman
wisdom that's a weird thing thing to say
so all every time one of these
celebrities endorses Harris it all looks
weird it just every every part of that
is just cringy
weird well according to slay news I
think you've already heard this there's
a Democrat group in Arizona under
investigation for making fraudulent uh
voter applications I guess so uh
fraudulent voter registration forms and
mail and ballot applications
and a Pennsylvania prosecutor is
investigating this is according to slay
news roughly 30 voter applications that
were identified as
fraudulent now those are voter
applications do you think that anybody
sits down and says Ah I'll tell you what
you're going to do we're going to win
this thing by making 30 voter
applications that are
fake no they do not
if if you saw one or two you might say
oh this is somebody who's trying to vote
twice I'm sure that's happened if you
see uh 10,000 come through you say oh
there's somebody trying to steal their
race but what if you have
30 nobody does
30 so if you can rule out one in other
words it wasn't a family who just made
one and you know one or two to get a
couple extra
votes is probably
30,000 or 10,000 or a thousand nobody
does 30 fake anything am I right you do
one or two if you wanted to really fly
under the radar and you would do a
thousand if you really wanted to affect
the election but there is no scenario in
which you do 30 because there's a good
chance of getting caught and no chance
of changing the election result it's not
going to be within
30 so the fact that they found
30 doesn't that almost guarantee massive
fraud at least in this one key area that
is probably the most important
one well I think so here's my next
question how did they catch
them wouldn't you like to know more
about how they caught 30 fake
ones because if they only CAU
30 what is their process that didn't let
them catch more because do any of you
think there were only 30 so is it
possible that there were
100,000 and their process only allowed
them to catch 30 and it was only by
chance I don't know so I'm a citizen of
the United
States uh I'm told that the election
will be fair and well-managed and and
that my fate will depend on
it but nobody can even describe to me
like a coherent explanation of how we
could possibly have a fair race anything
that sounded even
possibly feasible that we could have a
fair election I've not heard anything
like that I don't even know anybody who
could even describe the election process
in every state because they're all
different yeah do you think there's
anybody well here's something I said on
social media the other day you know I
like to do the dog not barking
stories so the dog not barking is from
um Sherlock Holmes stories and it has to
do with the thing that should be there
that isn't because sometimes you don't
look for the thing that isn't there you
notice something that's there but maybe
you forget to look for the thing that
should be there that isn't there so
here's something that should be there
that isn't there you ready for this
watch your head explode when I tell you
what watch when you say to yourself holy
 that should have been there you
ready for this there is massive
questions about the credibility of our
election upcoming it's the biggest
question because 2020 if if that was in
fact a good election and in fact Trump
knew it say his enemies and in fact they
acted like it was fake well then he
would be disqualified
even I would say that if I believe that
a set of facts um so it's the biggest
question right would you agree it's just
the biggest question right now it's the
most important and biggest question in
the country all right so what's
missing do you see it
yet all the TV shows all the news
programs all the podcasts you've been
watching about politics what's
missing well what's missing is that one
expert who can come on and say I know
you're all worried about the election
but let me explain how it's so well
audited that even if somebody tried to
cheat they couldn't get get away with
more than say 30 fakes because we'd
catch it and that wouldn't be enough to
check change the
election and then I would say okay okay
but what about if somebody tried this
and then the expert would say aha of
course we thought about that so here's
the safeguards we have against that and
I'd say okay okay that sounds good but
what
if somebody tried to to uh print their
own ballots would you catch that well
yes we would catch it in every single
state and we'd catch it right away and
here's how and then I'd say oh okay well
I wish I'd known that before that's
actually good to know and then I say
suppose but suppose the post office um
threw away some some ballots because
they knew that it was probably Trump
country how would you check that would
you catch that and then the expert would
say oh yeah we we'd catch that right
away because people would do this or
that and then we'd catch it and then
after everything that I suspected such
as I'd say how would you catch it if a
state actor you know somebody like a
major country hacked into any of the
machines and they'd say oh Scott
you're you're so cute that you think
that we wouldn't catch that that's that
we'd catch that obviously no no they
couldn't possibly hack into the machine
and change the vote in a way we wouldn't
notice five different ways so don't
worry Scott and all the other people
watching this because this election even
though it's different processes and
different people managing it in all
kinds of different states and and
precincts all of them are using a set of
Hardcore really Sol
security processes that have been honed
over the years and you don't have to
worry about it at all so do you all
remember seeing that
interview you all remember that right
you saw it on NBC and CBS and CNN and
MSNBC and Fox News and and breit Bart
handled it and um I'm pretty sure it was
on the AP and Reuters uh the Atlantic
probably had a big piece on it Politico
I'm sure the hill did you see see the
hill cover it no you didn't see
it you didn't see it because
there's nobody in the whole
country who is even willing to go on tv
anywhere and say yeah I can guarantee
these elections are good because I
understand the whole system and there's
no way to cheat it not one
 person in the whole
country
none not you can't even get anybody to
lie about it think about all the Liars
who have lied about everything about the
election so far they've lied about
everything just everything they've lied
about there's not a single topic that
that people you know like public figures
didn't get in front of a camera look
right into it and you knew they were
lying and they still moved their mouth
and they still told you the LIE looking
right in the camera so you know there's
no lie there's no lie big enough or
small enough
that they won't tell right in front of
your
eyes except this one it's the only lie
they won't
tell how many of you noticed before I
just brought it up that nobody had ever
had an election expert on to answer
questions and explain how any kind of
fraud that was significant would be
instantly caught
did any of you even think of it that's
how you know you're
brainwashed even if you think you're
immune from it none of us are immune I'm
not immune definitely not immune
nobody's immune if you had not once
considered that no expert has ever come
on any show you've ever seen ever to say
that the system is
secure and you never
noticed that's
brainwashing how could you not notice
that right how did I not notice it how
did I not notice it until
recently seriously how did I not notice
that there's only one one way I'm
brainwashed there can't be any other
explanation because common sense it
would be the first thing you
would bring up the first thing was can I
see to can can I talk to an expert to
see if there's any vulnerabilities here
not once
not
once
unbelievable and so that allows us to
listen to claims about the election that
are so big that you almost it blows your
mind uh Patrick burn has a uh take on
the Michigan
Shenanigans uh and he tells us this now
again this is not something I can
confirm so I don't put this forth as a
fact because I know I will give sued if
I did I put this forth as a claim by a
public figure who has looked into it so
I haven't looked into it but Patrick
burn has now I've also told you that you
should
assume 99% of every election
irregularity claim will be
false almost all of them will be
false but that doesn't mean they're all
false it just means that most of them
will be so what do I think of the
Patrick burn claim honestly I can't get
traction on it one way or the other in
other words there's nothing about it
that makes me want to reject it at a
hand but there's also nothing about it
that I could
confirm so it's such a big claim that I
don't want to embrace it because I don't
have a factual basis for it but I also
have no reason to reject it it does
sound a little Kraken likee though so so
I've got a little warning thing in the
back of my head that says uh be careful
with this one be careful with this one
but I'll just tell you what it
is the claim goes something like this
that in
Michigan uh that they had a
glitch uh in the machines some of the
ballot counting machines I guess and uh
that required a uh a software
patch so the software patch would happen
just before the election or during the
election if it's already started early
and the software software patch could
not possibly be checked for security
because there wouldn't be enough time
and too many
machines so what Patrick burn says
is uh the patch is the rig that the way
they do it is they they make sure
they've got secure they've got software
on there that looks completely secure
and legitimate uh there's a security
check everybody says that looks good and
then oh there was a
glitch and then to fix the glitch they
need a little software patch and then
according to Patrick burn the software
patch would include a virtual machine
basically a com a software emulated
computer within a
computer it does its uh bad work of
changing the vote count and then deletes
itself so that there's no evidence that
there was any malicious code in the
first place now could a state actor do
something of that
complexity I think so is there a
security expert who could tell me this
could never happen because this and this
and this are
true um I'd like to see that uh will
that be on the Joe Rogan podcast
sometime soon uh is MSNBC G to have
somebody on to talk about how Patrick
burn is totally wrong because there is
no way that a last minute software patch
could cause a malicious uh outcome that
you wouldn't catch right
away here's the problem I can't rule
this in but I can't rule it
out how do I have an election where I
can't rule this
out how am I supposed to believe this is
credible so we've got 30 fake um
applications or ballots I guess we've
we've
got last minute software patches that
look exactly like what you would do if
you were going to rig
something and
uh let's see we've got uh there's a
fourth Pennsylvania county launching
investigation into 1500 suspected
registrants after at least 600 were
found to be complete garbage according
to the Gateway
pundit so apparently Pennsylvania is
just filled with irregularities already
it's probably exactly what it looks
like there's going to be an avalanche of
irregularities so if if there's one
thing you should keep in mind it it's a
rate question it's like a flow question
it's not a yes no it's a rate question
if the rate of claims of
irregularities are big enough we can't
possibly meet our deadlines for
certifying the election
and also have an answer about whether
the election is good that might be the
most important fact in the next few
months that there won't be any way to
judge the claims as true or false and
then what we won't even know if there
was an election we literally won't know
if we had an election because we won't
have any mechanism that can check it on
time and if and if somebody gets
installed before it gets checked what
happens if they check it
later what what happens if you have a
president for six months and then the
court finally gets around to say oh wow
looks like a 100,000 of these were fake
and it would change the election what do
you do
then take Trump out in
jail you know 6 months from now they
could find out that Trump should have
been the president but instead he's in
jail that's
possible that's
possible
wow anyway
uh the CEO of uh Atlas Intel um polling
which is uh traditionally I guess they
were the most accurate pollster in 2020
so they have a high high
credibility uh they say the shows Trump
leading Arizona and Nevada by
comfortable margins and also leading in
all of the seven swing States in general
by lesser margins within the within the
margin of error in other
cases um so that's the most most
reliable one uh also in the top five
reliable ones rasmason and the head of
rasmason it says the head pollster says
uh there could be a trump Landslide
similar to the 1980 Reagan Carter
election so Bray bar news is writing
about
that so two of the
most
um credible and influential pollsters in
my
opinion say it looks like it's the Trump
election but do we have any polls that
disagree of course we
do there's an an Selzer poll that shows
that Harris is leading in Iowa which
would be a ridiculous result according
to other polls so people think it's a
fake poll just to Hell
Paris um and then what about the NBC
poll well here's the thing NBC widely
thought to be you know a tool of the
deep State and or the Democrats uh their
final poll it's a tie
4949 come on
really
really a year ago I said that the fake
polls would say it's a
tie NPC is is certainly called out as
generally the fakest of the
news
and and they came up with the
tie the exact the exact number that I
predicted a tie I mean not the number
but the
tie now that's the sort of thing you'd
do if you were planning to rig an
election if you knew that there were
polls that showed that Trump should win
you would produce polls that say oh it's
too close to no because then your
cheating could be the smallest possible
cheating and get you over the line or or
at least you could win by a tiny Marg
and you could say well this is
compatible with the poles look at the
poles the PO said it was a tie one of
them was going to win by a tiny margin
it just happened to be commis so
everything's fine now I'm not going to
say that these polls that look fake to
me are fake because I don't know that
they just look fake they're also exactly
what you would expect if the fix was in
you'd expect these fake bows to look
exactly like this
that's what you'd
expect you would also
expect um lots of changes being happened
at the last minute for example four
Georgia counties decide at the last
minute to accept ballots over the
weekend in violation of the law this is
gayway pundit again
so uh oh but that I think that changed
now so following our pressure campaign
our pole Watchers have been let back in
according to Michael Watley RNC chair so
not only were the four Georgia counties
going to count votes after the deadline
which is illegal they were going to kick
out the Republican pole Watchers which
is also
illegal now is it clear and obvious to
you that they were planning to rig the
election there's no proof but if they
were it would look exactly like this it
would look like you know
we need to do some extra counting and
the extra counting will be uh of these
suspicious after the deadline things and
uh by the way we're not going to let the
Republicans watch when we do the extra
counting after the
deadline now what else would that be
what what is the other what is the other
possibility every signal every signal is
screaming that they're planning to rig
this thing it's just screaming signals
doesn't mean it will
happen doesn't mean they will but the
signals are just screaming at this
point all right what else
um Politico all right here's here's what
else you would expect you would expect
that one of the friendly Publications to
the Democrats would write an article
saying that the polls might be wrong and
that really KL Harris was probably had
the whole time
sure enough Politico has an article why
the polls might be wrong in Kam Harris's
favor really now remember what I tell
you that if you know what happened you
don't know anything if you know who is
involved you know everything so the
first thing I say to myself is who would
write this article so it was written by
Justin Brown I don't know Justin Brown
so I looked at his bio that was included
at the bottom of the article and uh says
he uh works as a newsroom analyst so he
helps various digital Publications and
the other ones are the Atlantic oh there
we
go if you see somebody as any
association with the
Atlantic the Atlantic is the number one
most you know non well the most fake
news of the fake news so it's the number
one fakest of the fake Democrat
news National Journal and Vox I don't
know National Journal but I'm guessing
that if Vox on the Atlantic and Politico
are part of who this Justin Brown works
for that that might be a little tip off
of what his political preferences are
and sure enough there's an article that
uh gives you some doubt that the most
that the most accurate
posters might be wrong this time huh huh
we didn't see this until now just in
time for it to be part of the
conversation um meanwhile a federal
judge in Arizona ruled that uh election
officials uh must hand over 1.2 million
records of unknown voters in the state's
2024
election um
situation so here's what could happen
there are 1.2 million quote unknown
voters they're on the
roles that could be enough if somebody
in Arizona had planned a cheat that
involved using the names that are the
unknowns you know in other words voting
for those names without those names
knowing that any votes had happened
maybe they're dead maybe they moved down
state um it could be that the CH already
happened somebody already mailed in a
bunch of votes for the people on the
unknown
list but now the good guys have the
list so the good guys can fairly quickly
I think if they have the right authority
to do so uh check the actual votes
against the unknowns and find out if the
big Gat happened in
Arizona h what do you think about that
so we may have a possibility where the
door is already open for full visibility
to one form of cheating if in fact that
form of cheating happened the real
problem is that the cheating happens and
there's no way to catch it but this
would suggest that cheating that's
already happened meaning that probably
the mail and votes already got filled
out and then after the cheating happened
allegedly this is just speculative um
the good guys could get access to the
list in time to do something before
January 6 what would happen if the
election was
uh off by one state let's say that one
state was difference and col Harris one
at all and it's because Arizona went her
way and nobody expected
it
well this could be the third act this
could be the big thing that gets caught
so it could be a whistleblower that
comes forward that'd be fun could be
something like
this anyway
what other what other skull dugery and
shenanigans should we expect well both
the Jonathan turle and Joel Pollock uh
agreed with a take that I had on some
legal stuff which is a big deal to me
because I'm just guessing when I look at
the legal stuff but if two people who
are uh both uh lawyers agree with me
then I I feel like I'm being Smarter on
the point all right here's the point
I mentioned it before but now now you
know that smart people agree with me so
it's it's a different point I'm just
bolstering something I mentioned before
but on Bill Mah's show on HBO you
already know that Jamie Raskin uh was
asked if he would accept a trump win and
he said he would only if it's a free and
fair election so basically he took the
same approach As Trump and the same
approach that he led the impeachment of
trump for so in public
with complete Clarity the person who led
the impeachment against Trump for
doubting an
election says he would do the same thing
in the same situation and plans to so
he'll accept it if it looks good and I
think Trump would have too and he will
reject it if it looks obviously rigged
which of course he
should as anybody
should and how in the world
are we just sitting there and watching
that
happen how in the world is that that the
biggest story in the
country it's because the Democrats
control the media so there won't be one
mention of this in any of the
traditional media I'll bet you're not
going to see it on NBC or CBS or ABC or
you're not going to see it in roers
you're not going to see it in the AP
you're not going to see it on MSNBC CNN
right
and how much bigger of a story could it
be than the person who led the
impeachment says in public as clear as
day that he'd do the same thing and the
reason that they can get away with this
brainwashing is because they made you
think past the sale for four
years think past the sale the sale is
was the 2020 election
rigged if it was rigged everything that
Trump did is exactly what you'd want
your leader to do question it try to get
it
fixed
right but but the uh the brainwashing
media start you after the first question
the first question hasn't been answered
was it rigged we don't really have a way
to know and like I said no news PL
platform has put an expert on who could
be questioned to find out if the public
could know if an election had been
rigged
right so they tell you it was definitely
not rigged but they'll never put on
anybody to back up that claim just
people just say it's not rigged that's
means
nothing and they're not going to cover
the fact that the guy who led the
impeachment is going to says in public
he says it
clearly that under the same situation
that he believed As Trump believed the
election was rigged that he'd do the
same thing
there is no bigger story in the country
and it won't even be
covered but Jonathan Turley he's
independent so he can cover it I can
mention it because I'm independent Joel
poock can mention it because breit bar
covers the actual news you know they
don't have to make stuff up so the only
place you'll even see this story is a
place where no Democrat ever dares go so
they just hit it completely hidden
unbelievable to me that signals that no
matter who wins the vote the Democrats
are planning to install their own
candidate one way or
another uh New York Governor Kathy hok
called the people who vote for
Republicans
anti-American you actually said that in
public the voting for the Republicans is
anti-American because the America the
Republicans don't want to do like
freedom and
stuff now that is such weird weird
gaslighting like no matter what you want
to say about the preferences of
Republicans Or democrats it's pretty
hard to say that the Republicans are
against everything they're for it be
this is like saying that Peta is in
favor of eating
animals no no Peta they're Peta they're
the saving animal people now Republicans
are
anti-American no no Republicans are the
pro Constitution pro- flag people Pro
get the government out of my pants
business but not according to the
governor of New York now these are the
ways that they soften up the country so
that if they have to jail some more
Americans for protesting the next
election they've got this predicate that
well these are unamericans these are
these are anti-americans we're putting
in
jail every signal is screaming that the
rig is
planned I don't have I have no facts
that is planned but every signal is
screaming they're laying the predicate
that all the news is conforming to
exactly the messaging you would have if
you plan to steal an election now by the
way I don't think it's organized so I do
not believe that in a RICO like fashion
all these entities are talking to each
other I don't believe for example that
Kathy hok knows anything about anything
happening with the votes in Pennsylvania
right so it seems to me it's just people
who know what to do because they all
think they're fighting Hiller so they're
doing what they can do so if you can
cheat to be Hitler you do it if you can
say some messages that'll lay the
groundwork for being Hitler you do it if
you can make a fake poll that maybe will
you know get more funding for the anti
Hitler person you do it so they don't
have to be coordinated they just all
have to know that they're all helping to
get rid of Hitler and then they just do
the run things some of it I mean some
could be coordinated but not
much
um Joe Biden said Rec in a some public
event uh that uh Republicans like Donald
Trump are the type of guys you'd like to
smack in the
ass he said but I'm serious ious these
are the kind of guys you'd like to smack
in the
ass he is so
gone it it's again it's
unbelievable that Democrats would tell
you that that he's okay in the job
that's fine that's fine just leave him
in the
job anyway
um I've got a question for you
um I need a legal take on this suppose
the Constitution has deadlines for
certification and also the swearing in
January 20th I think what happens if
there's just events in the world that
prevent those things from happening just
nobody wants it to be prevented but
let's say there's a i natural disaster
let's say there let's let's pick that
let's say natural disaster so let's say
the deadline for the new president goes
by and and everybody's satisfied that we
couldn't have a process to pick a new
one so we're like Oh shoot what do you
do who exactly is leading the country
after January 20th if the process broke
down in a way that the entire country
would agree okay we can't just do
business as usual something
broke speak Speaker of the
House you say the speaker of the house
would become the
president
so do you but do you believe that would
happen in
reality let me give you another
scenario let's say Joe Biden steps down
before January uh in the beginning of
January so K Harris as his vice
president becomes president you know
unrelated to the election she's
president pres at the moment for at
least a few weeks once you have a new
president in January in an election year
do you think that President will ever be
removed by any kind of
process and I think the answer is it's
impossible because the whoever is the
president has too much power nobody
wants to take out the president when
they're in office because they're going
to turn it against you if it doesn't
work let's say you're in the FBI and you
say oh we should do something because we
can't have a dictator and and we didn't
have an election so we can't have her as
president do you think the head of the
FBI will stop taking directions from KLA
Harris because oh it's past January
20th I don't think so I think she would
stay in the white house if let's say she
had already moved in uh I think she
would stay there and she say I'm going
to stay here until we work it out and
then she would make sure that it never
got worked out and that would be the
Takeover so I think the strongest play
would be to put you know you know
possession is 9/10 of the law sort of
thing if there's nobody who's
President on January 20th that we just
can't decide that's not good for
anybody neither side is going to be
happy with that but if kamla goes in and
can act like well I'm the de facto
temporary emergency president know no
you know we didn't plan on this but gosh
somebody's got to be in control because
otherwise Russia might try something and
China might try to take over Taiwan if
we don't have our president so really
just for the benefit of the people I I
will stay in office just for continuity
until we work out you know our issues
about who won the election and then as
president she could slowly close down
every part of the investigation into who
won the election
and then she just becomes
president
so I think one of the strongest plays
would be putting her in without being
elected and then just trying to use the
media to keep her there and use the CIA
and all of her intelligence assets to
keep her there it's probably where it's
heading anyway
um Bannon was talking about the uh the
so-called low propensity voters that did
vote in 2020 so the the Democrats claim
that the reason that Trump lost in 2020
is that they activated so many of their
uh non-usual
voters uh but it doesn't seem like in
the polling that those non-usual voters
are willing to vote this
time do you think that if they existed
in the first place those non-typical
voters and they made the effort to vote
Trump out in
2020 that they're going to stay home in
2024 but the polling suggests I think
Richard Baris was on there with on the
War Room uh the polling suggests that
they don't
exist and Steve Bannon who is more
provocative than I am says Maybe not
maybe but he's claiming that the reason
that you can't find these low propensity
voters this year is that they never
existed
and that 2020
was rigged with uh using the low
propensity voters as fake voters in
other words somebody voted their name
but they didn't vote that would be the
accusation now I personally do not have
proof of that it is simply an election
claim
so given that uh Bannon and others think
they have an idea where the cheat comes
from it comes from people who are
possibly real voters who don't vote and
wouldn't notice if somebody voted in
their name plus maybe people who
shouldn't be on the voter roles at
all I think it means the Republicans are
going to be looking for that really hard
does it mean they can find it and it
doesn't mean that if there was a cheat
before which I don't know that they
would use the same method again so it
could be that the Republicans are
fighting the last war but this time the
machines will be rigged if they were not
last time now again I'm not saying any
machines been rigged I don't want to be
sued I have no evidence that any machine
has ever been rigged orever could be
rigged I'm just saying that if there
were cheating you could kind of move the
Nexus of where the cheating was so it's
not the same place it was last time I
mean that's what I'd
do
anyway
um in other news Israel is running out
of leaders to kill
um they claimed to kill one of hamas's
last high ranking members according to
the hill so it killed a senior Hamas
official now I'll remind you of my
hypothesis of decapitation
strikes um if he killed the top
terrorist number two is probably still
pretty good and you know there's a good
chance of number three is you know maybe
not as good as one and two but but good
enough to keep the movement going but
when you get to about the sixth person
down in the leadership stack you're
going to hit a Wall-E you know what I
mean you're going to hit a pointy haired
boss boss you're going to hit somebody
who can't keep that thing alive and my
guess is that by the time you get down
to the the last one of hamas's high
ranking members you're probably well out
of the qualified people because in order
to pull together any kind of movement
that's affecting the world that much you
probably have to be a top
1center and you don't have to kill too
many people in a group before they run
out of
1centers it's 1% 1% is exactly the right
number now I don't know if they've done
it yet I don't know if they've got them
all but chances are the capability of
Hamas has now gone from darn near genius
to blithering
idiot
probably all right ladies and gentlemen
it's a
Sunday are you all planning to vote I
did a uh little survey yesterday oh I
should check that out um I did a little
poll in which I asked uh people if they
had um convinced other people to vote
this year when they had not done it in
Prior years
now personally I don't think I've ever
even tried to convince anybody to vote I
mean I've done the public you know the
public thing of oh go vote but not
really right I never really really tried
this year I really really tried and I
did it in person and I did it you know
publicly um in person I think I got
several uh and in public in in public a
number of people said you know maybe
that they decided to vote because of
things I said but it's not just me of
course so I asked and something like
60% of the people answered said that
they got other people to vote meaning
for
Trump now do you think that I could get
thousands of people to answer a poll and
60% of them would say they got somebody
extra to vote they had not voted before
and maybe more than one
I don't think that number could possibly
be
real unless Trump's going to win in a
landslide if the vote is counted
properly because I've never seen
anything like it the the only thing I'm
worried about is young
men young men are
unpredictable they typically are the
lowest voters you know the lowest
percentage of Voters uh that show up but
this feels different you can get young
men to show up for a prank you can get
them to show up for a
party you can get them to show up for a
protest so there are things you can get
people to show up for but voting may be
too boring and too unimportant but I
think that all of the Dei woke stuff has
activated young men to the point where
they might show up like it's
it really matters like you're you're not
going to get a job it matters it matters
a lot you might you might get drafted I
mean it matters it really matters this
time you you you'll never be able to
afford groceries with the job you can
get it matters so we might see maybe the
biggest turnout of young men it still
won't be as you know big as seniors for
example but we might see the biggest
turnout in history for young men it's
possible
and they would be the least likely to be
captured by pollsters in my opinion I
think they're the least likely so they
would be the big surprise group and it's
also the group that would be able to
hold a prank long enough to pull it off
so I've got a lot writing on men young
men
so it's up to you guys I mean it's up to
everybody of course but there is one
group that a little extra a little extra
pressure let's just say that the whole
world might depend on young men it has
before young men won all of our Wars
that we
won and uh they may have to win this one
too we we hope there's no bullets this
time all
right ladies and gentlemen that's all
I've got to say for this Sunday before
you go off and have a tremendous day
make sure you buy buy the dillberg
calendar which you can only get online
