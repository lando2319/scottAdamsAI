good morning everybody
and welcome
to just about the best time you've ever
had your life
and it's just going to get better i hate
to say this is the highlight of your
whole life but it's the highlight
so far
it could get better i think it might
audio is good
video is good
my goodness what a wonderful start to
the day is anybody exercising
because exercising to the news
is the best thing ever in fact
i like to exercise in the afternoon when
i'm watching a show called the five
on fox
i call it exercising
that's right
i don't know if there's a clever way to
exercise to this but
if you can come up with a clever name
like exeter fiving
let me know
all right uh if you'd like to take it up
a level
and i know you do you're that kind of
people would you settle would you settle
for
a mildly interesting
live stream no
no you're not that kind of people you
are smarter and sexier than the average
person and you want to have it all and
if you want to have it all all you need
is a copper mug or a glass a tanker
chelsea stein a canteen jugger flask a
vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
unparalleled unparalleled pleasure
it's called
the simultaneous it's famous around the
world it's going to happen to you right
now if you're prepared get ready go
that was good because it was totally the
first simultaneous sip i've taken today
all
right
fake news let's do the fake news first
that that fake news alert
uh
there's some fake news about uh the
order of
uh the timeline of trump getting covet
and the fake news is saying that he
tested positive and then went and
interacted with a bunch of people
i'm summarizing a detailed boring story
do you think that's true
did he test positive and then go
interact with a bunch of people
sort of true
[Laughter]
here's the part that they left out
the first test that was positive was a
low-grade
test
so they used a higher quality test and
he tested negative
and then he interacted with people so is
it true
that he tested positive and then
soon after when i interacted with people
it's true it's also true that he
immediately tested negative right after
he tested positive
so it's just fake news uh well it's fake
news in the sense that they left out
a really important point
they get tested negative
now i'm not going to defend anything he
did or didn't do i'll just make that
that very uh specific point that the
news uh is fake
about
this story
well alec baldwin uh interestingly
claims that he did not pull the trigger
on the set of rust in the round that
killed his cinematographer
and wounded the director
apparently the trigger pulled itself
or the gun just fired itself
now
huh
i'm no
public relations expert
but here's how i would have played that
the moment alec baldwin said you know i
didn't even pull the trigger
i feel like i would have told the public
that little tidbit
right away
right away
doesn't that feel important
i didn't pull the trigger
now
who knows if that's true or false
but it's pretty important to
denote it why are we just finding that
out now
really
you don't think there was one other
person
who already knew that he said he didn't
pull the trigger there was nobody on the
set
who was a witness to him saying my god i
didn't even pull the trigger
there's something a little bit wrong
with this story isn't there
who waits how long have we waited since
the event itself how many weeks has it
been
has it been a month
a month
so there's something wrong with that
story and uh i believe it might be
yet another sign of a poltergeist
invasion so so far
according to cnn the following things
have happened recently an suv drove
itself into a crowd of people
a rock
uh hurled itself and hurt somebody
and now
quite alarmingly a trigger of a gun has
pulled itself
so
uh that's not the worst of it it's
possible that a portal to hell has been
opened
and posted geist are are running the
show right now
but it's even worse than that we're
actually having cr crimes now
featuring criminals
and i know this is weird but
featuring criminals who don't have an
ethnicity
now that's new
in the past people always had an
ethnicity so i assume this is more of a
portal from hell
situation where maybe some demons are
coming through who have no ethnicity
because the reporting is now
making sure it doesn't tell us
so just keep an eye out for the
poltergeist
had an interesting back and forth with
a uh professional statistician i believe
joe shipman and we were talking about
making decisions in the face of
incomplete data
and i was
i was calling that guessing
that if you're making a decision with
incomplete data
that you're guessing and he pushed back
on that and said no you know
in the real world i'm paraphrasing a
little bit but in the real world
you never have you know perfect data but
you can still make pretty good decisions
if you do the right
kind of analysis
and i'll give you his argument then i'm
going to counter it he said some of us
need to make the best of the information
we have
using as scientific a process as we can
because decisions can't be avoided i
agree you have to make a decision
sometimes
part of the process is identifying one's
assumptions and biases to the extent
possible
it's not a perfect process but it merits
recognition
okay so far
it's a and he said it's imprecise to
call it guessing because that's what i
did i called it guessing
specifically the topic was guessing if
you made the right decision about the
vaccination
but he's talking more generically here
because there's a whole science of
decision-making under uncertainty
correct
there is a process for decision making
under uncertainty where you take into
account multiple possible outcomes
correct monte carlo simulation etc one
of one of the good ways to do that is
you run all the possibilities and you
see if there's any possibility that's
bad
because it could be that
every combination of variables you end
up either you know
positive or very positive or negative or
very negative so it'd be good to know if
no matter what you do you end up
positive or negative right
so yeah that's that's definitely a
process i've used that process
professionally
and he says guessing has the connotation
of identifying the most likely outcome
and acting as if it is the only one well
no i mean i don't accept that definition
of guessing but
that's not important
and he says i won't allow any
characterization of what i have said as
guessing uh the difference
he says and then he makes a good case
for his own track record of using his
own technique
he said with covid russiagate and many
other recent controversies
not only have i been shown to be right
i've been right for the right reasons
which is actually a good comment
if you write for the right reasons as
opposed to coincidentally right that
does mean something
if your arguments hold up you get credit
i agree with that
but here's here's my counter to it okay
um
let's take russiagate
how hard was it to know that that was
i think a lot of people just said
oh democrats in the news they're all
liars
all the time
so it's not real
and then it turned out you were right
how many people did that they just said
well it's coming from people who lie all
the time about everything
so i'll say this is a lie too and then
it turned out you're right
was it because you did a monte carlo
simulation with all of the variables
nope
nope
sometimes you just need one variable
but
i give you this caution
there is nothing more dangerous than
being right about something big
if you want to completely destroy a
human brain
one way to do it is to be coincidentally
right about something big
because you know what happens right
you get cocky
and then you're pretty sure you can
peer into the you know complex
super variables and get the right answer
next time because you did it the last
time
you can do it again
you were right on that russia gay thing
so you're going to be right on this
vaccination thing right you've got a
track record now now if it were just one
thing that would be less convincing
and
as
as joe shipman points out he's been
right on a number of things and by the
way this is exactly the process i
recommend
you should look at the things that you
predicted
write them down or say them in public so
you can be held to it
and then see how well he did
now joe says that he's been tracking his
own predictions
and they've been more right than wrong
that that's my interpretation and so he
thinks that his process is good
what do you think
well he might just be a smart person
who knows you know bs when he sees it
could be that
and it's also pretty easy to just guess
that people are lying about stuff
because it seems like lately they almost
always are it's just a pretty easy guess
now
take my situation with uh
um
predicting that trump would win in 2016.
by my own by my own uh description
should i
should i now be ruined because i got one
right
well it depends if it was a guess
in my case well i thought i could see
something that other people couldn't see
which is he had the most
incredible persuasion talent stack i'd
ever seen
and i just happened to have a
skill set that allowed me to see that
before other people could see it
now i would say that at this point
even the democrats say he's the most
persuasive person in politics they just
don't like which way he's persuading
and i think the republicans would agree
he's the most persuasive person that's
happened lately
so that was a case where i could simply
see a variable that was invisible to
other people and it was the biggest
variable
in my opinion it was the biggest one
so that was really a very very special
case
and i tell myself that so i don't get
cocky
i tell myself that i only got that right
because the weird weird coincidence that
my talent stack was exactly
the right stack
to see a thing that was invisible to
other people
how often does that happen
right i can't think of another time
really
well actually i can think one other time
if it turns out i'm right
about there's no sonic weapon that's
causing the savannah thing there might
be something causing it
but i don't think it's a sonic weapon
i would say that too
is exactly in my
skill stack
so i can simply see things that people
can't see because of a specific kind of
training
now i would say if i get those right
those probably don't break my brain
because
as joe said i got i would have gotten
them right for the right reasons
but
i will say this
if you're saying to yourself i'm looking
into a complicated situation where i
don't have a special insight
which is most things right most things
you don't have a special insight if
you're looking at all these variables
swimming around and then you say to
yourself all right i believe this one
not this one
i feel less closer to guessing
to me i'm gonna i'm gonna stick with my
characterization of that as guessing
because i think that
unless you have a special insight like i
just described
you don't know which variables you've
made correct assumptions about
so your assumptions will determine your
outcome it's not really the analysis
itself
all right so it's easy to imagine that
the analysis gave you the answer when
really it was just your assumptions and
that was guessing
so you have guesses in your analysis and
i don't know how anything but a guest
could come out the other end
but i will take
where i usually go hard at my critics or
even just people who disagree with me
i'm going to say that joe shipman has
some really good points here
about how there are times that you you
can do better than i think chance
if you've got some special skills on
on analysis which he does so i would
guess he probably does do better than
chance
but
if you get one right
by pure luck
you you're
you're broken from that point on you'll
always think that you can do that and
you just can't it was luck
and especially especially bad with
elections
because if you get election and there
are two people in the in the running
about half of the country is going to
think they guessed right
and then they think they'll think they
can do it again if if all they're doing
is looking at all the variables
as again
which is different from my specific case
where i had a an extra vision on
something
which is rare
yeah
all right i'm gonna call out uh tulsi
gabbard for having a good strategy
for becoming president without looking
like she's trying
and it goes like this
correct me if i'm wrong so check my
assumptions as i go would you would you
agree that tulsi gabbard stands out
as someone who is willing to say that
the people on the other side of the
political
aisle do not necessarily suck
is anybody else saying that
give me giving the name of one other
person
who is willing to say you know not in
direct words but in lots of different
ways that the people on the other side
might not be pieces of
there's nobody else right
mansion okay mansion but i think
manchester is really talking about
himself when he does that
i think man should
you know maybe a little bit talking
about himself because he agrees on them
it's different if you agree with them
but
saying that somebody's not a piece of
 if you completely disagree with
them is actually kind of rare
now so far in our highly highly divided
world
is tulsi gabbard getting any traction
not much
not much
because we're not ready for it are we
we're not really we're kind of committed
to the divisiveness at the point at this
point because it gives us a dopamine hit
but
just like bernie sanders turned out to
be somewhat brilliant by being
consistent for decades
until his time came
so the world changed until it matched
bernie or very close
and although he didn't win the
presidency he made a big impact
so sometimes just hanging around
with a strategy that nobody else has at
least at a high level
suddenly
you know the situation in the world
could change to people saying you know
i'm just so done with the divisiveness
is there anybody who won't give me that
and she'll be the only one
there won't be any other choice
there's no other choice
let me tell you how a smart democrat
could become president
easily
easily now i've told you that i think
republicans will sweep things if they
stay the same
but they won't
and the mississippi abortion
case that the supreme court is looking
at that would in my opinion would change
the entire calculation
so if abortion gets banned or cut back
in any major way by the supreme court
democrats are going to come out like
crazy
let me ask you in the comments and no
cheating
don't do any cheating
don't look this up this has to be off
the top of your head no googling okay
first just first
thought
what percentage of americans
want the abortion question to be just a
personal decision between them and their
doctor
what percentage of americans
want it to be a
legal abortion between them and their
doctor
let me read off your numbers uh 45 65 65
80 80 90
75 51 25 53
over here you've got 70s 40s 25s 2075s
look how different your numbers are
they're people saying 25 percent
and people say 95 and 90
you're not in the same world
it's like you don't live in the same
planet
i could see if you know if the number
was 70 but you guessed 80 or 60 you know
you're in the ballpark
but the real number is 75.
i had i didn't even know that until this
morning i thought it was closer to like
60 percent if i would have guessed
but 75 percent of people in a recent
poll
said that they
want to keep it between their doctor and
and
the
woman can you trust the polling
well as 75 you can yes
because that means that no matter what
is well over 50 percent
yeah a 75 i would say yeah a clear
majority
wants us now we don't live in a country
where the majority necessarily gets what
they want on every single question
our system doesn't always give them what
they want
but i would think that if the supreme
court goes the other way the republicans
will have
found a way to snatch defeat from the
jaws of victory
as it stands now i think a generic
republican could destroy any generic
democrat
would you agree
how many would agree with that basic
statement i mean i i say it as an
absolute but you know i don't mean it
that way
there at the moment there's a gigantic
advantage to be a republican
in any upcoming election i would say
right but the republicans
at least in mississippi
found a way to maybe reverse all of that
because the abortion thing will get
people on the streets
if it goes you know if it goes away it
looks like it's going to go so i think
the republicans may have given up almost
their entire advantage
through the if the supreme court guts
rovers wait i don't know that they will
a good chance of it
but
here's here's
anyway getting back to uh
the tulsi gabbard strategy let me tell
you how a
democrat could become president
easily
i'll just give you the strategy
all right i'll tell you the strategy and
they'll say eat just easily they could
become president it goes like this
all you have to do
is say you really like the people who
disagree with you
the republicans the conservatives
and
spend some time with them you know so
that it's real you're actually you know
laughing with them you're spending some
time you're inviting them into the white
house if you're if you're uh they're
even on your campaign you're meeting
with bunches of people on the other side
who's done that
nobody
like nobody's done that it would be easy
how hard would it be to say that you
like
citizens of the united states if you're
running for president the easiest thing
in the world
i'm not i've never seen it done
it would be the easiest thing
so first say that you respect them and
you genuinely like the other side
big deal
easiest thing in the world nobody's ever
done it
number two
on every topic
fully explain the other side's view
who does that
absolutely nobody
absolutely nobody nobody's ever done
that
and it's easy
and it's useful and nobody would be
opposed to it
nobody would be opposed to that
now actually that's that's an
exaggeration too because trolls are
opposed to everything but if you just
said i really like
let me just say uh you're right imagine
you're a democrat you're running for
president and i'll just model what i
would say
you know on this abortion question it's
really divisive
but i got to say
the republican view now i'm just
modeling a democrat this is not my
personal view there are no personal
views in what i'm going to say
i'm just telling you how you would win
so you know the
i really really respect the republican
view
about banning abortion
because their instinct is exactly right
their instinct is to protect
life
in the extreme to real to really make
that a top priority and you know i have
to admit from a moral perspective
that is a very very strong and
respectable opinion
however
we also live in a world where we have to
make tough tough choices
and sometimes the question is not
what the choice is but who makes it
who makes the choice
and freedom is a pretty big deal in this
country
and sometimes you're going to be
comparing freedom
to life itself
these are the biggest questions that
anybody could ever make
and so
as president your president
i'll i'll give you this promise
that i will be as uninvolved in your
personal decisions as i possibly can be
because i think
that our system
does favor personal freedom
even over life
we do it when we go to war
we we value freedom over life itself
it's a consistent thing we've done in
this country and let me tell you i fully
appreciate
the republican view and i think it's
important
there should be somebody fighting for
life in this country
all the time
somebody should be fighting for life
but it would be a very useful
useful um
conversation
to be adults and know that sometimes
freedom itself is the alternative
sometimes life is the most important
variable sometimes freedom
and as your president i'm not going to
make that decision for you i'm going to
support the majority of the country and
i'm going to support the supreme court
when they make that decision
but you
need to decide about freedom
versus possibly life itself
and i will respect both sides of this
but i'm not going to get into it because
i think this is best
served at the lowest most local level
so
now
you know i picked the most controversial
topic
because
you know it's the hardest one right so
if i could make that work then you could
see how this would work for everything
you could take every topic and do the
same thing
you could say here's your argument
here's the other side
they're both pretty good arguments
they're both pretty good arguments from
people who really care about the country
but somebody has to make a decision
somebody has to make a decision between
two
absolutely honest good arguments
and i'm going to do that for you
i know that half of you are going to
hate me
but i think you appreciate the process
sometimes we have to hold the process up
the system
the republic
the constitution
sometimes that has to just be the winner
and we don't always get our way
but we've bought into a system in which
we agree that sometimes we don't get our
way
we do trust the system
so i'm going to make sure that the
system works for you
i can't guarantee you're going to get
why you want every one of you and don't
don't ask me for that that's not
practical
take take that answer and compare to
everything that any politician has ever
said
it's easy
to be
president it's easy
the the steps for for just walking into
the office
are just trivial
i just did it i just modeled it
now if i if i wanted to be president and
didn't have a background that would
uh
be make it impossible for me to ever run
for public office
uh
i could easily be president with just
just i just modeled it i could walk into
the job and anybody could anybody would
just have to use the technique
it's not about me
it's about whether you understand how to
persuade
now
i would say that that's trump's biggest
weakness
in some ways he's he was the perfect
candidate for a highly divisive world
because you know he
he was sort of a champion for a team and
he was good at it but i think
if he came back as for a second term
and said you know i'm just going to show
more respect to the other side
i'm not going to change any of my
opinions
but i'd like you to know that i respect
your opinions and just and just do that
is there anything that would keep him
out of the office
nope
imagine if trump had said about
kids in cages
my god kids in cages is terrible it was
terrible when obama did it it's terrible
when we did it can somebody help me fix
this
i call on the people of the united
states
to
to help
if somebody's got an idea how to make
this go away while still keeping our
national priorities
because we have to keep a national
priority which is a good border
and then i would say
you're arguing about the wrong thing
with the border
you're arguing whether it should be open
or closed that's the wrong question
you should be talking about having a
system that you could open it and close
it on demand
based on some logical or reasonable
criterion
and that's what i'll give you
we'll have a strong border
but how much is open or closed is a
completely separate decision
and i'll tell you how we make it i'll
show you the whole process we'll weigh
the
the risks of you know crime or maybe
covet at the moment against the economic
benefits i'll tell you what the
economists say i'll lay it out for you
i'll even tell you if it's good for your
income
zone might be good for rich people to
let in more immigrants because they get
cheap labor i'll just say that
if you're rich this is pretty good
pretty good to let in lots of immigrants
if you're in the lower income
level it might be bad for you because
now you're competing against more people
so i'm just going to tell you exactly
what's good for you and what's bad and
then i'm going to tell you what the
decision is and some of you won't like
it
all right
it would be easy to be president and i
think tulsi gabbard is the closest
to what i just described maybe you know
naturally by temperament
i would just be guessing on that
but strategy wise
she's a real dark horse because
she could just sort of wait
because she's young
just sort of wait
and maybe in you know
15 years
it's exactly what we need we we just
might be so sick of the
you know the two teams that we just say
just let's just try something else
can we all just just try something else
and she would be the only alternative
there you go
all right germany's putting restrictions
on the unvaccinated so if you're
unvaccinated you i don't know can't go
places
and
again i would like to
point out
that
well you know let me let me back up a
little bit yeah you've you've heard a
lot of republicans especially talk about
american
exceptionalism
how many of you buy into that
american exceptionalism like there's
there's something magical or special
about america
most of you right
most of the people watching this do
because a lot of you learn leaning right
yeah a lot of you what does it mean to
you
can you define it
exceptional in one specific way
if you're just saying we're better blah
blah blah that's that's
but freedom of speech well other places
have some freedom of speech
absolutely what makes us better guns
no
rule of law
but those those are systems does that
make us exceptional or the just the
system is exceptional
i don't know i never bought into the
american exceptionalism that seemed a
little bit
i don't know
it seemed a little going a little bit
too far definitely we were successful
you know if you said america is
you know one of the most or the most
successful country of all time i don't
know could you back that up
maybe
i'd be okay with that
but there's something about the
exceptionalism part that bothers me
until i saw this story about germany
putting restrictions on the unvaccinated
that isn't going to happen here
let me tell you
i never felt like we were exceptional
until i saw this
germany
seriously germany
now maybe we are exceptional because of
our gun ownership it does it does change
things absolutely changes things because
one of the things it does is it tells
the public that they know they're in
charge
if the public didn't know they were in
charge of the country
they would act like they weren't and
then the government would be in charge
but because of gun ownership
there's a very large population
a percentage of the population that
knows for sure
that the citizens run the country do
they know that in germany
do the german citizens think they run
the country
because we do
i sure do
i i think we run the country and i think
our politicians will do whatever the
 we tell them to
right
now the problem is
the people themselves haven't decided
right when they decide by large enough
numbers that they tell the government
what to do
and pretty much the government does it
the supreme court thing with the with
abortion is sort of a weird exception
because it could be one of those things
that goes way against the will of the of
the majority it's possible
but but we do allow that there can be
special cases like that that's why we
have a republic right
for exactly that reason
i i've never felt more exceptional
than watching germany lock down the
unvaccinated and watching australia do
the same thing
that's just not going to happen here it
just isn't
and by the way if you're
leaning left
and you're wondering why it's not going
to happen here
it goes of the right
and you should actually be quite happy
about that
you might be against gun ownership for
lots of reasons and they might even
sound pretty good
but you have to appreciate there are
some advantages
you know the people who used to say
i know the people on the left argue this
they say what are your little handguns
and even your
ars what are they going to do against
the entire military of the united states
to which i say we're not going to be
fighting any militaries
the military's going to join the people
since when is the military going to
fight the the citizens of the united
states no no they're on our side
again
it would depend on the topic right if if
it's a topic where you know 80 of the
country is on the same side
the military will be on that side too
because it's a you know military of the
people so no we're not going to be
fighting the military the military will
be extra guns
on our side
you don't think so depends on the topic
right
you could imagine a topic where it would
be the reverse but in this lockdown
stuff
no
no the the american military isn't going
to make you stay in your house
let me say this as clearly as i possibly
can
the american military any form of it
will never make you stay in your house
for if you're unvaccinated that's not
going to happen
and if they try
you better be pretty happy that there
are a lot of armed americans
all right
here's something to scare the hell out
of you how many of you owned bitcoin
show me and show me in the comments
bitcoin owners weigh in probably quite a
few of you
yeah seeing lots of yeses some nopes but
mostly the yes is the ones who answer
this question
loss of bitcoin all right now i will
scare you to death
uh as you know uh anything can be hacked
but
the the blockchain and bitcoin it would
be difficult
very difficult to hack it would you
agree
very very difficult to hack it
unless
you had a quantum computer
now the quantum computers have not yet
reached the point where they can hack uh
your bitcoin and simply take it from you
which by the way
is perfectly legal
that's right
if somebody can hack your bitcoin
and take it from you
they can do it
there's no law against it
i don't know why
but there isn't
um
and
china is warning a professor uh jintao
ding of
sing wow
that might be
close to how you pronounce it university
explained
um
and he said it isn't against the law but
of course he was he's chinese so maybe
he's talking about it's not against the
law in china is it against the law in
america
maybe it's against the law somewhere
all right i would imagine this against
the law somewhere
and uh but it doesn't matter if it's not
against the law in china
well you there goes your money
actually it doesn't matter if it's
against the law it's gonna happen anyway
so
uh here are two things you need to know
about that one
maybe i'd want to get into a second
opinion though
why would i want a second opinion on
this
anybody anybody
why would i want a second opinion on
this
because it's coming from
china duh
and china doesn't love bitcoin do they
can you fact check me on that
china's anti-bitcoin am i right yeah
they hate it
so here's a person from a university who
is not afraid to say in public
that bitcoin might be a big big mistake
to own it
which happens to coincide with exactly
the opinion of the government of china
because they don't like bitcoin
so
uh
scott stop being silly the blockchain
would be forked uh
the code would be upgraded and we would
move forward on the new chain are you
saying that a forked and new chain would
then be invulnerable from a quantum
computer attack
is that what you're saying clarify
please
now i do understand the the basic
concept
that the good guys
can stay ahead of the bad guys
that you can
apparently there's already
algorithms that can defend against a
quantum attack or there there's already
newer encryptions that can do that
so
i'm not sure i believe
this chinese professor
who's with me
how much credibility would you give a
chinese professor who says this in
public and coincidentally it's good for
the chinese government
law
but if i hear it from an american source
who's also an expert
i'd be pretty pretty worried
hearing it from a chinese expert
50 worried
hearing it from an american expert
let me tell you if naval tells me this
is real
i'm i'm getting rid of all my bitcoin
the same day
i hate to put the pressure on you in
naval but
i i i can't imagine there's anything you
would hate to hear more than that
because because it would sound like
giving investment advice
so i apologize duvall
to use your name in vain there but
honestly if naval told me that uh
quantum computers are gonna hack my
bitcoin uh i would cash that out so
fast
anyway um
somebody mentioned that pete bootage
looks like the grinch when he smiles the
other grinch has that
smile i can't do an impression of it
but uh and then somebody else mentioned
that kamal harris reminds him of a hyena
which i get
and i just gotta add i've said this
before but it's funny every time
once you see somebody's animal
you know like mitch mcconnell looks like
a turtle
the first time you see it
that's it
that's all you'll ever see
once you see their animal
you're gonna see their animal every time
all right my critics have been so beaten
down by me lately
that they're starting to criticize me
for imaginary future offenses
seriously
the most frequent criticism i'm getting
lately
is that in the future i'm going to do
something bad
and that in the future i'm going to lie
about something
in the future
i'm going to have to do something to
cover up something
to which i say
have we totally run out of problems in
the present
you've completely given up
on things i'm actually doing and have
done
yeah and really all you have left is
things that you literally imagine i'll
do in the future
that's not even a thought crime that's a
future thought crime
talk about giving up let me ask you
something uh for those of you who follow
me on twitter which is a lot of you
watching this
how many times have you seen me
in a back and forth with one of my
critics and then the last thing they say
is word salad
how many how many of you seen me do that
repeatedly i was doing it again this
morning producing some word salad now
you see in the comments if those of you
who haven't seen it
i can tell you on the locals platform
it's just a string of yeses
people have seen it on probably youtube
there are fewer people who follow me on
twitter
yeah so people see it every day
and the reason i pointed out is that
that's a tell for cognitive dissonance
so when i trigger people into cognitive
dissonance which essentially just
showing them that what they believed to
be true was completely wrong
the word solid response is is just the
tell
that's that's how you know that they're
in it and the reason i bring it up is
that the more often you see it
the easier it is to spot
it's a pattern recognition thing you
just have to train yourself and once you
see your critic devolve into word salad
and usually the word sal is even not
exactly the same topic it's like a
related
cousin point that they're trying to sell
as their original point sort of thing
um
yeah uh get get good at recognizing word
salad because it's a good tell for
cognitive dissonance and at that point
you know there's no point in arguing
all right uh
i saw a new standard for mental health
today do you ever wonder if you have
good mental health
because what if you were crazy and you
were the only one who didn't know it
right
because that's the problem with being
crazy
other people can see it but maybe you
don't know it
well here's a new standard from uh
twitter user uh oh the free manatee
uh he tweeted this he said rachel maddow
just did a master class on the ethos of
the republican party
in advance of tomorrow's scotus oral
arguments on abortion law in the
mississippi
she just broke down their entire raison
d'etre that's my french pronunciation
there in like 10 minutes and then he
then he gives us his standard he says i
appreciate that she helps remind me i'm
not crazy
so his standard is that he
if his opinion
matches up
with a woman who's a known
liar um
that he must be sane
so if his opinions agree with a known
liar
he's he's still good
so you might want to adopt that standard
if you know somebody who's
pretty well documented to be foolish yet
if your opinions agree with that person
who's a known liar and full of
then you're good
your mental health
perfect
well simone sanders senior advisor and
the chief spokesperson for
vice president harris
she's resigning
cat
roof
huh
well why did that take her so long
because uh if you're
if you are the senior advisor to
kamal harris
you're not looking good
i i don't think your resume is benefited
by being the advisor to the worst
advised person on the planet earth
name one person that you would say say
now we're not there so we don't know
exactly who's saying what
to whom
but
can you think of any candidate
who would have worse advice as far as
you can tell
than
kamal harris i literally would call her
out as the worst advised politician of
all time
dan quayle maybe
but but in recent times
all right well i think that's telling us
that something's going to happen there
with kamala harris and it's probably not
good for kamal harris
well this school shooter uh i won't say
his name or even the school
uh but he's being charged with terrorism
as well as you know the normal
murder-ish type charges
and i said to myself
terrorism
what would justify a terrorism
charge
now the claim is that he terrorized the
students who were not shot that
everybody will have ptsd and they will
be
damaged for life and they i think that's
true they will have ptsd they will be
damaged for life even if they were not
shot just by being there
but uh i looked at the law for
what terrorism is in the state
their state
and here's the
part of the law that they're trying to
apply
see if you think this fits this school
shooter
who apparently had no political motives
that we know of because apparently he
talked about his intentions so as far as
we know no political motives of the
shooter but see if you think this
applies
quote
an act that is intended to intimidate or
coerce
a civilian population or influence or
affect the conduct of government or a
unit of government through intimidation
or coercion
so part of this is about intimidating
the government and there's no evidence
of that that we're aware of so that
probably doesn't apply
but the first bar is an act that is
intended to intimidate
or coerce a civilian population well we
don't see them trying to coerce anybody
so we'd have to back up all the way to
intimidate
so as an act that is intended to
intimidate a civilian population
is there any evidence
that that was his intention
i'm not aware of any
so can we just say
that he's being charged with terrorism
because he's a white and male
is that fair
do you think he'd be charged with
terrorism if he were black
no
no he would not
no he would not
but i think it's also fair to say most
of these mass shooters are white
most of them not all
not all but
haven't been a ton of black mass
shooters have they relatively speaking
now if it were by population you know it
would be 13 of them so you wouldn't
expect a lot
um well i think we should just call this
racism because it is
in my opinion
in my opinion uh the only reason for
this terrorism charge is that he's a
white male
does anybody disagree with that
given that there's nothing about the
terrorism law that seems to apply to any
information we've heard anyway
calls for speculation
what about gang shootings oh yeah okay
that's a mass shooting you're right
yeah yeah if you count gang shootings
good point
but those tend to be a little more
spontaneous no actually they're not i
guess a lot of them are planned as well
they're just being race conscious not
racist
all right
greg
kelly on twitter
tweeted this
uh he complimented me first and he said
is the normally brilliant
scott adams still enthralled with
secretary pete
meaning bootage the lazy media
fake veteran who's uh shelling out blah
blah then he says some bad things about
secretary uh pete buddha judge
now
would you say that i'm enthralled with
pete buddha judge
does anybody think that's a good
characterization
nope
no
i've simply said that his talent stack
for evaluating infrastructure decisions
is exactly the right one
i don't say that he'll use those talents
correctly
i don't say that he won't politicize it
i don't say that he won't make any other
mistake how would i know
but his his talent stack is exactly on
point for that very specific thing
because he was a consultant for years
and that that's what they did
make that kind of priority
decision-making stuff
so here's my uh
here's my response
um
i'm not exactly enthralled
i think your throat would be the wrong
wrong
so not enthralled
but
that's an example of binary thinking so
the binaries
that i call them now the binaries
can only see that there's a left opinion
and a right opinion
and any other opinion is invisible
it's actually invisible
you know i said something uh
before that i know none of you exactly
understood unless you're actually
hypnotist yourself the hypnotist can do
something that's invisible to you
it's because you just your your
framework or your mental
your mental framework uh doesn't include
it
so if you just do things that are
outside of people's mental framework
it's actually just invisible
they think it's something else
so the binary is that i'm either all
left or all right
and i vigorously you know
try to make sure that that's not the
case
and
uh you seem to really like him during
the primaries yeah
i did
that is true
but enthralled
am i am i hypnotized i can't see any any
negative things
i've certainly also criticized them
uh i'm pretty much not enthralled by
anybody people have pluses and minuses
somebody says i was raised by hypnotist
my skills are untamed
i've known people who were raised by uh
hypnotists
and uh they do pick up the skill
um
scott you do understand as they crack a
bitcoin your real money in your bank is
also in trouble
probably so
um
pete must thank god for kamala harris's
existence every day
all right um
we see your false paradigms and scroll
man arguments we just let you slide to
avoid the ban hammer
really
well i'll ban that guy
i'll hide you
you you are hidden
uh
anybody who watches me who doesn't know
that i'm gonna ban you for
generic
uh generic criticism
generic criticism will get you banned
every time specific criticism
all good
all good you have a real point i'd like
to hear it
all right um
fiji has reopened its borders really
i've been to fiji is pretty awesome
um and the fed yeah
tulsi is a
she's a gun grabber somebody says is
tulsi uh
anti-gun
i don't think she's a
my my guess without looking into it is
that she's in favor of some restrictions
but
yeah she's ex-military i can't believe
she's anti-gun
scott doesn't understand the bird which
is the bald eagle
oh tulsi fixed her second amendment ar15
statement i would imagine she did
all right uh
oh somebody's predicting that
kamal harris will be bought off
uh what what is a german supposed to do
now the public is completely brainwashed
well
good luck germany you know i
um
a lot of people uh
believe that we're in some kind of the
beginning of some kind of a permanent
state
and i completely disagree
yeah there may be some things that
linger and become permanent but we're
not going to be in covet lockdown
forever
all right
has anybody heard about the covent pill
did that get approved by the fda
i haven't heard
what is my animal
you tell me
oh a question on the abortion
question again i'm not going to give you
my opinion on it because i i just don't
think it's useful to hear my opinion on
abortion
um
my my opinion is that women should take
care of it collectively and individually
but
uh so 15 weeks
how how many people would not know
they're pregnant
by 15 weeks
in the comments this is a serious
question
uh how how common would it be
to not know you're pregnant
in 15 weeks
because i'm wondering how unreasonable
it is
to ask somebody to make a decision
within 15 weeks really maybe within a
month because then that's the time
you're sure
you saw your daughter kick at 13 weeks
you've seen a few people who didn't know
until they went until they went into
labor
but those people are missing periods at
the very least right
you know somebody's going to have to
inform me better about
female biology but how often how often
do you not know you're pregnant
because you're missing your period
more than once in a row right you
wouldn't test
would you not test for the women here
question for the women
if you missed your period
would you test yourself for pregnancy
and if you missed it twice in a row
would you test yourself for pregnancy
you would right
so i'm wondering how unreasonable it is
to have a 15-week ban
is that unreasonable
i'm not even sure who suffers by that
and the other thing i i question is
uh what is the age that a baby
can survive now
what what's the youngest surviving baby
that
let's say that one was delivered
somebody says 22 weeks is the
the youngest surviving baby
somebody said 19 20 20 weeks so
somewhere in that range about 20 weeks
so if if the abortion limit were set
below the level that any baby has ever
survived
at least
at least there's some sense to the thing
so again i'm not going to give you my
opinion but so here let me ask you this
question
uh roe versus wade
went into effect when technology was
different agreed
when roe versus wade became law could
you get a home
pregnancy test kit like a little test
strip they didn't exist right
then i don't think
so we didn't have the we did not have
the technology to to know for sure
uh but we also didn't have the
technology that would keep a
smaller baby alive for longer
so
in general
should we review our decisions when
fundamental things change
such as our ability to know
and our ability to keep a baby alive i
mean it could change in either direction
right but is it reasonable to review
your decisions when the context changes
i think it is i think it is reasonable
to review the decision doesn't mean you
change it
but totally reasonable to review it as
the context has changed
so i'm in favor of the process so far
uh i'll i'm quite interested to see what
the supreme court comes up with uh
certainly not my
uh what about aborting the baby after
it's born
yeah i think that's fake news by the way
i know all of you believe that that
happened
that there was that babies are aborted
after they're born
um i'm still on the side that says that
that was always fake news
in terms of a law it was fake news
yeah a lot of you think it's true trust
me i understand that a lot of you think
it was true you're not going to convince
me
and i'm not saying it didn't happen in
one case i'm not talking about an
individual case i'm talking about the
law
there there's no law that says a baby
born live
can be aborted after after it's been
born
right so i think that that was a little
bit of truth fixed you know that got
conflated with a little bit of not truth
all right i gotta run and i'll talk to
you
tomorrow
