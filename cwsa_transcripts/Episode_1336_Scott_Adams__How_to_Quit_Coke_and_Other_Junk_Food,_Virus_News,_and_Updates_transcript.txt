well well well
yeah i'm a little bit late a little bit
late
you know have you ever wondered what
would it be like
to watch coffee with scott adams if he
had
no time to prepare and had literally
just awakened 15 minutes earlier
what would that be like well you're
going to find out
and if you'd like to enjoy it and i know
you would
i mean why not why not enjoy it right
all you need is a copper bug or glass a
tanker challenger style canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip if you
haven't tried it oh i feel sorry for you
those of you who have get ready it's
happening now
do you remember some of you have been
watching me for a while
i once told you that if you take the
dale carnegie course
one of the things that teaches you is
really really
valuable for some situations one of
those situations
is happening right now and let me tell
you a little bit of a story
before i get into that
yeah um years ago i was doing a book
tour going around the country
signing books for whatever book was out
and i got to a denver bookstore one of
the biggest ones in
i don't know the country or denver just
some massive bookstore that had
a room with a stadium audience and
everything i mean it was just a big
bookstore
and i get there and the owner of the
bookstore greets me and says all right
people uh have been waiting for uh two
hours
to see you and i said ah that's great
and
and i thought they meant to sign books
and they said yeah they can't wait to
hear your speech
and i said what yeah your speech that
you're going to give in
10 minutes they're really excited about
it and i said
huh i didn't know i was giving a speech
in 10 minutes
no idea i thought i was just there to
sign books
but apparently the the audience had
already assembled
so there were i don't know several
hundred people in the room waiting to
hear my speech
which didn't exist
so uh my point is the if you take the
dale carnegie course
they actually teach you how to be
prepared to always have a speech
so you can walk into these situations as
i did
i just gave a speech because you just
always have one now it's usually
pieces of speeches right so you have
these little components
that if you get in one of these
situations you can just take them off
the shelf
you say okay i'll take one of these one
of these one of these and i'll just put
them together on the fly
which is what i just did so that story
about the
bookstore some of you have heard it
before and the point of it is
it's one of my shelf points
always keep a few on the shelf so
anytime you get
you get a little situation like this you
go oh
i'll introduce it by the the denver
bookstore story
and then i'll have a good momentum going
and then i'll find other pieces as i go
i'm going to give you today my first
mandatory
twitter follow recommendation
you ready now when i say mandatory
i'm going to the next level i'm taking
it up because i've told you before there
are some people you should follow i'll
probably mention them again
but there are a number of people who are
just way better to follow
than other people because they have some
kind of insight or
they're just good at tweeting or
something and i'm going to give you my
first ever
mandatory follow meaning that if you
follow me
i'm telling you it's mandatory glenn
greenwald
now if you don't already follow glenn
greenwald here's the first thing you
need to know
has nothing to do with politics he talks
about politics
so his domain is politics but that's not
the recommendation
he's one of the few people who every
time he writes or tweets
he can take the the curtain of reality
it just pushes it back
and then he's done and then he then he
brings it back you know after you're
done reading them
and then you have to live in that other
artificial world for a while
and then glenn greenwald says something
and he pulls the curtain back again and
you can see the real world for a little
bit
now usually he's pulling back the
curtain on um the media itself
so that you can see that you're living
in an artificial world
literally that you've created an
artificial
subjective world that you're living in
and he's one of the people
and there aren't many of them who don't
live in that world
i don't know why i would love to know
the history of what
you know hallucinogenics he's ever tried
in his life if any
i would love to know how he became who
he is because somehow he lives outside
that world
and he can just pull the curtain back
and look and show you
it's kind of amazing so he's a mandatory
follow
because he shows you what's on the other
side of the curtain
and you don't get that from everybody
i'll give you other mandatories as we
go along here here's a way to know if
you were dumb
a lot of you have been wondering am i
dumb
do you ever have that thought sometimes
it might be the imposter
effect you're not really dumb but you
worry that you are compared to other
people
um but one way to know you are dumb is
if you hear an
argument and the first thing you think
is
oh you love that person you're talking
about
why don't you just kiss them apparently
you love them
okay that that if that's your response
to an argument you're kind of dumb
you're not really ready for talking in
public
okay if you say oh oh scott you're
defending
you're defending the worst person you're
an apologist for
the worst person if you if that's your
feeling
you're dumb because you can't you for
some reason you can't separate
an argument which could be good or bad
from the people who are making it
if you can't do that you just probably
shouldn't talk in
public maybe that's not for you okay
have i set you up enough
all right let's talk about matt gates
because i i refuse to be limited
by dumb people not understanding that
you can talk about people
you can talk about their situation but
you're not an apologist
defending people you're just not that
person right can we do that
all right i would like to know that the
people who follow me are smart enough
to separate an argument from people if
you can't do that you're
you're on the wrong live stream so let's
do that
as these stories go and of course you
all know the weird
matt gates story there's allegations of
orgies with underage people with no
evidence that we've seen
to suggest any of that's true but the
longer you wait
don't you expect the evidence to come
out big old story like this you know
more and more evidence is coming out
so it becomes a different story the
longer you wait
it starts as one thing and now it's it's
evolving
and it's it has so evolved to sort of a
new thing
and that's that's what i'm going to
describe right now
number one matt gates has said from the
beginning
that any allegations that he was with a
70 year old
excuse me i don't know and the
allegations that he was with the 17 year
old are just completely false
it just doesn't exist but he's gone
further to say
that the accuser doesn't exist
that's pretty gutsy isn't it how many
people
accused of something like this
would go so far as to say not only did i
not do it
but the accuser doesn't exist
now that's a pretty big claim
later if you find out that the accuser
does exist
you know then there's a separate
question of whether anything happened
with that accuser
similar to what was accused
but isn't that is that an unusual claim
don't you think because if somebody knew
that the accuser would
exist in other words if matt gates knew
the person exists
wouldn't that be the worst defense to
say that they don't even exist
right unless is true if
put yourself in that position right now
we can't read his mind
okay so we're not reading his mind but
put yourself in the position
you've been accused of something with an
underage person 17
would you say if you knew you'd been
accused of that would you say
no we did not do that thing i know who
you're talking about
but certainly we didn't do that thing
that's very different from saying nobody
exists
that they just don't exist that's really
different
i don't know that like you'd have to be
pretty sure they don't exist
would you because for sure the most
the simplest thing to prove is that a
person exists
am i wrong is there anything easier to
prove
than that a person exists he's really
it's interesting isn't it because what
happens if they produce the person
he looks really really bad would he put
himself in a position and it's not
it's obvious that he's thought about it
and planned his defense right it's not
like an off-the-cuff thing he said he's
saying this repeatedly and often
the person doesn't exist
now if that person ends up existing
that's going to completely change what i
think about the situation
and for you too i would think but at the
moment
every day that goes by when we don't
hear that the person exists
and by the way i don't think the person
would be still 17
right a number of months have gone by
since the accusations even
began so statistically speaking it seems
deeply unlikely
that there's still a minor involved at
least today
it would be somebody over 18. so do you
think that there is somebody deeply
involved in some kind of a
secret investigation who doesn't want to
be
known at this point and and the leaks
don't produce that person
i don't know there's something sketchy
about the fact that the longer you wait
you don't find out now if tomorrow we
hear the name of the person and the
person exists
change everything right i'm just saying
that every day that goes by
you have to say i'm starting to wonder
if this person exists
that's the reasonable question here's
the other part that i haven't heard
anybody say
there's this weird element of it where
apparently the gases
had involved the fbi before any of this
broke
they had involved the fbi and what they
believed was an extortion attempt
all right so here's the key point uh
that the the gates father and son
both believed that it was an extortion
attempt so much so that they got the law
enforcement involved
all right now we've seen the documents
if you haven't seen them yet they're
they're in the news today we see the
documents and emails going back and
forth
between the two attorney types who
were proposing to gates a senior
that for 25 million dollars they could
get this
alleged um what would you call him
captive
back from iran who may or may not exist
right he may
he may or may not be alive we don't know
there's indication he's not alive but
these two people said they had
indication he was alive
you and i don't know so we don't know if
that guy exists
but imagine you're the gates and the and
people approach you and say for 25
million dollars
we can maybe get this hostage back that
you think
might not even be real okay
you're saying to yourself i'm not even
sure there's a real guy
alive that could be saved and
if he is why isn't the government doing
it right so it's kind of sketchy right
the government wouldn't do this are you
saying that there's nobody in the
government of the united states
who would be interested in getting back
this hostage
so right away it's sketchy right now you
could argue oh the government tried or
they don't care or
they don't believe the story but it's
true so you could
maybe maybe come up with some
stretch of a story that would say yeah
this is the way to do it you wouldn't
use the government
you would you would make some deal with
a private citizen
i mean it doesn't yeah it doesn't pass
to the stiffness right
but but it doesn't fail it so badly
that you could say it's impossible all
right it doesn't pass the sniff test
but it's not completely ruled out
okay now i looked at the documents
the emails back and forth and the way
it's the way it's presented
is that hey there's an extra benefit if
you help us out with this 25 million
dollars
that they call the loan but i don't know
if you would call it a loan
because a loan is something you expect
to get repaid
i don't know if anybody expected that to
be repaid so let's
let's first say that characterizing it
as a loan
is maybe a subjective call even if there
was some alleged plan to repay it
feels a little iffy to me now
when you looked at the documents did you
say to yourself there's an extortion
thing because part of the offer was that
they would
try to lobby the government to
get matt gates cleared or pardoned
presidentially pardoned
of some wrongdoings which were
unspecific
about whatever they heard about these
sex crimes now do you believe that these
two lawyers had enough weight
that they could have done anything at
all to get a pardon for matt gates
should he have done anything that so far
we're not aware of
right so let me say it again there's no
evidence of a specific anything
none no evidence right to the public we
don't know if anybody else has seen
anything
but you and i have seen no evidence of a
crime
now imagine you're the gates's and
you've got this offer that will help you
will help you get out of this alleged
crime
if you help us with this alleged loan
for a captive who is allegedly alive
what do you do with that well what the
gates did is they went to law
enforcement they said
this feels like extortion all right
now let me ask you this we're amateurs
looking from the outside right
and we take the clues and
carpe good to see you uh
that wasn't worth twenty dollars you
should just text me um
but thank you uh what was i saying
i was just good to see you carpe carpe
duncan joins has just joined the uh the
show here
um so we're looking at this situation
and here's my question that i haven't
seen answered
what would cause the gases to think this
was extortion
what would cause them to think that
i think one thing that would certainly
cause you to think that is
wait for it if you were matt gates
and you knew for sure that you had not
been involved
in any sex crimes
right if you thought you had been
involved in
sexual crimes and these people said we
have a way to maybe help you get out
wouldn't you be a little bit interested
in talking to him
if you've done the crime because if
you've done the crime
and allegedly there's an investigation
you know there's witnesses and you know
there's real evidence
now you know you're in real big trouble
you would at least listen to the offer
wouldn't you
yeah you would the only situation in
which you would say
my god this looks like an obvious scam
is if you knew there was no crime
thank you kevin uh
yeah and i haven't seen anybody mention
that
it seems to me that given that these
documents and the offer from the the two
lawyer people
were um they were kind of sketchy
the way they handled it was as if they
didn't believe there was any crime
that's the way they handled it that
means something
they didn't handle it as if well maybe
there is a crime here
they handled it like no crime existed
that's the way you'd handle it this must
be a scam
because there's no crime they're trying
to extort me over no crime
you go right to law enforcement but
suppose you had done the crime and you
knew it
is the first thing you do get to get law
enforcement involved
i don't think so like it doesn't it
doesn't quite fit does it
so i would say the the documents are
quite exculpatory
but we are far from knowing the you know
the final conclusion to any of this
i'm just going to say that the gates
situation is looking better for gates
every day
and worse for his accusers but we'll
keep watching this
meanwhile world war iii has begun i
don't know if you've heard about this
world war three is underway and i'm not
even kidding
there's an actual world war that just
hasn't started apparently the way it's
begun
is that china has
started to capture philippine fishing
territory
by just moving 220 fishing boats
to fish but they're not exactly there to
fish they're really there as part of the
military to
occupy until they have so much
functional control of the sea that for
all practical purposes
china owns it which is what they're
doing to the entire
south china sea it's hard to see that as
not world war three
because they are literally conquering
territory it just happens to be ocean
territory
and they're doing it directly with
assets
it's obvious there's no question about
it it is world war
iii they are they
they are absorbing enormous swaths of
the earth and putting it under chinese
control
parts of the world that people think
china doesn't control
now the thing that makes it um
a little different than say a normal
world war
a little different is that
um china might need might need that
ocean to feed its
people in the future so apparently it's
very rich in fish
and i don't think that they want to
control it just for export
i think that china has a massive problem
feeding his people just because there
are so many of them and they
probably need that fish in the future so
it's not like a regular war of conquest
it might be a war of necessity and i
don't know
what historical precedent there is for a
war of necessity
or presumed advantage slash necessity
it's a little different but it's a
similar strategy they're using that
russia
used in the ukraine where you send in i
guess the
the russians sent in what were called
the little green men
so they were russian soldiers and they
just took off their their uniforms
and uh they they just invaded ukraine
and said
oh no we're not military are you kidding
no look at me i'm not even wearing a
uniform
how could i be russian military until
there are so many of them there it's
it becomes kind of a fact on the ground
that that russia controls some territory
so china's doing the same thing with
these fishing boats
they're just making it a fact that they
own it over time
let's talk about coca-cola
let me start by saying i oppose boycotts
i oppose boycotts as soon as you go down
that boycott road
and you get re-boycotted everybody's
boycotting everybody
it's just better to let business be
business and let politics be politics
it's just better right it's better for
all of us
let's just not be attacking companies
but sometimes
sometimes the company attacks you that's
not your fault
right sometimes the company attacks you
well that's different i i would say
don't boycott a company just because
they have some opinion or something
but if that company attacks you
well you certainly have a right to
defend yourself and so let's talk about
coke so there are many conservatives who
would consider that coke
coca-cola the company has attacked them
in a way by going after georgia for
their voting
id laws which conservatives would say
are just
common sense and it's the same laws or
similar laws
requiring an id to vote similar to most
countries most places
nothing unusual about it so this is just
an attack
by a company on the system and on
conservatives basically
so many conservatives have called for
people to stop drinking coca-cola
matt walsh did a tweet which he summed
it up well i'll just read it he said
coca-cola went from
went from indoctrinating its employees
and critical race theory
to fighting against georgia's voter id
law is there any good reason
for any conservative to ever buy another
coke product again
we could cut them off and out of our
life with no effort
why shouldn't we now
here's my take on this
quitting diet coke or coke is really
hard
i know because i had a 12 diet coke a
day habit for
i don't know 30 years or something and i
did quit
but it was hard and i'm going to tell
you how
so i'm going to teach you how to stop
your diet coke
habit or coke habit soda habit and
it's not hard if you do it right if you
do it wrong it's pretty hard
and i'll teach you how to do it right
and it goes like this
don't quit anything else at the same
time
it is such a strong addiction at least
that's how i found it to be
not addiction in the scientific term but
you know functionally it's an addiction
that if you if you're trying to let's
say improve your entire diet
anytime you're quitting diet coke that's
a lot to ask of you
right you want to be hungry and also not
have a diet coke
those are two really strong forces to be
fighting at the same time
so i say take two months give yourself a
break on the rest of your diet you know
eat healthy food but don't
um don't obsess over it and just do one
thing
just quit diet coke or coke or soda it
doesn't have to be coca-cola company
just sugary drinks just quit that
in two months you will not only not
crave it
it will look like a chemical experiment
and not even look
like a food beverage item in two months
the way you think of it will completely
change just by not drinking it
you don't have to do anything else just
don't drink it for two months
and you will think it's crazy that
anybody puts that in their body
it won't even look like a beverage
i look at i look at a soda now and i
think oh my god i just feel
sorry for anybody who drinks this stuff
after drinking 12 sodas a day for 30
years right
so i'm the biggest hypocrite in the
world and that's what i'm telling you
the moment you go two months without it
it doesn't look the same when you're
done
completely changes what it is
subjectively
so two months don't do anything else
hard just do that
and here's the extra extra benefit um
you know i like to find the benefit and
of chaos right
whenever there's chaos there's advantage
whenever there's tragedy
there's something some little thing
somebody created to make money
and here's what uh the coca-cola company
did for you
and you should thank them for this
coca-cola just made it the easiest it's
ever been
to stop drinking soda because they
pissed you off
use it use it if you're pissed off
don't waste that do not waste
a good anger employ it
use it when that diet coke's looking at
you saying
drink me drink me
use this anger and say i would love to
drink you
you little freaking bastard but i'm not
because i hate you i hate you use it
the the diet the coca-cola company
made i think a gigantic business mistake
because they made it easier for a third
of the country to quit their product
and it's good for your health if you do
now i'm just
going to quote people who know more than
i do to make that claim that is good for
your
your health if you do so do it
take the good from this which is they
made it easy
uh dr nicole sapphire tweeted on
on these sets of tweets and she said the
pandemic side an unhealthy diet
contributes to approximately
678 000 deaths each year
with diabetes heart disease and obesity
making people vulnerable to covenant 19.
and this number is much larger than 22
20 20 because of the the pandemic
670 000 people here dying from
basically eating themselves to death you
know that's the co-morbidity that puts
them
in a vulnerable position so
let's get healthy i i want everybody who
watches
this live stream to be healthier
than the average just just take the tips
and
put together a system that works for you
all right let's talk about the uh
floyd trial so there was something
interesting that came out of that
um you know i've been i've been telling
you that the defense
for a shaven they'd be missing they'd be
missing the most obvious play
if they don't challenge the quality of
video evidence
all right um you want to
you want to challenge the idea that just
because you think you saw it with your
own eyes on video
that doesn't mean anything because video
lies
so the ver the point that video lies and
lies a lot
and lies easily it has to be
communicated to the
to the jury because if the jury sits
there and thinks well it's on video
i saw it with my own eyes it's over so
the defense i'm going to give them a
they get an a-plus for the following
move apparently they had some camera
angles
in which it showed that shaven's uh knee
at some point we don't know how often
during the nine minutes we don't know
how often this was
but at some point shaven's uh knee was
actually on the shoulder blade
above the neck and it's very clear in
the photos
but at other times i think he was on the
neck so
the way that i guess the way the lawyer
introduced this was he asked
one of the experts whoever was on stand
if you'd heard of
camera angle bias have you ever heard of
camera angle bias
and i think the witness said no and then
he showed him two photos
side by side one the one you've probably
seen
that looks exactly like the knee is on
his neck and then
another camera angle of the same thing
where it looks like it's on
maybe further back on his shoulder blade
and you and apparently they time stamped
it so you can tell it's the same time
now imagine you're you're in the jury
the entire time you've been watching
these videos so because you've seen them
as part of the trial
the entire time all you saw all you saw
was a knee on the neck and now the
defense says
okay here's a different angle it's not
on the neck
now you might say to yourself but scott
that doesn't matter
because he took his he just took it off
at one point put it back on
it's not really relevant to anything to
which i would say it is relevant to
intent
the the entire the entire argument
is that uh you know he intentionally
put floyd in a dangerous situation not
intentionally killed him
intentionally killed him i think he's a
higher charge but intentionally put him
in a dangerous situation
where if he took his knee off every now
and then that would suggest he was
trying to mitigate the danger
right that he was aware of a situation
who was trying to not kill him
because sometimes he took his knee off
the neck but i think there's other
evidence to suggest that might have been
after he'd already passed out
so he might have been dead by then don't
know that part so the only thing i'll
say is i don't know if the evidence
makes the point the defense wanted to
make because the timing
it might have been too late when the
knee was off but it's a really good play
in terms of persuasion because the
persuasion of it is
that the the jury just learned that they
can't trust their own
eyes regardless of the timing of when
the knee
the knee was on the neck or the shoulder
the lesson is the same
you can't tell by looking at it that's
really good defense
that's really good we'll see what
happens
again for the people who are watching
this i don't
i don't defend shaven i don't defend
matt gates we just talk about the
persuasion element of it and
see if we can learn anything carl
bergstrom who
often tweets about the
virus and statistical truths about it
is warning us that uh we're
misinterpreting
we being the public
excuse me that we're misinterpreting
um what it means to reach herd immunity
and specifically
specifically that herd immunity doesn't
mean that we're
past all the trouble and that the virus
goes away
so herd immunity you should understand
is not the point when you don't have any
more
virus or more deaths herd immunity
is when it doesn't go as fast in other
words it's not a
another pandemic peak coming but the
baseline
the baseline infections could just go
forever
i mean you could just have new babies
being born and being infected
forever so if you think that
getting to herd immunity means oh we're
done
throw away the masks stop the social
distancing
unfortunately it might not mean that now
i'm not
i'm not telling you that we're going to
wear masks forever i don't think we will
but we
the cough has to be a technique somebody
says no just woke up
and i got a little allergies at the
moment um
so um here's what i would add to this
i'm i'm less less concerned because the
weirdness of this virus
is that we might be able to vaccinate
basically a hundred percent of the
people who would die
so if the uh it's not a dry cough don't
worry
uh i don't have code
um so i'm gonna disagree with carl
bergstrom
even though he's about a hundred times
smarter than i am on
the topic i'm disagreeing and the only
thing i'm gonna
add is that i think this virus is not
like any other virus
because you actually could you could
vaccinate 100 of the people who might
die from it
nothing would stop you from doing that
all right so what happens if 100
of the people who are vulnerable or
something like it
get vaccinated do you care if the rest
of the people get it
i don't know i don't know if you care
now you got the long-haul problem but
isn't the long-haul problem probably
uh you know even that people seem to get
over it
