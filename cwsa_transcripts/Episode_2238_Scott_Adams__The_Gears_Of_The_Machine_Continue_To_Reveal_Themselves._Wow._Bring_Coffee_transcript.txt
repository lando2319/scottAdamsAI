[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
while it lasts
uh this is coffee with Scott Adams and
if you'd like to take this experience up
to a level that I don't think people can
even understand all you need is a cup of
glass I take a Chelsea style the canteen
geographlowska vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dopamine the end of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous hip it
happens now go
well there's all kinds of stuff
happening in the world
all kinds of stuff
um we may have an answer to why are we
so dumb
you know people are always confused how
did they build the pyramids and we
wouldn't know how to do it today with
their tools
anything maybe they were just smarter
maybe we're getting Dumber
well there's new uh
report scientific report that male mice
that consumed aspartame
the sweetener that's in a lot of drinks
for example soft drinks I had offspring
that demonstrated spatial learning and
memory deficits
so basically
aspartame made by stupid
aspartame
now am I wrong that that would explain
everything we see
it would explain everything
actually everything
now I don't think it's true by the way
because studies on mice are not you know
they don't often translate to actually
human beings so and studies in general
studies in general are unreliable and
you know maybe it was made by some
company that competes with soft drinks
so I wouldn't trust any part of that
however the only thing I want to say
about this is it gives me a new thing to
say to the trolls
you know when the trolls come in and say
something dumbass thing you say
are you enjoying your soda
and that's all
how's your soda
that's all I'm gonna say
all right so the theme of today's uh
live stream is who's really in charge
who's running everything or who's trying
to run everything is it the
open Society Soros the Sorrows running
everything
is it the world economic forum
is that as many of as many anti-semitic
people are telling me every day a
gigantic Jewish conspiracy
is it the elites
is it the elites
is it the Deep state is the Deep State
also the elites who are also George
Soros who are also the wef who are also
part of a big Jewish conspiracy
or is it the cartels in the CIA
so we're going to look at those theories
and see which ones hold
number one
if it were a Jewish conspiracy
do you think that they would open the
borders
do you think that do you think there's
some way a Jewish conspiracy could be
furthered by opening the borders
the answer is obviously no
obviously no
obviously
so whatever is happening at the borders
has nothing to do with any kind of a
Jewish conspiracy because why why would
anybody want to destroy the United
States
the biggest military benefactor or the
biggest military support of Israel
that doesn't make sense
so we're going to discard that one as
obviously not true based on observation
now as I've been reminded oh 50
times this morning there are many Jewish
leaders
guess what
all of our leaders have good educations
pretty much all of them
so are you surprised that people who are
well educated are more likely to be
leaders
I'm not
all right we'll talk about some of the
others question number one as part of
context for this
um my understanding is that the reason
there's so many migrants or immigrants
coming in is because they can take
advantage of the Asylum laws not all of
them but most of the ones coming through
the regular ports they say oh I'm
applying for Asylum and then our laws
are so inefficient that they can end up
basically staying here forever even if
they're they never were legitimately
uh in danger
now
why don't we change that
and the answer is because the argument
is that the current situation is better
than what we could change it to
but who exactly did that analysis
who did the analysis
that letting this number of people in
claiming that their Asylum Seekers who
who did the analysis that that saves
more lives than it costs
because the implication of the Asylum
rules
are that it might it might save actual
Asylum Seekers which would be good but
how many per year
how many Asylum Seekers went from pretty
much would have been dead you know let's
say statistically we're not talking
about any individual but statistically
how many of the Asylum Seekers who came
to the United States would have been you
know killed or victimized had they
stayed where they were
or go into another country
does anybody know
see if going private gets rid of that
troll
does anybody know how many Asylum
Seekers act like numbers not percentage
forget about percentages just raw
numbers what would you guess
what's your guess of the number of
people who are saved by the Asylum
program
a hundred a year
what would you guess maybe 100 a year
how many women got raped on the way to
the Border this week
probably more than 100.
how many people died trying to be part
of this big Asylum
Mass migration
probably more than were saved by Asylum
if the point of Asylum is to save people
wouldn't you expect that there would be
at least a little bit of a hand waving
toward an analysis this says if we keep
doing what we're doing we're saving X
number of people
but because it also obviously encourages
Mass Asylum Seekers who may not be
legitimate you know how many people die
because of that
don't you think we have a right to know
and how do you make a decision if you
don't know if you don't know if if you
don't know if the Asylum rules are
making something better and you don't
know that they're making it worse what
what do all decision makers do in that
case
there's one right way to go
now you don't guess
if you can't tell if a Thing If a thing
is really expensive
and it's really expensive to let people
in that's obvious if a thing is really
expensive you don't do it unless you're
pretty sure it works
everybody gets that right you don't
affirmatively do a thing that's really
expensive if you don't have pretty clear
evidence that it probably works where
would be the evidence that this probably
works
none
none the most basic the most basic
analysis that anybody would do is is
this thing we're doing that costs a lot
of money
once they get in you know they have to
be supported but it costs a lot of money
and it's an affirmative thing
it's not just you know some default
thing that came to us we're
affirmatively doing this
without any information if it makes
things better or worse
and what does your intuition tell you
does your common sense and intuition
tell you that it is saving more lives
than it's taking if you count the fact
that somebody who gets violently raped
is never the same
so what can you conclude about this the
one thing you can conclude for sure
is that it's not based on kindness It's
not based on any sense of what's good
for people so far would you say that's
100 obvious
because if they were trying to save
lives they would make a case that this
saves more lives than the alternative
but the complete absence of that along
with the fact that it seems kind of
obvious that it's costing more lives
than saving I mean just observationally
commonsensically what it feels like
without the without the analysis it
feels like it's massively worse
what we're doing
so under those conditions can you could
you honestly tell yourself that the
reason the borders are as open as they
are is because we did the analysis and
we're doing what's good for people
now now you couldn't you couldn't that's
not even slightly feasible that that's
why this is happening right
so if it's not because of the stated
reasons being good to people
what is it
it's something else
maybe we can determine whether something
else is with a little bit more context
here's some context Michael wolf a
author who likes to write provocative
books about public figures among other
things
he's got a he's got this book coming out
it's a hit piece on Fox News
now do you think that this hit piece on
Fox News is going to be
credible
you think it'll be incredible
let me just give you a sense of how not
credible it is if you try to wrap your
head around what I'm going to say
because you're going to have to sit down
for this
I swear to God your head is going to
fall off when I tell you what happens
next
all right it's a it's a hip piece by a
very Democrat left-leading guy Michael
wolf
and it's a hit piece against Fox News
now hold that in your head
Democrat writes a hit piece about Fox
News
on CNN the biggest competitor of Fox
News there is a opinion piece by Oliver
Darcy
now Oliver Darcy writes a lot of opinion
pieces that are you know anti-gop
anti-rite kind of stuff now the whole
thou hold everything you had so far
it's a hit piece by a Democrat
against Fox News
who is the biggest competitor
of CNN
and the CNN opinion piece person tells
you
that you should ignore this book
because it's going to be a non-credible
piece of
that's from the CNN opinion guy
the CNN opinion guy just defended Fox
News before the book hits
before the book ends he says this guy is
so non-credible
that he's not even going to support it
against his biggest competition
that's how bad it is
now tell yourself do you think you live
in a world where the hip pieces or
something about the news or something
that you need to know
now
the hip pieces are all going after the
economic model mostly the advertising
model of anybody who's a Critic
of the left
so the first this is a hit piece that is
so obviously hippies
that to his credit Oliver Darcy who very
clearly has a you know a left-leading
bias and there's nothing wrong with that
so there's nothing wrong with having a
bias you know we all have it but
here's a
my sense of what he wrote is that he's
actually offended by being part of an
industry that does this stuff
I think he's actually offended by it
even just being part of this industrial
 complex
that is something that's really notable
so congratulations Oliver Darcy now
there may be more of the story that I
know about you know maybe that's some
personal problem that would be funny if
the whole thing is they have some
personal beef but uh on the surface it
looks like he's uh just being useful
telling you the truth
all right uh attorney general Garland
testified would you be surprised to know
that it looked like he perjured himself
according to Thomas Massey
um and that it looks like he lied and
avoided everything and something deeply
deeply is wrong
that's I I could get into the details of
who asked what and how he avoided the
questions and whatever but the bottom
line is he did everything you would do
if you were guilty and you didn't know
how to hide it
just everything you do he could not have
looked more guilty or less like somebody
who's working for the public
now just hold that in your mind the
Attorney General doesn't even appear to
be trying to hide the fact that there's
something going on here that's not cool
all right
um
Trump came out about against the
continued resolution that would keep the
government open by funding it the same
way it's been funded before without any
changes and it's just a way to Kick the
Can down the road so they don't have to
come up with a real budget
um but
if you're against the continuing
resolution you're against the budget
or at least the budget that would keep
the government open temporarily
and Trump says
no money as long as you have a
weaponized government and the borders
are open
to which I say okay
yeah I think the very minimum for
funding our government is they have to
close the border
I would be against
I'm against any funding of a government
that's not doing anything for me
if you're not going to actually work for
me close the border why would I pay you
Trump is completely right there's
absolutely no reason to fund the
government we should let it crash just
let the whole government crash
it's better
because they want paychecks and they
want jobs and stuff just stop paying
them see what happens
uh yeah and yes I know there'd be
gigantic repercussions but not as
gigantic as the alternative the open
borders are way worse than a crash in
the government
if we crash the government let's say we
were completely helpless to foreign
attack
that's okay
compared to what's happening right now
if you want to make us completely
vulnerable to foreign attack
I'm okay with that because we're we're
past the point
of any safe options there are no safe
options you're gonna have to do
something dangerous
and closing the government is pretty
dangerous but probably have to do it
doesn't mean we will but we should
even actor John Cusack is blasting the
Democrats for being a bunch of fascists
I'm not making that up
you know John Cusack is sort of the
Rob Reiner of
of sloppy looking actors
um who's you know one of the biggest
critics of the Republicans but he just
you know full throated just said
the Democrats are basically fascists
they're just coordinated with with the
big companies to screw the middle class
didn't pull any punches
yep so that's happening now you've also
seen that even you know uh Morning Joe
and the most Lefty of the lefties are
starting to come around and saying wait
a minute wait a minute why are we
opening the borders and not fighting
crime anymore
like they're starting to understand that
their side there's something deeply
wrong and they don't even know what it
is
maybe we can figure it out
um
well you know even
um
Cusack even went after Obama by name
created the conditions for fascism
that's pretty direct and he's right
so Dave Portnoy
uh made some news today I guess he's
doing some kind of piece of pizza
related festival or event
and the Washington Post called his
advertisers the event
said that he is a misogynist who's done
lots of sketchy things and they want to
talk to them
to get their comment about why they
would advertise for such a sketchy
person
so Dave Portnoy calls the
the reporter who first denies that
something like that happened
and then he read the actual reporter's
message who then did not deny that it
happened but said oh well yeah we were
going to talk to you
so Portnoy says could you show me the
article
and then you know I would talk to you
about whether that's right or wrong and
they say oh no we can't show you the
article
because of journalistic blah blah blah
explain to me what vile what
journalistic principle would be violated
by showing Dave Portnoy the article
before it runs so that he could fact
check it or at least tell you what his
impression is to each of the claims tell
me anything that would be a violation of
journalistic integrity
nothing
there's nothing that would stop you from
doing that most of the journalists won't
do that by the way that's something you
know I've asked for in the past but they
just laugh at you no they're not going
to show it to you
even if it's about you
they're not going to show to you do you
know who doesn't do that
uh Fortune Magazine didn't do that
when Fortune Magazine would do a piece
about me the the uh the reporter would
write the piece
and then separately a completely
different person would call me and on
the phone read everything in the piece
that was sort of directly about a fact
about me and say is this true they would
even check
do you have the the date of Birthright
did you really say this quote
um did you make this much money are you
in this business
do you know why they don't do that
anymore
well newspapers didn't do it in the
first place
now I don't something's happening with
Fortune at the moment it's different
ownership I think but back in those days
they were actually quite serious about
getting the story right
so they would make sure that you
answered now fortune didn't show you the
story
so that is actually a journalistic
practice they won't show you the story
but they did the next best thing
which is a red like every detail that
was a directly a fact
and they asked you to respond to it
how many times did I have to correct
facts when the fact Checkers asked me to
correct them how many times were there
substantial facts that would have been
wrong if they had masked
100 of the time
100 of the time
there's something in the fact checking
that's important and completely wrong
100 yeah now what happens to a story
where no fact Checker does that
it's guaranteed to be wrong
I've never seen one that was right about
a public figure in very important ways
but is that what's Happening Here is
this just a hit piece
yeah it's a little more than that isn't
it
because the way they it went about it is
they sent a a message to the advertisers
to chill them from wanting to be
Associated is that what a hit piece is
usually the hip piece does the damage
after it's published
here they were very directly trying to
damage Port noise operation
without the article just going right
after the people who who give him
advertising to chill them to think do
you want to be in a story about in The
Washington Post
this as you're associating with us who
they call the misogynist
now do you see the op
the op is to go after every dissenting
voice
after their business model
so my business model was removed Tucker
Carlson's was removed Russell Brand was
removed now they're going after Portnoy
they're going to remove his business
model of course the entire Trump
business was you know kneecapped
by the entire process
so so you can see one after another
that the the Press
which some say is uh managed by the CIA
some people would say the Washington
Post is owned by the CIA or influenced
by it
and the Press is trying to destroy a
citizen
because that's not journalism and when
asked why they were even writing the
article they said it's because he's
interesting
that's why the Washington Post writes an
article about an individual and destroys
his business model because he's
interesting
stop saying I'm wrong and then agreeing
with me all right
so a local somebody says I'm wrong but
then they're agreeing with me no they
didn't show the article in advance in
Fortune the fact Checkers asked me facts
but it is true that I've had journalists
for smaller Publications who offered to
show me the entire text
just to make sure it was right
so both have happened but it would be
uncommon it would be uncommon to show
the subject the article if you're a big
publication like the Washington Post
that would be uncommon I've never heard
of it probably happened but it would be
uncommon
all right
so that's a clear example of uh a hip
piece that's beyond a hit piece because
they're actually trying to destroy his
business before they even publish the
article
have you ever seen anything like that
before
have you ever seen anything like that
unbelievable now we also know that the
UK
has asked YouTube and Tick Tock to
demonetize Russell Brand
because he's accused of things not
convicted not proven but simply accused
does that strike you as something that's
just a normal activity of of the
government is that just a normal
oh it was I'm sorry it was Rumble they
were trying to get to demonetize and
Rumble and Tick Tock thank you for the
correction because YouTube already
demonetizes
now
do you think it's a normal and proper
use of the government
to ask American companies to demonetize
somebody who's only been accused
does that sound like a you know want
something they should spend their time
on
can you see that this is very directly
going after the the economics and
business model of anybody who has a
dissenting opinion it's obvious right
but who would do such a thing
now you also know that Tick Tock um the
reason it's still legal is because
there's a American I think he's American
billionaire who funds Congress
so you know that that part's just
illegitimate
um why is fentonline uh why is the
Border open
tell me who would benefit from an open
border
well let me say it as clearly as
possible
whoever is in charge of our border
is in charge of the country would you
say that's true whoever's in charge of
the border is who's in charge of the
country
because you wouldn't be able to be in
charge of the Border unless you were
also in charge of the country
who who lives inside the boundaries of
America who would open the Border
like what kind of a high-functioning
person who actually understands the
world now I'm not talking about Louis CK
because he would open the Border but
if we're being honest he hasn't really
looked into it
yeah he's not one of the people in
charge so you don't have to worry about
him but people who actually understand
what's happening who in the world would
open it who lives inside the border and
the answer is nobody
there's nobody who lives in America who
would be okay with opening the Border
you just wouldn't do it
but there is somebody outside of America
would want to do it who would that be
who lives outside of America and would
want to open the Border even at the
severe risk of what would happen to
America
trying to use that
and who does China work with
the cartels
the cartels want the open border most
and they work with China
so that you know they're connected but
mostly the cartels
who uh
did did you ever wonder why
our CIA can overthrow almost any
government in Central and South America
if they want to and have
um I'll deal with the anti-semitics so
all the anti-semitic people who are
yelling Jew Juju I will I will answer
your questions but saying it over and
over it won't actually change the fact
that it's stupid
right so a lot of what you think is
anti-Semitic is just stupid people who
can't do pattern recognition
right the fact that a lot of Jewish
people have good jobs is not telling you
what you think it's telling you
because you've got a theory that there's
a Jewish conspiracy to do something that
would be the worst thing that could ever
happen to uh Jews anywhere in the entire
world which is destroyed the economy of
the United States do you really think
that there there's even one
like legitimate high-powered Jewish
leader in the United States who wants
the economy of the United States
destroyed
you have to come up with a theory
you're gonna have to come up with a
theory that actually makes sense
and the we want to destroy all of our
own money and and the people who protect
us the most
for our benefit
come up with a coherent Theory so first
you have to describe it coherently these
are the people
here's what they're doing and here's why
that's good for them you haven't done
that right you've told me the people
but you haven't told me why it's good
for them to destroy their own biggest
assets
if you if you can pull that together no
don't just shout Jewish names right and
I'm kind of intentionally triggering
people into cognitive dissonance right
now so if it looks like I'm pushing this
too hard it's because I'm I'm watching
the cognitive dissonance so what you
should see is a bunch of accusations
about me because nobody can answer the
question all they can do is shout words
uh Zionism
uh Larry Larry Finkel right
go ahead just just shout words to show
us how your cognitive dissonance is
turning out
just just try to make your case but
prove to us that you can't do anything
except shout oh Jews about oh go ahead
oh great reset great reset
Weimar Weimar Republic so that's a
pretty good argument oh there's good
Scott adamstein got a good comment
good comment
Soros Soros oh it all makes sense now
Soros
no I'm gonna I'm gonna play this out a
little bit longer
so bear with me because all the people
who who have been where'd you go
where'd you go all the people who were
sure that they had this all figured out
it's a giant Jewish conspiracy and I ask
you one simple question what
would be in it for them to destroy
America their greatest asset meaning a
lot of their money would be here as well
as the military that you know helps
defend Israel and everything else
just just describe your theory right or
leave me the alone you can go
believe it but don't start just shouting
it at me if you don't even have a way to
connect your own dots connect your own
 dots first and then come at me
and I'll I'll look at it all right if
you've got a theory that I have not
considered I'll look at it but it has to
be coherent don't give me an incoherent
Theory where people want to hurt
themselves oh I want power so I can
screw my own people that's your
Theory
all right going moving on
um
so uh let's talk about the Ukraine war
no actually I want to talk about the uh
the Border some more
um what do you see it's what do you say
it's fair to say
that the cartels must be in control of
the open border
do you think that that do you think
observation
there's only one alternative
because it's not the American people and
certainly not you know our government
now let me ask you this question if the
CIA can overthrow
every government in South and Central
America at will
but they can't overthrow the cartels
the cartels are just a government within
the government that's the only thing
they can't overthrow
is is that is that your theory is your
theory that the CIA has all this power
but for some reason ah they just can't
get any purchase with the cartels
cartels just keep growing keep getting
stronger and our our CIA just helpless
nothing they can do
the only thing you could possibly
conclude is that the CIA is either owned
by
or working with the cartels
now I'm not inventing this theory on my
own obviously there have been books
written about it there's plenty you can
research on your own but I would say
there's no conclusion you could reach
other than that they're working together
and it's only the cartel who wants the
Border open they're making a lot of
money and it would be a play to conquer
the United States
I think that cartels have an actual
legitimate possibility of Conquering the
United States
because if we're not doing anything to
stop them
and they're working with the CIA they
would have everything they need to
conquer the country proper
so they wouldn't be maybe maybe they
would be on the same
page for some things but they would have
different incentives you know they're
not really trying to accomplish the same
thing but if they work together and it
looks like they are they would be able
to control the United States
so I don't have proof that that's
happening it's just the only thing that
makes sense with what we see now you're
going to say what about George Soros
George Soros is the open borders guy
George Soros is funding people who are
behind it right so it's all George Soros
who owns George Soros
do you think that the Soros family is
acting like they're independent people
with opinions and they're they're
explaining them really well
so when they say the open borders
they've made their argument in a way
that you and I can look at and go huh I
disagree with that but that's a well
that's a well-explained argument it's
just I disagree with it
no no the only thing that would explain
the Soros activities of letting
criminals out of jail
for drug charges especially and opening
the borders is that the Soros are owned
by the CIA
it's got to be a CIA operation and it's
got to be a cartel operation because
nobody who lives in the United States
would do this Alexander Soros lives in
the United States
he's a resident of the United States
nobody who lives here would open the
borders
nobody who is Rich and lives here unless
they were under duress would do what
they're doing
so the most reasonable explanation of
the Soros funding and activities is that
it's under duress
now I'm not saying that's true because I
don't have direct evidence I'm just
saying it's the only thing that makes
sense because I've been asking for years
literally years online and other places
can somebody explain
what is the sorrow's point of view where
any of this makes sense and the answer
is there is none there is no argument
that actually argues why this works
none
so obviously they're doing something
that no nobody would do willingly
nobody would willingly
let their country be you know destroyed
by you know un unfettered immigration
literally nobody would do that
so you can't assume that thesauros are
in charge of America
because they're not doing something
that's good for the sorosis or anybody
else except the cartels
so I'm going to guess that the Soros
family is compromised just based on
observation
so just so I don't get sued I'm just
saying there's no other explanation
I don't have direct evidence there's
just no other explanation
and what about the wef I think the wef
is a head fake to make you think that
they're behind a lot of stuff they might
actually be influencing things like
climate change a little bit or something
but uh I would go with Elon musk's take
that it's a club for rich people to meet
each other
and to signal that they're awesome and
stuff I think the wef is just a big head
fake to make you think that that's the
problem when the real problems the
cartels
that's what it looks like
um
how about the Ukraine war do you think
that's all legitimate and the money that
we're spending there is because it's a
valid concerns the United States or does
it seem like there's some kind of
democrat and CIA Biden thing going on
here that we don't know about
it looks much more like
it looks a lot more
like it's just some dirty thing we don't
know about
so that's all it looks like
all right
if we have open borders which apparently
we do
what are the odds that we also have Fair
elections
what country is so owned by somebody
outside the country that they would open
their borders
and yet they would have Fair elections
how does that even make sense
if there's somebody who can control the
country so much they can make them open
their borders
they would certainly have enough control
to control the elections directly or
indirectly you know I don't mean that
the elections are rigged in some
specific you know criminal way but they
would have enough influence to make sure
they got their candidate one way or
another
yeah so I would say that open borders is
proof that the election system is
compromised but again I have no direct
evidence of that it's just there's no
way these two things can coexist there's
only one explanation
so the gears of the machine are becoming
obvious it looks like this it looks like
the CIA and the cartels are working
together because otherwise the CIA would
have stopped the cartels by now
they clearly have the ability
so if they haven't done it by now and
they're not even close
they're working together
and the cartels evidently control the
Democrats
because there's no explanation for open
borders
there really isn't
um
and we know that the Democrats in the
CIA collectively control the media
I would say that's an established fact I
don't need to support that with any
sources I think you all know that and
then of course the media is what
controls the voters Minds
to me it looks like Soros is just the
bank for the cartels
I think it's just the bank
because the cartels are the ones who
want people out of jail and the cartels
who want chaos and the cartels who want
the borders open so I don't think it's a
coincidence that everything the Soros is
funding that doesn't seem to make sense
is also good for the cartels
so I would guess that the CIA probably
working with the cartels of compromised
Soros and just using them as a bank
um
and that's my take
so
can you see the gears of the machine at
this point
yeah
so what whoever and whatever is running
the country
um it's not what you thought it was
unless you were pretty conspiratorial
now I'm not going to claim that my take
is right
I'm not going to say it's right
I'm saying that there's no other
explanation that I can think of
if anybody can come up with a better
explanation of what we observe
let me know normally normally what
happens is there are people with
different arguments let's take abortion
abortion is a situation I think I
completely understand
because there are people who
legitimately have different opinions and
it looks to me like that's all that's
happening
would you agree the abortion question it
looks like there's nothing but a
difference of opinion and people are
fighting as hard as they can to get
their way nothing mysterious about it
but when you look at the open borders
and the letting criminals and the jail
and the destruction of the Cities
there's no way that's accidental
it's not you know it might be a side
effect of some other thing we don't see
but give me any explanation
for what we're observing that doesn't
involve the cartels working with the CIA
I can't think of any
now if if you're coming in late and
yelling it's the Jews uh I've already
mocked you into silence so you should
talk to the people I've already mocked
in silence if any if anybody wants to
come up with some kind of coherent idea
why one group of people would want to
destroy their own wealth and Military
protection
I'll listen to it that would be quite a
story
but if you've got nothing
that gives you a coherent idea about the
Jews running the world
just because a lot of them have good
jobs
you're gonna have to try a little bit
harder than that at least I've given you
a coherent follow the money prediction
follow the money
says that there is now some Jewish idea
to open the Border that would never be a
follow-of-the-money scenario that would
be anti-follow the money
so follow the money definitely says CIA
cartel
is a business that's being protected
clearly
all right
um
cheap labor now cheap labor doesn't
explain it that's not what we're seeing
now don't go with it's not all the Jews
but many Jews you still do not have a
coherence even an idea of what you're
suggesting
it there's no some people who are
destroying themselves
um Addison
all right what you're asking is not on
the topic
so you can't change my mind by saying
that there's an effect on the culture
because that would be every group has an
effect on the culture
so just admit that you don't have any
Theory
that would make sense
um your weird little example of Gulag
guards
is not really persuasive on this topic
why did the CIA want to destroy America
the CIA
probably just wants to control America
and some chaos might be just what they
need
okay
all right
uh
I guess we're 200 character limit here
no you just the character limit would be
no problem you just have to complete the
picture
and then maybe I would have questions so
for example you have to explain to me
why destroying your own money and your
own military is actually a secret
advantage
and that wouldn't take more than a
sentence or two it would be like oh it
actually makes it stronger to destroy
the military
I mean I'd ask some questions but at
least you tell me what you're thinking
or you might say uh they found a way to
make money on the chaos
to which I say oh interesting how do
they do that
right so you don't have to explain every
detail but give me give me a flavor give
me a taste give me any sense that you
have a coherent thought
and then we could discuss it but if you
can't give me the Baseline coherence
don't ask me to talk about the details
open border is more money to government
programs well at this point nobody's
thinking that way because the government
programs are overwhelmed
yeah I don't believe that
Louis CK said open the borders and it
might be hard at first but then we just
adjust and it'd be fine
there you can't have any kind of
economic growth without um borders
right borders are a baseline requirement
for economic stability period
nobody's ever figured out a way around
that now that doesn't mean a wall but at
the very least you have to prevent
people who have less than you from
flooding your Rich situation and ruining
it because what what uh entrepreneurs
are going to stay around
in a country that's being destroyed by
immigration they'll simply go where
there's a border anybody who has money
is going to go where there is a border
and that would include leaving the
United States if they had to
yeah I don't think the adding voter
numbers argument is explaining enough
it doesn't explain enough
all right
should New York City take down this
George Washington statues oh I don't
care
uh
no I don't think that China is my my
observation is that China is a Helper
but not the big Power
because I don't think China could keep
our border open
I don't think they have that power
but I think the cartel does
with the CIA so it's hard for me to
imagine that the CIA would be working
with China
but it seems obvious that there that
they work with the cartels because they
have other benefits from the cartels
uh convergence of interests and to some
extent
all right
Iran has a good border
that's true
so do you think
JFK was not a fan of the CIA yeah I'm
sure he wasn't especially after they
killed him
important always follow up with the
reporter was canceled so if you listen
to uh Dave portnoy's conversation with
the Washington Post reporter it's pretty
fascinating you should watch it you
should listen to all of it that was just
wrapped
but the part I didn't go to the very end
but he was still talking about maybe he
would talk to her why would he talk to
her
that would be crazy it would be crazy to
give her an interview
but maybe just for fun or if he wasn't
recorded himself or something
um
yeah Rupert Murdoch
is stepping back from Fox News
The Clapper Brandon task force yeah
yeah the the fact that Clapper and
Brennan were put on any kind of uh
Homeland task force
that should tell you
that I mean the the fact that they could
even even think that that's okay
is just mind-blowing
all right
uh how do you go after the CIA you don't
I'll probably I'll probably stop talking
about this after today
because if I continue talking about it I
would be shut down
I I and by the way if you don't think
there's a second attack on me being
planned somewhere you I'd be amazed I'm
sure that
there's another attack on me being
planned some kind or another
um
the age of men is over according to Time
Magazine
a big Target yeah well the see the thing
I have working for me is that nobody is
going to believe me
the the type of thing that I suggested
today
is sort of too big for people to hold in
their mind you know I'm not making fun
of anybody's mind I'm saying in general
we can't handle this level of
uh conspiracy theory
so I think I think maybe we just have to
get over the fact that this is what it
is
cool Kenny believes the CIA operation
against me that says I believed in the
vaccines
so by the way I suspect that wasn't
organic
you know the uh the so all of my
opinions on the pandemic were reversed
and then I was criticized by now in
retrospect that looks a little
suspicious doesn't it
yeah many of you believe that I said my
opinions were the opposite of what they
were
which would be the main way to shut me
down
the the main way to shut me down would
be to say that I said the opposite of
what I said on the pandemic
so it looks like a weird coincidence
that that attack came from the right
interesting
attributing what to incompetence well
the CIA is not incompetent over a scale
of decades if you're saying the CIA is
incompetent as stopping the cartels I
would say all evidence suggests that
they're pretty good at overthrowing
stuff
and stop and stuff
so the fact that it's not happening and
nothing like it is happening
is a pretty clear symbol the signal that
is not incompetence that the problem is
seriously
Harry is asking always wanted to know if
you took any influence money on the
pandemic
seriously
now you would only ask that if the CIA
or somebody has brainwashed you into
thinking that my opinions were the
opposite of what they were
nobody would have paid me for my opinion
not the real opinions but the opinions
that somebody told you I have that would
sound weird wouldn't it
so many of you actually have a very
strong belief about something that
didn't happen
you ever wonder about that
do the decency of reading your Super
Chat reply
and now
now I I don't encourage super chats
so I don't like reading them
yeah it must be new
anyway
um
you were all over the place during the
pandemic no Lou I was not all over the
place during the pandemic you have once
again fallen for somebody's propaganda
no the fact that you didn't see all of
my opinions is not me being all over the
place
in fact they were pretty consistent the
whole time
to argue with the chat while you have a
microphone
what do you think the chat is for
uh how many of you thinks that I made a
record a health recommendation on the
pandemic I want to see how dumb you are
this will be a good test how many
believe that I gave you a recommendation
about either the vaccination or the
masks to use them
do you think I recommended that you
should get a vaccination
who thinks I did that
or who thinks I recommended that masks
should be mandated
anybody
well you a bunch of you were were pretty
chatty here
how do you feel watching all of the
comments go by they say they say that
you're hallucinating about my opinion I
mean look at it they're all nose
right so why do you think that I
accepted money to tell people
nothing
to tell them nothing about their health
I told them to take vitamin D
Charles says you persuaded did I
persuaded what
nope never did
Bob I
know all right
vitamin D is horse DM or dewormer
was the teen rapist in the skirt in the
girl's bathroom yeah you know I don't do
the anecdotal crime stuff too much
so
um I think you're all being manipulated
when there's a individual Crime Story
whether it's a George Floyd story
or a Daniel Penny story all of the
individual anecdotal stories or
manipulation
so I don't like to
I don't like to be part of it unless the
story gets so big you can't you can't
help it
all right
you said you were not worried about
mandates and vaccine passwords because
it was a temporary problem it was only a
temporary problem because people were
kicking and screaming if people had
rolled out over similar to your last
days I think we'd be dealing with it and
worse
well you're wrong because I knew that
the complaints is what would stop it
so so you're complaining that my
prediction was accurate
I had an accurate prediction
that the pandemic would not lead to a
permanent state of vaccine passports or
whatever it was temporary and
so was I right or wrong
I
oh well all right the last thing I want
to do is talk about the pandemic so
let's talk about something else is there
any topic I missed
I don't think there's much else going on
right now so I think the big topic is
the demonetization and the shutting up
of people like me
and so I've said what I'm going to say
about that stuff
and probably I'm going to leave it alone
so I can stay alive
literally so you think you live in a
country with free speech
I'm telling you directly I'm not going
to be hitting this topic hard in the
future because I want to stay alive and
the only reason I can do it is because I
know that nobody thinks I can make a
difference
if I were if I had a big enough audience
like a Russell Brand size audience I'd
probably be afraid of getting murdered
but the the smart play in my case
is to let me drop it
and I'm saying directly
I'm going to ease out of the topic it is
what it is I don't what am I going to do
about it am I going to complain about it
and then it will change
nope but at least I'll understand it
um yeah the last thing the the last
thing would be good for anybody who
wanted to shut me up would be to do it
now
because it would validate anything I've
said
so that would be the worst time to do it
so I'm safer than I've ever been safe at
the moment
as long as I get off of this topic I
could probably stay alive
don't be a martyr
oh so this is probably a coincidence
probably a coincidence but just before I
got on I
I saw that cartels were trending
and I thought to myself oh I hope that's
not because of me because I tweeted
about the cartels a bunch of times this
morning and I thought oh God I hope one
of my I hope one of my posts didn't go
viral because I don't want to I don't
want to stick my head up that much
so I clicked on the trending
cartels and now of course the reason
something Trends is because a lot of
people are talking about it right
that's how it trends the trending
doesn't happen on its own a lot of
people talk about it
and then it shows up so I clicked the
thing that showed up as trending and
that was the response I got
that there's that there's no data on
that
now is it was that a bug
if you click it now I think it actually
works
but isn't that kind of a weird bug
because the other trending things
actually gave me results
so I trade I said oh maybe it's the
trending thing doesn't work so I just
clicked another one Boop result
I know
it could be a coincidence
it could be
a lot of coincidences in the world right
now
well I would ask you if you would like
to understand the world
um
posts or not if you try to click my book
it gives you an error down too
I book reframe your brain is uh changing
lives all over the place I keep hearing
from people who have completely
changed their life gotten a raise
fixed their mental health stopped
drinking lost lost weight
all from one book
so whatever it is you're looking to fix
it's the fastest way you can do it if I
would I'm going to make a claim
I'm going to make a claim that my book
gives you the greatest life benefits
with the least amount of work
because the book doesn't require you to
do anything you just read the reframes
that's it ended up it updates your
software
so you don't have to keep a journal you
don't have to go practice something you
don't have to do anything
you just Breeze through a well-written
easy to read book and suddenly your life
will look different now that sounds like
quite a claim doesn't it
that if you just sort of Breeze over
this easy to read book that's kind of
fun anyway that your life will change
but ask anybody who's read it just ask
anybody who's read it did it change your
life or any part of it in a way that's
substantial I'll bet nearly 100 of
people would say yes
there are pictures there are comics
all right that's all for now and I will
talk to you tomorrow or maybe in the man
