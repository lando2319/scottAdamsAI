good morning everybody and welcome to
the best time you ever had in your life
highlight of civilization
probably the well I mean just the most
special moment ever in the history of
the universe and if you'd like to take
it up to levels that are even better
than that even better
no wait you may have seen the white
board behind me yes it's a white board
today
not a white supremacy board just the
color white
but if you'd like to take that
experience up all you need is a cup of
mug or a glass of tanker jealousy style
the canteen Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the hit of the
day you think that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous set
but happens now go
ah
yeah yeah
so
um you might know that Kerry Lake was
not a successful under a legal Challenge
and the latest is that the judge ruled
that there was no special problem with
her claim that 274
000 signatures were checked in two
seconds and then another seventy
thousand in one second
however I'm going to demonstrate that
that's very feasible
I'm going to do that on the Whiteboard
later
do you think I can do it
do you think it's a trick
or do you think I can do
274 well
I can't do them all here but I can prove
it can be done
I'll prove I can be done
does anybody think I can do it
oh I'm going to surprise you
prepare to be red billed
you're going to get a little more red
pill than you were before
but we'll get to that
um
first story is about Bud Light I guess
they're gonna they've offered to buy
backs any of their beer that is unsold
on the shelves so the retailers don't
get bitten too hard
but apparently what they've done is they
took their Bud Light can that I
at least one special promotional can had
uh the trans activist on it and they got
a lot of pushback so they've decided to
make their can they quote
folds of Honor
uh
oh no they've got a program for that for
families have fallen a disabled American
Military members and responders
uh so it's a line of camouflage aluminum
bottles
do you call it an aluminum thing a
bottle
I thought if it's aluminum you call it a
can
do you call it an aluminum bottle
Maybe
um
so here's my take
so they came up with this wonderful idea
or at least a third an outside firm did
to promote Dylan mulvady and then there
was a bunch of pushback so then they
fired or put some people on leave
and now they've come up with a better
marketing idea so now they're gonna wrap
their product around disabled and Fallen
American military service people
I would like to give some marketing
advice
to the Anheuser-Busch company
now
this may be something that they missed
in their all their marketing studies
generally speaking
what you like to do is associate your
product with something that your
customers like
so for example in the old days when the
customers were mostly men they would
associate their beer with uh attractive
women
because I don't know if I need to
connect the dots but there are a lot of
mountain there are a lot of them
who like attractive women
and then they say oh beer attractive
women and some of the some of the good
feelings that they have about one
gets on to the other it's the same
reason that famous sports stars sell
products oh I like Michael Jordan
Michael Jordan has sneakers I kind of
like the sneakers because I like Michael
Jordan so that's that's typically how
marketing works
so if you do it wrong
and you say well most of my customers
have some let's say sub-optable feelings
about the trans community
so I'll associate my product with that
now of course Anheuser-Busch wasn't
really trying to do that it was really
one bottle for one one activist
uh but I got blown up into a bigger
thing than it really was
and so they quickly said oh oh I get it
now if you associate your product with
something that your customers are
uncomfortable with
they will buy fewer units of that
product
so
thankfully they fixed all that
and they've figured out a way to
associate their product with something
that everybody likes
because everybody likes wounded disabled
and dead service people right
wait
wait did they do it again
they did it again did they
they just found a way to associate their
product with the only thing I don't want
to think about all day long
I don't want to spend any moments
thinking about dead Americans
they've actually Associated it with
death
and and I'm going to be I'm going to be
careful how I say this
but it's not exactly victory
I'm going to say it in the most
respectful way I can the people who get
killed in battle
um they may be fighting for The Winning
Side at the end
but they individually got a bad outcome
right I'm not going to say winners or
losers that would be inappropriate but
it's a bad outcome
what what is sadder or worse than dying
or being disabled in a war I mean it's
right up there with the worst things
that could happen
but am I wrong now obviously their
strategy was to make it impossible for
Fox News to mock them
you see what they did right if you watch
Fox News a lot of their commercials
about uh disabled or mostly disabled
veterans
so you know that Fox News is 100 to
their credit they're very much Pro
veterans so that's one of their
strongest points so so Anheuser-Busch
looking for a little Comfort wraps
himself around the one topic
the Fox News can't mock them for
supportive of wounded veterans
except
I got a feeling that associating you
know war deaths with the news makes a
little bit more sense because the news
itself is about you know tense things
than to to associate your feel-good
happy product let's party with you know
death and disability
so
to me it looks like
um by the way
um
I should have warned you that I've got a
low battery warning on my YouTube device
if the YouTube feed cuts out and stays
out for more than say five seconds
the only other place you're going to be
able to watch it
is uh no place actually because I've
already I've already closed down locals
as private so if it goes off for more
than five seconds there's nothing I
could do it means the power went off
all right
it's plugged in but uh I'm not sure it
charges as fast as it uses the charge
it's plugged in it's plugged in
I like the fact that you thought that
that was a good suggestion hey your
device is running out of power what to
do what to do
I wonder if you thought of this
have you thought of plugging it in
now what I love about that suggestion is
that you thought there was some
reasonable possibility that I had not
considered that option
I like that about you
you have a low opinion of me
and I think that's appropriate
I I've been spending years trying to
cultivate a low opinion of myself and I
think that you've caught on so good for
you
all right um
here's my hypothesis
well I wouldn't call it that
um
for those of you who happen to be white
people
are you getting tired of being called
White supremacists
is it starting to feel like it's not
just you know somebody got it wrong or
it's just not normal politics it's now
the n-word isn't it
white supremacy is basically the end
word for white people
and I think it's time that we start
treating it like that
now I'm against all forms of violence
no violence
so this is just an expression of how I
feel
but not a recommendation
I think that if I heard a story
about a well let me let me back up a
little bit let's say you were on a jury
trial
and the problem was that somebody
punched another person
because the person who got punched was
using the n-word in the worst way
and let's say black American punched him
in the face then got arrested
and I'm on I'm on the jury
and the defense is hey he kept using the
n-word those are fighting words and I
just punched him in the face
if you were on the jury
would you have
A Little Bit of Sympathy for the the
puncher
I feel like I would I feel like I'd have
a a tough time
finding in favor of the one who got
punched because that person was causing
trouble
right the person who causes the trouble
and then the trouble comes to them
I don't know I don't I don't feel no I
get that the law is very clear the
person who does the punching would be
guilty of the crime I get that right and
my job as a jurist
my job would be to you know follow the
law not not make it up on my own but I'm
just telling you if I sat in if I sat in
the jury my sympathy would be with the
puncher
anybody does anybody disagree
that's where my sympathy would be I
would say yeah that was somebody who
absolutely needed to get punched in the
face you have my blessing
right
now I don't see a lot of agreement here
but I'll just go on with my point
uh no from a legal from a legal
perspective we all agree
right there's no disagreement from a
legal perspective and if you're against
violence there's no disagreement that
you should not have any
I'm just saying how I would feel
I would just feel some sympathy
for the person who essentially was the
victim of the original attack and then
just fought back a little bit too hard
so now reverse it
reverse it somebody calls you a white
supremacist
and you punch him in the face
same thing
my sympathy was with the puncher in both
cases is not even racial
it's just if somebody starts a fight
with you with words and you punch him in
the face
it's got to be illegal you know I don't
I don't want to live in a world where
that's legal
but my sympathy is with the puncher and
I think it's time that we uh are a
little bit more honest about it if the
n-word is out of bounds and I think you
should be I'm completely on board with
there are some words that are just
fighting words and I think white
supremacy
supremacist has now achieved that status
it didn't used to be it used to be you
know you're talking about some outliers
and you know white people would talk
about those white supremacists the same
way
but once you're once you start saying
that oh it's systemic racism and just
being white makes you a white
supremacist or a white supremacist
supporter that's uh too far
that's too far
and if somebody punches you in the face
for using those terms I support the
puncher
but I don't support violence I just have
some some sympathy for them
all right
um
here's a funnier story
Japan's I guess is the biggest nuclear
plant in the world
in Japan and they were getting ready to
reopen
but things got delayed because one of
the employees had a a bunch of documents
that are some somehow highly secretive
and important and he put them on top of
his car
before he got in his car to drive away
and all the secret documents blew off
the top of his car
and there were a lot of them and they
were being like picked up by people and
they're trying desperately to get the
documents back
and for some reason and the story was a
little unclear about this for some
reason that's delaying the opening of
the plant
now I of course go immediately to the
Dilbert filter on this
and I'm wondering about how the meetings
went
so uh
so Bob
got a little problem uh we were really
hoping to open the biggest nuclear power
plant in the entire world
but you put those documents on your roof
and that was bad
first of all you shouldn't have had
those documents the second of all don't
put them on the roof and try to drive
do not do that
I feel like that's going to come up in
that employee's performance review am I
right
yeah now I would like to give you one of
the best pieces of advice
that I've ever given in my life
and I'm going to say it three times
the same way because once is not enough
the top of your car is not for temporary
storage of any item
the top of your car is not for temporary
storage of any items
the top of your car is not for temporary
storage of any items
there
I hope that helps you
because you've all had that experience
right you've got something in your hand
or maybe both hands
and you got to open the door
you put your cup of coffee on top of the
car
never
don't ever not in any circumstance ever
ever
put anything on top of your car
because you're gonna forget it
don't put your keys up there your wallet
your coffee or your sensitive nuclear
energy documents
if I can teach you that one thing
now I I have a similar rule for uh
phones and wallets I'm going to share
those
your wallet if you're a guy do you have
a wallet
uh
do young people have wallets
I don't even know if other people have
wallets there's anything anymore or is
that just like a boomer thing now
some do some do all right but
if you if you take your wallet out of
your pants
you should have a rule that there's one
or possibly only two places you could
put it down
that's the rule so my wallet can either
be in my pocket and it can only be in
one pocket ever
in any other pocket and never my wallet
will never be in a separate Place such
as you know in a in a bag or something
so the wallet can only be in your back
right pocket
and when I take it out there's one and
only one place I can put it which is on
my you know dresser in my closet
it's the only place it can be
right now there are sometimes there's
some reason to take it out so I have one
other place I'll put it but if I'm
looking for my wallet
it's either in the pants that I took off
it's on my dresser or it's in that one
other place I allow myself to put it
that's it
now here's my rule with my phone
you ready for a phone rule
if you put your phone down on any item
you cannot put it down upside down
because that could make it invisible
depending on the color of your case
it'll make your phone invisible compared
to being up screen up
and you can never put it in an obscure
place
in other words if I'm in my closet
sometimes I'll have all these closet
shelves and sometimes I'll absolutely
absent-mindedly put my phone on just a
closet shelf
because I'm not thinking I will never
find that phone
I'll never find it
so I could only put my phone on a large
uncluttered surfaces face up
do you know how much time that's saved
me over the course of my life
the number of times that that has helped
me it's like okay it's only can be in
one place a large surface with no
clutter and I'll look and they'll be
there it is it's on a large surface with
no clutter
yeah calling yourself that works
sometimes all right well that was it
diversion you didn't need
there's a new form of AI that's going to
work on the dark web so they trained it
on the dark web so it would be more
optimized for that but that's not the
story
uh although that's a big enough story
that the dark web will have an AI
component to it but here's the name they
gave to the AI that only works in the
dark web
dark bird
at the end dark Bert
now the question I ask is
were they working on this before I got
disgraced
because it's not an accident that it
sounds like Dilbert right
do you think that's that's not a
coincidence is it
looks like they have that in their mind
they just called the dark Bert
maybe I know
hard to know
but there it is
um
DeSantis continues to do things are
making
conservatives happy
so he's ending pronouns in Florida
schools
so no more pronouns
now I didn't look at the details but I
believe that means you just have to call
everybody hey you hey
no more pronouns
but probably if I read deeper into the
story it would be that you can still do
you know he him they probably just
limited it to the the two forums which
would be a better idea than than just
hey you
well all right
um
I don't know do you think that's going
to hold
who knows I think that's just a
politically popular thing but I like the
fact that it's not um
that they're not making it automatic now
I understand there are a few countries
that made all the trans stuff illegal is
it Norway and Sweden
you just you can't do any uh trans
surgery on minors no no kind of medical
procedures until they're adults
so there's definitely a lot of pushback
on the he him gender fluidity stuff
happening like crazy
um
and related to that story
and you already knew this but it's worth
mentioning again
um you also have
how nice Trump was to Tim Scott entering
the race
did you notice how uncharacteristic it
was he is signaling so hard
I I mean Trump is is sending the
clearest possible signal that Tim Scott
is at least
on the short list
it was like he's testing it out he's at
least not the short list
and in my opinion he would be a
brilliant choice
I think he wins on every dimension
don't you
because he would be an unusually strong
vice president but not as charismatic As
Trump so that's a good fit
uh he's a senator so Vice President
should bring some government experience
you know you don't want to unknown for
vice president
so he perfect experience
um it could be maybe preparing him to
run for the presidency someday if he was
if he were Vice President
another positive
um but more importantly
um Tim Scott is a big you know
self-responsibility guy
so it's exactly the message that
counters the white supremacy systemic
racism stuff
so he's the perfect message the perfect
messenger he has prepared his whole life
by doing all the right stuff
and I like it when people who do all the
right stuff get rewarded
w
if somebody does everything right
and then things work out for them that's
just what you want to see and Tim Scott
is one of those he's basically one of
those people who said there's no
discrimination if you just do everything
right
and it's not that hard because everybody
will tell you what's right it's obvious
what's right you know stay at a stay out
of jail and pretty basic stuff
yeah he's a bachelor which I see a
number of you mentioning which of course
will raise questions
but it's not going to be a problem on
the left
right so the people on the left may or
may not say oh that's suspicious that
he's a bachelor and you know I kind of
questions they'd ask but on the left
that would just be another positive
so it kind of works in every possible
way people on the right are more like
why do we care
am I right
I think the conservative view is so
how does that affect me it doesn't
therefore he's fine
there's nothing else to say once you've
answered the question how does it affect
me
if the answer is it doesn't we're done
with that moving on we're done with that
moving on
so he's perfect
yeah he's perfect
and Trump obviously sees it because he's
going going so gently and I mean not
even gently he's just complimenting he
said quote good luck to Senator Tim
Scott and entering the Republican
primary
he said it is rapidly loading up with
lots of people and Tim is a big step up
from wrong to sanctimonious who is
totally unelectable
and they said he worked together with
Tim Scott and got some stuff passed and
yeah
now here's the interesting part
do you think the Democrats want to run
against the uh
uh DeSantis or did the Democrats want to
run against Trump
they want to run against Trump right
don't they
so you should see both the left and and
all the Trump people going after
DeSantis
DeSantis has a real problem because all
of the left and at the moment all of the
Trump people are against them that's a
lot of people
all of the Trump people and all of the
left
oh man that's a lot
now Trump beat those odds once see if he
could do it again
uh but it is looking pretty tough for uh
DeSantis
yeah
so uh you may have seen the news that uh
Carey Lake had a claim that the
signature comparisons were not done at
all or at least not done in any capable
way because the claim was that 274 000
signatures were compared in less than
two seconds
and seventy thousand were compared in
less than a second
so therefore
it would be impossible that it they
really did
signature checks but
I am going to demonstrate to you that
you can
do 274 000 signature comparisons in two
seconds are you ready
do you think I could do it
I'm gonna I'm gonna do it right in front
of you
I'm going to do a
