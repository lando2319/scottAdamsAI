come on in we're almost ready for the
show you
deserve well I think you deserve it do
you yeah yeah I think you do you've been
good all right let's check the stocks
uh well not so good all right forget
about that there'll be better
later but I got to call up my comments
here make sure
everybody's on
board there we
go boy there's a lot of news today so
much news oh my
goodness good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams you've never had a better
time but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a
cuper m glass of tanker Shel din the
Cante juger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens right
now yes exactly go
fully recharged I'm at working at full
strength
today we got news we're going to pound
right through it you ready for this
happy Friday by the
way let's see is there any new science
that they could have completely skipped
just by asking Scott oh yeah here's one
the University of South Australia found
out that
um being happy in your career doesn't
make you happy in life but being happy
in general in your life can make you
enjoy your career that you have
more um they could have just ask me yes
it's called Baseline happiness and if
you're happy in general everything else
in your life looks
better how how many of you didn't know
that was there anybody who thought you
know if I were depressed but I got a
better job I'll bet that would cheer me
up no doesn't work that way if you're
happy then even your crap job seems
pretty good to you and if you're
unhappy it doesn't matter how good your
job is you're still going to be unhappy
so just ask me next time I could have
cleared that up saved you a lot of
money well according to Marine Insight
publication uh over in Germany there's
this revolutionary new Wastewater
processing plant it's a Wastewater
processing plant and what's
revolutionary is that they can convert
the Wastewater into methanol which I
guess is kind of climate neutral and you
can use that for marine
fuels now I wonder if there's anybody
who works on the Wastewater
project that would tell us that we live
in a simulation let's see um the waste
water is being explained by Dr wizzing
WSS iing whizzing so Dr
whizzing can tell you about the waste
water um apparently Dr pooping was not
available he he's the number
two yep Dr whizzing for
Wastewater okay okay all right all right
judge me you can judge me on that
one um this you knew was coming nextg
defense is reporting that Max our
intelligence they've developed a a
vision-based software that can make GPS
unnecessary for your drone so in other
words if your drone gets jammed and it
can't see the GPS signal it doesn't care
because maxar intelligence has this
these databases that are really detailed
uh they've got 3D terrain data for 34
million square miles so it can just
switch to or maybe it doesn't even need
GPS which means that there's practically
no defense against drones
now if your drone can't be jammed if you
can't Jam the
GPS uh that seems like a problem so you
yes uh as nval ravan said recently it's
really inevitable that all Warfare will
be drones because why would you need
anything
else it's all going to be
drones well if you haven't yet seen Ezra
Klein on John Stewart's
podcast oh you have to see this I so
recommend this so look for the clips if
you just see the clips you'll you'll see
everything you need to see but uh so
Ezra Klein is a co-author of the book
abundance and he's doing you know I have
to say my my first
impression was hey you're just writing a
book that says democrats should act more
like Republicans if they want to win
anything so I wasn't sure it was adding
much to the
world but now I think it is so I'm going
to I'm going to switch to full
compliment to Ezra Klein and I guess
Derek Thompson the two co-authors so the
the thing that was amazing is that um uh
you know you've heard Ezra Klein talk
about how the Democrats uh are good at
funding impressive things but then for
reasons that I didn't quite understand
nothing got done so there was the
funding of the highspeed rail in
California that didn't get done there
was the funding of the um the rural
Broadband inter that didn't get done
there was the funding of the Nationwide
charging stations that didn't get done
all good ideas in theory but all they
could do is give them money and not get
anything
done and if you wonder why it is then
nothing gets done you just have to you
just have to here as reclin go through
the 14 steps it would have taken to
approve the just the
the project for the car charging
stations oh my God I'm not going to run
through the 14 because it's pretty
pedantic but you have to watch John
Stewart for the first time understanding
how completely doomed the Democrat way
of work is because the regulations are
mostly I'm thinking mostly Democrat
created and if you looked at any one of
them individually you'd probably say to
yourself all right well I could see why
you'd want this group to review
it or I could see why you'd want to run
it through this group for
approval but once you get to 14
different steps and everybody's got to
review it and analyze it and they got
time for comment it becomes literally
impossible so it's not just that it
didn't happen it's that the system was
impossible so anybody who tried to apply
to you know be one of the people who
executed on these funded um projects
couldn't get through it it would take
you the rest of your life if you got
through it at all so there is no
way to actually
execute on these uh well-meaning
Democrat gigantic
projects there is no way now what is it
I always say about the difference
between Republicans and
Democrats Democrats are really good at
goals highspeed rail that's a goal I
like it uh rural internet Broadband I
like it uh a
nationwide uh charging stations for
electric cars sounds pretty good those
are good goals I like it but they also
developed a system that made it
impossible now let's compare that to the
Republicans Republicans would say get
rid of all these uh this red
tape and then it
works that's it so the Republicans have
a
system which is in general get rid of
the red tape now beyond that if you got
rid of enough red tape maybe you don't
even need much government funding maybe
maybe the private sector can do it but
the Republicans
consistently have
systems that would work and the
Democrats consistently have pretty good
goals we'd like everybody to do well
we'd like the schools to do well take
take uh public
education the Democrats have a very good
goal that uh no matter what your income
is or what your situation is in life you
should get a good education and the
government government can help you on
that but then they overlay it with you
know the the the the Department of
Education which was a problem they
overlay it with the teachers union and
you very quickly get to the point where
the system for providing that thing
which is a good it just doesn't work and
that's what we observe scores are going
down in every way the uh whereas the
Republicans would say well nothing works
unless there's competition so let's make
sure there's a lot more competition for
private schools or alternative schools
so again in every domain it's the same
Democrats good on goals don't have a
systems let's check check in on
Dei
um Charlie Kirk has a post where he's
talking about daily wire Story by uh
Luke rosak I guess he did a great job on
this and the story is about uh a group
called The National diversity Council
now remember I tell you that it it turns
out that you can tell all the fraudulent
organizations because they string
together words that sound good so
instead of the national diversity
Council it could have been the American
Ferness
initiative you can just put any words
together the Freedom diversity
Association and then you start getting
money well one of the founders uh Dennis
Kennedy allegedly paid himself
$450,000 a year for 10 hours of work a
week but then in 2022 allegedly at the
peak of Dei
Mania uh he and a few other Executives
decided that they really owed another $3
million in back pay uh and so they
looted the organization is the
accusation and now the now the
organization is filing for
bankruptcy with the board saying that
Kennedy systematically looted it by
funling its assets to an to a for-profit
firm controlled by himself does that
sound
familiar that's exactly what we were
finding out with all the
NGS if the NGO gets a lot of funding
let's say from the government could be
private donations
uh then the first thing they'll do is
say here's how we're spending that money
we're going to hire this for-profit
entity that just happens to be my wife
or just happens to be me with another
name and we're not going to have any
accounting so that it's not as obvious
what we're doing it's the same
scam everywhere and once you realize the
pattern you can just pick it up
instantly it's like oh you got a bunch
of money you gave yourself a generic
name like the national diversity Council
and uh you can protect yourself by
accusing any of your critics of being
racists ah see that's
important because if you don't have an
audit process and you're planning to
loot the organization you want to make
sure that if anybody blames you of
anything you could say oh my God what
are you some kind of white supremacist
who hates who hates diversity
don't you see that diversity is in the
name of our
organization of course it's good because
it says diversity right in it it's right
in the name you
racist I think we're on to it now I
think we can spot these a little
easier well Mario nul is reporting that
uh Trump has threatened to defund the
Smithsonian over what he calls divisive
narratives and he's ordered JD Vance to
go clean house whatever that means and
what he wants to do is remove what he
calls improper ideology or El to lose
Federal funding and he accuses the
Museum of pushing a decades long effort
to rewrite US history with distorted
ideological narratives instead of
facts so they're going to have to get
rid of all the divisive content or else
the government won't fund them
anymore
and to me um I I can see why they're
doing it I'm sure it's a good idea but
history has always been fake so when you
take one version of fake history and
somebody's trying to rewrite it to
another version of fake
history it doesn't make it more accurate
but there is a version of History that's
better for the
country and if you're deciding to change
the history to white people suck now I
haven't seen what the smithsonia is up
to but I'm just going to take a WI wild
guess that what they're saying is that
white people are the problem they killed
all the Native Americans they created
all the slavery they stole all the money
and white people are bad just a guess I
I don't have any information that that's
what this Smithsonian was doing but what
do you
think what else would it be so yeah it's
very very damaging to have a fake
history that says the people who live
here today are part of the problem you
don't want that so it is better even if
it's fake history to say that your
country was awesome and you're still
awesome it's
better well here's a story that really
sounds great for America just listen to
this according to interesting
engineering uh an enormous um massive
lithium deposits have been discovered in
the
us uh worth $540 billion so much that it
would vastly reduce China's grip on the
United States for lithium so I I'm
reading this I'm like wow $540 billion
worth of lithium and it seems to be
accessible isn't that the greatest story
the only thing that could be bad about
this is if it's in
California don't be in California please
don't be in California please please
don't be in Cali
California it's in
California uh beneath the surface of the
sultan
sea so I guess the value is not 540
billion it would be closer
to uh let me call up Ezra Klein uh Ezra
uh there's $540 billion worth of lithium
in California under the sultan sea do
you think we can okay calm down Ezra
calm down
okay yeah I I know we'll never get it
yeah I know 14
steps okay we'll just leave it there
never mind thank you
goodbye yeah that's a complete waste of
time because it's in California I'd love
to be wrong I would love to be wrong but
no it's worth nothing because it's in
California that's all you need to
know uh Trump has floated the idea of
May be easing off on tariffs according
to Reuters um on China if China approves
the sale of tick tock to an American
entity what do you think of that idea
going easy on tariffs on China if they
approve a ticktock deal here's the
problem that would be transferring
wealth from um from the citizens of the
United States
to the rich people in the United States
who bought Tik Tock so the benefactors
would be the billionaires who buy
tiktock and that would be paid for
partly by money that would have
otherwise gone into the
treasury so how is Trump going to did he
think this
through now I'm not saying it's a bad
idea by the way what I'm saying is how
do you sell it because it's it's total
oligarch
friendly citizen unfriendly American
last I mean to me it looks like it'd be
kind of good for
China uh and good for a few oligarchs
who buy it who were his
buddies and I don't see how you sell
this thing now I will give you one
possibility one of the things that Trump
said was that the US
government if it's being helpful and
making the deal happen should get a
percentage of tick tock oh now that was
not part of this story but remember
Trump has floated that idea and he was
serious about it and it makes sense if
the government is doing something
important to make a private investment
worth something from zero to maybe be
worth a trillion dollars someday why
don't we get a piece of it if you give
me a piece of it meaning the citizens
I'm all in yeah if you say we're going
to reduce tariffs a little bit on China
um to get this deal done but in the end
the United States let's say our
Sovereign fund you know we I think we're
going to have trouble funding The
Sovereign fund there's some some
technical reason why the Sovereign fund
might be in Jeopardy um but this seems
like a perfect use for for a sovereign
fund where we invest literally
zero and we get a percentage of take
out I I'd be happy with more of that so
if if Trump combines two things he's
floated one is the reduction of tariffs
get the deal done and the other is us
gets a piece of the deal you can sell
that that that would be
sellable all well um the the house is is
uh according to just the news the house
passed a legislation to keep foreign
influence and of higher education called
the deterrent
act and uh let's see what it does it
mandates that schools have to report
foreign
gifts uh I think this is mostly
universities and colleges have to report
foreign gifts or at least $50,000 or
more and they have to report it to
the checking notes they have to report
that to the
Department of
Education
huh do do you see anything see any
problem with the
legislation because the Department of
Education is being
closed don't they need to update
[Laughter]
that I swear I don't even know what I'm
reading at this point is this true
did did they just
yesterday the Republicans this would
only be through the house not the Senate
but did they really just passed some
legislation in the house that says
somebody has to report to the Department
of no longer
existing there must be something wrong
with the
story but maybe
not well RFK Jr who I thought was being
a little bit
quiet you know until he got his SE legs
and figured out what was what but boy
he's not quiet now um I saw Wall Street
Apes had a video I couldn't tell how old
it was but he was talking how uh Black
Rock owns all of the Meat Packers in the
United States there are only four uh big
companies but Black Rock owns them
all and they um according to RFK they
also own a lot of the big Pharma
now I don't know if own is the
right description they might own a
percentage but does Black Rock own a
controlling interest in
Pharma because that would be something
I'd never heard before I definitely knew
that they were heavily invested in
everything that matters you know pretty
much every industry that matters but a
controlling interest I don't know and do
they have a controlling interest or
already own the Meat Packers so I have
some questions about that but that's
something RFK jun's bringing up seems
important to
me um then he also reported that uh some
of the career civil servant bureaucrats
were keeping RFK Jr from accessing
databases uh that would have information
about risks and dangers of certain drugs
and medical
interventions can you imagine that
and RV JR says that that these
bureaucrats are seemingly only serving
the industries they were supposed to
regulate so everything that RFK Jr has
been telling us before he got the job
you know to be in charge of all this
stuff it looks like it's all true it
looks like these are
completely broken industries that are
just serving the uh the Pharma the far
industries that it just seems broken
entirely um but uh RFK junor was on
Chris Cuomo show in news nation and he
said the CDC so that would be under him
is launching a new sub agency to
specialize in vaccine
injuries um so that should make you
happy now he's very careful about the
fact that you know it's not going to be
based on the hearsay or anecdote they're
going to look into it with the you know
the best gold standard science that they
can which has not been applied to this
question yet so if the only thing he
does is apply the best science to it
even if it finds out that the vaccines
weren't as bad as you
thought you're going to be a lot happier
now I think most of you are expecting to
find out that the vaccinations various
ones not just not just Co uh but I think
you expect at least this audience does
that it's going to find out that they
were much more dangerous than you
thought so but either way we need to
know we need to know I'm open to the
fact that it might go either way um but
we definitely need to know it's it's
right at the top of things we should be
caring about and then uh RFK Jr was talk
about Elon Musk using AI to improve
health and efficiency and improve
delivery so he said they've had a bunch
of geniuses come over to RFK Jr's domain
to try to figure out how to do that can
you
imagine how much money could be driven
out of health care if you only knew what
worked and what
doesn't separately I saw another story I
didn't I didn't write this one down um
about how there's a a large number of
complications with medication
that are very specific to your genetic
makeup so if you could of course there's
a problem you know anytime your your
genetic makeup is part of a database you
have to worry about that but imagine if
we just had those two databases what's
your genetic makeup and how does this
drug do for people with your genetic
makeup and you could get rid of
something like 9% of all the
injury that's huge that's huge
so but think of all the different
ways that AI could just make everything
work better do you think you've ever
taken a
medication that didn't work well with
the other medications you were taking
and you just didn't know it probably
probably and AI could help you with that
so at the very least you should take a
picture of all your pill bottles with AI
and the next time you get a next time
you get a Pres prescription and say I
get a new prescription is it going to
work well with all the ones I already
have and by the way if you use chat GPT
at the the highest level expensive one
you can literally do that you could just
put all your pill bottles in a row and
just put it on video and just take a
picture of all your pill bottles and say
I'm going to add this pill uh my doctor
said to add this one and it will tell
you it'll tell you which ones don't work
with other ones more so I think even
then your doctor would I mean they're
supposed to flag it but you can't expect
them to know every
interaction I've never seen a doctor
look
up uh an interaction while I was talking
to him I wonder wonder if this system
does that for him you know and my health
care system is pretty well
automated um so it might be that they if
they just prescribe it maybe it puts up
a warning I don't know I'm I'm kind of
skeptical that it's already built into
the system but it could be could be big
meanwhile demo Tim
wals uh he was at a some kind of event
and he was urging Democrats to uh to get
more serious about Dei and immigration
he thinks that uh the problem was they
didn't go hard enough on those things so
he goes quote we'd let them Define the
issue on immigration we'd let them
Define the issue on Dei and we let them
Define what woke is we got ourselves in
this mess because we weren't bold enough
to stand up and say you're damn right
we're proud of these policies we're
going to put them in and see and and
we're going to execute
them I think the only thing he executed
were whatever was remaining of the
democrat's chance of
ever ever having a president
again let's be serious is this the
dumbest guy you've ever seen in
your life Tim wals is just not smart
he's just not smart so wow uh every time
I see one of their you know leaders say
something I just shake my head you know
and keep in mind you I just want to give
you some reference when I used to watch
Bill Clinton talk I used to think wow
he's really smart even if I didn't agree
with him when I saw Obama talk I would
say well at least you're very smart even
if I didn't agree with them but when I
see wallst or Jasmine Crockett I just
think God you're
dumb and I disagree with
you that's a that's a tough combo to be
dumb and wrong at the same
time all right many of you may have seen
Clips or watched uh uh Brett Bear on Fox
News interiew uh Doge and Elon Musk and
I got to say I was so impressed now
here's something that I say all the time
and it's because I'm a nerd but Fox News
has the best
producers if you look at that again just
look how good the lighting is the set
the
makeup the hair the
clothes the the physical setup and the
whole thing they they're just so good at
producing what they do they're they're
the best in the industry by
far so anyway the F so uh I've never
seen I've never seen musk look so good
you know maybe sometimes he's more tired
or you know the lighting's bad or
whatever but he looked great like he
looked healthy and like completely in
charge so that was great um but the
other thing that I noticed is that
musk is a talent stack guy meaning that
whatever talents he has which are
considerable of course uh he is
continually adding to them and I believe
that his close association with Trump is
teaching him things about Communications
and things about
persuasion that is taking him to the
next level because very few people can
Master those domains as as well as let's
say a technical domain um but if you
look at if you look at uh musk today his
ability to come up with a sentence
you'll remember forever is it's almost
trump-like I mean nobody can match Trump
he's he's category by himself but you
can see you can see the transfer of
skill you can tell that he's impressed
this is just me reading mins but you
could tell that if he's normal he's he's
impressed by Trump's ability to
communicate and to control a crowd and
to control a narrative and boy as he
learned well so I watched a number of
mostly I saw the clips I didn't see 100%
of it but I was impressed completely
about how how
succinctly musk can explain an idea and
you'll remember her forever I'll give
you an example um he said that they're
already finding or they're goal is to
find four billions per day in savings
and they're on track to be mostly done
in 130 days which is what he's
authorized
for how how clean and simple is that and
Brett Bear says well uh you know are you
going to be doing reports and mus says
um we're doing the actual
savings so they're I mean they're
reporting the savings but you don't need
to report
because every time they add another you
know billion dollars or whatever the
savings they put it on the website
so you don't need a report because it's
reported as it happens so that's a
perfect
answer the 4 billion per day I'll
remember that if he had said something
like you can imagine somebody who was
bad at it saying well we're finding
anything from1 to8 billion doll per day
and you know we're we're we're hoping
that that's
enough no he tells you $4 billion per
day for roughly 130 days is going to get
to you we think a trillion dollars in
savings which is 50% of the the deficit
spending the other trillion Trump is
going to handle with growth he we
hope so that's perfect just
communication wise absolutely perfect
you could you could not improve on that
it's so clean 4 billion a day 130 days
to1
trillion I I'll never forget
that um and then then they add the
anecdotes imagine all the complicated
things that doge is looking into and
imagine if they tried to explain the
complicated things you'd be
like that sounds pretty complicated but
you you go
wild instead he gives the cleanest
little anecdotal example to back up you
know the numbers and he says that at one
point nearly a billion dollars um was
allocated I think per year for some
company that would do a survey that
apparently nobody needed or
wanted there was no there didn't even
seem to be any
obvious uh customer for it a billion
dollars year for one little
survey that looked like it was done by a
high school group a complete ripoff as
far as we can tell now will you remember
that 1 billion real easy to remember for
one survey that looks like it was done
by high school kids you'll remember that
forever right that one's just perfect
for
communication so even and even having
the uh I guess it was the other Doge
leaders sitting behind him um that was
great then the other thing he said and
this is just perfect Genius of
communication you know how the biggest
problem with doge is hey you're using a
chainsaw instead of a scalpel stop using
the chainsaw when all of us smart people
who are Democrats know you should be
using a scalpel where's the
scalpel so the way he handled that was
he said that uh they're they're
measuring everything twice if not
Thrice before they cut so this old the
old saying is you know measure twice cut
once so he's moving away from the you
know the scalpel chainsaw thing but he's
he's letting you know that they're not
making any Cuts unless they've measured
twice if not Thrice
do you notice that twice and Thrice
rhyme who's that remind you
of Johnny
Cochran if the glove doesn't fit you
must equit if the glove doesn't fit you
must equit we'll measure it twice if not
Thrice it is a a well-known persuasion
fact that if something Rhymes it's more
persuasive when California tried to get
people to wear uh seat belts and they
told them they were going to get a a
ticket unless they did the the uh
campaign was click it or tick it
basically click your your seat belt
where you get a ticket it click it or
tick it if the glove doesn't fit you
must equit we're measuring it twice if
not
Thrice
perfect perfect now if he had said and I
would have made made this mistake I
think if he would have said you know but
sometimes you need a
chainsaw that might be true it might be
it might be smart but it would not be
the right answer for communicating to
the public what the public wants to hear
and the only thing they want to hear is
I'm going to measure it
twice if not Thrice
so what I saw was a
absolute lesson on how to be
perfect that was from from the producers
of the show to Brett Bear's questions
which were excellent he's always
excellent in that domain to musk
specific answers to the people who were
the head of Doge sitting behind him and
backing him up with answers every part
of that was the highest quality you'll
ever see for something like this it was
really really
impressive
anyway moving on uh according to the
Wall Street Journal uh billions of
taxpayer dollars have been wasted on
duplicate Medicaid payments and mus has
already said that Doge will fix that now
how did that happen the daily wire is
talking about it but I think Wall Street
Journal did the original uh
investigation and what they found was
there are a number of cases where people
should have been reimbursed by their
insurance
company um and or I guess Medicaid was
going to pay the insurance company but
then they
moved and so the systems were not clever
enough to pick up the fact that it was
the same person but at a different
address so apparently these big
insurance companies the biggest ones in
the country health insurance were
receiving two
payments for a whole bunch of people if
they had moved during some certain time
and the the dollar amounts were
massive um totaling up to at least $4.3
billion $4.3
billion that went to insurance companies
from the government it didn't go to the
individuals so it wasn't like that none
of the people involved were involved in
fraud so they didn't break any laws they
just moved and so United Health remember
United
Health I'm not going to say
it I'm not going to say it I'm just
going to say United Health was one of
them uh elevant Els or elant health and
senteni I don't know any of those they
received hundreds of millions of dollars
each in duplicate payments you know what
this story doesn't
include it doesn't include that those
insurance companies are going to pay
back the taxpayers
who are owed that money are
they it's such massive amounts that it
probably would eliminate their profit
for a year or two I don't know what
their profits are but don't they have to
pay that back because nobody's arguing
that they were owed the
payment it it seems like it's easy to
demonstrate that these were duplicate
payments
so where's our
check uh if feels to me we should be
clawing that all back um if it's
possible well here's an update on uh
Katherine Katherine marah the CEO of
NBR um I picked up on this yesterday but
Brit Brit Hume had a take on it on X he
says uh when you read or hear about NPR
Chief Katherine Maher being grilled
about her hard left views as expressed
on Twitter in 2020 remember that's five
years ago remember it was three years
after those tweets that she was made
head of NPR so did NPR know what her
views were because she claims now that
they're different that her views have
evolved in five years but do you know
what Katherine Mah calls five
years she calls it half a
decade I was listening to her being uh
grilled by the Congress and when she
said but you you know that was half a
decade ago half a decade that's 5 years
how many people have a complete
transformation of political opinion in
five years and it's not on one topic
like I I could see how somebody would
say oh I used to believe in this hoax
but I found out blah blah blah but how
do you have a a total revamp of your
political opinions from crazy far left
to something more moderate in half a
decade half a decade you
lying whatever um here's something I
didn't know I had to look it up 1 to 3%
of their funding comes from the
government so I don't really care about
this too much one to three% of their
funding it it seems like we should just
yank the funding because 1 to 3% is
something that can certainly handle and
why am I paying for any of this
then Christopher rufo on X reminds us he
says don't forget the nprc CEO Katherine
Mah is also the board chairman of
signal she's the board chairman of
signal come on are we living in a
simulation how's that even possible the
only thing that could be weirder is if
she were like the daughter of Judge
bosberg she's not by the way but it's
the only thing that would make this
weird
and then uh rufo goes on and says and
she spent a decade working on regime
change operations in the Middle East and
North
Africa now I don't think anybody has had
a more uh a more obvious connection to
the CIA than she
has now it's not I can't confirm that I
don't have proof of that but uh all of
this from being CEO of NPR to being on
the chairman of the board of signal to
being working on regime change
operations in the Middle East and North
Africa what does that sound like to
you does that sound like just a bunch of
coincidences sometimes things are just
what you think well the uh one of the
biggest Tesla domestic terrorists has
been caught uh in Las Vegas I guess
police made an arrest it was the the guy
who did the most uh elaborate domestic
violence he's the one who set on fire
multiple cars at a uh I guess it was a
um it was a Tesla facility for repair I
think collision repair and used a gun he
fired some shots and used some Molotov
cocktails and of course he has a history
of being he's 36 years old has a history
of being associated with the Communist
party and anything everything else is
bad anyway he was booked on 15 counts he
could get up to 20 years in prison uh
also a woman seen keying at Tesla in
Washington has been identified she's in
trouble also that 450 lb guy who was on
some kind of a scooter thing and ramming
the side of a car he's been easily
identified and that's not a complete
list how many of the domestic terrorists
have now been completely identified
because I feel like we'll get just about
all of them you know the ones that
showed their faces so um it looks like
the world is starting to get Back in
Balance meaning that um as long as
there's a continual drip of the domestic
terrorists getting serious jail
sentences um maybe it'll decrease you
know maybe the Democrats will get tired
of it I don't know maybe they'll run out
of crazy
people I saw a post by Insurrection
Barbie who was a great follow by the way
if you're not following on X
Insurrection Barbie you're missing a lot
of great
content um but Insurrection Barbie says
the entire resistance to Donald Trump is
made up of like 300 super connected
Democrats and a bunch of paid protesters
easy to realize why they lost election
and why they're continuously bleeding
voters um but this is your daily
reminder that 300 powerful Democrats and
their NGO are trying to hold the country
hostage and I think Keon musk agreed
with that estimate that there are about
300 highly connected
Democrats who are pretending to be de
the Democrats basically they're the ones
in charge that that number completely
agrees with my understanding of the
world about 300 and of course within the
300 there would be you know 50 who are
super important and maybe you know 10
who are head of the pyramid but we do
see the same names don't we it feels
like you know if there's something
terrible happening you know lawfare or
something else it feels like the same
set of people just keep popping up over
and over again so yeah it's about 300
they just act like they're
more so Trump wants an investigation of
how it is possible according to the
Washington Times uh that uh he keeps
getting bad judges by chance so
apparently these DC judges should be
assigned randomly they've got some kind
of wheel they spend uh but yet this
judge bosberg who is uh let's say the
Trump supporters think he's been highly
biased and uh has conflicts they would
say um he was nominated by Barack Obama
Etc and that somehow amazingly he got
this newest case about the signal appp
and whether that has to do with uh
possibility of any federal records being
destroyed because the app automatically
deletes things so what are the odds that
he would be
chosen yet again for another Trump
related case Well turns out um as the
Washington Times reports and this is
good reporting by the way I didn't know
that there are
20 so if you were going to say how does
this one guy get four of these Trump
cases when it's one and a 20 every time
well it would help if you knew that
there um there's another judge G Cobb
who has at least 10 Trump related cases
but I've never heard that name have you
judge
Cobb how could one judge have 10 Trump
Rel
cases and I've never heard the
name my guess is that there are 10 cases
that aren't that
important and there are three other
judges that have six
each uh two of them have five each and
several judges have four well the first
thing you need to know is that there are
so many of these lawfare situations
against Trump that if you only have 20
judges they're all going to get half a
dozen
because even if you did it randomly
they're just so many judges that they're
they're just all going to come up half a
dozen
times that's exactly what's happening um
but I don't believe it's random here's
what I think I think it depends who
filed the lawsuit I think if one of the
300 which is really one of a half dozen
I think there are some
lawyers that if they're involved they
seem to get the right
judge I don't think that it's a
coincidence that judge Cobb has 10 cases
and I've never heard that name they
can't be the important
ones so I've got a feeling it's not
random even though a lot of people have
a lot of
cases um so Trump according also
according to the Washington Times Jeff
moro's writing about this uh Trump is
stripping security clearance from yet
another Law
Firm um what is it Wilmer haale it's a
high-powered Washington law firm and
they had once employed special counselor
Robert
Mueller and this is what the the
executive order Banning them from uh
working on government stuff says it says
that the law firm has abandon the
profession's highest
ideals and abused its pro bono practice
to engage in activities that undermine
the justice and interest of the United
States and I gives some
examples um it supported efforts to
discriminate based on race uh I assume
that means Dei stuff backs the
obstruction of efforts to prevent
illegal aliens from committing horrific
crimes and trafficking deadly drugs
within our border and furthers a
degradation of the quality of American
elections including supporting efforts
designed to enable noncitizens to vote
here's my
problem that's sort of the job of
lawyers lawyers don't just represent
innocent people who are
angels our system completely depends on
qualified lawyers also taking cases that
you and I hate and say why you doing
that why you doing that pro bono thing
for these terrible people so to me this
looks like lawfare
and remember I said from the beginning
I've told you if if it looks like
lawfare to me I'm going to call it out
it's a little hard to be a team player
and be in favor of lawfare however I'm
going to soften it a little
bit because there's so much lawfare
against the president that is completely
out of out of the
norm that this looks like a brush back
pitch to me as in if I keep getting
lawed I'm going to take you all down and
even if I lose every one of these in
some upper Court I'm going to make sure
you're spending all your time wasting
your time trying to fight this because
you all suck and you're all political
and you can pretend that you're just
helping your clients but you're
obviously just a lawfare organ of the
Democrats and we have a completely
broken system where the lawyers are
trying to basically run the whole
 Country Now under those
conditions I'm okay with law fair
because the law fair is a brushback
pitch I'm not in favor of going to a
baseball game and watching the pitcher
throw unlimited pitches at the head of
the opposing batter no I don't want to
watch that but if that team does
something really messed up and the
Pitcher decides to put one right into
the body of the
batter you understand that don't you you
understand that they're they're trying
to get balance back now you might not
love it because it's violent I'm not
recommending it but we do see that in
the real world if you don't have
mutually assured
destruction everything falls
apart so if you look at it as just law
fair it's bad but if you look at it as a
response to
lawfare which is what it is it's a
response response to lawfare if they
laware them back just as hard um that is
establishing mutually assured
destruction and it may have more to do
with suppressing the next thing they do
than it does with you know addressing
anything in the past so I'm in favor of
it I I'm in favor of it and I think it's
lawfare and I think it's
appropriate um according to bre Bart
news Simon Kent is writing that uh Trump
Administration is going to suspend
contributions to the WTO the World Trade
Organization so I had to look up what
the heck does the World Trade
Organization do what it does is
allegedly uh at least up till now it has
opened markets to 160 different
countries and lowered tariffs and made
it easier to dispute trade problems
across borders and basically greased the
wheels to make it easier for every
country to do business with every other
country so you might ask why do we want
to suspend our contribution to that and
I think the answer is because if your
organization is trying to find a middle
ground where everybody's happy it's not
America
first um it could be well let's let's
make sure that you know China and the
United States are both you know kind of
Happy Happ but kind of unhappy but maybe
we could have done a better deal so I
don't know if this will work out or not
work out but the idea that we can handle
our own tariffs and our own disputes and
we've got enough um Market muscle to say
look if you don't handle this
dispute we're just not going to do
business with you or we're going to tear
off the beesa S of you so
tentatively this looks like a good idea
because they're not the the WTO is not
meant to be America first so maybe we
can do better on our own we'll
see that wouldn't be true for smaller
countries I suppose but for America
maybe well as you know this story you've
heard before that Jasmine Crockett
called the governor Abbott of Texas
governor Hot Wheels because abits in a
wheelchair and this of course caus the
Democrats to bring up the uh what they
probably think is true by the way um but
it's a hoax that Trump ever mocked a
reporter who had a disability with an
arm
now um I saw Brendan straa doing a great
job of debunking that I've seen you know
the debunk America doing a great job at
debunking it's the most thoroughly
debunked thing and it's easy to debunk
because
um you can show the video from before
the incident with the reporter where he
would do the same action when he was
talking about anybody who couldn't
answer a question or anybody who was
doing a bad job communicating basically
it was his way of mocking them
um so i' but you also know that Jasmine
Crockett tried to explain her comment as
not really being about the
wheelchair and that the Hot Wheels
comment was something about
transporting immigrants or
something so without further Ado I would
like to do my impression of Jasmine
Crockett trying to explain why she
called Governor Abbott Hot Wheels but it
really didn't have anything to do
with his uh his disability and this is
Jasmine
Crockett whoa whoa
who see how that
[Laughter]
works all
right um I saw Sabine Hassen Felder on X
she's a German physicist saying she said
I genuinely don't understand why some
people are still bullish about llms the
technology behind Ai and she talks about
how she's used a bunch of the AIS and
she's doing it for her work in s sence
and that it often gives her um sources
that don't exist or there's a 404 error
um it'll tell her that a document that
says 2025 on it is from
2023 so she has to continually fact
check the ai's work and it just looks
kind of limited to her and wonders why
people are so so enthusiastic about his
future now I've said similar things and
people's response to me and to other
people who have had this experience they
say you you just don't understand how
um you don't understand how what is
it
um oh what's the
word don't understand how exponential
improvements work so the smartest people
who like AI are saying Scott Scott
Scott you're so dumb uh let me explain
how the world Works can I um AI is not
supposed to be the best it will ever be
today it's going to get better like
really fast and there's going to be this
exponential growth that's going to
happen any minute now and when that
kicks in you're going to look like such
a fool oh man a fool because you don't
understand how exponential growth works
yeah it seems slow slow slow slow but
then when it kicks in
boom and that's why you're not seeing
because you're not you know you don't
understand technology like we
do to which I
say have you ever heard of Moore's law
about the microchips getting better
every year it's a straight
line no exponential period have you ever
heard of a thing called Fusion nuclear
fusion that was first um proposed and
worked on 93 years ago 93 years still
waiting for the exponential growth part
93 years what about airline travel I'm
waiting for the exponential growth in
that because since I was a child it's
been largely the same and the planes
don't even change they're like 40 years
old yeah so we got that
um so what else we got um what about
batteries I'm always talking about all
these breakthroughs and batteries now
that's a case where I think there will
be an exponential growth and the reason
is that there are people all over the
world who know know there's enormous
money to be made in making a better
battery enormous so you got all kinds of
people the best people working on it all
over the world and they're trying
different
Technologies so if you have the best
people all over the world and giant
money involved and working on different
Technologies the odds of one of them
being 10 times as good as the old one
are pretty good so if if you said to me
Scott don't you know that batteries you
know may be chugging along for a while
but once we get you know we get to a
certain point man those batteries are
going to be amazing I would believe that
one I believe that one it's just that
not everything can turn into everything
else what about
smartphones so our smartphones kind of
came kind of awesome because they're
smartphones but how different is your
current smartphone from the last
one I feel like smartphones sort of peak
I I'm waiting for that exponential
growth but I don't think it's coming
with smartphones probably some other
technology so here's what I think um I
used AI five times already this morning
mostly grock it was great because that's
how I know that Fusion has been worked
on for 93
years I just asked grock and uh that's
how I knew what the w UT does I ask Rock
So if you're a writer or you're working
in this kind of world this podcasting
world and you're trying to get context
and you're trying to get you know an
understanding of a new topic quickly oh
it is great it is great so in some
professions and Bill Gates was saying
that uh medical profession legal
profession some other ones we're going
to see
AI takeover and I believe that
so I'm very Pro AI it's just that I
don't think the current technology the
large language models are ever going to
help
Sabine do her science stuff because you
can't rely on it being right it might be
that you always have to fact check the
facts if you're doing science stuff the
the stuff I do I could get a fact wrong
and it wouldn't nobody would die you
know tomorrow's somebody would say um on
the show yesterday you said Fusion's
been around 93 years but really it's 50
I'd say oh okay so it works great
whenever you're in a domain where if
something's wrong it's not the biggest
problem in the world but do you think an
llm will ever become the pilot of your
commercial aircraft I'm going to say no
do you think llm will be good enough to
be the robot that can do generic tasks
and you just have to show it or teach
it I'm
skeptical because you wouldn't want a
robot in your
house that was lossy meaning that you
couldn't you couldn't know exactly what
was going to
happen so I'm going to say that uh the
llms have amazing potential for a whole
bunch of different things but we're
going to need to invent a whole
different kind of thing for this you
know the artificial general intelligence
the one that thinks like we do and is
less
lossy that's what I think anyway the
Gateway uh Gateway Punda is reporting on
my idea of creating the department of
imaginary concerns to handle all the
fake Democrat problems Mike Lance wrote
about this and uh if you hadn't heard
about that the idea is that Democrats
have a whole bunch of imaginary problems
everything from climate crisis to um
Russia collusion the signal controversy
uh Elon mus stealing your social
security numbers like just a whole bunch
of fake stuff uh Trump's going to become
Hitler um he's Putin's best friend all
that stuff so you just put that in the
um the department of imaginary concerns
now the reason I brought it up is I want
to give you a very quick um persuasion
lesson a few people said hey don't call
it the department of imaginary
concerns call it the imaginary problems
or the imaginary policies or something
like that the word concerns is what made
this
viral so that's the actually the active
word so if you didn't understand
persuasion you would say hm concerns is
too generic or it's off it's off point
or something if you do understand it you
know that that's the word that sold it
when you see
concerns it tells you that somebody's
concerned as opposed to it's a problem
or or anything in the real world and
it's a non-standard word in this domain
you wouldn't expect to see the word
concerns in the name of a title of a
department so it's the
mistake or isn't the mistake that makes
it do that makes it viral so that's what
made it sticky meanwhile zinsky is uh
self ulating so he launched according to
the National pulse Christopher tomson he
uh he's attacking Trump's team um and he
said the following stuff he said
the he said that the
uh that Europe unlike the United States
has discipline and no chaos chaos who
says the United States has chaos
Democrats
right have you ever heard a republican
say oh we got a bunch of chaos nope it's
just a Democrat thing and now zilinsky
is taking that that approach and he says
Europe good us chaos and then he accused
uh uh
witkoff um he said uh I can't be
ungrateful to the Americans for
everything they did but they are often
unfortunately under the influence of
Russian narratives and then he said then
he went off on wickoff and he says he
doesn't look like a military man he
doesn't look like a general and he
doesn't have such experience as far as I
know he is very good at selling and
buying real estate and this is a little
different um well
zalinski good luck because America's
out you you just made it impossible to
get peace in Ukraine with America's help
a apparently he really wants a permanent
war and Europe's on his team and I say
good luck guys good luck um you can
fight Russia all day long but there's no
freaking way after you've insulted
wickoff and Trump that you're going to
get what you want from the United States
you just close that door you idiot or
maybe he knows exactly what he's doing
but there's no reason for us to be
involved anymore
he made it easy to walk
away um and then he said that he's
rejecting any idea for a peace deal that
would involve uh that would not involve
Russia giving back all the territory
that they've conquered including Crimea
now given that we know there's no way
that's ever going to
happen has he just slam the door shut on
any kind of a peace deal and America
being productive in any of it he has the
door shut so I don't care what the news
is tomorrow or the next day I don't care
if he changes his mind I don't care if
he apologizes it's over I'm going to
call it we're out now the United States
has not said that Trump has not said
that I don't think he's commented
exactly
but I feel pretty confident that this
just ended the productive relationship
with the United States of UK gra we're
definitely not going to be helping them
defend themselves um at this point now
something could change I suppose but I
think we're done but at the same time
and this is
fascinating um Jack bobc of human events
was talking to Scott bessent and Scott
bent says that they've got 100 page
Ukraine deal about the minerals not
about peace but about minerals that he
hopes will will be get signed next week
now it is
possible that we could make a mineral
deal it's not impossible because the
mineral deal would not be promising
anything about security it would just be
a way for them to make money and for us
to make
money so they might say yes to making
money because they need money to fight
their war and from our perspective it
might give them a little what uh besten
not a security guarantee but it is an
economic security PCT now I'm not so
sure the United States would want to get
involved in some place that didn't have
good defense against Russia coming in
and taking the rest of the country so I
don't know if we can actually get
private companies to do the work because
that would be a pretty big risk but if
it works that'd be great but I I think
in terms of the US funding Ukraine's
military Adventure I think that's over I
think we're done with that meanwhile the
Greenland trip is getting spicy you knew
that JD Vance and his wife were going
over there but here's the funny part
apparently
um the the Mike walz was always uh
intended to be part of the trip but they
had forgotten about him uh when they did
the the notice so National Security
advisor Mike walls will also be
attending the
trip all I can hope is they don't
accidentally invite Jeffrey Goldberg on
the
[Laughter]
trip that's a call back yeah okay can
you imagine them being on the plane and
they look over and it's like oh my God
and Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally
invited on the
[Laughter]
trip all right that's all I got for you
thanks for thanks for putting up with me
uh that's all I've got for today I'm
going to talk to the local subscribers
privately for a minute the rest of you
make sure you come back tomorrow same
time same place we'll have some more fun
so if you're on exra rumble or YouTube I
appreciate you joining and I'll see you
tomorrow locals I'll be coming at you
privately
