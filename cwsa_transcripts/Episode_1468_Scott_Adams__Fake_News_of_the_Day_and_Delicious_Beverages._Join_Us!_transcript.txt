favorite part of the day
I just can't wait to see all of you it's
actually true
I know I have my my lighting optimized
today but I'm kind of liking this low
light situation I've got here makes it
more intimate don't you think
well for those of you who are obsessed
with my audio quality on locals today I
took the electronics out going directly
into my iPad with a lavalier
meanwhile on YouTube I'm going through a
road caster
so you're getting different audio if you
like one of them well watch the one you
like
I don't know if there's any difference
really
but I'll know later
when I look at it
and if you'd like today to go up a level
get a little bit better I think you do
all you do is a copper bug of glass a
tanker challenge the canteen jungle
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dope media of
the day the thing that makes everything
better everything
accept my lighting it's called the
simultaneous sept and it goes like this
go
well funny thing happened yesterday
people on locals already heard this
story because they're special
but yesterday I was threatening to throw
my HP printer around the window because
I was having some trouble with it
well it turns out that if you do a
popular live stream
and you threaten to throw a product out
the window you will get a call from the
people who make that product
so I got a call from uh Hewlett Packard
they have an executive rapid response
team for exactly these social media
situations
and they asked me if there was anything
they could do could they possibly uh
help me get my product running or
if there's something they could do to
maybe discourage me from throwing it out
a window on live stream which I
understand would be bad for business bad
for business
so I'm not going to throw my HP printer
out the window and I will say uh let me
say for those who sort of uh were
missing the fun part of this uh HP is a
great company
and they make really good products Great
American company and I had already
ordered an upgraded HP printer so every
three years or so you have to get rid of
a printer they're mechanical
it's a mechanical device it's not going
to last forever
it was time to upgrade anyway so I've
got a new HP printer on the way but uh
HP was on it
I gotta say when you see a big
corporation uh
says we've been played no I actually did
plan to throw it out the window
if any of you are thinking that I was
bluffing about that not at all no I was
actually I was only looking for the
right time of day and you know I was
trying to figure out how to film it
right everything I was totally gonna do
it
just for fun
but I also didn't want to clean up all
the shards so that was part of it anyway
fake news of the day great news of the
day
we got a lot of it today
New York Post is reporting that there's
a information coming out that new study
says babies born during covid
the pandemic have lower IQs and not just
a little bit
like really really lower IQs
now true or fake news the explanation
given is that is not biological rather
it's uh has to do with the situation
and the thinking
is that maybe the parents were all
frazzled and stressed and staying home
too much and there wasn't enough
stimulation for the kid
do you believe any of that
does any of that sound true
do you believe that babies
who were raised in the situation where
everybody's home
around the baby
that they get less stimulation than if
everybody's going to work and you leave
the baby with the with the caretaker or
I don't know where
whoever takes care of the baby or if one
of you goes to work and one of you stays
home with the baby
that baby is smarter because there's
only one of you home are you telling me
that a baby with a house full of people
is going to get less stimulation and be
less smart than a baby that stays home
with one person all day
I don't know
I would say at the very least the
explanation with which they hypothesize
doesn't sound right to me I mean just on
this surface it doesn't set right and
then I think some of you are asking in
the comments how exactly do you measure
the IQ of a newborn
can you even do that
how old does the baby have to be before
you can get a good read on its IQ
yeah how do you measure that now I
imagine it's something like you know
does the baby you recognize a sound or
you know does it turn toward a thing or
it doesn't know that the the toy is
under the cup I don't know
something like that but I got real
questions about the accuracy of this
study if it's true it's the biggest news
in the world
right if this were true
it's the biggest news in the world
because this would indicate you can
totally manipulate the IQ of your baby
by what's happening the first year
if that's true
we can turn all of our babies into Super
Babies by figuring out what was
different about the pandemic and then
you do more of the stuff that's
different from that
you got super babies and all the people
in other countries who are competing
against well they'll just have normal
babies and their babies will never
compete with our super babies
but I'm going to say uh because it's not
the biggest story in the world that the
experts are maybe not buying this
because if they were
I mean correct me if I'm wrong
if if our baby is born during the
pandemic we're really
noticeably Dumber
we wouldn't be talking about anything
else
it would be by far that would be the
biggest problem so apparently other
people are not buying this story but
here it is all right here's some more uh
CNN fake news
and this is fake news by intentional
lack of context
so there are lots of ways to fake the
news here's one of them
So Adam dopamine found this and on
Twitter and uh this is CNN in a written
written piece uh they talked about
Alabama hospital who says we're seeing a
lot of children
that are very very sick admitted to our
Hospital
we have almost twice as many right now
as we did at the previous worst part of
the pandemic
pretty bad
and
so uh so how bad is that it's twice as
bad
What's missing
the number
what about the number
okay it's twice as bad
I don't know
do I care because if it was one person
last year and there's two people today
do I care that it's twice as bad I kind
of need a little context
well somebody else on Twitter found
another local source for I think the
same story but uh local Source said 33
children are hospitalized in Alabama
with covet
33. so let's say the number went from I
don't know they say almost twice
so let's say it's uh I don't know
15 extra children
so let's say 15 extra children
is that enough to change your National
policy
because of the 15 most of them won't die
right
so there might be 15 extra children
maybe five of them will die
anybody dying is a tragedy and you know
extra so for if it's a child so not to
minimize the fact that these are real
people not just statistics five people
being a tragedy of course one person
being a tragedy
but we do need to manage the country to
these risks and I don't believe that
they've been given to a straight by CNN
tell us the number next time
all right um
and then here's another one from CNN
quote some Hospitals now report their
intensive care units which are usually
reserved for the most critically ill
patients are full
some hospitals
how many is some hospitals
how many hospitals are there
are there let's say ten thousand
hospital I don't know does anybody know
how many hospitals there are in the
country a thousand
ten thousand what would be anybody just
tell me the number of hospitals do do a
fact check
but what are some hospitals have uh are
impacted
what what if there are 10 000 hospitals
and five of them or somebody has a
number here 1500 770.
there are about four thousand acute care
hospitals well your numbers are all over
the place people but let's say it's in
the low thousands
if you have hospitals in the low
thousands how many of them
are impacted some some three
what would be some three or four
how big is this problem
we're literally being managed and
manipulated because they don't want us
to know the number obviously it'd be
easy enough to find the number how hard
would it be for CNN to say there are you
know say 5 000 hospitals in the world
whatever it is in the country
and uh seven of them are impacted
and we think and you would also say your
prediction seven of them are impacted we
think there could be uh
uh bing says there's 6090 hospitals all
right so let's say you say there are six
thousand hospitals and seven of them are
impacted
that would tell me something and maybe
we think there'll be 100 impacted and if
they're in the big cities of course
that's a bigger deal
um so now we're seeing the stories about
the people who had medical problems
because their surgeries Etc were delayed
let me tell you my story just so you can
add an anecdote and it's dangerous to
add anecdotes to your knowledge that
when you're trying to make decisions
because they're too influential but I'll
give you one example
last year during the pandemic I was
scheduled to get sinus surgery
now a sinus surgery to remove some
polyps now sign the surgery is not the
biggest deal in the world
but
because it got delayed I had to be on
Prednisone for way longer than normal to
keep things managed until the surgery
and I would say that there's a good
chance that that ruined my life
now I won't give you the details but
let's just say that it caused a series
of events directly from the delayed
hospitalization that I think may have
ruined my life
you know through a series of related
events now not health-wise health-wise
I'm actually fine
but you can really up your life by
being six for sick for six months that
you didn't expect so for six months I
could barely walk up the stairs
after I got off the prednisone because
you get addicted to it so that was a
problem so I lost I lost six months of
my life
um you didn't notice so much because I
could I could fake it on camera pretty
well but I was in bad shape
for about six months and it had a you
know a consequence in my life
so these are pretty pretty big
um things going on with people delaying
hospitalization it's a big deal
and I can I can confirm that
um now of course CNN is trying to
persuade us by anecdote let's see how
they're doing
um
one of the things that CNN is doing is
they're sending Don lemonau he went to
uh I think he was raised in Alabama and
you went to Alabama hospitals
and and he's talking to somebody who's
like in the intensive care I might be on
oxygen I'm not sure
but uh Don Lemon asked this coveted
patient about not getting vaccinated and
says do you regret it
do you regret it so so see the scene in
your head Don Lemon in the hospital
talking to a guy who's you know in bad
shape from the covid and he says do you
regret getting the vaccination now if
you were to evaluate that as news
that's a failing grade
all right as news it's a failure because
it's showing you an anecdote
that will mislead you about things
without the statistics statistics would
be good that would be news and we
certainly know if the news says there
are lots of people in the hospital we
know what that looks like but if you
show one person
on camera
suffering with regret I didn't hear the
answer but I imagine there was some
regret there
um that's persuasion
that's pure persuasion now how much good
persuasion is there you've got visual
because it was actually video of a guy
in the hospital that's that's a plus
visual you've got fear because it's the
fear you put yourself in that person's
place and you say uh that doesn't look
good fear is visual
and then the last thing is you can put
yourself in it's personal you can put
yourself in the scene so even though
it's about somebody else you pretty
easily put yourself in the bed right
your brain just does that automatically
so how good is that for
um manipulation
a plus a plus if you were to give that a
grade for propaganda persuasion and
manipulation
a plus now
let me uh let me correct myself I I just
made a terrible mistake that I'd like to
correct I called it manipulation
is that fair
not by my own definition so this is what
I'm going to correct myself in it's
manipulation
if you're trying to make somebody do
something that's good for you and bad
for them
that's my definition if I try to get you
to give me money and it's not going to
be good for you but it's going to be
good for me well that's manipulation
if I can convince you to do that like
it's your own idea or something but what
if I try to convince you to do something
that's good for you let's say exercise
and E right
if I if I use persuasion to get you to
exercise and eat right
and you wanted to do those things am I
manipulating you or persuading now I
would call that persuasion because
that's a good intention and everybody's
on the same page manipulation is when
you're trying to change somebody's mind
and they don't want to change their mind
and they don't see what's good about it
best manipulation and that's what that's
what CNN was doing
CNN was changing your mind and you're
not sure that's good for you it might be
I'm not saying it's not I'm just saying
you're not so sure so that that gets
into the manipulation but my guess is
that CNN is not intending for a bad
result
I don't think they intend a bad result
I think they want people to have good
outcomes so I actually believe that
they're sincere in the sense that they
would like people to have better
outcomes so maybe that's not
manipulation the way they see it it
might just turn out to look like that
um how many non-obese people in the
United States died of covet today
anybody anybody can you give me a number
what would be the most useful data you
could have
you you should have a number of number
of people who died
number of people who were hospitalized
was you know intensive careless say
uh you need to know that but after you
knew that don't you need to know how
many were obese
and their age their age would be good
but I'll bet the Obesity is just as
just as important because your risk and
how you run your life will depend
entirely on how many people are getting
hurt
if it's a tiny tiny number are you going
to do one thing if it's a big number
you'll do another and if you're not
obese
and the only people who are getting
bad outcomes or mostly
are the obese well you'd make different
decisions Maybe
so here's a question I asked online I
said imagine a President Who persuaded
people to get fit to protect themselves
and protect the country at the same time
um
I don't know if we can handle that
right at various times we've had you
know presidential and you know physical
fitness initiatives and stuff but yeah
like JFK Etc but
they didn't really go very far did they
now we've had Obama who was a smoker
very sub-optimal we should never have a
president who's a smoker in my opinion I
think that's just such a bad look
uh then we had uh Trump who literally
doesn't exercise
it needs fast food we've got Biden who
um let me give him some Kudos Baidu is
very fit always has been I believe he's
a runner or has always been a runner so
Biden is actually at least a good role
model but he doesn't do anything about
persuading people to get fitter and I
think an excellent president would do
that
hey today is the one year
all right well I'll just finish up on
YouTube here
um
and so the Cyber Symposium isn't going
too well
uh Mike Lindell tried to show his his
evidence but there was a CNN expert
there who said I didn't see any
he he didn't say the evidence was wrong
um
he just said he didn't see any
so we've gotten to this point
where Mike Lindell has done all this
work and at least according to CNN they
didn't agree or disagree with his
evidence they didn't see any
um
all right
I was suggesting today that we need
something like a supreme court for fact
checking and of course as soon as I said
that then all of the
well I won't insult people but there
there's a certain type of thinking
uh
was it uh
who called this snap to grid Eric
Weinstein snapped to grid thinking
where if you give anybody any Nuance
about anything they can't handle the
Nuance so they have to snap it to the
closest grid that's something they do
understand
so I think I'm not sure if he uses it in
the same context but I like that analogy
um
so a lot of people said wait a supreme
court for fact checking you mean like
the ministry of Truth
Scott you mean like the ministry of
truth that's really what you're
recommending
to which I say
no that's what we have now
the the ministry of Truth is the current
situation
where the the powers that be tell you
what's true
and your side says oh yeah I guess
that's true and then the other side says
it's not true so we have the ministry of
truth but there are two of them there's
one for the left and one for the right
so it's the opposite of anything useful
so imagine if you will a supreme court
for fact checking something that we
wouldn't have needed in the past and so
the founders would never would have
imagined that they needed a special
department for it but imagine if you had
facts that were presented by let's say
the media or even the public and they
could they could just submit stuff for
fact checking
and imagine if you will that the process
for arguing the facts was public
so you'd see the the people on both
sides arguing their facts you would see
the members of the fact-checking Supreme
Court ask them questions
and then when it was done they would
issue a ruling and there would be a
Minority Report
The Minority Report is really important
and certainly we don't have anything
like that wouldn't you like to see seven
justices say well we looked at the data
and were let's say we're trained
economists or we're trained in
statistics or whatever and seven out of
nine of us say yes this is true but you
should know that two out of nine of us
weren't so sure and here are their
reasons
wouldn't that be way better
than nobody trying to figure out what's
true or partisans figuring it was true
now imagine too that you had life
appointments which is one of the things
that makes the Supreme Court work life
appointments so nobody has to answer to
anybody and you make it a high-paying
job prestigious so that people don't
need to take bribes
so whatever it is that makes the Supreme
Court work
we could borrow a lot of that
to make some kind of a not Ministry of
truth but a supreme court for facts
and don't reject it out of hand just
because you can't think of the exact way
to do that
um just think that everything that's
wrong right now
is because we don't have this
let me say that again everything that's
wrong with the country is because we
don't have a supreme court for fact
checking We can't agree what to do
now some of the some of the things we
can't agree on our strategy and nobody
really knows the future so you can't
tell if strategy is a good idea usually
but
facts we ought to be working on the same
set of facts so let's fix that it's
fixable you just need a better system
birth rate is following falling since
2007 and I guess a big part of the
problem is that children or parents
don't want all the responsibility and
all the work
here is another case where we have
drifted into a world that doesn't work
at all and we should just tear it down
and start over
the the average way that parents raise
kids in the United States
is so messed up
it's not good for the kids it's
definitely not good for the parents it's
just sort of what we do let me give you
an example
uh I might spend two hours a day driving
kids to school
two hours
because everybody drives out here and
there's gigantic lines you got to go
early you know it's across town
uh you know there's just all kinds of
complications to it that's just every
day
now that's all just completely wasted
time completely wasted time because
you should build a town where kids can
walk to school
when I grew up we just walked to school
it wasn't close I mean not that close
but it was close enough
well imagine building a town where there
are bicycle paths and it's safe and
lighted and they're say video cameras
and any kid even the young ones can just
leave the house with their little lunch
box and walk on the path and just walk
to school to be big kids there and you
know everything would be safe enough
so you can imagine like a hundred
different ways the classes would be
better they would teach better things
they could get back and forth easily
there wouldn't be all that paperwork you
wouldn't have these after school
activities that don't really help
anybody
uh you there's just a million things you
could redesign so we've actually got our
systems for raising children so here's
the the major point
the system for raising children is so
bad
that women won't do it
it's just too inconvenient and I
actually agree with them if I look at
what it takes to raise a kid today
versus what it took you know when I was
a kid they're completely different
and we were raised almost like you know
like feral you know
free-range chickens you know we leave
you know at a fairly young age
we were allowed to leave the house let's
say the summer in the summer you could
leave the house on your bike and your
only requirement was to be home for
dinner five o'clock that's it that's the
that's the next time your parents would
see you is when you sat down at the
dinner table now
I'm not saying that's a good or bad
system but I'm saying that our system
for raising children is completely
broken and if we don't fix it our birth
rate is just going to fall through the
floor
because having a child having a child
today is just really not a good deal
compared to what it was
um here's a provocative statement I made
that uh
the the least credible thing you can see
on the internet is the Rogue Doctor Who
disagrees with all the other doctors
now this could be a tough conversation
here I know
the Rogue Doctor Who disagrees with all
the other doctors and there's a viral
video now you're thinking of specific
ones in your head right now right it's
not about a specific one
it's about the category
because part of your risk management
decision is to look at the category so
let me give you an example somebody
tells you that they have figured out how
to make nuclear uh
Fusion work in their garage
with components that that they bought at
the hardware store
now that's a category of claim
that's always untrue
so you don't need to look at the details
I mean you should probably yeah maybe
you should look into them a little bit
but you don't need to
to know if it's probably not true right
there's some things that are in that
just category of probably not true
and the the Rogue doctor who sees what
nobody else can see only I have seen the
truth and all the other experts in my
field have not seen the truth and let me
tell you I've treated 15 people and so I
know what the randomized controlled
trials do not know because of my 15
anecdotal examples
all right now
um yeah forget about the fact I called
them Rogue let's say they're the the
ones disagreeing with the mainstream
whatever you want to call that
uh in my experience
I can't think of a single time
that the lone doctor with the viral
video has been right in the end can you
now I know you can think some of some
examples from all of history
so for example you'll say well for every
big change there was somebody who got
there first
so yeah for everything that we didn't
have right in the past but now we do
there was a rogue doctor Somebody went
first
but how about the last 10 years
in the last 10 years
how many videos have there been of the
Rogue Doctor Who was the only one who
sees everything the way it is how many
of them turned out to be right
you're once enough time had gone by that
we know if they're right or wrong
none
none right the so the odds of the Rogue
doctor being right are close to zero
they're not zero though
they're not zero so the trouble is that
they're very convincing
very convincing and somebody says Rand
Paul uh
that's a special case I I Rand Paul's a
politician who also is a doctor
I don't know if I would count that one
that's sort of a special case
so anyway um I would just say this if
you believe that that doctor you saw in
the video whichever doctor it was and
whichever video it was if you believe
them when they're disagreeing with all
the other experts
they could be true
it could be true
but I'd say the odds of it are under 10
percent
let's just say does anybody disagree
with that by the way does any disability
disagree with the sort of General notion
that nine out of 10 of these doctors who
have the secret and nobody else has it
not even attend or
right
so to keep that in mind
uh here's a interesting thing that
happened on the internet today there was
a Ken calanian who works for NBC News
he tweeted that at least 125 000 fully
vaccinated Americans have tested
positive for a covid
125 000 fully vaccinated Americans still
got coveted so what would that lead you
to disagree to imagine
about the vaccinations I sort of suggest
they don't work that well doesn't it
now here's Fox News
they reported that of vaccinated people
uh the total number of vaccinated people
who died were .001 of the total
that's called context good context how
about hospitalizations .003 percent of
all the hospitalizations for covet were
a vaccinated people
now that's data
so and and the comments were fascinating
because anytime Fox News is is on social
media especially Twitter uh the all the
anti-fox news people will come in and
say Fox News is wrong about everything
except this time that didn't happen
this time the critics of Fox News and
the comments said uh oh
did Fox News just get this right with
the accurate context and NBC News is
misleading us even the people who don't
like Fox News said oh this is right they
got this right
so uh of course I don't I can't speak to
the accuracy of any data but the way Fox
News reported it was exactly the way the
public wants to see this
right we do also need to know that 125
000 vaccinated people got uh coveted so
that's a big part of the story but if
they're not dying
that's the bigger part of the story so
the other day I was saying that this is
exactly how the news should report it
they should tell us the deaths and
hospitalizations
and Fox News got it right
now I'm not saying that I had anything
to do with that I'm just saying that
um they got it right now I've told you
this before
this is sort of a big deal
um you could argue all a day about CNN
and MSNBC and Fox News and you know
which one's the bad one
but Fox News is continuously better
produced
you can talk about the on-air Talent all
day long who you like who you don't you
do or you don't like Tucker Carlson
whatever
but the just the quality of the uh back
route what we do call them the support
staff The Producers uh every part of the
design of Fox News is really well done
like substantially better done than
their competition
so if any uh Fox News producers are
watching you guys kill it all the time I
mean just consistently you're just
killing it and I'm not sure if the
public can tell
how much of the quality of your work you
know makes it up on the screen because
you know the on-air Talent tends to get
the credit
so that was my
news of the day
somebody says Fox News is right wing
propaganda
well unfortunately we have a news
business that does cater to its
individual audiences so it can it can
turn into that yes
let's see what's to say
um
I think they care well okay
I'm just looking at some of your
comments here for a minute
Scott appear on gutfield guffel Joe
please I will do that
I took several months off from appearing
on other media because I just needed to
get some other stuff done
um
let's see
proof that Dominion election machines in
Detroit had Wi-Fi connections go to this
page nope nope I'm not going to go to
that page because I don't believe that
there is I don't believe it's true I
don't believe that the evidence exists
so I I do not believe that we have
proofs that Dominion machines were
connected to the internet
I do believe you could prove that it's
technically possible
but proving that they were connected
during the election or during any other
time before or after
um
so the question about whether the
vaccinations themselves are causing the
variance
I don't really understand that argument
um
don't understand it at all
because
wouldn't you get just as many variants
with or without the vaccination
if the vaccinations somebody do me a
fact check on this all right I'll give
you my dumb guy not a doctor not an
expert
thinking through it
let's say you've got a you've got a big
population and variants happen on their
own right so the vaccination doesn't
trigger the variant
it's just one part of the filtering
system that some people imagine allows
more variants to break through
but
um
so viruses mutate
but don't they view mutate exactly the
same whether you're vaccinated or not
why would it change you remember the
even the vaccinated people get the virus
so in theory the vaccination shouldn't
make
like I don't see the mechanism that
would cause a vaccination to increase
the number of variants because the
number of variants
I just don't see it seems like it would
decrease it
like my common sense says if the if the
vaccination causes fewer humans to have
bad outcomes it will cause them to
spread it less
there should be less variance right just
because there's less virus
I would think that the only thing that
causes variance is the total amount of
virus
and if the vaccination reduces the
number of humans who have a virus
doesn't that reduce the variance I guess
somebody needs to explain them better
let's see if there's somebody who knows
this
on the comments
so it says the vax filters out only
leaving the variants well
but those variants would be there anyway
right so here's the mechanism so the
mechanism that is suggested that I don't
think is true so so this is just
suggested by a commenter is that let's
say the vaccination stopped all the
normal virus
but it couldn't stop a variant and the
variant would break out
but the variant was going to break out
anyway right
because if the variant exists and it
wasn't it wasn't the vaccination that
caused it right nobody says that
we're saying that the vaccine vaccine
simply allows it it doesn't cause it
so if it's simply allowing something
that happened anyway
wasn't it going to happen anyway because
it happened anyway it didn't have
anything to do with the the vaccination
the vaccination simply failed to stop it
how does failing to stop something
create more of it
it only fails to stop it and with or
without the vaccination
that would have failed to stop it too
right
so I guess we need more information on
this
uh I see Ada Ade
variance forever the virus competes yeah
I don't think any of you know how to
explain that either so I'm not saying
it's not true
I'm just saying I don't understand how
it could be true which is a little
different all right that's all I got for
now and I'll talk to you tomorrow
