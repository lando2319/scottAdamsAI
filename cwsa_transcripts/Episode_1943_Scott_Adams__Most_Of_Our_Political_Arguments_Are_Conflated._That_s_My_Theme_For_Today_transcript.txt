today
good morning everybody and
congratulations once again you have
successfully found the highlight of
civilization we call it coffee with
Scott Adams because well that'll be
obvious
um and if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that well I
don't think any sipper has been to
before all you need is uh
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopaminea that tell you
the thing that makes everything better
it's called
the simultaneous Sip and that happens
now go
um
that's good stuff
well the U.S beat Iran
in the uh in this round of the World Cup
I don't know if anybody watched it it
was one to nothing
which Americans call exciting
wow there was one whole score so the
Americans have played two entire
rounds of soccer
and so far both teams well all four
teams involved have scored a total of
one one goal
so I was pretty exciting
um but I have to say the American team
looks better than I've seen
I haven't really followed American
soccer but is it my imagination they I
watched a little bit and you know soccer
is one of my passions actually as a
player and when I watched them I used to
watch the Americans it seems like they
would just clear the ball
that's all they could do against the
good teams I think we'll just kick it
really far in the direction of the other
goal and hope something bounces in our
way but now they actually control the
ball and have you know they play like
the Europeans so I thought the American
team actually has gone to another level
um that's why that's what looked like
that to me now here are two uh
observations they beat the well they
tied with England when everybody thought
they would lose
and England started by kneeling to their
opponents
so the so England underperformed after
getting on their knees before a game
I predicted that kneelers would perform
less than non-mealers for the obvious
reason and then Iran goes up against the
United States and Iran is playing for
their country
while hating their own government
how does a team do when they're playing
for their country
and literally hating their
country the government not the people
so I think the first the first two
rounds were determined by psychology
not the sports
does it look like that to you yeah
because the elite teams are always going
to be kind of close
it looks to me like psychology one
United States two rounds that maybe were
a surprise
that's what it looks like
well
um the New York Times says an article
that seems to be today that's
questioning all of the
trans surgeries for children
as Joel Pollock noted on Twitter
quote of course this all comes out after
the midterm election when Democrats ran
on the idea that Republicans wanted to
take away transgender rights and Biden
and Obama made ads with transgender
activists pushing the same garbage
propaganda they trashed science for
ideology again
that is exactly what happened right
this is yet another example of
uh censorship causes the narrative
the narrative
causes your opinions
your opinions cause your vote
your vote decides who's in charge
censorship is the only thing that runs
the country now so whoever whoever can
use their private Enterprise to squelch
freedom of speech most effectively they
get power
because as long as our as long as our
elections are close it's never going to
be about the vote
because if elections are always close
and they seem to be on the national
level
as long as they're close the things that
matter will be the rules changes
the rule changes maybe in Maricopa the
deciding thing was the reliability of
the machines maybe we don't know that
but maybe
and certainly the censorship
but as none of this was about voting was
it
the the thing that was least important
was
people's vote
because the vote was just uh Downstream
from the censorship
all right
um
about 20 years ago I'm trying to
remember exactly I I was at a dinner
private dinner
with uh some high-level people and one
of them was a famous futurist
Paul and I can't remember his last name
at the moment there's a famous futurist
Paul somebody
anyway
Paul sat next to me and he said
that someday
I'm looking to see if somebody knows the
name maybe he might have been there like
I don't know it was a while ago but Paul
said to me that when robots can make
robots
then energy will approach free
let me say it again when a robot
can make another robot
then very soon energy will be nearly
free
here was his argument
that when a robot can make a robot then
a robot can make lots of robots
cheaply
and then those robots can go mine the
materials that you need to make solar
panels
you know because robots would be better
at Mining and cheap
Paul sappho thank you thank you Paul
sappho is the correct name of the
futurist who sat next to me well and the
argument is that once you have uh
robots creating solar panels and robots
mining for the raw materials for them
and robots creating the robots that do
the mining and make the panels
that once the robots are fully embedded
in the entire system the the cost of
energy would start falling now this of
course depends on also having battery
storage right so the robots would be
involved in the battery making as well
so here's what's interesting
robots can make robots now
here we are so MIT is uh they're working
on a concept where they're making sort
of uh almost autonomous smart components
that can assemble themselves into
another robot
now I don't think that's exactly what
Paul was talking about but it's the
first step of robots making robots
because when robots can make robots
that's a different kind of Singularity
than when AI can be smarter than people
and make more AI
so there's another Singularity to keep
an eye on I don't know if this
prediction is true but it's interesting
it's very interesting
all right so robots are making robots
um so apple is having a tough time today
let's see what their stock is doing
see if they're getting hammered yet
uh looks like most things are up except
Apple
I don't know if it's because of the news
but the regular markets up a little bit
Apple's down a little bit
contrary to what other things are doing
all right so
here's why Apple's got some explaining
so not only did they cancel the airdrop
feature that was necessary for the
protesters in China
presumably at the request of the Chinese
government
so it looks like apple was bending to
the will of the Chinese government at
the same time they're threatening to
take Twitter out of the Apple App Store
which would pretty much kill Twitter
now
how do they explain any of that
I I haven't I haven't heard their
explanation
I'm not sure they've addressed those
questions directly publicly but I don't
know if any of that is true
but I don't know how they explain it
so I sat here this morning thinking you
know I'm just going to sell my Apple
stock I I started out with a small
amount of Apple stock several years ago
which kind of grew into a bigger portion
of my portfolio than I was expecting
because it was up like 700 or something
so it's it's a big decision like it
would be a substantial financial
decision for me to divest from Apple but
as of today I'm considering it so I
don't want to shoot myself in the in the
foot like I don't want to lose money
to make a point
but if it doesn't look like it's going
to go up
because people are mad at it I also
don't want to lose money so I'm not sure
exactly what to do
um I hold all all of my apples held in
my sap so I don't have much of a tax
implication
yeah well we'll see but I'm thinking
about selling all of my Apple stock if
if uh we get confirmation that they well
let me let me put it this way if they
take Twitter and of the uh app store I'm
selling all of my stock
let me put that out there it's gone
it'll be gone within a minute
60 seconds from the time I read that
news if that happens within 60 seconds
I'm divesting 100 percent
and that has nothing to do with money
that that would not be a financial
decision at the moment it's a financial
decision
so there's some uncertainty but that
would take me out of the financial
decision making and into the uh the the
Patriot mode like you at that point you
just have to defend the country
that's not really a financial decision
all right
um so Tim Cook's got some explaining to
do if he's working for China or working
for us
um
I mentioned yesterday
that if musk made a phone
there's a huge opening for a kind of
phone that hasn't been invented yet an
AI phone here's what I think the future
phone should be like it should cost you
one hundred dollars
it should have 5G but not necessarily
any Wi-Fi
probably needs Bluetooth
um
but basically it should be a dumb phone
that just looks at you and then turns on
so if you lose your dumb phone you you
lose it in the toilet you walk down to
any store you buy one of these generic
phones off the shelf you turn it around
and have it look at you
and it pops up with your entire data and
features because they were never stored
on your phone they were always in the
cloud anyway
so your phone shouldn't ask you for ID
you should just look at you and turn on
and
in theory I should be able to pick up
your phone
and it turns into my phone because it
sees my face and it should have no
access to any of your stuff but only
mine
and then when I hand it back to you and
you hold it up to your face it's only
you
now that might be a bad idea because
people could you know hold it up to
people's faces while they're sleeping or
something so maybe that's too far maybe
your phone needs to be your own phone
but I think that where we're heading if
you didn't know there's been a sort a
sort of uh
um a technical back and forth between uh
distributed computing and a Mainframe
right so when a mainframes were cheap
and well mainframes were never cheap but
what mainframes existed but PCS did not
it was centralized computing
when
when micro computers came out as they
were called
then we became more distributed still
with some mainframes but they weren't
doing the work that you were doing at
your desk
I think we're just going to go back
because now the uh the communication
channel is faster
5G is so fast that you don't really need
any of your data on your phone do you
your phone could just have a browser and
the browser could do whatever an app
does but it just does it fast because
it's a faster phone and a faster 5G so
speed is the only reason the app's ever
made sense
am I right from a technical perspective
apps only made sense to be at first
speed
but they also created this Market which
could be a gigantic market so there were
two reasons you needed it one was for
the benefit of sellers not for the
benefit of the customer but for the
benefit of app makers benefit of Apple
and then secondly for Speed
but if you don't have a speed problem
5G faster chips you don't have a speed
problem then you could put everything on
a potential server again and the phone
itself should be a hundred dollars and
disposable
right so I think that's where it's going
to go because economics will just drive
it that way
unless the monopolies prevent it
let's talk about dating during inflation
apparently Wall Street Journal had an
article apparently it's a big thing now
where uh
people are don't want to go on an
expensive date because dinner is too
expensive and the difference in income
between men and women is now normalized
so men are men are suggesting that they
go dutch
and you know you can both pay your own
way
so this is the way the uh the dates go
in 2022. uh two people who are
interested in each other they decide to
go on a date
they the check comes and then the modern
man says you know um we both have jobs
we we together we decided to go on this
date and we picked the restaurant
together let's uh let's split the check
now the woman being a modern woman
she doesn't you know she doesn't want to
not pay the check because she's a full
full citizen right why why should she be
treated as anything less so the woman
says I would be happy to pay my half
and then she says and after dinner I
have a plan
how about after dinner because dinner
went pretty well
how about after dinner I'll go back to
my separate home
and you go back to your separate home
you cheap
and that would be the end of the day
now
that woman would go home to her
apartment drier than November leaves
and we'll never see that man again so
apparently that's dating in 2022. that's
that's the new model
apparently there are still young men out
there who think
if she says yes to sharing the check
Home Free
yeah she said yes to sharing the check
I didn't think I'd get away with it I
think I'm gonna get lucky tonight
[Laughter]
I love young people
aren't young people wonderful
now young I I feel like you can make fun
of the young because we all were
I mean I'm basically describing myself
at 25.
you know that right I'm describing
myself
at 25 if a woman had said I really
prefer to pay my half I would have said
score
I think I really got a winner here and
then I would wonder why I didn't get any
sex I'd be like I don't know what went
wrong
I just can't figure out what went wrong
in this deal
anyway
yeah that's fun to watch
um
here's my theme for today
we keep imagining that we're arguing
with each other while we're actually on
different topics have you noticed how
often that happens
so here's the classic one
should Trump be punished for having
dinner with a white nationalist
Fuentes
so the question is should Trump be
punished for having dinner when he
didn't know he didn't know who the
person was the reporting says should he
be punished he didn't even know
okay you're all on the wrong topic which
is my point
is that the topic
the topic is not whether not whether
Trump is in trouble for having dinner
with somebody he didn't know was coming
that's not the topic
see if you think that's the topic then
the left is completely
Bamboozled you that has never been the
topic well it's never been the topic
since we knew he didn't invite Fuentes
and apparently didn't know who he was
does the conversation showed he had to
ask who he was
right now what is the topic can anybody
tell me what the actual topic is now
that we know he wasn't invited what's
the actual topic
guilt by association well in a sense
because the topic now is how will it be
handled politically
if you're saying logically Trump is free
because he didn't know logic has nothing
to do with this conversation where does
logic come in where does where does
common sense oh he didn't know he was
there so can't hold it against him well
how does that matter at all
in a political sense it's just a
political football
that can be used and is being used
correctly well effectively you can argue
whether that's correct
all right
um
but here's the real question
the only question that's left is did
Trump disavow Fuentes in a way that
makes you feel comfortable
that he doesn't agree with him
what do you think did Trump disavow
Fuentes in a way that would make the
average person say Okay I I feel that
you don't agree with his point of view
now and that's the only topic
and do you see the con the conflation
part if I bring up the point that this
is still a topic worth discussing
somebody is going to say but Scott he
didn't know it's not his fault so it'll
just blow over no logic has nothing to
do with this and that's not even the
point anymore the point is did Trump
handle it correctly so that we could all
feel comfortable he doesn't agree with
the points of view of his dinner guests
of course he did not not even close
the closest Trump came is that Fuentes
didn't say anything objectionable during
the dinner but if he had Trump would
have disavowed it
that's so far from being adequate
now here's my here's where I am on Trump
I'm not going to spend another few years
of my life
defending somebody who won't defend me
right if if Trump won't say I disavow
this guy so that my any association I
have with him doesn't pick up that stink
then I don't want to have anything to do
with them
right him him really like it's
the smallest thing that you ask if you
plan to be a supporter or you're even
considering it if you even plan to
support Trump it's the smallest thing
you ask it's the smallest thing just do
a Marjorie Taylor green did so somebody
said Marjorie Taylor green you went to
an event
uh that Fuentes was a host at you know
explain that and so here's Marjorie
Taylor green doing what Trump has not
done
and watch how easy this is
this is her tweet of course I denounced
Nick Fuentes and his racist
anti-racist anti-semitic ideology I
can't comprehend why the media is
obsessed with him
and then she said do you do you actually
report real news or just use CNN
blah blah and then have you question
Democrats if they denounce Elon imar
Omar
now
now that's that's entirely clear isn't
it you you could ask yourself did she
really not know who Fuentes was when she
went to his event
but it's easy to imagine that if you
spend a lot of time with online Politics
as I do then everybody's seen what I've
seen
and that's just not the case
yeah my understanding is that the trial
for
um
Alex Jones in Texas that a number of the
jurors had never heard of him
can you process that
that there was a jury trial and a number
of the jurors had never heard of Alex
Jones
so it actually is not that unusual
uh if it's true the Marjorie Taylor
green was not familiar with Nick Fuentes
that's not really surprising
that's not surprising I would call that
a coin toss
right like if you said what are the odds
that she does know him I'd say oh maybe
50 50. like he's out there enough that
people who are enmeshed in politics have
mostly heard of him but unless you're in
the top two percent of people following
politics probably not
I would say
Fuente's name would be familiar before
this event to the top two percent of
people who are following politics would
you say
not more than that but I think we're all
in the top two percent
yeah the same same with Andrew Tate if
you ask a general person do you have you
heard of them they'd probably say no
it's just an internet thing
so
um given that Marjorie Taylor green has
what I would consider an acceptable
explanation
now I'm not giving her a pass for
everything she's ever done or said I'm
just saying that on this one topic I
accept her I accept her uh clarification
because I don't have counter evidence
right like I I could suspect that maybe
she really didn't know who he was but I
don't know that and there's no evidence
and it's not obvious that she would to
me
so I accept the clarification how about
you
do you accept your clarification
and here try to be try to make your
comment independent of what you think of
her in general
yeah I do I accept it
all right uh but it's so easy the fact
that Trump doesn't do it puts all of his
supporters at risk
like Trump not disavowing this guy the
way the MTG did
puts me a physical risk
like I I could actually get
killed because somebody thinks that like
I'm backing racists because of you know
somebody you know somebody knows
somebody or something because that's
what happened last time
I mean I think I was in the actual
physical danger supporting Trump
but at least there was some payoff
before I don't say there's a payoff now
you exaggerate
Maybe
all right so that's what I think did you
hear that weird story about uh uh
Biden's uh Secret Service they rented
some SUVs for his
time at his Delaware home
say that they had five rented SUVs
and returned them to the lot when they
were done with them
and then all five cars burned up
they all caught on fire and burned up
now I'm no expert on car fires
but have you ever heard of one car fire
starting a fire in the car next to it
have you ever heard of that
oh he said Nantucket yeah I'm sorry it
was Nantucket not Delaware
so yes that so that's actually a thing
if a car burns up and you're parked
let's say whatever is a normal parking
space I don't know 18 inches or
something you're telling me that fire
from one car is going to catch another
fire car on fire
I don't believe that
yeah okay I'm gonna go with I don't
believe her for a second
foreign
even if they explode
I don't believe it yeah well it now I
saw the cars if the cars had like
exploded like a bomb where there was
nothing left of the car I'd say oh yeah
that that could catch anything on fire
but the car is sort of sort of like the
engine compartment looks like it caught
on fire
I don't know I don't see how a fire in
the engine compartment of one car
can get into the other car
because there's nothing burnable on the
outside of a car is there
and in a car that's not running it's not
going to suck and then it's not going to
suck anything in right
yeah and all five
paint tires I don't know no tires okay
but I don't think the tires were the
problem
Maybe
oh
okay I got it
uh the first car blows up the gasoline
goes under the other four cars
that was it right
it's got to be the gasoline
am I right
it's got to be there right
yeah that would that would make perfect
sense because if the gasoline goes under
the other cars and then ignites there's
a fire literally under each car and then
you've got it okay
okay I think we figured it out
I think we figured it out all right it
was a weird coincidence but it probably
was one car
although I'd like to know why that one
car caught on fire
all right
um 13 Republican attorneys generals have
filed a motion asking the Federal Energy
regulators
to prevent Vanguard groups that's a big
Investment Company from having
authorization to purchase large
quantities of public utility stocks due
to its support for ESG
so Republican attorneys generals are
going after companies that are even
supporting ESG
like it's such a bad thing so ESG is now
literally being treated like a threat to
the country or a virus or a
it's actually just being treated like a
flaw that needs to be
removed
so good on that
question did you know that Glenn
Greenwald is going to do a I guess a
major professional
you know nice set show on Rumble
so I think it's going to be live I will
be live streamed
is there a new oh live show yes it'll be
live
so this is one of the most important
things happening in the world
because Glenn Greenwald is you know a
national Treasurer even though he
doesn't live in the country
and
Rumble is a National Treasure and by the
way I'm a I'm an investor in Rumble
small investor uh
but I think what they're doing for for
supporting free speech
is fundamental
in its importance and if you add Glenn
Greenwald
who has often the best takes on the
corruption of our system
in very various ways you put those
together that's a super
powerful
entity
so talk about you know good news
coming up
I don't have an investment in everything
although I do have most of my money in
the S P 500 so that covers a lot but I
do have investments in some of the
biggest tech companies because I bought
in heavily during the pandemic that
turned out not to be such a good
long-term strategy they all went up and
then they went down
all right
um
the musk is dumping on Sam Harris some
more I think he tweeted this once before
but in response to a tweet about Sam
Harris leaving Twitter I guess uh Elon
Musk said Sam used to be so rational
there is such a thing as too much
meditations
I think he said that before but it made
me laugh the last time there's such a
thing as too much meditation he
destroyed his brain by over meditating
and then he goes Elon Musk says Sam lost
me when he said that any lies at all
would justify Trump losing
like that and I think a lot of people
will I think that's probably why
Sam decided that Twitter wasn't a good
match for him probably that situation
and then musk points out
that Sam literally wrote a book about
why lying is evil
and then he then he supported lying
if it could stop Trump
so you know the the most rational
thinker in the country couldn't couldn't
stay consistent As Long As Trump was in
the conversation that's how much Trump
bent reality
all right let's uh we're going to give
you a little uh quiz here we're going to
test your your logic your common sense
and your ability to read minds all at
once so now this is something that
people who
stop it
stop it I haven't even asked the
question yet and half of the people on
the locals platform stop it
stop it let me ask the question first
stop giving the answer before the
question
stop it
all right according to Rasmussen what
percent of likely U.S voters
believe that the outcome of the senate
election in Arizona
uh was not in any way affected by the
problems
at the election what what percent
thought that the problems in Maricopa
didn't really have any effect on
you're right it's very close to one
quarter I don't know how you do it it's
23 but you know probably two percent
error
so
once again the smartest audience in all
of the internet you can guess poll
results before the polls come out
okay a lot of people can't do that but
you can and
good for you
um weirdly as I was talking about this
uh how there needs to be a new phone
that doesn't use apple
um Jack Dorsey was tweeting that there's
an effort going on to build a some kind
of a web OS where you could have a phone
without apps
the phone would just work better with
websites
and then you're done
because the phones are faster now so
like I said as long as the phones are
faster
than the consumer's purpose for having
an app goes away
then it's only for the maker of the app
that is good
all right
what's going on
how about uh
so uh musk said he's already approved
the performance of Twitter
yes I'm
400 millisecond kind of performance then
if you don't know anything technical it
sounds like it wouldn't be much
but did you all notice that Twitter is
way faster
remember I kept complaining that if I
left Twitter open in a browser tab that
I couldn't use it the next morning
because it would pick up so much I don't
know just trash just sitting there it
just wouldn't work
and but that stopped a few days ago now
I could leave it open overnight and then
it's just fine the next morning and and
this morning I was using it it's like
damn this is really fast I thought my
internet connection was was just
hovering along and it turns out that
Twitter is faster
now here's the question I ask
was that something Twitter couldn't do
before musk got there
like what did he do different
that made a major technical Improvement
in terms of the user experience
do you think he did that or was that
sort of
already in the works because it's
probably
fairly major
fairly major
they were too busy they had too many
employer employees to get it done
well
um so here here's my preliminary take on
Twitter
anything we say about whether Twitter is
better or worse is garbage because we
need to find out where it ends up right
where it is now is not a it's not a
snapshot of anything
because it's it's moving pretty rapidly
toward being a new entity so if you pick
it up in the middle you're not really
looking at anything that's real it's
it's temporal but
we like to see how we're going
uh I would say at the moment I'm seeing
more anti-Semitism online how about you
it could be because of the news stories
are generating it but I'm seeing more
direct anti-Semitism online anybody else
I'm seeing only no's
really so you're not seeing users who
are just directly saying anti-semitic
stuff
why am I
why am I seeing it because I'm seeing a
good good amount of it not not just one
tweet
it's not who I'm following I just see it
in the comments it's usually just
comment
and it's usually a comment to you know
some generic public person
huh
so you're not seeing it
I wonder if that's I wonder how much
that confirmation biased on my part
because it's less likely that you would
all have all have confirmation bias
right
could be could be more of the topics
that I've been interacting with possibly
I don't know uh it's an open question
all right
um
uh
uh so two of The Oath Keepers were
convicted
and they were convicted of
uh
conspiring and plotting to take over the
company country
now I didn't follow the trial
but did you know that conspiring and
plotting are illegal
at what point does talking about stuff
become illegal
like
like if if all of the conspiring
happened within their organization
and then nobody nobody put it into
operation
it's not something I'm comfortable with
have happening
but where is the crime
where's the crime
how much did they have to stretch the
Constitution or the or the law to put a
crime around that
because to me I thought a bunch of guys
sitting in a room talking about
anything is legal
is not you can't talk about stuff
without getting arrested if it's the
wrong stuff
I thought talking was always legal like
how how much of the plan has to be
implemented
sure of a crime being committed
before that talking becomes a crime
itself
I don't understand exactly the situation
but I'm not comfortable with it so it's
it's not a situation that I look at and
say oh Justice was served
now just to be clear I don't want The
Oath Keepers trying to overcome
overthrow the government
but I don't think that ever was
happening
I I see no evidence that they meant that
all evidence suggests that they did mean
to delay their certification
where was the evidence that they plan to
take over the government
if the only thing they were doing was
delaying a process to improve the result
it doesn't look like justice to me but I
don't know if there's you know the
reporting didn't tell me what it was
exactly they did it was so bad
right now obviously it's so bad from a
you know logical level but it has to be
bad illegal too
to go to jail
yeah
um so we'll watch that roads and Megs
two people got convicted 20-year maximum
prison centers on the charge of
seditious conspiracy
yeah I just doubt that that was Justice
I don't know
but given everything we know about
everything I just doubt that Justice was
served
all right so I guess the respect for
Marriage Act looks like it's passed
and I guess I was blind to the fact
that if you were legally married in one
state and you moved to another state you
wouldn't be legally married but let's
say it's a gay marriage did you know
that
I didn't know that the states did not
recognize a legal marriage from another
state
so I'm actually glad that they made this
consistent does anybody have a problem
with that
because I think this is just a technical
fix
to something that I thought I should
have done in the first place
a theory
I think it's wrong
you think it's fed overreach because the
states
now you know but there's a there's a
let's see if there's an analog to this
there are there are other laws
that work for other states right if I
get a driver's license in one state I
can use it in another state is that a
federal law or did every state agree to
that
give me a fact check
why is it that my driver's license is
valid in another state
because every state agreed or it's a
federal law
States agreed do you think every state
yeah
Constitution requires it because it
would be different treatment or
something
I don't know
so we actually got all 50 states to
agree to that
Maybe
yeah maybe that would be a better way to
go wouldn't it
but uh I I think I agree with the
federal government in this case
I like the federal government's stepping
in when there's something about this
situation that makes it not a good fit
for the states
right and I think that um
a basic appeal to Justice
require the federal government to do
this
because no matter what you think of gay
marriage you have to know it's up
to let them get married and then
suddenly treat them like they're
unmarried because they move across if
they move five miles in America right
just because you moved over a state
border suddenly you're not married
do you think that's good for anything
like who benefits from that there's no
benefit from that nobody wins from that
because we're not going backwards like
if you thought that was the beginning of
oh now I'll dismantle these gay
marriages it's just the beginning it's
not
gay marriage isn't going to be
dismantled it's here to stay and
so you might as well be decent to people
right
I I got the I get the conceptual
argument
you know states rights as a state's
rights is always a strong argument
just whatever the topic is always a
strong argument
but I think you have to put the
individuals above that little
peculiarity of our constitution it's a
peculiarity but it's a good one
the conflict between States was gay
marriage not heterosexual
right but but I'm only talking about the
gay marriages
yeah states rights facilitate a b
testing
but don't you think gay rights has been
a b tested
all right I live in California and we've
had gay marriage for a long time
I can identify
zero downside from that
zero I'm not I'm not aware of any
downside
now is there an upside yes there's an
extreme upside for the people involved
in anybody who cares about them extreme
upside
for the people involved and and their
loved ones but there were I have not
seen one negative thing have you
yeah I've not seen one
one negative thing why is polygamy
illegal well it's it's not really
illegal yeah polygamy is sort of illegal
but not really
I mean there's
I mean the polygamy is the legal part of
the marriage yeah you know politically
should be should be legal but that's
another another story for another day
all right
yeah what else is going on
so uh yay and Kim Kardashian their
divorce is final says the news and the
settlement is that yay has to pay 200
000 a month in child support
now my understanding is that Kim has the
primary custody
which means that she would be putting in
her own money right so it's you I don't
think that they settle these with a
hundred percent of the payment comes
from the one who doesn't have custody
right so if one side was ordered to pay
200 000 there's sort of an applied
doubling of that which is what the kids
cost
so four hundred thousand dollars
per month
is what the Kardashian lawyer has sold
to the court as the right number
four hundred thousand dollars
per month
um maybe it is I don't know but
um
it seems to me if the
man
all right so this is too personal to me
I'm too recently divorced to handle this
case because I'm just going to go off on
Kim Kardashian now does anybody mind
that
I I'm just going to really go off on it
right now
and I'll start by saying that I've
always been a huge fan of hers I've
never been on the side of saying oh she
just has fun and doesn't work no she
works really hard
and she's very smart she's very
entrepreneurial she seems very giving
she seems very generous and I have like
tons of good things to say about her
however
however
if somebody puts the final divorce
agreement in front of you
and you know that in the last two weeks
your husband soon to be ex-husband had
lost nearly all of his fortune or his
his future Fortune
would you sign that thing
this these are two people who had a baby
babies together
they had children together and
presumably still want to be in each
other's life for that
and
after Kanye's entire Fortune gets
destroyed
this
signed that agreement because she could
just because she could there was no
there was no legal reason she couldn't
and if yay agreed to it he agreed to it
he probably had to sign it too
but
that is so below
the level of a good human being that my
head's going to explode
now we don't know all the details and if
yay is happy with the arrangement no
that's the end of the story
so let me say this if EA is okay with it
that's the end of the story because it's
it's just up to them right I I would
have no complaint if he doesn't complain
about it I have no complaints about
anybody it's just their decision
but
if he's thinking the same thing I am
which is you just watched my entire
Fortune get destroyed right in front of
you and you signed that thing
like the thing was obviously negotiated
before Kanye lost his money right
obviously now he's presumably he's
retained many millions no matter what
happens but
but still it's a whole different
situation if that wasn't if that wasn't
renegotiated
that's just a crime
like that's just lawyers stealing I
mean that's terrible
and I mean I really have a visceral
feeling of a hatred for
Kim Kardashian because of this now it's
not fair because let me say as clearly
as possible
especially when a divorce is involved
believing I know this
the public doesn't know what's going on
we're dealing with this you know minor
little information that you know slips
out we don't know the context right yeah
I mean I mean tomorrow we can find out
that Kanye borrowed a billion dollars
from Kim Kardashian and didn't pay it
back and so you'd say oh well now that
you know that context it all makes sense
or something like that right
so there could be more to it
but on the surface it disgusts me
but I could change my mind if I found
out in something different
all right here's the last thing I want
to do is talk about Mass I'm going to
talk about not whether they work or not
I'm going to talk about the quality of
our news
so it's been two years
and masks are back in the conversation
have you ever seen a major news story
where they went through the pros and the
cons of masks and showed you the science
and had actual people knowledgeable
talking about both sides
no you haven't no you haven't
nope and so when I complained hey why is
nobody showing both sides of the
argument in a way that feels credible
a number of people criticized me online
and do you know what they said
Scott
do your own research like I did look at
this look at this information I have
that says masks don't work
and I said okay that's that's a
different topic you're on the topic of
do masks work
I'm on the topic of why does our media
not help us with this decision
and those two things get conflated and
then I'm an because somebody
doesn't know he's on the wrong topic
like half of my conversations lately
have turned into
I know you think you disagreeing with me
but you're not even on the same topic
right you're talking about whether they
work
I'm talking about whether anybody helped
us with a decision
different topic sorry
so
watch how many times you think you're
having a disagreement when you're just
on the wrong topic
yeah
and in case you're wondering I'm
anti-mask big time
and I don't know what the science is I
don't know but I know it didn't show up
in any of the big numbers right
so I don't care what your study says it
didn't show up in the overall death
count I don't think
that I'm aware of but you know how would
I be aware of it since nobody helped us
with that information
um
so people are mad that Twitter is
reversed this policy
on covid disinformation so it used to be
the old Twitter would try to stop
anything they thought was disinformation
and now any information on the topic
will be allowed
true or false now
the people who say my God
this is going to be bad
how did they go through the entire
pandemic without noticing that all of
the information was wrong
how did that happen
it was it was all wrong
all of it
who in the world thinks that they can
determine the part that was right
if the experts couldn't figure out what
was right how are you going to figure it
out doing your own research
on what the experts can't agree on
yeah yeah it's a it's an absurd
conversation because once again people
are saying should we or should we not
have this Twitter policy
and it's the wrong topic
the topic is was any of our information
right ever like how could you possibly
know what is disinformation in today's
environment right again we're not really
on the same topic but we act like we are
that's the theme for today
all right
uh
I was I was asked this uh question a few
times so uh David sacks
was on Tucker last night and he was
tweeting and I think he came up with it
at least he's the one talking about it
that uh Maga has a new meaning now
m-a-g-a it stands for Microsoft Apple
Google and Amazon which he calls the
tech Maga now there are there are other
tech companies but they don't they don't
work
I guess you could add
Twitter and then it would be maggot just
like the Democrats say okay but anyway
he leaves out Facebook so that the the
acronym works
um
so
so David sax point is that the tech Maga
are basically suppressing free speech
and freedom Etc
and
so people ask me is it uh is that
persuasive
is it persuasive that there's now like a
tech Mega so Mega works both ways it
works on the
uh
yeah we'll we'll see I did that comic I
already did that comic
um
I think it's I think it's kind of
effective because here's the thing when
the left makes a word
toxic
it stays toxic
so if you start using that toxicity
against them the toxicity stays with it
a little bit so it probably does work
pretty good
um
so apparently a bunch of high Mar
systems these accurate missile systems
have been delivered to Ukraine
and
they're getting some from France France
has aversion we have a version yeah
here's the here's the question the high
bar systems are unique
because they don't miss
like they hit what they're shooting at
you don't need many of those do you
like the the whole uh deal of war is
everybody's shooting and missing but if
you can actually hit the thing you're
aiming for you win
right
if the high Mar systems basically don't
miss
and the Russians are digging in for the
winter
what the hell is going to be left of the
Russians
how could there be anything left
because if you can if you can take out
the most important assets you know their
food their I don't know ammunition take
out their launching platforms whatever
if if you could hit them all
and the rockets keep coming in because
we're probably making more missiles all
the time
unless yeah unless they run out of
missiles and I don't think they will
because we must be making them like
crazy by this point unless they run out
of missiles how do they lose
troops are too spread out the troops are
spread out but not their assets
right because you're always going to
have headquarters
you're only probably I mean the boss has
to be somewhere you're always going to
have food storage you're always going to
have
um you know weapons depots
you're always going to have big uh
big missile launchers of your own
yeah war is about logistics right
I know I think I think by the end of the
winter there just won't be much left to
the Russians
you know but of course they can
reinforce so it doesn't mean anything
in terms of prediction
uh
you are so off whenever I talk about
Ukraine somebody says you are so off let
me ask you this
uh my claim is that after my
disastrously incorrect prediction that
Russia would be too dumb to attack and
actually attack Ukraine now I was
certainly right that it was dumb
but I wasn't right that Putin knew it
too
apparently I knew it and Putin wasn't
aware of it so totally wrong about that
but I will but I believe that I am the
most right about what would happen if
Russia attacked
I I'm going to say that nobody in the
pundit business
no military expert no nobody was as
accurate as I have been in predicting
the Ukraine war
anybody disagree
now of course it's not over
so in the end I could be the most wrong
person in other words if Russia just
rolls the entire country in the spring
then I'm the most wrong person but at
the moment I'm the most right predictor
of Ukraine
as I was the most right predictor in all
things about the pandemic
now I know you disagree with that but I
have a long document that goes through
all my thoughts and if you take out your
fake news about me I was actually the
best predictor of the pandemic by far
nobody was even close
uh
uh you think Russia is getting crushed
well everybody does
yeah the Russian military there's nobody
who says the Russian military is in good
shape and nobody says that there are
zero people I was the only person who
said we would be in this situation oh
let me let me just test your knowledge
who else said that we would be in the
situation we are right now just me
I believe I'm literally the only person
can anybody fact check me
I'm the only person
Scott Ritter but he's
he writes for RT so that's different
I think it was just me
you know have you ever have you ever
thought about the predictions I've made
that are the weird ones
remember when I predicted that Trump
would change the nature of reality or
how we saw it
nobody thought that was a real thing
when I said it
here we are
the very nature of reality in every way
is being completely up for grabs
completely up for grabs
yeah I'm a rogue predictor
but a good one apparently
Junior says Scott predicts what he sees
on CNN
I I feel like you've never been on like
somebody who's only been here like 60
Seconds
uh
will women changing Iran affect the
supply of drones well I don't think
anything's gonna happen soon
in Canada every time you buy something
they ask for a Ukraine donation somebody
said
you have to be skeptical of hypnotist
Scott describing what he said in the
past well there are enough Witnesses
here that I think you can
uh you might just be good at remembering
your correct predictions well that's
true that's why that's why I do it
publicly
um that's why I do it publicly because
that's exactly true that I would have a
tendency to remember the ones I got
right and the tendency to forget the
ones I got wrong that's why I do it in
public so that you can beat my memory
all right
ladies and gentlemen
this comes to the conclusion of the best
live stream you'll see today I think it
was awesome I'm going to say goodbye to
the YouTube and Spotify and Rumble
people and I'll talk to the locals
people privately here bye for now
thanks for joining
