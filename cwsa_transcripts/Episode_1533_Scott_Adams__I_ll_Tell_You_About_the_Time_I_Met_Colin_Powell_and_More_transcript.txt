good morning everybody
and in a moment
youtube will be up to speed and
now welcome to the best thing that's
ever happened to anybody
anywhere it's called coffee with scott
adams and it's a highlight of not only
your day
not only your week and your year
but your entire life nay the history of
civilization that's how good it is
uh with talent on loan from god i know
what you're thinking
you're thinking i stole that from rush
limbaugh no no
when god loans talent
and then the person using it doesn't
need it anymore
it goes back to god and then god's like
well i got all this talent
got to give it to somebody i think i'll
lend it out again
so
i sensed an opportunity and i said to
myself where can i get all that rush
limbaugh talent that he was borrowing
from god
so i went to god directly
made a deal because i'm kind of a deal
maker
and now i'm a
talent on loan for god until he takes it
back
which could be any moment how would you
like to make this moment even more
special than it is i mean really how
could it be
but watch this
we can take this to another level yeah
you think you're having a good time now
you haven't seen anything
this gets so much better watch this all
you need is a couple of remarkable
glasses tankers style challenges time to
canteen dragon flash vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
feel the excitement feel the excitement
do you feel it chills right
this is the simultaneous sip
and it's the dopamine hit
of the day it's the unparalleled
pleasure and it's going to happen now
go
oh oh what's happening
i got such a surge of antibodies there
for a moment it was disconcerting
i didn't know what was going on
and but now oh i can feel it now oh
those antibodies coming online
i'll tell you
science has proven that if you get three
vaccination shots
plus a cup of coffee
it's very unlikely you'll die from cohen
have you heard that this is the newest
science
if you have three vaccination shots
or natural immunity
plus vaccinations
and a cup of coffee
your odds of dying from covid
so small
i wouldn't even worry about it yeah
that's how good it is
i just saw that there's a company called
framery
selling a product
that the world needs desperately
it's a cubicle for your house
it's actually like a
an enlarged phone booth a silent chamber
so you can make your phone calls without
having to hear the rest of the
family i guess do your zoom calls in
there too
that's right
it's about time somebody made a cubicle
for your house
because the only thing
good about working at home well actually
there's lots of things good about
working home but it does get you out of
the cubicle
until you buy a cubicle for your home
and put yourself back in it
oh i can't stand being outside of the
cubicle i need one for my home
i have to admit
i kind of liked how it looked
thinking and getting one
because for all those phone calls you
make that you don't want anybody to hear
pretty good pretty good idea
well china launched a hypersonic
nuclear missile into
low orbit i guess
or did they or did they
well we have two versions of the story
one is that they were testing a
nuclear missile that would go into space
and it would be hard to track
and hard to thwart if you're the
opponent but when asked about it china
said that's no
that's no weapon
that's just a rocket we're just testing
a spacecraft
so
what was it
was it a
nuclear weapon they were testing
or were they just doing some space
testing
testing on a spacecraft
or
is it really the same thing
is it the same thing
because it seems to me that if you got
really good at sending a spacecraft into
low earth orbit
you could send something else into low
earth orbit couldn't you
couldn't yeah
so i'm not so sure that the either or of
it's a
spacecraft versus it's a weapon
not so different
now remember i told you that uh we can't
possibly have any hope of
having some power in space
unless we have a robust nuclear energy
program
domestically because you would need that
skill set
to build nuclear engines that power
space and you're not going to have you
know it's not going to be wind power in
space etc it's going to be nuclear
so
once once congress heard
let me ask you this
one of the things i tried to add to the
nuclear energy conversation
is the notion that
you had to do it for
uh defense purposes
for military purposes
you absolutely had to have a strong
nuclear energy program domestically
because you had to build that skill set
to take it into space and if you give up
space you've given up everything
in the long run
so
was there ever a chance
that we would not go as strong for
nuclear energy domestically the answer
is there wasn't
it was always going to go in this
direction
but it took
it would require
that the stuff that you know elon musk
is doing and
and jeff bezos is doing and
richard branson it would require that
activity
to make us hyper aware that space is
important strategically
so that happened right so we had so much
attention about these low earth you know
low orbit
stuff but now we're all thinking about
going to mars and everything and that's
all that's all uh musk that's all bezos
that's all uh richard branson mostly
musk i think
so
once you knew
that we would be thinking about really
colonizing space and not just
around a little bit there but getting
serious about having a space presence
once that was a given
it was guaranteed
that we would have to have a domestic
nuclear program that was quite robust
and it would have to be re reinvigorated
because the the military
the military requirement
is uh it's it's an open and shut
discussion you know as soon as you take
somebody who knows what they're talking
about and i'll bet this happened by the
way
i'll bet you somewhere in congress
there was a general
who said this to congress probably in
direct language some version of we need
to have a domestic energy program for
nuclear
or just give up
because the alternative is you just give
up being a superpower that's it it's
binary
you either have that capability or you
just stop being a superpower
20 years out or whenever it happens
so there was no chance it was going to
go any other way but i hope that those
advocating for it made it happen faster
um i'm going to have a
little recorded interview with bjorn
lomborg
this week
i'll release it probably
pretty quickly after i make it
and he also is one of the first people
talking about climate change and the
economics of it
so
that'll be interesting sort of related
to this
um
i understand that our intelligence
agencies were completely surprised that
china had the capability to launch this
hypersonic
spacecraft and or missile
that seems like a pretty big thing to
miss doesn't it
really
our intelligence agencies really didn't
know that this was on the board
but maybe they did
and they just can't tell us that they
knew because
if
if china knew that we knew maybe that
would give up our sources somehow
i'm not sure we're surprised but the
public was
well john stewart is making news he's
got a new show so he's been
promoting it i guess talking to a lot of
people is it my imagination or is
jon stewart
didn't he just push bill maher off the
page for the first weekend you know how
every weekend
the headlines would be well bill maher
said on friday
bill maher said this
but this week it's all about jon stewart
it's jon stewart i feel like bill maher
is like the poor man's jon stewart
and now jon stewart is back
and it just like pushed bill maher off
the page because in some ways they have
something in common which is they're
both independent thinkers
who you imagine lean left but they're
willing to criticize the left as well as
the right
so they are very productive
productive people that way
but apparently jon stewart made some
news because
he was unwilling to say that biden's
doing a good job
he basically said nobody's doing a good
job including biden so
if if john stewart is lost
to the left
uh or as it's reported he pointedly
declined to endorse president joe biden
for doing an effective job and he said
quote i don't think anybody is
so that's a
pretty fair statement
but he's got a lot of smart things to
say and it seemed to me
that there was a giant opening for a jon
stewart don't you think
do you think he's going to run for
office
what do you think
i feel as if
jon stewart might be
might be angling toward running for
office
he's well informed he's popular he can
do the communication part
the right isn't going to hate him
i don't think the right hates him right
they might not agree with them on stuff
but he he generally follows the data
doesn't he
i mean when he's doing his act you know
if he's doing the act that's different
that's supposed to be biased
but i feel like he has a weird ability
to appeal to both sides if he wanted to
he could be dangerous dangerous in the
sense that he could win if he ran for
office
i think he has exactly the right skill
set
exactly the right skill set
could be interesting keep an eye on that
um
i saw a suggestion that we should call
the vaccinations
the ones for covet
shots
not vaccines what do you think of that
now we could call it the jab or the shot
but what do you think of that as a
compromise for those who say no stop
calling it a vaccination because it
doesn't completely vaccinate
let's just call it the shot
now doesn't that work for everybody
because there's nobody would argue that
it's delivered by a shot but then you
get out of the hole
did we promise you it would be 100 or
not
oh looks like everybody likes that idea
[Laughter]
that might be the best idea i've ever
suggested here it wasn't my idea by the
way this came from me from a gentleman
on twitter just moments ago
all right let's call it the shot
let's call it the shot
uh yes not my idea that is correct
that was somebody else's idea but i like
it
um i was alerted to a 2020 study so it's
been around a while it's a pre-print
meaning it hasn't been peer-reviewed
there's no
randomized control trial here but but
interesting nonetheless
nonetheless
and i want to give you like a long
wind-up before i tell you this
because it's about a vitamin d study
and latitude here's the long wind-up
i'm pretty sure that intelligence
is mostly pattern recognition
which is why i'm also
sure that we can build
artificial intelligence
that really seems like humans because
all we are is pattern recognition but
we're not very good at it
and we do it when we do it poorly we
become bigots and racists and
misogynists and
ms envious and whatever yes you want to
want to think about
so we're we have to use pattern
recognition because
that's what our brain is
it's like a lawnmower has to mow lawns
your lawnmower can't wash dishes it's
just not made for that
your brain is just a pattern recognition
machine and it doesn't know how to turn
off it can't not do it
it can do it poorly
it can do it very poorly
especially when it's about judging
people
but it can't turn off
now let me give you a story
that makes me sound good so make you
really disgusted pretty soon
but if you can't handle that you
probably shouldn't be watching any of my
content
so let this be a warning to you
if you can't handle somebody saying
i'm good at this thing but i'm bad at
this other thing
if they're both true
if you can't handle that because it
requires that somebody says they're good
at something
at the same time they're saying they're
bad at something else if you can't
handle that
this is not the content for you so just
leave now
all right so years ago
uh and i may have told this story before
some somewhere i was working for the
phone company and they were really good
at training employees and a whole
variety of skills one of one of the best
experiences you'll ever have
weirdly was working for the phone
company when i did they would train you
in everything from marketing to
listening skills to
reasoning skills all kinds of stuff
really good too and one of the one of
the things that they brought in was a
class we were required to take
on critical thinking
and decision making in complexity
decision making and complexity
so the uh we we were taught a uh a
rigorous process
where you'd make a matrix and you'd put
down all the variables and you'd
systematically rule out things like well
if if you imagine this was true we can
rule that out because of this fact
so it was about
ruling out things in complicated
situations until you narrowed it down to
what mattered
so we were supposed that we broke into
teams and we're going to work on a
specific um question like a a task that
each team had would have to work on
it was based on a real life event
that i'd not heard of at the time maybe
you had either there was an airline that
was trying to solve a mystery
that um some but not all of their flight
attendants were getting rashes
like a red rash on their chest
and they would get it near the beginning
of flights
and they were trying to figure out
what was causing it
and it was just just totally bedeviling
them
because every time they thought they
knew what was causing it they could rule
that out
and so we were given the task of of
figuring out
just the the way the airline did what
was causing it
and
and what we were supposed to do is
listen to this complicated story with
lots of variables put it in our
framework that they had taught us the
matrix and you know work for an hour or
so and we were warned that a lot of
people would never get the right answer
it was actually designed to be
complicated enough
that the instructor said some of you're
just never going to get it
but some of you might and then you'll
learn something
so we go to our breakout rooms and we
read the study
and the study
says lots of stuff but among the stuff
is said
it said that the rash was
affecting women but not men
so that's one clue
it was
affecting some flights but not others
so it was only women it was only at the
beginning of the flight
and
it was only some flights
other flights never happened
they would have zero cases on some
flights even with the same flight
attendant
so what was it so we were supposed to
look through all of the uh the options
except i read it and i said to myself
wait a minute all of the flights in
which it happens go over water
oceans
all the flights where it doesn't happen
are not over water
just something i noticed as a pattern
now they didn't call this pattern now it
was just something i saw it's like ah
seems like the ones that go over water
have the problem
the second one is it was only women
what's the difference between women and
men besides all of their biology
the clothes they wear
they wear different clothes
specifically
women wear a top which might be a little
bit open at the top
in other words the part they got
they got the
so-called
rash
was exposed on women but not on men
because men have their their shirts
closed so that was the most obvious
thing one was exposed and one wasn't
one was over water and one wasn't
thank you
somebody somebody's of course i'm
leading you right to the answer so it's
easier the way i led you to it yes
so the answer was
that the new life vests because they got
new life vests when they were
demonstrated and they only demonstrated
them when they were going over water
the women would put them on and it would
touch
against their open
um chest area
and they would just rub off so it wasn't
a real rash it was actually just
the color coming off of the preservers
now
here's the story
we were supposed to spend an hour
putting this into a matrix and go
working through this process
but i read the story and i said
huh
looks like it's probably the life
preservers
i mean i just read the story and looked
at it and said
looks like probably life preservers are
the problem
so
when the rest of the team heard that
they said huh
let's see if that would make sense and
it made sense with all the facts
so we said well let's just take it back
to the instructor and see if this is the
right answer
so about five minutes into the process
we go back and say we think this is the
answer it's the life preservers
and
and the instructor looks at me
and he said
you cheated
because nobody's ever solved this before
at least quickly i think some people got
the right answer but nobody had ever
solved it quickly usually had to work on
it for an hour or so
and he actually accused me of cheating
he said you've read this story in the
news haven't you
and i hadn't
i've never heard of it
um
and so
how often does this happen to you
the only things you get in trouble for
are the things you didn't really do
i almost got fired
you know it actually became sort of like
a risky situation
because it looked like i'd done
something pretty sketchy which i hadn't
i just read it and it looks like it's
the life preservers to me
now
take this story
all right this is just a priming story
as has nothing directly to do with what
i'm going to talk about next except for
the priming part
when the pandemic struck
and i think many of you can be my
witness for this right so i need a
witness for this
because without a witness you're never
going to believe it
at the very beginning of the pandemic
i looked at where it was happening and
who was getting hit the hardest and said
to myself
this looks a lot like a vitamin d
problem
because it looks like all the places
have vitamin d
are getting hit and that would include
places with lots of pollution
like wuhan and like
iran
tehran for example
and then when you looked at places like
at the time we thought sweden was doing
better that's questionable
but at the time
people said hey but what about sweden
you know where is their vitamin d you
should be low because of their their
latitude right but it turns out they
supplement
you so we the swedes all supplement
because they have low vitamin d
so the the outcome is that they're
probably have pretty good vitamin d
because they supplement
and so others notice the same right
i think others maybe made the same
observation
but apparently it's
there's at least this one preprint study
so remember preprint study is the lowest
level of credibility everybody got that
it's the lowest level of credibility the
highest level being the randomized
controlled trials which was not this
so a study looked at uh this was in 2020
and it looked at a bunch of stuff and
did find
almost a perfect correlation between
latitude and vitamin d levels and
outcomes
one that's so strong that would be hard
to imagine it was anything else now what
we don't know is the causation
right because it could be it could be
correlation without causation
but there is some some newer newer
information that does suggest that
causation is
is uh suggested
so we'll see
i would say that's still unconfirmed but
in terms of uh pattern recognition
um the vitamin d thing looked exactly
like the life preserver thing you just
look at it you go i don't know i feel
like i see a pattern here
i can't say it's right yet
now take that same pattern recognition
and apply it to a few other things
do you remember as i've bragged too
often that i predicted that there was no
sonic weapon with the havana syndrome
what was the basis of my prediction
that there was no secret weapon with the
havana syndrome story the basis was
pattern recognition
it was pattern recognition because i've
seen that pattern
and if you studied um
mass hysteria
they're kind of easy to spot
it's just a pattern
so i just spotted it easily do you
remember when
i had the
the weird prediction
that the las vegas shooter
was not isis
when the news was saying you know this
sort of looks like an isis attack
and then isis claimed credit they
claimed responsibility for it
isis actually said it was us and what
did i say
no it isn't
that was after isis said it was them
they claimed credit and they they just
don't do that
isis is not someone a group that
typically
typically they don't claim credit but
what pattern did i see
the pattern i saw is they don't do that
kind of attack
it just didn't look like an isis attack
it was just pattern recognition and so i
stuck with my pattern recognition turned
out to be right
so
um i'm pretty sure we can make an
artificial intelligence that can do
pattern recognition at least as well as
people
because we're just not very good at it
yeah somebody in bradley is saying isis
in vegas
what were the odds that these highly
religious people would pick las vegas to
go spend some time and then do a murder
i mean it didn't make it just didn't
have any isis pattern to it whatsoever
all right so look for your patterns
um
i say no vaccination without
representation
i'm i'm just so proud of that
that if you don't mind can i have
permission to pat myself on the back
no vaccination without representation
i'll talk about it in a minute
come on
come on that's good
no faxation without representation
all right
here's the context
one of our leaders senator bill cassidy
republican
he's a physician
so it's important that you know he's not
only a senator but a physician
and he did an interview and said he
favors cognition tests for aging leaders
in all three branches of government
dr bill cassidy
a physician
recommends cognitive tests for aging
leaders and all three branches of
government as a as a basic
system you know to do it on a regular
basis
to which i say standing ovation
standing ovation
for bill cassidy
republican senator
saying and doing the right stuff
thank you
thank you bill cassidy and further i
would like to say
if we don't know if our
leaders are competent
and we don't do we because they're
they're really old
pelosi you know et cetera
if you don't know that your
representatives are competent
can you say you're represented
right
are you really represented
if your representatives
are not competent or at least you can't
tell
not really
so they're going to give us a vax
mandate
so these these people who are so old
we can't even tell if their brains work
that's how old they are
they're going to force us
to get a medical procedure
well how about no vaccine
without representation
yeah i know i try not to swear but
sometimes you just have to
you just have to
come on you just have to sometimes
i think it's completely fair i in the
context of the government asking you to
get a vaccination mandate
a mandate
how about them getting a little mandated
medical
procedure
a little mandated cognitive test how
about that
yeah no vaxation without representation
and until you've taken the cognitive
test we don't even know if we're
represented
because it doesn't look like it
it doesn't look like it how well has
your government explained the whole
natural immunity versus vaccinated
immunity
has they explained that well
so the public says oh okay i might like
it might not but at least i understand
it
no
no they appear to be lying to us
by omission
lying by bias you know maybe not
directly but lying
lying in effect
is that representation
did did you elect your leaders to lie to
you
no no that's not representing you
that's representing the pharma companies
or something representing themselves i
don't know but they're not representing
you
so no vaccination without representation
and by the way i'm not
anti-facts
and i'm not pro-facts
i'm just saying you can't have a system
where a bunch of brain-dead
 are making you get a
vaccination and you can't make them get
a cognitive test
let me remind you
who has the power in this country
it's not the government
and it never will be
it's not the government
and if you let the government act as if
they have the power then they do i guess
for all practical power all practical
purposes
but i think we need to demand these
cognitive tests
i think we i think we've got to put down
a marker and say
i hear you about the ven the mandates
because
i hope i hope you would agree with the
following statement
you could be against mandates you could
be for them
but it's a fair question
it's a fair question
right i think serious people are trying
to do their best when it comes to this
whole mandate or no mandate situation
and there are genuine differences of
opinions about the importance of your
personal freedom versus how much you can
affect other people's
risks etc those are fair questions
fair questions
but
we can't even get to that question until
we have representation
and we do not have confirmed
representation because of the cognitive
abilities of our leaders and they have
demonstrated
a level of competence which does suggest
that we need to check this
right would you say that everything's
working so well
that you're like well you know nothing's
going wrong
so you know if it ain't broke don't fix
it
it doesn't look like that does it it
looks like some things are pretty broken
at least in the communication of how
things are going if not the you know the
data
so no vaccination without representation
we need brain audits
um the funniest story of the day maybe
although lots of competition
andy now reports that antifa in
australia
just had a protest
demanding uh stronger government
restrictions
what
do i have chocolate on me
yeah i think i do
um
yeah antifa
because that's what antifa is all about
antifa wants strong government
to tell the people what to do don't they
or is that
literally the opposite
of what antifa is and it makes me wonder
did somebody prank them
this looks like a prank
doesn't it doesn't it look like somebody
who was
mischievous
tried to figure out how could we get
antifa
to protest in favor of fascism
and they figured out i think we can get
them to be on the side
because they you know they they side
more with the left
and if the left is pro mandate
i think we can fool antifa
into protesting in favor of greater
government control of our lives
the opposite of their
stated purpose
so
i can't tell you it's a prank
but it looks like one
and as i've told you before parody and
reality have merged
you really can't tell a parody anymore
if you think you can
just wait a few weeks and see how many
times there was somebody kidding
that you thought was real
watch how many times you see it this
kind of shocking
all right
i guess uh the bidens went to a
restaurant last night and didn't wear
their masks
so they were the only ones at the
restaurant who entered and left the
restaurant without masks
now do i think that they caused a risk
to anybody no
no
do i think everybody should wear a mask
walking into a restaurant and then just
sit down and take it off
no
so i don't think that what the bidens
did was
you know a bad in a health sense
but
his only job is setting a right setting
a a role model example right it's like
the main thing he does
so the main thing that sells biden he
didn't do which is set a good example
so it looks pretty hypocritical people
say i i don't like the hypocrisy stories
because they're too boring and too too
numerous really
but i think this was notable
so christopher steele the author of the
infamous infamous russia collusion
dossier
he is in the news today and he says of
the
alleged
p-tape the one that says that
uh
that trump allegedly
watched prostitutes urinate on a
mattress that
had once been slept on by obama
and when asked if he thought it was true
christopher steele said he thinks it
probably exists
it probably exists
what is up with this guy
who's paying him
is this just part of the uh
you know the the long term project of
making sure that uh trump is
uh
trump gets you know stopped
at the starting gate because they don't
want him running again so it looks like
it's just a trump suppression act right
because i can't believe that christopher
steele
without being paid for it
would go in public and say the p-tape is
probably exists
do you think he would bother saying that
unless he was getting some kind of
benefit or he was working for somebody
in some way it doesn't feel like the
sort of thing you would say
unless you're getting paid
does it
well
here's uh
here's the funniest thing about that
allegation
you know trump is a germaphobe right
trump is a germaphobe
he only recently started shaking hands
because he had to because he was
president
but he's not big on shaking hands
now do you think that a germaphobe
said to himself i'd sure like to be in a
room with prostitutes urinating on a
mattress
that that's exactly the kind of fun i'm
looking for
no
now let me ask you another question
is that the sort of thing that anybody
would do
unless they were drunk or on some kind
of drug
no
no
if you if you got me drunk enough i
would definitely watch prostitutes
peeing on a mattress that obama slept on
there is some amount of alcohol that
would get me in that room
marijuana probably not
alcohol yeah
i'll watch some
mattress trashing
give me give me three martinis and i'm
in
but trump doesn't drink
trump doesn't take drugs
how do you get a germaphobe who doesn't
drink and doesn't take drugs
to be in a room with
with uh
prostitutes urinating on mattresses
could there be anything less likely than
that
could they have ever come up with a
an allegation that is less likely
than that one
that is literally the least likely thing
i've ever heard in my life i suppose
nothing's impossible but the least
likely
all right
so that's pretty interesting
i noticed yesterday that my grocery
store is totally gaslighting me
uh and
it really bothered me yesterday so i
think i reported the other day
that it seemed to me that only the items
i was shopping for personally were the
ones that were missing
because i would look at the shelves and
the shelves are full
except there would be this little hole
on this entire aisle
and that little hole would be just the
product i was looking for
and i thought
is this a simulation
what's going on and then i realized what
the trick is
my grocery store has full shelves
and they're out of almost everything
except they seem to have lots of fresh
food so it seems fine but the package
stuff
do you know what they did
instead of uh
piling things behind things
they put them sideways
so they filled the shelf with the same
product
and i didn't notice the first time i
went but this next time i went and i
noticed wait a minute if you take a
product
there's nothing behind it
there's nothing behind it
usually the the shelves are you know
several deep right
but they took the few products they have
and they just spread them out sideways
to fill the shelves
my store is half empty
and i didn't even notice it
so he says you just noticed i know i
know dumb right
like i wasn't really paying attention
i'm the guy who can't go into the you
know
into the refrigerator and find the
ketchup so that's no surprise and it's
weird that i see other patterns
it's weird that i can see another
pattern but i can't find something in
the group in the grocery store
um
you you won't catch it unless you stock
shelves for a living once yeah
all right but keep an eye out for that
there's something happening that's
bigger
now um jp morgan's
chase ceo jamie dimon who i would say is
pretty credible for
economic predictions
um
said that
he's not worried about the supply chain
in the long run
he says next year it'll all work out
etc but you know what else is weird
i didn't see any hoarding
did
you notice how different this is
when the pandemic started
there was hoarding like crazy
horde horde horde everything
but at the moment i didn't see anybody
doing anything that looked remotely like
hoarding
why are people playing it cool this time
is it because this doesn't seem
permanent
because it's not like a pandemic it's
just a supply chain thing
yeah wait a few weeks right
so we may be on the verge of hoarding
maybe but i would say this is i'm going
to agree completely with jamie dimon
which is prices might go up
but i don't think we're going to run out
of stuff because i think at some price
point everything gets solved
and i would also like to put out the
idea that
i think trump could have solved this
don't you think trump could have solved
the shortage of truck drivers because
what is it that causes a shortage of
truck drivers
regulations
probably
some kind of regulations which he's
going to get rid of
might be money
how did he make a project warp speed
happen
he gave a ton of money to the pharma
companies and said
don't worry about the money
just make this work
how would trump have solved the the
trucking shortage
well one of the biggest problems is they
don't pay the truckers enough
he could have said well in the short run
we're going to subsidize something or do
something you know maybe give i don't
know free health care to truckers so
it's like a raise
something like that
but you could imagine some kind of
executive order that trump could have
done
that maybe biden doesn't have the
wherewithal
or is too too much of a democrat to do
or something
somebody says it's the trucker mandates
yeah maybe maybe that's part of it and
maybe trump would have gotten rid of
those
but it does feel to me
that this is
you know i've said this often there's no
such thing as a good president or a bad
one now i'm being a little bit extreme
there obviously there could be but in
general
you have presidents that tend to be
suited for some kinds of tasks and less
suited for others
this is the kind of problem that i think
biden is less suited for
and trump probably a lot more suited for
in part because he takes more risks
so i think he might say yeah you know it
would be risky to have truckers who have
failed the i don't know let's say the
marijuana drug test if there is one i
assume there is but you can imagine
trump saying all right
at least for the short run
you can fail the marijuana drug test and
still be a trucker
i'm just you know brainstorming that
there could be things
that trump could fix with just the sweep
of a pen and wood
whereas biden might not like the risk
involved or just wouldn't have that
point of view that you can go in and fix
this stuff by getting rid of regulations
somebody says there aren't drivers do
the driving schools being closed how
hard would it be for trump to fix that
right
yeah i mean i feel like you could
you could
spring up a bunch of driving schools
because what do you need besides trucks
how hard is it to have a driving school
don't you just need a truck and maybe a
classroom
so this is like the most solvable
problem in the world it just takes a
little bit of time to work through the
you know the the details
somebody says it's about gasoline price
well that can be solved by raising the
price of
of the
or or charging more
so inflation is a problem that we don't
have an immediate solution for but you
can certainly solve
this stuff
the supply chains let me tell you a
colin powell story
uh as you know colin powell uh passed
away
and of course the big headline is that
he he was completely vaccinated but he
died from covid related stuff he was 84
years old
now
and of respect for
the general
i just
don't feel like talking about the fact
that he got infected after getting
vaccinated that doesn't seem like the
important thing
you know you're looking at somebody's
entire life
i don't feel like that's the part we
should be focusing on
yeah but i do wonder how many people are
waking up today and are hearing for the
first time that you can die from covet
even if you're vaccinated
this isn't new news people
we've known this for a long time
especially if you're 84.
all right here's my colin powell story
years ago
when colin powell had left
government work and he started his
speaking career
i was also at the height of my own
speaking career and sometimes he and i
would get booked at the same events
because i was doing you know pretty big
events as was he
and one day i was booked to speak
directly after him at an event an
industry event
and my speaker's bureau had booked him
for the event and they booked me and the
speaker's vero
person was with me backstage as i was
waiting to go on and powell was speaking
and uh the person who's with me said hey
do you want to meet colin powell you
know when he's done speaking
now keep in mind that i was
pretty young to the being famous game
you know hadn't been famous for very
long
so when somebody says hey do you want to
meet colin powell
i just thought uh
no i'm too afraid to be called a powell
because i don't have anything to say to
him and i'm pretty sure he doesn't want
to talk to me
so why would i bother him
why would i bother him you know with my
presence
so i so i first i'd demured a little bit
like
i don't need to meet colin powell mostly
because i figured he didn't need to meet
me right
and uh so i was just
being a little bit
uh i guess
i guess i was being considerate and
respectful of his time
that he doesn't need to meet me i've got
nothing to offer
right there's nothing that colin powell
needs for me
nothing
why take his time
but colin powell finishes his speech and
he walks
directly
in my direction backstage
and my
my uh let's say
what would you call a handler my handler
at the time said hey colin powell come
over here and
introduces me to colin powell
now if you haven't had this experience
of being introduced to somebody who's
really famous
you know
at the moment he was at the
peak of his fame and people were talking
about him for president and stuff
it's really intimidating
right
really intimidating
and
so he's walking toward me and i'm you're
having this thought as he's walking
directly toward you
colin powell is walking directly toward
me
and then when you you stop thinking that
you think again
colin powell is still walking directly
toward me oh my god colin powell is
looking directly in my eyes oh no colin
powell just put out his hand to shake my
hands oh no i'm shaking hands with colin
powell like your brain is just doing
that loop
so
here's the story part
um i was introduced as the dilbert
author
turns out
colin powell
was a dilbert fan
of all things
he was a dilbert fan so he was he was
very aware of dilbert and of me i guess
so he knew who he was and he was really
nice
and very
what would be the word
very
not approachable
but
from the moment
um he said hi
and i shook hands from him
the famous part disappeared
does that make sense
the moment the moment he went personal
uh all of the the fame
just disappeared
and in one moment
he made you feel comfortable
but i'll tell you what you didn't miss
was his charisma
his charisma was real
like even you take the famous part away
and the charisma is still there right so
very charismatic
um big smile
you know shakes my hand says some kind
words about my work
um
and it was awesome
it was awesome so the only thing i want
to add since he passed
is
um it'd be easy to you know throw in our
our uh
our criticisms of the iraq war etc and
those are all valid
but i would like to say one good thing
about him which is that in person he was
awesome
he was an awesome person in person he
was kind he was generous
and he made eye contact and he treated
me
like
a human being
and i'm not sure he needed to because he
was pretty famous so i just appreciated
him on a human level
um in my brief interaction
so
let's talk about natural immunity
do you think you understand the issue
of natural immunity versus vaccination
in the comments
how many of you feel you've got a good
handle on it
i just want to see do your own
assessment of your own knowledge
of
um and let's say specifically about the
question of whether natural immunity
should be considered as good as and and
give you an excuse not to get a mandated
vaccination so that's the only question
but how is your knowledge about that
topic
see lots of lots of people are quite
knowledgeable which is good
marginal some people
it's common sense somebody said um so
itty bitty
you made the perfect uh comment somebody
said is common sense
let me test that how many of you would
say that decision
boils down to common sense
obviously some people say
some some say no
some say no it's not common sense
well i'm on the side that says it's not
common sense
it's sort of a an illusion that it is
meaning that it looks like a simple
question
that has some levels that are not
obvious and i'll tell you about those
um and let me start with this
would you agree i guess there are a
whole bunch of studies
um so marty mccary is a professor at
john hopkins
school of medicine
and uh
so he's got credentials and he's he's
the editor-in-chief of medpage today so
somebody's really tapped into the
scientific and medical process
and he tells us that there are 15
studies that have demonstrated the power
of immunity
by their previously infected
there was a 700 000 person study pretty
big from israel um recently
that if you were
if you had a prior infection you were 27
times less likely to get a second
symptomatic infection i guess they had
to add the symptomatic part
than those who are vaccinated
this affirmed other studies and
apparently the studies pretty much all
of them seem to be in the same direction
that
natural immunity
gives you far more
immunity than even vaccinations all
right how many of you knew that so far
and somebody says natural is seven times
better yeah i don't think it's 27 times
but that's what this says
i feel like i feel like it's a multiple
but that 27 sounds high
um
all right
so if you knew that would you say it's
common sense
common sense right
if you've got one kind of immunity
that's 27 times better than the other
one
why do you need a vaccination
how many of you would say that is common
sense and we're done
if it's true
that on average
they throw you in a little a wrinkle
here on average
on average
an effective person has
way more
antibodies
and way more production on average
so common sense says you don't need the
vaccination
if on average
is just as good
right
jordan says is scott coming around
what does that mean
coming around to what
well let's find out
all right um so let's let me test your
common sense
so you all employed your common sense on
average natural immunity is way better
than a vaccination i think we all agree
on that let's stipulate that can we
stipulate it
will you allow me to say that on average
that that's just that's just
settled science
or as settled as anything gets these
days
okay everybody's saying yes
everybody's on board with that statement
that on average natural immunity is way
better than a vaccination
okay
all right so let me give you another
question that's based on also
your common sense
you ready
the people who are on the payroll of the
la lakers a basketball team
are on average
six foot five
the people who are on the payroll for
all the jobs related to the la lakers
are on average
let's just say the men are on average
six foot six four five
how tall is the guy who uh
cleans the sweat off the court
he might be a water boy too but how tall
is the guy who cleans the sweat off the
court he's also on the payroll
is he six or five
why not
oh wait wait a minute wait a minute
i thought common sense told you he's six
foot five
you just told me
that if the average person with immunity
is got you know way more than the
average person who's vaccinated
then
you know something
about whether each individual should get
vaccinated
but are you telling me that just knowing
the average of how tall people doesn't
tell you anything about the individual
what am i just learning that an average
doesn't tell me anything about an
individual
well my common sense told me everybody
was six foot five
we're close
you're getting really mad now aren't you
all right here's the counter argument
tentatively
what if
on average the natural natural immunity
is way better and i think we all
stipulate that that's probably true but
what if the variability is greater
what if the people with natural immunity
some of them have amazing immunity
but others have much lower immunity than
a vaccination on average
is that possible
is it
is it possible that
not all the people who get natural
immunity have the same amount and that
some have lower immunity
yeah it's possible
how do you know
what would be the practical way with our
current testing current technology right
in our current limitations i know it's
technically possible but with current
limitations
how would you know if your natural
vaccination your natural immunity was
the good kind
the really high kind or not the good
kind how would you know
you wouldn't know you wouldn't know
if any individual on the lakers is seven
foot tall
or five four three
you have no way of knowing if the only
thing you know is the average you don't
know anything about the individuals
now here's the question if you imagined
and i'll i'm just going to make up a
number now because i don't know the
actual number let's say
40
of the people with natural immunity
are a little bit too low
meaning that they'd be better off with
more immunity
more antibodies
what if
would that be a reason to immunize
everybody
because you don't know
if somebody has been previously infected
you don't know if they're in the forty
percent
they're probably in the sixty percent
but you don't know
and you don't have a way to test
you can test to find out if they have
antibodies
but you don't have any mass way to test
you know instantly to find out if
anybody's got good immunity
now
here's the second question
let's see if your common sense told you
this
is it true
that the more antibodies the better
go
in the comments
is it true just
always true is it just always true that
more antibodies is better than
not having more
exactly some people say true some people
say no
well now what happened to your common
sense
you told me that this was common sense
but why are you disagreeing on such an
important question
if it's common sense you'd all have the
same answer
yeah
so here's the question
if it's true that natural immunity gives
you more antibodies does it matter
or does everybody have enough if they've
got vaccinated
and secondly
if you've got some antibodies but it's
let's say it's way less than the average
vaccinated person
let's say you've got natural immunity
what if it could be tested you have
fewer antibodies than a vaccinated
person
should that person be vaccinated
now i say it's a personal choice so i'm
an anti-mandate
so um but but could a reasonable person
if they didn't know what their immunity
level was and let's say they're 80.
let's say you're 80 years old
well actually if you're 80 and you've
already survived covered you're probably
bulletproof you're probably immortal at
that point so maybe that's a bad example
let's say you're 60.
let's say you're 60 and you've already
been infected but you don't have any
practical way of doing if you're one who
got enough antibodies or if you're on
the lower end and it's better than
nothing but you might get pretty sick
anyway
should you get vaccinated
um
all right so here's the only thing i'm
trying to add to the conversation
don't trust your common sense
because it doesn't apply here
the things you don't know are if you're
looking at the average of one thing
compared to the average of another
that's not enough information
because if one is wildly varied let me
give you the extreme
so so this will be easier to you know
not everybody's good with statistics so
i'll give you an extreme
just to understand the math right but
the reality is not the extreme so let's
say that of all the people in the world
who had ever been
infected
that one of those people just one out of
the hundreds of millions who got
infected what if one of them
got
a zillion trillion antibodies
and all the other people didn't get any
what would be the average
right on average it would look like
natural infection is way better because
that one person
got a million trillion antibodies
nobody else got any
but when you average them together it
was higher than the average of
vaccination now of course i'm making up
the example but the point is
if you had wide variability in one thing
and narrow variability in another
you can't compare the average
for this decision
for other decisions yes
but for this decision you can't compare
averages and that's what you all did
am i right
am i right that you all compared
averages
and thought that you used your common
sense
and when i walked you through this you
could see that comparing averages could
get you to the absolute wrong decision
all right
but but let me ask you just
bring it down to this would you agree
with the general statement that you
can't compare the averages because it's
not enough information
okay have i sold you on just that one
point not going to try to change your
mind on vaccinations
not going to try to change your mind on
mandates
none of that
i'm just asking you
do you think that knowing the average of
immunity from one
and comparing it to the average immunity
of the other tells you enough
it doesn't
it doesn't now if you wanted to argue it
tells me enough
for freedom purposes i would agree with
you on that okay
if you're making a medical decision it
doesn't tell you enough
if you're making a personal freedom
decision
sure
whatever you want is enough
if it's your personal freedom that
you're making if that's your main
variable
then
i don't even care how much information
you have
that's up to you
you figure it out oh i'm late gotta
go
