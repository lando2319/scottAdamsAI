it's time for coffee with scott adams
always the best time of the day
and today a very special treat
i'm going to solve a problem that well
you've seen me struggle with and
a number of people have also struggled
with it and i'll walk you through it
today
uh but first what would you like to do
first
could it be the simultaneous sip because
if it is all you need is
uh copper mugger glass a tanker shell
steiner canteen jagger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure dopamine end of the day
the thing that makes yeah everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
now
[Music]
so as you know uh live streaming is a
big deal now and zoom conference calls
are a big deal
and a lot of people say what is the best
way
to get good audio on your
live stream or youtube or or zoom call
and i've been doing years of research
and i can walk you through it
now what you want want to have is a nice
substantial
microphone the kind that'll look good on
camera
you know you don't want a little weird
looking thing you want something nice
and substantial
you want to have a stand that is
flexible and
gives you the right height and you want
to be able to plug that directly into
the most common devices you would use
your laptop
or perhaps an ipad or a phone
so that's the things you want now
nobody makes a product anything like
that
so i'll tell you what your options are
and we'll start with the
the microphone stand there are a number
of microphone stands you can buy
and i'll just walk you through the
options you'll see this one
um it's a broken microphone stand
now you can't usually you don't buy
these pre-broken
you have to use it for five
ten minutes before it breaks and then
you've got a
what's what's called a broken microphone
stand i've owned
maybe 10 to 15 of these
over the years and they're quite
reliable five 10 minutes in
bam piece falls off and then you've got
yourself
a microphone stand that doesn't really
do anything
so this is actually one of the most uh
popular types of microphone stands and i
think you'll see a lot of those around
now another popular kind
is this
and you can see that this uh
is really probably the kind you see the
most i think
it's called a stand that's all loose and
doesn't really
work together and things fall off and if
you try to tighten them they don't
really tighten
and there's always one part that you
can't actually
screw in so this kind of stand
is what's called a completely useless
stand that's like a drunk trying to
juggle so this one will simply make you
very very
angry but you'll see this a lot that's a
very common kind of a stand
here's another one and i
just so you know i've i've used almost
every kind of microphone stand over the
years
this one is called the microphone stand
that doesn't actually hold
the microphone it's basically if you put
anything in there it's not really going
to work
so this is very popular the kind of
microphone stand
that isn't strong enough to hold any
kind of a microphone still
you can get those very popular here's
one of my favorites
and also very popular
this one is called the microphone stand
that is designed
to make you hate yourself uh all
microphones
live streaming and much of the the
creative world
and it's built so that the slightest
touch will knock it over
because when you're building a device to
hold something valuable because these
could be expensive
you want it to be the sort of thing that
just the slightest touch will knock it
over
such as somebody trying to relocate
their laptop
and it moves just a little bit and falls
over
so this this microphone was not
pre-broken
i had to use it for five minutes before
i did that
so this is very popular another kind is
the
the microphone stand that you can never
figure out quite how to get the
microphone and the
little thing here working
and if you did it would i think fall
over
or something and it never works twice
the same way
but in in any case these are only meant
to hold microphones
that you wouldn't want to be seen with
so
let's compare two microphones
uh here's a look at this one nice
studio quality solid-looking microphone
you'd be proud
to have something like this in front of
your face
so wouldn't it be great if you could
find some kind of a stand
that you could put this on or an
articulated arm or something
that actually worked two or three times
in a row
but instead you have something that
looks like maybe your children should be
using it
and you wouldn't want that anywhere near
you now
here's a microphone that comes with some
various settings these settings are very
important
because some some microphones don't have
any settings
this gives you one two three four
this gives you three ways to be wrong
for every one way that you might have
the right setting so
also you wouldn't want to look at this
for very long
here's a here's a beautiful microphone a
sun sennheiser
sennheiser and this has a very
unique features one of the features is
it takes a battery
so not only do you have all the usual
ways for things not to work
but now you have a battery that could
also not be charged
so that adds to your failure possibility
but you say to yourself well that's not
a problem
because you just look at the indicator
to know how
how much charge you need and the
indicator light comes on you'll see that
well then it goes right off but when you
turn it on you can see there's an
indicator light
so that you know that there's that the
battery is still good because the
okay you can't tell if there's any
battery life in it
so you're just sort of guessing before
you do the live stream but
very popular and it's also got some more
settings that you can have on the wrong
place
it's very good now if you're worried
about compatibility
there are a number of adapters for
example you could get
this thing that i don't know what it
does exactly but
it's some kind of an adapter you can
also get
one of these which you stick something
into it and then
something comes out the other side and
then it does something
it doesn't say what um it's an
adapter a multi-track
something about the latency maybe
phantom power something like that we
don't know which microphones need that
but
then also you want to get one of these
which is a
cloud microphone cloud lifter
because a lot lots of times your your
sound
will need sort of a a cloud lift to it
so if your sound feels like you don't
have enough cloud liftiness to it you
can put it through one of these
and then come out the other side and
it'll be very
cloud lifted then you can phantom power
it
run it through your saramonic and
um i think that will get you pretty good
sound but not unless you run it through
your adapter
that goes to the other adapter and then
you might need one of these things
i mean i don't know what it is but you
might need one and then there are these
other adapters too now if you get a
microphone stand like this you'll have a
number of different
adjustments this one i think has
three or four different things that
could adjust
which means that two and a three would
actually work and then the third one
would be something that doesn't close
far enough to actually hold your
microphone so if none of those work
then you've got something like this
which is a little mixing board
a road caster and look at all the holes
there's like all kinds of things that
you could be
sticking in there if you if you knew
if you knew what to stick in there
all right well probably take a little
work
but so
as you can see a lot of people were are
would be intimidated
by the complexity of this but don't be
intimidated by it
it's as simple as it looks so if you
wanted to
have a great looking microphone
on a nice dependable solid base
that's simply plugged into your laptop
or your ipad that feels like something
somebody should invent
because it doesn't exist in any form
whatsoever
but i'll be doing a little more
experimenting with this
today and uh i'll let you know how it
goes
let's talk about joe biden oh don't tell
me it is invented
don't tell me that because i know what
you're gonna do you're going to say
it's totally invented here it is
here it is scott here it is it's totally
independent
this just very easily attaches to one of
these
and then if you weren't an idiot you
would just attach this to one of those
run it through the phantom power through
the
yeah it's all invented it's not
invented
nobody makes a product that doesn't that
does this
i got i've got years of research into
this trust me
nobody makes this product don't tell me
they do
all right uh slo joe biden
uh said the following and i'm going to
try to say it
the way joe biden said it uh those who
say the
blood of liberty uh the uh blood of
patriots
you know uh and all this stuff about how
we're going to
have to move against the government well
the tree of liberty
is not watered with the the blood of
patriots
what's happened is that there's never
been if you want to
think you need weapons to take on the
government
you need f-15s maybe some nuclear
weapons
the point is there's always been the
ability to limit rationally
limit the types of weapons that can be
owned and who can own it
so here joe biden
is telling us that for somebody to have
any hope of moving against the
government
they would need happy heavy weapons like
f-15s and
nuclear weapons at the same time
joe biden would have us believe that a
man
in a viking hat almost conquered the
united states
by briefly wandering through one of its
buildings
so i feel as if there's an inconsistency
either you do need f-15s and nuclear
weapons
to overtake your country or you can do
it with selfies
and and whatever you can carry
like a club and some bear spray
one of those two things is more true
than the other but
we're not here to solve that today
in other news la county's sheriff i read
this
in breitbart
joel pollock wrote about this l.a county
sheriff alex vilnova calls for a state
of emergency
on the homeless crisis i guess there are
80 000
homeless i think that's just a
california number actually
80 000. and i guess calling for a state
of emergency is something that dr
drew had called for back in 2019
so maybe this idea is finally working
its way through the system
but i think you're going to need that
state of emergency to actually
force people to do whatever they need to
do to get better
unfortunately it's going to be treating
80 000 people like britney spears
essentially basically
too far was that too far connected
connected the wrong things but basically
it's 80 000 britney spears
people who we think are not really
making the right decisions and maybe
need a little help
and as much as we'd like these people
they'll have their complete freedom
maybe they're not ready maybe they don't
have what it takes
rudy giuliani lost his uh i guess he's
going to lose his
license to practice law or already has
and he's accused of lying
too much and too often about the
election
and i asked myself have lawyers never
lied in public before
are you telling me that if a lawyer
intentionally lies in public
they can have their license yanked
have you ever watched cnn cnn is an
entire network devoted almost entirely
to lawyers lying intentionally
they're commenting on the news usually
but
all you have to do is turn on the
television and it's nothing but lying
lawyers
and you're telling me that rudy giuliani
is the the one
the one who lied more like
how much exactly is the right amount of
lying
that you stay under the bar of you know
everybody noticing
the bar huh and and how how much is too
much lying
who gets to decide that rudy giuliani's
lies are a little bit worse
than whatever the hell you're hearing
every day on cnn aren't they lawyers too
half of them
they've at least gone to law school uh a
lot of them
anyway you you may notice that i'm not
talking about the
horrific building collapse in florida
and it's only because i don't have
anything to add to it the
tragedy unfortunately speaks for itself
um and since i don't have anything to
add to it i'm not going to
drag you through it because you're going
to see plenty of it today on all the
networks
and i don't feel that it needs any extra
for me it's a tragedy
and we're going to think about the
victims but
we'll leave that to the other networks
have i told you
too often that you can do a poll about
any topic and 25 percent of the people
who answer the poll
will just be whacked
and it doesn't matter the topic here's
another one
rasmussen finds that
56 percent of american adults think it
is quote unfair
to make women compete against
transgender athletes
i hastened to note that these are not my
words
because i'm pretty sure the way you're
supposed to say this is that
uh that people think it's unfair for
transgender athletes to
compete on women's teams does that sound
better because then you're allowing that
they're all women
so that that would be the uh the correct
way to say that
i believe all right uh
and but 25 think that such competition
is fair
now no matter whether you think it
should happen or not happen
is fairness really a standard that we
can apply to this
because the entire idea of sports is
unfairness right
you every team has people of wildly
different abilities
you know michael jordan on any team is
going to be wildly different
so uh who thinks it's fair
and what does fair mean in this context
so i think you get 25 of any any
of the people to say anything is unfair
in general so you just assume that's
always going to be the case
now i ask you this does it matter that a
solid majority of american adults
don't think transgender athletes should
be able to play on
women's teams
what do you what do you think of that
should majority rule
in a case where the the main question is
bigotry right
so the real question is are people being
treated equally
you know under the law and morally and
ethically and all that
and that's the one situation where
majority shouldn't really make a
difference
on a lot of things i would say well if
the majority want it that's fine
but the one thing you shouldn't let that
happen with
is anything that's in the realm of
bigotry right
that is the one situation in which maybe
the minority should make the decision
if they're making the decision for you
know more equal treatment of people
now i know this it's more than that it's
more it's more than
a question of bigotry it's also what's
fair what's access you know what's fair
to women blah blah blah so i'm not going
to make an argument about it except to
say
you can get 25 percent of people to
agree to
to say anything basically
ron desantis continues to be
the smartest republican um
politician and
he's making it look easy isn't he so
here's
here's another one and when i say he's
being smart i mean
if he plans to run for president and if
he wants to get
nominated by his party he just keeps
doing
all the right stuff to get nominated you
know
independent of whether you think these
are good things to do
to get nominated these are just golden
every one of them here's a new one
he signed he's signing a bill
requiring the florida campuses
to do these periodic surveys
on people's opinions and i guess
political points of view just different
points of view
so he's making sure that they have
diversity of thought
in in the campuses and schools in
florida
now that is so perfectly
exactly what republicans and
conservatives talk about
hey the real diversity should be
diversity of thought
so here desentis finds an actual
practical way to measure
diversity of thought now i guess we
don't know what he's going to do with it
you know once they can know if that
diversity of thought is there or not
but presumably he's protecting um
conservative thought and teachings
and i don't know if this is a good idea
all right
it feels it feels like maybe
it's got as many problems as it has
upsides
so even if you're sort of in favor of
you know diversity of thought and most
of us would be i think
even if you're in favor of that it's not
clear that this gets it to you
you know maybe it's just a little more
bureaucracy we don't need
but politically if you're just talking
politically
the people who support him republicans
and conservatives
they like this idea and he's doing
something about it
if it works that's great if it doesn't
work well maybe you try something else
but at least he's doing something
yeah this is one of the things that
trump was good at
he at least he'd do something even if
you didn't think it was going to work
doing nothing wasn't it wasn't a good
idea so just do something
if it doesn't work we'll try something
else so on that level
he's definitely doing the right thing
because he's trying something
i'm not so sure it'll work or we'll see
so i guess kabul harris is finally going
to the border
and the republicans have set her up
perfectly because they've been mocking
her for so long and
tracking how many days since she had not
visited the border
since she got the job of being in charge
of the at least the
the the i think she's
more in charge of the other countries
besides mexico
sending people our way so she's trying
to stop it at the source
but of course it's a it's a border
related thing
so she's finally going to go there and
of course the republicans will claim
the only reason she's going is because
they put pressure on her
now maybe that's true of course they'll
deny it
but it does sort of look like the only
reason she's going is because they put
pressure on her i don't know if that's
true
but it looks exactly like it it's one of
the main things that's in the news
and uh maybe they just said well let's
just make that go away
we'll we'll visit finally all right
um and she had only recently dismissed
visiting the border as quote a grand
gesture
so it's a grand gesture meaning she
mocked it
but she's going to go do a grand gesture
because i guess she got she has to
did you see the news that apparently
there's an infrastructure
bipartisan bill compromise and biden
says he'll sign it
so so we're all done right we finally
got that
uh compromised infrastructure built
well it still has to pass right
and aoc has already ripped it apart you
know i told you yesterday
before it was announced that there was
this big breakthrough compromise
i told you there wasn't going to be a
deal
now i hope i'm wrong and it would be
great if something like this
compromise deal or or some version of it
gets through
but i feel like it's not going to
i feel like it's going to die in
congress
it just won't get the votes so
let's track my prediction that the
congress
will be too incompetent to pass
something that has bipartisan and
presidential support
i don't think they're going to be able
to do it because the aocs of the world
will say it's not enough and maybe
they'll just have to give up on this
version
so nobody in the world
is terribly concerned about being
consistent have you noticed that
that there's something about famous
people
that makes them just completely abandon
trying to be consistent with any opinion
it's just
sort of you know they'll take whatever
side at the moment it makes sense
here's a perfect example this so espn's
uh jalen rose said that the inclusion of
kevin love who you need to know
is a white basketball player on the u.s
olympic team
is a case of tokenism because kevin love
didn't have a good year
and including him just looks like
they're including them because he'd be
the
only white guy and so
this is how jalen rose put it he said
i'm disappointed in team usa for not
having the courage
to send an all-black team to the
olympics
what what haven't we just spent the last
i don't know a few hundred years
agreeing that we should have diversity
everywhere
i i thought that was sort of a big
important message
but apparently when it comes down to a
basketball team
we don't need that diversity now i'm not
taking you aside by the way i'm just
pointing out
how can it be that we need diversity
except when
uh one of the teams is all black
i feel like you need to let that one go
right
now my personal opinion is you send the
best players
and it looks like you know i think jalen
rose is making a
uh sounds like a reasonable point that
based on statistics and anything else
they're not sending the best players but
if you're okay with it in this context
you probably need to be okay with it in
other contexts
or not be okay with it in this context
you sort of have to pick
right am i wrong
could you ever be consistent in saying
well everything else needs to be diverse
but not this thing would that be
is there any way to to justify that
opinion
i know so uh
a federal judge has ruled that joe biden
is a racist
did you see that headline i bet you
didn't
yeah it's true a federal judge has ruled
that joe biden is a racist
now they don't use those words
i'm i'm interpreting but let me tell you
what the interpretation is
so uh federal judge uh marcia
morales howard
so she has a preliminary injunction
against joe biden's plan
so it's joe biden's plan so if joe
biden's plan is racist
then i am justified in saying that a
federal judge
found him to be racist a plan to offer
loan forgiveness to black and other
minority foreigners but not to indebted
white farmers and i guess the judge said
it was an attempt to address
discrimination while practicing
discrimination
and therefore a federal judge
ruled that joe biden is a racist
too far am i over interpreting it
because the federal judge did say
it would be an attempt to address
discrimination while practicing
discrimination
it's joe biden's plan and the federal
judge said
that it would practice discrimination
which is racist in this context because
the discrimination would be racial
right so while it is true
that no court has found no court has
found
massive widespread election abuse
or cheating or fraud and therefore we
can claim that it does not exist because
no court has found it to be true
but a federal court has ruled that joe
biden is a racist
i'm not this is not a stretch is it
am i saying something that is not
technically
and as well as technically
commonsensically
literally true that a federal judge just
found joe biden to be a racist
what's it mean to be a racist it means
that you want different rules for people
of different color
that's what it means and the judge just
ruled
that's what you're doing it's not even
my opinion now it's just the court has
ruled on it
so can't we just say he's a racist
because the court ruled on it
and am i the first person to i i haven't
seen anybody
on social media point this out
feels like a big deal to me that a
federal court
has ruled that a president is a racist
now i wonder if that happened to uh
probably happened to trump as well
didn't it
i think it did happen to trump as well
but at least we'd be consistent if we
treat them the same way
so the the building disaster that's
falling down in florida
um is sucking up a lot of the headlines
as it should
it's a pretty big deal uh but it's also
taken a lot of the politics out of the
news
and are you amazed at how many big
problems
don't seem to be in the news anymore
let me ask you this um
is climate change solved that we salted
because of the you know biden likes the
paris uh accords or whatever
so is climate assault because it feels
to me
as if climate stuff was like the number
one headline
for like a long time under trump but as
soon as biden
and harris are in charge i'm now seeing
a lot of articles about the planet
getting warmer
is that my imagination does it seem to
you that there are far
fewer climate related stories now
now we had a little bit about the
heatwave but they didn't really
you know grind that into the ground like
you you might expect they would have
all right um everything the left talks
about is just a club
to beat the right with yeah it looks
like that's the world we live in
all right i don't have much more today
and
we will have to depend on the news
business giving us a lot more
stuff later today i'm going to be
testing the live streaming
feature on the locals platform
subscription platform where i put a lot
more of my content
and the first test was really good but
i'm going to test it from a browser
today
see how that works not available to
everybody yet
just be the test all right
and that is all i have for today and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
