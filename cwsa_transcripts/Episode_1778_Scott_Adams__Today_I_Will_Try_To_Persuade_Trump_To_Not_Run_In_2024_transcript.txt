good morning
ladies and gentlemen
wow am i glad to see you
because if i were not seeing you i would
be seeing people who are
less
attractive less smart
less with it less kind less
generous less gracious
and can we put up with people like that
when we could be around people like you
no
no not even a little bit
so how would you like to
continue our dominance of being awesome
in a world of mediocrity
i think you would and let's take it to
the next level with the thing i call the
simultaneous sip
and all you need is a cupper mug or a
glass a tanker chelsea stein a canteen
jugor flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine here though the day
it's it's just gonna blow your mind
it's called the simultaneous second
happens now go
so i was sitting here this morning
and i said to myself what can i do
to really
mix things up and
be interesting and maybe change the
world
maybe change the world into something
better
and i thought well how could i do that
how can one person
change the world
and then i thought
oh yeah i could do that
so a little bit later i'm gonna do it
but i want people to see my click baity
title for this live stream
which i'm going to deliver
i'm going to persuade
trump
to not run in 2024
will i succeed
let's do the other news first while
people pour in and that teaser
that teaser is going to leave you right
on the edge
yeah you won't leave you won't leave
when i said that
here's a question that i have for biden
supporters
people who supported him and then
despite what they see
happening
with his administration
what do they think would happen with a
second term
wouldn't you love to be inside the mind
of a biden supporter
who is legitimately thinking you know
i think the best thing for this country
would be another term of bidens like how
do they
project that in their minds do they say
to themselves
you know a second term would look just
like this one
and this is going great
so why wouldn't you want more of that
is that how it works
now
i'm not even trying to be you know like
biased
it's hard to understand
what exactly would be the thought
process
or would they say to themselves as
others might
well he seems to be going downhill
pretty quickly
and at this point the rate of decline is
probably going to get us deeper you know
it's not going to plateau
so in
you know six years or so there's not
going to be much left of him
but do the democrats who support him say
you know
i think there'll be enough left as long
as he can breathe he's still going to be
better than all the other choices in the
democratic party
and all the choices in the republican
party
do they actually think that
or have they convinced themselves that
they're in some kind of a tight spot
where they've given away all their
options
and it's just the best they got
they hate it but they're going to make
the best of it
which do you think it is
do you think they think it would
actually be a good thing
to have a
president who's a 150 years old
do they really think that
so
that's i'm genuinely curious i would
love to be able to you know get into the
brain and say
all right what i see what you're saying
but what are you actually thinking
like what's the internal thought process
there
do you really look at biden and say
yeah that looks pretty good to me
i i don't see how a 30 percent decline
from this point would be any problem
well you can tell it's the weekend
and all the people who make the news
the fake news must be on
vacation
because the
do you see how heavy the news is on
saturday
with whatever the hell bill maher said
on friday
night what's going to happen when bill
maher takes some kind of a hiatus he
always takes some time off right
there is so much news that is what did
elon musk say
and what did bill maher say
how much news can those two people make
apparently
multiple stories every single week
now this is one of those times when i
think i'm living in a
simulation
and it seems as if the simulation has
become so complex
because now they're you know seven
billion people that have to be
you know manage and ask to keep track of
all that
that i feel like maybe the simulations
resources are being taxed
and it's reducing the number of choices
for other stuff
because it seems like the news
should be getting infinitely more
complex wouldn't you say
isn't the world getting infinitely more
complex
and so wouldn't you sort of logically
say
it seems like every news story now
is going to be this wild thing that you
never heard before
because everything's just wildly going
and you know things are being invented
and things are changing quickly and
so shouldn't shouldn't you expect that
the news stories
become wildly divergent
like just something you've never heard
before
but instead the news every weekend is
what did bill maher say
and it's always even the same frame
that he criticized what you think is his
own team but
i would argue he's a more independent
thinker than that suggests
why do we have fewer choices
what's going on there
is it because the news industry has just
given up and for economic reasons
they'll just do whatever is the easiest
and whatever is easiest is watch is
watch bill maher
and then write an article on your laptop
while you're sipping wine and watching
whatever funny thing bill maher says
let's let's all we got left
because there are no real problems to
solve or anything
right but
that's all i've got too so i'm going to
talk about bill maher
so should we talk about what bill maher
said
that's all we got
that's all we got
but we'll get to the good part a minute
uh so i guess he torched the washington
post about the reporter who
made us think about a sexist sounding
joke and blah blah you know that story
so he was he was making fun of the
wokeness at the washington post
he also said that desantis would be
better than trump
he didn't back or promote desantis he
was just saying of the two of them
that desantis wasn't you know at least
not crazy
so again
credit to bill maher for being you know
an independent thinker because
it's hard
i would think that if you're being
honest
it would be hard to look at desantis and
say that would be a mistake
even if you're a democrat
now i get that he might disagree let's
say on abortion
might disagree on you know half a dozen
policies
yeah i get that
but how can you look at desantis and not
say
that he does a good job of representing
his base
and that at least his opinions are part
of a legitimate
political conversation
and i i feel like bill maher
gives him that do and it's it's kind of
refreshing to see
it's refreshing to see anybody who can
speak independently today
well
i keep wondering if the russian economy
is broken or doing terrific
is it it's so weird that we can't tell
because today there's some
uh cnn reporting
that the russian economy is you know
mostly smoking mirrors
and that even though sure the rubble's
doing the ruble
is that weird
that
the russian news is about rubble and and
rubles
it just seems weird
like basically there are two things that
can define the entire story of the
russian ukraine situation
rubble
and ruble
if you understood those two situations
you'd know the whole whole thing
that's just weird
i don't know
um
it's like the one of the founders of
black lives matters
correct me if i'm wrong isn't her last
name colors
and she was a one of the founders of
black lives matter
their last name is colors
like that's just weird
i don't know what to make of that it's
like
i
i saw a tweet by brian machiavelli
and he was saying that it seems like the
simulation is less interested
in hiding itself
i swear it seems like that
i feel as if
the way we're finding out we're in the
simulation is that whoever created it
is dropping such obvious hints
that it will be hilarious after we're
sure what happened
like we're all in some kind of giant
practical joke
where we can't see that it's obvious
that somebody's messing with us and that
we're part of some kind of you know
observational
game or science experiment
or something
and
i'll say more about that a little bit
but
one of the ways that uh makes me think
that that's the case and i'm you know
i'm being facetious here but
doesn't it seem that parody and reality
have legitimately
i've been saying this for a while
that the parity reality crossover point
has actually been achieved
and what i mean by that is you can't
tell when people are kidding now
because people can say outrageously
ridiculous things
and you would have to know
who they were to know if they were
kidding
let me say that again
you would have to know who the person
was
to know if they were kidding
you wouldn't be able to tell by the
words
you cannot tell by the words
but if but if i said something that was
you know sort of super woke
you'd probably say to yourself
i think he's kidding
but then he's also very pro-trans and
pro-lgbtq
so
is he kidding
we're not really sure
so even i fall into that category right
there's no escaping it
so uh let me give you an update on uh
the dilbert comic
so a while ago i introduced a
black regular character named dave
and dave's uh
characteristic because you have to give
every every cartoon character
has to have some kind of a defect
or
a stereotypical
personality trait because that's what
makes comics interesting that they are
meant to be stereotypes
but how do you do a stereotype in our
sensitive world with with a black
character if you're a white creator it's
just a little bit too
it's a little too sensitive in 2022
so what i came up with i think is
working so far which is dave the
engineer
and his defining
personality trait
is
that you can't tell if he's kidding
so he's sort of a character for the ages
he's he's perfectly designed for 2022
that the parody reality crossover point
happened and when the boss talks to dave
he can't tell if dave is kidding i'll
give you an example so so a dave cartoon
is running today at dilber.com i tweeted
it if you want to see it it's the top of
my twitter feed
and so the boss
goes to talk to dave the engineer and
the boss says
why is your project late dave and then
dave says
supply chain issues climate change
systemic racism covet and something
about inflation
and the boss says
i can never tell if you're joking
and dave says i love that about you
now this is actually based on
uh one of my co-workers from a million
years ago
i worked in a big bank
and we would have uh regular you know
office meetings once a week you know to
do status updates
and i don't think there's anything worse
than a regularly scheduled status update
meeting
for boring you can't really top that
and
one of the people who attended the
meeting he was one of the managers
his name was red i forget his last name
i'm not sure that red was his real name
because i think he had red hair
it might have been his real name but i
don't know i think baby was his nickname
but red
uh was probably the funniest person i've
ever worked with
and i've worked with some pretty funny
people and what red would do is he would
give his status updates
in jargon
but the jargon was all the actual like
actual jargon that was used in the bank
but what he would do is he would use so
much jargon
that if you knew red
you knew he was joking
but if you didn't know him
you weren't sure
and he never broke character when he did
it
and
i thought
i thought my face was going to explode
one day i wish i could do an impression
of it but if you can just imagine red
i'll give you sort of the visual so you
can see him so he was an older guy he
was probably in his 60s or so you know
with thinning hair and
uh you know he had met these magnifying
kind of glasses so that his eyes looked
bigger
than they would look if he didn't have
glasses on and he had sort of a
perpetual
smile
that no matter whether he was serious or
joking
he still had that same wry smile
so that when he talked
you sort of always knew he was kidding
no matter how serious he was
he was also kidding
i've never seen anybody who could take
something you know so non-seriously
while still completely doing his job you
know he didn't he was a good performer
and
one day he he went into his jargon
filled status update and the boss who i
don't know if he was completely in on
the joke or not i think he was because
he was he was pretty with it sort of
just sat there and
just he just lets him go and and red
would just go
well you know in this teamwork filled uh
synergy we've got to re-engineer all of
our processes
to make our systems run
so they're self-healing and he would
just go on
and
and you you would think you would think
that it couldn't go any further like
he'd used every jargon in the first 10
seconds and you're like okay that's the
funniest thing i've ever heard and that
that 10 seconds
just keeps going
and by about the second minute
of nothing but nonstop jargon you you're
reduced to a puddle you're just crying
like i lost so much moisture that day of
just like tears shooting out of my eyes
as he's going through his status report
it was just the most beautiful thing
anyway you had to be there
so i'm sorry i'm sorry i bored you with
that because you had to be there
all right but dave is back that's the
point of that
um
uh so is the russian economy going into
hell or or not so cnn says maybe it is
going to hell but there's smoke and
mirrors
so you can't tell
and the funniest story of the day where
again
i made a tweet and somebody couldn't
tell if i was kidding
so actually i wasn't planning this to
work so perfectly with what i just said
before
but
um there's a story about the some of the
crew from the late show was stephen
colbert
and i guess they were arrested by the
u.s capitol police in a congressional
office
where they weren't supposed to be so
they were there trying to do some kind
of a segment for the show
and i guess they didn't have the right
approvals and they got arrested
and so i tweeted
that to me that looks like an
insurrection
and somebody
pushed back
because they couldn't tell
if i were being serious
that's the parody reality crossover
that somebody couldn't tell if i was
being serious when i said that seven
people
filming a comedy show
without permission in a room
was an insurrection against the country
and somebody thought that i actually
believed that and i was arguing that and
then they push back
here we are
i turned into red and i wasn't even
trying
all right
uh
there's a gallup poll that says belief
in god is waning
so i wonder what you would say
how what percent of us adults do you
think believe in god if you haven't seen
the story don't cheat all right no
cheating
so if you haven't seen the latest poll
so you're just guessing i don't want the
real number here i'll tell you the real
number what percentage of
u.s adults say they believe in god
right now this year what percentage
i'm seeing 50s 60s 40s
20s
25
stop at 72 75
50 85 somebody says 80
so
how can it be that we live in the same
country
and there are people who are guessing
that 80
believe in god
and there are other people thinking 40
do we live in the same country
or maybe maybe it's people from other
countries who are voting
but
there's something wrong with that isn't
there
there's there's something wrong there
that there are people who are adults who
live in this country who think that
maybe 40 believe in god
and others think that 80 believe in god
which one do you think is true
the answer is 81
but that's actually at an all-time low
so that is uh
it's lowest in 78 years it's down six
points from 2017.
so from about the time that uh trump got
elected
uh belief in god went down six points
well
do you remember my most mind-blowing
uh
prediction
from 2015.
i predicted
that i think i was 2015 might have been
16. i predicted that trump's election
would change more than politics
it would change how we saw reality
itself
now when i said that like i didn't even
get retweets
because absolutely nobody knew what i
was talking about because you it just
didn't make sense back then
and then i i kept repeating it
so those of you have been following me
for a while
you can confirm
that every
x months or whatever i would just repeat
it
and say that trump trump was changing
more than politics he was changing how
we saw reality itself
and then
here we are
and we understand that fake news is
pervasive
it's not just on your on the other side
right it's on your side too
and the fake news is actually the news
that moves the dial
and real news
is actually often less important than
the fake stuff
that is a complete a complete change of
understanding of reality itself
you thought you lived in at least a
semi-believable credible reality and you
didn't
you didn't live in anything that was
credible
you lived in a total fake constructed
fake news reality
and it took the trump experience
to understand that
and now we do i mean the the world is
way more sophisticated in terms of
understanding what's real and what's
maybe not real than we were just a few
short years ago
so belief in god also is part of that
same story
if we're down six points
just during that brief sort of trump
period up till now
that is a fundamental change in how the
united states views
reality itself
the that that was probably the freakiest
prediction i've ever made but i was
quite sure when i made it and here we
are
all right here's something that i'm
going to put this in the category of
stories i don't believe are true
i want it to be true
and if it's true it's really going to be
cool
and it's really impressive
but it falls into a category of things
that everything that's been in that
category so far hasn't been true
for example one category would be
people who invented
nuclear fusion and it runs in their
garage
that's never been true
not one time
has anybody actually in their garage
invented nuclear fusion
so if you see something that's in the
category of something that's never been
true
you you should be a little bit you know
aware right
so what i'm going to tell you
to me seems so clearly not true
but maybe it is
maybe so we're going to pretend that
we're going to suspend our credibility
just so we can feel like it's true
and just see if it makes you feel good
right
there's a an israeli startup called
aquarius
that has built a new kind of car engine
that has one moving part
and it could use any kind of fuel
i mean hydrogen
gas
ethanol i guess that sort of thing so
that's the story it's actually being
reported
that has one moving part
and it can burn multiple kinds of gas
and you can get hundreds and hundreds of
miles
per gallon or no between fill ups i
guess so you could go like over 700
miles before needing a fill up because
it's way more efficient as well
now this is reported in the so-called
news
so you can you can see the retweet in my
twitter feed if you want to see it
now let me ask you
does this look even a little bit true
it doesn't look true to me
it doesn't even look slightly possibly
true
not even
not even worth considering true
but on the other hand
wouldn't be fun if it were
wouldn't it be fun
can can we hold both thoughts on our
head
i believe we could because
my livestream audience
not only are you the sexiest people in
the whole world
but you're the most sophisticated
thinkers
the most capable thinkers and we can
hold both of those thoughts at the same
time
let's do it
the odds of that being true
are really really low
only only because it's in the news
and
and just on the surface it's in the
category of things that are never true
right
am i right that it's in the category of
things that's never true
uses all those fuels
but you know i think it has more to do
with how the news is reporting
so you know maybe if you were to dig
into what works and what doesn't work
and whether there are any flaws in the
technology and what does it really mean
when they say they can burn any kind of
fuel does that mean hypothetically but
really there's only one kind you would
use in reality so it's really kind of
one fuel i mean if you dug in it would
probably be
look a little different
don't you think
so i'm going to say that at the very
least the reporting's probably
too simplified
too simplified that's my guess
but wouldn't it be it wouldn't be
awesome
what if it's true
wouldn't that be amazing
all right so just hold both those
thoughts you can do it
all right um
so
what about the uh story are you
following the story that when trump was
calling the january's
i guess after the election
when trump was saying the election was
rigged and he was
raising money based on that to
fight against the
election outcome i guess
and i guess they pulled in 250 million
dollars
and apparently
uh where it went
is a little sketchy
do you all know that story
so i'm interested how how much the news
bubble
is preventing
my live stream audience from even
knowing that that's a story
so
so some of you don't know that story
so tell me if you haven't heard it yet
because it's a pretty big story
yeah
um
now here's what you should always know
about these kinds of stories
the first thing you should know
is that it's in the category of stories
that probably you're going to find out
is different than the way it's being
reported now
do you think that's fair
that probably when we know more about
this story
it won't look exactly the way it was
first reported it could be worse
it could be it could be no
no jeopardy at all
could go either way
would you also agree
that there have been numerous
bs stories about trump and banks and
finances
they have all turned out to be s
and turns out they were nothingness
so it's in the category of things
that often
but not always turn out to be not real
but you could say trump university was
real
and that was sort of just just the way
it looked
whatever you thought about that it was
it was just what you thought it was
so this could turn out that way too
on the surface
it looks like
trump abused his donors
their emotional state
to raise a bunch of money that may or
may not have gone to things that are
good for trump or the trump businesses
or the trump family
so i would say we don't know that
we also don't know if any of it was
illegal
because what's interesting is i even
heard bill maher
say what you know he was wondering why
congress was not going to refer trump
to the department of justice for
anything they found out about this
january 6 business
to which i said
what did anybody suggest trump did that
was a crime
because i haven't heard anybody say
this is what we say is a crime and
here's the evidence of that crime have
you
or am i in such a bubble that i i've
missed the biggest story in the world
that they have actual evidence of trump
in a crime
i'm not aware of any
i'm not even aware of the allegation are
you
so if you're asking the question why
he's not being referred to the justice
department you're already thinking past
the sale
that that's a sign that propaganda
worked
if you're asking yourself why isn't he
being jailed
you've you've thought all right past the
question of
um was there any alleged crime
and you've not only thought past the
question of was there an alleged crime
to is there any evidence
any
i haven't seen any
i don't believe anybody's seen any have
they
now i think it's just like adam schiff
keeps saying oh yeah we got the goods
and blah blah blah but
you don't think you would have seen it
yet are they hiding the good stuff for
later
maybe
i mean that's perfectly possible they
might be keeping the good stuff for
later
we'll see i'm open to everything
all right
um
but i'm gonna watch that story that's a
scary one
so with given all the context of that
story and everything else here's the
best thing i can do for the
country convince trump
to fix the news
because the news is the
the tale that wags the dog of
politics the news has to get fixed
because until the news gets fixed
nothing's going to get fixed
and the way he can fix the news is the
way bill maher is trying to fix the news
but even
know more powerfully
i would say that bill maher is trying to
fix the news
meaning he sees a big disconnect between
what the news is saying and what people
are
you know understanding
and how that's just all broken
trump needs to fix it
and if he could fix the news
he would go down in history as not only
the most powerful
powerful person in the country more
powerful than the politicians
but he would have fixed our biggest
problem
because until you get a legitimate
you know a both sides news program
that's also interesting
and gets clicks
you don't have anything
let me tell you how trump could fix
everything
why is our why is the news cycle broken
such that
people want to click on fake news
instead of real news why do people like
fake news instead of real news why
why
it's more interesting
right now it agrees with them it gives
them a dopamine hit but it's also just
wildly more interesting
so i would click on something that
wasn't in my favor
like you know didn't support my point of
view i would definitely click on it if
it was really provocative
like i'll click on anything provocative
for the entertainment for the you know
just the wildness of it
now what is it that trump could do that
nobody's ever done with
straight unbiased reporting
think about it
the reason that nobody wants a straight
unbiased reporting is that nobody would
watch it
am i right
if you gave me just the news
nobody will watch it so it's not a
business model that can work
what is the one thing that trump
alone among maybe anybody
could fix
he could make you watch the news
and he could also make sure you heard
both sides
and he could also take his time
imagine if he took a
a rush limbaugh
three or four hour block every day
and had on experts from both sides
and then just dusted them both up
so basically
instead of experts instead of having
let's say one expert just give their
opinion which is the worst model in the
world that's how it's currently being
done it's mostly just one person says
one thing
or there's a time limit
and and the two experts say you're wrong
you're wrong we're out of time
so the public got nothing
but you give me a three or four hour
block it doesn't have to be every day
could be recorded and you know just when
there's a good topic to do and you have
trump
beating up both sides and calling
 on both sides
i could not turn away from that
that would be so provocative and
interesting especially if you allowed
swearing
if you allowed swearing and let trump
mediate and interrupt
and
you know and just sort of control it
so it would be maddeningly frustratingly
beautiful
it would be maddening and frustrating
and beautiful
he could do
trump could do with his
specific set of talents
including his talent stack
of once being president of the united
states
you add that with his you know natural
ability to provoke
his natural personality in the room
his
you know his desire to be in front of
the public his desire to make a
difference his desire to change things
it works for everything
the only way the republicans can lose
is if trump runs
now even if all the polls say trump
would win maybe he would
but is that really the victory that you
want
if you could have trump fixing the news
at the same time desantis
was making sure that the garbage gets
picked up
if you know what i mean
because a lot of the job of the
president is just being competent and
being present and having a lot of energy
and
making sure things don't fall between
the cracks and
as far as i can tell desantis
is really effective as an executive as a
leader
but imagine
there's not many fireworks i mean
maybe it's not going to be as much news
but imagine
trump
handling the opinion and news
cycle
now maybe
he could make that a uh here's here's
how i would do it if i were trump it's
looking like truth social is going to
have some issues right
it's not taking off the way you want it
but it could
all you would have to do
is have a trump tv show
like a let's say a foundational what
would you call it a magnet
business
and then have truth social the only way
that he interacts with the public
so it's a tv show and you know internet
property youtube would be everywhere
streaming maybe probably streaming
could be on a network but maybe
streaming
or both
and
do you love it yet
do you love the idea yet
because you can have everything
what you want is to fix the news
and what you want is to have a
republican
uh president if if i read my audience
right
right
so i'm not
i'm not endorsing desantis's policies
that's not what i do
but as a representative of his base
uh he's a good fit
it's just obviously true at this point
so why wouldn't you take the most
competent executive
and pair that with
the one person who can save us
obi-wan kenobi
trump trump is the only person who could
save the news business i mean it's so
ironic it's delicious is it not
remember when
elon musk tweeted
that reality
uh usually takes the path that's most
entertaining
to the observer not necessarily to the
people in the in the topic
the most entertaining path for the
observer observers that's us
our most entertaining path
would be for trump to save us
by not running for president
if he runs for president
we're going to fight more
are we not
but wouldn't you love to see trump host
a climate change debate
and actually see trump's own mind
getting changed in the process
i'm not saying it would or should
but how much would you love to watch
that
how much would you love
somebody
who was qualified and smart who had a
nice chunk of time like a whole joe
rogan three-hour block
wrestling with trump and with somebody
on the other side
until you actually watched trump
change his mind on a major topic right
in front of you
because he could
i mean trump would be able to pull that
off especially if it had entertainment
value
if it had entertainment value he could
pull it off
and michael schellenberger would be the
the type of guest
that would be perfect for that format
so all right so now you've heard the
idea
trump becomes the rush limbaugh
replacement but way better
because he's got people on and he's
fighting with him and he's you know
really
he's really getting
getting down to the good stuff
that opens the path for a moderate
republican
who could pretty much just walk in and
take over everything at this point
and it uh it basically gives you
everything
and then the news the legitimate news
would still be fighting with trump
but when when they're fighting with
trump it's like cnn versus fox news it's
not really hurting anybody just sort of
entertaining
all right
so you tell me
that's not the best thing for america go
and he and here's my argument for trump
i told you i would persuade trump
himself
all right here's the part where i
persuade trump himself
everybody in america thinks this would
be the best solution
some people might not like the part
about a moderate republican winning the
presidency
but everyone wants trump
to be productive
and not everyone thinks that the
presidency is how he's going to do it
the second term
this is the best idea you've ever heard
and he i think he would recognize it too
because it gives him not only a
a win
but one of the biggest wins of all time
and maybe in the most important topic
because remember the news is the tale
that wags the dog
if if he's the tail
if he becomes the tail he gets to wag
the dog
you know he he could control the
presidency no matter who's and who's in
the seat
you don't think that would be appealing
now the the only way to control it
is if the debates that were you know
that he hosted
produced something that was good you
know
but that would be
the most productive good
kind of control you could ever have
so just like
we liked jimmy carter better because
he was such a good ex-president
i would argue that trump was one of the
best presidents
for one term
and i would argue that he would be the
best
media news
host personality
i believe he he would
you know if he wants a final act
he's at that age where he's thinking
like what's my final act if he wants a
final act
completely dominating the industry that
he's been maligning the news industry
would be an excellent way to do it
you know he
trump criticized governments and then
became the head of it
he criticized the fake news business
he could become his king
the path is wide open he has all the
skills he has all the tools
and then you don't have to worry about
did trump do that bad thing that time
because you know what
you probably did
i don't know which bad thing you're
thinking about but when trump ran for
office he told us directly in his own
words
i'm no angel
i consider that transparent
i heard it and said oh okay you're no
angel so i'm gonna hear stuff about you
that i'm not going to like
but in return for that
you're going to provide a set of
services
that sound attractive
in my case i wanted him to break
everything
because i think everything needed to get
broken
so i wanted him to just change all of
our assumptions about everything and
that's what i mean by breaking it
changing all of our assumptions i think
he did that
so i got what i wanted
to me trump delivered
i'm no angel
but i'm gonna break all of these things
and make you think about them
differently that's what i was buying
that's what i got
i got a guy who's no angel
just like he said
i mean
that's the most accurate thing anybody
ever said
and i got somebody who shook everything
up
very much like the way i would walk
now i think he was too provocative
but
you know he has a chance now
to turn all of that
all of that energy that he created
he has a chance to monetize it first of
all that's always good and he has a
chance to turn it into the most positive
thing that's happened in this country in
100 years
and he could own that and he could just
you know be be the george washington who
walked away basically
you know one of the reasons that george
washington is always
so you know hero worshipped
and should be and and who knows how much
of this is true by the way
you know the story goes
and let's be a little more sophisticated
than just believing every historical
story but the story is that washington
walked away from what could have been a
dictatorship if he wanted to because he
had
the loyalty of the army and you know
blah blah
and so therefore he was the father of
the country because that standard of of
peacefully transferring power
became our standard
here's why i doubt that story
don't you think george washington might
have had his own reasons
that were not necessarily the same
reasons that he
may be said in public and got reported
maybe do you think that maybe he just
wanted to go back to his uh slave forum
and rape his slaves
i'm not saying that's what was going on
i'm saying that if you live in the real
world
this guy had been off fighting wars for
a long time
and he probably thought okay if i stay
in washington i'll probably get
assassinated
uh you know i'm not around all the
you know my own
plantation and stuff
i think i'd rather just go back to my
plantation and
be the be the evil king and
do anything i want with my slaves no
matter how
horrible that sounds
maybe
maybe i mean it's possible that the
historical story is exactly right he was
the most awesome of people very
different from the people of his times
in some ways and knew that the standards
walking away would become
you know the dna of our republic forever
maybe
maybe
but could you imagine that happening
today
it's kind of hard to imagine
and i think
did people become shitty just since
since then
you know were there
truly awesome
unselfish people back then and george
washington was one of them
or
is our history as fake as our news
which is more likely
is it more likely that washington was
just as awesome as you've been told
or is it more likely that history is
just as fake as our news
it's a lot more likely
that nothing about washington is exactly
true
the most likely
you know reality
is that
you know
he didn't chop down a cherry tree and
you know there's things about him that
we know are made up
so i'm pretty sure it's all made up
meaning that there's always context left
out
that's right
so
there i have now just saved the country
all it will take is for this coherent
argument
to gain ground with
trump supporters
and then for those trump supporters to
get that message to trump himself
and uh then if he creates some kind of a
platform
to go there and support it
if it's a good one i mean it has to be a
good product but if it's a good product
and i believe he could create such a
thing
um
this with the george washington craft
am i trying to provoke you with the
george washington club i'm not trying to
provoke you over george washington
who exactly would get worked up over
george washington
is there somebody here is going to get
mad at me but because of my
my george washington opinions
i i think maybe we were a little
too serious about politics
no
damn is wooden teeth no
no let it go
he's been gone for a while
all right
you know i think even though i woke up
and today was
you know a slow news day
i think you would agree that i delivered
by doing the most important thing that
needed to be done
talking trump
into creating a media product to fix the
fake news
now
they say one person
can make a difference
but clearly
clearly one can
now i don't know if i will
will says it boredom
sorry
we bored that one guy
you know you shouldn't be listening to
me for the excitement
you should be listening to me because
the sound of my voice is so
calming
and for some exciting
some of you are stimulated
some of you are
stimulated in different ways
but in every case your minds are blown
and so on that note i'm gonna turn off
the uh
you have a bad voice somebody says uh
i'm gonna turn off uh youtube
and uh i'm gonna focus on my beloved
locals and i'll see you at youtube
