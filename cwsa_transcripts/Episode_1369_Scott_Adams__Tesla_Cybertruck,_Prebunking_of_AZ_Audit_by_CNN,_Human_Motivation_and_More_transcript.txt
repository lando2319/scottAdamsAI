hey everybody
come on in it's time for coffee with
scott adams
best part of your day have you noticed
that everything up until now seemed a
little dull
and interesting but now the simultaneous
sip
is about to happen and suddenly every
part of your body is on it's alive it's
alive
and if you'd like to enjoy this moment
to its optimal sense
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker chelsea steiner canteen dragon
flashcard vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better you know you need it
it's called the simultaneous sip
and the luckiest people in the world are
about to enjoy it
now go
good morning patrick from new york city
it's good to have you here
well did you ever have one of those days
where you wish
that a part of a chinese rocket
that is currently in our atmosphere
or outside the atmosphere circling the
earth
and apparently big parts of this chinese
rocket are going to fall to earth and i
was thinking this morning
god wouldn't it be great if one of those
fell on me and killed me
and i'm thinking that's probably not a
healthy thought
but i was thinking of all the ways that
you have to go
you know i'm at that age where i started
thinking a little bit more and more
about my end date
you know my expiration date you know the
older you get
the more you think you know that could
be any day now
i was thinking to myself of all the ways
that i could die
my number one first choice would be to
be killed
by a falling chinese rocket
number one you wouldn't know it was
happening
you would just be walking you know
having your day
boom and you're gone that's how i want
to go
i don't want to see it coming i don't
want to have a warning
i just want to be doo
gone he said i've had a good run
i'd be ready and you don't want your
death to be wasted right don't wouldn't
you like to think
well maybe you had a little meaning can
you imagine what would happen
if i got killed by a chinese rocket i
mean
of all the people that could be killed
by a chinese rocket
i mean it would be more impactful if it
were someone more famous
but i'm kind of an anti-china guy you
know pretty pretty dedicated to the
anti-china
world and uh if i got if i got killed by
a falling chinese rocket
it'd probably be good for the world so
bring it on bring on that rocket
speaking of cool things
elon musk the best marketer of all time
via the process of not doing any
marketing
can somebody fact check me on this i
believe tesla doesn't do advertising
right
but you know in a sense they do
marketing because i guess there's
uh the new cyber truck the tesla cyber
truck
has been seen driving around uh times
square
and tonight elon musk will be on snl
can you think of a better marketing
campaign
than hosting snl and having your cool
cyber truck driving around and it's
already trending on
twitter so really good
morning um something happened with
twitter recently didn't it
has anybody noticed that twitter stopped
showing you
political tweets from people that you
followed
now i don't know if it's happening to
everybody but
um what looks like what's happening is
that people like me
who are not so bad that i could easily
be canceled
you know i i kind of walk right up to
the edge of of things that could get you
canceled
but as far as i know i've never crossed
the line
have you ever seen me cross the line
into something that you could
unambiguously say oh that's a
violation of terms of service i don't
think so because i try pretty hard not
to do it
and i don't think it's hard right is it
hard
to not be banned it's not hard
the the things which get you banned are
kind of obvious
right most of the time but if you can't
get somebody like me and shut me up the
next best thing is to just turn off my
twitter feed and it looks like that
happened
meaning that i'm still on twitter but
can you imagine that i just don't even
see the tweets of the people i've
interacted with
and tweeted and followed the most
so like in the last several days i
haven't seen anything from
i think the last 24 hours nothing from
jack bosobic
who i would normally see a whole bunch
of times a day
nothing from mike cernovich who i would
normally see lots of times today
now is it a coincidence that the first
day i
it's just really noticeable because i
would see normally see so much
cernovich activity that just went to
zero
the day after he was on a poll
without running for governor of
california he's he's polling at three
percent
he's not in the race and he didn't know
he would be part of the survey
or the poll and suddenly breitbart is
interviewing him and saying
are you serious about this and he says
yes
he's serious about thinking about it now
and
he the way he framed it was that at
least to push some
you know push some ideas forward that
wouldn't get pushed otherwise
and i'm thinking to myself i can't even
imagine what would be more fun
than a governor cernovich i mean really
i just i can't even imagine anything
more fun than that or more useful
you know or better for the state i mean
it would just be
a wild wild you know show
the media people would go nuts they
would just lose their
and i would like to see that so much
so i hope he runs uh well you know for
his own benefit uh
i don't know if it's good for him so i
can't say it'd be good for him or his
family
but i would say that i would entertain
the hell out of me and i would be all in
if he runs
so i feel that i have been
algorithmically castrated
that should be a thing algorithmically
castrated
so if you can't be banned outright they
can just remove all your connections
so my twitter growth basically just
stopped
it just stopped at the same time my
twitter
my youtube traffic is growing
do you think it's likely that my youtube
traffic would be growing
nicely but my twitter followers would
just flatline
at exactly the same time does that sound
like something that
that could happen naturally well i
suppose it could
it's possible but it doesn't look like
it doesn't feel like it
so um i don't know if this is happening
to any of you
but it looks to me as though um
twitter is just dialing me down a little
bit
and i don't know if there's any way to
even know is there
there's no way to check right you can't
ask them
who would you talk to that's the scary
part the scariest part about
the algorithms and the social media
platforms is there's nobody you can talk
to
you can complain but there's nobody to
talk to
right
once again i've told you to look for
this pattern
it's a very consistent pattern and it is
how
somebody like a mike cernovich could
become governor or
president easily
right just by knowing the thing i'm
going to tell you next
which is that democrats ignore human
motivation
when they design systems and
republicans don't so if you're looking
for a way to make
democrats and republicans you know come
together in some kind of policy way
this would be the way you just take the
politics out of it and say
this is all i care about things that
motivate people correctly
and things that don't motivate people
correctly
you can talk about politics all you want
you can talk about your democrats and
your
your liberals and your all that i'm not
interested
this is how you would win and this is
something that only somebody as smart as
a cernovich and i mean smart as in terms
of not just iq
but having the right talent stack to to
understand
you know that you could penetrate it
it's a it's a very thin membrane
that seems like it's thick the thin mem
the the membrane being
that you can't crack politics to get any
message through to the other side
you know democrats can't really reach
republicans republicans can't reach
democrats
certain good right it's just a
skill thing
he has the skill he can do it
name one other person really seriously
one other person
who could do that he's probably the only
person i know
who has the right skill set so and the
balls to do it right you'd have to have
gigantic balls
as well as the skill set and that just
limits the number of people who would do
it
so that could be interesting and here's
the other example of democrats
ignoring human motivation the the jobs
report
turned out to be disappointing because
it turns out
big surprise that if you pay people more
to not work
then you pay them to work what will they
do
anybody anybody what will happen when
you pay people more
to not work than to work
use your great analytical minds
to predict what could go wrong
what would be an outcome of that oh
unemployment right now i told you
yesterday that
if you one way to know you're in the
golden age
is if your problems look like this
because there's no world in which there
are no problems right that's not really
an option
but when your problem is that people are
making more money not working than
working
and it looks like that'll be temporary
you've got a pretty solvable problem
there
i guess uh ron desantis decided to solve
it
so he's going to be you know cutting
back on some of these
payments to try to you know nudge people
into taking
some of the many open jobs because
there's plenty of jobs
it's a weird situation plenty of jobs at
the same time
plenty of unemployment and i thought
yesterday must be a training issue
but it's also an incentive issue
all right um bill and melinda gates
so this story that won't die
and um
so there's a so
i don't know i probably shouldn't get
into this but i'm going to
you know because it's a personal issue
it's not really politics
but i can't resist it also the news is
so boring
i mean i've got biden boring syndrome
oh my biden is just boring the hell out
of me and it's starting to affect my
mental health
because i'm getting too bored uh but
anyway the bill melinda gates story is
interesting because
apparently it sounds like they waited
until their youngest was
18 so probably they had some problems
for a while
but she wrote
how come this didn't come through
i must be missing a page of my notes but
i believe that
melinda gates has said something along
the lines of
that she was an equal partner with bill
and she wanted everybody to know that
she wasn't just a stay-at-home mom
which apparently she'd been at some
point that she was an equal partner
with bill gates to which i say you know
it's none of my business because i'm not
married to either one of them
but i feel as like i i see the problem
do you see the problem is it just me
so melinda gates says that she wants to
be an equal partner
like in decision making and running the
probably running the
the non-profit etc do you see the
problem yet
one of them is one of the smartest
people in the world
one of them created microsoft
from nothing
the other one is melinda gates
now melinda gates is a pretty serious
person right if you
were to compare her to the average human
being
she would be high functioning you know
successful on
every level but what if you compare her
to bill gates
and i wonder einstein was married right
am i right about einstein was married to
i know a cousin or something
don't you imagine that einstein's wife
would have arguments with uh literally
einstein
in which you would say look you know i'm
pretty sure you're wrong about this
and then einstein would say
i don't want to be a jerk about this
but i'm einstein
and you're somebody i'm having sex with
happened to be my cousin that's a
different story
but you get the difference right i'm
einstein and you're
whatever is not that
you're like somebody who married
einstein
so when we're having an argument and we
disagree about what is true or right or
logical
i'm feeling you should just go with my
opinion
because i'm einstein
i think we should be done here did i
mention
i'm einstein if you're tuning in late
i'm not einstein
that was a skit so
i have a feeling it would be really hard
to be bill gates
and try to pretend that melinda was his
intellectual equal
because she isn't not even close
they're they're not even in the same
ballpark and i feel sorry because how is
he going to find somebody who is really
and which probably has a lot to do with
why he was
apparently they had some arrangement in
which he could see his ex-girlfriend for
a weekend
or something a month or a per year
and one imagines that that was a source
of tension because i think
that he liked his prior girlfriend
because of her intellectual capacity
so yes i know
einstein married his cousin so she was
probably also named einstein
is that what you're telling me because i
was thinking about that when i told
the story and like damn it i hope the
cousin's name wasn't einstein because
that's ruining my whole skit
all right well um
i'm sure that uh i'm sure that the cases
will be fine
all right uh why are my notes in no
particular order
something going on here oh
my printer printed on the back that's
not
that's just wrong all right so
here's a question for you in the
beginning of the pandemic
we were all dumb including the experts
not for any bad reason but it was a
novel
virus right so nobody really understood
the coronavirus
and so i give everybody a pass
for anything they said that was wrong be
they experts or not because we were
we were all kind of guessing in the
beginning
now imagine if you will
that the coronavirus were to hit today
and had never hit before
but we had all the knowledge that we
have today let's say we don't have any
vaccines yet
but we just have the understanding of
the virus
how much better would we have done
because it seems to me that we've
we meaning science is starting to land
on the following proposition
that the chance of getting coronavirus
if you stay six feet away from people
forget about masks if you stay six feet
away from people
and um and you don't stay in a closed
area for more than 15 minutes
but let's let's uh lower that to
five minutes or six minutes
because that's safer so you need about
15 minutes
inside a closed space in which case that
six feet wouldn't help you at all
so let me see if i can say this clear if
you're outdoors
six feet is all you need but if you're
indoors
six feet won't help you if you stay
there too long
so there are two variables how long you
stay there if it's indoors
and how close you are and i was
wondering if you could
you come up with a like clever slogan
that would make this easy which is
six feet or six seconds something like
that
now the six seconds would be just an
arbitrary short period of time
designated to tell you that you can be
within six feet of somebody
and you can be in a room with them but
just make you brief
so i've been sort of monitoring my own
activities and
you know social distancing etc and i'm
finding that
it's really easy to stay six feet away
from people
as long as you don't have to be absolute
about it
you know if if you're sometimes getting
within six feet and then you know out
no problem we know that now right just
somebody being near you
isn't enough that you have to have some
concentrated
you know you've really got to be
marinating in the room before you get it
so we know we don't get it from surfaces
much or at least enough to worry about
at this point
and we know that's the super spreaders
and we know what they look like
because the people who are going to get
the worst case of the
the disease are going to be the ones who
are the most super spready
in general could be exceptions but
imagine if we started with our current
knowledge
so just imagine on day one we said
here's the deal
six feet outdoors boom forget about
masks
because i don't even know if you need
them outdoors if you're indoors well use
a mask if you're going to be within six
feet for more than
or even just indoors for more than six
seconds or something
now the six seconds might maybe make
that six minutes or something but
the point is probably we could have
simplified this to the point
where the only thing we had to do is
stay six feet away
or don't stay in the room too long and
then maybe we'd be done it could that
could be the whole thing
i wonder if that'd be enough
um axios is reporting
that the uk is going to launch a study
to see if if they do these cheap
daily covet tests uh plus of course they
have vaccinations
if that's enough to really make a
difference in the
slowing the spread and of course i've
been talking about this
since uh nine months ago maybe
michael mina is the one who i think is
the most
um the most useful vocal proponent of
this method
and he's been talking about it that's
where i heard it first um
why is it taking so long yeah yeah i'm
watching in the in the comments somebody
says a bit late
why did it take so long i feel like the
only reason we're allowed to do this
the uk or or anybody is there must be
some big corporate entity
that decided it doesn't matter now but i
feel like somebody was just stopping it
i just don't know who because it made
sense from day one
the math made sense the logic made sense
and nobody ever disagreed
that's the weird thing about it in most
issues you've got some disagreement
but with this rapid testing thing nobody
who
understood it disagreed with it
that i'm aware of there were lots of
people who misunderstood it to be a
little different than what it really was
and they they were disagreeing with the
misunderstanding but nobody who
understood it
expert or non-expert nobody who
understood it
disagreed with it and it took nine
months before they
even put a trial together there's
something deeply mysterious about why
this didn't happen sooner because it was
just so obvious
i don't know maybe it's a communication
thing
um but that's good news anyway
here's uh the news that may get me
kicked off of all social media we'll see
let's see how close we can fly to the
sun you ready
if this is the last time you ever see me
it's been nice
so i saw a bunch of social media stories
that
there was violence in israel there were
some kind of
protests palestinian protests in some
holy area
story you've heard a million times
the israeli military or whoever the air
forces
responded and people got hurt and i
think there were some deaths
so the story sounds like you know
groundhog day
there's more protests blah blah people
got hurt
blah blah and so i said to myself wow
what are they protesting
it wasn't in the story or the headline
and i thought well isn't that like the
main story
it's like why are you protesting
and then what happened in the protest
how do you leave after why are you
protesting
check today the major media the way
they're tweeting and talking about it
i'm not sure that they're really even
covering the reason
so i had to go to follow the hashtag on
twitter
and find some anti-israel people
just to find out what the context was
just the context that's it i had to go
to
anti-israel sources
and the protest is allegedly and you
know given the quality of the reporting
and where i'm getting it from i don't
even know if this is true
but allegedly there's some kind of
ethnic cleansing going on over there
in jerusalem in which uh people who are
not
not jewish or is it not israeli citizens
i'm not sure which it is um are being
forcibly relocated
to which i say is that true
and you know i saw somebody on twitter
push back and say uh well you don't
understand
you know that's how it is over there
basically to which i say i'm not even
i'm not even arguing the point
what i'm i'm only amazed that i couldn't
get at the context from our regular
news the regular news just didn't even
put the context in there
i would think ethnic cleansing should
have been the headline
now i'm going to say a legend
because i'm sure if he asks israel they
wouldn't say they're doing any ethnic
cleansing would they
so whatever they think they're doing
it's probably a security thing
or i don't know who knows what it is i'm
sure they have a good reason
or at least it would sound good if you
heard it but why is that not the
headline
people protesting ethnic cleansing
well you can you can
answer that question yourself
over on cnn it looks like chris seliza's
job is to pre-bunk the arizona audit
meaning to put enough doubt into the
people
doing the arizona election audit that no
matter what they come up with you're
going to say to yourself
well that was already pre-bunked
we don't even need to wait for the
outcome because we already know it's not
credible
and so they're going pretty hard at it
and except that
um here's the way they handled it this
is a crystal is a opinion piece on cnn
it says the headline says the most
absurd conspiracy theory yet
in the ongoing arizona recount now what
would you think
with this headline the most absurd
conspiracy theory yet
well the first thing you'd hear is there
are lots of conspiracy theories
so so if you're wondering if the arizona
audit
is being uh reported as maybe credible
or not credible
cnn's decided to paint them with the
multiple conspiracy theory brush
so right away they're they're they're
mired in multiple
conspiracy theories okay
um and then this one whatever they're
going to talk about next is the most
absurd one yet
so wouldn't you think that the story is
about the people doing the audit
believing conspiracy theories
right that's what the headline suggests
that the people doing the audit believe
that
in these conspiracy theories and then
they quote one of the persons who's
you know organizing it somebody in
charge and he says why are you
and the specifics was they're looking to
see if there's any bamboo fiber
in any of the ballots because if there
is that would suggest that the paper was
made in china
because we don't use bamboo as any part
of our paper products
okay now how likely is it
that they're going to find it bamboo in
the paper of the ballots
well i'm going to say unlikely
anything's possible i'm not going to
rule it out
but i would say that one's in the
unlikely category
however how did the person running the
audit who was interviewed
say he said that they were quote trying
to un-gaslight people about chinese
paper on ballots
i'm paraphrasing but he actually said on
gaslight
in other words the person running the
audit
doesn't believe there's going to be any
bamboo in the paper
but it would be helpful to get rid of
this conspiracy theory
in other words cnn was on the same side
as the guy they interviewed and then
wrote a headline to make it look like he
was on the opposite side
neither of them think that this is going
to come out with anything true
but both of them would like to see it
debunked
this guy's doing it he's actually
debunking it
by looking for it and not finding it
so this is just completely unethical
reporting or at least the headline is
unethical
but we've come to expect that so the
pre-bunking is underway
it does indicate that there is some fear
the the way they're saying it the cnn
folks are saying
the fear is that um that the
audit will come up with new bs that
everybody will have to explain away and
it's just
a lot of work or not but i think they
might be afraid that something might be
found as well they might be we can't
read their minds but
they might be all right
um
there we go there was all the missing
pages
so how important would it be to society
to have a credible source of news or
a credible source of fact checking
don't you think society would be greatly
benefited
by credible fact checking
well here's an example politifact
damn it never print on two sides
um so politifact is
uh jesus christ
sorry forget it
um i have a flaw in my mental makeup
which is that uh if things are
unorganized they drive me crazy
and my printer decided to print on the
back of one of my
sheets but not the rest it's making me a
little bit crazy
because you think your printer would
either print front and back
or print only front you don't expect
your printer to print three pages
but one of them has something on the
back now i don't think that's even the
setting
and the odds of that printer going over
my balcony to be
smashed into pieces after i'm done with
this broadcast are very high right now
here's another fake news uh from cnn so
the headline was school district
apologizes oh no actually this was on
twitter
various headlines so the school district
apologizes for offering
support circles to white students
following the chauvin trial
all right so there's a school district
look at
watch how misleading this is there's a
school district
that allegedly but it's not true
allegedly
offered support circles to white
students following the chauvin trial
so the first thing you need to know is
that it didn't happen all right so that
didn't happen
what it was was that white students were
invited
to become allies with people of color
and to basically you know just be
allied so it wasn't anything about
comforting white students
however people who thought that's what
it was about and it wasn't
protested so they had to walk it back
do you see how crazy this is so the head
so the thing they said
was something that wasn't happening it
was actually a completely
woke thing to do but because the
headline or the way it was presented
made it
look like it was unwoke they had to walk
it back
even though it was woke so you can't
even do a woke
thing if you explain it in a way that
other people criticize it as being
unwoke you have to you have to pull back
your wokeness
i mean that is we're in pretty absurd
territory
but here's the part that bothered me
why can't white students have a support
circle
after the chauvin verdict because i'm
pretty sure a lot of
white people believe that chauvin was
not the subject of justice because he
wasn't
i mean whatever that trial was and
whether or not chovin did something that
makes him go to jail or should make him
go to jail
it's a separate question but the trial
was unfair
if you're a white person and you watched
a white person be railroaded
in public by your justice system maybe
you do do the support group
maybe you should have a white person
support group you just watched a white
person being taken down by a political
by a political politically motivated
jury
you know even even if chauvin deserves
to be punished is a whole separate
question
but the trial wasn't fair i mean not
even a little bit
so anyway that bothers me on every level
of that story
and
all right i've got some other things to
talk about but they're too boring
all right um are any of you having uh
biden boredom
problems because there's something going
on
and i don't know if it's the golden age
that i didn't know the golden age would
be so boring
but i feel as if the news has just
stopped reporting
bad news because biden's in charge and
there isn't enough going on in the trump
world they're
they're doing like you know repeats and
stuff it's like oh remember the time
trump did this or remember the time he
said that
there's just nothing happened
boring but radical yeah that's a good
strategy that the democrats have
the more boring they make it the more
they can
slip through their radical agenda
but have you noticed that there's a
whole bunch of states
that are passing school choice
now or at least letting the money follow
the student which
turns out to be similar so there's some
really good things happening in the
world right now
but uh yeah so apparently uh matt gates
and
marjorie taylor green have teamed up for
some kind of a
tour and uh i think it's interesting
that the two most
canceled people decided to team up
i like the fact that neither of them
went on defense
they both went on offense and they
teamed together an offense it's a better
strategy
because if they apologize then it'd just
be over
but if they go on offense they have a
chance to make a dent
especially if they're interesting
all right um
many conservative women are emerging for
the gop somebody said
i don't know what that means weren't
they always there
somebody said i'm not going to read that
comment
that's funny all right
um
studies show that politicians who
apologize face more criticisms
yeah you would expect that wouldn't you
tim burns says how do you use your hands
in persuading
that's a good question i'll i'll answer
that question because i'm
uh i'm out of political stuff so
you could certainly be persuasive
without using your hands
it's not a requirement but if you're
trying to keep people's attention
your hands can really do it here's how i
do it
i do practically meaning my not meaning
miming have you ever seen me mime
here i am walking up to a glass wall
see pretty impressive anyway the point
is that i try to draw
physical objects with my hands if you
haven't seen me do that
so if i'm disc describing something that
there's a big thing in a small thing
you'll often see see me do with my hands
forming the big thing and then
separately talk about the
the small thing and part of that is to
make visual
what i'm talking about and because it's
movement movement
and it's big see how big this movement
is
if you looked at 100 people on stage how
many of them would have their hands up
here
not many this is really big and one of
the things you have to learn when you're
a presenter
is how to go bigger than you feel
comfortable with
if you're talking to a pup to the public
your
your natural inclination is to go small
with your hands you'd be like um you
know
sort of this thing um you know and uh
you know hope everybody's
you know feeling good a little bit
because you're gonna you're gonna have
an
illusion that the audience would think
you look funny
if you go bigger but in fact it's the
opposite
so once you get past the illusion then
you can really you know make a
difference on stage or in public
so the illusion is if i were to go like
this
you would like me less or respect me
less because i'm so wacky and i'm going
big
but it's actually the only reason
anybody wants to watch if you don't
if you don't exceed some expectations
nobody's going to be interested so you
have to either be more dangerous than
they thought you would be
see what i'm doing with my hands more
dangerous on this
it's almost physical you can see my
almost grabbing something
and moving it so more dangerous so i get
a little ball of danger in my hand right
now
so if you're not dangerous nobody cares
that's why trump is so interesting
that's why cernovich is so interesting
he's dangerous
it's why you watch me because i'm
dangerous
right so part of being dangerous is also
doing things that other people say
i couldn't do that because i would be
too embarrassed
so when you watch somebody who's doing
something that you couldn't do or
wouldn't do because you would be
embarrassed to do it
they're doing exactly the right thing
for a public presentation
so go big big this is big this is big
this is small
that's small go big all right
you'll never regret it
uh when you see a deaf person do this
he's done with you
okay we learned a little sign language
there some signing
how could i be embarrassed when so many
are so foolish
i like that point of view you know if
you can learn to not be embarrassed
by you know fear of failure and anything
else
it's like a superpower
all right uh show's age
what shows age hands i mean they do but
i don't know if that's your
point christine says
cernovich is repulsive you know that's
why he is
also uh successful if you didn't have
strong feelings for him both
positive and negative he wouldn't be who
he is
so there's nobody who evokes strong
positive feelings who doesn't evoke
strong negative ones i doubt you'd find
many exceptions
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
