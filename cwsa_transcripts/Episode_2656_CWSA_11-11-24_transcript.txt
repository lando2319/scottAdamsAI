wow just thought I'd check the stock
market before I got on
here it would appear
that Tesla's up 7 and a
half and bitcoin's
up good things happening today but we
got a show to
do it's going to be amazing amazing
really let me get my locals comments up
here perfect it's all working
today it's all working
[Music]
perfectly good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization this is probably the best
day you'll ever have in your life but if
you'd like to take it up two levels that
nobody can even understand with their
tiny shiny human brains all you need is
a CER marker glass a tanker chel or St a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
go
Ah that's some good stuff right there
are you ready for this number
one uh do we say happy Veterans Day do I
guess we say happy right so let's uh
take a moment to show some respect to
all of our veterans of various Wars and
whatnot it's your day today but still
some people have to go to work and thank
luckily for
you I do not take holidays off so here I
am as always well stock market's hitting
some record highs Bitcoin was up to
82,000 um last I checked Tesla stock is
screaming Trump media stock is doing
great and uh Paul Krugman predicts
economic
Doom Paul Krugman
Paul Krugman is pretty sure that Trump's
going to destroy the economy because
when you want to know what's going to
happen in the
future you go to Paul Krugman now Paul
Krugman is kind of famous for having bad
takes on economics despite having a
Nobel Prize in it so I wouldn't worry
about the economy as long as Paul
Krugman thinks it's a economic
Doom did you know that the University of
British Columbia is reporting that they
figured out how a small device could
turn CO2 into valuable
Fuel and all you would need is a
temperature
differential so how cool is this if you
have a temperature differential then you
can create energy so that's what a
Sterling engine is it's where you've got
a big difference between let's say uh an
ocean would be a certain temperature and
maybe the land would be heated by the
Sun it' be 50 degrees hotter or
something so if you have a big
difference in temperature you can make
enough
electricity that you can convert CO2
into Fuel and you could even do it on
the moon or not the moon but maybe Mars
so there might be a
way to use sunlight to produce fuel on
Mars how cool is
that I don't know it to me it just seems
really cool every time we come up with a
new way to make Mars practical
so I guess we'll be turning CO2 into
Fuel and who knows what else today we're
waiting for unless it's already happened
I haven't heard it but judge Maran is
going to rule on the immunity question
and whether or not there's going to be a
trial and whether to cancel it
and I feel like it's going to be good
news for Trump but I don't know the
legal system seems to be a little bit
corrupt so I don't know we'll wait for
that
um I love watching the news find out
that Trump was right about something
that they called fake news so at one
point Trump was claiming during the
recent hurricane that Republicans were
not getting the same amount of resources
as Democrats because Fimo being run by
the government has more Democrats in it
right now and of course he was he was
widely
debunked and uh turns out
that somebody got fired because they
were in fact in writing telling people
not to knock on the doors of uh people
who had Trump signs in their lawn so
Trump was right I don't know if he was
right about the scale of it but he was
right that resources were being
allocated based on political preference
that was actually true and I was
watching a little clip of all the people
who are calling him crazy for claiming
that one of them was Abby Phillip on uh
CNN and Abby Phillip first came to my
attention for pushing the fine people
hoax and since then she's been promoted
of course if you if you push fake news
you get promoted and uh now she's got a
regular show
and she seems to be the one most
protecting the obvious
hoaxes and honestly she looks like she
believes
them so when when I see her saying oh
that's a fake story and that's a
hoax she's wrong A lot of times but she
actually looks like she believes what
she's saying so I don't know what's up
with that so I don't know how you could
believe the finding people Oaks if
you're were in the news business but she
she seems very dedicated to believing
all the
hoaxes um there's a a report titled
Equity everywhere some group called Do
no harm
looked at the Dei policies of the uh
Government Federal Government and found
out there's just a ton of them they're
more than 80 Federal entities with some
kind of Dei in and uh the idea here is
that Trump's going to rip the Dei out of
the
government um which I'm pretty sure
he'll do but the reason he would do it
is because it's illegal it should be
illegal to have racial preferences and
hiring or anything else but it's all
over in the government and corporate in
the corporate world so here's what I'm
really wondering about several big
companies have paired back their Dei
efforts uh mostly from pressure from the
public but what happens when the
government makes it illegal to do it in
the government I've asked this before
but I think this might be a big
deal because you if you're like me you
think this Dei stuff can never be
removed it's like it just sort of became
like a stain on the on the on the
country and it'll just sort of always be
there but there is a possibility that if
you make it illegal in the government
it's going to be really hard for a
corporation to do it because how do you
defend something that your government
says no this is illegal this is uh
racial discrimination so stop doing it
are they going to keep doing it for a
while yes they
but it makes me wonder if there any
lawsuits or anything that would be more
easily won if the government has
declared it
illegal seems like that would help we'll
see um there was a uh some fake news on
the uh
internet uh it showed a screen image
that looked like a trump post saying
that he offered amnesty to hot
women uh and that he he offered amnesty
to hot Latinos and Eastern European
women will be granted amnesty everyone
else has to go
back everyone else has to go back and
people believed that that was true that
he was going to Grant amnesty to hot
women and send everyone else
back now I'm not opposed to the idea I'm
just telling you it's not true you know
if we wanted to talk about the Merit of
the idea well that's another
conversation
entirely um I saw a report that uh Trump
and the GOP are aiming for a shock and
awe start to their Administration in
other words to make sure that on day one
they're doing some big successful things
now what do I call that I have a name
for that I call it the new CEO move and
Trump did it the first time he got
elected as well um and what it is is
really important that your first
impression on a job sort of becomes the
permanent impression so whatever you're
doing in the first week or so if it's a
big failure then you're going to look
like the big failure Administration but
if your first week is full of
winds then it looks like whoa the winds
up their back he's a legend everything
he touches turns to Gold you better make
a deal with them and it can really make
a difference not just in the popularity
of the party but and how much they can
get done because if you become the
person who's solving problem after
problem and then you show up to
negotiate the end of some War here or
there it's going to be different oh this
is the person who solves every problem
okay I guess our war is
over so yes it does look like Trump is
gearing up to make big big moves really
fast and and it should be a lot of crowd
Pleasers you know closing the board
order crowd pleaser ending the war in
Ukraine crowd pleaser um there's a lot
of good things he can do right away
ending Dei at least to be a crowd
pleaser for
me here's a question that will uh plague
me one of my wrong predictions the
wrongest that it could be wrong was that
there would be so many claims of
election Integrity
cheating that we wouldn't know who was
president because we'd have to work
through all the claims
but it turns out there were
hardly and now we are left to wonder
why is it because Trump won so everybody
who would have complained just said hey
I I think I'll just be quiet about this
we got what we wanted I don't think so
because we didn't know he'd win when the
election was happening so if there had
been claims they still would have
stacked
up and apparently there are number of
you know anecdotally a number of stories
where the uh The
Observers stopped something from
happening that would have turned into a
claim if they had been able to let's say
um move The Observers out of the room or
something like that but they
weren't so I guess we'll never know or
maybe in some future election we'll know
if it was the um existence of The
Observers plus the very clear and Loud
threats from from the Republicans that
if you mess with this election you're
going to jail was that
enough was that enough to just stop the
cheating and then the other question
is um maybe the cheating would only be
in you know one Precinct you have to
worry about Maricopa all the time what
if it just happened in one place the
current projection is that Carrie lake
is behind and doesn't have won't be able
to catch up in the counting so she might
lose in Maricopa but people have some
questions why is it taking so long in
Maricopa why doesn't the why doesn't the
result look like what you'd expect it to
look like I'd expect if Trump won in
Arizona that Carrie Lake would win as
Senator but what if Trump wins and Cary
Lake doesn't win well then you can have
a question now that doesn't mean that's
impossible there's there's plenty of
precedent for you know split ticket kind
of stuff but uh it would raise a
question like maybe we need to explain
this because in my view she seems like a
very strong candidate if you could just
look at the candidate and say oh that
guyo guy you know he's really got it in
you know he's got the goods but I don't
think that's the
case so there are
questions it would be wonderful to find
out that even Maricopa was completely
Coptic everything
worked um there's there's a uh I just
saw it in the comments there's a meme
going around showing that uh all of the
states that Trump won require ID to vote
and all of the states he lost don't
require ID to
vote the implication being that all of
those States cheated and they had you
know non-voters voting people who uh
didn't have ID and and uh I would say
that you cannot conclude that all right
so the results do not suggest that what
the results do suggest is that blue
states don't require ID and red states
do so Trump wins the red states he
doesn't win the blue States it doesn't
mean anything about ID it doesn't mean
they
cheated it would look that it would look
exactly the same if there was massive
cheating or no massive cheating Trump
would still win the red States and he'd
still lose the blue states with without
cheating unless it was you know
something something really weird
happening anyway so I'm willing to I'm
willing to accept the possibility that I
was 100% wrong and that there would not
be massive cheating in the
election I just don't know
why is it because it was never going to
happen was there never any cheating in
prior
years or would this be the one year that
the cheaters say we better take this one
off is it possible you got a cheaters
holiday meaning that maybe they always
cheat and have since I've been born but
this was the one time they said you know
we're either going to have to cheat a
lot better or take an election off
because they're looking pretty
closely don't know and then my next
question would be the one thing that I
don't think observers can check not
easily is what happens if something
happened within the
machines what happens if uh everything
that you could observe was fine but then
when the final count got transmitted to
Some central place maybe it got tweaked
on the transfer how would you know now
the fact that we're not hearing any
complaints along those lines would
suggest that maybe there's some way to
know and and I wasn't aware of it if is
there a way to know if the electronic
machines are are correctly
tabulating now many of them have a a
paper ballot as well so you can compare
in those cases yes but once you transmit
it can you be sure that it transmitted
correctly I don't
know so I have many questions about was
I ever correct in my assumptions about
how leaky the election was or was I
completely correct and they cleaned up
the irq because I knew they were being
watched which would be very convenient
for me to be you know wrong but right
right so I have to ask myself i' better
question i' better question my whole
take on this
however um let's look at that claim that
there are 15 million fewer votes this
time and that therefore that proves that
2020 was rigged because where those
votes go well according to
Newsweek um there is no missing 15
million votes so they've they've said
it's false and others have said it's
false now here's their
argument the disparity between 2020 and
2024 appears to be a mixture of ballots
still being counted certain voter blocks
switching contest yet to be called and
slightly lower yet still very high
National turnout so the quoted number of
15 million quote missing Democrat
voters um is not
real do you buy
that does that
explanation totally answer all of your
questions well let's look at it another
way as of Sunday morning Trump had uh uh
more popular votes than I think any
Republic Ians gotten
in so long that you can't
remember um so Trump got about almost 75
million popular votes so far I think
they're still counting them and uh that
was even more than he got in 20120 which
was also a record over
2016 uh but not that much you know that
looks more like just the difference in
population now but President Biden still
has scored the largest raw count of the
popular vote of any contender in history
in
2020 so Trump seems to be winning with
75
million whereas Biden was winning one
with allegedly 81
million do you think that between last
election and this election that there
would be five
million-ish fewer people to vote against
Trump
do that does that sound real I would say
I would say the uh the claim that there
are missing votes in my opinion is still
completely
alive the the claim that there are 20
million is definitely debunked and the
claim that there will be 15 million
missing votes I think that's definitely
debunked but if we get down to let's
say 1 to 5 million votes that you
expected to be there that
aren't that would be more than enough to
throw any election I mean it would only
take a million votes if they were in the
right places to completely change an
election so we're not going to be able
to rule out the missing vote
hypothesis I hate that I I wish we would
know for sure because I think it'll you
know if it's within a few million of PRI
prior
elections it will be easy to dismiss it
and say well people weren't as excited
this time you know what I mean the the
if you just got a few million that are
unexplained any explanation will be fine
because it'll be a small percentage of
the total but it doesn't mean there was
no Shenanigans it just means we don't
know
anyway rasmuson uh asked the
voters what were their most important
issues and uh 32% said illegal
immigration that was the top answer 27%
said Rising prices now those would be uh
my opinions as well Rising prices I put
in the domain of the economy in general
and of course border security so on the
two most important things Trump had you
know the better policies people thought
so that alone should have explained how
we W if if you needed any other reason
how about the top two things that voters
wanted Trump was
offering how about that that'd be that'd
be enough I mean we have 50 different
reasons that people are offering for why
things went the way they are but one of
them could just be one of them addressed
the top interests of the country and the
other one
didn't so what are the other issues
24%
24% hm
24% that is nearly one quarter it's very
close to
25% and if you heard from me that
25% of uh respondents on a poll had a
certain opinion what would you think
about that opinion without even hearing
at
first you would say 25% of the people
who respond to any poll have the dumbass
answer that you can't even understand
how anybody could be that dumb 24% said
that the biggest issue was protecting
our
democracy protecting our
democracy it's like a completely madeup
issue and it turns out that more
Republicans voted for protecting our
democracy by putting Trump in in charge
than Democrats so it's this completely
madeup fake news propaganda thing that
we've been listening to for a year or
more and and uh 24% of the country
actually bought into the idea that that
was real do you know what else 24% of
the country could be convinced is
true ABS lutely
anything anything 24% of the country you
could absolutely convince that there is
a live UFO in the Oval Office yeah you
could anything you could convince 24% of
the public that Biden died a year ago
anything there's nothing you couldn't
convince them 24% can be convinced of
anything and so sure enough the uh the
people having their mental breakdowns
think that Hitler got into office and
they're losing their freedom but when
asked to list the freedoms they've
lost everything goes
quiet and they say stuff like
abortion which is fake news because
Trump says he's not going to do National
Abortion ban very clear about
it so they have to make up entire issues
that are the opposite of Trump's
policies in order to be
afraid why would you do that why would
you make up a a problem that's the
opposite of the person's
policy it's like you're just looking to
hurt yourself
somehow anyway and 14% said abortion
rights were the number one question
and then I say yes it's the number one
question for the
states not for the federal government
and not for Trump
so 14% couldn't even find the right
topic basically 25% get the wrong answer
14% don't understand the
question it was like you you didn't even
understand the question or you had no
idea what's going on
anyway a lot of people have been asking
me in the last few days how am I going
to
explain my support for Trump when I see
my trump hating family do any of you
have that
problem are any of you dreading the
holidays or already um kicked out of
your family because of your Trump
support and you're wondering how to deal
with your crazy family
members all
right well here's what what I would do I
would first of all um see if you can
grab a clip from I believe today is it
today or soon uh Biden will be meeting
with
Trump uh there will be I assume pictures
of them smiling and shaking hands and
then they'll have a private
conversation and then Biden will brag
he'll brag about how well they turn over
power
pely now when your relative say how
could you how could you elect Hiller and
take away all our democracy the first
thing you should say is you realized
that as soon as the election was over
the Democrats who were making those
claims acted like it never happened
right they acted like it never happened
because otherwise they couldn't smile
and shake hands and peacefully transfer
power they should be telling they should
be telling the country if everything
they had been saying up to that point
was true
that your democracy is going to be gone
what Biden should be doing is holding a
you know like a a Mourning in the you
know a morning as if like a death uh in
the Oval Office he should refuse to talk
to Trump now
orever they should look for every
possible way to reverse the election and
they should be working as hard as they
can to save us from Los losing our
democracy but instead
Biden's going to be smiling like a dumb
 shaking hands and bragging about
how he gave over power peacefully tayor
to Hitler peaceful peaceful transfer to
Hitler so if you're talking to your
relatives say I'd like you to explain to
me how the entire government just
started acting like it was normal that
Trump was going to be
president how'd that happen because the
frame you want to give your family is
that we live in a hoax
and that neither the left news or the
right news are even intended to be
accurate they're meant to be
narratives if you go in and say I read
real news and you read fake news your
argument will fail and you'll be kicked
out of the family if you go in and say
all news is fake when it comes to
politics um
and the way that I came to like Trump is
not believing anything
and making up my own mind and then you
show that the the news and the
politicians were clearly lying because
they're just treating him like a normal
president now clearly they were lying
obviously then the next thing you don't
want to do is point them to the American
debunk dcom site because that's got a
good write up of everything from the
fine people hoax to the other hoaxes and
how they were played so what you could
do is say here's the frame I would put
on it
people are going to ask you in your
family how could you do this and you'd
what you should say is I'd love to
explain it would you be willing to
actually
listen and then instead of talking about
policies you talk about the the
propaganda and
brainwashing situation on social media
and in the news and say that uh both
sides are just full of propaganda and
fake news and that uh if you wanted to
find out how badly you'd been duped look
at the American debunk
decom and uh and then you could say and
I'm not saying that I haven't been
fooled by any hoaxes I'm sure I have but
if you don't understand that you're in a
full 100% saturated hoax
ocracy then you're kind of lost you
won't understand the Trump support you
have to understand that none of the news
is real or nothing makes sense
the moment you realize the news is not
real and not trying to be real that's
important they're not trying to be real
then everything makes sense Everything
You observe suddenly makes sense once
you realize
that did you know there are two two
websites
for um people to make suggestions to our
government one to discuss
policy it's uh at policies forpop.com
policies for people
so if you've got an idea for a policy
that you think Trump could do something
about executive orders are great but it
could be anything else um that's up if
you want to discuss who should be
nominated um you should look at uh Mahan
now.org
so that as in make America healthy again
Maha M A now.org and then SL nominee
Das for- the- people I think you'll be
able to find that at Mahan now.org
so at least one of these was set up by
RFK
Jr um maybe Nicole Shanahan I'm
assuming I'm not sure about the other
one I saw something that said maybe both
of them were the work of uh RFK Jr but
I've been saying for a while that what
makes Trump special among other things
is that he listens to the public just
better than anybody ever has he can read
a room he adjusts he does ask for
opinions you know here here's something
that you hear everybody say when they
say they've spent time with
Trump they will say that he is
interested in your opinion and listens
very carefully to it and solicits it and
that was exactly my experience so you
know famously I always tell you I met
him in 2018
cuz I was a supporter and in the summer
the politics gets slow so I think the
White House was just you know bolstering
support among supporters so I got
invited in and I got to just sort of
hang with him for half an hour and just
shoot the breeze and where Trump took
the conversation was my opinion so
instead of telling me you know what
you'd expect if you listen to everything
from the Democrats you would expect that
he's a narcissist and that I would walk
in and he would tell me how great he is
slap me on the back and send me home
right like with having no interest
whatsoever at me he would just you know
tell me he's great give me his weird
handshake and send me
home it's the opposite of that he sits
down he starts asking me questions about
my business model for Dilbert yeah then
he asked me some some political
questions you know stuff that was in the
headlines he asked me who he thought he
was going to run against uh I said KL
Harris he said he thought it would be
Biden he was right um you know the
second B of the Apple I was right but he
was right that it would be Biden and the
next time and he listened to my answers
very carefully like you you are very
aware that he is giving you his full
attention and is actually interested in
the answer to his
question I don't know how many other
presidents do that
and and so it certainly it certainly
kicks the hell out of the whole
narcissist thing because if you ever met
a narcissist they don't do that they
don't say let's spend this half hour
listening to
you they fill it up with their own
thing anyway um so I think this is great
that there's a website that you can make
those suggestions looks like the border
security guy is going to be Tom Homan
again and um Republicans seem to love
Tom homman so he was in that job under
the first Trump Administration and uh
he's going to close down that border and
Deport things Deport people As Trump
requires um Jim Jordan was asked about
the mass deportations he had a pretty
good answer you might want to use this
one yourself so Jim Jordan says that
there are 1.3 million people in the
country who have been ordered deported
already um because they lost their
Asylum claims and he says that Trump
will start there well if the courts have
already ordered 1.3 million to go home
how long would it take to round up the
criminals and the 1.3 million that the
courts have said have to
leave it's going to take all four years
you know even if you wanted to do mass
deportations and I don't I don't
actually think anybody wants to uh you
know if if you really talk to people
privately do you need all 20 million to
go home you know we're going to be 10
million short workers if you do that and
they're paying taxes so most people I
think in the real world if if they were
in charge they would go after all the
ones that are a big problem or have been
legally
ejected and
uh and you'd be in good
shape so if we just do that we'll be
fine and then uh Jim Jordan was
emphasizing again that Trump's going to
focus on getting the work done and he's
not going after political
enemies I do
wonder if it even makes sense for Trump
to deny that he's going after political
enemies or would it be better for them
to think that he is so they shape up and
then just not do
it I mean so
part of me wants to say you you fools
don't you know that Trump is not going
to go after political enemies but first
of all I don't know that who knows um I
do know that there would be huge
resistance to it from Republicans I
would resist it if it were just lawfare
and it's just Revenge oh I'm going to
resist that hard I don't want I don't
want to be associated with that in any
way but there may be a few
characters that have uh earned a little
special
treatment it's not GNA be Rachel madow
and it's not gonna be Joy Reed I mean
honestly if Trump went after Joy
Reed like I would stop everything I'm
doing and say I don't know what this is
but you you need to stop that right away
like that that does not fly all right
you you don't go get to go after
somebody who said bad things about you
nope nope nope but there are other
people like the January 6 committee who
probably broke real laws I mean it looks
like it from my perspective I don't have
proof of that but I think there is
evidence of uh information that was held
back and you there there are some claims
there that I think need to be looked at
because if the January 6 committee was
corrupt and it certainly looks like they
were the the damage to the country
is just enormous so I think that needs
to be looked at but no not uh certainly
not people in the
news uh well we're looking for a speaker
of the house and uh I guess it's down to
who is it Corin th and Rick
Scott um I'm looking at the people who
are backing each of them I'm noticing
that Rick Scott has the backing of Elon
Musk so far are f g
Jr um I think CNO Mike cernovich was for
Rick Scott and I mentioned that Rand
Paul was endorsing him and uh I Look to
Rand Paul as my guide on this decision
and as I told you before wouldn't you
love to be in this
position to have lived your life in such
a way that you are so credible that
somebody will just take your word for
for a very important decision that's
where Rand Paul is for me so if Rand
Paul says I know these three people this
one's the right answer I'm
done I'm done is there somebody that has
higher
credibility who has a different opinion
why I haven't heard anybody you there
there are lots of other people backing
other people Rick Scott is actually the
in the minority now I think th has the
most backing but who's backing th that I
would say oh oh if you're back in th I
guess I'm in who would that be who who's
backing Corin and again I don't know
anything about TH or Corin but who's
back in Corin that as soon as I hear
that name I'd go oh oh I'll take a look
at Corin if you told me that Elon Musk
had backed one of them I'd say oh I
better look at him if RFK Jr was backing
one of them I'd say I'm GNA look at him
if cernovich was backing somebody else
I'd say oh better look at him but if you
give me Rand Paul cernovich Elon Musk
and RFK Jr and they're all for Rick
Scott I don't have any further
questions I that's all I need to here
because if you've got somebody who's
more credible than the people I just
mentioned and you know and and also
plugged in so they would know you know
the characters there's nobody more
credible than those people that I just
mentioned so to me even not knowing any
anything about the three people who who
are up for it I feel like the decision's
easy I
do all right um Bernie Sanders continues
to entertain you know I have a love
LoveHate relationship with Bernie
Sanders because I think his policies are
not necessarily good for the country but
you know the co the country apparently
decided that he's not going to get his
way so that's okay but he is a good
truth tell he is a populist
uh I do believe he wants what's good for
the country and so he's fun to watch and
um he says that Harris lost because
Democrats abandoned the working
class and I think uh the DNC National
chair labeled it BS and Nancy Pelosi got
mad at him for saying that now there are
a lot of reasons given for why things
didn't go well and as I've said the
answer is everything
every single thing the Democrats did was
bad compared to Trump they were less
organized they had less time they had a
worse candidate they had a candidate who
couldn't talk they had policies that
were ridiculous they had a VP who wasn't
as good as Trump's VP uh Trump got
nearly assassinated she got the job
without going through a uh a
primary there there wasn't actually
anything
there was not a single thing they Harris
did better than Trump am I wrong about
that is that just me being biased and
you know my confirmation bias is kicking
in or is that just objectively true and
a smart Democrat would admit it if they
were talking to you privately I think
every single thing about her campaign if
you lined it up on a chart okay okay you
know this to this this to this the only
place she might
is in ground game and in funding and
guess what I sound like Biden now guess
what the ground game didn't matter and
the superior funding didn't matter
because Trump got the free the free
publicity better which he teases her
because he says he'll help pay off her
debts he has lots of money left over he
has money left
over so he handled his money better
did everything better he had better he
had better slogans he had better focus
he had better debates in my
opinion uh so if you're looking for the
mystery of how Trump won how about the
strongest politician that we've ever
seen ran against the worst politician
we've ever seen and every single thing
he did was really good and every single
thing she
did that mattered because it turned out
the funding didn't matter was
suboptimal so it it's sort of like you
can pick your own reason because you got
50 of them everything was
less everything they did was
less all right um David
aerod says that the only group Democrats
gained with in the election were white
college
graduates so how would you like to be
the Democrat party the party of minority
interests in the working class and the
only people you gained with were the
people who were supposed to be your
enemies are are you supposed to be
working on behalf of rich white
women is that is that the Democrat Party
is the party of rich white women with
good
educations so he said uh Axel Rod said
the Dems have become the party of
suburban college educated smarty pants
now why would it be that that
group would be moving in in that
direction when all the other groups are
moving the other direction now your
first thought would be well abortion
obviously nope it's not abortion because
it didn't affect the other
women and all women would be in the same
boat abortion wise so if there's only
one group of
women who went uh went toward Harris
it's not because of
abortion because that that would be more
of a a general move so it wasn't
that um here's why I think the Suburban
college educated smarty
pants uh women are the ones who move
toward
Harris they're the most
hypnotized because everybody watches the
news or social media is under some kind
of influence including me and
you but if you went through college
you're really getting it like you're
really really really getting it but then
the question would
be what about the white men who went who
went to college because apparently they
didn't go in Harris's Direction either
they also went more toward Trump what
about them why why would the men who had
the same largely exactly the same um
influence Go in different direction now
you might say abortion but like I said
abortion doesn't seem to explain much
didn't it didn't seem to influence the
election that
much here's what I
think I think men are harder to
and they care less about woke
stuff and that was probably the
difference in other words men had a
natural uh a natural defense to being
hypnotized to be woke and being
hypnotized about anything else so so
they can be hypnotized men of course
could be just as hypnotized as women but
I think they had a little natural
immunity in this case just it's a
hypothesis by the way it's a it's my
sexist
hypothesis um and part of it is that
that men when they speak
privately it's different than what they
say publicly I don't know about women
but uh I just think men were less
hypnotizable
and maybe that was the whole
story
anyway um there's a claim in the New
York Post that some say that Biden when
he was still running his internal polls
had Trump winning 400 electoral votes
now this comes from an ex Obama official
so we don't know if that's true but
would that have been amazing if Trump
won 400 votes but you know what is the
best thing about Biden dropping
here's what I wouldn't have wanted I
would not have wanted a president Trump
who won because the the competitor was
having
dementia there's no credibility there
right yeah if the person you beat didn't
even look like they could have done any
job including working at McDonald's like
literally couldn't have done a job at
McDonald's if if that's who you
beat then you're not really that that
credible as a
leader but if you beat you know the as I
call her vagina Jesus Harris she's got
the the black woman thing going on and
the black Indian thing going on and
she's you know she's young and she's
picked and she's proven and she's had
some you know experience in the right
kind of jobs if you beat her and you
beat her like conclusively well then you
get a mandate that's a mandate I don't
know if beating the dementia patient
gives you a
mandate people would claim it but you
wouldn't feel it with the Harris Victory
you actually feel the
Mandate if he beat Biden you just say
well everybody would be Biden I mean he
wasn't even
there so it turns out that the best
thing that could have been done for
Trump is trading out
Biden nothing could have been better for
Trump and the Republicans than having a
clean win you know you could argue she
only had 107 days but I'm going to go
with Bill Maher because I think he he
spoke the Common Sense on this are you
kidding us she was the vice president of
the United States and she had 107 days
and we were all concentrating intensely
of course she had time to introduce
herself to the country now she didn't
have time to to work her way into your
mind so deeply that it's like Trump the
first name that comes to your your mind
when you think of variety of things but
I don't know if that would helped you
know the the indication is the the more
we knew about her the the worse she was
so I think maybe the short time to do
the thing worked in her favor it was
probably the best I could have done
keeper around of the
news anyway then uh let's
see um Morning Joe is blaming white
progressives for Harris's loss uh and
and uh so this is Morning Joe so he's
actually it's almost like he's
criticizing himself but doesn't realize
it he goes what on Earth is latinx no
Latino person uses the word latinx but
people spouted this because they felt
they had
to and so he's basically saying that
this one group The White progressives
got everything
wrong to which I say Morning
Joe where are the white progressives
getting their news
where are they getting their news
they're getting it from Joe the the the
news people are
absolutely just dead set that people are
making up their own mind without
information the only information that
voters have comes through social media
and the news and most of the social
media is based on the news so if they
can't see that they are the problem and
that the candidate is actually
Downstream from them they're just never
going to be able to correct which is
great because if they don't correct
that's good for me
so as long as they're pretty sure the
problem is white
people
uh they're they're not going to correct
now here's what I mean I think if you
watch the fake news long enough you know
it's fake news and
that
[Music]
um that's really the big problem is just
we live in a
hoxy all right then I saw a article by
Michael tomasi who's speculating that
why Trump won is that even though we
think the mainstream media is all
anti-trump that really the right-wing
media is stronger than the
left do you buy
that do you buy that the right-wing
media is now stronger than the left-wing
media the right-wing media had something
like 88% negative stories about Trump
and almost no negative stories about
Harris and it is the most viewed news
now Fox News is bigger than any of the
individual other news entities but it's
because it's operating you know with
Breitbart and the Gateway pundit and
just the news there are only a handful
of entities and most of them are small
comp compared to Fox
News um I see I see some of well we'll
talk about that in a minute there
there's somebody in the comments yelling
in all com in all capitals that bill
Ply's giving away money to people was a
scam now I know Bill personally I was
very close to the whole process of the
giveaway here's how the scam worked if I
give you money will you enjoy it yes
okay I'm going to give you some money
did you enjoy it yes I think I'll do it
again hey does anybody else want some
free money hey I do all right here's
some did you enjoy it yes that really
helped that was his
scam he he literally thought that if he
just gave money to people and made them
happy that they would be happy and then
he did
that now now if if you're yelling me in
all caps that you think there was some
trick to it that he was he was buying
supporters was he buying
supporters well only if you want to be a
jerk about it he was giving money away
his own money to people and asking
nothing in return except that they had
described a need that sounded
genuine and did that make him get lots
and lots of uh supporters of course I
did so are you telling me that you
shouldn't do things that are kind and
generous and good for people because
you'll be a scammer because you might be
popular for doing that no I'd like
everyone to scam me that way can you
please scam me by giving me money that
is exactly what I need to solve my
problems so so back down you're being
like just a dumbass and by the way if if
Bill P gets picked for the HUD yeah I'm
I'm hoping that he would take that job
um getting ahead of myself but if he's
available for
it uh I think he would add one to two
points to the GDP I mean honestly I
think you're looking at one of the
biggest opportunities the country's ever
had to put somebody with his mindset and
his background and his skill and his
brain behind housing you know our
biggest most expensive problem that we
really really need to fix but is also
connected to employment in the deepest
way and it's now going to be connected
to the Robot World in the deepest way I
mean you need you need at least a bill p
in that job to get all the you know
squeeze all the goodness out of
it so if you could not do dumbass things
like pretending that giving your own
money away to people who need it is some
kind of a
scam we really don't need that like
you're talking about trillions of
dollars on the line here so so don't
don't start dumb
rumors that could cost the country a
trillion dollars that that's not
helping all
right so let's
see
um oh so here here's what the uh the
writer Michael taski said um he he said
people are incred incredulous how a
majority of Voters could have um
believed this or that
and uh the writer says that weren't they
bothered that Trump is a convected Fain
con convected convicted
felon um he calls him an adjudicated
rapist he said he invocated violence
against Liz Cheney or 50 other examples
of his disgusting imprecations uh why
didn't people see that he was obviously
disqualified for all that to which I say
huh sounds like somebody who wasn't see
enough the right-wing
media because if you followed the
right-wing media you would know all this
is
 if you followed the leftwing
media which he doesn't think is strong
you would think all these things are
real things these are real things this
just made up by the right ring
right-wing
media yeah
anyway um Don Brazil said uh we got to
do a better job of reaching the voters
where they are and not try to make
pretend that this is one simply because
Donald Trump is a better
liar so so don of Brazil
um is one of my favorite
pundits she you know no matter where she
is she's she's always interesting I even
liked her when she was on the five for a
while as the you know the the the Lefty
person because she's always
interesting and but look at this turn of
a
phrase um we can't pretend that that
Trump only won because he's a better
liar do do you see what's in that
phrase better
liar she literally just called her own
team
liars and said they lost to a better
liar now actually she's saying don't
don't say this but she's suggesting that
Democrats know their Liars but they
didn't lie well enough
and I've actually had that thought
because they went all in on the he's
Hitler and he's a racist but since theyd
already dialed that up to 10 they didn't
have anywhere to go so there was nothing
they could say that could move the dial
because the dial was set at 10 they they
had already said it there
so I think it's hilarious to see that
she would use the phrase better
liar so at least the people who were the
deepest into politics know it's a
competition between two Liars
basically
um apparently according to uh Harry anon
on CNN Trump created the most diverse
Republican party of all
time so because Trump won on all the
categories except for the educated white
women um he made he made the Republican
Party the most diverse it's ever been in
all
history at the same time that the
mainstream media is painting him as
Hitler and a
racist he he he he basically took the
Nobel Prize in in diversity
without I was going to say without
trying but that's that that's fake that
that would have been incorrect he was
trying he was doing it the way a
republican does it do you know how a
republican increases diversity
ask Morgan
Freeman Morgan Freeman will tell you how
to increase diversity and decrease you
know racial animosity you know what you
do you stop talking about
it you just ignore it you just do all
the things that you should do you make
the economy better oh guess what it
helps everybody you improve let's say
competition for school oh guess what
everybody had a better deal because of
that if you just do everything right
keep on a Wars pay down the debt just
the things that everybody needs it turns
out that everybody likes it surprise
things that are good for everybody are
good for everybody and that was enough
that's how you build diversity the
Republican way you just say who's
telling you you can't get an ID you can
get an ID who's telling you you can't
get a job in America you can get a job
in
America and and just sort of ignore it
until it goes away
now the the spin that I put on it
is that as long as you focus on groups
like group averages you're in sort of an
absurd crazy land that doesn't make
sense in 2024 or five but if you focus
on individuals you solve every
problem every problem because
individuals have unique problems if if
you said uh let's let me solve all the
black people problems
well what would that be because you got
plenty of black people in great jobs
they've got great educations you know
they're killing it they're you know
they've got good families and stuff
so how'd they do that if you just say
here's somebody who's undereducated so I
need to give them a skill it shouldn't
matter what the race is so ignoring
ignoring the differences in the averages
is where we need to get to Trump's
already there and it paid
off and again it's the Republican way to
do the long-term payoff you know you
move you move uh abortion out of the
Supreme Court you're going to get killed
in the next
election but
eventually the states will work it out
and it won't become a problem every time
for the Republicans at the federal level
and same here if you just make sure that
you get the economy right and you're not
overtly discriminating against anybody
still there is um you know systemic
racism still there but there are so many
ways to get around it that it would be
like it isn't
there so specific example is if you
assume systemic racism exists but you
also got a good education and you know
in some job that people people have in
demand you're going to do great and
maybe even your race and ethnicity and
your sexual preference might even be a
plus if it's a big corporate job or
something like
that all right so yes the most
diverse group by simply not making a big
pandering deal about
it um Stephanie rule on
MSNBC says that musk and the
disinformation from people like him and
his xplatform created the Trump
presidency
really it it was just Elon Musk saying
things that weren't true he he was the
one it wasn't
MSNBC it wasn't the fact that people saw
through
MSNBC and they could see that he wasn't
the monster you know I don't know how
much this mattered and I don't know if
there's any way to know
but um early on in the election I had
speculated that if you you could get rid
of Trump's worst criticism you know that
he's uh selfish and um he's a selfish
racist that you could get rid of that by
putting him in contact with ordinary
people because if you spend two minutes
with him you just don't pick that up
like that's anything you just think oh
he's really interested in me he seems
like a nice guy oh he's serving french
fries at McDonald's oh isn't that funny
he's in that garbage truck just like a
garbage guy you know oh he went to the
black barber shop
and sure enough Trump did all these
things where it put him in direct
contact with voters and then if you even
if you're just watching it you're seeing
him act like just a person and then all
those things about he's Hitler and
everything else you're trying to
reconcile that but the visual of him
acting like a regular person who's
respected and respects the Ordinary
People is so much more powerful than
he's Hitler he's Hitler he's Hitler you
know that's so ridiculous that people
don't believe that
naturally so I think that that was a
genius of the campaign is that they they
made that adjustment I think it really
worked and by the way let me say this
again uh what's name is it uh WS is the
name of the chief of staff do you
remember me saying for the past year
that it it seems screamingly obvious
that the Trump
campaign was the best run it's ever been
and it is just like screamingly capable
like you you could just everything they
did seemed like just the right move all
the
time
now that's a pretty good person to pick
is your Chief of Staff you know the the
woman who pulled that off yeah Susie WS
so Susie WS as chief of
staff and he doesn't make a big deal
about the first
woman that's the way to do it that's how
you do it yeah you you just pick the
best people and make sure that people
know they're the best people and you
just move on and guess what women now
know that they could be the chief of
staff and who didn't know that
anyway
anyway uh even on CNN though uh and I'll
give CNN credit for that their opinions
are not unified about what happened so U
fared Zakaria he says he blames the
Democrats for for not doing enough about
illegal immigration or not even not
understanding how big a deal it was uh
he didn't like the law fair against
Trump he thinks that moves the voters
and the deeply illiberal woke culture of
censorship so according to fared it was
the way the Democrats
acted and I'm thinking okay that's close
but
again why why did they act that
way you know I I'm still waiting for
somebody on CNN or MSNBC to say you know
what maybe maybe the voters act the way
we tell them to act because the voters
act the way they tell them to act most
people don't come up with their own
opinions that's very rare they watch
their TV and they say that sounds right
to me that's my opinion
now anyway according to Breitbart 40% of
women under 30 voted for
Trump now it's not over
half but it would suggest that Trump is
not um he's not poisoned to Women Voters
40% is a good healthy message that you
know a small tweak would get him over
half and uh representative Jim
Jordan says he's opened the possibility
of uh asking Jack Smith the uh special
counsel to testify
if um I think that would be a good
idea I feel like uh if the Republicans
hold the
house um I think maybe they should talk
to the January 6 people and talk to the
lawfare prosecutors and maybe see if
there's something the public needs to
know about that whole
situation that's what I
think well I'm going to end early today
um that's all I got for
you and uh I'm going to talk to the
locals people privately remember the
