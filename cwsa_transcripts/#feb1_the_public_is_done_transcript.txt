feed to catch up
and then we're going to do a special
purpose
double whiteboard yeah
it's better than one
double whiteboard
and i'm going to run an idea past you
in a way
you have just become part of the
first digital constitutional congress
in which i will be proposing
a non-binding amendment to the
constitution
a system if you will a new process
i'm going to run it by all of you for
opinion
so you're going to see it for the first
time
all right
so as you know there are some situations
for which our government is ill-equipped
one of those would be getting a budget
approved
am i right they'll throw everything
together into a big bill until nobody
likes any of it
and they just can't get past it
so is there any kind of process that
would help them get past that it's
almost like you need a hostage
negotiator
somebody independent who just goes in
and says all right all right let's try
to make a deal here and get something
done likewise with the pandemic
we've got this situation where the
government is really the worst tool for
the job
if you're in a war like a real war
the government's the best tool for the
job
absolutely you want somebody to organize
and organize quickly and have that kind
of power
but as we're deciding to get back to
something like normal life
the government is the worst tool for
that job
because the government
can't make a wrong decision
and
expect to keep their jobs
and anything that requires more people
to die
even if there's a trade-off of freedom
if it's not in the context of a regular
shooting war
it's going to be bad for a politician so
they really can't make the cost-benefit
analysis
that the public requires
so what do you do
and that's where a hostage negotiator
comes in and i'm going to
lay out a process
for getting past log jams
with a
something i'm going to call a hostage
negotiator borrowing that term from greg
gutfeld
and
the idea is
that if you had a certain situation
somebody could number one
self-appoint themselves
with a three replacement option
here's the part that i want to run past
you
because there would be no process for
let's say electing or appointing
a hostage negotiator
it's something that would have to arise
by some kind of person just wanting to
do it
in this case
i will act as that person just to see if
the process works
and the process is that the first person
who goes
into this process has to make a little
bit of a impact
in other words get a maybe get a hashtag
trending or give some agreement
somewhere just a little bit of an impact
but
in order to be credible as a hostage
negotiator they should have
three people named
as replacements in other words three
people who would just have to say you
know i could do that better than you
i'll take your job
and they automatically get it for
example
i would name i'll give you one example
i'll name sam harris
as somebody who said if he said
hypothetically
if he were to say you know i like this
idea of a hostage negotiator but you're
bad at it
or you're not credible or it's just not
going over with the public for some
reason
as soon as you said that if you wanted
to legitimately take over i would say
perfect that's exactly how the system
works
if you want to do it
go ahead but i would ask him to do the
same thing
list three credible people
that if they just said you know um
you're a mess i'm gonna take over that
they could do it so
so what would be sam harris maybe uh
i'll come up with a couple more
now
uh just think about that for a moment
and you know roll it around in your head
what can go wrong you know how many ways
could it go wrong now if the first thing
if the first thing that you're thinking
is uh i don't like sam harris you have
to wait for the other two names right
because nobody's going to like any one
of the names just like every other form
of government nobody's going to like all
of it right so remember you have to
accept
that this is a process in which all of
us will find something we don't like
that's not that's not disqualifying
that's the that's a symbol of a good a
good system actually if negotiating is
involved
so
let me uh
say this the hostage negotiator would be
there to assist the government not
replace it
it would not be
a
it would not be a battle
it would be helping the government fill
in a a capability that it simply doesn't
have and can't have in this special
circumstance
and that that ability is to tell us you
know some of you are going to die but
let's get back to work
government just can't say that
so it would be greatly aided by somebody
else saying it and then
simply agreeing with it or going the way
that the majority goes but
i don't think it's a case of just asking
something from the government
the public should be willing to offer
something as well
so as a negotiator i would
make some specific offers i'll tell you
about the minute
the idea would be to negotiate
creatively
offers that are not a standard
republican offer or a standard democrat
offer
just be creative just throw some extra
things in there maybe take some things
out of there just see what you can do
that the public would get behind
but
here's here's the key trigger
the hostage negotiator would not approve
of any deal
without getting 75 percent of the public
on board
so in other words the hostage negotiator
would have zero power
as it should be
only the public would have the power
but the public would have to get up to
speed
be well informed
and then by a 75 percent majority
then the the government is safe
why is the government safe
because if you can get a majority that
big for anything
your politicians are completely safe
they can just say look there was a 75
majority for this
nobody went against it in fact
at that at that point you'd probably get
something like 100
congressional approval of stuff you know
with a few holdouts
so here's what a opening offer would
look like
look like this
and again this is just a model
for how something like this could work
so don't get too caught up on the
specifics the reason i'm showing it to
you is gate is to get your opinions okay
um
nothing happens until you have a target
at least nothing good unfortunately
things unfortunately things happen but
they're not good
anybody who knows anything about
management will agree with the following
statement
if you're not measuring something
and have some specific looking
direction
nothing good is going to happen
you can't just go to work every day and
try to be good at your job
that's not anything you have to have a
direction and you've got to be able to
measure if the things you're doing are
working or not working if you're not
doing that
it's unmanaged
and the pandemic feels unmanaged to the
public
it's not really unmanaged but it feels
that way to us because there's no
specific thing being measured
toward a specific end goal now suppose
somebody said all right we'll measure
statistics of infections or deaths or
hospitalizations what do all of you say
i don't trust those numbers right
i don't trust those numbers
so instead of trusting those numbers i
would propose the following
that
we would manage it by saying february
1st is our target can we get the
government to say yes the biden
administration maybe the governors
because remember this is state and
federal negotiation
can you get everybody to say yes
but we would hold them not responsible
if we have to change that target
you have to have a target but it's crazy
if you don't change it if the data
changes or the situation changes you
have to have some kind of a target we'll
talk about systems over goals but in a
specific case since it's obvious that we
all want to get get back to freedom
there's no ambiguity about what the end
state is right there's no ambiguity if
there were then a system would be better
than a goal but in this specific case
where everybody knows exactly what they
want which is get back to normal life
safely enough
then
that's a little less of an issue all
right
so we would hold our politicians uh not
to blame for any excess deaths that came
as a result of this negotiation and we
would say that we would not hold them to
the decision of february first unless by
that date
a credible polling company of people who
are well informed
of course that might be hard to define
but of people who are well informed
75 percent of them agree that feb first
still works
what do you think
now of course the government government
would not be bound to any of this it
would simply give them an extra path
that's not available to them now and the
extra path is to follow the lead of the
public
right now that's not an option right
because the public's a little bit
you know too split and we don't have uh
yeah we wouldn't all agree on the end
date
now for this to work
it would require not the 75 agreed
and here's an important point this would
be a little bit like a jury trial
it's not that you get 75 on the same
page
it's that you get 75 to say it's time to
make a decision
which is a little bit different
right it's the people who say all right
all right i get it
you just need a few more votes
we need to get past this i wouldn't have
picked february first i might have
picked march 1st but i'm not going to be
the one to stop it for those 30 days so
you need a lot of people who are sort of
you know
in the middle
to be convinced that we just need
decisions
all right
um
you're forgetting there's a lot of
psychos
out there that love this stuff
okay
um i don't know exactly how that would
how exactly that would work now i'm
seeing some stuff on locals that i won't
call out
but i want to i want to emphasize
that if you make it a combative process
with the government instead of an
additive process
you're not going to get very far
because everybody's first reaction is to
bristle and
try to maintain power etc so it has to
be an assistance
period
and the first person who starts
something going
needs to be willing to george washington
it
does everybody know what that means
to george washington
whoever goes first has to be willing to
get out of there really fast
because otherwise the system has no
credibility it requires a
a flow of credible people through it
some some better than others right
but at this point the
the way our system is designed it just
doesn't have the ability to get past log
jams the way the public would like it to
so we could give it that cover
with a different hostage negotiator for
each topic you wouldn't want the same
one for more than one topic i would i
would say
so even to get the ball rolling i don't
even know if you'd want one to get the
ball rolling more than once even if they
were quickly replaced
all right
yeah trump trump is too polarizing so
you want people who you can't find
anybody who has no connection to
politics
because the the trump era
ended the days when anybody didn't have
an opinion
we're done with that
so you need people who at least have
some record
of
appreciating
arguments on both sides
at the very least and they should have
some level of rational
uh established ability
that
is you know obvious to everybody
so i i heard somebody suggest uh naval
rav account he would be on my list all
right so you beat me to that one
i doubt he'd do it
which is exactly the kind of person you
want
is that somebody who would be the last
person in the world who would agree to
something like that
that's who you want
all right um
well here's the thing you want people
who are
not just popular i'm saying joe rogan
being suggested the trouble with doc
with joe rogan
is that he is great at what he does
but i don't know that the left in
particular would recognize him as having
the let's say intellectual
independence or depth i hate to say that
because he's one of the smartest guys
around but
uh you're looking for somebody who's got
that
sort of statistical i guess that's the
best way to say it somebody who has a
statistical
appreciation of the arguments
i think you need that at least
sheldenberger is good
yeah i like van jones
um would be good
especially because he's shown
appreciation for both sides of arguments
um
tom brady
that's funny
sting
all right now we're just doing funny
names all right i'm seeing dr drew's
name go by and he was actually one of
the first people i thought of but on
second thought
should we include medical professionals
at all
here's why
i believe that politicians and the
entire medical community has the same
problem
which is the risk of being wrong at this
level
is a career ending problem
would it be a career rendering for for
me
if i were to negotiate
something that was sub-optimal well i
may not take for for a long time
but i could put up with that like for me
i don't really see the downside
but if you actually are a medical
professional i think it's too dangerous
and i wouldn't recommend it because i'm
not sure i would
trust a medical professional
to be free of the constraint of their
own professional risk it would be way
out of line with the
with what would be asked of them
now would i expect
to get lots of doctors to weigh in
and to agree and to publicly say yes or
no let's say on february 1st yes yes so
you'd want to really pay attention to
the medical professional opinion above
others i think but you don't want them
to be the ones whose name is attached to
it i think that's just more than you
want to ask a medical professional
in these polarized times and this
polarized question
uh so i would say nobody who's directly
associated with politics so you know
trump's great negotiator but
for this exactly the wrong person
you'd want
somebody said micro
you know that was one of the first ones
i thought of too
but primarily because of his
sort of common sense likability
but i still think
you need somebody
you feel more comfortable
could go a little bit lower into the
or deeper into the
the science of it
i i'd want somebody who's got a proven
ability to to go deeper than i can go
that would be
you know something i'd be looking for
all right um
neil degrasse tyson oh there you go
there you go i mean the perfect the
perfect trio would be
um
white black and female right
yeah if you had to have if you're gonna
name three people in today's
polarized world because remember you're
trying to get credibility and you're
trying to get everybody on board
so while i can make an argument there
are lots of times you don't want to go
all awoke
this wouldn't be one of them
this is this is one of those times where
extra wokeness is just as utility
it just has utility because it's not
like there's only three people in the
world you know that would qualify as
good for this position
uh elon musk would have been my top
choice i'm seeing that suggested over
the locals network
yeah elon musk would be able to look at
the science has the popularity on
enough of the world but he's a little
bit polarizing and maybe the left has a
little bit of a problem with him
jordan peterson uh not american
not american
i feel like you need an american on this
one although
i know
do you i guess i'd be open to that i
guess i made an assumption without
thinking about it too hard um yeah
jordan peterson would have the
all of the capabilities plus the
communication ability that literally no
one has
by the way i've never seen a better
communicator than jordan peterson
i've never seen anything like it
um all right that's all i had to say for
today i was expecting more pushback
can can i get just a final opinion
of uh what looked good or not in this
idea worth a try because we can a b test
it i mean we could just
we're testing it right now if it doesn't
work
nobody will care the hashtag will die
tomorrow
you know
we'll give it a try remember
everything's non-binding everything's
negotiable
and everything's public and you know no
no negotiating behind closed doors so
um
i'm mostly getting good responses which
i wasn't actually expecting
i shouldn't be so surprised yeah i
wasn't expecting a good response frankly
but
um
all right so we're off and running then
based on your response
we are we're live so this is the opening
offer
opening offer to the biden
administration and all governors that
this is applicable to i realize many of
you live in a state
where you already have all the freedom
you want but for the rest of us
we would appreciate some backup
and again i'll tell you uh in fact
maybe i'll just say if anybody wants to
step forward and take over for me
if they've got basic capabilities which
is
you're sure that they could
see things on both sides of the
political aisle and they have some depth
more depth than i have and i don't have
enough so i'd like to get it replaced as
soon as possible if you could do that
for me
just replace me as soon as possible
anyway that's the opening offer
february 1st but
it doesn't count
unless 75 percent of the well-informed
people
also agree that it's time
that's the opening offer
and
i would hold
blameless
the government for changing the date if
they need to
if the situation changes and hold them
not responsible for any extra deaths
that they could have avoided by being
more stringent
but 75 percent let's see if we can get
there
all right now keep in mind if we get
surprised in january all bets are off
everybody understand that right
you all understand if we get some big
surprise
all bets are off you have to have to
rethink it from the start but without
any big surprises feb 1
public is done
by the way did anybody uh notice that
rhymes
feb 1 the public is done
it's hard not to say isn't it
about the first time you hear it
you want to roll it around your head
fab one the public is done
yeah that's not an accident
all right that's it for today
and i'll talk to you later
