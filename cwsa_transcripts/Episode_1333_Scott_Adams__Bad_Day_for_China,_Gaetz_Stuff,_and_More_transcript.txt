hey everybody
come on in it's a holiday weekend
and i've gotta check the answer to a
question i just asked
um we'll get to that in a minute
uh yeah i was almost 30 seconds late and
i know that's distressing for many of
you
because when you're waiting for the
simultaneous sip
any delay is just unconscionable
isn't it it seems this light is making
me look bad
yeah turns out it was just the light
otherwise i look great
why do i look like i'm lit up like a
light bulb
all right well let's get to it you know
if you'd like to enjoy this
better than well better than everybody
else is enjoying anything right now
all you need is a couple of margaret
glass a tanker tells the style a canteen
jerk flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine hit of the day the thing makes
everything
better watch it it's called the
simultaneous sip and here it comes
so i told you that because periscope was
shutting down
and i was going to look at some other
platforms
i checked out rumble yesterday and my
understanding is they do not have
live streaming yet but they plan to have
it
is that true because i looked at their
interface both on mobile and
uh browser and did not see any feature
which would allow me to
live cast so uh won't happen on rumble
right away
i also tried uh that haps tv h-a-p-p-s
dot tv and when i tried live streaming
it
live streaming to twitch and youtube at
the same time
just as a test uh it didn't have the
performance
i needed at high quality so i think
there might be a performance
issue uh if you go to high quality
and i don't want to step down the
quality just to
use that tool so the current situation
is
there is no uh sufficient
alternative to youtube at the moment
uh the locals pro platform uh will have
one
at some point and i'll let you know
about that
all right here's what's going on i was
wondering
how bad the covet situation is
in terms of your real life
so forget about the statistics how much
of it is affecting
like the actual infections are affecting
your real life
and so i asked a highly unscientific
poll
on twitter and 21 of you who
answered my highly unscientific poll
21 percent of you say you know somebody
that has coveted right now
it's like right now you know somebody
who has covered
and i asked that question because i
don't know anybody who has it and i
haven't heard of anybody
even indirectly you know a real person
i haven't even heard of anybody in about
a week
and i wondered if that meant anything
but
so many people have responded and say
they do know somebody
they have it themselves their spouse has
it so there's a ton of people
a ton of people who know somebody who
has it but what's interesting is
that 79 of the people who answered the
polls said they don't even know anybody
who had it in the last week
don't even know anybody and the ones who
said they do know somebody in the last
week
given the way people answer questions on
twitter
how many of them answer the right
question
you could tell by the answers that
something like a third of the people who
read the question
didn't understand the question and
answer the wrong question a lot of them
answered that they had once had it or
they knew somebody who had it long ago
or somebody died with it and that wasn't
the question
so i'm thinking something i'll bet the
21 is closer to 10
so something like 10 of the respondents
again highly unscientific
even know somebody who hasn't but still
plenty
so we're still we still have a problem
um
there's an interesting thing developing
that
i i feel sometimes when you have an
understanding of persuasion
you can kind of see around corners a
little bit
you know what's behind the corner before
you look just because you know how
things work
and there's a thing happening that some
major corporations are blundering into
that they do not see coming but i think
i see it clearly coming
and i'm going to describe it to you and
most of you have
endured my lessons on persuasion and i
want to see if you see it too
and it goes like this so we've got our
fortune 500 companies your
your coca-colas and your deltas
saying that georgia is a bad state and
you know maybe they should not do
business with georgia or
yeah they have some issues with georgia
because of georgia's
uh changes to their voting
rules which put georgia from the
uh the bottom near the bottom of the
list of election security
according to third parties who look at
this stuff
so georgia went from the least one of
the least
secure voting systems
to finally up in you know the middle of
the pack with these latest changes
uh but of course that looks like jim
crow racism to people on the left
and i have to be honest it's both
isn't it you know the the way we argue
is that there's only one right side and
the other side is completely wrong
right there's only one side that's right
and the other side
completely wrong there's nothing to
their argument whatsoever
that's definitely not the case in this
case
i think that it can be true at the same
time
that these election changes are racist
meaning that they have an outcome which
disproportionately
you know influences some group more than
another
i think that's obvious right and it's
not because
that doesn't necessarily mean that
that's the intention although you have
to worry about that
but the outcome of any big change almost
always has some racial
disproportionate outcome anything you do
with taxes
is racially disproportionate uh
everything really anything big that
affects the country
has uneven outcomes racially no matter
what your intention is you could have
the best intention
it's just going to work out that way and
mostly it has to do with differences
in economic situations and education
levels and stuff like that
but here's what's developing if we
accept
if we accept the proposition that a big
corporation
can make it their business what a
government is doing
oh the government is doing this bad
thing
therefore we as a responsible
corporation
cannot be involved with whatever this
bad thing
is the government is doing they've now
created that
as their situation so now now
a thing that didn't exist in our heads
a year ago is very much in your head
right now isn't it
a year ago if you said to me i think big
corporations will
uh start discontinuing business
in some states in the united states
based on not liking their laws
or that that one of the states is a
little too racist according to them
if you told me that a year ago i would
say that's not going to happen because
corporations just want to make money
they just want to make money that's both
the bad thing about them
and the good thing about them you you
wouldn't want to change that necessarily
right
so and because part of making money is
you have to satisfy the public
so they they can't just make money and
screw the public they have a
you know people are watching so
here's what they accidentally walked
into and i'm going to credit marco rubio
for seeing this and taking advantage of
it so marco rubio watches delta
dumping on georgia and says
well not just delta but coca-cola i
think but
talking about how do you do business in
china
when china is putting the uyghurs in
prison camps
and you don't have any problem with that
i think coca-cola would be the
bigger offender here but think how
clever
that was from marco rubio this is the
most
clever thing i've seen him do as a
politician
and if you don't see it it looks like
it's just one of these
hypocrisy plays right you know hey
you did something bad and then the other
team says
well you did something bad too or you
know
so it your first impression is it's just
a normal hypocrisy claim which have no
effect on anything
but there's something way bigger
happening
like really big and it goes like this
these corporations are making it
acceptable to not do business where the
government
is over the line
they're going to have to pull out of
china and it's their own damn fault
because if the if these companies
continue to press the point
that it would be immoral and therefore
bad for their company bad for the world
to do business with a corrupt government
they're saying that's
georgia not corrupt but racist i guess
they're going to have to decouple
they're going to have to
and they did this to themselves if they
had just
stayed non-political if the
if the poll if the fortune 500 had said
look
we're not in the business of politics
you you
handle the politics we're just in the
free market
we're taking money from anybody who
wants to give us money we're not looking
at their
you know we're not looking at anybody's
a high school
report card to find out if they can buy
a diet coke
we don't care if you went to jail once
you can still buy a diet coke
right that's not our business we're just
about selling stuff
if they'd stayed there they'd be fine
but they didn't stay there
they created a situation where they've
created they've put upon themselves
the expectation that they can't do
business with a
with any entity that's a government
entity that's too evil
they have to decouple now but
it's better than that it's better
i'm only halfway done so not only do
they screw themselves because they're
going to have to lose their
their china business i think the
pressure is going to be too great
it's going to build but here's the other
part
you know we keep talking about
reparations what's the big problem and
you didn't correct
you didn't connect these two topics but
watch me connect them
what's the biggest problem with
reparations
let's say somebody suggested hey let's
do slavery reparations
and they make a good moral argument for
it
number one is there a good moral
argument
for slavery reparations now your your
mileage might vary but i'm going to say
yes
that if you look at our precedence we do
have
a pretty long precedence of saying okay
the government did this to this group
let's say the the japanese americans who
were
put in internment camps right so we do
have precedent
so it fits the precedent and if it's a
moral
i would say if it's a moral um
view of the world but what's the big
problem
the big problem is who are you gonna
where is the money gonna come from
are you gonna tax mate because
you know my family if you trace them
back to new england you'd find they were
anti-slavery
so why am i paying more when my family
didn't own any slaves
and we tried to end it here i'm taking
credit for
you know john adams president and
everything kind of my extended family
um so that's the problem right so the
big problem is who pays
you can't take somebody who's just a an
individual who is completely innocent of
anything that had to do with slavery
and their entire family was and they
didn't get anything
etc now you could argue all white people
benefited by slavery
and i get that argument that's an
argument
it's in the mix it's true right it
passes the sniff test
but it's not really convincing right you
can't you still can't get people like me
to say that it's my responsibility to
pay for somebody else's problem
because it just doesn't feel like it but
the corporations just opened up
the possibility that corporations would
be the source
of that reparations because these
corporations do care about
racial equality before i thought it
wasn't any of their business
they were just selling things and it was
the government's business to make things
fair and keep things equal
and the corporations would simply follow
the rules
that's all they had to do but now the
corporations have gone beyond
following the rules or the laws as
they're set out
and they're trying to change the laws
they're trying to proactively change
something in georgia for example
once a corporation becomes active then
they become part of the solution
potentially
because they're active in it so you
think hey
i hadn't thought about this before but
do you know who
can't complain about paying taxes for
reparations
corporations the only entity in the
united states
who has enough money and can't complain
if they get taxed specifically just them
not
individuals just a corporate tax now i'm
not saying this is a good idea or a bad
idea right
that's a separate argument we'll talk
about whether it's good or bad
i'm not talking about that i'm just
talking about who has the money
and would would they be in a position
where they've created a trap for
themselves
if corporations really really care about
racial equality
and somebody says how are we going to
pay for reparations
will those corporations say we don't
think there should be any
good luck the corporations are going to
have to agree
that reparations are morally
worth doing because that's the position
they've taken
sort of you know in a general sense i
don't think they can avoid it
do you think coca-cola could come out
and say yeah you know we're
we went hard against georgia for you
know what we think of these
jim crow rules but uh
this reparations now we're not going to
pay it we don't think we should pay that
do you think they could do that they
can't
so here's the situation i think uh
corporations have
signed themselves up to pay reparations
because you could never get
individuals to do it you'll you'll never
get
you know the average white person to pay
reparations for something they feel
as if they had nothing to do with it but
you could get corporations to do it
and i'll bet that's where it's going
uh viva frey had a fun tweet today
uh so uh you know uh aaron rupar from
vox he was pointing out that
fox news has ignored the matt gates
story for 48 hours
at the same time cnn has ignored the
latest governor cuomo findings for one
full week
remember when i told you don't start
thinking that
cnn is the only one who does fake news
better a better filter on the world is
that whichever
news organization doesn't have their
person in the presidency
they tend to get a little bit off the
off the leash
right so cnn didn't have a president
when trump was president
they were you know extra bad
they didn't cure themselves when biden
became president but they were extra bad
under trump
everybody would agree with that i think
uh but now fox
i think fox is a little extra bad
because they don't have their
their person in the presidency just as
you'd expect it went exactly the way
you'd expect
somebody says no gates was on tucker but
was that more than 48 hours ago
uh do the timing all right so i don't
you but to your point i can't verify
that either these facts are true
that either cnn ignored cuomo or that
fox ignored gates for that amount of
time
but we're having that conversation and i
think you can see
that you know being news organizations
is the thing of the past let me skip to
something else i was going to talk about
the same topic
you often hear me quoting rasmussen
polls
um if you follow my live stream i'm
often telling you the rasmus and results
and if i tweet about anything from
rasmussen
do you know what happens you know if i
talk to my audience you go okay
rasmus and poll good information there
scott
but if i tweet it and it goes to the
general public
left and right what happens when i tweet
a rasmussen poll
the left universally will say
a rasmussen pole
erasmus ball really
and it happens every time right
like every time you mention erasmus and
poll
some democrat will say
but today there's a survey that came out
uh
showing the polling accuracy on the
presidential race in 2020
rasmussen is in the top right not at the
top but is
in the top cluster so rasmussen one of
the best pollsters in
2020 for the presidential election now
ask yourself
what type of polling entities were
at the bottom in terms of accuracy
who what uh what news entities
just guess just top your head
who do you think would be near the
bottom well i'll give you a few examples
uh quinn pack quinnipiacs right at the
bottom
i feel as though i've seen a lot of
reporting on quinnipiac
mostly from cnn
right but near also second from the
bottom is the
cnn slash ssrs poll
so cnn second from the bottom
so the people who are about the
rasmussen poll
their poll their preferred cnn poll
right at the bottom
also at the bottom abc news slash
washington post
i like that they combine together to do
a poll that
nobody trusts and then also in the
bottom is a siena college new york times
combo so
at least according to this one study
uh rasmussen's uh doing great and the
fake news uh create their own polls
to create their own fake news so the
news business
is no longer happy just looking at what
what is happening in the world
and then you know doing the fake version
of what's happening in the world
your news industries literally
literally have created entirely new
entities to generate fake news
in the form of polls that are inaccurate
this is real nothing i just said right
there is
is an exaggeration
new york times abc washington post
and cnn have all put money and resources
into creating
separate entities or funding them right
separate entities
whose apparent function is to create
fake news in the form of bad polls
that's real that's freaking real
and we're watching it right in front of
all right um i continue to be fascinated
by the
matt gates story fascinated
almost as fascinated by what isn't
happening than what is happening
yeah there's a weirdness to it that just
permeates the whole story
i'll just give you a few things um
number one
i've never seen more smoke for less fire
in any story since russia collusion
have you ever seen more smoke that
turned into
not quite a fire let me give you an
example
here are the things that matt gates is
accused of
uh knowing a guy who did bad things
so this other guy greenberg there's
apparently more
credible evidence against this guy but
gates is really accused of so far i'll
get i'll get to other things right but
so far
one of the the biggest criticisms
against him is
he knows a guy who did bad things now
if we punished all the people in
government
who had spent time with somebody who did
bad things like really bad things
really bad things i'm talking about
really really bad things
who would be left right is that
it's not a crime we don't
i don't recommend that anybody hangs out
with bad people
but you really couldn't use that as any
kind of a standard and it's not a not a
crime
but it's smoke all right so let's talk
about the smoke
there's also evidence we don't know how
credible that there's a video
uh camera showing matt gates and this
other guy greenberg
who had he worked for
the tax collector entity or something
but anyway there was a
apparently they were in an office
greenberg's office and there was a pile
of it looked like i think it was fake
ids
they were in just a box or something and
allegedly
he greenberg and gates were looking
through the fake ids
now let me ask you this if you were
alone with your friend
in front of a big box of fake ids
wouldn't you look through them is there
anybody here
if nobody if nobody else is around right
and there's a big box of fake ideas
are you telling me you wouldn't take a
handful and like see if you could tell
if they're fake and
see what kind of people are doing and
stuff just look at them
i i couldn't keep my hands off them is
that a crime
is it a crime to like rifle through some
fake ideas
because there's no indication that they
then operationalized it and stole them
and used them
there's some indication that the
greenberg guy did
but there's no accusation against skates
that i'm aware of right we're just
talking about what the public knows
what the public doesn't know is a whole
other story now i
i for anybody who's new to my live
streams
it is not my job to defend anybody and
i'm not going to defend him at gates
right he needs to do that himself that's
not my problem
i didn't create any problems i didn't
make his problem i'm not going to solve
this problem right
but i do like to talk about all the
sides of a story
so let's keep doing that the other thing
that we know
is that there's some suggestion that and
i don't know how strong the evidence is
so we only know that there's an
allegation that he may have
had sex with his 17 year old here's what
we don't know
did he know she was 17
that's not an evidence right don't you
think that's sort of
important like really close to the most
important thing in the story is did matt
gates know she was 17. now
part of the story is that he met her
through this website
if she was on the website she almost
certainly you could fact-check this but
she almost certainly had to lie about
her age
to be on the website they're not going
to let an underage person be on that
website
so right
so the point is what is the legal
jeopardy
for someone who didn't know unless they
turned out to be 17.
so i just asked i asked that question on
twitter just before i went live that's
why i was a little bit late
and i want to see if there's any lawyer
who answers the question yet so i'm just
going to look at
the responses they just came in
all right um so i asked
can someone tell me the legal risk and i
i disguised my question because i
thought it'd be funny everybody will
know what what i'm really asking
the way i asked it was this can someone
tell me the legal risk
to a member of congress if
hypothetically
she had sex with a 17 year old boy
who had lied about his age
um
all right i'm looking at your comment
dwayne and thank you for that
all right so uh and then i asked does
not knowing
that somebody is 17 does that make a
difference to the law
now we all know that ignorance is no
defense
but that's a different context ignorance
of whether or not something is illegal
is never a defense but
not even knowing that you're that you're
committing a crime
you know you know that you know
something would be illegal but you don't
even know you're doing it
is that a crime if you don't even know
you're doing it
and so i asked that question because
that's what he's accused of
he's accused of based on what we know
now
all right our current information is if
he had to guess it's more likely he
didn't know
then he knew more likely right it's not
an evidence that he knew
so let's see what people say um
so somebody here who looks like they
know what they're saying
says that a fake id would be a defense
now that doesn't mean he checked an id
but what if
he just asked and she said she's over 17
looked over 17 and he had no indication
to believe that she wasn't
um all right it doesn't look like
enough people are lawyers to actually
answer this question
all right so if there's anybody on here
who's a lawyer
somebody says it's still statutory rape
but let's ask a real world question
if it's if the uh if the subject
involved turned out to be
13 or 14 then i'm with you that's got to
be just probably rape because you would
just assume that anybody would have
known
but at 17 you know are you really going
to find a jury or a judge
who says oh you totally should have
known that she was 17 and a half and not
18
is that even a thing would anybody know
i tried to search it on google of course
but all that comes up is matt gates
stories
and i would have taken hours to find a
real one
uh the local age of consent matters
that's true
oh hold on here we go uh rachel daly
says i'm a lawyer strict liability
statutory rape so you're saying that it
would
that there's strict liability now i
wonder if that has
i'm guessing that that has to do with
the fact that a minor is involved
so so you don't cut any corners when a
miner is involved
but um to
rachel who answered that question thank
you um
what is the real world way that's
handled though
i hear what you're saying and i get that
i think society is better off if we
treat it like it's definitely a crime
even if you didn't know right
because sometimes you have to treat
something like a crime
but then at the same time you kind of
let it go
there are those situations and this
might be one of them where you got to
say it's a crime
but when you're actually judging the
person who was involved you say yeah
you know we understand
all right um so those questions uh
are out there but it's a weird it's a
weird situation because the things that
gates is accused of
are all smoke so far
there's nothing he's accused of that's a
a specific thing
that i would hold him responsible for
now that's not to say they don't exist
right we'll probably find out a lot more
so again i'm not defending him
i'm just pointing out it's all smoke
there's actually no flame here yet that
the public has seen
we've only seen smoke keep that in mind
uh apparently this guy was a capitol
hill attacker for this
latest car attack in which a capitol
hill policeman was killed
is a uh apparently a fan of
louis farrakhan so that of course
matters in our
highly racialized world so he has noah
green
so he was a fair con follower for
whatever that's worth
just put it in your database
a lot of people have asked me since the
pandemic started
scott why don't you tweet alex
berenson stories and why don't you
interview him and
what do you think of alex berenson and
you've probably watched me be somewhat
avoiding that question a little bit
but i have talked about the coronavirus
skeptics
in a general way so he would be one of
the most prominent
skeptics of the let's say scientific
consensus
now he's not a scientist he's a uh
author writer
journalist type um but he's quite famous
now
for doubting a whole bunch of different
elements and data
involved in the pandemic now as i've
said before
skeptics are national treasures you want
you want all the skeptics you can get
right skeptic
skeptics are good and skeptics are good
even if they turn out to be wrong
because if you don't have that that
tension where somebody's doubting things
and somebody has to really really really
prove it
you don't have as good a system so you
want the doubters
the the alex berensons are positive
forces in the world
even if it turned out they weren't right
i just think that's a fair thing to say
it's a good system
to have conflict but it
has been my feelings since the beginning
that
maybe uh his take on things
was not the most productive
and there's an article now by derek
thompson in the atlantic
in which he goes through in some detail
showing what berenson's
said versus what we think we know to be
true
or what the scientists say to be true i
would advise you to read it
i would say there are probably more
skeptics who would agree with
berenson's take on things on this
broadcast
than just about anywhere else in the
world i based on your comments
i know a lot of you are very compatible
with the the skeptical
way of thinking which by the way i
applaud all right
so if you think i'm if you think i'm
making fun of you nope
nope being skeptical about all of this
stuff was exactly the right place to be
you might be wrong you might be wrong
but it was a
it was a good place to be i think you
could be quite reasonably
uh a reasonable citizen could have been
skeptical
all the way through and still even still
anyway but look at that so i'd like you
to see both
uh you know watch berenson's arguments
watch what this one writer derek
thompson anthony atlantic
says about his claims and then judge for
yourself
but uh my general caution is always be
careful of the people who are
branded as skeptics because then they
tend to
they tend to overrun the skepticism a
little bit
like a little too much so that's just a
built into the model unfortunately all
right uh
gordon chang who you know is uh being a
um a vocal china critic
um he reported this is just an anecdotal
report he says a friend tells me
on twitter he said this her friend tells
me that in florida people had been
returning
to a chain store furniture and other
goods after they opened boxes and saw
the products were made in china
and they said i salute them so
i ask you this and i asked this on
twitter as well
have any of you returned an item because
it was made in china
let's say in the last year just the last
one year
has anybody returned an item to a store
after they learned it was made in china
let's see in the comments
and i did a little poll and
i don't believe this is the sort of poll
you shouldn't believe at all
but my own poll on twitter 23
of the people said they have returned an
item just because they found out it was
made in china
now that my audience is not like the
general public
so this would be higher than the general
public but it's still a big number
right 23 of the people who answered
have returned an item you know it
doesn't have to be a hundred percent
before china is in big trouble right
what percent of americans would have to
stop buying chinese products
before china's got a real problem well
it's not 80 it's not 80 it's probably
20 right so
it doesn't take that much to put china
in a bad situation but
there's more oh china's also being bad
kyle bass another china critic says that
uh
china has installed more coal burning
power points and
power plants in 2020 than continental
europe's
entire installed capacity
let me say that again just in 2020
china put into production brand new
more coal burning power plants than the
existing
entirety of all of europe's installed
existing capacity
any questions there's nothing
else to say about that right everything
about that is in that number that's all
you need to know
and uh and uh
kyle bass asked where greta tunberg is
on this
and that's a good question but wait it
gets more fun
today it turns out was a very bad day
for china
very bad day it's because this was the
day that somebody tweeted at me
a website which compiles uh products
made in the united states
so that you can avoid products made in
china
we may have a solution because you're
not going to see it on amazon right
amazon.com can't really label its
products made in china
because if they did they'd have a
problem with their manufacturers in
china and they just couldn't do it
but a private entity can i don't even
know who's behind this
but there exists now and the website is
called chinanever.com
so china never is oneword.com
and then if you're looking for let's say
some furniture
you can start there and you can see all
the brands that are not made in china
and this is why it's a bad day for china
because i just learned this thing exists
i i might be pushing it a little bit for
those of you who are new
i did lose my stepson to a fentanyl
overdose in 2018.
i blame china and if i can destroy
china's government not the people people
are fine
i'd like the chinese people to thrive
but their government
i don't like their government any more
than they do
so expect china to have
some trouble going forward that's what i
say
somebody says most of the chief
furniture is now imported from vietnam
you know i can't think of anything more
than furniture that should be a u.s
industry try to think of any industry
that would be better for let's say the
the harder to employee segment of this
country
the ones who are all they they're fine
for doing physical labor if you teach
them how to do it
learning how to make furniture how to
reupholster
or upholster and stuff like that that
feels like exactly the kind of industry
we want
to absorb the kind of workers who you
know are just perfectly
situated for that and
what reason would we have not to be able
to make it here
i mean we should be making furniture
like crazy here
um somebody says china is laundering
their products through vietnam so it
looks like made in vietnam i'd need to
know more about that but i don't
doubt there's some of that going on
somebody says it's too
labor intensive and that's why you can't
make furniture at this country
here's the thing we can certainly
compete if we use robots to make it
but if we wanted to employ people
i believe that people could make
furniture way faster than they're making
it now
all right and then you also take uh you
have to take away the shipping costs
it's pretty expensive to ship
furniture um
italy too somebody says italy a lot of
furniture i guess
all right yeah north carolina i think
north carolina is the
the major furniture state in the united
states
um
an hour yeah depends on the minimum wage
whether that's uh
economical or not all right it's a weird
weekend
and uh it's just getting weirder
i would love to tell you how weird my
life is right now but you wouldn't even
believe it
you wouldn't even believe it so but
we'll get into that later
all right i don't have much else to say
today because we got a sort of a slow
news weekend
has everybody got some plans for the
holidays
stay safe um
all right we're just looking
well yeah just looking at your comments
somebody says the odds of china going
full capitalist you know what's
interesting
china apparently uh china has the
opinion
that democracies can't last because
we'll be
fighting with each other whereas the
dictatorships or whatever they would
call their own
their own form of government will be the
ones that prevail
because you need a strong leader
as opposed to everybody fighting about
everything from racism to you know what
and on the surface on the surface
it does feel like he's got a point i've
often said that the best form of
government would be a benign
dictatorship
somebody who has the power of a dictator
but they're
empathetic and they're not using it to
hurt anybody they're just making the
best decisions they can
now china doesn't fit into that because
they're you know their dictatorship is
building prison camps and
social credit systems and everything
wrong
but it might make them powerful
there's no question that they're growing
quickly and their power is ascending
uh but what would it take for our
country
to compete what would it take
well i think it's happening it's not
happening fast enough
but part of what what is happening is
that citizens
are taking control where the government
can't
you know i gave you an example yesterday
of uh
yeah a citizen michael mina who had this
idea about rapid testing being better
than
you know the expensive slow testing and
he
pushed it in the social media i helped
boost it
next thing you know he's talking to
congress he's writing articles
and then the fda is approving it now did
that make a difference
would the fda have acted exactly the
same
if a michael mena did not exist and was
not doing such an
amazing job of pushing that one item i
don't know
but i got a feeling that he made a
difference probably a big one
it's hard to know but that's the model
that i think
allows the united states to win
let me give you another example when the
pandemic happened you
you know this example the pandemic
happened um
a number of people including me uh were
approached
by some member of the government you
know not the president but just somebody
in the government was reaching out
and saying literally do you have any
ideas
do you have any ideas of what we should
do now
because there's a lot of stuff that
needs to be done but we're looking for
ideas
because we're you know it's not the
government's job to think up the ideas
that are more in the implementing and so
i had an idea
and i submitted it through my government
contact
and uh i got to watch it in real time
uh it actually got to uh it got to the
chief of staff
of the president i think in hours
i just a few hours later i think or
maybe less it might have been within an
hour
if i remember i think it might have been
within an hour i already had feedback
that my one suggestion which was that
doctors be allowed to practice
telemedicine across state boundaries
that they'd be allowed to do it would
just do an executive order
just make it legal because it's a
pandemic you probably couldn't get away
with it in
ordinary times and the next thing you
know
the president of the united states is
issuing an executive order
and the entire online healthcare
industry
transformed now anybody can be a doctor
across state lines
online and that was just like
one example that was just like one
example
of citizens who became like an
active arm of the government if you know
what i mean so that was a case where i'm
not
elected official but i could do a thing
michael mina is not an elected official
but he could do a thing
gordon chang kyle bass
they are not elected officials but if
you watch them pushing the ball on china
they're really doing a good job like
they're really doing a good job
and of course i help boost their signal
whenever i can
so who's pushing on china is it the
government well the government's
doing its thing marco rubio tom cotton
to name a few
are quite outspoken against china but
they can't do it without us
you know you even even in the government
they need some strong voices your go
your gordon changs and your kyle basses
and such
to to lend some weight to any of that
so i think we're at a point where there
are individuals in the public eye
who are almost like uh
unelected unpaid
what would you call them accessories
that sounds like accessory to a crime
um boosters
participants it's almost like you need
another name for it
because the the citizens are taking on
government functions
usually just persuasion but in the case
of let's take the case of this
china never website i assume that's a
non-government entity
just citizens who said if this if this
website exists
it's good for the country so the number
of times that you see this and it's only
possible because of the internet right
if you take the internet away there's no
gordon chang there's no kyle bass
there's no me there's no michael mina
right
so you need the internet and social
platforms
but in effect it weaponizes the public
so that the
um usually the stronger voices i like to
think
the stronger voices rise up the
government can't ignore them
they become you know part of the
solution and i would argue that if
china is looking at our government in
isolation
it's a hot mess so if you just said
how's the government of the united
states you'd be looking at congress
right and the president
and you look at congress and you say
well that's a mess there's no way
this piece of congress is going to
compete with china
watch us make a decision boop there
watch us make another one how about that
well you know well our congress is still
arguing about who's the biggest racist
what they don't see is that our
government
is not isolated to the people in that
building
our government is you that's different
so china has has a system in which the
government is maybe the elites and the
people in the party but our government
is anybody who's got a better idea
it's true what did michael amina have
a better idea so simply having a better
idea
made him our government for all
practical purposes
he he had as much influence on this
decision that you know
thing he knew about the most he uh he
had as much influence probably as
anybody in the government and it's only
because he had the ability
so the weird thing about our system is
that we do let people who have unusual
ability
do their thing now i would say that
greta tunberg
like her like her hater she's a perfect
example this
greta is an unelected official
not american obviously but in her in her
own country
democracy democratic system and
she was allowed to rise up because she
had the capability to do this thing
so i think that's what china gets wrong
china might be right
that our elected officials are kind of
pathetic sometimes
you know collectively not as individuals
but you know when you put them together
they become pathetic
but they underestimate elon musk
am i right if you're looking at the
government of the united states
and you don't include elon musk
you're missing you're missing the story
because
elon musk here i'm sort of going too far
and
reading his mind right so i shouldn't do
that but just for the point
for the purpose of rounding out my point
if nasa if you if a government funded
nasa couldn't get us to mars
and couldn't get us to the point where
we can dominate space
we're in big trouble if china does
so you've got an elon musk who just you
know i'm oversimplifying a complicated
thing
but you have an elon musk who just says
i can get you to space
why don't i do it the government can't
get you there or can't get you there
right or can't get you there
economically or something
so i guess i'm the government now
so if you would say that elon musk is
not
part of the governing structure of the
united states you're wrong
he is he's just not elected and
he's he's leading based on competence
we do have a country where if you ex you
exhibit extreme
competence the country will get out of
your way
they'll just get out of your way because
we do like competence
like as a country we we almost
worship capability like
individuals who can do stuff now this is
my big
complaint with many of you
my big complaint with many of you is
that you don't appreciate
bill gates as much as i do
now is bill gates right about everything
no
is anybody no but uh
but if you had to have a contest of pic
anybody else in the world
politicians scientists anybody you want
and just put them in the same room with
bill gates and figure out which one of
them is right more often
i'm gonna vote for bill gates every time
right he's right about a lot
and he has tremendous capability so he
takes his
gates foundation he's aiming at the
world more than the country
but doing plenty for the country so if
the people who say bill gates uh is an
awful person
you really have to check that assumption
i you know i know that i can be wrong
about stuff you've
you've seen it right you've all seen me
be wrong about stuff
so i'm not right about everything but if
i'm i am so positive
and so confident of the following
opinion that i would be amazed if i'm
wrong about this and it goes like this
bill gates has the right intentions the
right skill set
and he's working for you he's working
for you
he doesn't need much for himself he's
kind of working for you
with the greatest capability and brain
and good intentions maybe we've ever
seen in
our lifetime that's my opinion right so
all the rumors about putting chips and
and your vaccinations and
uh wanting to blot out the sun and all
that those are all out of context
pretty much everything you think badly
about bill gates is just out of context
if you knew the whole story you wouldn't
be bothered by it at all
that's my opinion anyway so as long as
we've got
your your musks your gates your
kyle basses your gordon chang's your
michael minas
and i like i like to do what i can in
the same realm as long as you've got
these people as part of your not quite
government
but sort of china
you better be worried you better be
worried
because that's pretty good package all
right
why is bill gates buying up land i could
think of lots of reasons
one of the reasons that a bill gates
would be buying up land is that he's
buying up everything
when you have a when you reach a certain
amount of wealth
you just have to start shooting it in
every direction to get diverse
diversification and stuff so it could be
that if you have so much money you just
run out of things to buy you know and so
you think well
land always works i'll buy a bunch of
farmland how could that go wrong
now it could also be that he's buying it
to protect it
could be that he's buying it to make it
available to low-income people
someday when he dies who knows we don't
know why he's doing it but
i would definitely not uh i would
definitely not worry about it
so one thing i wouldn't do is worry
about it it's the last thing i'd worry
about
in fact the more farmland that bill
gates owns
the safer you are because china doesn't
own it and
somebody bad doesn't own it so if you
could give
all of the farmland to bill gates you'd
be safer
i'm not suggesting that i'm just saying
as a to make the point
that's how much i trust bill gates now i
could be wrong
but and by the way he would be on my
very near the top of my list of somebody
i would interview
to help him get his version out one of
the things i also appreciate about bill
gates is that he never defends himself
think about that the same thing i liked
about richard gere
when that was it a gerbil rumor came out
he never
he never defended it and i'm gonna take
that model
so should in the future should you see
me uh
get accused of some heinous thing i'm
telling you now
i probably won't defend it if it's funny
so if i get accused of something that's
funny
like a durable or something i'm not
going to defend it because
it's just funnier to keep it out there
in fact there's something like that
happening right now
some of you already know it and you've
watched me not defend it
and it's only because it's funny all
right
uh somebody says all right
this is a good point um
so tyrone says and this is a reasonable
thing to ask
he says yeah anybody else think it's a
good idea
to have one guy who owns all the
farmland if he fails we all starve
great idea scott that's not how the
world works
if one guy owned all the farmland and he
wasn't using it productively we'd just
take it away from them
don't worry about it if if the
government looked around and said hey
wait a minute
one guy bought all the farmland and he
stopped growing food
it would take 10 minutes and they'd say
well you'd better grow some food
or we're going to take it away from you
you don't really have to worry about
that that's the sort of thing that
uh first of all it wouldn't happen
that he would buy all the farmland as
stop producing food all right that's not
gonna happen
but even if it did we would just fix it
in five minutes we'd just say well we
can't have that
and we just fix it
bill gates doesn't have more power than
the government
yet
what if he makes gmo food you know i'm
not really in that
debate i haven't followed it too much
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow
