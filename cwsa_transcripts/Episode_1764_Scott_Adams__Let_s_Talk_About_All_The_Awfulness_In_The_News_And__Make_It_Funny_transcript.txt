good morning everybody
and welcome to coffee with scott adams
now you may have seen that there's a
yeti yet again another study
saying that people who drink coffee
regularly
have longer lifespans
that's true
and on top of that
there's another study it's a preprint
preprint so it has not been peer
reviewed
but
it's looking good
and it says that no one has ever died
while watching coffee with scott adams
zero
that's right
and nobody has ever had anything less
than a peaky experience while listening
to
the simultaneous poor participating and
all you need is a copper marker glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the thing that will extend your
lifespan
guaranteed it's called science
and
your favorite beverage will be fine too
it's called disabled ladies up do it now
go
so good
well let me tell you the story that's on
my screen so i can turn it off and have
it stop shining at me
so as you may or may not know
who are way smarter than i am say that
nbc news
is usually the organ that the cia uses
to get its message out
have you ever heard that no i don't know
if it's
if it's true or how true it is but it
looks true
yeah if you look at the way they cover
the news
the things they've done in the past and
the people who were talking about them
it looks true
i mean i can't verify that sort of thing
personally
but today there's a story
that is just
jaw-droppingly
um
jaw-dropping other i don't know what
else to say about it i'll just tell you
the story and i'm not even sure i can
add any commentary for it just know that
it comes from nbc
and that one of the writers here
ken
delanian
i think he is sometimes named as
you know what are the people in this
context
all right
so there's a story here that the biden
administration
uh in a break with the past
right here's the nbc news report in a
break with the past us is using intel to
fight an info war with russia
even when the intel isn't rock solid
now do you know what they mean when they
say even when the intel isn't rock solid
it means literally making it up
so here there's a story in nbc
that's putting a positive spin
on the fact that the u.s
government
is lying
lying
intentionally and for a fact
about uh what russia's intentions are
and the example they use is that the
united states cleverly said that russia
was planning to use
chemical warfare
apparently there was no indication of
that whatsoever
but the united states cleverly says nbc
put out that story to maybe keep russia
from using chemical warfare
to which i say
i don't think that's what happened
i don't think that's what happened at
all
to me it just looks like we lied about
russia
so that
you know we could get more funding or
support ukraine or
support the narrative
i don't really see that as a clever
preemptive cia lie to prevent putin from
using chemical weapons
because if that's all it took
well that's all it takes
you just got to say it first
oh
i hadn't thought of that
yeah that that clever
military strategy of saying it first
you know let's try that with nuclear
weapons
i'm going to try it now
coming up with a lie
okay i got it
putin
is going to launch nuclear weapons at
the united states for no reason
whatsoever
now
it's not true it's not true there's no
indication of that
but
i may have just prevented him from doing
it
because until recently i didn't know
that lying about ridiculous in
public was exactly the same as a
military defense
we actually stopped a chemical attack in
ukraine
by lying about it first
now
am i right when i told you
that there's almost nothing you could
add to this story that isn't more
outrageous than the story itself just by
itself
there's nothing i keep trying to like
exaggerate it to make it more wild
but it's really
hard to exaggerate the fact
that nbc news
commonly believed to be an organ of the
cia
is telling us that lying to you is good
for you because it kept you safe
am i really reading that
i mean i don't what do you say
this is
first of all it's good
you know it in terms of
um am i happy that the cia is capable
enough to do something this wildly
effective right in your face to which i
say i guess i am happy about that
i mean allegedly they're on our side
right
you wouldn't want the cia to be bad at
his job
would you
if they're you know mostly on your side
so
i don't know i have mixed feelings about
this clearly they're manipulating you
know world opinion and they're telling
you right to your face
but the fact that it's so bold
kind of makes it acceptable
which i assume is exactly what they're
trying to do they're
they're making an awful thing
sound like hey not only is this not
awful it's pretty good
you should want more of it
in fact we're going to lie about more of
our
potential military enemies
because the more we lie about them
the less likely they'll do bad things
they're actually selling it
believe it or not
all right well on a different topic
there's a company that came up with a
chainless bicycle
49 percent less
friction sounds like a big deal doesn't
it they've got some kind of clever gear
situation with ceramic years
that they get rid of the whole chain
assembly
and reduce the friction by
49 percent
now one of the reasons that i love
having a lot of followers or engineers
do you know how long it took somebody to
debunk that claim
[Laughter]
if you have
if you have like tens of thousands of
engineers who follow your account
like i do you can't get away with
anything
so here's what they said uh scott the 49
less friction
applies to just the chain assembly part
which is about three percent of the
total friction
so
you could reduce that by 49 and not even
notice the difference
to which i say i don't know if that's
true but it's a good comment
i i love having engineers
you
trust me
if you don't have any engineers in your
life
just as sort of bystanders
you know just sort of witnesses to your
life you need to get some
you know they say that drinking coffee
is uh correlated with longevity
i will bet you i'll make you a bet on
this i'll bet you that you could do a
study i would i would bet a lot on this
that the more engineers you know
personally
the longer you'll live
and the more money you'll make
and the healthier you'll be
would anybody take that bet
because
it it has to make a difference
that there's somebody anywhere in your
circle
who will call you out for being
irrational
and engineers will always do that
because they can't help it
you know engineers don't even know how
to be quiet
if somebody's being completely
irrational or dangerous or stupid
[Music]
how does an engineer not mention it
it comes up it comes up
right
so
make friends with an engineer as many as
you can
um
i tried to watch the documentary
uh what is a woman
and correct me if i'm wrong
but i can only watch that if i subscribe
do a monthly subscription to the daily
wire
is that correct
can somebody
i'm saying yes okay
yeah unfortunately i'm not going to be
able to watch it then
because i don't want i'm not going to
watch it illegally
because i have a
obviously i have a thing about that
but
i have this
i just have this rule
that uh
oh you cancel other work streaming
services in exchange
yeah i have a rule that i'm not gonna
buy something for the wrong reason like
i would pay cash for it
you know if if the if the price were 25
i actually do believe i can get 25 worth
of entertainment value out of it just
based on the trailer based on the fact
people are talking about it etc
but i
i've talked about simplification versus
optimization
the way to optimize this situation is
sign up for a subscription
watch the film then decide if you want
to keep the subscription
and then monitor it and cancel as soon
as possible if you decide you don't want
it and if you do want it well you win
twice
i'm not going to do that
i didn't sign up for homework
i i didn't sign up to go on an adventure
i just wanted to see the
i just wanted to see the documentary now
part of the reason that
it's
annoying to me as a consumer but also a
brilliant business move is that so many
people will want to see it they will
sign up and they'll keep their
subscriptions and as a marketing device
is pretty ingenious
but
i i feel like i wish i'd known it was a
marketing device
because when i thought it was a
documentary in the ways that i imagined
that you know you could just stream it
or buy it or something when i thought it
was just a documentary like i was all
over it i wanted to watch it
but i don't no i'm not going to ask for
yet
there's a lot of advice i get
that you
[Music]
uh how do i say this
there's a lot of
advice about what i could do because of
my you know dilberty powers or whatever
but it's not really good advice
to be using it
being annoying to other people
just because i can
it's just now something i want to
include in my repertoire one of the
things that you can do when you're
famous is you can meet other famous
people
you know somebody was saying this i
think jordan peterson said this recently
on some video i saw
that uh one of the
one of the super powers is you can call
anybody
if jordan peterson rings you up
you'll take the call
right and he was saying that
and
while i have you know smaller
smaller superpowers of that nature
i wouldn't use it
i mean i'd have to have some life and
death reason
uh
you know it's not a license to be
annoying
anyway um
have you seen the controversy about
david uh i don't know how to pronounce
his last name weegle
or is it weigel
somebody will help me out there
who writes on politics for the
washington post and he he
he retweeted
a uh offensive tweet
an offensive tweet
i'm gonna read you the offensive tweet
but i'm gonna tell you how i
it so deeply
and that's how i can not be banned from
social media
because i disavow this it's okay to
apparently the people who were tweeting
it in context
were fine but if you tweeted it you know
as a native joke
not so good
so when i show it to you just know that
the context is
not that i think is hilarious
no no
no
and if i
appear to be laughing even when i read
it to you
don't be fooled by that
i i am disavowing the hell out of this
thing
hard
hard disavowal okay
are you ready
this is the sick and demented
tweet
that david wiegel or possibly weigel
uh tweeted and got in trouble and had to
apologize for it
and he didn't write the tweet he just
retweeted it
and that tweet that offensive terrible
tweet said the following quote
every girl is bi
you just have to figure out if it's
polar or sexual
disgusting
um
first of all it is not true that every
girl is bi and that you just have to
figure out if it's
bipolar or bisexual
that's not true
that is not technically true
but
he eventually
uh david
eventually had to issue
an apology and he was he was sorry he
was sorry if he offended anybody
oh
no
no
no no no
all right here's a little rule that i
think we should all
embrace
we won't
but we should
if something is offensive
but it sounds like
you know maybe somebody really means it
to be offensive
well then maybe we should do something
about that i don't want to live in a
world where
people can insult you and hurt you with
words without some pushback
might be words but some pushback
but i think we should take this as a
standard
that if the
so-called offense
is absurdist
meaning that no reasonable person could
take it literally
you gotta you gotta be okay with those
yet you have to learn
i think you have to learn that if you're
so far over the line of being
close to reality
that nobody should take that seriously
let me give you an example
to show you i can turn it around on
myself
a long time ago i had a
follower on my live streams who is a
she described herself anyway as a
african-american woman and a pastor
and she interacted with me a lot and she
was a lot of fun
and at one point she said something
about
white stereotypes and i
you know asked her what would be an
example of a white person stereotype and
i didn't really know what i was going to
get
and
her answer was
that white people like cheese and i
laughed for about
three hours
i laughed for about three hours
because
here's what makes something funny
something that feels true but isn't
that's the simplest definition of humor
all right and by the way you just
learned something that that's really
powerful
the simplest definition of humor if
you're trying if you're trying to figure
out what is funny or how to make a joke
something that feels like it's true
but you know it isn't true
right
so
uh when when you see the joke
well first of all if somebody says that
you know white people like cheese
that it just feels true because i've
been with so many groups of
of you know
people
of all types and i'm pretty sure all
white people are eating cheese
i feel like
if you're white you eat cheese almost
all the time and i never thought about
it but the moment that i thought about
it it was hilarious to me
because
if i think of all the
every encounter i've ever had
with anybody black
like none of my memories involve them
eating cheese
now that doesn't mean they don't eat
cheese
in fact if you did a study i don't know
if there'd be any difference at all
i've no i have no idea if there'd be any
difference in cheese eating among
ethnicities no idea
but the fact that it struck me as true
because just just my you know
selective observation about the world
was hilarious to me because i never
thought about it now in the same way
that i am not offended by somebody
saying that
white people like cheese is just
absurdist
and sort of sounds true but isn't true
so it's funny
when i see that every girl is bi you
just have to figure out if it's bipolar
or bisexual clearly he doesn't mean that
to be literally true
and but there's something about it
that at least to men
sorry
at least to men
sounds
sounds true well we know it's not
actually true
right
so that's the perfect joke
it feels true but you know it isn't
it's absurdist
so you got to be able to let that one go
uh i guess i can see humor being you
know not funny and just cruel
and maybe those deserve apologies or not
you could have that argument
but if it's absurdist i know
so here's what i recommend as a standard
and i would like to tell you here's sort
of an insider
thing so you can say you heard it here
if i am ever forced to apologize
for something i retweeted
and you see me apologize
just know
that my apology
is part of the joke
you got that
because it's going to sound
a little bit too sincere
i'm going to tweak it 10 percent
if i tweak it 20 percent people are
going to say wait a minute that's not a
sincere apology i think he's just
yanking our chain so i'm not going to
tweak it 20
i'm going to
dial it back
it's going to be a 110 apology
so that you know
i'm just with you
[Laughter]
so if i ever have to give that apology
just know
just between us
the apology is part of the joke
all right
so that uh amber heard and johnny depp
trial is rocking civilization in so many
ways here's what we should have learned
and i thought we would
i thought we were going to learn about
defamation laws
and who who can lie about somebody in
what way
and i thought that would be good for the
public to know right
wouldn't you like to know more about
that like who can sue for what and what
would it take to win defamation
so i thought we'd learn a lot about that
from that trial um i thought we'd people
people who have not been
subjected to the uh let's say the
addiction lifestyle
might have learned something about the
depth
of addiction
and how bad that is you know listening
to
uh johnny depp's story
and then i thought the most important
part was that we heard you know experts
talk about this so-called cluster b
personality disorders
that allegedly amber heard was part of
according to at least one psychiatrist
and i thought wow
if if the public learned all of that
that would be a lot
imagine how much better off we'd be if
we understood what what kind of lies you
cannot get away with or should not get
away with
imagine if
um
people were more critical about what
they hear about accusations of other
people
and more understanding that things in
the headlines can be completely made up
so i would say that that would have been
a good lesson
and
knowing about addiction
that would be good and knowing about
these cluster b things but the media has
turned this into a story about men
versus women
what
do you know what the amber heard and
johnny depp trial was not about
the the thing it was least about was men
versus women that's what it was least
about
and somehow the media just turned it
into that because that's the cash cow
it's got to be men versus women yeah put
it there and here's why i say it wasn't
because you could have reversed the
story
and
and just run through the same way you
could reverse who said what about who
and just it would have turned out about
the same wouldn't it
because
it was about an addict
who is in a
dysfunctional relationship with somebody
who according to experts
had cluster b personality disorder so
you should have been learning about an
addict and a cluster b personality
disorder and if you put them together
what are you going to get
the fact that that turns into man versus
woman
what
their genders have nothing to do with it
you have to actually like reach
to find it even in terms of the
physicality
and even in terms of who was able to
hurt who
the most
that wasn't even male versus female
because i don't think anybody was saying
that amber heard was the you know the
one who was afraid of johnny depp they
were probably afraid of each other at
some points
but it didn't feel like there was like a
physicality thing
you know at one point it was a power
related thing because he hired her and
she was younger and he was older and he
was
but but it wasn't really that
by the time i got to this trial i mean
that that was history by then
so somehow we we managed to avoid the
important lessons here that there are
people
uh with these cluster b personality
disorders
and if you run into one you're gonna get
this
the cluster b personality disorder
they're destroyers they destroy
everybody and everything they touch
including themselves
so if you didn't learn that
you learned absolutely the wrong thing
if you learned this was about i was
reading today there was that this is the
uh
pushback to the me to two movement
to which i say no it wasn't
no wasn't at all
it was about these two very specific
people who had very specific personality
characteristics
one was addicted
the other was allegedly a cluster b
personality disorder
that's what the story is the gender
stuff's a misdirection
so i told you my county alone among over
3 000 counties in the united states
decided to
reinstitute indoor mask mandates
yesterday
the good news is
the locals uh a lot of them were just
ignoring it
so i'm not sure if the word hasn't
gotten around
but there's a lot of ignoring it i've
heard so i'm not directly
witnessing it yet but
we'll see
here's an update on long covered
personal experience
so a week ago i had my first symptoms
and you know first few days were rugged
of
omnicron i guess omicron
and
then i thought by the third day oh i'm
fine
fourth day i actually felt better than
normal
because it was like a bounce back i
guess i didn't feel bad anymore so i
felt good
but
let me tell you
i don't know if the exhaustion is
because of this or something else
but i've never dealt with anything like
this
the fatigue part
and here's here's what i'm going to add
to this
describing that as exhaustion or fatigue
are misleading
and i have a suspicion
that it's a dopamine shortage
here's why
i told you in a prior live stream a
while ago
that i learned that dopamine
is associated with two things
one is your mood you know how happy you
are how good you feel now that's the
part you knew
lots of dopamine you feel good
what i didn't know and i learned more
recently is that dopamine is attached to
your movement
and if you don't have the right dopamine
levels your movement is off
so
parkinson's
is a shortage of dopamine
so you get the shakes
to fix it they add some fake dopamine
and they'll
doper or whatever it is uh to compensate
that
so there's this connection between your
mood
and your movement
they're inseparable
your mood
and your ability to move are inseparable
and when you first think about that you
think to yourself well that's very
inefficient like why do they even why
are they even connected
and then you think about it
why do you do anything
because you think it'll pay off
that's it that's why you do anything
the reason you stand up the reason you
walk into the next room the reason you
turn on the light when you walk into a
dark room
everything you do
is because you think there'll be a
payoff
and payoff the currency of payoff is
dopamine
that's like the internal cryptocurrency
in your brain it's like oh do this thing
here's your payoff here's your payoff
here's your payoff
but what happens when the payoff uh like
the the blockchain for your payoffs
disappears for a while
because let me describe
what the fatigue feels like to me
because i was experiencing it yesterday
like a mofo
and what it feels like is like nothing
i've ever experienced
you know what it's like to be tired and
you know what it's like to be fatigued
normally right if you're actually just
physically exhausted
but let me ask you this
even when you're really really tired
like really tired
you can still get up and do something
you want can't you
like it you wouldn't want to get up and
get yourself a cold glass of water
but if you were thirsty
you could be just exhausted and you'd
still be all right
because would be a payoff you get a
little dopamine hit
what it feels like when you have this
covered long covered thing
you feel like your dopamine is gone
i don't know if that's what's happening
but i'll tell you on the inside it feels
like the reason to move left
that's different
that doesn't feel like just being
exhausted
my my arms and legs would would be like
just dead weights
but the brain part that says do it
anyway
was turned off
it was just turned off
i could not connect needing to do
something that my brain would say all
right you obviously need to do this
you need to eat this food or walk in
this next room or feed the dog you just
need to do this
and
the need to do it was disconnected from
my body
the
and i think the dopamine
feedback connection was just gone
and you know how sometimes you feel just
empty
that emptiness
feels to me
like the dopamine
block is broke like i can't get any
reward for anything
so
i immediately googled dopamine and
covid and of course
there are articles suggesting there's a
some kind of connection now it might be
serotonin you know i might have my my
chemistry wrong
but we're talking about happy chemicals
versus less happy and i think the
dopamine specifically is the movement
one
so
so
here's what's interesting
uh
i upgraded my cannabis last night
because i i got a bad batch that was
really nasty
it was a bad batch that was too strong
it was like just banging yourself with a
hammer
uh so i got something that would do
nothing but
boost my dopamine
what happened as soon as i boosted my
dopamine
my physical body
was willing to move
so it didn't give me i didn't feel like
it gave me energy
i feel like it connected the blockchain
and now my dopamine rewards were
connected to my movement even for the
smallest stuff
like it feels good just to stand up
just walk outside
and
yeah i did i did start drumming actually
so
somebody says my parkinson's was
impacted by covent
which way
which way was it impacted
worsened right because if you had
parkinson's and then you got coveted
you'd be you know doubly hit on your
dopamine maybe i know
all right enough about me
uh what would you get if uh if oprah
and donald trump had a baby
here's a quiz if oprah
and trump had a baby
so he says candace owens all right
that's funny
uh that was that's not where i was going
l sharpton somebody said
uh no dr oz
dr oz
all right if you follow politics that's
funnier
yeah because oprah was sort of kicked
off dr oz's career on tv and trump
probably is the reason that dr oz won
his primary
so
so dr oz is the the weirdest duck of all
ducks
as he's the love child of oprah and
trump in in a weird way
well they say the experts say summer
travel will be a nightmare
i have to admit
that when i thought about traveling this
summer
i thought to myself i think that would
be a nightmare
i don't know how i'd be willing to do it
it seems like just getting somewhere
would be nearly impossible and who knows
if there's going to be more mass
mandates everywhere who knows
but
uh has anybody canceled travel either
because of
gas yeah gas prices
how many of you have canceled travel
for the summer
or we're cut back
oh wow i'm saying
i'm seeing a lot of yeses
all right a lot a lot of no's too
wow
well if those numbers are true
maybe we won't have the problem we think
because there's a self
self correcting
thing going on here
i remember when uh
when the pope was visiting san francisco
a million years ago
and the advice was do not drive a car
into san francisco that day because the
pope will be here it will be a mass
just crazy time whatever you do
do not get in the car and come to san
francisco on that day
turns out i had to get in the car and go
to san francisco that day
i was the only one on the road
it was the easiest travel i've ever had
to san francisco because everybody
thought it was serious
so everybody left their car home the
streets were empty it was like the
easiest i've ever driven in the city
maybe
enough people will cancel their travel
because of the high gas prices and
everything else
that uh
it won't be that hard but i don't know
could go either way it's dicey
chris hayes
from msnbc
had this tweet um talking about the the
right to shoot an intruder in your home
and he he says just play out what that
means so it's part of a larger thread so
if it feels like it's out of context
i would invite you to see his larger
thread
uh
he says just play out what that means
uh so he's talking about for the second
amendment being used to protect people
from the government
right so one of the arguments for the
second amendment is it protects the
citizens from their own government
so in that context chris says chris
hayes says
just play out what that means you have
the right to shoot an intruder to your
home
and you have the right to
dot dot put a bullet in the head of
someone from the government who is doing
things that are quote overly intrusive
so he's saying that if it's okay to
choose somebody who's being overly
intrusive in your home
would that apply to the government
to which i said i replied the implied
threat of violence both ways is the
operating system that keeps america free
there is an implied threat of violence
not only from the government to its
citizens but from the citizens to his
government and if you took away either
of those the system would fall apart
so chris hayes
yes yes you do want your government to
think
that there's some line i don't know what
that line is but you do want your
government to think there's a line
if you cross this line
all bets are off
and if you don't think that keeps the
whole country together
you're you're overlooking the value of
violence
whereas i think jordan peterson says it
better you know the implied threat of
violence the implied threat of male
violence is usually the context he's
talking about
so yeah
that's not a situation i would run away
from
in an im imperfect world we'll talk
about navarro
um
bill maher on on his show
i guess last night
he was worried about the uh the
republicans stealing the pot
legalization issue
he's talking to
eric holder i guess
and what do you think of that are you
worried not worried but do you think the
republicans will try to steal the pot
legalization issue because i guess when
the democrats passed it in the house
they put a bunch of equity things in
there you know like advantages for
african-american
sellers i guess
uh growers or sellers
and the republicans said no to that
because it was too much about the equity
according to bill maher's
characterization of it
so what do you think do you think that
the republicans
would take the free money that's sitting
on the table and just pick it up and say
oh i'll take this free money we'll
decriminalize this and
nope
no no i don't think that the republicans
have that capability
so
sorry
it would be smart to do
and it would work
but now the republicans are not
competent enough to do that
i hate to say it
but they're not that
am i wrong
it's not really about
what they believe or what they think is
right or who's going to be injured by
it's not it's nothing to do with that i
think the republicans simply don't have
the competence to do it
now i think that republicans have better
opinions on some topics so this isn't
anti-republican rhetoric here
but on this one topic they're not
competent
they're just not capable because this
literally is just a pile of free money
sitting on a table
if you can't lean over and scoop scoop a
gigantic pile of free money into your
bag
it's like there's a sign on it says
here's some free money free money it's
just this big pile of money
there's no downside just just scoop it
into your into your bag just scoop it in
that's all you have to do
and the republicans are not capable of
doing that
but unfortunately
i don't think it matters but
let me bang one more republican here and
lose half of my audience
let's see if you can hang in here with
me on this okay
let me compliment you first
many of you
you've heard this before right a number
of people who are not naturally
republicans
um got support from republicans
you know joe rogan for example
uh elon musk you know people you don't
think of as maybe naturally republican
in any way
but they got so much support from
republicans
because the
republicans support free speech
you know among other things
free enterprise too
so that's what draws me to this audience
as well
is that
uh i've sort of you know developed an
audience of people who are forgiving
things i would like to be forgiven for
which is having a different opinion than
you
so it's one of the few places that you
can i actually feel like i can disagree
with people it's okay
it's with republicans conservatives
let's say conservatives yeah i like that
framing better we'll say conservatives
conservatives are much more likely
to be okay with the difference of
opinion if
but there's a big if what's the big if
what's the one thing you have to do
maybe two
in order for a conservative to say all
right i'm not gonna hate you for that
opinion
mutual respect
exactly
mutual respect
that's number one
right
but the other thing is that show your
work
how about that
how about you show your work
you know i show my assumptions
and they might be different than yours
for example
if you've got an opinion that starts
with
you know the bible tells me to do acts
i'm i don't have that same belief
so we might get to a different point
but i have complete respect for anybody
who lives a let's say a religion
informed lifestyle
because it works
you don't need a better argument than
that
somebody chooses a lifestyle that
clearly statistically works i'm not
going to mock that i'm going to say good
work you know you did a good job of
picking something that works for you if
it worked for me i'd pick it too
because it works it just doesn't work
for me
so with that in mind and with your
indulgence
uh there's a report that ron desantis
blocked state funding for the tampa bay
rays training facility
because they had tweeted something he
didn't like about
gun control
now his public reason
was that he doesn't want the state to
fund sports teams training facilities
which i think is actually a pretty
strong reason
and if that's the only reason oh that's
fine
i'm not even sure i'd agree or disagree
with it but if his reason is the
government should not be in that
business
whenever whenever conservatives say that
it doesn't even matter what the topic is
when a conservative says the government
shouldn't be in that business i
automatically respect that opinion
just automatically
doesn't mean i'm going to agree with it
because it might be an exception i'm
more likely to to
tolerate an exception than some of you
are
but i even understand why you wouldn't
tolerate them
even that's a good argument
so
here's my problem with desantis
uh i like the conservatives who are in
favor of free speech
i like the conservatives who are in
favor of free speech because that's also
the umbrella with which
you accept me
right
and
while i get the argument and i respect
it
i get the argument that if conservatives
push back against you know the corporate
entities it'll take the corporations out
of the conversation
and maybe you want that maybe you don't
want corporations
to be influencing these things maybe it
should just be people in their
government and not the
corporations maybe
i mean i disagree with that
because i think corporations are just
another example of free speech but i
would respect
respect the opinion that you got to
fight back and maintain your rights and
stuff i get it
but i'm going to go
that
i don't know how i could support a
somebody running for president who
who did something that's anti-free
speech
that's sort of
disqualifying can you imagine trump
doing something that was anti-free
speech
you can definitely imagine trump
punishing people for not supporting him
right
he's got a history of that
but would he would he punish somebody
just for
anti-free speech
or or for expressing their opinions that
way would he
i don't know
i wouldn't like it if he did
but i feel like he wouldn't
well i feel like this is a rare desantis
error
and the reason i talk about desantis so
much is because he is so error-free and
his
his pitch perfect at least satisfying
his base
pitch perfect
and maybe this does let me ask you i'll
put it to you
um
do you agree with desantis pushing back
on the tampa bay rays
do you agree with desantis
yes or no
do you agree with desantis
looking at your comments
i see lots of agreements but i see some
disagreements
somebody said if he's not honest about
it yeah okay
okay
so let me let me throw that in the mix
suppose you knew he was lying about his
reason
would you be okay with it then
if you knew he was lying we don't know
that by the way that's just somebody's
allegation we don't know that
and by the way if his public reason
is actually real
i'm fine with that
if the public reason
he just doesn't want to waste money on
sports teams
sure
i'm okay
ah i just got my questions there
rasmussen reports did a poll on people
who watched two thousand mules
the uh
documentary that alleges to show these
these people stuffing ballot boxes
and
of those who have seen it
um the question was did the film
strengthen or weaken your conviction
that there was systemic and widespread
election fraud in the 2020 election
so 68 of democrats
who watched it were strengthened in
their belief that there was fraud in
that election
and of course gop 85 blah blah so even
independent 77
and somebody asked who are these
democrats who would watch that movie
how many democrats
at all would watch that movie
how do you even poll this
i'm not even sure if they really watched
the movie maybe they just said they did
anyway
um
i the way i read this poll is if you're
a democrat and you watch that movie at
all you are already open to being
persuaded
am i right
if you've
if you were a democrat who would watch
an entire documentary against your own
team
you are already open to being persuaded
so it doesn't really tell you anything
that it's persuasive the way you should
read this is
documentaries are persuasive
that's all
and i've told you that before the reason
you shouldn't believe a documentary is
because it's designed to be believed
it's not designed to be right
big difference
a documentary is designed to be believed
not designed to be accurate
all right um
peter navarro was arrested on getting on
a flight yesterday i guess
he was handcuffed he was put in leg
shackles
and taken in for uh i guess his crime is
um
contempt of congress for not agreeing to
go cooperate to the with their january 6
committee
now he has his reasons
why he's not cooperating
and he doesn't think that the committee
is
legitimately formed and staffed and
therefore has no authority over him
and he had apparently he knows
personally you know some of the fbi
people and he's basically said hey if
you want me to come in just let me know
they still dragged him off an airplane
in public in in chains
now do you think they did that to
sussman
did sussman have shackles did he get did
he get arrested in public
and
um so i saw peter navarro talking about
it after he got released probably on
bail i guess
and
um
did you see this
can you tell me
can you tell me how this made you feel
because i
i felt something
and i didn't like it at all
what happened to roger stone
i said to myself well this is a travesty
but it might also be a one-off
it's not one-off
apparently there's just a different
standard for how the trump supporters
are being treated
this is so clear now
and i mean i guess you'll say it was
always clear but i mean this is just
shocking now peter navarro also has a
new book out
called taking back trump's america which
as of this morning was number four on
amazon
and i've been
pumping it up telling people to buy his
book because it's how he's going to pay
for his defense
you know i i don't know if he can even
make enough money from the book even if
it's the number one bestseller to pay
for the defense because the defense is
pretty expensive
but i thought
i don't like i don't like where this
went i don't like what my government did
and i would like to push a little power
back in his direction
so as
uh one small thing that i can do i've
been tweeting
support of his book and i bought it
myself of course so i pre-ordered it and
i would recommend that you do the same
if it gets to number one
then his his defense will be bolstered
both financially and
and in the public and i think that
that's the appropriate way to handle
this
now by the way mark meadows and dan
scavino who are in similar situations
did are not going to be charged
uh and the reason given is that they
cooperated a little bit so they're not
going to agree to testify
but in the case of mark meadows he gave
some documents and dan scavino has at
least talked to them a few times or
whatever
so
uh i think it was the fact that navarro
is being you know an absolutist about
this that got him in trouble
but
i feel as though
there were lots of reasons to not
support trump in a re-election
because he's divisive
am i right
he's divisive
the first time i supported trump
i don't know how often i've said this
directly in public
but let me tell you my real reason i
supported trump for the first time
i wanted him i wanted him to break
everything
because everything needed to be broken
i i wanted demolition demolition
and in a large way i got what i wanted
he did demolish everything
and not without its cost
right it's not free to demolish stuff
but i wanted things just broken
because it'd be at least a chance we
could build them back
better
uh
but there wasn't any chance they could
keep working the way they were working
so we needed somebody strong enough to
just break the system and that's what he
i think he did that in a number of ways
he don't he definitely broke the system
trump did in the sense that
there are things that we think about
differently permanently now
that part's completely different
uh certainly we want to understand fake
news
we just understand a lot more than we
did
but this peter navarro thing
is almost like a bat call for trump
and you know i suppose i'd want to hear
what desantis said about the situation
if he has anything to say about it but
if peter navarro ends up
serving jail time or something
for this
what appears to be haunting republicans
you know the whole january 6 witch-hunt
sort of thing which is not to say that
there were bad people who need to be
brought to justice
everybody understands there were some
bad people there who did illegal
dangerous things
so we're not talking about them we're
talking about the people who
we're just protesting
and
i don't know this peter navarro
treatment
this feels like it could happen to me
like actually literally me
like actually i saw myself in chains
because
you know navarro's uh
he's pretty close to the inner circle
but the real reason he's being treated
like this is because he's effective
it's because he's effective
and i worry that if somebody thinks i'm
too effective i will get taken out too
now as you might imagine
i have been warned that that's going to
happen
and warned by people who definitely know
what they're talking about
when they make warnings of that kind so
i know it's common for me
but
uh
we'll we'll see how interesting that
gets
so i would say that sometime between now
and
[Music]
2024 um
yeah i'll either get me tooed
or there'll be like a big fake news of
something i said that's out of context
something like that
yeah
but it's definitely coming my way
um i i don't mind a good fight so let's
let's bring that on
bring it on
all right um did you see the tweet
exchange between elon musk and the ceo
of another uh
electric car company called atlassian
at
atlassian
terrible name for a company and uh their
ceo was responding to the fact that musk
said people need to come to the actual
office to work at tesla
and they're one of their co-founders at
uh atlesian scott
farq
he tweeted a thread he was mocking musk
and he says today feels like something
out of the 1950s quote everyone at tesla
is required to spend a minimum of 40
hours in the office per week very
different approach to what we're we're
taking at atlassian and here's why and
he goes on to describe
their open
remote work culture and how successful
and economical and awesome it is
and then elon musk replies to the entire
thread this way
the above set of tweets illustrate why
recessions serve a vital economic
cleansing function
oh god
that is so funny
so he lets this guy just like
just use all of his ammo like this big
thread of how awesome they are and when
he's all done
well that illustrates why recession
serves a vital economic cleansing
function
that is so good
that's just so good
all right well the news of ukraine
is equally ridiculous
um
that putin has won everything he wanted
and the big worry is that we don't want
to humiliate him before we sue for peace
now wait a minute
don't we have to make up our mind
how can it be true
that putin has won everything he really
wanted which is 90 of the economic
engine of ukraine
you know plus a land bridge plus total
control of you know ukraine's access to
the the ocean
basically
basically putin won the war and he's
just consolidating it now
at the same time
the putin totally won the war
we're trying to make sure we don't make
him feel bad
or humiliate him for his gigantic
victory
what is happening
what is happening
[Laughter]
they can't both be true
does does putin think that he lost
are we worried that putin thinks he lost
because i think putin thinks
that he will tell
the russian people he won
he will add this gigantic economic
engine to russia they will adjust to the
sanctions
and probably come out ahead
if you had to ask me to score this
on economics alone now on evil it's evil
so you know on the evil checklist evil
yes or no oh yes yes it was evil
so we're not talking evil
that's no no contest
but economics
it looks to me like it was a good
investment
i hate to say it
because you don't want anybody to be
incentivized to do it again
but it does look like it's going to work
as of today
what do you think
i mean it's too hard to predict but as
of today it looks like it worked
and it looks like putin's maybe not
going to drop dead tomorrow and
looks like he will be the hero of russia
for consolidating that part of the world
and
i don't know i think he probably gained
more
than the sanctions will cost him in the
long run
assuming he could find workarounds and
places to sell his energy i think he
probably will
yeah wart was good for business so
that's not exactly what we hope to get
out of that is it
all right is there anything i didn't
talk about that you know i should have
um
weed variety what about it
who doesn't want to buy oil there
psycho provocations is what is evil
so do you think that
uh
how does the bind administration spin
the fact that they put 40
40 billion dollars into
losing
because what is it that we're
protecting there exactly
you know is the ukraine that's left
10 of the economic power of what it had
that's the part we're defending
because it feels like that's going to
just turn into farmland or something
i guess it probably is
um
oh navarro persuasion evaluation in
future live streams so the question is
was navarro persuasive i would say yes
because navarro uh
was visual
he talked about you know the actual you
could imagine the visual part of it
there were no i didn't see any pictures
has anybody seen pictures of him being
apprehended
i hate to say apprehended
no so he did a good job of describing it
especially with the
chains on the legs he also said that
they put him in
james hinckley's cell
because they thought it was funny
or they thought it was funny to mention
it to him just think about that
imagine being put in a hinckley cell
now
uh
all right
um indica or sativa
uh both it depends on time of day
all right
yeah do you think that my
prediction that
republicans would be hunted
was accurate
you know what i would love is if
somebody would put together a meme of
all the times that republicans have been
haunted
has anybody ever done that have you ever
seen it
because every time somebody says that
was great
one of the things i'm most criticized
for
actually
i think the things throughout my life
that i've been most criticized for
i was right
i guess it always works that way
um
all right
it does look like
we've been haunted
people say
yeah you know
so people think that that's my uh
dumbest thing i've ever said so when
when the people on the left want to
take my old tweets to embarrass me
which they do if i make a good point in
the present there should be a name for
people who
who try to show your past tweets
to criticize your current opinion
because it's ridiculous
either your current opinion makes sense
on its own or it doesn't you don't
really need to bring in the past do you
yeah
so just finishing my uh trump statement
about navarro if navarro goes down
as in goes to prison
over this specifically this
i feel like i'm all in on trump
and it wouldn't be even based on policy
again
it would i it would be based on him
breaking the system
so
if desantis would break the system like
maybe i could get behind him if he'd be
a little more free speech
that part does bother me
you know unfortunately we don't have
that the option of the politician who
gives us everything we want
you got to pick one who's 80 there at
best
you can't hinge on electing trump
yeah it's just trump's the only one who
could break the system at this point
but i think he might over break it there
is a risk
all right
um
i believe i have done everything i need
to do today my mission is complete
you're all smarter and happier
some of you are better looking
have any of you noticed that you get a
dopamine hit from watching this live
stream
anybody
is it
yeah you do
is there a point in the live stream
where you can feel it the most
it's the caffeine
so here's a little uh
thank you you do
now here's a little uh tip
if you want to
um train a human it's the same as
training a dog
now that's not an insult to humans
right are there enough dog lovers here
that you get that that's not an insult
to humans
that humans and dogs can be trained the
same way with treats
we go toward treats and we go away from
pain
so here's here's the rule
you can train people with traits two
different ways
you know simplifying
one
is a huge huge single trait
and people will work really hard to get
it like a a lottery you know people will
do irrational things to win a lottery
like buy a ticket
so you can train them with a delicious
gigantic treat
but you can also train people with micro
doses
of treats
just little imperceptible
benefits
and
by pairing the this show
with a sip of coffee even if you've had
several sips already and even if you
drink coffee every day the pairing of
the show with the sensation of the
coffee because the coffee gives you a
positive feeling
should
should in theory over time
be even it's the tiniest tiniest little
micro treat
it should addict you over time in a way
that when you come back it triggers the
dopamine
so we're actually setting up
a brain hack
and i'm doing this right in front of you
intentionally and with your permission
because if you don't like this
all you have to do is not drink coffee
or
or join late or so so it's yeah it's a
voluntary experiment
but you can see in the answers that it
works
if you just consistently pair the
positive
thing over time
those little micro benefits
add up
so this is one of the things you can do
in your social life
or your business life too
you can you can give people the smallest
smallest little benefits
as long as they're consistent
so that every time that they see you
they get this little micro treat
and they might not even register it
don't even know why
when people ask me how i'm doing
well actually what do you say
let me ask you this question i'll ask
you as if i walked past you on the
street
hey how are you
answer please how are you give me your
real answer the one you always use
all right i'm saying great good
fantastic tired amazing good terrific
doing well
fine
yep all right
here's what i like to say
amazing
because every time somebody says how you
doing and i say amazing
it makes them feel good
it does try it
if somebody says how are you doing you
just look at him and say amazing
they will feel good because you know
what feels good
hanging around with people who feel good
is like one of the best feelings in the
world there's nothing that like is
consistently
awesome and just being near somebody who
feels good
it just
comes off on you
so
here's the smallest little life hack
that could change your life completely
when somebody asks you how you do it
just say amazing
it doesn't even have to be true
but you will give them a little treat
every time they have that interaction
with you and over time
they'll have this positive feeling about
you and they won't even know why
they'll think it's because your good
looks and your sex appeal
but it will be because you literally
gave them a treat
every time you saw them
and it adds up
so the hypnotist worldview
is that we're
continuously engaged in treats and
penalties
and that if you don't see the world that
way then you're
inadvertently penalizing and treating
people so you're not getting a result
you want
because you're throwing treats into the
wind and you're throwing penalties into
the wind
and you're just randomly and if somebody
says why are you acting that way you'd
say i'm just being me
i'm just being me
i'm just being honest
well
you have that option
you can just be you
and you can be honest and that works for
a lot of people
but
if you want to be effective and happy
and have friends and stuff like that
then i would recommend that you don't do
that honest thing
that you do what is good for other
people
however that feels because that's how
you get the defeat the treats and you
build this virtuous feedback thing
so definitely don't be yourself and
don't be honest
if your alternative
is to be nice to people and give them
something that
you know can change them in a positive
way
somebody says i expect that retail
personnel are trained to ask customer
how's your day going
but whenever i ask if that's the case
they always deny it
i don't think it's part of the actual
training now
except that they probably observed
whoever trained them doing the same
thing i think it's just it's what you
say when you meet people
all right
um
what about accusations of what
uh of sounding fake
um well let me ask you this
if you saw me and you said how you doing
and i said amazing
would your first thought be well this
guy's such a fake i'll bet it's not so
amazing
would you think that
i don't think most of you would
i think most of you would say that i'm
saying that for a fact
and i'd rather be around somebody who
said positive things
you know the whole thing about
let me i'm going to go even further here
all right this is going to be a little
more provocative than you hoped for i'm
going to lose a few of you on this
people who think in that frame
of of people being fake versus not fake
are really disadvantaged in life
it's a very very
non-productive frame
so
just keep that in mind
um
well here's why
so if you're worried about who's fake
and who's not
you're losing the fact that it's all
fake
that's really important
it's really important if you think some
of it's true
you are going to have a terrible life
because you won't be able to navigate
that kind of reality
trying to figure out like who's being
authentic
and who is being fake
if you think some people are authentic
you'll never understand anything
there's no such thing as authentic
there's just what people do
whatever reason they do it they do it
they just do it
there's no this
so the whole what is fake and what isn't
is as soon as you allow that to be your
frame
you're lost
i would never hire somebody with that
frame of you
because that's they'd be lost in it they
wouldn't be able to navigate the real
world
i want somebody who says oh this guy's
acting fake but it's really working well
this one's acting fake but in a way that
isn't getting them what they want
so that's not working well
and this was acting fake in a way that
makes me feel good
oh i like that
yeah you should be choosing among the
fakes the positive fakes the good fakes
uh you should not be looking for the
truth
if you're looking for that you are lost
um
so there are some personal questions i'm
not going to answer so don't bother
asking
uh people connect to you more when
you're genuine
i'm sorry
[Laughter]
i'm sorry you believe that
uh
i don't know
there
there's definitely something to the fact
that in a
one-to-one personal relationship
that people are more likely to fall in
love with somebody who
shows you their flaws
are you with me so far
if somebody shows you their flaws you
can be comfortable with them and maybe
you think you know everything about them
that you need to know and then you can
really bond
but is that
a question of fake or not fake
see i think somebody who shows you their
flaws
is also
probably
aware that they've chosen an approach
see what i'm saying it's all fake
it's a strategy the people who say i'm
just going to be you know show you all
my flaws have decided that that's who
they are and then they're going to
present themselves that way
nothing's true these are just decisions
that people made
and they choose innocuous flaws exactly
yeah be careful the people who tell you
all their flaws
they might be holding out a few
it might be a few they haven't mentioned
yeah that's that's always something to
worry about
so but if if you tell yourself you live
in a world in which everybody is putting
on a show
then
you can understand everything
and you say to yourself what is your
obligation in a world in which
everybody's putting on a show
to put on a show
yeah you're part of the show
so do your part put it on your show
just make sure that the show you put on
is positive
like somebody's better off because of it
if i tell you that everything's going to
be fine
even if i think it's not
but there's also nothing you can do
about it
so you better you'd be better off not
worrying about it because there's
nothing you can do about it
that would be you know dishonest and
fake and all that right
but it would be well intentioned
and
sometimes that's the best you can do
the best you can do is good intentions
and i think the only way anybody ever
gets the good intentions
is by genuinely believe that that that
works out for them as well which i do
it is my observation
that having good intentions
usually works out for me like in a
selfish way it just takes longer it
takes a little bit longer for that
impact to work its way around but i'm
willing to wait a patient
yeah so don't try to be genuine
try to put on the show that's the best
show you can put on that helps the world
in youtube
or do you just seem patient
yeah
all right that's all for now
i'll talk to you
tomorrow bye youtube
